{"text":"So, interestingly enough, I was reading the reviews that the food was good (or great) but the service was terrible... honestly, I had just the opposite experience. The food could have been a lot better (I mean, the soup was almost cold), and the pasta flavor was very bland, but our waitress, she was a delight! If I remember correctly, I think her name is Jane (though memory could betray me). She was on top of her game- she is the only reason why I gave this place a 3 stars and not one. She made appropriate suggestions, was fast in processing our orders, and had a very pleasant personality. I sincerely hope Mimi's Cafe improves their food, otherwise, because in the restaurant industry, it's not just about the service or the food, it's about having the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times. The first two times were for lunch. The food was mediocre, at best.  Their breakfast menu looked so good, though, that I decided to give it a try. Let's just say that this place really needs a management overhaul. The whole experience was shockingly bad. First, we were greeted by a young man who kept wondering off, coming back by, saying, \"hold on,\" wondering off again, and then finally seating us in a restaurant that wasn't even particularly crowded. A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere. I can't say that I would recommend the place, unless they get new management and some major staff training, which is a shame because it's a nice  looking place and has a potentially good menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst breakfast I've ever eaten. Bacon over cooked, potatoes under cooked, fruit plate I wouldn't even eat and an English muffin that was as hard as a hockey puck. The only good thing was the eggs and fresh orange juice."}
{"text":"Should have gone to Dunkins Donuts.  At least we could have gotten fresh bagels.  Eggs benedict had no english muffin and even the carrot muffin was stale.  The butter was cold and hard.  The food was awful and there's a lot of old people around.  When did Mimi's become Coco's??"}
{"text":"I was in love with this place. Until I found a green like bug in my oysters! Made me sick... I still lose my lunch when they send me emails."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner after my car broke down and had it towed. The service was very efficient and friendly and we were seated right away. I had a salad their Mediterranean Chicken which was excellent and very fresh tasting. The bread was served warm which we love.So great place to go for dinner ."}
{"text":"It's a Monday night and it's practically dead at the restaurant. We arrive and the host tells us it'll be a five to ten minutes for our table, he then addresses the couple that came in behind us. We're commenting on the fireplace that is lit when the host takes us to a half-filled room and seats us at a table that was ready the entire time. So why did we have to wait?  We ask for a booth and he says they are all taken as the rest of the rooms in the café were closed. The couple that came in after us is seated in a booth in the other, supposedly closed, section of the restaurant. Really?   We browse through the menu, but what I saw online wasn't on the menu in front of me, though I found something else I could order. Our waitress is pleasant and smiling, but not in the fake way that so many servers do. I order the meatloaf and my boyfriend orders the chicken pot pie. They are out of chicken pot pie, apparently a woman sitting at a table behind us ordered the last one. He gets the chicken parmesan.  It's a very small dining area and everyone can see each other. There was a man with two little girls eating in a booth next to us. It was very sweet, he was talking with them and they were high fiving each other and overall seemed to be having a great time. No cell phones, no distractions, just the three of them enjoying time together. Something happened with one of the girls and she suddenly needed to go to the bathroom. He picked her up because she couldn't get her shoes back on and took both of them to the bathroom. Naturally he would take both, no? They were young, maybe 5 years old, not old enough where you would leave one by themselves in a restaurant. Almost immediately their waiter goes over to their table and stands there. Everyone eating there that night can see what is going on. The waiter was making hand gestures with the rest of the staff that the man was going to dine and dash; he wanted to clear off their table. They were not even done eating. A higher staff member said to give it five minutes before he cleared off their table. Now, as any parent knows, it's not always a quick in and out with children. Also, I want to add that the bathroom is nowhere near the front door. Their waiter keeps going back and forth from the kitchen to their table and standing over their table, gesturing and laughing with the staff the whole time. It was incredibly rude and unnecessary, not to mention awkward the way the waiter loomed over the table making a scene. It goes on for a good ten minutes, maybe more. This pisses off my boyfriend and I. We ask for our bill, and for the bill of the man and his two daughters.   You want to know what the restaurant was so worried about? Onion dip and two kids macaroni. They were drinking waters. Their bill was 24 dollars. So this restaurant is so shallow that they make a scene out of 24 dollars.  Our waitress asked if we knew them and we said no. She kept saying how sweet we were, but she didn't say anything on how rude the staff was.  My boyfriend ordered the family a cheesecake, paid the bills, and we left. Oh, and the family did go back to their table after they came from the bathroom and continued eating, they did not dine and dash. Their waiter acted like nothing had happened. He should have apologized to the man.   Although the meatloaf was great, the parmesan chicken was disgusting, and the staff was appalling. We will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch during the week and it was terrible. The portions are small, the service is well below average and the food was not good. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich , and it was extremely dry. The burger was ok, but the fries were burned and salty.  Never Again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for dinner. We were practically the only people in the restaurant - on a Friday night! Our server was not well trained and seemed more concerned about herself than her few customers. The food that we received was well cooked and good - however, it is not what we ordered. Both my wife and I were served the wrong dish! We aren't the type to send it back, so we didn't say anything... we just paid the bill - which took way to long to come to our table.  In short, good food, but the place felt like it was dying as it was deserted on a weekend night and the wait service was awful."}
{"text":"I ve been there before for breakfast and thought it was pretty good. I returned a few weeks ago for dinner with a group of 6.  I was very disapointed with the bread basket, banana bread and carrot cake , this is nice for a brunch , but for dinner ? I don't know. I ordered the quiche , which was pretty good, but it also came with a muffin ( strange combination ? ) and a fruit plate,,,,  Overall the restaurant is good and the food is nice , but I don't think they should open for dinner , or then maybe change their menu.."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The place was not busy at all when we got there, the hostess told us it would be a 5 minute wait for a table, OK, like I said the place was not busy at all. Sat and waited for 20 minutes, the 1st hostess disappeared and we had to find someone else to seat us. Waited another 10 minutes sitting at the table and no one came to take drink orders or anything. The table next to us said they also had to wait forever for their food.  Finally walked out and spoke to the girl who seated us and asked her why no one came to our table. No apology whatsoever, she just said were short staff and doing the best they can.   She also said they were trying to fix an incident because a customer was yelling at the wait staff and that customer had to escorted out, well I wonder why. Don't go here, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"We come here all the time because its close to home and there's somthing on the menu for everyone - healthminded or not, kids or adults - and it offers outdoor seating and a decent wine list. The servers have been there for years and are very warm toward us. Overall, its a solid choice for the family."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food but the service is the WORST! It's not just a fluke either, has happened several times! Poor management and nothing offered to amend the long wait, wrong order and lack of attention. Will not go here again."}
{"text":"Disgusting  To start my water came with dead flies in it. We were here on a weeknight and the place was really slow. Despite that it took an hr from time of order to get our food. The food came and it looked as if just out of the microwave. My friend ordered some fish that came with a salad covered in garlic sauce? Idk it was a bad joke at this point. This sauce made us all gag. We sent the fish back because it had the toughness of jerky and was stuck to the plate almost as if it had been burnt on. They gave us a dessert we didn't ask for...I think as an apology. But the dessert was really stale crepe cake that showed some freezer burn.  I felt really bad for the waiter. He was very nice and enthusiastic. A lot of the other employees didn't really seem to be doing much. I mean I would be embarrassed to serve that food, but it wasn't his fault. So for the waiter it would be 5 stars, but this place a total 1.  To top it off my friend was really sick the next day."}
{"text":"We went in search of a Saturday morning breakfast and landed here. My last few experience here (for dinners) were less than wonderful but I had good memories of the baked goods so thought it would be a good breakfast spot.  We were early (8:30a) so our service was great, our coffee never ran low. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and was disappointed. The spinach was not seasoned at all and the small drip of hollandaise sauce was lumpy; the seasoned potatoes were bland. My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash (one of his favorites for breakfast) the corned beef was clearly not fresh-made and came out as a slab of beef. The highlight of our breakfast was the apple streusel muffin that came with his breakfast. It was hot and gooey and we both really liked it. Sadly the muffin and service do not make up for the rest of the mediocre breakfast and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"On the night of 3/26/14, we decided to order takeout from Mimi's Cafe on N. Tatum. We were staying in the area and, although we had been to other Mimi's, we had never patronized this location before. According to Yelp, it was open until 11:00pm so we tried placing an order online. However, we kept getting an error message and ended up calling instead. As it turned out, this location actually closes at 9:00pm. They apologized for the confusion and said they were trying to get corporate to update the Yelp info. (Also, their online ordering system had pick-up times up to 11:00.) Despite it being just a few minutes before closing, they happily said we could still order. I rushed over to the restaurant arriving a few minutes after 9:00. The door was still unlocked and a few tables still occupied. I was quickly greeted and told our order was not quite ready. The three employees I interacted with could not have been nicer even though we felt we were being somewhat of an imposition with our literally last minute order. Our entrees and desserts were very good and very reasonably priced. Actually, and I know this sounds odd coming from a customer, I think the food was under-priced for what we got. A very good experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered the French toast plate.  It came with egg, bacon, and fruit.  Everything was decent.  Nothing spectacular.  Didn't taste any different than Denny's."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat, but lately not-so-much. The portions are getting smaller and the service even worse! Did they change management????     Tonight I went in at. 6:05 pm and found a parking spot up front because it wasn't terribly crowded. It all went downhill from there. I had a coupon for a buy one, get one and ordered one chicken dinner for here and one to go.  It took forever for my house meal to come and when it did, I was told that was the last of the chicken and was asked if I wanted a menu to order something different for my take out meal. It took another long while to get the menu. She dropped off the menu and I finished my tea and dinner before she ever came back! I was so thirsty! No refills! She finally came back to get my order. I asked if I could have a refill on my tea. I had to wait forever for that. My order came and she asked for my coupon number, which I gave her when she took the initial order. She said she lost it.  I went through my emails in my \"trash\" and tried to locate it. Finally my order came and I asked for the bill.  That took another 20 minutes. I got the bill and asked where the second drink was (you have to purchase two drinks and one entree). That was another 15 minutes... Normally I wouldn't have bothered, but it was $3.29!  All in all, I was there for over two hours!!!  This is the first time in my 60 years on earth that I did not leave a tip!! I may not go back and if anyone asks me, I certainly don't give a recommendation."}
{"text":"Breakfast fritata which came to me undercooked and not even warm. Cannot recomend at all. Been good in the past, but they tanked this morning."}
{"text":"This place can get a little hectic, if your not ready to hustle and buslte. But when considering the food alone its great. I have only had their breakfast, and both times it has been good. My friend had a Salmon and Egg salad (don't remember the name,m sorry!) and that was pretty good. All in all, i do not expect to go to a diner and have a Wolfgang Puck meal, it was just enough. The decor kind of makes the place set apart form other diners but the food is all in all pretty good. i'll return for a coffee thou, oh and their muffins are great too!"}
{"text":"We came here for Thanksgiving and have never been treated so poorly. The manager was in way over her head and had no control over the service or restaurant. Apparently reservations don't mean anything. A tip for all, skip this place or you'll wait to eat until 9pm when you have a reservation at 6:45."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here many times through the years and the muffins are really good. The breakfast menu is a slight step up from the average breakfast joint. Minus one star because a few times I've come in for breakfast late and the muffin i was served tasted microwaved."}
{"text":"what kind of a \"Chicken Taco\" comes with \"Potatoes\" in it more than Chicken ?? and pays more than $12 for it? Gosh.. if only this did not show up in my google maps.. i could have made better use of my money to fill up my belly .. Food tastes horrible.."}
{"text":"Food was good will return, coffee weak, but disappointed the signature Brioche dish was really a cinnamon bun!! Way too sweet for the dish too. Do they not know the difference?"}
{"text":"Stopped in late at night for a small bite to eat before meeting a friend elsewhere, I ended up ordering the seafood crepe! Although it wasn't busy the bartender Robert was nice to chat with and the crepe was delicious! I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Mimi's in Ahwatukee for Mother's Day. We were a party of 6 and I had made a reservation a week prior knowing they would be busy that day. We arrived at one o'clock for a reservation at the same time and waited 25 min to be seated. when they seated us, it was at 2 rickety tables thrown together right at the entrance to the dining room so that all guests and wait staff would have to be constantly trying to get around us when entering and leaving. one table was so wobbly you couldn't have eaten off of it and half of the chairs were METAL FOLDING CHAIRS...yes, the kind you sit in at Aunt Mary's backyard shindig. The metal chairs were bent and had metal poking my son in the back so he had to lean forward to sit in it. I told them this will not work and we want to be moved. We then went back to the lobby and waited another 10 minutes to be seated in a back room to the left that looked like overflow dining and the ambiance was crap. it looked like an old shed or something that had been converted for extra seating. They handed us the menu, which was 2 one sheet laminated menus and had very limited offerings for Mother's Day. When I made the reservation I specifically asked if it was full menu and was told yes because i have 2 kids that are picky eaters and knew they would order a hamburger. no hamburger on this menu. i asked the hostess if this was the full menu and she snottily said yes, that's it. I then asked the waiter why it was so limited and he had to go ask mgmt if they were serving full menu and came back with the lunch and dinner menus. I'm guessing they weren't but accommodated us after I complained.   The food was mediocre. I ordered the cranberry pesto turkey sandwich and they literally had about 9 fries on my plate. My kids that ordered burgers had a plate full but I had 9. I literally laughed out loud. The only bright spot was our waiter who was VERY attentive. They gave us each a free muffin to take home.   Then, to top it off, the next morning I went to use my debit card and realized it was missing. Tried to remember when I last used it...Mimi's. Called them and sure enough, they had it. It was then I realized that the waiter never brought my card back to me after he ran it. I remember the 2 white receipts in the billfold that I signed and no card. Yes, I should have realized it and asked about it before leaving so I take partial responsibility but they definitely dropped the ball yet again. when I walked into the restaurant to get the card, the manager checked my id and told me, \"glad you realized you forgot it. these things happen.\" No, I didn't forget it, your waiter never gave it back to me.  All in all, very disappointed in my experience on what was supposed to be a nice treat for my mom on Mother's Day. I might give Mimi's a second chance with a smaller party but i will NEVER take the chance of celebrating a special occasion there again. It really upset me that our Mother's Day was so blah."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time, and we came in for breakfast the other day, and it was delicious. Service was good, and everything came pretty quick. My gf's order had fruit with it, which we didn't know about for whatever reason, and when she ordered a side of fruit, the server evidently didn't think to mention that her food already came with it, and so we got double fruit. Odd."}
{"text":"My wife and i went to mimis on bell road in glendale.  It was the worst meal we ever had.  I had the fish and chips, they were not fresh and were full of Grease.. My wife had some kind of pasta, it was over cooked, and was swimming in marinara.  Not good at all.  Won,t go back.  we would rate it with - 2 stars."}
{"text":"Booooooo! This place was a ghost town and past its prime. Boring food lame atmosphere. Not my cup of tea.. But if you're in your eighties you may just love this."}
{"text":"Love this Mimi's. My favorite breakfast dish is the crab cake egg benedict. The service is always fantastic, and there are always great coupons you can sign up for! Simple and sweet, this place is a comfy, fun place to fill up on a yummy breakfast!"}
{"text":"a lot of tacky decor a lot of average wait help a lot of messiness in the bathroom a lot a lot of very average food and... a lot of old people"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? My husband and I used to love going to Mimi's for breakfast when we lived in Las Vegas and decided to eat there on a rescent visit there and boy were we disappointed.  Our food was nothing spectacular but what did stand out was the total ineptness of our server. She was completely inattentive of the needs of her tables (2) and in my opinion, lacked the charisma it takes to work as a food server.  Overall, extremely sad that this place has become what it has :-("}
{"text":"I don't know why it only has 3 stars? I hadn't been to Mimi's in a long time and decided with the help of a coupon for a two for one how could we go wrong. Delicious food and great service. The menu has changed quite bit and the food has become unique. All staff was cordial and great atmosphere!  Would recommend greatly!"}
{"text":"Used to love Mimi's but not a fan of the new menu in the least. I like new items but to totally re create the menu and not leave the classic favorites seems silly. Disappointed"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was terrible.  We waited two hours for our meal and some of the children were served last to be served.  Some of our favorite meals were discontinued from the menu."}
{"text":"My experience here started out fine.  We were seated fairly quickly and our waitress came and got our drink orders right away.  We then decided what we wanted to eat and ordered.  We got our soup right away, but there was quite a lag between getting our soup and our food.  When it was almost to the point where we were ready to flag someone down and ask what was going on our food arrived.  My food was cold when it arrived.  I also did not like the special that I had ordered (chicken Madeira crepes) mostly because it was a soggy mess (probably from sitting for too long before it finally got brought to the table).  I guess next time I will stick with chicken pot pie.  My husband got a blue cheese burger and said it was good.  Sometime while we were eating, our waitress just seemed to disappear.  We had ordered dessert when we ordered our meals so it was just a matter of letting her know we were ready for it.  We waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally she came out and said she would get started on our desserts.  We waited some more.  When someone from the back finally brought our desserts out to us he handed me the triple chocolate brownie.  But I ordered the chocolate mousse.  When I brought this to his attention he informed me that they didn't sell the chocolate mousse anymore and hadn't for about a month.  Okay, well, it was on the menu, I ordered it, and the waitress didn't say anything but subbed a brownie without asking me if that was okay?  Not cool in my book!  After we got our dessert situation settled we ate them and then waited for the check.  And waited, and waited.... Finally I had to take my kids out to the car because it was just taking too long and they were done.  My husband came out to join us about 15 minutes later.  We clocked our visit at just over 2 hours, and that was because we were constantly waiting on the food or the waitress.  Add that to the fact that my meal was sub-par and the whole dessert fiasco, I can say we will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and it was not very good.  We hadn't been to Mimi's in years and wanted to give it another shot.  We left quite disappointed and saying that we would not return any time soon.  We started out with the crab something-or-other (can't remember the name of it) and they were deep fried balls with some crab and other veggies inside.  They were ok. We also started out with the shrimp bruscetta with toast.  That was just ok.  The waitress had forgotten to bring our bread, we had to ask for it.  We thought maybe they had done away with that practice.  My daughter had the tomato bisque soup and that was really good.  For dinner my husband had the chicken fried steak, my first daughter had the kids' spaghetti and marina and the other daughter had the lobster ravioli (3 course special).  I had the chicken pasta dish.  The chicken fried steak dinner looked like it had been taken out of the freezer, defrosted, and served to him.  There was absolutely nothing good about it.  The meat was very salty (as if it was preservative-laden).  The kids' meal was fine.  The lobster ravioloi was really good but the sauce was way too rich and hard too eat too much of it before you started feeling \"gross\". And my meal was pretty decent.  The chicken was encrusted in panko and cooked really well.    If I were to go back, it would be to try their breakfast. Maybe its more of a breakfast place, I don't know.  But we will never return for dinner.    I really love the ambiance of this place - so its disappointing that the food doesn't live up to the rest of the place.  It could be such a fun dining experience, and very family oriented."}
{"text":"I like it here, it's across my office. It's perfect for lunch, they have a lunch menu both healthy and unhealthy choices. I like their salmon dish, salads and Iced tea. Their muffins are great too. Good service."}
{"text":"Fabulous omelettes - my friend and I shared the Andouille Sasage & Red Pepper and Bacon Avocado versions! We also indulged with their spicy Absolut Bloody Mary's! Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences at a restaurant. Had a reservation for 10, however when we arrived (early) we were notified it would be some time as they just sat a table for 10. After a 30 min wait (why have a reservation if you are going to wait!) we finally sat down. Upon receiving our food (an hour later) all but one dish was completely cold.  Needless to say we will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok. It calls itself a French restaurant (maybe New Orleans \"French\"? Or Disneyland \"French\"), but I think the French people I know would giggle at best or sneer at worst at the suggestion that Mimi's is French. The breads, for a start, are more like cake. The main courses are Americanized versions of French cuisine...pretty stodgy fare.  The desserts were good (but still American).  I haven't been back for breakfast or to try the baked goods yet...some reviews tout these as Mimi's forte. Well, I hope they are...otherwise, this restaurant won't be able to hold my interest..."}
{"text":"I have always felt the price point at Mimi's is high for what you get.  Menu selections are average.  My wife loves this place, she would give it 4 stars, but unfortunately I am writing the review,"}
{"text":"The service was great as usual when you visit any Mimi's in the US. But, one thing was the worst was the bathroom. No toilet paper, bathroom was filthy. It looks like it hasn't been clean in about a month. Very sad to see when they carry a great reputation at all the locations. I hope the next time I visit it has shaped up."}
{"text":"The nicest way I can say it is reservations are a challenge for these people. After waiting an hour and a half for a table that we made a reservation for 3 weeks in advance and watching numerous parties of our same size be seated ahead of us without reservations, I came to the conclusion these people don't understand the process of reservations. Standing in the waiting area with 3 small children under the age of 5 all as well behaved as they could possibly be at that age, I was ready to leave if it was not for my pregnant sister who really wanted to eat here. At least the manager had enough sense to cover the cost of our meal for our party of 9 however it took her an hour and a half to realize that our wait was ridiculous.  If it was not for the server who worked 20+ years at the Monte Carlo and was used to dealing with upset customers I was ready to give a review of 1 star because Yelp will not allow a 0 star review. At the least I was amble to leave the restaurant without being upset with the service however it will be a long time before I return here.   If you do not have the greatest patience I would recommend finding a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Average pricing of about $9 a plate, Food was okay, fresh fruit and very good specialty muffins... But the omelettes were not impressive. The spinach was not fresh and our waitress was horrible. She kept getting our drink orders wrong and had to ask for knives two times before getting them. She was not very friendly or accomodating, and it took her 15 minutes to return our credit card when we paid. Our table was never cleared off either."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone downhill fast.  Probably due to the current manager, Sally who doesn't train  her help.  Order was totally mixed up, no coffee, burned soup, Meal served partially to group in stages, the last portion arriving after first served were done eating.   Place not full like it used to be.  Also found many negative reviews on internet.  Used to eat there regularly, won't be back again.  Either close it or change management."}
{"text":"I did a work catering order a couple of months ago with this Mimi's and had such a great experience the hubby and I decided to try it for breakfast a couple of weeks ago!   What a difference a couple of years makes!    Everything was fresh and delicious with friendly service throughout.  I love their egg white omelettes!  Bloody Mary was very tasty too!  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Mimi's cafe was recommended to us by a relative.  We ate there a few times now, always breakfast and will definitely return. I really enjoyed the food and their muffins. We also got always good service. There is, I believe 10%, discount for AAA members :-)."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with beautiful jazz background music Attentive waiters. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this Mimi's.  I love them all, but this one is the best of a great chain.  I don't often find myself near one, but when I do I usually make the most of it.  The french onion soup is wonderful, and I've never had a bad sandwich there.  Breakfasts are works of art, so good looking that I hesitate a half second before digging in.  The muffins, breads, and rolls are always tasty.  The rest of the menu is excellent, with various offerings of classics like meat loaf, sandwiches, fish and chips, salads, and classic entrees.  Don't forget dessert, big enough  to share, but good enough not to want to.  And service?  Service is usually excellent (barring misadventure) and is usually friendly.  You will get all the time you need to enjoy your meal without feeling abandoned or pressured.  In the few instances where things were not what they should be, the manager made a point of making it right.  I'm always looking forward to my next visit, and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered Shrimp and Chicken Fettucine and Dijon Salmon with salad and soup. Pea soup, salmon and regular salad was pretty good. The fettucine was so confusing, the taste was so mixed and the spice overpowered everything. It was not worth it.   They have 3 seating areas - the bar, and 2 separate large seating areas. We sat near the kitchen area, it was so dark and not very inviting. Our waitress was slow and was not paying attention at all. We arrived just past 5pm and it was not busy at all. Out table was filled with our started bread, salad, soup in addition to our main dish, she did not offered to put away anything. No iced tea refill offered, we waited forever to catch her attention to get our desert, it was so long that we just asked to wrap our desert to-go. It was not a good first experience at that branch. I hope next time will be better"}
{"text":"We were there today for breakfast. After we received our food, we saw a cockroach climbing up the pillar attached to our booth. A big brown one.  We called over the waitress who proceed to slap the insect down with a menu and steps on it.  Another employee comes over and kicks the dead cockroach to the entry hall.  After 10 minutes the manager comes over to apologize and tells us that they are sorry about the visitor.  That's it.  We would not touch our food.  It was just sitting there. We paid ( full price) and left.  Just disgusting. They did not seemed bothered at all by the \" visitor\" which makes me wonder how often they have visitors and where else in the restaurant these visitors hang out.  Won't be back ever!"}
{"text":"We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding, and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner."}
{"text":"Why did Mimi's take all the good meals off the menu. No steak & eggs! No Santa Fe omelette!. Their new potatoes have no flavor."}
{"text":"We like Mimi's. It's a fun little cafe with a cute atmosphere. The food is average but we usually don't have a long wait to get in and the service is always good. The waiters are friendly and always interact with my kids which makes it fun for them."}
{"text":"Great food nice atmosphere server Belinda was very friendly and fast even with busy station on father's day most definitely we WI come back again"}
{"text":"This place needs a little work at the front door just one person sitting people on rush hour also servers need to focuss more on beverages refills, food was good very taste and fresh"}
{"text":"We have been there several times. First time everything was great. It seems the more often we go the worse the service is. I'm pretty sure we will not be going back. Bussers busy trying to talk to hostess instead of bussing dirty tables that had been there before we even arrived. Waiter not listening to our order because he was too busy looking around"}
{"text":"This is the best deal out there. Wife and I wanted something light for dinner, we both ordered French Onion Soup which comes with an assorted breadbasket. Soup and bread were fantastic, and the bill came to $11.22 including tax! We tipped extra because I was kind of embarrassed by how low our bill was, and the service was great. This is a great choice for a light meal."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. Stopped in with no info. Ordered deviled eggs and meatballs for appetizers. Very good. Prices very reasonable. Quality good. Bread options were also good. Carrot/nut, French baguette. Interesting, fun menu items. Decor is more for the older crowd but clean/comfortable."}
{"text":"This is the third chance i've gave mimi's cafe. The food is good, the hostess are sweet but the servers are terrible. I'm saying this now on my third time here where i've witnessed if you're not white or rich you're going to get -10 customer service. No smile, slow service, terrible facial expressions towards us and such a bad attitude. Like i've said, i've tried again and again hoping for a better experience but got the same each time. That was defiantly the very last time i go there."}
{"text":"Excellent service with tasty food. I had the berry pancakes with cinnaglaze topping. To die for! Best pancakes ever. Will definitely return again and again!"}
{"text":"Really amazing burger....Cheese, Thousand island, lettuce, tomato, avocado, red onion, on grilled garlic Parmesan sour dough bread Bam!   Honestly, just a really good flavored burger rmeat, and the with toppings.... just had to comment."}
{"text":"Mimi's is unlike many other big chains because their food is French inspired, and most people go here for their favorites...French onion soup, corn chowder, muffins, and the carrot bread.  But I think most everything on the menu is very flavorful and delicious.  It's unique from the other big chains. I love the decor...so cozy and lots of things to look at. I also love the free bread basket for dinner. Sometimes I have been here and service has been a little slow, but they always make it up to you with free food.  I love Mimi's!  We go here quite often."}
{"text":"Ugg the service and food was just awful.Last time i ate here it was good,but last night was ridiculous.The server was rude and apathetic.She moved at the pace of a turtle,never smiled or showed any interest in how our food tasted.She let us sit with empty drinks for 10 minutes. i have never seen such a poorly run restaraunt in all my life.IT was not busy,and food took forever,along with everything else.When my chicken finally arrived,it was stringy and undercooked.I dont know how they managed to not cook my chicken properly,since i waited a half an hour for it.when we left the clueless manager was sitting on her butt at the bar,smiling and waving goodbye,like she thought everything was a o.k.I will never eat here again.the only good thing was the bread, which they are very stingy with the portion size."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!!!!!!  We have been there several times, trying to give them a chance. DO NOT go there.  We went for Father's Day last year......and we've been there before with problems.  But our son decided to take his father there for Father's Day...When we signed in they told us it would be 30 minutes...........Okay...I can live with that, but it was an hour and a half before we were seated.  I know during a holiday, it's difficult to time seating.........but from what I know from the restaurant business they tell you longer time than it should really be.......and that is not what happened.............We thought we would sweat to death waiting to get in....and the person who was signing us in for the table was the most OBNOXIOUS person I ever met in my life.  She acted as if she was doing us a favor just having us in HER restaurant.  I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go back there again.  They REALLY need to work on their service.....DON'T go there Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!  Trust me.  Their food is good, if you ever get a chance to get it.  It is NOT worth the wait and the way the staff treats. There are too many other good places to go .........We eat out almost everyday    They are losing a lot of business.  They should be embarrassed...........NO STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. Granted it was at a Thanksgiving dinner and was very busy, but two hours later the food arrived and was NOT correct. Sent out a kid who barley spoke any English to try and ask who ordered what. Cold soup followed by small portions, no pumpkin pie, and over 20 dollars a person. If I could I would give negative stars. First and last time eating at Mimi's.  UPDATE: So we waited 45 minutes to be seated, that was not so much an issue as was waiting for another hour just to get some bread. THAT should have been done as soon as possible to keep us poor hungry folk satisfied for the foreseeable future. another half hour later we got our cold soup. A Half hour after that we got our dinner finally. Canned meat and decent sides was a serviceable dinner, but not what was expected from what was by all accounts a fine eating establishment. Our first contact was with our waitress taking drink orders, this happened in a timely manner, except that she informed us that they were out of Pumpkin pie already. as you have read, it was all uphill after that! BUT when  we saw the table next to us, a table that was seated an hour and a half AFTER us, but somehow got to desert BEFORE us, AND WITH PUMPKIN PIE NO LESS, well, that was when dad decided to complain to the management.   Finally after all this, the manager comped us the meal, but then as my cousin was walking out sarcastically said thanks for showing us what we keep doing wrong. So that's when I had to open MY big mouth and say \"You do not get to comp our meal then bitch about our complaint\"! So the manager took me aside and told me she was being sincere, that is was not in her power to seat us when people were staying two hours past finishing their meal. WAIT? WHAT? so someone who already ate was the reason we were told you were out of Pumpkin pie, served us cold soup, and waited an hour to serve us bread?  NO, I did not say that. I just told here I was walking away as it was not my business, I did not make the reservation, and I did not hear the remark. I was just served by an incompetent waitress who had but one small section to serve, and managed to serve EVERYONE BUT US first!  Reservation was for 5:30 Sat down at 6:15 Bread served at 7:15 Cold soup at ABOUT 7:35 Dinner was served at  just before 8:00. Doors closed at 8:30. this means we were supposed to be seated three hours before the restaurant closed, not finishing up dinner at 8:45! just about got out of there by 9 pm.\ Canned Turkey? REALLY?"}
{"text":"A-OK pretty much describe my Sunday brunch experience at Mimi's.    Yup, it's a chain...but a chain that accomodate big groups well.  Extensive selection ensures that there is something acceptable on the menu for everyone.  Service was freindly and they got our party of 10 well taken care of, despite last minute changes during the fast and furious round of ordering."}
{"text":"this mimis has gone way down hill, acouple managment changes really hasnt helped much"}
{"text":"I don't go to Mimi's for over a year, and I come back to a Denny's breakfast?  So, I had been to Mimi's many times for breakfast in the past.  It was certainly not a gourmet meal, but it was always a good place to get waffles and a side of potatoes.  Plus they had fresh-squeezed orange juice that I would always want, but then scoff at the price and decide against.  I hadn't been back to Mimi's in quite some time.  Not sure why.  But when I came back I couldn't believe how different the food was.  It still looked pretty much the same, but I guess the quality had gone downhill.  The eggs were bland, the waffle was bland, and the potatoes that I used to love were awful.  They were too soft and, you guess it, bland.  Plus the orange juice was from a carton- but the good news is they lowered the price.  My husband and I both left half of the food on our plates.  That is highly unusual.  Sorry, Mimi's, but I don't think I'll be back for quite some time again."}
{"text":"Always excellent food whenever we dine at Mimi's, we have gone to the same one and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"$4.99 KID MEALS won me over. Im a family of four with two kids  so finding a place that gives my kids something to eat for cheap is great! You have many options to choose from. A good place for breakfast, lunch and Dinner dates with the Hubby . cheap wines and more.I wish i had one closer"}
{"text":"We walked in and it looked nice, the hostess said it would be 10 minutes wait, but there were several open tables. It was a long day so we opted to wait at the bar. The male bartender was busy talking to a couple of ladies and completely ignored us. We tried to get his attention and he turned away to continue his chat with the ladies. After several minutes we had still not been acknowledged and still no table so we left. Too bad as we have no interest for a return visit,"}
{"text":"Sunday (6/8/2014) my sister & I took my mother to Mimi's Cafe for her birthday.  We originally were going to go to the location at Metro Center, but this location has closed.  We were greeted right away by the hostess when we walked in, and were seated immediately.  Once seated the waitress was there right away to take our drink order.  After returning with our drinks she proceeded to take our food order.  We did not wait more than 15-20 minutes for our food to be served, and overall our meals were good. We also ordered dessert, a chocolate lava cake. Which was not too bad."}
{"text":"Mimi's has a good low calorie menu and solid service. The coffee is excellent. Muffins and coffee are free for waiting customers in the morning."}
{"text":"First impression I'm sold   Great service for being busy. I liked our smoothie and our hot meals but the muffin I got wasnt the best. good coffee and love the decor. and for as packed as it was it was quiet."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone downhill over the last year or two.  I ordered my usual, steel cut oats. for breakfast and they arrived in a big lump with a strange flavor.  Hubby ordered an omelet which did not taste fresh.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Thai Chicken Peanut Wrap... delicious!! Corn chowder soup is awesome too!"}
{"text":"We came here last evening for a thanksgiving dinner.  The place was very busy at 6:00 pm, & we had to wait for a table for almost 40 mins.  But the wait was worthwhile because the server was awesome!  She was very attentive & very polite!  My French onion soup was luke warm & she wanted to make me a fresh new one, but I turned her offer down & she heated it up instead.  Overall, it was a wonderful meal served by a wonderful waitress!"}
{"text":"The service was wonder both times I took my family who flew down from NYC. The muffins were to die for and the breakfast was so freaking yummy. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat, I actually ate here for lunch and dinner yesterday! Lunch was great, I got the Chicken mac and cheese. It wasn't as creamy as usual but it was still delicious. Then for dinner, me and a couple friends ordered for take out. We called, picked it up and by the time we got back home (two minutes away from the store) the food was all completely cold. Kinda a bummer since it is usually so good. We called and the manager comped us the meal, which was really nice. I'll be back of course, maybe just more so to dine in!"}
{"text":"Very good... Like the all day breakfast menu.  Just had a light meal - bacon Mac n cheese.  My wife had an omelette.  Good food and service, incredibly diverse menu."}
{"text":"The problem with this restaurant seems to be corporate oversight. I ordered \"onion strings\" with a bacon burger. The meat under the bun was piled high with \"onion strings\" . Well, I had \"onion strings\" on the side anyways and the burger needed a slice of onion. I was told by the manager that the placing of the  \"strings\" under the bun was a corporate management decision. The \"strings\" were very greasy and ruined the burger.   I decided not to ask for a carryout box for the 2/3 remains. My pet eats better.  The café could shine if the chefs were allowed to prepare food properly."}
{"text":"My sister, brother, his wife, my husband and 2 friends we grew up with all met at Mimi's yesterday for a get-together.  Our friends are down here for a few weeks and my husband and I are snowbirds.  My brother, his wife and my sister all live here so this was a great place that was nice and convenient for all of us coming from various towns.  It couldn't have gone better.  First of all our waitress was wonderful (sorry I didn't get her name) and was very attentive and friendly.  The food was great.  And no one rushed us to leave since it was obvious we were wanting to just visit and visit.  We were there for a very long time - the place was getting empty.  Yet we still were not rushed to leave.  I have always enjoyed Mimi's but never done a review.  I felt it was about time!  Thanks for letting us have a wonderful visit and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix with a bunch of friends for spring training and we ended up at Mimi's one night. Friendly, attentive staff and a nice atmosphere. I had one of their \"special menu\" items - butter squash ravioli with shrimp.  It was horrible. Tasted rubbery and as if it was made hours ahead of time and kept under heat lamps. I would return but next time I'll get something simple like a salad or a sandwich. Stick to the basics and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"After an all nighter of working the scene me and the crew hit this place up . Breakfast is the bomb ditty, our servers love us and we are takin well care of. Pancakes with gravy, hash browns wit ranch  is how we do it.We will be back again,again and again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. The service was friendly and efficient, the atmosphere was nice, the food was ok, the coffee was watery, blah."}
{"text":"Well it was a beautiful Sunday...until we went here for food..big mistake...We are new to Phoneix just been here 3 weeks..And we were were hoping as it was owned by Bob Evans..it would be similar to the home cooking we were use to coming from MIchigan...So very wrong...first off greeted by BonJour!! really...we should have walked right then...Dennys would have been better..To late for Eggs B that i had been craving so settled for the egg white frattata..omg horrible..undercooked not flavor and turkey sausages really can you cook them...My partner had the roasted chicken crepes...omg what is that sauce....and the so called balsamic dressed greeens...so sweet it made your teeth hurt....it was horrible and we will never be gong back...and we will tell our friends dont go there ever....there should be a ZERO star..Yelp needs to have a lower scale.....and we wish we would have check Yelp before going...wont make that mistake again...."}
{"text":"Amazing place to come and eat! Food is great but the best part of my experience was the staff and the managers! They were so outgoing and friendly! I will be back because of the staff! The manager Damon was so nice and he was the first one to great us and check up on us throughout! Great family place to go and have dinner!"}
{"text":"I applaud the waitress Gin for noticing I wasn't eating my meal. Then the chef came out, who was very polite and asked what was wrong. I think any restaurant that takes a moment to identify customer service is the reason people come back. With that being said, great job to the staff and management that corrected the problem. My husband and I were very impressed."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe...let me take a deep breath before I start.  My love for Mimi started in the 90's. She was a quaint old gal, that welcomed you into her place with open arms. She seemed so different than all the others with her unique decor and subtle touches. She had beautiful pink tablecloths for breakfast and black and white checkered tablecloths for dinner. She had fresh flowers at each table. Her staff was well trained, attentive and dressed in bright colored aprons. Her food was excellent and plentiful. She would include sliced oranges as a garnish for the breakfast plates. She had colorful plates, with different designs around the edges. When she put your plate in front of you, you would say 'wow'! I would visit her every chance I got, to try a different muffin every time and partake in the soup that warmed my soul. She was consistently great and I looked forward to seeing her every time.   However, Mimi was sold to a new ownership group and her charm did not come along...  The last time I visited my old gal, she wasn't as welcoming. She didn't have any table clothes covering her plain wooden tables. She didn't have any flowers on the tables. Her staff is dressed in all black and not as attentive or knowledgeable. Her food is average and scarce. She uses plain white plates, with no garnish alongside the food. When she puts the plate in front of you, you wonder why you gave her another chance. She is consistently bad and I can no longer watch her continue to decline.   If you do decide to visit my old friend, you may have a better experience, simply because you did not visit her in her prime.   The old Mimi's Cafe...she ain't what she used to be, many long years ago :-("}
{"text":"This is the place your grandparents will love, your parents will love, and you well, you will not.  It's kind of like Grandma's kitchen in chain fashion. It's consistent like Kendo U. said, but I wouldn't say it's good by any means. It's bleh. It's chain bleh. Service is nice and they are hardly ever busy, but I prefer busy and bad service to bleh food. BLEH."}
{"text":"Worst service and meal ever. Food took forever.  Asked for salad without olives- extra olives delivered.  There also was a piece of plastic found in the middle of my salad.  Had a bad experience about a year ago, but the family wanted to give it another try--- never again.  Wish I could give it negative stars.  I have only provided the highlights of the experience."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe was once a great place for great breakfast and lunch, They have lost their way, big time! I remember when everything on the menu looked tempting. Today There was nothing on the entire menu that looked appealing!  Service from our waiter was good but the food lacked any resemblance of looks or flavor.  Sad really this was a family favorite. Now it's a place we will avoid."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants. I go there almost every weekend for breakfast. This review is not for the service or the quality of their food. This is because when you think you are getting whipped butter, you are actually getting margarine. I am shocked that in this day and age a restaurant would deceive its customer and put your health at risk. They do have butter available in the form of what they call \"chips\". Beware."}
{"text":"We started coming here about a month ago, the menu HAD so many great choices. We loved the buffalo chicken strips! We came in today for lunch (5/13) the menu changed, so many great items GONE! Very limited choices now. The food was so bad we didn't eat. Prices are still up there.. We won't be back, unless the old menu comes back too."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience, however, the price does not match the product.  We also found the atmosphere to be somewhat confusing.  The outside speaks of a cute, provincial, country-inspired cottage.  The inside, however, is a combination of French/Louisiana inspired food and decor.  Our server was very friendly, but overall, it seemed like it was missing the mark."}
{"text":"Great visit, I enjoyed the food and the surroundings are great. I had the Mushroom, Spinach, and Brie Omelet. My Wife had the Quiche Lorraine. Both were good, the Menu isn't what I would usually eat but I was presently surprised Our Waitress was very attentive Sue did a great job!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Mimi's in Glendale this past Weekend.  The wait staff was not very attentive and the breakfast was burned, missing sauce (how the cooks and the waiter missed this is a mystery) I'd sent it back for eggs.  A (manager?) later approached us to confirm they'd screwed up the breakfast though only offered half-hearted apology and walked off.  I don't think we're going back there."}
{"text":"I will give this place two stars because I loved my breakfast.  However, the rest of the party not so much.  The food was brought out in shifts.  By the time the first group was done eating I got my meal and only half of it. Three people ordered the same thing and one person got something totally different.  One persons food looked and tasted like it had sat for 30 minutes after being cooked.  Breakfast was 2 hours, which is ridiculous but should have been expected when it took the waitress 20 minutes to show up to get our drink order.  Never refilled drinks without asking several times and never got things we asked for like butter.  Horrible experience, my mom said she will never return but I may try another location because my food was great."}
{"text":"There is so much to say about this place. It is so inconsistent. Some days it is good food, some days it is so bad. The coupons are a joke. After adding 2 overpriced soft drinks, you could have just paid for 2 entrees. This last visit was a doozy however, so I thought I would share.  Armed with a buy one/get one coupon (must purchase drinks), we go into Mimi's to get some steak and eggs. Pretty easy, both entrees the same. We order, both steaks medium. eggs over medium, again easy.  The entrees come, my steak is still mooing, blood running all over the eggs. I ask the waitress to please have it cooked a bit more. She takes the steak, leaving me the eggs and returns it to the kitchen. Steak and eggs are meant to be eaten together, so I wait.  Steak comes back a bit browner on top and I proceed to take a bite. First bite was better, however as I cut into the middle of the steak, it was cold and clearly on the rare side. As the manager passed, I asked him if he could please have the steak cooked as ordered. He took my entire plate (eggs, potatoes and steak) and headed back to the kitchen.  About 5 mins later, he reappeared with a hockey puck on a saucer and proceeded to place that in front of me. This \"steak\" as hard as a rock. I asked, where are the eggs and potatoes that he had taken away, to which he responded \"Oh, you wanted those?\".   After sawing through this joke of a steak, the manager returned with 2 eggs on a saucer (sunny side up and not what I ordered) with no potatoes. I stated that this steak was inedible and that I just wanted to cancel the order and he can keep the eggs as well.  The lovely waitress comes over and places a bill of 23.00 on the table. I explained to the waitress that this was unacceptable as I had a buy one get one coupon and the bill is the same as if we had both eaten our meal. I said, I don't mind paying for the coffees and maybe 1/2 the entrée that was eaten, however to pay the same amount as if we both had eaten seemed unfair.  She puts the bill back on the table and says \"Well the manager did this and now you can use the coupon again next time\". As if this is a golden coupon. As if this coupon is exclusive! Google Mimi's coupons and you will see these are readily available.  I ask to speak with said manager. I explain my situation, he looks puzzled however ends up \"as a favor\" comping the entire bill. Wow, Thanks.  Get it together Mimi's."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never been disappointed.  Good food, interesting menu, nice portion size and great prices.  I come back every time I am in the area.  I love the mussels, Mac n cheese and burgers in particular."}
{"text":"I love Mimi's Cafe.  the food is yummy and it's always been a great place to go!  however, lately the service has been awful!  The past 3 times i have gone have been disappointing.  It makes me NOT want to go back again. :(  management needs to step in and take care of their customers!"}
{"text":"We were just here for our 25th anniversary this morning. Place was semi empty. Took 10 minute to get a seat. Took 15 minutes once seated to ask if we are going to get served. Ordered a decaf and late. Took another 10 minutes to get my decaf and it was cold. We were still craving the menu so we left and headed to the desert ridge location. Thanks for waiting out time."}
{"text":"Food was really good, they do have splenda...(kid with diabetes) is a most for us.  The service we got was excellent... my only gripe, is at the door when you are trying to get a table, they need to figure out a better way to handle that... empty tables on a Sunday, with pack waiting area is not good."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my mom when I was younger, haven't been in a while but everything was always good, the only thing is that some of my old favorite items were taken off the menu like the irish nachos, but everything is yummy. Do visit this place."}
{"text":"The food was cold. Also we went for breakfast, and they only had 2 kinds of muffins. The waitress told us that other flavors that were advertised on the menu had not been made. That was not good. Also, I can't stand when a waitress just tops my coffee off without asking. I had my coffee sugared and creamed the way I like before she came along and ruined it. The table didn't have enough cream to fix my coffee. I will never eat there again. It was awful And expensive."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. The food is semi decent, but not great. Every surrounding restaurant is much better. The service here is a joke. They don't respect their customers. Especially the guys that work there. Don't come here. There are better places on Bell rd."}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants . However Mimi's Cafe  is an exception. Good food, and great service, and good prices have been my experience, and I would recommend !"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  The food was fantastic and service was great.  I live nearby and was very hesitant to try this place because of the horrible reviews, but it was nothing like the bad things people said.  Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Interestingly enough they serve breakfast all day but after one bite of the eggs, our table noticed the eggs had mold inside of them (or some form of expiration) and they were half green. The manager tried convincing us there was nothing wrong with them and claimed it was blueberries. We lost our appetite and left, never to return again."}
{"text":"I been here several times for brunch. The servers usually aren't too bad but this has to be the SLOWEST place I've EVER been to in my life. The food is decent not amazing. Just good enough to make me come back. As long as I'm in no hurry whatsoever. I have noticed that they screw you on the fresh fruit that comes with certain meals. I have had to ask for it EVERYTIME I've been here. Today it consisted of a few grapes and 3 small slices of an orange. And not even cold just at room temperature. I think I'll find another place to have my weekend brunch."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Mimi's in some time and due to a negative experience in a restaurant across the lot we decided to give Mimi's a try again. We were greeted as we walked in and seated right away. Our server, Cheyene arrived soon after we were seated and was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She took our drink order and and returned quickly with the drinks. We placed our food order and they arrived quickly. I had a burger with an egg on it that was juicy and tasty. It was prepared just as I had requested. Having heard that it was my wife's birthday, our server made sure to provide a dessert for her. The little bistro feel of the place added to the experience. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A lady and I went to Mimi's after Church on Sunday (Sept 18,2016). Our waiter was Cory! He is super... at his job/sees everything quickly/has great insight constantly...he knows his job well/wants to do his best..  we could tell...  Sit at his table if you get the chance...we sat at the far table.. on the floor... in the bar area!  We want him every time,if possible! He asked if everything was good!  The manager came around and  asked how things were too...our coupon worked like it was supposed too...everything was terrific!!!!  Go there!!   :)  :)  :)  :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today.  The food was terrible, service was ok.  Will not go back, talked my sister and her husband to eat here!  Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat - I love their Salads and the muffins are awesome... my mom and I love to duck out to lunch without the guys to this little jewel - I have found that many of the men in my life are not fans of the food here.  But I love it - I have had several of the salads they are always fresh and a real variety of greens, soup is great and I loved the salmon.  Service has always been good -  From experience not everyone loves Mimi's but I do!"}
{"text":"We went to MiMi's in Goodyear on October 25th.  It was one of the WORST dinner experiences I have had.  We ordered the spinach dip and it arrived warm, but not hot.  chips were thick as if they were pita chips but they were tortilla.  Taste was also POOR  There were three of us for dinner.  All three of us had COLD mashed potatoes.  Warm butter would NOT melt on the potatoes.  I had requested mine to have the gravy on the side and they came out with gravy.  They returned them COLD.  I had the turkey.. it tasted as if it was not cooked thru and the stuffing was not edible.  The carrots were cold and the broccoli was the ONLY hot thing on my plate.  One of my quests had the chicken piccata with garlic mushrooms.  There was ONE small slice of CANNED Mushrooms in the sauce.. also this was not edible.  My other guest had asked for the chicken pot pie and they were out so he had the Cordon Bleu.  ALSO cold and had no flavor.  We all had the mini wedge salad and the tomato and bacon was chopped so fine and so little of it you could not taste it.  VERY DISSATISFIED with the dinner.  I worry that with the food coming out cold and not kept at the proper temp, we would get sick  I had severe diarrhea all night.  NOT A PLACE I WOULD RECOMMEND or EVER go back to.  The manager told me that all the food is prepared for them and they only reheat.  LOL something they cannot do apparently."}
{"text":"First, I have been a diner at Mimi's for many years at various locations..San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, and in Arizona. Have always enjoyed their varied menu, pricing, and service. Dined at unit on Tatum, Scottsdale on 10/19/13 where we encountered the new French format and service theme. I think company should have better tested the format at a couple of locations......my observation is that it is not going to be a hit.   MENU has had to much revamping to soon.  Complaints I overheard were that customer favoites were gone.  French headings for items are great if you read french. PRICES seem higher with extra charges for items that are included at other similar restaurants.. PRESENTATION-Did not quite understand why sides were served on separate plate and main entre (sole meuniere) was served on 2nd plate.  All would have fit on one plate and given a better presentation. SERVICE- Waitperson (Debby) provided excellent service. MISC. Waitpeople/staff now greet you with a few words of French (I understand they are now trained with a few common greetings in French.)  What happens if the customer responds to them in French...and the staff person has no clue what they said.....that could be funny.  Anyway, good luck with your new format.  I hope it is received well.  I have my doubts but,, hope I am wrong.  Don't want to see Mimi's go the way of Mervyn's, Sears, and Penny's."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly good! We felt very welcome. Our breakfast was amazing! I will be back and will recommend Mimis to others! Thank you for hosting our breakfast meeting!"}
{"text":"While wait service has always been quite good here it's an unevenness in good prep that keeps them from being stand-out.  Luckily on this visit the reason for our visit was the salmon & frites entree.  On this occasion the portion of salmon was both moist and perfectly cooked. Their salmon prep while not always perfect has remained more consistent than that of the BJ's Brewhouse down the street. It was as hoped for with the only thing missing is that Mimi's could provide malt vinegar on the side or an available option.  We brought our own to remedy that.  About 3 years ago Mimis ceased offering their salmon w/ citrus salad that was so good, offering it instead with a less successful spinach salad mix, not nearly as good.  It would be nice if that returned to their menu.      Our other entree was the steak & frites. The steak was cooked as ordered but was not one of their most tender we've had. There wasn't a lot of flavor to it despite the dollop of flavored butter on top, so some additional salt and just a dash of A-1 (which I normally don't use) were needed.  Still, the meal overall was reasonable, rendered better by our use of the Buy one-get one free coupon we were armed with.   We also took home a 4-pk of blueberry Muffins for the next day's breakfast, and those muffins are unfailingly a great treat.   We'll be back to Mimi's again but likely will stay away from their steak. They are not a steak house and I sometimes forget to account for that.  They do have several savory items on board the menu to fill up on, & that's something else you can say for Mimi's....we always leave full."}
{"text":"Went to Mimi's since we had a coupon for $5 off breakfast.  The service is nothing to write home about.  Server was extremely phony and kept trying to upsell us (she would not stop).  The food was alright - it was nothing out of the ordinary - the muffins were really good, though.  Interior was nicely decorated and music was dry, drab elevator music.  The waitress gave the incorrect amount of change back but I wasn't going to fight it.  We went to Mimi's about a year ago, as well, and the server decided they were going to tack on another dollar for tip to himself.  Will not be eating here again - I can get a better meal at a better price elsewhere.  Be aware of the servers trying to scam tips out of you!"}
{"text":"This place is not what I thought it would be. The service was not good at all the waitress practically threw our entrees at us. And the food was not delicious at all. We didn't even eat it we went right on to our next course. It tries to give an upscale vibe but it's totally a fake vibe. Do not eat here"}
{"text":"Excellent food - love the casual/business atmosphere.  I never had such incredible service.  There's something on the menu for everyone...unique breakfast, appetizers. incredible lunches, and wonderful satisfying dinners.  Mimi's does it right.  I'll  be back."}
{"text":"Worst place where you can eat!!! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Salmon. I've never seen such a bad looking Eggs Benedict and on the top of that there were egg shells in them. Completely disappointed. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Mimis Café and it couldn't have been better.  We came with friends who have eaten here several times in the past and always have good things to say about it. We both ordered French Onion Soup and the Skewer Garden Salad.  The skewers come with Shrimp or Scallops so I ordered one of each.  Both were very good.  Our friends ordered a Chicken Pot Pie and a Salmon dinner.  They both had nothing but good things to say about their meals.  We are always looking for new restaurants to try.  Some we can't wait to go back and some we hope to never see again.  This one's a keeper.  We'll be back soon and often."}
{"text":"We went to Mimis for lunch on Sunday afternoon. The host asks how many and I say 6, he looks around and sighs and says well it's going to be a wait. He tells me that they have two big parties coming in so we will have to wait for something to open up in the main dining area. My husband and I say okay and take a seat. As we look in the main dining room, we see about 3 empty booths and 4 tables empty.  We figured it would take a few minutes to push some tables together so we waited. After 20 minutes a waitress walks in looks at us and asks the host, are they still waiting? It wasn't said with concern but with sarcasm like she couldn't believe we were still there. We took the hint, got up and left. I think it's sad that they were willing to sacrifice a family of 6 because they had two large parties. We will never attempt to go there again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION!!!  WE were told 10 min wait and at 25 min decided to go elsewhere.  This location never has enough wait staff.  Today we observed a dining room with 1 server and maybe there was another server in back.  No manager to be seen. Since this has been a reoccurring experience for us at this location we will not be visiting this one in the future.     If you want a GREAT experience go to the location in Desert Ridge (101 & Tatum). They are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and the place was empty, yet it took 45 min to get the sandwich I ordered. I watched my waitress (Hiedi) sit at the bar and talk to the bartender. I will never go to the Goodyear Mimis again. Food was not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Service was great, annmarie was awesome..  Food on the other hand was not too good. Seemed like everything was microwaved. We used to come here all the time and have watched the place fall into a deeper hole every year."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been to a Mimi's Cafe. I think it's going to be a long time before I come back. Service was good but the portions, menu, and prices have taken a turn for the worst. Very small OJ to go along with the removal of muffins from the breakfast entrees mean way less for my money. They previously brought a pot for coffee I believe. It's just generally not as good as I remember. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Ordered one of their specialties, the meatloaf dinner...meatloaf was just OK but mashed potatoes weren't mashed at all, just a big hard lump that probably had been prepared hours in advance, spinach was very chewy, couldn't get it all down. I keep trying this place but this was the final time! Very few people in the place at dinner time...bad sign!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Mimi's Cafe for breakfast! My food always comes exactly how I want it (I'm one of those with custom this & that) & it's always HOT! Everything always tastes fresh. Scrambled eggs aren't all runny. Bacon isn't all fatty. Oatmeal is so yummy & filling. The serving staff is great & always on top of our needs. The only bad thing I can say is that they don't use real butter, but that's not a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ, great breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Muffins! Crab Cake Benedict is amazing, Chicken Parmesan is so good! It can get crowded!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is really good. I've never had a bad server and the atmosphere is relaxed. You don't have to strain to hear the person you're with talking."}
{"text":"Decent, servers are nice and quick for the most part. Don't ask for details on menu items because a few of them won't know. I got the breakfast there once and found plastic in my pancakes, but other than that there a nice little French style restaurant. They give you loads of food for the price. If you have but alert use though, I suggest you tell them right away because they give you bread with nuts in it as an appetizer. Overall, if you're in the mood for something hardy, I would go here for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for the artachoke dip and quiche Lorraine.  A little heavy on the salt for the dip.  They give you chips but I prefer bread with artichoke dip.  Never had the quiche Lorraine before.  Looks like a pie.  It's made of Swiss cheese and baby greens mainly.  Flavor was ok, liked the texture,  needs more greens in my opinion.  I believe they changed owners and the place is gone down in quality.  If you go ask for the giant    This yelper is a fan of , fruit, and veggies"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in Mimi's Cafe. I came here for a girl's brunch and was seated in an area that literally had no heat. Actually it was the coldest day in December and the a/c was on. When my friend and I said something they assured us the heat was going to be turned on. Meanwhile there were guests being seated on the \"heated\" side. After ordering our drinks and food it was apparent that the heat was never coming on and numerous guests were leaving and complaining. After my runny nose and frozen hands oh and cold food now I finally made my way to the front and asked to be moved. I even carried my own food and drinks to my new table. Horrible! No offer of a discount. No complimentary drink. No nothing. And one last thing....Mimi's why don't you think about cleaning your booths. #blacklight"}
{"text":"Very adequate cranberry-walnut-several types of lettuce salad & tuna salad half sandwiçh & DELICIOUS blueberry muffin.  Sorry internet service, which was a disappointment since phoned Cheesecake Factory (No WiFi!) & they recommended Mimi's & nearby Dave's Famous for fast internet. Seems fast, always-on internet a basic service all restaurants should invest in"}
{"text":"My mom and I frequent this location and I have to say that tonight the service was beyond superb! We had Miles as our server and never had to wait for anything. He immediately came over, got our order and was back with a minute with drinks, bread, and our soups. He refilled our drinks before they were gone. Our entrees came out as soon as we finished our soups. He went above and beyond to make sure our experience tonight was nothing short of the best. Good job Miles on providing amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I learned this morning that Mimi's uses \"processed\" eggs when making scrambled eggs. The server told me they were not real eggs, as I was lead to believe for the egg choices. The scrambled eggs, had a strange, spongy texture and a fake looking yellow color with very little taste. This is not the first time I have experienced this.  I have experienced this from other restaurants as well. The server told me the next time I order \"scrambled\" eggs to please ask for \"real\" eggs. She said the only assurance that it is a \"real\" egg is if you order eggs sunnyside up or over easy.  Do you think is  deceitful to the customer? I do. The manager came to our table and verified the eggs were not \"real.\"   I feel the customer has a right to know if they are eating \"real\" eggs or not.  A disclaimer should be posted on the menu to inform the customer about the substitution.  I am sure using \"processed\" eggs from a carton is a high profit item.  CUSTOMER BEWARE!  The reason I gave Mimi's 4 stars is because I like the atmosphere of the restaurant, the great attitudes of the servers and the quality of the food.  Their menu has great variety,  beautifully prepared food, and the prices are reasonable.  I will definitely go back there.  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for this morning's egg shocker."}
{"text":"I went to Mimi's for the first time for lunch, I don't know how it was years ago, but if this is the quality of the food now, I predict they will be closed SOON, just as Coco's went out out of business for poor service and food. Our waiter was great, but the food was overpriced for what I got. I ordered Mediterranean Salad. It was supposed to be olives, feta cheese and chicken on top of the large bed of greens. I got: two olives, and one really TINY piece of cheese. The mushy chicken had no flavor at all, and appeared to come out of a defrosted plastic bag. Not like the grilled strips one would find at other restaurants. My friend had ordered 'Jambalaya with pasta'. He said it did not taste good, and it appeared to be large chunks of canned tomato, cooked onion and little pieces of unidentified meat. It was on the \"special' blackboard which did not say what was in the dish. There was no garlic or flavor. He returned it to the waiter and got a refund with no problem. The place reminded me of Marie Callanders, except not as good, and Marie's is gone!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Got eggs benedict. Hollandaise was separated and had the consistency of curdled yogurt. Huge eggshell in the \"poached\" egg. It was a solid boiled egg. Will not return. Cynthia, water, was very sweet and efficient.  She saw that half my plate was unfinished and didn't care to ask why."}
{"text":"Mimi has lost it's charm the food is not as good as it once was and the servers shall we say can no longer understand a simple request. I will try another location before I write it's off completely."}
{"text":"We'll  this evening  my mom and I ate ..waitress gives me cold cup of coffee  .plus it was old and stale. ..mom ordered  the  corn  chowder  and it was ice cold...she ordered the rueben sandwich  omg!..1 slice of  imitation  processed corned beef! !...  and since they were short on corned beef added turkey Had more cold slaw  than  meat!..I ordered  the grilled salmon...and au gratin potatoes were cold....since my mom  does not  like  to send or complain..gladly  ripped them a new asshole. ..now I hope  everyone  knows that Darden  restaurant's  who own. Mimis. .Red lobster. .Chili's. .Apple bee's  and Dennys  restaurants. ..they use micrwaves to cook everything. ..it's  all portioned  out zapped  to infinity. .Unfortunately  what we got was a reflection  of lousy food and a ding bat of a waitress  that is not on her  game...this is the last time I will eat here.. oh yes the  bread basket  of carrot  mandolines...usually  they warm...nope ice cold! I guess there were rationing the  piped  butter  for  the  basket  And for God's  sake when the waitress introduces  herself...to you sais  bonjour ...phonetics  is a poor reflection  of  mimis. ..maybe  change  the name to loove....means Le' toilet...food  is  mediocre! ..service  enough to wipe  your ass without  breaking the skin!...and you bastardize  French  cuisine... to Americana"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  We appreciated being able to get away from the Marriott resort across the road too. Mimi's food is affordable in comparison and as good if not better in quality. Love the French ambience too."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast,  I had the eggs benidict, eggs close to raw holindase was just bland and tasted like it came out of a can. I guess you can get a bad meal now and again but this was worse than bad."}
{"text":"Two stars just to be polite. So it starts with being served with a cup of very poor coffee in a coffee cup with lipstick on it. Raw dough quiche. Onions are not supposed to make up 70% of a taco. Kids liked the pancakes. Oh and to my waitress. I am sorry you are here. It's obvious that you do not want to be there. It's ok. I understand. Highly recommend that no one goes here. Reduced to one star cause we never got our waters."}
{"text":"I have Mimi's at least once a week, and I cannot get enough of their mac and cheese, although their salads are also delicious. The portions are  large, and come with a delicious fresh muffin, so I always have left overs for dinner. Highly recommend it this place;  the staff is super nice and quick service."}
{"text":"Took a few minutes for the hostess to seat the two groups in front of me, which means that I stood there for way too long. Annoying. Strike one. Not that it matters, but the waitresses all look like they're wearing the same ill-fitting, grungy jeans and white dress shirts that look like they were borrowed from dad. Apparently they don't serve Eggs Benedict after 11:00 am. They tell me that everything else on the breakfast menu is available, just not the one thing I was craving. Strike two. I should have left immediately. They served me coffee that was barely warm. Strike three! But I had already ordered before I noticed the coffee or I would left. The waitress saw me waving at her and replaced my coffee pretty quickly. Much better. I guess I'll stay and see about the sandwich I ordered since they won't serve what I came here for. The roasted turkey and Brie sandwich was extremely dry! Almost inedible. I had take a big swig of coffee between every bite or I wouldn't have been able to eat it at all. Someone who must have been the manager asked how everything was. I wasn't going to lie, so I told him. He was nice enough about it, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are under 35 years old they basically ignore you completely because they think they won't tip. We come here frequently and that has been the common theme. Food is good but service is horrible if you are young. Today we got apple juice that was basically completely watered down to the point you could not even taste it, and have yet to be checked on for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I would like to preface this review by stating that I am a server, so I know how service SHOULD be, I'm not just some crazy person who thinks things like waiting 10 min for a well done steak is \"absurd\"  I came here for breakfast this morning at around 11:20. I managed to get a seat right away in the self seating area just to the left of the hostess stand. My server, Brittney, greeted me immediately and got my drink order. But then I had to wait a good 5 min for my coffee and water, and never got a spoon for my coffee (not a big deal but I don't like having to stir my coffee with a steak knife). By then I was ready to order, so I placed my order and waited. Someone else brought me my bloody Mary and offered me more coffee, but never brought me any. After about 10 min of having and empty cup and not seeing my server I finally asked the busser for some. A few min later my food was delivered by the same girl who delivered my bloody Mary and she finally brought me coffee. I asked her for a spoon and mentioned that I still hadn't received my juice. She said \"ok\" and left and didn't return. I didn't see my server again until I was 95% done with my meal (an omelet which was bland and in a pool of some kind of liquid on my plate - maybe tomato juices?)  and again asked for a spoon and more coffee. A few min later I got a spoon but didn't get more coffee for about 7 min. All in all this whole dining experience took an hour, which is pretty ridiculous for 1 person to get an omelet.  (I wrote this in March 2012 and just saw that it never posted. Oops!)"}
{"text":"Breakfast platters didnt make sense with potatoes only as a side. .99c for anything else.  The quiche is basically scrambled eggs In a pie crust. Not impressed."}
{"text":"While this place serves savory beef dishes, rich mashed potatoes, and creamy corn chowder,  the thing I can't get past is that not only are the side dishes equal to the size of the entree, the side is either a heaping pile of steamed vegetable that comes without sauce or seasoning, or  it's a salad that's been tainted with a cheap-o vinagrette.  If I do decide to go back to Mimi's it will only be because I'm craving meatloaf and I'm low on options."}
{"text":"Went the Friday after Thanksgiving dinner with Las Vegas relatives.  Since we were still stuffed from the day before, we had the two course meal (corn soup was fabulous) and I had chicken fried steak.... two palm-sized pieces with a gob of mashed potatoes and a spoonful of boiled carrots and cauliflower.  A tad salty for my palate but reasonably priced meal for value.  Nice homey feel with attentive service.  Would go again.  The $13.99 3 course meals seem to be a real bargain but we had a dessert back at the house to get to."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Mimi's. Not sure why I continue to eat there other than I have a friend who likes to go there. Anyway, ate lunch there today. Ordered the petite salmon salad. It was good, but definitely not worth the $9.49 price tag. There couldn't have been more than 2 oz. of salmon. That and a small amount of salad. Frankly, it's daylight robbery and I wouldn't order it again. With this particular meal, you don't even get a muffin! Also, the service is never stellar. It wouldn't take a whole lot on their part to improve things. Oh, well, live and learn."}
{"text":"HERS: We stopped here on a family lunch date. We had a party of 6. The bread came out 20 minutes after we sat down and ordered. Our waitress kept forgetting our drinks. When she brought the waters she spilled the water all over my moms chair, my mother was in the restroom at the the time, she didn't even flinch at the sight of her spilling the water everywhere and never cleaned it up! My mom ended up just taking  the chair from the table behind her. When our appetizer came out--which was the artichoke dip it came with hardly any chips. We wanted some more chips, and our waitress seemed less than interested in checking up so I had to get up and ask her for more. Our table was never checked up on, we didn't get asked if we needed anything and HIS water never came out. ALSO the female manager who was on site kept looking badly at our 4 year old when our 4 year old got upset for a brief moment. Our little girl wasn't loud and we took her to the bathroom right away to settle down. When my food came out it was okay. Nothing special. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"great atmosphere and service love the food and kid friendly love the prep dirt cup deserts my kids actually thought there were actual worms lol but it's a great place and great food at a great price!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good home cooked meal. Coupon get emailed alowing one meal free with purchase of one meal. What a great value. Always great service."}
{"text":"Was vacationing in AZ last week and stopped at Mimis near our hotel.  Had never been to a Mimis before, but I was not overly impressed with the food.  Had a nice appetizer (homemade guac with chips).  Fresh lime juice was added at the table. Both entrees came with \"frites\" or french fries, and they were soggy and greasy for both entrees.  Our roasted chicken and steak with peppercorn sauce were OK, not great.  Got a free piece of crepe cake at the end of the meal.  It was covered with loads of brightly colorful sprinkles, but it actually tasted very good.  I would order the cake again, but not a meal with their frites.  Service was pretty good after we waited about 30 minutes for a table on a Friday night."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH! Don't waist your money. A totally tasteless Santa Fee omelette for $10.49 with a half a teaspoon of guacamole and super HOT sauce that burned my mouth. Took one bite and sent it back for two scrambled eggs that were undercooked...didn't eat them either. I decided against the $3.65 glass of orange juice replacing it with an overpriced cup of coffee. My blueberry muffin was excellent. The friend I ate with got the breakfast egg tacos for $10.99 with the same HOT sauce and was sweating half way through the meal.  It upset his stomach for the rest of the day. Our waitress was very nice as was the manager who came over to talk to me about my omelette. The scrambled eggs were her idea. I actually would have been happy with just another muffin as it was the only item on the menu that I trusted at this point.  BTW, I don't appreciate it when any establishment pushes alcohol. There was a bottle of wine on our table (for breakfast) and we were asked right up front if we wanted to start off with a Mimosa. This place needs to do the public a favor and close their doors! It is sad because this used to be such a great place to eat. I feel sorry for the nice people that work there. The upper management/corporate fools who are now running this chain should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"see review above...i just joined yelp and accidentally posted twice.  vz"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in eating here. It had been 2 years or so since dining at this restaurant because it's not close to our home but since we were in the area we decided to give it a go. Our previous experiences were pleasant. It was 630 on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was slow. The first table we were sat at had a huge rip in the booth. We moved to a table because we needed a high chair and a table was easier to accommodate the high chair. We were sat right beside the kitchen. We noticed on our walk in how dirty the floors were, with trash under booths and on the floor. The kitchen area we could see was no different. There was water on the floor and at one time a server slipped but didn't make an attempt to clean the water. Our server was great; no issues there. I had to get up to use the bathroom. The other sitting area was very dirty; trash under empty tables and on the floor and crumbs all over the carpet. I passed the rest of the kitchen and it was a filthy mess. The bathrooms were no exception. There were very limited supplies. No toilet paper in a couple stalls. Paper towels short supply . Messy stalls with trash all over and dirty toilets. I was very shocked at the filth of this place since last time we were there it was clean. On to the food. My husband ordered chicken pot pie and I ordered the sourdough burger. His pot pie was very watery not thick like expected. My burger was average; cooked correctly and decent flavor. What was disappointing was the fries. They were soggy and greasy. I asked for a new order and still they were greasy and soggy. They were hot just not crispy which means the oil wasn't hot enough and possibly old. It was a huge disappointment since I really wanted the fries. We probably won't return and I foresee this establishment not surviving much longer."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday morning & Mimi's was PACKED! We walked in, gave the hostess our name & told the wait wouldn't be too long considering it was just the two of us. The décor was French quarter New Orleans-themed, with Parisian style knick knacks & art work abound. A bit on the kitchy side, but quite nifty IMO! What I found to be not only impressive but wise was that they had free coffee, mini muffins & sample size nut loafs for the waiting patrons, which mostly consisted of seniors & families.   Following the hostess to our table, I couldn't help but notice, the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes.   The menu had so many mouth watering choices, but considering I was feeling ill, I ordered a bowl of granola & a (YU-MMY) buttermilk spice muffin. Boring I know, but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish, the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, bacon & asiago cream sauce, accompanied by red potatoes, choice of one of their mega-sized (hot & fresh) muffins & fresh squeezed O.J.   The service was on the slow side, perhaps understaffed or just overwhelmed, but our waiter made it up to us by giving me choice of beverage & extra muffins, no charge.   For those of you who want healthier options, don't you fret, they offer a Fresh & Fit menu as well.   All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience @ this Mimi's location & will definitely return if I'm ever back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Slow service!  Crunchy pancakes?  What happened mimis? Used to be good.  They also recently changed their menu, with my favorite sandwich gone!  Never again."}
{"text":"We go to Mimi's for the change of pace .  We had the fried zucchini and artichoke dip for apps. Fried zucchini had a light batter , with a spinkle of parm cheese it was good , but it did not come with a sauce or dip at least a ranch dressing would b good.  The spinach /artichoke dip was tasty it came with some toasted bread.  The bread basket is always a hit especially the carrot bread .            I had the chicken artichoke pasta with a creamy marinara it came with a breaded chix breast , it was a little dry .           The pasta had a lot of artichokes maybe too much especially if u use the canned ones it has that pickled / briney taste. That might be alright in a salad or a anti pasta dish not a pasta dish.  Mimi's is a nice change of pace for us ."}
{"text":"Decent food, atrocious service! For some reason, my kids love this place!  So, we eat here or order take out when they insist on it.  Unfortunately, the food quality is just not good enough to put up with the lousy service. Here's what we experienced on our last 3 visits: 1 - being seated for 15 min before even being acknowledged by our server, ordering drinks and waiting another 20min, 2 of 5 orders were wrong and efforts to correct the deficiencies were ignored 2 - similar to #1 on a different occasion, asking for salad dressing 2x and never receiving it (I had to go get it myself), asking for water refills multiple times, extremely inattentive server (as usual) 3 - ordering curbside takeout only to have to go inside to get order after sitting in car for 15 min (I did curbside b/c I had an ill child and didn't want to expose anyone in the restaurant), when I got inside the order was wrong and took forever to fix (overall checkout for a to go order was 30+ min) With so many wonderful restaurants in the Scottsdale area, do not waste your time or money on this one!"}
{"text":"My family used the Winery room at Mimi's to hold a reception following a funeral.  Megan was very easy to work with and gave us plenty of food selections, the food was great and the service was excellent.  This is the second time I have used them to hold luncheons and I will definitely use again.  Prices fare also very reasonable and they can accommodate all eaters."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, decent prices and quantity. I had the patty melt, cooked med, it was cooked perfectly, the only prob was the rye bread was not grilled with butter, but toasted. The bread was dried out pretty good and almost like a crouton on the edges. Ceasar salad had good dressing, the fries were surprisingly good. One thing you can't miss is the dessert sampler trio for $4.99! I don't usually have dessert, but this was really good. You get a small dish of apple crisp, bread pudding, and a brownie with ice cream! My wife and shared it and it was enough for the two of us. Very tasty! Can't go wrong here. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We went on Valentines Day for lunch and had a coupon which said it was not good on holidays. I didn't consider Valentines Day a '\"holiday\"  such as Xmas or July 4th. The manager was very nice about the coupon and honored it with no problem. This is comfort food that is pretty good."}
{"text":"Well I new better to come in on a Sunday 45 minutes to be seated, 20 more then we were told, another 45 to get our food plus they never brought the whole meal and no one asked how we were doing. Bottom line it was not worth 2 hours of my life"}
{"text":"Mimi's in general is consistently going downhill.  No matter what location, the service is sub par. Coffee?  Can't even wave someone over for a refill.  Muffins are a specialty, but 9 am in a Sunday they are explaining that they really haven't baked everything yet & didn't have what's in the menu. Pancakes were dry & chewy & my husbands croissant breakfast sandwich could hardly be cut & the cheese was just congealed over the egg like it had just been thrown in a microwave. Over the past 4 years I don't know if ownership or management has changed. The menu definitely has. The only reason we come in occasion is because someone from another state gave us 2 large gif cards. When those are yo, so is Mimi's. A shame really."}
{"text":"Nice place, but the food is lacking. I tried the Santa Fe omelet and found it to be not very spicy. The service was good and I will go there again because it is close to where I live. However, I would like a little more flavor..."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and frites. They were out. I went with the Fish and Chips. It was average not bad and not great great. It would've been super if it were fresh. Waiter acted like I had leprosy. Oh well that's how this goes. It'll be a while before going back."}
{"text":"The menu is a spin on classic dishes but it misses the mark. My friend and I had omelettes that were bland. I will not return because the food is sub par."}
{"text":"Great service from the moment we stepped I in the door for dinner. Very attentive. Delicious food! We split the Brie appetizer, I had the famous onion soup and hubby loved the burger with the bacon and fried egg on it. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy Mimi's but then they changed the menu.  No more Albacore and Avacado sandwich..  :(  Had the streak salad instead and it was a disaster.  Who puts deep fried cheese balls on a salad?  They do now.  Service was also one step behind Denny's.    Another restraunt who switched from good food to cheap food and kept the prices high."}
{"text":"I usually do not write reviews, but I had to describe my experience on June 1st at the Desert Ridge location. My husband, 2 small children and I were driving around Desert Ridge looking for a breakfast restaurant when I spotted Mimi's. I yelled, YES!! Mimi's-we have to go. It took about 15 minutes to be addressed by the server after we were seated at which point she spilled a tray full of water all over and inside of my purse. She apologized and got me some napkins but several items were drenched, she said--it's just water. After ordering, a manager came around and asked if we needed anything and I said yes, we want to add a side of bacon to our order. She said, well I have no idea who your server is so just order it from her when she comes back around. I said, well she does not come around much. The lady said, yes just go ahead and tell her when she comes back. I thought--why did you ask if you didn't truly want to help? Aside from this, I was so excited to get the quiche I love so much at Mimi's. When our food arrived we were SO disappointed. My daughters scrambled eggs were grey in color and clearly had been microwaved. My quiche was cold and rubbery, nothing like the fresh warm quiche I am used to. I ate maybe half of it. Instead of a side of fruit, I got 2 old pieces of melon. We spent almost $60 for food that was less quality than a Denny's and we gave the meal and service a 4, which I consider generous. I have been a long time Mimi's customer and I was so sad the quality and service have declined so much."}
{"text":"Mimi's cafe is the closest thing we have here to a typical NY diner.  There is a wide selection of food and everything is very flavorful.  There is a French/Cajun atmosphere to the restaurant, but don't worry, the menu isn't laden with crawfish and jambalaya.  My favorites are the Corn Chowder, the Liver and Onions (ask for the pot roast gravy on the side with it), Eggs, sunny side up with the breakfast potatoes.  Their coffee is alright too.  Other recommendations include the Filet of Sole and the Parmesan crusted Chicken.  This is a family restaurant, so don't be afraid to bring the kids.  Their burgers are great too."}
{"text":"This place is nice and calm. I had grill cheese and tomato soup. It was good, but I've had better. I prefer Panera Bread's tomato soup better. But my cousin got grilled chicken and fries and that was delish!"}
{"text":"Good food, service was good & dinning area is kept clean. Their restrooms were a bit messy but their good food makes up for it! Try the devil egg appetizer! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu.  Great service.  My wife and I became Sunday morning regulars.  We love the lunch/dinner menu but breakfast at Mimi's is one of the all time best.  We have tried virtually every item on the breakfast menu with no complaints at all.  My favorite is the eggs benedict.  The mix and match of the sides makes it east to create a new mean every Sunday.  Highest recommendations."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late breakfast. We had a 10 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon. When we walked in, they had a little kiosk of complimentary coffee, fruit punch, and baked goods for those of us waiting in the lobby.  Very busy...not one empty table in the room...yet they remained very attentive and super friendly. They even had an employee whose purpose was to greet people at their tables while they wait and check on the patrons every once in a while throughout their meals...very sweet lady.  I ordered the Belgian Waffles with sausage and eggs....pretty good. My son was happy with his short stack order.   Mimi's is one of the better chain restaurants in my book!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Hostess sat us at a dirty table. Asked her to clean it, she said she would. Next she came back with napkins & silverware & placed them on the dirty table. Again I asked if our table could be cleaned & hostess said they should be over soon to clean it as she asked \"them\" to take care of it. Minutes pass... table is still dirty. Finally waitress shows up. Starts in on her greeting & I interrupt her to ask if our table could please be cleaned & informed her we asked the hostess & it was not done. She left to get us water & a man came and cleaned the table. Waitress returned & we placed our order. My daughter & I both ordered a turkey club with no tomatoes. My mom ordered a tuna melt. When our food arrived at the table all I could see was the tomatoes on our sandwiches!!! I made a comment about seeing the tomatoes & the waitress grabbed out plates up & said she'd take care of it... uh, seriously??? I already knew what that meant it meant she'd take it in the back the tomatoes would be removed & then they would be brought right back to us. Sure enough a few minutes later the waitress returned with our disheveled sandwiches that had been manhandled to remove the tomatoes. THIS IS NOT TAKING CARE OF IT!!! I don't like tomatoes period!!! Therefore I do not want the tomato juice & seeds left behind on my sandwich!!! I'm paying you for a service & would like the food made to my order specifications. It's not like I was asking for anything special or difficult. Simply leave off the tomatoes!!! Heck it is even saving you money. I'm still paying the same menu price for the item. Overall a horrible experience. Waitress seemed oblivious to how irritated I was. My mom actually loves this restaurant & was surprised at the poor service we received!"}
{"text":"Brunch is always delicious which keeps us returning. Service is sub par. Servers never try to make a connection. The only reason why I'm giving a high rating still is because of the food and the management. They actually care about your experience and do more than the servers do. I have to say the manager this morning 11/9/14 was fantastic and handled a very unpleasant start of service and made it much better. Kudos."}
{"text":"Decent ........Always Decent .......... Predictably Decent  Mimi's is not pretentious ......  What a rarity .......  ...... and you can hear your Table-mates, nice decibel levels .... NO FOOLING !!!  Our Sunday Morning Breakfast, came off, without a hitch. Great Food ..... Great Service ....  My Ethics .... My Standards: Every business starts with one star ...... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED."}
{"text":"Mimi's was disgustingly dirty. Had we noticed all of the dirt and slime dripping down the wall prior to eating we would've left. After waiting at the hostess stand for 10 minutes we sat ourselves a waitress approached me finally and with attitude and said we couldn't do that. We took multiple pictures of the caked on dirt on the vents, food splattered on the ceiling in the kitchen, syrup or some substance dripping down the wall in the booth. A call to the health department is in order if they can't take the time to clean it's not likely they are cleaning the area in which they are cooking our food or if the people are washing their hands before handling our food."}
{"text":"Can't believe it. Worst service I have ever had. 40 minutes to order after we were seated, 35 minutes to get our food and I had to get up and get our own refills. They brought them out on a tray and left them at another table for 15 minutes.   My wife and I come here a lot and over the last 2 months it has really been going down hill.   When we finally got it food it was cold.   There must be less than 5 tables occupied, they were not busy.   I'm not coming back and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed yet at this Mimi's. I have not had to wait longer than 5 minutes to be seated, and the hostess is always very friendly. The menu is very diverse, but it is a bit annoying that some items do not have their price listed (i.e. coffee drinks). It's a small thing to be irritated about, but I was kind of surprised that a cup of regular coffee was $3.29. The service has been great! My family and I have not felt rushed, and our waiter or waitress is quick to take our order and bring refills. I like that the manager walks around to check on each table. The food itself is pretty decent. They have these buy one get one deals that make the price worth it; otherwise, I think it's a bit expensive for a family. I usually get the skewers - you get two seafood skewers (salmon, scallops, or shrimp), ratatouille, salad, and some flatbread. Their birthday crepe cake is also very good! Sometimes they have deals on their receipts if you complete a survey (we got a free birthday cake after completing the survey on our latest receipt). Before your food is brought out, they offer you a complimentary bread basket. I love the madeleines! For a quick breakfast item, the almond croissants are delicious! They have an almond paste in them that is just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"the thing that stunned me was the hostess. She was not at all happy, and when she seated us, i saw a delicious soup someone next to us was having and i asked her \"omg what is that soup it looks good???\" and she looked at me like i was dumb and said, \"....i dont know\" and walked away...it was ridiculous....my gf that i was with is a hostess and she was in disbelief too....she could have said, \"I'm not sure, ill ask your waitress to find out, or i will find out for you\" but \"...i dont know\" with an attitude? very dissapointing especially being the FIRST impression that we have when we walk in.... very bad customer perception.     Besides that, The food was awesome, and my waitress was awesome...but very dissapointing on the hostess end...first impressions are everything."}
{"text":"Was very skeptical about eating here due to the yelp reviews . The place was very empty at the time for 4:00 pm . I was very satisfied with the service from our waiter Jason . He was very attentive and courteous . The food  was very tasty, fresh , and bread was warm out of the oven. I'm glad I did not listen to the previous reviews because service was great. Will definitely be back when visiting Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Mimi's Cafe at this location several times. While we've had several adequate experiences we have never had a poor experience with the exception of our most recent visit. I will describe in detail below, but the short version is we will not come back to this location. 1. Our waitress Cheryl was friendly and took our drink order; two sodas, 1 alcoholic beverage and 1 expresso. the expressso took 10 minutes to arrive and was cold. 2. The food took at least 30 minutes to arrive at our table. The eggs benedict and the crab benedict were hot, but both of the potatoes were cold. The portions of both were small and did not match the price we paid for both. The side of fruit we ordered was also small and the quality of the fruit was not worth the price charged for it. 3. We got refills of our sodas after we had finished our entrees and was about to ask for the check. 4. The woman's restroom was absolutely freezing, to the point that the faucets were ice cold to the touch. Compared to other establishments at their price point, their quality, customer service and value are poor at best. We paid over $50 for a breakfast for two, it was worth half that."}
{"text":"This place deserves the name of \"Land of Nod\"! The stuff is very slow and sluggish, especially during the nights. We took Mushroom and Brie burger with fries and Quiche Lorraine. I should say that we were waiting for our order for more than 40 minutes! When we finally got our meals, the fries were completely burnt! The Quiche tasted as it was warmed-over at least 3 times! When we called the waitress she rudely replied that it's how it should be. I would give this place no more than 1 star but their desserts saved the situation!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Took our family of 4 out for a special treat. Over priced nasty food. Steak dinners were awful.  Hamburger was raw. Worst service ever. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped it to Mimi's for a early lunch/late breakfast. We seated right away in a busy dining room. Service was great, however there was clearly a huge back up in the kitchen. Almost every table was waiting for their food to arrive. We waited almost 30 minutes for our food to come out. Had to send my eggs back because they came \"over hard\" instead of \"over easy\" like I ordered them. After another 10 minutes, new eggs were delivered cooked in so much grease, they were yellow. I noticed the manager came out for less than 2 minutes to fill water for 1 customer and then was never seen again.  Find a different place to eat. Our food sucked!"}
{"text":"First night in Henderson, by sheer chance, we found ourselves at this wonderful local gem. We were seated immediately, with a smile. Ur server, Shannon was at our table in short order, explained the menu, and took our wine order.   Wine (very good, very reasonable) and excellent breads arrived immediately.   We split a Caesar salad, which was perfect. Both of us had the meatloaf special, mine with fresh green beans, my wife's with sautéed fresh spinach. Entrees were excellent, and portions were generous.   We totally enjoyed our meal at Mimi's. Shannon was friendly, prompt with our orders, and exhibited that elusive balance of being attentive without bugging us.   Highly recommended, and request Shannon's section."}
{"text":"I love Mimi's, and I love this location. My mom and step-dad go here at least once a week (usually for breakfast) and I got with my mom at least once a month. I am a HUGE fan of the broccoli and cheddar omelet (although they no longer have it on the menu, they still make it if you ask) and I love trying all of the seasonal items they offer. In the last month I tried the cinnamon brioche french toast (excellent) and the lemon poppy seed pancakes (pretty good but not great) as well as the new chocolate mousse muffin (to DIE for). I have never had a bad meal here, but obviously I have liked some things way more than others. The coffee is yummy and the apple juice is good too.   Service is, 9 times out of 10, great. The manager serves one day a week, every week, and I love when we get sat at one of her tables. Sometimes you get the server who is slow to refill drinks and bring the bill, but that can happen anywhere.  Also, sign up for their email club. We get coupons all the time. Buy one entree get one half off, get one free, that kind of thing."}
{"text":"Poor service, mediocre food, over priced.  Go to IHOP instead."}
{"text":"We had an hour to eat, which should've been doable. We ordered right away just to make sure. Ten minutes later, another couple was seated at the next table. I don't know when they ordered, but they received their meals ahead of us. Our first clue that there might be an issue was when our waiter told us that our meals were coming up. After some time passed, he again came over to tell us our food was coming up. When I gave him a confused look, he explained that the salmon was taking longer.  Seriously? I told him that salmon does not take this long to grill. When we finally received our food, I had a sliver of salmon and a truly ordinary handful of salad...for $12.99. But my husband's meal was worse...a \"ribeye\" steak that was 1/4\" thick and barely cooked (he ordered medium) and mashed potatoes that looked like they came from my first grade jar of paste. My husband was too nice to say anything and I care about him enough not to embarrass him. For all those reasons, we won't go back. We're better off going to a locally owned place...generally better food for the money and better service to boot."}
{"text":"I went in to get some dinner with my sister , the server was awesome, we ordered some chicken tenders some for me and her , not only did the food take forever , mind you that it was dead in there, not busy at all, 40 minutes later we got our food, bit into the chicken just to find out it was completely RAW, BOTH OF OUR PLATES OF CHICKEN were raw. it was disgusting. the manager came to our table just to say sorry and take the plates out of our way, he took the chicken tenders off the bill, but couldn't even comp the drinks, what a waste of 40 minutes to not even eat. I work at a restaurant and my mangers always make sure to make the guest feel comfortable and satisfied , but here that was not the case the manager didn't even care that the chicken was raw."}
{"text":"First timer at Mimi's Cafe. I was extremely hungry.. The service was alright but the time bring out the food was too long. It's okay... Solid 3.5 .."}
{"text":"So, I like the food at Mimi's- but the service is a whole other story. I went there for breakfast with some old friends yesterday, and I've never been so frustrated in my whole life. Well maybe, but at the time, I was about to lose my mind. First off, the waitress took forever to even come take our drink orders, let alone our meal orders. And she was not friendly. Second off, the food took about 40 minutes, which was ridiculous. Never got an apology. Third off, I ordered a smoothie and she didn't bring it out. Asked her for it 2 or 3 times, and when I finally got it I was already done with the rest of my food and didn't want it. My friend never received her tea and was still charged for it. Fourth off, we asked for separate checks and I think it took her a solid three times to get it right. Fifth off, she never said SORRY for anything. Thank goodness they have good muffins, because that is the ONLY thing that will keep me coming back.."}
{"text":"Here after our grandsons football game on  Saturday morning. Wait was way too long, unfriendly, and service was the worst!  I have been to Mimi's several times in Santa Clarita and enjoyed it. I hope the food is worth the wait. Would not come back or recommend it"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the holiday music was so nice, our server, Kearney was fantastic!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the worst staff experiences I have ever witnessed. An elderly couple politely asked about the meal special they had heard about on Channel 3. The reason for their visit this evening, the waitress impatiently responding that there are NO veterans discounts on memorial day and would be happy to get a manager to reiterate her point. The manager did come to the table again with an impatient attitude saying he knew of no such promotion, etc... After the staff stood in back loudly making fun of the elderly couple for around ten minutes he came back to clarify that after some \"research\" there was in fact no promotion. The confused couple left after paying their bill only again to be mocked as they walked out the door....  If you are a veteran, have respect for one or god bless had the pleasure to know a fallen soldier I would suggest never visiting this establishment!"}
{"text":"Eh! I've been here so many times. And each time I go (mostly cuz the person I'm with wanted to eat here) I always leave thinking \"that was blah\". I always tell myself I won't go back. But I guess I might end up going anyway. Nothing special at all and the food used to be suuupppperr salty! Then it was super flavorless."}
{"text":"I think the exact location is pretty poor. While it is located in a big shopping center on Rainbow and 215, it is all the way in the back of the center, along with Chili's and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. I imagine if it were more visible along the street, it'd be more popular.  Anyway, this place is good for all day long breakfast served. I usually get the mixed berry pain perdu and haven't been disappointed. Some servers seem to favor the older patrons.  Not really a place for those looking for a young, hip environment but for a safe bet place with decent food, it's ok."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is really good, as well as the service and atmosphere. I really enjoy getting breakfast here, even in the evenings. I have a few favorite dishes, the quiche is really good, as well as the waffles and french toast, but my all time favorite is the cajon chicken sausage that comes with eggs, country potatoes and your choice of toast or muffin. I noticed recently that they took the cajon chicken sausage off the menu which really freaked me out at first, but they still make it, they just don't display it on the menu anymore for some reason."}
{"text":"I love love love the food here but I only gave it four stars because I don't like the new changes...... Prices have gone up and they have skimped down on thier kids menu.  They totally eliminated the kids \"dirt cup\"  which my kids LOVED and was the only reason they were always wanting to go there."}
{"text":"We go 1 or 2 times per year and the meals and service are decent but prices have gone up significantly the last couple years. I can get the same or better meal for less $$."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every weekend for Sunday brunch. Love the sourdough bread."}
{"text":"Here for breakfast, ordered standard two eggs over medium with ham. I wanted hash browns but it's not available instead they'll over roasted red potatoes.  Big disappointment, the potatoes were hit and miss. All were not fresh some over cook some almost raw, but none appealing. Now my over medium eggs were runny and not over medium. Ham was good. One other thing, the table top was sticky."}
{"text":"BEWARE!  Possibility of Salmonella here!!  Went there looking forward to having a nice breakfast and was so disgusted being given raw eggs...TWICE!!  Ordered the Sante Fe wrap, and it was flavorless, soggy, gritty, and runny due to the eggs not being scrambled properly.  The service was the slowest I have ever had, 20 minutes to get our order in, 30 minutes to get bad food.  The waitress was accommodating but not great, and at least replaced the wrap with scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes.  But again, the eggs were raw!!  I could clearly see an area of runny raw egg whites on both different orders.  It's clear that they just got some cook off the street, versus an actual chef.  If I wanted street cook food, I would have gone to a cheaper place, expecting bad food.  How dare this Mimi's consider themselves a restaurant.  Overall the experience of eating there was the worst in my life.  Another table also returned their food, so it wasn't just me.  Expecting to get a scaled up version of fast food, I got worst.  I will never go to this place, and if I get stuck there looking for a place to eat in this area....I will go next door to Burger King first!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, both times it was on an off day/time with no wait time. Servers have been attentive and kind. Ordered the same soup/salad/sandwich which was enough to share between two people. The first time the grilled cheese was better prepared as well as the soup. Won't be rushing back here, but may try it again if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"\" Would you like more butter with that?\" Those were the actual words that melted my heart, never having heard a server ask me this in my entire restaurant-going life. 5 stars for that . Still, amazingly enough my answer was no, because this is the kind of place that provides a generous number of salted butter pats with the indulgent chocolate mousse muffin. I have had breakfast here twice and love the over-the-top muffin with breakfast deal here. It's like two breakfasts in one - a large desert-style muffins with the bacon, breakfast potatos and eggs thing.  Does anyone really need it? Of course not. I kept chanting under my breath, I am not going to eat this whole sticky, frosted muffin...until it was gone.  And who can resist the totally wholesome servers who, without a trace of irony, greet you with a perky \"Bonjour!\" Although this is listed as an \"American\" restaurant, they definitely are trying for some kind of French thing, what with brioche and all. Hard to beat for a breakfast that lasts all day, when you can't decide to go sweet or savory and friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"Poorly understaffed don't plan on a quick lunch I got my food the same time as the gal who walked in 20 min after me I was sitting at bar and can equate this to a fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my girlfriend here. It was a nice day so we sat outside, they have a nice little patio area. My sandwich was ok, my friend says they have great breakfasts.  Ill have to come back and try again."}
{"text":"Zero stars! My wife and I used to go to Mimi's frequently but stopped going a while back due to some bad experiences with argumentative service and poor food quality. We recently got an email coupon for a french dip at a great price and decided to give them another try. When we started to order, we were informed that they were out. The manager offered to replace the roast beef with turkey, which wouldn't have been much of a french dip at that point. We told him how disappointed we were. He had lots of excuses but proposed no solutions. We walked out and will not ever go back. They were unprepared for their advertised special. The manager told us that they had served 90 sandwiches at lunch. It seems to me that with a chain restaurant and a mass email campaign, they should have expected high numbers of customers and had plenty of supplies.They did not go to any effort to keep us as customers and let us walk. The manager also told us that other customers had walked out disappointed as well. This should be a wake up call to Mimi's corporate. REALLY DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"I usually never give a bad review BUT this really made me angry. I worked a full shift and then some on Christmas Eve, I was tired, hungry, and so was my entire family. I checked the website the hours were posted, it said closed at 11PM. So me and my entire family rushed over to the location at 830PM, went to open the door to restaurant it was LOCKED. There were no signs posted about their holiday hours, or even a sign that said they were CLOSED. Me and family waited for someone to at least open the door and say, \" I'm Sorry but we are Closed \" instead the workers who were wiping tables looked at us and ignored us. Would it have been so hard for anyone to just politely address myself and my entire family, but NO all we got was the cold freezing wind hitting us while waiting outside for not even a response. We often visit Mimi Cafe ALOT, just not that location and NOW for good reasons. A simple response goes a long way BUT since we didn't get one, you will not only lose me and my family as customers BUT all those we know who might now re-think about going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is the best I have a food allergy in the server was more than careful to help me out with my food allergy,place was nice and clean and the service was exceptional"}
{"text":"While not pricey or cheap (mid-priced), the quality exceeds the price. The Cheeseburger selection is spectacular! I would go back multiple times for it alone. Added pluses: easy parking, nice decor, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Mimi's Cafe. The selection is limited but the food is very good. Very rich and flavourful. I had a Bacon Avocado Omelette with a cappuccino both of which were done very well. The service was very nice and courteous. They have a nice comfortable atmosphere and free WiFi available. Will be happy to come back with a friend for another relaxing meal."}
{"text":"We went Sunday after church and it was full. The food was okay, but not outstanding.The service was excellent and the waitress even served our split order on separate plates. That's good service.  But that wasn't the problem. We -- party of adults -- were seated in an area where nearly every table had children. Loud children. One little girl shrieked repeatedly! I'm sure the parents thought that Little Precious was just as cute as could be and only after nearly everyone in the place was looking at them did they wake up and take the kid out! Little kids can't be expected to behave like adults. Could Mimi's have one room for adults only? If you want to carry on a conversation, you really do not want to have to compete with children. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Not very impressed- food was lacking flavor, waitress while friendly seemed distracted and forgot several items. We we're there before \"rush\" time so can only imagine service during peak hours"}
{"text":"I love the Tomato & Avocado Croissant. It's the perfect sandwich. Always. Never any complaints. Finish it up with the molten chocolate cake and you will be happy. It's the only chain restaurant that I actually want to dine at. Ever."}
{"text":"We had walked in and waited and waited. Finally a man says four. We said yes, and two kids. He asked a few other employees where to sit us. We walked pass the main part. Was empty. We were shown to back half.  If I could I would rate this restaurant a zero. My family and I went in to enjoy a nice family meal. Relax and talk. We had a coupon, and we ordered our food and we told our server that we have a coupon he said one moment and manager must come look at the coupon.  We waited and waited and a manager came out and he said no I cannot accept this coupon. So then I told him.  Can you please take it off my meal. After we paid our bill the manager comes over and tells us that by law we are required to eat the food no matter. We told him we will never return it was the worst service I have ever received but I'm not surprised because Mimi. Service and Manager named Pierce was the worst. He didn't try to make us happy. Just came out quoting the law."}
{"text":"Our server was Frederick and he was beyond amazing. I know good service when I see one because I am a server myself. He went above and beyond. We had ordered the mussels and although my husband and I didn't feel as though they were taking long, he kept apologizing and I think something went wrong in the kitchen to where it was taking longer then it should. He was super attentive and let a manger know about the appetizer and she took it off even though we didn't feel it was necessary. I use to work at Mimi's Cafe and I wanted to try the food again and see how it's changed. My husband loved his open faced turkey sandwich and the mussels. I felt the food was okay. Not horrible but not horrible. I still give it for stars purely for the fact that we had such an amazing server and such attentive service. FREDERICK IS AMAZINGGGGGGG!"}
{"text":"Very pretty building with a nice interior.  Our experience was very nice. We both had the turkey club and I could only finish one quarter of the sandwich along with the wonderful fries. My wife got the salad along with her club and she thought it was wonderful. Found out that I could order a hamburger medium rare which is the civilized way to eat it. My wife said that next time she is only going to order the deserts as they looked so good."}
{"text":"Meh.  Our waitress was nice but the food took a while to come out as it was pretty blah.  And I don't understand the change from New Orleans to Parisian theme.  It's not really French food and the decor isn't really French either.  I would be offended if I were a Frenchmen.  Sacre bleh!"}
{"text":"I typically stop in restaurants or coffee shops between my appointments to grab lunch and work on my laptop.  Today's service I had at mimi's café was above and beyond anywhere else I've been.   Lorraine was my server and she continued to be on top of everything I needed during my visit.  Because I was between appointments I stayed a little bit longer then a typical customer eating lunch and she was not bothered or annoyed at all.  It sure is refreshing when you have  genuine customer service with a smile. I wish all restaurants had a Lorraine!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. My husband and I were so excited to go out for dinner and have the rude surprise of a very inattentive waitress that you couldn't even track down named Gabrielle she took about 15 or 20 minutes to get around to taking order when it wasn't busy by any means and the other waiters at the other few tables that were there were definitely back and forth with their customers. Then when we got our food the steak was so bad we literally didn't even swallow a single bite because you couldn't even chew it so I guess my dogs are going to eat good tonight but I had a handful of fries and now I just spent $40 on dinner when I have to go get something else after. My my husband chicken entree was good that's the only reason why I give any stars. We thought we'd try a new place for dinner just to have it said disappointing night and wasted 40 bucks which would have been over 50 if I didn't have a coupon which is why we went there. And I we would have tried to get the food either fixed or maybe gotten something else but it's not like you could even find the waitress to talk to her we were lucky to finally get her checked long after we had been sitting there waiting. I literally made a Yelp account just so nobody else has to go through this"}
{"text":"ehh food was ok services forgot the oj and the toast"}
{"text":"Had Breakfast with Friends. I had the Bananas Foster waffle. the waffel itself was good. For the ridiculous price I was disappointed to find they don't serve real maple syrup. Basically corn syrup. Asked for lemon in my water (to help with the twist of our awfully AZ water) I had to ask a second time and then when asked if we want coffee my friend said no and she started to walk away before I could say yes. She then proceeded to the kitchen saying she would be back...5min later came back to fill my coffee. $32 is a lot for 2 breakfasts."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a large group, and got bumped by a larger group that called later.  Apparently money is more important than service or common courtesy at Mimi's."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is really bad, especially if you have little kids.  I don't know why I go back to this one, even though it's right up the street from us.  Maybe it's the hope that some day we'll get a waitress that gives a darn about you and will stop leading you to believe that you'll actually get decent service.  They greet you promptly, but after yesterday's service where the plates were pretty much thrown at me, never again.  Maybe they think I'll be a poor tipper because instead of ordering two kids meals, we order one?  Maybe it's because I'm more occupied with making sure my kids or ok rather than being super smiley to the waitresses there?  Maybe I just need to be 70 years old and order a cup of coffeee and a slice of whole wheat toast and give them a $10 tip?  There are other Mimi's in the area, but seriously, they're only a slight notch up from IHOP to have to deal with their attitudes.   We'll see what Mimi's corporate will do for me after they respond to the email I sent to them, too."}
{"text":"It is pretty much a crapshoot when you come here on the service you will receive. I have had GREAT service and I have had service that completely pissed me off and made me not want to come back here. However I did find  a server that was super awesome and i ask for him whenever I go ... Stephen.  Their breakfast is good...  But what I go for is the Asian Chicken Salad. Mostly that is because I have been kind of watching what I am eating and this has big chunks of freshly roasted chicken, cabbage and lettuce, (they will remove the fried wontons if you ask)  However, their chicken cordon bleu is beyond delicious. It has great texture and great flavor . It really fits into a comfort food file .  I also love their french onion soup, It is flavorful, and  and has sourdough bread  in it, with melty cheese all over the top.  Their orange juice is extremely good, fresh squeezed and served in a chilled glass. sooooo good. It isa good place for a group of people OR if you are just going out for a date.  It can get kind of noisy but in cafe style settings it is something you expect ..."}
{"text":"I always like to come here with my parents because it is such a homey atmosphere.  We always get good service and i like pretty much everything ive tried here. My parents love to frequent mimis when they come to visit las vegas."}
{"text":"I have seen this location go downhill. We keep going back thinking that it will  be better than the last time, but it's not.   It has a rundown feel to it. It's not that the decor is bad, it's pretty new, it's the service and the attitude of the staff that is rundown. Despite the food being good, the service really has deteriorated and the management doesn't seem to have noticed, or even care.   Everything is now an extra, 50c there, $1 there, portions are smaller, and it all mounts up. The entrees are already just under $10 for many things. It's not THAT good that I would pay much more for what they are offering. So, it's goodbye Mimi's, it was good while it lasted, but I am done!"}
{"text":"A friend invited me to have dinner at Mimi's and I was really excited when I looked the menu. I wish I wouldn't have had such high expectations because I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the Fillet of \"Soul\" with fresh vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were well-seasoned but the fish was not and the vegetables were nothing spectacular. I have since been back a couple of times and sampled the Chicken Tostada Salad and the Honey Dijon Salmon. All the dishes I have tried have been average. It's a decent place to go for a relatively inexpensive meal but its very similar to a T.G.I. Fridays or Applebees."}
{"text":"Horrible. Menus covered with fingerprints, dirty silverware,bad food and miserable staff. The waitress was unfriendly, said there was no cheese in the potatoes, yet they were crawling in it, and half-cooked to boot.  A bite of bacon was worse than a mouthful of salt, and the waffle was about as bland as it gets. I really tried to find a redeeming factor, all I found was the butter was fresh. At the end, the waitress asked if I was done with my (1/4 eaten) meal, and when I said I was, she said \"Good!\". I definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Epic Mother's Day failure!  We made a reservation a week out and were told we would have to wait. When we sat down the server spilled water all over my sister, who was dressed up for Mother's Day.  An hour after we ordered, my niece received her food, but no one else in our party.  30 minutes later the food started to trickle in. When most of us were served, the server asked if we needed anything else, ignoring my crying 6 year old who was starving and had not received any food."}
{"text":"Always so wonderful to come here for breakfast.. Service is wonderful and the food is to die for ... I come all the time love love love the muffins and of course the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"good breakfast, glad they have lots of gluten free options! potatoes and hollandaise is gluten free. however the taste is not 100%... could be crispier/saltier sometimes!!"}
{"text":"The management is horrible, they have no communication skills with the rest of staff! Need help with product knowledge and menu items and when they are available."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch.  Went here with my son who is an older teen.  We had actually just been at another restaurant closer to home where we had to wait for a table.  But when we were seated, that place had tables pushed so close together there was no privacy, tables were extremely small AND the menu didn't even have blueberry pancakes.  Who doesn't serve that for breakfast? So we moved ourselves to Mimi's which we love.  It was worth driving a few more miles.  Our server was perfect and our food was excellent.  The mocha lattes tasted as amazing as they were presented.  There really could not have been anything else we could have asked for unless it were free.  HA!"}
{"text":"We were served the artichoke frites with the lemon-basil aioli.  The aoili (which is similar to a may base) had a shiny, dark yellow, coagulated film over part of it.  We touched the sauce with a finger and found it was barely cool.  When we pointed it out to the waiter, he basically acted like, so what's the problem with that?  When we asked if, because it's a mayo base, maybe the darker shiny film may not be safe to eat, he acted the same way, as if he didnt understand why we had an issue.  We were not offered a solution, just that we could use a marinara sauce to dip them in instead.    The manager, who was busy helping our friendly -- but sometimes very absent -- server deliver his orders, must not have been informed of the aioli issue, because he did not speak to us about it.    Beyond that, the food (a mussels dish with spicy marinara sauce and pasta) was good, except for the flavorless french bread and something that resembled whipped butter but tasted more like whipped vegetable oil that we were served before the meal.  But because of the possible gastrointestinal hazard of an aioli sauce and the lack of concern about it, i just can't bring myself to make this a 3"}
{"text":"I was here saturday afternoon. my waitress, kaci was exceptionally friendly. I got the hibiscus to drink which was quite refreshing. the crab fritters and crab cakes were delicious. Their chocolate mousse and apple pie was everything my taste buds were looking for. all around very pleased."}
{"text":"We returned for our winter stay in Las Vegas and remembered Mimi's as one of our favorite places for Sunday breakfast.  Usually we are quite satisfied with everything.  It was early (9:00 am) and not at all crowded. The service was great and our coffee cups were kept full. The atmosphere, as usual is charming.  Both my wife and I had the steak and eggs and if she were writing this probably would have tacked on another star.  Her steak was fine, but mine was tough and shot through with gristle.  I can accept that breakfast steaks aren't the prime cut.  But for the price I believe they could have paid more attention to the tenderness and/or maybe marinated/tenderized them a little bit more."}
{"text":"Brought my mom a day early for mothers day. Thinking it would be a good idea since I figured they would be extremely busy the next day. Boy was I wrong. Walked in at 7:30 am got seated right away which was nice. The waitress was really sweet took our order and submitted it. About 30 minutes later were still waiting for our meal. She brings out our meal I got the cinnamon roll french toast. It was so disgusting and hard as a rock. I told her um I can't eat this. She returned it no problem. My mom's comes out just regular pancakes, they were all doughy in the middle. She returns those. I jokingly said maybe you need a new cook, she laughs and goes he's new. Um wow!!! So I say just give me the pancakes. No problem 2nd attempt they came out ok. Eggs were all runny and cold. Just terrible cooking experience, we joked around and said we should have just gone to the buffet. Ugh. But the manager did comp our whole meal abd gave us a gift card but I felt bad bc I wanted to take my mom for mothers day breakfast."}
{"text":"The minute my coffee was halfway, it was filled up...the service here was great.  I had a business breakfast and I'll certainly be back to do it again."}
{"text":"The service is good but very long wait to get your food Waitress are  very slow and the main manager never ever comes out to see  if the food was good or the service. Looks like the cooks work very hard to get the food out quick its the waitress that dont move fast to get it out quick so people can enjoy there food.And managers should take the time to ask how is service food."}
{"text":"Mimis Cafe has the best chicken cordon  bleu in Arizona.  The chicken breast is breaded with panko and is crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  The ham is grilled the swiss cheese and the sauce makes all the flavors so yummy.  I eat this dish with their baby potatoes and broccoli. You will always leave happy after eating this dish."}
{"text":"REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MIMI'S CAFE TODAY! We went today for a late breakfast. We ordered 2 Farmhouse Taco entrees, 1 Egg & bacon w/ waffles entree, an order of white toast, side of breakfast potatoes and a side of 2 pancakes. A side of 2 pancakes is not entree. The manager came over to see our coupon an only took off the side of pancakes. My husband told me to let it go but I can't. I go to Mimi's 4 to 5 times a month and this just pissing me off. So next time I have a coupon we will order less or 2 of our party will be on 1 check and the 3rd person will have their own check."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min and left after I got no service. They were quick to seat me but walked by as I waited. Left and went to Chili's to wait 20min. Should have known when no one was there at 6 on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The burgers here are surprisingly delicious considering Mimi's is not known for them. Always perfectly cooked on a soft brioche bun. The menu has gone through many changes in the last year or so, but food quality has remained great. Buy-one-get-one coupons are available when you sign up for their emails, which always make for a great deal. Weekends get a little busy so prepare for a small wait. Definitely a Henderson favorite."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. The bread was as food as it gets.  That is their best offering. We had chicken and it was good but the mash potatoes stuck to the roof of our mouths. Service was ok. Nothing to make this place memorable enough to go back to on our week long trip to the area."}
{"text":"I have been to a few of Mimi's around, and mostly they are fine.  BUT this particular site is where a co worker had a Thanksgiving reservation for her and her son, and when she called to confirm it, they had no record, and offered no solution!  She is a single mom, I was there when she made the reservation, and she had the number on her cell phone log, so it was not her error, rather someone didn't do their job enough to make sure a family had their Thanksgiving dinner covered.  Yes, service is everything, so due to this one very big mistake, I won't go there nor will I refer anyone.  She since called another Mimi's and they are getting her and her son in for their Holiday Dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Mimi's Cafe since I was itty bitty and my family took me there growing up in California. It was always the go-to place for gatherings and weekend breakfast or lunch meetings. I have never been disappointed, until this location last weekend! I have been before without any issues, but we came here for a good, hearty meal (so I had hoped) before a Cardinals game and I ended up with the worse meal I have ever had here, or at any restaurant. I ordered the corned beef eggs benedict. I am usually never disappointed with an eggs benedict, and I have never ordered a corned beef one before but I pictured it as shredded meat and eggs with hollandaise sauce on an english muffin, like the traditional eggs benedict minus the ham. I was very wrong and they brought me what looked something awful and putrid, almost like cat food (or throw up) and there was no english muffin, just this mashed up disgusting meat mixed with onions or something else, with poached egg on top. No substance, and no presentation...it looked horrible and tasted even worse. I was so disappointed. And left hungry. I didn't say anything because I already had a coupon so we didn't pay for that meal as it was, with buy one get one free, but I felt like I got ripped off and I probably should have complained but I wasn't in the mood to say something that day. Also we elected for patio seating and were ignored outside for the most part, due to the inside being crowded. No drink refills or attention. And if someone was checking in on us, perhaps they would have seen the tragic look upon my face at my first bad experience at what used to be one of my favorites. I guess it will be Black Bear Diner or Tj's next time....*sigh*"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was here and didn't realize the whole menu had been changed... Unfortunately, some of my favorite things were taken off & I wasn't crazy about the new options which is why I gave it 3 stars... The service was great for a busy brunch morning and the food was okay but not great... It has a more French flair which I think is difficult to do when it's not high end but for the price it was pretty good... I'm not sure if I'll go again for brunch but might check it out for lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"As regular customers we had an off experience we thought we would share. Entered the restaurant at 8pm on a Friday night and was greeted and seated right away, the hostess was great. Once we sat down, not one person acknowledged us for over 10 minutes. Multiple servers, employees, and a manager walked past us without saying a word and a couple even made eye contact with me.  Our menus were closed, tables near us were being cleaned and we were just overlooked. After 12 minutes we got up and left the restaurant and then I went back into share with an employee to let them know, not to get anybody in trouble, but to just let them know we were disappointed and to hopefully help them fix the process.   When I went back inside once again I was greeted quickly at the door and I shared my experience.  The server who talked to me was polite,  apologetic, and offered free muffins.  I didn't want muffins, just wanted to let them know about the situation, so I denied them from the employee.   We will return in hopes of better service in the future, I mean I really do like their muffins."}
{"text":"Ok, where to begin. The windows were filthy, you could not see out them. The service was ok until the point we ordered a burger for my daughter, medium rare. Now, we know exactly what beef temps are I was a prior chef. It comes out rare almost raw and the waiter has the balls to say just so you are aware next time you order a burger out, this is medium rare and not medium. My wife was livid and looked at me I looked at her smiled and let it go. He then proceeds to tell us they ran out of roast beef but they have pot roast they can use. I had to asked several times for my drink to be refilled. This was by far the worst place we have eaten in Phoenix on our vacation, it was not by our choice, family was meeting there and I did check out yelp prior to. The men's bathroom had a urinal from high school with pee all over the floor, smelled, I mean keep the bathroom clean at least.....never again.."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time had their quiche and it was really good. The second time I had the steak and frites medium rare. It was a little under done but nothing that a microwave couldn't fix. The fries were crispy homecut. Had the cheese cake for dessert and it was not as thick as typical hers cake and wasn't overly sweet which I appreciated. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Not the normal food I like, but the staff are always very friendly, and very accommodating. I ask for weird things, like milk on the side, and they never make a fuss about it.   Plus, I am a sucker for their pot pies:)"}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled this time. Our server spilled drinks on me and table. Took while to get back for order. Didn't check if we needed refills etc.  Gave me incorrect Birthday treat dry cake etc.  wasn't thrilled with my lunch. But was with family celebrating do made up for it."}
{"text":"It is a crowded, family oriented place for average food.  Over sized bakery items & portions.  Fast food style similar to a \"Perkins.\""}
{"text":"Our meals were good. Madame loves their French onion soup and makes a light lunch of it. I enjoyed the roast chicken crepes. The service was a real disappointment. Once the dishes were delivered we never saw a server again until we walked up to the counter and asked for our check. We wanted dessert but couldn't order it."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Mimi's in awhile and I found a coupon buy one get one so we thought we'd go for lunch.  I ordered the Beer Battered Fish and Frites and hub ordered the Simmered Meat Sauce and French Pasta. First of all -- mine was 14.99   I got 4 pieces of batter fried fish that looked and tasted like Van De Camps frozen from a  box over some wilted fries and a 1/4 cup of coleslaw.  Hub's meal was about a heaping cup of tomatoey sauce over pasta over cooked.  Mine was 14.99 his was 13.00  and in order to get the buy 1 get 1 you had to order two drinks at $3 a pop.  What a disappointment all around.  I used to come here a lot years ago and always had the French Quarter so I didn't expect to be so disappointed.  Won't be coming back... and am surprised it was so busy that day.  People must be easily impressed by mediocracy."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch to celebrate our anniversary. They told us a 10 minute wait and gave me one of those pagers. It was crowded so we sat at the far end of the waiting area away from the bar. About 15 minutes later, an annoyed host came looking for us, saying our time had come, then looked puzzled when I pulled out the pager showing him it had not gone off. We walked to the table and my wife began to shiver, I have good bit of extra padding (ie fat) and I was cold, She was dressed for Arizona spring not an icebox. I ordered from the breakfast menu and my wife got a soup and sandwich combo. I have had better food at IHOP and IHOP sucks. The only thing that saved me from getting ill was the portion size, since there wasn't enough to fill my stomach. When you pay $12 for a meal it should at least fill you up. My meal came with a glass of orange juice, which I declined since I am diabetic, Nothing was offered as a replacement and no concession was made on our check. My wife was trying to warm up by eating the soup, but it was cold, and attempted the sandwich and the bottom bread literally came apart. When we asked about the cold (after flagging down our waitress) she said that it had been so hot earlier that they \"Cranked the AC down\" The high that day was 96. If that is \"SO HOT\" I would hate to see what happens to them during the summer. I won't have to worry about it, since we are never going back. We will journey to the Fiesta Mall location where we always get 4-star food and service"}
{"text":"We have visited this location 3 times. Generally, the service is not good however the food is not bad. However, on our most recent visit we had ordered the Chicken Fettuccine dish. To our surprise the chicken pieces were not fully cooked. We had showed the waiter a piece of chicken that was taken from this dish and it was mushy and pink. Definitely, not cooked. The manager came over and removed the dish from our bill. However, that was the least of my worries. My husband unfortunately now has food poisoning from the chicken. The good news is that the manager gave us a coupon for a complimentary appetizer. How kind..."}
{"text":"Service started VERY SLOW. We waited over 10 minutes to get any service after being seated. Finally got some help and of course by that time we had more they enough time and already knew what were going to order. I've had a huge hankering for a Bloody Mary and remembered that they had a decent one so I ordered one of their Bloody Mary's. It was YUM! And that was the only good part of the meal and our experience. My husband ordered the Monterey chicken thing with chicken noodle soup and I got the Monterrey chicken burger with fries and corn chowder. Bacon on the side, which I had to ask to get again cause they forgot it at first. My burger was suppose to come with a pesto aioli. And it did not. Disappointing. Only came with mayo. Sad. Chicken although was tasty. Corn chowder, yum. My husband was not impressed. So half and half. I mean its Mimi's Cafe so it is what it is. Blood Mary and the corn chowder, yes please try them. And the bread pudding too, Yum! Don't hold your breathe about the service though."}
{"text":"I know working holidays are very stressful but the the hostess at the front with blonde hair and glasses should consider a career switch. This industry is all about staying calm and not folding and she does completely opposite. She is the first face you see when you walk in and she doesn't even look up to say hi or greet in any way because she seems like she doesn't want to do this anymore. She told me it was 30 minutes and after an hour had already passed she then told me it would possibly be another hour. I work in the industry so I completely understand how holidays get hectic but I am only writing this review so Mimi's considers moving that hostess to another area where she does not give off bad vibes to everyone that is there to enjoy time with their loved ones."}
{"text":"We took some guests who are visiting from Europe here last night.  Our experience in the past has been very good.  Last night, however, was very bad.  When we arrived there were several tables within our sight cluttered with the remains of previous diners.  We were told we would have a 15-20 minute wait for a table.  We were seated before that time had expired... But then we waited for about 10 minutes before being offered water or other beverages... Not acceptable especially when they were not busy.  We were also short two table settings and had to ask for them from the server.  When he bought them, he simply put the silverware in a pile on the center of the table and didn't bring any additional napkins.  We had to ask another server to bring those.  We had to ask for a replacement for one of the small plates used for bread as it was dirty.  I ordered steak and frites, my wife the French Onion soup, and our guests ordered the pot roast.  My steak upon arrival was tepid at best and either the frites died waiting at the pass or they were microwaved.  In either case they were inedible and I sent them back.  Neither of the servings of pot roast were hot and on one plate the mashed potatoes were downright cold.  I won't write off Mimi's just yet as any place can have an off night and our previous experiences have been good.  However I will be cautious and our next visit will most certainly not include guests."}
{"text":"I use to love going to Mimi's so when we were wanting to go to breakfast one weekend morning, I chose here. First once I arrived I stood at the podium waiting for someone to come seat us foe over nearly 10  minutes. The one item I was excited about having were their amazing roasted seasoned red potatoes they served with their breakfasts .. but they are no more!... replaced with chopped up unseasoned white potatoes with absolutely no flavor at all. I had the ham and swiss crepe...really too rich and no identifiable flavor profile (for me) and didn't finish. The one amazing thing was the strawberry/blackberry mimosa..maybe I should have had a couple of those before the meal  :("}
{"text":"We came here for the muffins and decided to stay for lunch. I can definitely say this place is one of the best for service. Our drinks were never empty. Our food was served quick and everything we ordered was great. The half roasted chicken was amazing. Good portion sizes even for the appetizers."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  Took 10 minutes to get greeted, even after we had to ask 3 times for a server!  Took 20 minutes just to get drinks.  We were  never offered bread.  No drink refills.  No apologies for having to wait so long for a server.  Never saw a manager.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Good not Impressive   This breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot is alright.  The decor is very welcoming, with soft booths and well-spaced tables.  The breakfast is far better than the lunch/dinner offerings.  I usually go with the four alarm omelette, which has scallions, jalapenos, jack cheese, and a homemade chiptole sauce all topped with tortilla strips.  Again, it is good not great.  The service is always great, many of the servers have been here a long time and now how to be friendly and efficient.    Think of Mimi's as an upscale Denny's or IHOP.  It is consistently average, and a good place to come with a group for relaxing brunch. There isn't much that stands out here, just all around solid fare."}
{"text":"Reliable and consistent.   Food is good and the wait staff is very friendly.  The restaurant is somewhat dated and could use an upgrade, but this does not deter me from eating here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Always great food and service, but decor kinda dated"}
{"text":"Today I had the steak and eggs and french fries coffee brand muffin all good and service was excellent"}
{"text":"Been here twice before and never reviewed them. Tonight I was mailed a buy one meal get one free coupon. The wife and I decided to give it a chance. We were greeted promptly and sat down quickly. Waitress was pleasant but not attentive. I ran out of iced tea three times waiting for the meal that seemed to take a long time. The appetizer we ordered (calamari) seemed strange can't put my finger on it but I think it was processed as a mcnugget would be. The meal arrived after the waitress said it will be right out twice. Not worth the price if you ask me. I'm critical when it comes to food but the wife is not. She will like all food, this time she agrees with me. We ate but I am writing this review while I'm waiting for my fast food from yogis."}
{"text":"Mimi's Café is a hit or miss for me. It's a typical chain restaurant, which I tend to avoid. However, I did enjoy their grilled salmon salad with strawberries, which was an unusual ingredient to have with salmon. I enjoy their breads that they provide for free and have bought, I think, the banana bread to go. I didn't care for the breakfast and wouldn't try that again. Breakfast is my favorite meal, I'm really picky when it comes to that. I tried their pot pie once and it was just OK. I wish they had crust inside rather than just on top. I'll still go back for a quick, inexpensive bite. It's not that bad."}
{"text":"If you want gunk in your glass, horrible cheesecake, or cold fries, then this is the place for you!  Come on in!  The corn chowder was okay, if you're into luke warm sludge that somewhat resembles a chowder.  Don't bother asking for clean glassware, silverware, or dishes, because they're all spotted and may or may not have been washed.   The main dishes were much better, albeit nothing stellar.  Mediocre at best.   The manager was excellent and addressed our numerous problems quickly and touched our table twice.  But there shouldn't have been problems in the first place.  This restaurant needs better training and staff.   Don't get me started on the cheesecake.  I think instead of cheesecake, they may have taken some expired cottage cheese and put it on top of some breadcrumbs.  Also, I think the refrigerator that keeps the cake cold is broken because it was room temperature.  The decor is fitting though... it looks right out of Grandma'a kitchen or a 1990's fast food restaurant.  Menu design is horrible and doesn't do a good job listing out side dishes.  The light fixtures in the ceiling need a severe dusting.  There are too many things to list out.   P.S.  The bread was horrible."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this place! However, every time we have gone back the service gets worse and worse. Tonight was our last meal at this location.  Service was poor. There were only two servers and a manager running food and tending tables. Our waiter forgot our drinks multiple times and that's after being seated for almost ten minutes waiting for him to approach our table. Then we he cane back he forgot one of our drinks. No big deal. We ordered our food and waited. We had to ask for a bread basket twice before we finally revived it. The food arrived and the 10oz prime rib came out with nothing but fat! We sat and waited and waited and tried to get the attention of any employee but yet none seem to be around. Finally another server walked by and i asked her to please grab a manager. She said she would. I then proceeded to see her see the manger. Stand next to the manager and yet not tell her once to come to our table as all the food sat there. They both were behind the prep/computer area and yet still no manager. Finally our server walked by and i grabbed him and explained the situation. That the $25 prime rib was all fat. He then asked if we would like to wait for another and we decided to just ask for the check. That took forever. Service has just gone so bad here. The manager never came by once. The place is dusty and just looks run down."}
{"text":"The one star I gave is strictly for the kind waitress who took our order.  Otherwise,what an experience.  I took my sister to Mimi's on Bell road yesterday.  I was told it would be 10-15 minutes before we got seated - It was 1:15 pm and there was hardly anyone there!  I asked to sit in the main room and mentioned \"nobody's in there\"...I was told, \"they're starting to fill it up now.  Finally after being seated, we ordered the same thing - the \"Mozzarella and tomato\" salad. The salads came with a honey muffin.  The service was excellent - attentive and caring.  Kudos to the kind lady who waited on us.  Within 2-3 hours after returning home, I became violently ill.  I got the chills and started to shake so badly. And then, the nausea and vomiting started - lasting until almost midnight.  I also ran a 102 fever.  I called my sister this morning and asked her if she had gotten sick.  YES, she had!  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  I called the restaurant this morning and was given to the \"District Manager\".  I don't believe he could have cared less.  He told me \"nobody else got sick from that meal yesterday\" - I said, well, my sister and I did\" ... silence from this man.  While we were eating, there was no one left in the restaurant.  He asked me how soon after we ate did we experience symptoms. I replied 2+hours.  He came back with \"well, if it was food poisoning, that usually takes 4 hours\".  Since I had the food poisoning website pulled up on my computer - it shows that anywhere from 2-6 hours after you eat, you experience the symptoms of food poisoning\".  Again, silence. I asked what is the recourse, he said he'd file a claim and I'd probably be hearing from someone from corporate.  No \"I'm sorry, you got sick, or I hope you come back\" or anything that remotely resembled compassion.  Needless to say, I will never return nor bring guests to that Mimi's again."}

{"text":"I am a fan of Mimi's from way back.  I think their first restaurant was in Anaheim, where I grew up.  So I was sorry to find that the Mimi's in Centennial is a disaster.  I'm pretty sure it's the management's fault - or the LACK of effective management.  Sometimes, service isn't too bad, but I have had 2 visits that were just awful.  I think they are under-staffed.  And they don't have enough glassware or silverware - so sometimes they just run out!  This location also doesn't have any alcohol, just beer and wine.  The food quality is ok - it's the service that is bad here.  There are so many fabulous restaurants in Vegas, there's no reason to ever visit this Mimi's again!  If you're nearby - try Rachel's instead or even the Einstein Brothers bagel place will be a better experience!"}
{"text":"Decided to go to Mimi's for some Sunday night comfort food. What the heck is happening to Mimi's? Can you choose a menu and stick with it for a while? The constantly changing menu is incredibly aggravating. So..... we try to order dinner. How about the salad with salmon? NO - off the menu! The waiter said it can still be ordered but with honey mustard dressing? no, no, no, - Mimi's no longer has honey mustard dressing. WHAT? We asked if the hamburgers were 4 or 8 ounces as 8 ounces is too much and food is wasted. He said 4 ounces (with confidence) and when we asked him to double check, he walked over to the mgr. and came back determined they are 4 ounces. We ordered a burger - it was big and didn't look like a 1/4 pound. We mentioned this to our server and he said \"Well, they used to call it the French Quarter so it must be a 1/4 pound\". Really? For fun, we asked him to check with the chef. He came back and said \"it's 7.9 ounces\". Well, there goes your French Quarter theory, young man. The food was so-so, service was okay but the waiter could have made more $$$ if he knew the menu and could have bothered to check with the kitchen staff who might actually know the size of the burger patty. Overall, we did have dinner but there are way too many places to eat in ANY town to bother with Mimi's."}
{"text":"I've been to many a Mimi.  I've yet to be disappointed at any of them, this location is no exception.    Took my daughter and sis for brunch.  I had the cajun chicken sausage and eggs with a pumpkin muffin.  it comes with a glass of oj - cost $9.50 .  it's actually a good deal considering the OJ - do you see what they charge for a glass of OJ at Denny's - holy cow ! Though i gotta admit, the sausage sure tasted like something i bought at trader joes a few months ago.  sis' eggs benedict - just ok - ham slice too thick and a little too salty.  not enough hollandaise sauce.  Daughters chicken pesto ciabatta - big sammie - love  the pesto !  i tell ya one thing - the location is a little odd - at the far end of this huge shopping center - and let me tell you, the access to the center sucks big time."}
{"text":"Menu seems to be getting smaller and smaller and less flavor and size.  I order a benedict and the picture looked so much more pleasant than the order I received. There really was no taste to the potatoes or the eggs and the hollandaise sauce was not good. The prices are not bad but I was disappointed and will not be coming here again.  The saving grace here was the honey bran muffin. A little bit of butter and the muffin was amazing. I would get some to go everyday here if I had time.  The service was great but the place is surely spiraling downhill from when I first starting coming here."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast with my in-laws and 1 yr old son & the service was GREAT!! Our waitress Laura she was a sweetheart & on the ball with everything (keep up the great work!) . We will be coming here for Breakfast and asking for Laura from now on :)."}
{"text":"I just love this place. Us old guys eat here every Friday. Stephanie is our wonderful server and takes great care of us. The food is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Service is great, the restaurant is very pleasant decor wise, clean and inviting.  There was plenty of parking and we were greeted by a pleasant hostess as well as a very nice server.   Our food choices were okay, a Meat Loaf dinner, a Club Sandwich, French Dip and Turkey and Brie melt. Everyone was pleased though I tasted something in either the bread or the butter on the bun of my French dip. A complimentary basket of Demi loaves and muffin tops were very nice.  I ordered coffee which was freshly brewed and it had a nice balance   While this is a chain restaurant I think it ranked better than most other chains."}
{"text":"After about 20 u-turns I finally pulled into Mimi's expecting a great breakfast.  Mimi's is located in a busy area, crowded with restaurants and retail, but it is a terrible location!  It's hard to see from the street and the entrance/exit is tricky.    Anyway, I have only been to one other Mimi's (on several occasions) and the food was always very good.  I have eaten there once or twice for dinner and it was pretty typical fare, but the breakfast has always been a standout for me.  The pancakes at \"my\" Mimi's were daydream worthy.    So, kids and I arrive expecting similar fare.  I must say I was kind of sad.  I ordered pancakes for all three of us and they were less than impressive. They were literally \"flat as a pancake\" (couldn't resist)!  They were so super thin and wimpy.  I think the batter maker was having an off day.  I have eaten much better pancakes at IHOP.  My son's chocolate chip pancakes were just regular pancakes with some chips sprinkled on top.  Seriously?  I ordered the seasonal pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon apples.  They were almost too sweet to eat.  Bummer.  The bacon was great though.  The muffins going by looked awesome and I almost ordered one, but didn't want to look like a total piggo with my already full plate in front of me so I stopped myself.  The muffins are always a Mimi's highlight.    But, the upside to Mimi's is that we had a great waitress.  I'd peg her as career type waitress, super professional and on top of everything.  All of the other staff were friendly and helpful.  The place was clean and neat and charming in that comforting always-the-same chain restaurant kind of way.  I would def. give Mimi's at least one more try because I know the potential is there, but if it is a dud again then I am off to brave the IHOP crowd."}
{"text":"Amazing service.....amazing food.....amazing atmosphere!!  Couldn't ask for anything more from a restaurant.  We had smoked salmon Benedict and breakfast tacos...both were fantastic.  Manager gave us two complimentary muffins for our first time visit.  If we lived here...we would be making a weekly visit.  Now this is how u run a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Mimi's is their bakery items, from the signature bread basket they bring you before your meal with slices of carrot bread and baguette (along with a cholesterol-free whipped spread) to the choice of muffins that come with certain meals and can also be ordered separately. Their muffin choices include carrot raisin nut, blueberry, buttermilk spice, and my favorite, honey bran.  These muffins are so good that I sometimes order a four-pack to go.  Mimi's is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and offers an all-day breakfast menu.  It is by no means a health-oriented restaurant, although they do attempt to make some concessions to the health-conscious.  There is a \"Fresh and Fit\" menu, from which you can order egg-based dishes without the yolks, and a \"Just Enough\" menu, from which you can order entrees in more moderate portions.    The prices are affordable even on a student's budget.  A regular entree is lot of food, and after enjoying the breads from the signature bread basket and having some soup or salad, you should be taking home at least half of your entree for another meal -- unless you're a total glutton.    I couldn't find any indication that Mimi's uses chemical-free meats or meats from free-range animals, so I assume they don't -- which is no surprise because unfortunately that's the norm.  My last time there, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Fettucini, which was not the healthiest of dishes in terms of calories or cholesterol, but it tasted all right.  My main complaint is that some of the chicken pieces contained tendons, but that's an issue with most tenderloins.  Mimi's is popular with families and offers a wide range of dishes and a unique and interesting atmosphere.  I've been there a few times, and the service has always been adequate or better. Because of its bakery items, it's a good bet that I'll go there again -- especially since I got that breakfast coupon in the mail."}
{"text":"Mimi's not sure if you have been listening...  On another trip to Mimi's (had a coupon) decided to try it again...  New Years Day...it was busy- we decided to sit outside- no wait.  We were waited by the manager Aaron as they were so busy and unfortunately some of their staff called in sick...  anyway...  he was extremely attentive and more importantly the food was prepared exactly correctly.  Good job Mimi's! and Aaron!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! We had a very large party & stopped in before a baseball game so we were on a strict schedule. I loved the atmosphere but the service was not that great. We had to keep looking for the waiter & ask for refills..He just seemed to be no where to be found when we needed him."}
{"text":"Sooo much potential the food  was actually good but the waitress didn't bring more waters didn't check up. My boyfriend had to eat his waffles with no syrup because we could not get the attention of our waitress or help from anyone else."}
{"text":"Well Mimi, you finally got it. Kind of. Back are Some classics like the meatloaf and chicken parmesan with a few changes. Not bad, the waiter we had told us Mimi is under new ownership, possibly P.F. Changs? Not verified. Dinner was ok and we are more likely to go back now."}
{"text":"I've been to the one at Desert Ridge twice now for breakfast.  Both times the waitstaff has messed up the order.  Its a simple order, side of Bacon.  The food is good, it's only eggs and toast, but the waitstaff is is slow, forgetful, can be rude and doesn't know the menu.  Both times the restaurant was not busy, so the wait staff wasn't slammed.  If you go, make sure you stay on top of the waitstaff or you won't get the correct order."}
{"text":"Love Mimi's! Great selection on the menu; delicious food; good service... what's not to like?! Mimosas are delicious; great quiches and other breakfast items; great lunch and dinner choices i.e. chicken pot pie; good selection of salads; roast beef; hamburgers, etc. Plus, it's reasonably priced. Convenient location. Love Mimi's!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant so much. It is such a pleasure to come here every time.        The food is always so good. The service is a lovely experience.  There is so very much to choose from on the menu.   You could never say you don't like what is on the menu, some thing for everyone.  Lots of parking in the lot. Plus, don't forget your coupon. Sign up on their website and they will send you coupons all the time."}
{"text":"Always good atmosphere and food. Our server, Gabriela, was courteous and attentive to all our needs. She showered our granddaughter with attention and affection. The food was excellent as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"The decor at Mimi's is decidedly French but, unfortunately, so is the service. Although the wait staff wasn't maître d' snooty, we certainly didn't feel welcome. There was no one there to greet us, and we stood at the front desk for nearly five minutes before we were acknowledged. Our waiter was friendly but slow, and he barely interacted with us. We also had to ask for the check, which eventually was brought out by another server, and then we had to wait again for the bill to be picked up.  That said, our food was fine; nothing to rave about, but not the worst I've eaten. I had the roasted chicken crepes and my husband had the bacon & egg cheeseburger. We had a buy-one-get-one coupon, and they had a $5 wine promotion, so we got out of there for under $40 (with tip).  One other note: There were about 20 customers in the restaurant, and my husband and I were the youngest by at least 20 years -- and we're no spring chickens. I've been to Mimi's for brunch before, and I had a much better time. The brunch clientele also seemed to be a mix of older folks and younger families. So maybe we were just here on an off night. Nonetheless, if I return to Mimi's, I think I'll stick with the early birds."}
{"text":"Pros: Better than both Denny's and IHOP(which is saying a lot since I still love both those places).  Reasonable prices for the quality(may be steep for some people but you get what you pay for). VERY good quality breakfast food items. Pretty nice looking restaurant period. The muffins are awesome.  Cons: Weird entrance. The cheese in my omlette was WAY too rubbery. It was still good though, I just may never get it again though unfortunately.  Very good cafe type of place. I will always have a soft spot for IHOP but this place is definitely a step up! IHOP and Denny's are really just average, this is above and beyond."}
{"text":"How does this place have bad reviews?!?! We were given two gift cards for a total of $50 over the course of a year. We hadn't gone because I saw some bad reviews but on a whim, we decided to have dinner there after hanging onto those cards for a year. The vibe was nice, they have a kid's menu, the waitress was fantastic, the portions were more than generous and the food was fantastic! Seriously, it was some of the best food I've ever eaten. It was expensive but that is the only con I can think of. We even ordered the classic ensemble desert, I was expecting three very tiny deserts but they were a pretty decent size. My son loved the brownie, my husband loved the cinnamon apples and I loved the banana bread pudding. I would LOVE to go here on a regular basis, if only I had the money."}
{"text":"I was with a large group today (10 people) and a few minutes after we sat down a HUGE sewer roach crawled across my foot! I jumped up and screamed. Next thing you know it made it's way down the line and crawled over three of my friend's feet! Finally, we stepped on it and ran and got the waitress. Gross. This is no reflection on the waitress - she was very apologetic - but seriously, a happy group reunion turned into a total gross out. We all wondered what was creeping around in the kitchen that we couldn't see! The Mimi's in Scottsdale is nice, this location is dirty and the a/c in the back room where we were seated was turned up. We were all sweating. (It was 93 outside today). I think the roach was trying to escape to the air conditioned side of the restaurant! Will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan of Mimi's Tomato Soup and Grilled Cheese - it's SOOOOO good!  However the service leaves a lot to be desired, and has declined over time.  As a party of 2, we waited about 10 minutes to be seated, even though there were empty tables everywhere.  It was Easter Sunday so I appreciate that they were open, but they had a limited \"holiday menu\" and claimed that anything not on the menu would take an hour or more to prepare.  Everything on the special menu was meat-centric... I'm a vegetarian and made that clear to the server, and I ordered my favorite comfort food, which thankfully did not take an hour, even though the grilled cheese was not on the holiday menu, the soup was.  We had to wait a LOT, for the food, for the check, for pretty much everything we were waiting, despite a fairly average number of tables in use (not slow, but not busy either).    The reason I'm writing this review, and really the ONLY reason I'm giving two stars instead of three, is that halfway through my soup, I felt something chewy in my mouth, and took it out to find a piece of bacon - bacon is NOT an ingredient in the tomato basil soup and never has been at Mimi's.  I never eat meat and as such my stomach is VERY sensitive to meat (I once took the bacon off of a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich and ate it and got sick from the bacon grease), not to mention I just feel like eating flesh is gross.  I know it's not gross for everyone, but I've been vegetarian most of my life and it is gross for me...  Anyway, I told the server this, and he gave me a muffin.  It was a super lame response to me finding something in my food that could make me physically ill."}
{"text":"The food was ok however the host  had a hard time doing her job she first said she couldnt sit us right away then tell us our table is ready we show up the table and it was dirty then move us again to another table which was the table we had requested to begin with!! yea hot mess!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and wonderful. The service on the other hand was horrible. Our server (4010) Maria was lacking on her customer service skills. I am unsure if she was too busy with other customers or she just had a lot on her mind regardless the service was horrible. We had to ask for water and our children's drinks and still had to wait until after the food came out. At the absolute end of our meal Maria attempted to make some sort of conversation but we left feeling disappointed. I usually have nothing but great things to say about the food and service but this time it was bad -real bad! Hopefully this won't happen again :( I will for sure be back for the food -it's well worth it! Service could have been better"}
{"text":"As is typical for Mimi's, the food and service were great with very reasonable prices.  The Bacon Cheddar Burger is the best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"That's it !! On 23rd of Dec 2016 was my last time coming to Mimi's Cafe. Food to expensive for no flavor , no presentation and very dull. What happen ??  first of all, we get there wait for 10 minutes and half of the tables were empty. The greeters , where they come from? Snotty , no good mornings , welcome to Mimi's. Sat us down put the menus on the table and walked away nice huh? Well , the only thing that made us stay on our tables was the nice waitress but the food was bad. The breakfast Crepes burnt on the sides , my Cornbeef Hash Eggs Benedicts not cooked and no flavor on the hollandaise sauce. Man I still feel that bad after taste from the grease from the corn hash, the potatoes were they counted? , they just rolled around the plate 11 to 13 of the them....Très mauvaise nourriture, au revoir Mimi's Cafe."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast. The service here is really good. The prices are very reasonable and standard ."}
{"text":"Love their French toast breakfast. My husband and I have tried many other French toast meals at other restaurants but no one compares to Mimi's. We travel to come here for breakfast as often as we can. The servers are attentive and polite as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but service is a little off. I asked for a gluten free menu and the guy looked at me like I was from Mars and then said that he didn't know if they had that kind of drink. (To which I couldn't help but laugh out loud about). They were very accommodating to our kids though and the food was rather good."}
{"text":"We have eaten here dozens of times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Overall, the food is good and the staff is friendly.  This location is very well managed and the food is above average for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"My lunch buddies and I checked out Mimi's on line before we headed over. I couldn't decide whether I wanted breakfast or lunch but eventually decided to allow myself a carb-filled lunch.   I ordered the strawberry lemonade and fried zucchini to start. The lemonade was sugary goodness! The zucchini were fresh and hot and we read they were hand breaded. They came with a side of ranch and a side of marinara. They were well liked at our table.  For lunch, I ordered the pot roast sandwich with fries. Friend 1 ordered a salad with fresh fruit and chicken breast with a cup of corn chowder. Friend 2 had a chicken parm sandwich on ciabatta bread.  Friend 1's salad came with a fresh baked muffin of her choice. She chose carrot cake. When all of our food arrived, Friend 2 ordered a muffin for fear of stealing an unapproved bite of Friend 1's muffin!  My food looked SO good when it arrived. I took a BIG bite of my pot roast sandwich. Booo.... SO BLAND! No seasoning whatsoever. What did they cook their roast in? Water? Just plain water? After doctoring my sandwich with creamed horseradish and salt, it was passable. The meat was tender and warm, but that's all it had going for it. It came on a thick sourdough bun which was good, but I ended up taking most of the bun off to just eat the meat, lettuce and tomato. The french fries were crispy and hot and the ranch I dipped them in was good! I'm very picky about my ranch.  Friend 1's meal was \"eh...ok.\" She said the chicken and fruit was supposed to be on the side and not all cubed up. The corn chowder she got with her meal was tasteless. She said she didn't even taste the corn.  Friend 2's meal was \"Decent\" he said that he was starving so he just wolfed it down, but his favorite part was the fries, not the sandwich.  We suspect, due to the \"older\" crowd we were surrounded by, that the lack of seasoning and the cubed bites of fruit were for their sake.   Will we visit Mimi's again? Yes! There is SO much on the menu that it would be foolish to not try something else! I think I'll go for breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"Sevice at Mimi's Cafe has been really good. The food is so tasty and the pumpkin spice muffin is really good. The French toast and all sorts of other food is good to. I totally recommend Mimi's Cafe. The server was very kind and very good."}
{"text":"We had a fairly large group of 12 for a Saturday night dinner (last night).  Our server, Mirna, made the whole evening most enjoyable.  She took excellent care of us and was always in reach.  One of the manager's came in also frequently to check on us which was nice.  We were put in a side room where we were the only table set up so that was very special.  Food was very good to excellant as well.  Entree prices were reasonable and a good value.  I had the French beef stew which was excellent.  In all, all of us were very pleased to have a nice evening."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. The couple in the next booth brought in their Starbucks coffee. Anyone else think this is just wrong?. Some of these Snotsdale people are a bit annoying. Nancy is a great staff member. Choose her station if you have an option."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast sat at the bar and was completely turned off by the waitress and her mannerisms. First, I ordered a drink completely wrong, but she fixed it. Then I placed my order another waiter brought out my order. I ask him for a glass of water because the bar waitress was no where to be found. He told my original waitress for a glass of water she slammed it on the bar rudely. Then disappeared again. I ate an entire crepe without water. I had to ask another server. Once I finish eating she brought out the check and never ask if I wanted anything else. However the couple sitting next to me was ask if they needed anything else. I'm not sure if it was discrimination or she lacks the mannerism but it was distasteful. The location in Chandler has better service."}
{"text":"We went to Mimi's on mothers day as has been tradition for the past few years. It was the WORST experience ever. The service (our waiter) was horrible; checked on us a few times but overall very slow and didn't seem to care about his guests. The food came and was average at best. We ate and left. Then a few hours later three people in our party of six got violently ill. It was food positioning. I had to go to the hospital to be treated..it was so bad. To make matters worse I called the next day and the manager wasn't available so I went to their social media to tell my story. A day later someone from their insurance company called me to find out details. No call back from Mimi's, just their insurance company. That type of a call off of the complaint would lead me to believe this was not isolated to our party. STAY AWAY from this dump at all costs! So many better, cleaner, and SAFER restaurants close by."}
{"text":"Had a really enjoyable time here 2night, my dinner d8 & I had a business dinner w/ a dear friend & were pretty impressed w / the amazing food & service in a quaint little atmosphere. Surroundings did sometimes get pretty loud from other patrons (even when not Happy Hour) but their blender or whatever it was put that 2 shame w/ ear~bleeding screechiness . Seriously, it's dead, get a new 1 already! Really, the only reason they're getting 4 instead of 5 as we had 2 b subjected 2 it about 3 Xs tho coulda been worse since we were there 4 a few hrs, but dang EARPLUGS any1?     We were seated @ a booth & happily greeted by our w8tress who started us off w/ our drink orders. Unsweetened raspberry tea 4 me, the guys got sodas. Shortly after placing our orders we were presented w/ a bread basket which had adorable mini sz looking french bread loaves & a darker bread which had walnuts (not sure what else) but was delicious!      I went w/ the Les Artichoke Frites (fried artichoke hearts w/ a very complimentary aioli sauce) & a bowl of tomato/basil soup. My dinner d8 had the grilled Salmon w/ french Lentils & our business friend had the Signature Bouillabaisse which is a traditional Provençal~seasoned soup w/ mussels, shrimp & scallops simmered in white wine w/ potatoes & tomatoes served with garlic French baguette croutons. They finished w/ a decadent Creme Brulee Cheescake  By all accounts, EVERYTHING WAS SCRUMPTIOUS & it being my 1st time here will certainly consider returning!! But perhaps a different locale, unless earplugs r needed @ other 1's 2..."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back to this place and it wasn't that impressive. I mean the restaurant is a fine place and it's cozy and all but the food and the service have to meet the bill. I had the French pot roast for the first time. I liked the flavor and it was savory so it hit the spot. My wife had the avocado burger that she liked. We had my little nephew with us who ate a side of fries that were actually really good. The problem I had was the service. We had to ask someone for our place settings and silverware. Our waitress forgot to bring our bread basket. So we got our bread after our meal came. I asked for a refill of water that never came. We decided to order the pumpkin cheesecake so I had to wave the waitress down to get her attention. The cheesecake was terrible! We couldn't eat more then the first bite. I would not recommend the cheesecake. Buy the coffee was actually pretty good. I hope this review helps."}
{"text":"They recently added a gluten free menu.  It has a list of the items off the regular menu that are gluten free,  for example the potato cake Benedict.  It was perfect.  They still don't have gluten free bread but in time Mimi's Cafe will catch on."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, for what it is.  Fine dining?  No.  But neither is it fast food.  We were advised to get soup.  \"You don't have to look to find the clams,\" the waiter said when asked about the New England chowder.  My husband took his recommendation and agreed, \"plenty of clams, and good!\"  I started with French onion soup, which I enjoyed.  That, coupled with the generous bread basket would have been enough.  (The basket contained banana bread, crispy rolls and other tasty treats.)  Since we ordered the three course special -- a deal @ $13.99 -- I'll keep going: my entree of grilled salmon with spinach and little potatoes, was very nice.  I'm glad I asked for the sauce on the side, which I tasted, but never used.   T. had a combination of pasta with little shrimps and scallops -- somewhat overcooked, but I noticed he ate the whole thing.  The third course was dessert:  a choice of brownie a la mode, apple crisp also with ice cream, or bread pudding.  The apple crisp was great, as was the bread pudding, neither of which we finished.  We were full!   I don't live in Vegas, but if I ever came across another branch of Mimi's -- I understand it's a chain -- I would certainly go in."}
{"text":"I had not been to Mimi's in over a year. My sister wanted to go for lunch.  We were greeted right away and taken to a table of our choice. Our server Jonathan was a charming young man. Very patient as we could not decide on what to have for lunch.  I chose the corn chowder soup and the chicken piccata. They were both delicious. I had the soup as my sister recommended it. It was so good. I had never had it before. The chicken piccata was grilled and that was a nice change from the usual breaded or flour dredged.  My sister had the quiche and soup and hers was great as well.  No one was rushed us when we were done. it was a really enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"I won't ever go back. The food wasn't very good, nor was the service. But, the worst part about my experience was how dirty the place is! I had to ask my server to remove the sugar packets holder from the table because of how dirty it was. The salt & pepper shakers, same thing. Totally gross! The floors haven't been cleaned in some time as well. I'm not usually skeeved out too easily, but ICK!!! Shame on them!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Mimi's and I was rather hesitant after reading other reviews. My experience was pretty good. The decor was nice (had a New Orleans vib) and the staff was friendly.  When were first arrived there was no one at the host stand and had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to arrive. They first tried to seat our group of 7 at a booth made for about 5-6. We requested another table and were told it would be about another 10 minutes to get it ready. Once we were seated the waitress arrived quickly and was very friendly. She got us drinks and blueberry muffins which were amazing. They were light and fluffy and were a pretty good size.  The entrees were average. I ordered the grilled salmon with spinach and roasted potates. The piece of salmon was a great size for the price ($12) on a nice bed of spinach. My only complant about the potatoes were that some were still hard in the middle while others fell apart but they did have a great flavor. However, the sauce that the dish came with was horrible. My boyfriend and I couldn't place the taste but both agreed the dish would be better without it.  At the end of the meal the waitress cleared our plates and said she'd be right back with the check. About 10 minutes later she still wasn't back. We could see her busing and running food to other tables and talking to people in the kitchen so we were confused as to why we fell to the bottom of the priority list.  I would go back to Mimi's for the atmosphere and to try other items on the menu. Definetly a good place for a cheep date night."}
{"text":"This is my first Mimi's experience.  The wait staff is wonderful.  The French Onion Soup was fine, no complaints, not exceptional, but few are.  The dinner itself was stepping back to yesterday.  When I told the wait staff that the Brussels sprouts were not eatable she w as happy to get me fresh or exchange for another veritable.  The potato gratin was 1960-80 in texture and taste. The stake needed more seasoning, but I prefer less then to much, a thin stake is very hard to cook medium rare, but this was cooked perfectly.  The sauce I shall not comment on there is so little that can be said.  Would I come back, yes.  On one dish is not enough to say if Mimi's is average or above the rest.  I will try them again.  Their deserts look sinful, trying NOT to try one.........         Maybe take something home."}
{"text":"Typical grandma-grandpa diner. Weird menu with all sorts of cuisines, not the best cooking, overpriced for what they offer. The only menu worth trying is their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"One star may be too high. After waiting approximately 50 minutes, my wife and I got up to leave. No food, people came in after us got served first, and even the waitress was very nervous as to why it hadn't come up yet. As we were leaving, the food suddenly came out. We sat back down to eat and the manager came up to talk to us. She was sorry , said something about a new cook, etc... our food was mediocre at best. The manager came back to ask us to come back again and paid for our meals. We said probably not but she gave us 2 10 gift cards and pleaded for us to give them another try. If the food had been really good we might have, but it really wasn't. That was only the 2nd time I have ever walked out of a restaurant; the first was 55 years ago in W.Va. at a burger place. We can NOT recommend this particular place; maybe it was an off day but I am not willing to spend my time and money to find out."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and was extremely surprised.  The menu was simple and everything looked very appetizing.  The food is especially good for those who are looking to eat a little healthier and clean. When our food came out it was indeed delicious and I was very happy with my decision. The service was great and the waiter was very attentive.  Overall I was very pleased with Mimi's Cafe and I would definitely go back again and try their breakfast specials.  A must go if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first visit to Mimi's Cafe was awesome, but I am becoming less and less impressed each time I go.  Some of the entrees I have ordered lately have been very basic and bland. The bread that you get before the main course comes is really good though, but my meals on the whole have been average at best. Their prices aren't very good considering the food is just OK."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Very friendly.  I had eggs benedict and wasn't a big fan of their hollandaise sauce.  Overall food was good but average"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very friendly service. I like the menu and the good fresh food. It is one of my  favorite restaurants here in town."}
{"text":"A Thursday night, placed an order online for two sandwiches and two cups of soup. Order was place at 7:19. I was given a 20 minute lead time of 7:39 when the food would be ready for pickup. I arrived at 7:40 and walked straight to the to-go pick up register. The place was pretty dead, probably around 10-15 customers there total. I was helped by the guy standing near the door, told him I had a pick-up, and he walked in the back to take of my order. I stood there an waited for 12 minutes before he came out with my food. I was furious but cool. I asked him if they had happened to start my food order when I walked in. He told me a bogus story, that the cooks had messed up my order and thought it was dine-in and not to-go, and had to move my order into to-go containers. I called him on his bogus story, asked him what was the point of placing an on-line order if Mimi's Cafe did not start making my food until the moment I got there. He did nothing to fix the situation, or apologize for their obvious mistake. The time of me paying for my order was 7:52, I found this to be unacceptable. I would understand if the place was busy, but it was dead. Furthermore, I was not impressed by the small amount of food they give you for the price you pay."}
{"text":"So sad that this restaurant has come to this but we were waiting at the hostess stand for 8 minutes and there was two older ladies in front waiting to be seated. After the 8 minutes I went to look for a worker and found a server and asked if someone could seat the lady's and my family. Sever found the manager and he stormed up front and slammed the patio door open that it hit the patio chair that it was so loud it woke my sleeping baby. He was very rude to the older ladies and threw the menus down. After we witnessed this and my baby was crying we left. The manager looks like he was having a bad day and was not very well presented for a manger. Tattoos and he looks strung out. Hopefully the owner reads this and cleans out the bad seeds so he doesn't have a restaurant that fails."}
{"text":"Was there just before the remodel and thought the food just okay. It was 7:00 pm and we were the only ones in the front dining area. The waiter was nice but not as attentive as we would have expected since there was no one else there. Not somewhere I would choose to go to again."}
{"text":"Soo ive been here before and spoke highly of this place so i decided to suggest it for my friends get together we got there and the host was really friendly and informed us there was a 10 minute wait to be seated we said okay and took a seat. Well 15 min later we got our table yay! So we kind of already had time to look over the menu in the front our waiter came and took our drink order and then said she would be back with drinks and bread to snack while we get our food. Then we put in our order a steak and two turkey sandwiches, 30 minutes later she came back and told us they didnt have the bread for our sandwiches if we wanted to get a different sandwich or something completely different i said if they can make the same sandwich just different bread she said oh okay yes left ( and yet no bread yet that she said would come with the drinks ) . Then 15 min later she came back and said that what they didnt have the turkey. By this time we started getting irritated so we ordered something else mean while a table that got there after us and was a bigger group was already getting there meals we gave it 20 min more and decided to leave what a terrible first impression mimis made on my friends ill definitely recommend not to come here !"}
{"text":"I love Mimi's- usually- today we got there at 2 pm and waited 50 minutes for our food! Then when the food came my salmon was missing the Dijon sauce after I specially asked for it- man,  any other Mimi's is better then this one- we only went because it is closer to the house- next time we will drive. The tables around us had similar issues- can't blame the waitress- management and the kitchen need to get their crap together."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and everything was great.  I've had both lunch and dinner and only had one problem with lunch.  The manager responded quickly and rectified the problem even giving me one to go."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner tonight.  The waitress seemed a bit scattered but was so nice we really didn't care.  I had the Chicken Parmigiana and was it HUGE.  We have enough for 2 more meals.  We don't come here often, but always enjoy it when we do."}
{"text":"Great service, take out is fast and very delicious. May favorite place for breakfast, brunch and light dinners! Healthy selections too!"}
{"text":"It's been sad experiencing the decline of this adorable restaurant I used to love. I've never waited long for a table, and the service is always great, but that's not enough to save it from its food quality issues. Sauces and breads used to be Mimi's forte--now it's margarine instead of butter, salty instant gravy, and the bread is bland and tough. I miss the freshly made bread most of all. I don't care that the portions are much smaller, but the prices went up and the menu selection reduced to 2 pages. The nail on the coffin was my $12 Mediterranean Roast Chicken Salad, served tonight with half the ingredients missing; no chicken, no bacon, no red peppers, no cucumbers--basically just lettuce, onion, and olives. Next time I'll go to Cheesecake Factory and get food as advertised and twice the portion for the price."}
{"text":"I don't have a whole lot to contribute here, but thought I should write the review anyway.  Just good standard quality food.  Much better than the chain diners, but I've yet to have anything that made me stop and think of a review description.  In summary, if you want a good soup or sandwich, and there's a Mimi's nearby, you know you're safe."}
{"text":"On a Sunday brunch, the wait time wasn't too bad. My bf and I were seating after a good ten minute wait. We already knew what we wanted so we ordered with our server right away.  After she came back with our drink order, I ordered an additional appetizer of fried zucchini. She said the appetizer is only four pieces and I was okay with that.  My plate {croissant breakfast sandwich} with fresh fruit on the side looked very only. I could have made this sandwich at home and made it more appetizing to eat. Not worth the price. The glasses that my grapefruit juice came in was very dirty. The hard water marks were stained on the glass... My bf finished his breakfast of cornbeef hash Benedict and he asked me if I ordered my fried zucchini. I said I had but at this point I didn't want it anymore.. So he pulled the waitress over to our table and cancelled our order and her response was that she will definitely cancel it and remove it from our bill when he and I both knew that she just had forgotten to put them in..  The food was alright.. Service was sub par. If I do give this place another try, I'll definitely order something else other than a croissant sandwich."}
{"text":"I frequent Mimi's and I think the breakfast food here is great! Only have to always remind the server that I don't eat pork, even after order turkey links. Other than that, this is my go to spot for breakfast! Great food!  FYI, they don't have a vegan menu, but be creative, the chefs there will do all sorts of things with fruit and vegetables to make your visit equally amazing! Tu the potatoes with mushrooms, onions and peppers - vegans will love it!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were going there for a late lunch.  We had my 3 month old daughter with us in her stroller.  The hostess kept sitting people, who walked in after us, before us.  After waiting for 20 minutes (with lots of empty tables for us to sit at) we left.  Hostess was very rude, she kept talking to other waitresses and as we were leaving, they didn't even open the door for us to leave or even acknowledge that we were leaving.  She didn't care that we were leaving.  On top of that, the seating area was dirty, the tables and menus that were on the tables were all sticky.  I FELT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, JUST BECAUSE WE HAD A STROLLER!"}
{"text":"Whatever you don't do it. Food was seriously cold and took way too long (like 45 minutes) and the restaurant was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Mimi's Cafe.   As a staple for breakfast in Desert Ridge Marketplace, Mimi's cafe has remained open since the opening of the mall back in the early 2000's. With its \"French flair\" and relaxed ambiance, it's no surprise that it has thrived for so long. But once you step away from the hustle and bustle of breakfast, it is a different world.   This evening we chose to eat at Mimi's due to the quiet environment and typically good food. But for a while now, we have noticed the service continue to decline. We started the night off with simply order 1 wine and 1 water. And it would seem our waitress wasn't paying attention as she brought multiple waters and a wine, even after asking and getting a no response for the second water. When she brought the drinks back we wanted to take our order with a chicken pot pie with a side of French onion soup and a cordon bleu sandwich with a side of soup instead of fries, no lettuce or tomato. After we ordered our meal, we would typically expect bread and butter to be brought and our soups to be brought before hand, which was confirmed by our waitress yet again... instead our waitress disappeared, there was no bread and no soup. 15 minutes later we received our meal which included he cordon bleu and soup (WITH lettuce and tomato) and a pot pie (NO SOUP)  not only was the meal delivered by the manager, but our waitress continued with her absence and came out acting like she'd been running around and asked if we wanted our soup... we said no and continued on our meal very quiet and done with this meal.   Now while we are typically understanding people due to having worked in the restaurant industry. We cannot overlook the incompetence of the manager walking around and ignoring his upset customers. The waitress of course may have had other customers that we did not see, and that is not her fault it is ours, but we definitely believe that there should have been more done by the staff when there is customers that are upset.  After eating at Mimi's this evening, I know we may not be headed back anytime soon due to their poor customer service, that has only gotten worse as time has gone by. Unless they improve soon, breakfast may not be enough to be keeping Mimi's open for much longer."}
{"text":"Loved this restuarant! Never been to one before and this one is really great. Our waiter was so pleasant and helpful, and the food blew my socks off! Will definitely be coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Ended up at this Mimi's Cafe while on business in Phoenix.  I remember liking Mimi's Cafe since they're all over Los Angeles, but it's been awhile since stepping into one.  With all the various coffee shops and new establishments customers now have when wanting breakfast, Mimi's will need to up their game.  Interior appears old fashioned and the food isn't that good.  Eggs and breakfast meats were greasy, tasteless and accompanied by soggy bread even when it came toasted.  Muffins are still rather moist and good so perhaps that with a cup of coffee might be your best bet.  Service was okay but perhaps when needing a breakfast location, especially to discuss business, I'll opt for an overall better place."}
{"text":"Great service, really good choice of lunches and very accommodating for small business groups.  The staff is personable and the location is very convenient.  Overall, a pleasure.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location.  I use to go here a lot when I lived in California.  The food was very good as well as the service.  I had a turkey sandwich with French onion soup plus fries.  The soup was awesome as well as the sandwich.  Great portion size.  My only complaint is the prices are really high.  A sandwich and fries plus a cup of soup was 19.50.  That is at least $6 above normal but the quality was good."}
{"text":"What happened to Mimi's? :(  Came here on a Friday night & it was not as packed as I remember. Let me start by saying we loved our server though. She was very accommodating and apologetic for what I'm about to write.   I opted for the Roasted Chicken & Frites for dinner. The bread basket came. Looked different but still the same carrot bread (now shaped like a Madeleine) and regular bread, which was pretty hard (I couldn't even eat it).   The server came and said that they don't have Roasted Chicken. So I ordered the Under the Brick Chicken that I saw was plastered on their posters and menus. Few minutes later, she comes back again and says they have no chicken whatsoever, so I had to change my order as well as my mom who ordered Chicken & Waffles.  It's Friday night, pretty empty place, no damn chicken. Your menu is filled with chicken dishes! I'm so disappointed. We opted for Pot Roast instead and Steak and they were delicious but how can you not have any freaking chicken?!   Sorry Mimi's. This will probably be the last time."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and ordered the Reuben based on Denise's recommendation...I was very satisfied with the sandwich however the fries tasted like they were reheated in a microwave....and they looked so good too!  I love my fries crispy and that's how they appeared but once I picked them up it was a whole different story!  Denise's service was phenomenal and was johnny-on-the-spot if I needed anything.  I will be back but next time I will have to try a different side...  :/"}
{"text":"Service is good, food was just meh, presentation definitely could have been better."}
{"text":"It's a chain. You know what you're getting. So why write a review? Because they massively screwed up...And management made it right. First let me point out that getting between me and food is not advisable for your health. So when we got sat and waited for over 30 mins for a non-existent server, watching others get seated, brought coffee, orders taken and food served, I was pissed. Like \"I came here for food and you're not feeding me\" pissed.   I went up to the podium, politely asked for a manager, and while the hostess was busy blowing me off, the manager jumped in with \"We'll take care of it.\" She came over and took our drink order, took our food order, got everything out to us super-quickly, and even comped us a bit. So we walked out of there satisfied with both the food and the service. That takes talent. Nicely done."}
{"text":"service is ok. food is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast. chamomile tea is the best.  good luck."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late breakfast on a Saturday. We did not have to wait for a table and the service from Alaina was impeccable. She is a real gem in the world of waitstaff. It's so nice to find someone that enjoys what they do and understands how important it is. She knows the restaurant business well and she loves what she does. It shows in her kindness and knowledge. We will definitely go back to this location. It was worth the drive and the food was fabulous. We always have \"special\" orders and it was perfect. No problems at all and Alaina was very gracious when taking our orders."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner at Mimi's and there were absolutely no complaints.  This is unusual for this group who look for negatives.  Everything was outstanding.  The warmth and cordiality stood out instantly, and the food was perfect.  I don't know how to keep praising the experience that we had - you just have to go and see for yourself.  You'll be delighted. Mike Fefferman"}
{"text":"I still like Mimi's and had a good experience there yesterday for an early lunch but just 2 quick observations about how this location is run. Half the restaurant was empty yet they still had a wait to be seated and then they did most of their seating in the loudest most closed in room of the restaurant. This is obviously a reflection on the mngt here and the lack of enough wait staff. My favorite area is the street side open window area and it seems this is the last place they seat or open up. Why? Hire some staff and improve your service Mimi's.    Second: When strawberry is in the title of the dish then it should feature prominately on that or in that dish. I had the strawberry-walnut salad and it was excellent except it had a total of 3 small half strawberries on it. Really? C'mon......how does the kitchen or the wait person allow a Strawberry-walnut salad to be served with 3 half strawberries. Please re-name this dish the Search-for-the-strawberries-walnut salad."}
{"text":"Two of us stopped for breakfast on a Sunday morning around 8am. No waiting, we walked right in and were seated right away. The restaurant was not full but still seamed shorthanded with servers. Ours took about 15 minutes to greet us and provide menus and another 10 to come back for our orders.   Typical chain-restaurant quality; mediocre for what you pay for. The cheapest thing on the menu was a simple 2 egg/ham breakfast and it was still $11+. My husband ordered eggs benedict and the eggs were prepared just right. The hollandaise was bland but the orange juice tasted fresh squeezed.  On a side note, the restrooms were among the cleanest I have seen at any restaurant.  Overall, it was an average meal, but in a place like Scottsdale with so many restaurants to choose from that are not part of a large conglomerate of chain restaurants, we will definitely go elsewhere the next time we have a breakfast craving."}
{"text":"Best French toast I've had in a long time!! Perfectly made without being over complicated. I wish I would've taken a picture. Next time as there will be definitely be a next time oh and the roasted potatoes, scrambled cheese eggs and turkey sausage was perfect too!"}
{"text":"Food is average, nothing special. Muffins are good.$3.29 for coffee and iced tea a little pricey. BOGO coupons are helpful."}
{"text":"Quality service and great food.  Recommend Mimi's Cafe for your dining experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday (9/30) on the way hope from a long trip.  Wished we'd have kept going.  The place was literally empty so we figured the service would be good and the food tasty.  I ordered a bacon avacado cheese burger which was a huge dissapointment.  Seemed to take a while to get to the table (even with a near empty restaurant) and when it did the fries that accompanied it were burnt (some even black) and shrivelled up.  In other words the dregs that had been setting around for a while and they were cold.  The server seemed embarrased and said he was going to bring fresh fries but he never returned with them.  If he was that embarrassed he should have never brought them in the first place!!!!  The burger was somewhat tastless and it wasn't even luke warm.  Have been to other Mimi's so this should have been a good bet.  NOT!  Doubt I'll never return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I actually first learned about Mimi's after going to the location out in Henderson, but this locaiton has been my choice ever since.    Food is great, service is outstanding!  I've actually never been for breakfast, and after reading reviews of some of my fellow Yelpers, I will have to do just that next time around.  This is one of the places that I bring \"non-locals\" for something different.  They are opening another location, off of Rainbow and 215.  Being my part of town, this makes me very excited!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a Mimi's Cafe in California & it was very appetizing, but this location was not the greatest. I would NOT RECOMMEND for anyone to eat here.  I went here for dinner and the first thing I noticed was our silverware was dirty and we also were not given napkins. We switched it out with another table's silverware because our waitstaff was nowhere to be found, even though the restaurant had about 6 families in our area.    When my family and I were ordering, the items we wanted to order were apparently \"Sold out.\" I have never been to a restaurant that had most of their main course items \"sold out.\" This was already a bad sign for us.   We ended up ordering a spinach dip for our appetizer which was probably the best thing we had all night. It was rated a 3/5. The taste was decent, but it was so watery it didn't really look like a spinach dip. I ordered the grilled chicken and frites which was 2/5. There was way too much butter you could see it oozing off of the plate. The frites had a very bland taste and there was only one small piece of chicken. One of my family members ordered the meat loaf and mash which was a 0/5. The meatloaf had a weird tangy taste and it also tasted old. The mash was also very bland. My other family member ordered the chicken Tillamook Cheddar Mac which would be a 1/5. It also had a weird taste that was not appetizing.  The upside was our food came quickly and the check came shortly after."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Jessica was our server and was amazing, along a couple of amazing people who came by to see how we were doing and if we needed anything else! Must say we will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious and waitress was awesome I had the steak and eggs. Food came fast and hot. First time coming but I will definitely  return"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here two weeks ago.  The service and food were just OK.  One waiter took our order and a few minutes later, another waiter came and wanted to take our order.  We got a big kick out of them not know what the other was doing.  Other than that, it was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Yep, this a chain, but the food is consistently great, and I have lived on their French Onion soup and dipped beef sandwiches for over three decades.  Clean, happy waitstaff, and attentive service.  I wish more chains could follow their model."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with this place... The wait for service  is great but the service is OK. Not great. Last time we went I had a drink spilled on my table by the waitress, which I understand things happen, but she didn't wipe it down all the way and didn't get us some napkins so i could at least clean it off. I understand things happen so I will definitely come back and give it another shot. As far as the food goes, my steak was a bit tough and dry but that was probably my fault for ordering it well done lol."}
{"text":"Love the Corn Chowder some of the best I have ever had. Their french toast and other breakfast options are fantastic to!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, been here a lot! But tonight I received my meal with raw chicken, I asked to have it remade which they did. However the rest of my dinner party was finished with their diners by the time I received mine. :( Then they only apologized, normally the restaurant would comp the dinner due to their error. Not here, sad Mimi's you knocked yourself down a notch as far as I'm concerned... careful when you order the chicken!"}
{"text":"In the past I have loved mimis Cafe mainly because the consistency in their food and Staffing. Saddens me to have a French dip that felt like it pretty chewed. Our waitress was terrible and had some attitude that she carried with her. I was a server at Mimi's and I know there regulations. The server never checked with us again to see how our food was and continue with the rude Behavior. I rarely never leave a tip but this time I did not. Would have mentioned something to the manager that was nowhere to be seen."}
{"text":"Sat down for lunch with hubby then about 20-25 minutes later the server came and asked for our drink order. We explained that we were ready to order everything and she said she did not have time to take our order......ummmmm. So another 15 minutes went by and she came back with our drinks dropped them on the table and ran. Maybe she was the only server in the whole place? Who knows. We got up and left.  We have eaten lunch here one other time and it was \"ok\" but we both got salads. Thus the two stars. Otherwise it would get one star. This chain restaurant is kinda like an 80's cafeteria food place."}
{"text":"So it was my first time to the Metro Park area, and my first time at Mimi's Cafe...  and I must admit that for a chain, this place is just great!  We sat on the patio, I had the \"Chicken, Fruit, and Baby Greens Salad\" and it came with one of the best spiced muffins I ever had!  The salad was DELICIOUS. I mean like top 5 salads of my life.  Like way up there. Every bite was a little different, very fresh, perfect amount of fruit and feta cheese. Wow. I loved it.  My boyfriend had the Tuna Salad Sandwich and wasn't a RAVING fan, but he still liked it.  Our server was Kimberly, and she was cute and really great. She understood my frustration with the Strawberry Lemonade (WAYYY too sweet!) and recommended a delish Arnold Palmer.    Last, we told our server that it was our first time to a Mimi's, and she brought us a free sampling of muffins for us to try!!! I mean like an entire box of huge, complimentary muffins.  I don't think a simple Sunday lunch could have gotten better!"}
{"text":"The service was great! She was extremely friendly and regularly checked up on us. We finished our meal before our drinks and she ensured us that we could take our time. The pancakes were so fluffy and delicious that I am kicking myself for sharing."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service my family and I experienced was horrible.  Everyone received their meals correctly and in a timely fashion except me.  I had to remind the waitress about the salad I ordered after waiting at least 15 minutes, then had to wait some more for them to prepare it.  Also, after everyone else's meals were delivered, she made no mention of my meal - instead one of the managers came over to let me know that they are just making my meal because the ticket for it \"got lost\".  Sounds like to me she forgot to enter it!  Then what really put me over the edge is he didn't offer anything to me to remedy it after I told him that I was pretty upset.  What kind of establishment is this!  In my experience, they at least offer to comp your meal or give you a free dessert.    I'm not sure I will ever go back because of this."}
{"text":"I love the food...however service here is horrible. Outright Horrible.  I have been working in this area for the past 7 months and not 1 time out of 7 was eithe my order ready or complete/correct. Yesterday I told a co-worker I would give them 1 last chance and place my order 1.5 hour in advance to the to go optin online. Guess what.....didn't get the right dressing, salad looked curly and old and there was no soup with my order.  A manager had to come out to swipe his card to see my order and yet they didnt realize my order wasn't correct. I wanted to order online for convenience, as I have only a 30 minute break. drive out, pay, grab food and leave. No EVERYTIME my food still needs to get ready. 2 weeks ago my soup dropped on the floor, but the carry carton wasn't folded correctly, the time before that my soad was spilled all over my food, because of the same reason. They rush, rush and don't pay attention to their customers. Back in March I had 1 hour lunch, sat down with 2 co-worker, no one came up to us for 20 minutes, we left our table to order to go. it took them an other 10 minutes to notice us. A'manager' came rushing by to apologize ' to be oh so sorry, here have some free muffins' and left. 15 minutes later, they didnt know how to swipe our cards, but the 'manager' kept looking in our direction, but didn't take any actions, I guess muffins do for any mess up. When I filled out the online questionaire for free muffins and I gave them 1's, it disconnected me and no code. I will not recommend them to any of my friends. I will NOT go bacck here for my lunch.  1 mess up can be forgiven, but 6 out of 7 (!!!) NO, NO. I am done.  I heard Jason's deli across the street has great salads......."}
{"text":"Food at Mimi's is always good. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Omelet for the first time.  It was delicious though a little bland.  I like it that way but some may want salt & pepper.  I love their bran muffin."}
{"text":"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.  Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.  Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.  I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with \"seasonal vegetables\" and \"homemade mashed potatoes\".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My \"homemade\" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress \"the problem\" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.  After all this, they sincerely asked us if \"everything was all right\" and \"would we care to order dessert\".  At least they have a sense of humor.  Never again."}
{"text":"I ate here last year and I remember the food being good, and the menu as diverse with a Southern influence. Tonight, the food sucked pretty bad. My daughter's chicken parmesan was dry and overcooked, and the pasta was dry. My food was ok. The beneighs tasted as if they hadn't changed the grease is a while. I was really disappointed. They comp'ed my daughters dinner and sent us home with a 6 pack of muffins. Would not go back. The mistakes made were too egregious."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time Thursday with my best friend her daughter and her son and I got to say that this place didn't disappoint the food was delicious I got the omelet with cheese and ham and 4 pancakes along with hot chocolate it was really good and exceeded my expectations as I thought it wouldn't taste that good the service was really good although they did take a little bit longer to get our food and take our orders overall this place isn't too bad it's top notches above ihop and dennys and that is saying a whole lot overall I think I will check this place out again when I get the chance."}
{"text":"I only gave  this a  5 star rating because of my server Karen was awesome and on the spot she was happy to  answer any questions  that  i had about the menu and I enjoyed my meal even though it was  way over priced for what i received , had a coupon and the  supervisor acted like she  was put out because she had to move to do something and her public relations skills  are something to be desired as well , no hello good morning  nothing  just an ok and walked away.  Thank God Karen didn't  have the same attitude  her supervisor had  it's because of Karen i would come back to eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and the service is always on par. A great go-to for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Went to enjoy a nice breakfast just to be ignored. We were seated and never got any acknowledgement. Several parties came in after us and were seated and served immediately. Still no one said two words to us. We got up to leave and the manager asked us if we had a question. I told her what was going on and said we were leaving. Her response was ok; nothing else. No care in the world that we were upset and that we had not been served. Told the hostess on the way out and she didn't care either. Very disrespectful and rude. Very unhappy and disappointed."}
{"text":"I was saddened when they were closing Mimi's Cafes across the Valley, but honestly now I think they could have closed at least one more. I'm a very positive person and it's hard for me to not find something good to say, but maybe this is my Waterloo. Worst ever dining experience at this price level ($32 for two pancake meals). I was excited to see that along with the standard bacon, sausage and ham options, I was able to get corned beef brisket for $1 more. Unfortunately, it was actually corn beef hash, which was incredibly bland. More about that in a bit. The first thing I noticed was one of the 3 pancakes was missing about a third of the pancake, which i thought was probably an indicator of poor quality control, but I let it slide. But since it was the bottom pancake it felt like a literal \"cover-up\" of a mistake. I took a bite and they were undercooked, too. The second bite was better, but they were just on the edge of cooked. The fresh fruit was, indeed, fresh, and quite tasty, so there is something good to say after all, which makes me feel better about giving them a star. Unfortunately, they could have earned at least one more star, but our waiter blew it. I was unable to finish more than about 3 bites of the \"brisket\" because I really didn't want to eat potatoes and there just wasn't enough appeal in the flavor to bother. It gave me the impression of a rushed prep. The potatoes had some onion in them, but neither potato nor onions were cooked long enough to bring out the flavor.  So I asked the waiter for a menu to make sure I was correct about my brisket versus hash understanding, and when I read brisket and told the waiter that hash wasn't brisket, he agreed. He offered to get me another item, but when I declined and said we were just going to be done with the meal, he did nothing else, not even apologize. And then the bill still had the extra buck for the misadvertised brisket. Really?? Yes, really. I delayed getting out my credit card, thinking maybe he was going to swing by and at least offer SOMETHING for the obvious dissatisfaction, but no. Obviously they wanted us to experience every detail of the stereotypical French cafe dining experience, including a supercilious waiter. It was the first ever time that I did not leave a tip. It was also my last ever trip to Mimi's."}
{"text":"Last time I tried the chicken fried steak it was so-so and I was disappointed.  So this time, I decided to have the Crab Cake Florentine Benedict and that is now my current favorite.  I love everything about it. The cakes never taste fishy, the eggs are poached to perfection and the spinach is cooked perfectly.  Their pan fries are good, old-fashioned pan fries - chunks of boiled potatoes browned perfectly.  My husband usually has an omelet and they never fail to impress.  Good breakfasts for sure."}
{"text":"It was a nice evening and they have an outdoor patio, so I did not mind sitting outside until everyone outside started to get attacked by pigeons. I didn't even notice the bird poop that was on some of the tables until this attack started to happen. At that point, I decided to get a seat inside the restaurant along with the few others that sat outside. Everyone was surprised that the staff didn't even go out to clean the tables outside, the food out there just kept attracting birds and some were even attacking each other.  I've ordered take out several times from here and didn't disappoint, but after this (the first time)  it might be the last time I do eat there."}
{"text":"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF DINING AT Mimi's Cafe & Bistro: 1.  Thou shall not get upset when the restaurant is half empty on a Saturday night but they take your name in the front of the restaurant and have you wait 9 minutes while you are staring at empty tables.   2.  Thou shalt not expect to be given a lipstick-free beer glass. Thou shalt expect the waitress to tell you these are water spots and not lipstick. (Are there red water spots?) 3.  Thou shalt not expect to be given small dishes to put your bread on. Thou shalt expect the waitress to slam them down when she finally brings them to you two at a time so you can do her job and pass the dish to the other diner. 4.  Thou shalt expect the waitress to be shocked when you ask her  if your \"steak & frites\" comes with a peppercorn sauce.  \"A SAUCE ON STEAK?????\" (Yes, just like in Paris. Isn't this a French-themed restaurant?) 5.  Thou shalt not expect your \"frites\" to be fried extra crispy as you requested and instead you receive them \"al dente\".   6.  Thou shalt not expect your waitress to be available for an extended period of time.  When you finally get another staffer to get your waitress, you could hear her from the kitchen asking: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT?  7.  Thou shalt not expect to be given a choice when you order tea.  Thou shalt expect the waitress to make the decision for you. 8. Thou shalt expect to be given a teapot with a broken top so that the steam coming out of the hole can keep you alert and on your toes. 9.Thou shalt not expect to receive a ballpoint pen with ink in it to indicate a tip and sign your bill.   10.  Thou shalt not be lured by BOGO (with purchase of two beverages) coupons to get a \"FREE\" meal at Mimi\"s.    FREE IS NOT FREE when you can't enjoy a night out because of mediocre food and Abysmal service.     Au revoir pour toujours!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Service was terrible, waitress was not friendly, never came back to see if we needed anything, waited a long time to get the bill, she never came back, had to flag someone else to pay.   Now the food, it was very skimpy, piece of boneless chicken was barely 2 inches long and had no flavor, mashed potatoes must have come out of a box. This dinner came with a sundae that consisted of melted vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Had to flag down another waitress to get this as my waitress had disappeared.  The prices are very high for what you get, I have went here for the last time."}
{"text":"The wait was about an hour long, I can tell they were understaffed. Our server gave us no introduction so I cannot state her name, but the hostess was nice. We ordered an appetizer which took so long the manager took it off the bill and came to the table to apologize. The food was decent, however one of our plates was cold. The food was not worth the wait nor bad service. I will not be returning again."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe  is a good breakfast place so far the service is good, food sometimes good, sometimes some mishit. Overall Mimis Cafe is good."}
{"text":"They ruined my wife's birthday dinner.  Very slow service.  My son's steak tasted like sand (freezer burn?).  The waitress said that they are getting new steaks next week.  My daughter and I had the chicken - Dry ... She had a \"creamed corn\" which means that the corn was in a \"biscuits and gravy sauce\".  My wife had the oriental chicken salad - it was ok."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I ordered the mushroom, bacon, & brie omelette. Service was really really bad. The waitress was very nice but forgot things we asked for. We had to ask for refills. She brought out the bread basket and butter and no utensils or napkins. So we asked for utensils and napkins, she forgot and they were never brought out until after entrée arrived! Another server brought out our meals without clearing the table first. We asked her to clear our table first to make room for the food and she got snarky with us so we cleared off our own table while she stood there and watched! Then we asked for utensils again-twice. We got then finally three minutes AFTER our entree arrived. We ate bread and butter without napkins or utensils, and I had to stir my coffee with a straw. We ordered pancakes for the kids and they never brought out any syrup. We had to ask for syrup and got it 10 minutes after they got their meal. The service was really bad and we didn't know whether to laugh or be mad."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Labor Day. We weren't sure what to expect since it was a holiday. Dining room was about half full. We had a short wait only because we wanted a booth. The hostess was pleasant and seated us within five minutes.   It took a bit of time before our server came by for our drink order. She seemed harried and rigid in her demeanor. She brought our drinks, and we ordered. We ordered the Mushroom Brie Burger and the Mediteranean Salad with Roasted Chicken. The food took thirty minutes. During that time she brought a muffin that went with one of the entrees and dressing.   A food runner brought our food. She seemed really rushed. She asked if I wanted pepper on my salad. Put some on until I told her when and off she went. Problem was that my salad was wrong. Our server came by and realized as soon as she saw the salad that it wasn't the right one. She took it and with apologies said she would have it fixed. She came back shortly with the right one.  The food was good. The burger cooked correctly. The salad was delicious with pieces of artichoke, blue cheese and kalamata olives! Tender slices of chicken on top! The muffin was pumpkin with a crumble crust!   Our server checked back to see how everything tasted. She seemed more relaxed at this point, even chatting with us. The manager came by and also apologized about the salad. He also told us he would take the salad off. We told him that wasn't necessary, but he insisted.  It started out a bit rough, but ended on a good note. Our server invited us to come back for dinner some time. We were happy with everything! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I found it kind of strange that you get a muffin with your meal(we went at lunch time) but the muffin was absolutely delicious! I had a salad and they said the dressing was homemade... well I was not a fan of the dressing because it tasted odd and nothing like ranch dressing. But on the plus side the service was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Pumpkin spice muffin and eggs Benedict Florentine at mi mi's, Im in heaven  !!!!!!  Excellent service perfect food ."}
{"text":"Took the wife and oldest daughter for New Year's Eve brunch (as they have bragged about the Sunday brunch here several times but I had never been).  The atmosphere is pretty subtle, cross French chalet/old school diner.  The prices are a step up, but so is the food once you get it. We had a good half hour wait, which I'm told is not the norm, but it did buy time for a few more mimosas. I tried the French Toast with wild berries and a cream cheese spread which was great. They make the bacon to order and will get the sides to your specifications. If your on a diet, good luck, even the healthy choices are rich. The service was fairly attentive, our waiter inparticular as a few of the waitresses appeared less eager. Overall, a positive experience."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we'd been to Mimi's-- three years or so as we'd moved out of the area for a few years. We are back in the area but don't live close to it now but I was really wanting to go back so we made the 30 min drive because we used to enjoy it. I gave it a great review in fact.   Well something has changed in the last three years and not for the better.  First it was a Saturday afternoon so it wasn't busy but it took about 10 minutes to get seated. I think the hostess was helping with a carryout order but then went away for awhile after that customer left. Meanwhile other staff (including the empty bar) was roaming around past us, wiping tables, looking our way and going on by. We were literally leaving when the Hostess eventually reappeared and sat us. That wasn't a great sign but we'd driven far enough so we stayed.   After another 5 minutes an unenthusiastic waiter made his way by to say he'd be right with us. Right with us mean 8 minutes (Yes, we timed it for the hell of it). He took our order and took another 12 min to bring salads (with very little dressing).  I guess they don't do the cute little baskets of assorted breads they used to bring out before the meal.   Dry salads long gone and everyone in our section had that same weary look as we did as we waiting way too long between interactions for any service.   The food came. My husbands Fish was good, the cole slaw was good but the fries were shoe-lace soggy with grease.  My potpie was like soup broth in a bread crusted bowl. I'm used to it being a creamier texture with a merging of the flavors. It had a heavy taste of maybe a wine-base, very liquid, the chicken was in huge chunks and carrots & celery almost crunched.  It wasn't good.  We never saw waiter again after food-- no more tea or water and no offer of dessert which I had planned to get the petit sampling. But after so much time, we didn't want to wait again. We actually wanted out of there so we flagged down waiter and gave him our card before we even got the check just so we wouldn't have to wait again.   Slow/poor service, mediocre food for a total of 48 dollars for what was an hour + lunch was enough for me to give up on Mimi's."}
{"text":"A trendy little eat spot located in the busy area of Henderson.  There is something for everyone on the menu.  Seems it is always busy and your looking a 10 -15 minute wait during the busy times of the days.  It's convenient.  The foods not bad but for some reason I feel guilty (like I am eating at Denny's) when I dine here.  I should be out exploring or supporting local business."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants I have been to, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was terrible! I ordered the Mediterranean salad ($8.99) + i think $2.49 for added chicken or shrimp, and i chose blackened chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio crusted  salmon, which he described as flavorless and that the salmon tasted like a greasy piece of fish with some pistachios thrown on top. I believe it was like $13 or 14.99. My salad was small, and oddly enough it came with a freakin muffin? Not to mention the muffin was the BEST thing i tasted in there....sad,but true, the blackened chicken was the smallest little diced cubed up chicken pieces i have EVER seen, it didn't even taste as if it was blackened. The greens were wilted, and usually a $12 salad anywhere ya go is a good salad with a nice pieces of chicken cutlet, and our server was trying her  best, but came off as annoying to us unfortunately. We also ordered the appetizer of the crab fritters, i think like $5.99- and it was not great, the crab tasted old....This came off as one of those restaurants that want merely nothing but your money, the food isn't authentic whatsoever and the servers look as if they could care less..I will never be coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Wow.  I've got to update my review.  We went to Mimi's Cafe for breakfast for the first time in quite some time.  So many things have changed, and I'm not just talking about the revised, blander menu.    We went on Memorial Day, a Monday, at around 9:30 a.m.  It wasn't very busy yet, so we were seated right away (by our server, in fact; I guess there was no host on duty yet).  There were tables scattered here and there with people, but nothing significant.    Our server was great.  He was very friendly and attentive...at least until it was time for the check and he was overwhelmed with the now-crowd of diners.  It looks like the kitchen and management are where the problems lie.  For breakfast, it took wayyyyyy too long for us to get our food (between 30-45 minutes), especially when the restaurant was not yet crowded.  We never once saw a manager; nobody when we walked in or out or walking the dining room to apologize for/correct the food delays.  And, sadly, the food was just average.  Gone are the days when a Mimi's breakfast stood out from the crowd.  My ham and cheese omelet was nothing special and looked sloppily assembled.  We could/should have just gone to IHOP for better, quicker food.    On a related note, it seems the Mimi's Cafes I used to go to in Orlando have closed due to poor service and a decline in food quality.  It looks like Charlotte's is not far behind.  We won't be back.  p.s. The free wi-fi never worked for me either, which I wouldn't have noticed except we waited forever for our food."}
{"text":"We stopped by Mimi's for breakfast.  They were so nice to me and my friend!  We were given coupons and free muffins!  Please try their Corn Chowder too.  It is yum yum good!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving Dinner -- horrible service and well below average food. Management needs to do a much better job or stop offering holiday meals. Long waits even with reservation. Appears they grossly overbooked. Once we finally got seated almost an hour past our reservation time, server was very unfriendly and didn't care about the service delivered. Her first words when she finally came to the table were \"I'm running way behind.\" No \"sorry for the wait\" or \"happy Thanksgiving.\" She sported a perpetual sour-puss the entire evening even though we were incredibly friendly and never once complained about the terrible service. Had to wait incredibly long times for drinks and food. It was like pulling teeth to get her to serve us. Part of the meals were missing, we were almost finished before the missing dishes were delivered, never was offered more drinks, and only came to table three times: to take order, deliver one round of drinks and give us our check. Someone from kitchen finally delivered our food since we waited so long. Tables that were seated after us were served before us, maybe because they had more people in the party and server catered to the tables with bigger tip potential? Sorry you all were working on Thanksgiving, but that doesn't mean you have the right to ruin someone else's holiday, especially since we paid for what should have been decent food and service. Major fail Mimi's!"}
{"text":"The food was good but plate was hot. Waited a long time for our food. Did love the mimosa special.  The waiting area is nice and comfortable to wait with tables."}
{"text":"We were there mid afternoon after the lunch crowd and way before the dinner crowd.  The service was extremely slow.  When the manager finally brought our meals, we asked him for condiments which he forgot to bring. After 10 minutes I went to find our waitress and asked her to bring them.  She brought them after another ten minutes.  We had a coupon that Mimi's issued but after a long wait, she brought the check without the discount even though she had our coupon in her pocket.  After another 10 minutes and an argument with the manager, we finally got the corrected check.   The food was decent but too expensive and lastly, the manager badly needs a course in customer relations as his rudeness will certainly not bring repeat customers."}
{"text":"I used to love this chain. I remember breakfasts with my dad, and blackened chicken Caesar salads with perfectly cooked chicken and muffins for days. They've changed over the years. Service seems to have been the first thing to go. I was actually heading to The Keg tonight when I saw the familiar silhouette of Mimi's. Obviously, they are no where near similar in quality, but I was feeling sentimental and I thought I'd give them another chance. I know not everyone has had such bad history with this place, or they wouldn't be able to keep the doors open.   Unfortunately tonight was the final nail in the coffin. Server was antisocial. It seemed like my table was her kryptonite. She couldn't not wait to leave every time she stopped by. She took an absurdly long time to return. I was 3/4 done with my steak (not a true medium-rare, as hoped, but closer than most so-so restaurants have gotten ...I know I know, shame on me for ordering a steak here). Broccoli was DOA. Not a plastic surgeon in Scottsdale that could have brought the youth back to those cruciferous corpses. I enjoyed my salad (really just a handful of lettuce with a spritz of dressing) as an afterthought since it had been forgotten and she took so long to come back to check on me that Robin Williams showed up to ask \"what year is it?\". I said no croutons, but that didn't stop them! There were only 3 though, which begs the question of whether or not they forgot my request and that's just how many people are supposed to get in their opinion.   I gotta own this one. I knew better. I smothered my instincts with a pillow of denial and I paid the price.   I hate it here. You know who comes here? People who don't like food that much and who don't want to wait somewhere else for a table on a Friday night.   Goodbye, I say. Goodbye."}
{"text":"Good environment to come in and have a good meal. the servers were friendly and check on us to make sure we had everything we needed. The breakfast menu had a good variety and the all butter croissant sandwich was amazing. The fruit was really fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"Mimi's is slipping in quality.  The grilled chicken tasted like it was done on a George Forman grill.  Very tough.  The other meals by our party were at least edible, but come on, I go out to get something better than what I can heat up at home in the microwave."}
{"text":"Today was Easter. Sounded like a good day t have a ham dinner. Their brunch seemed a good value and we've eaten here many times. They may be trying to stay ahead of the crowd, but our food came out lukewarm and did not remain hot. The salads were warm and limpy. Too bad. Everything tastes good but when something is supposed to be cold...or hot...it's disappointing when it's not. Not our favorite visit to Mimi's. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"First time visit-Service was great. Food was Average-to above average.   Both my husband and I left satisfied, and would return! The breads/muffins are exceptional."}
{"text":"Okay, people:  this place is amazing.  Last night my aunts and I got the urge to ditch Olive Garden and go here instead. RIGHT DECISION.  Lo and behold they are having a secret Three Course Menu deal for $12.99 per person and $1 extra for drinks (alcohol not included).  Perfect meal:  1) Awesome bread basket they bring to your table (refill, refill, refill...). 2) Appetizer  :  Zucchini Spears 3) Entree  :  Garlic Shrimp with Butternut Squash Tortellini (has fresh tomato and basil on top - the sauce is SUPERB) 4) Dessert  :  their take on beignets (they are like custard-filled donut holes) is pretty good, but the chocolate mousse with fresh strawberry slices and drizzle is perfect and light.  Better than the deals you see anywhere else.  I don't know why anyone would EVER give this place a bad review. The service is always spot on and one of the things I love is that they don't rush you out the door, but the second your entire party has left they are cleaning the table."}
{"text":"You must try the Tillamook Chicken Mac and Cheese! It's creamy and delicious and they serve a huge portion. I love this place! They give you a free muffin if it's your first time visiting too!"}
{"text":"Ok is a good term for mimis. Have been here a few times for breakfast and it has been a decent breakfast with good size portions and decent service. Nothing to complain about good breakfast"}
{"text":"We had a great experience with breakfast. What actually prompted this review was the manager who approached our table to make sure we were doing well. The quality of the food and service (by the waitress) was also great."}
{"text":"Got stuck in the corner were we forgot about. Took another 5 minutes to get our drinks. Then the soda was flat. Took another 5 minutes for our waitress to bring no me a water in place of the soda. Meanwhile our food came while I was still waiting for my water. Potatoes were cold and the eggs were black. Was supposed to have a muffin which only came when the manager showed up. The manager was a sarcastic jerk. Won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"Rob was a great server, and the food was delicious as always. BUT!!! They say a restaurant's kitchen is only as clean as its restrooms. If that is so, I wish I had never eaten here! Walking into the restroom, there was a strong urine smell. The toilets were filthy and in desperate need of repair (or replacement). Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The wife & I have eaten here several times with her parents. Sorry, but I find the food rather mediocre and blah."}
{"text":"A service was alittle clogged for lunch but delish! Side of Fruits were warm but main plate was great."}
{"text":"Lots of scooters and oxygen tanks.  Carrot raisin muffin was good.  Red Velvet Cupcake, not so much.   Had a Lubys cafeteria feel to it.... Since I didn't want to pay for the bottled water, I got lukewarm water in a not so clean glass.  Used to be much much better. Kinda sad."}
{"text":"Love the food, but the service and kitchen staff are very inconsistent. My dad ordered the citrus salmon and it was very dry. We had to ask multiple times for my French onion soup and when it finally came, it was obvious that it had not been cooked properly. The bread was still trying to absorb the soup and the cheese was barely melted. The poor waiter was overwhelmed because they were short staffed and he had a lot of tables to deal with. We tried to speak with the manager, but she walked away annoyed and did not return.   As much as I've enjoyed my experiences here in the past, it will be a long time before I go back."}
{"text":"I really only come here for the turkey club and pesto turkey sandwiches at lunchtime, and this time I got the latter. I expected to pay maybe $7.50 for it, as there are no prices on the website or mobile app...It ended up being over 10. It came with fries.   For that price, I almost expected it to be the best turkey sandwich I ever had, and it was way short of that. I could barely taste the pesto and the whole thing needed salt! I ordered an overpriced mimosa, which the only redeeming quality to this visit was that they leave the remnants of the little champagne bottle at your table for you finish off. Service was slow, but it did seem unusually busy for a weekday at 11:30a. My drink and food came out fast, but by the time i needed to pay and get out of there, my waitress was nowhere to be seen.   I will be looking for a new place to get a turkey sandwich,lol My decision is based on first price, then service. If it had been cheap, I wouldn't have cared about the service, and if it had fantastic service, the price wouldn't have bothered me as bad.   This was my \"last straw\" visit to this place. My husband doesn't like it,which is why i went alone. I was hoping it would impress me as it had in the past, but it was ultimately a fail. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I am so surprised by the number of negative reviews.  Mimi's has always been one of our favorite restaurants since we started living in AZ.  On two occasions I was offered the meal free when asked how everything was.  I wasn't disappointed in the  food but they forgot the artichokes once in the pasta and the manager came over and apologized profusely.  they have a huge variety and you can have breakfast at night and their cobb salad and chicken pie are to die for.  Oh did I mention their muffins? I know they must have a thousand calories but they are worth it.  And the desserts are yum too if anyone had room.  Okay it's not a gourmet paradise, but Scottsdale  has those too, you have to know what Mimis is and come and enjoy it, because the staff really wants you to."}
{"text":"awesome service, great food.  Buffy was an amazing server!!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty frequently for breakfast.  Delicious goodness.  If you get a meal that comes with a muffin, it's a LOT of food.  Enough to share.  Our favorite, chocolate mousse muffin.  Deeee-lish!"}
{"text":"My first time to Mimi's...I wanted to love this place but can honestly say I was disappointed.  So granted, it's Super Bowl week and all, this location wasn't busy. A plus so far. I ordered  Quiche Florentine and the Hubs ordered sautéed sole and artichoke frites. The frites..oh em gee! They remind me of chicken nuggets minus the meat of course. I love them! Now the not so good. The wait. Mind you it was nearly empty  and we waited 45 minutes for our meal.Too long .  We almost left but the bread basket and our appetizer curbed the appetite and we made it stretch. My quiche was good, cooked well. The hubs fish wasn't  really sautéed , it was mushy to even be thought of as sautéed.  He finished it tho.  The saving grace was the artichoke frites..yum. I want to like this place, really. I want to come back because it's inviting and on Sunday's they have brunch and lots of people waiting to get in. I might convince my man to come back. They have more fish for him to try and fish soup. I can't spell it but will find that pesky word later. The service was spotty. Had to ask for refills on our drinks quite a bit. :("}
{"text":"When I think if Mimi's, I think of muffins.   Mimi's Cafe is another one of our national chain restaurants.  I've been to several locations since its a known place.  They bake some amazing fresh muffins that are offered with breakfasts or separately.  Usually my visits are during the morning hours so a muffin is always accompanied.  Yes I rave about them but the main breakfast is just average.  Their omelette isn't anything over the top or memorable.  The filling inside is usually dim.  The breakfast potatoes are few and over salted.  I would suggest only getting coffee and a muffin for your morning meal here.   Service here has been pretty good.  They have been attentive and friendly.  My coffee was always refilled without me asking.   It's not the best of places but it will do."}
{"text":"Bonsoir. Bon Appetit.  What?  Wait staff using more French phrases now?  Alright what's going on here? Mimi's total makeover Francais takeover that's what!   Mimi's HQ has new handlers now. From the tone I got from reading the menu, they are going away from family style and turning it up a little more fancy schmancy dining. \"Boeuf Dip Francais\" aka French Dip.

I thought maybe there was another menu floating around but our server said nope that's the new menu now.  Oh and it looks like kids menu is gone too. I didnt see any kid friendly menu selections. Maybe you can request it.  What is cool is they are using more french traditional cooking techniques. What is not so cool, it all still tastes \"meh\"  When I started eating my order of Pot Pie Nouveau (English translation Chicken Pot Pie) there was no chicken in it!  Thinking to myself, maybe I ordered the vegetarian version? No lie, I thought I was being Punk'd there for a minute.  It was then my server came up and asked \"is there chicken in there?\" Oops!  Staff apologized.  This new menu was just implemented this week.  They were all still getting used to the new procedures and forgot to add chicken. It's all good. I understand. I actually feel sorry for the employees though. They look and seemed to be awkward  with the whole French style but despite that, service was c'est magnifique!  With all that said, I will be back since I am intrigued by the new transformation. Au revoir!"}
{"text":"I visited Mimi's Cafe this past Friday as part of a \"supper club\" group that meets at different restaurants once a week. So keeping in mind we had a larger party, I have to say I was not super impressed.  I ordered the Asparagus and Brie quiche. Was told a few minutes later that they were out of it, so I settled on the Quattro Fromage quiche instead. This is listed as one of their newer menu items.  One of my fellow diners got a salad which came with a HUGE blueberry muffin. This thing was enormous. We already had baskets of bread on the table, so It was a bit confusing why the salad came with a muffin, but apparently muffins are kind of their \"thing\". Anyway, this thing was VERY filling. We all had a taste of it and there was still some left over. A very cake-y texture, and heavy.  Next, the soup that came with my quiche came out. I had the daily special, Chicken Gumbo. I was pretty disappointed in the soup. It was a very small toureen of soup and there were huge hunks of celery and small bites of chicken in a pretty bland, thick broth. I'm not a big fan of celery, and I know places use it as an inexpensive \"filler\" vegetable, but the celery to soup ratio was kind of off considering what a small portion of soup you got.   The quiche was ok. The crust was plain and did not taste as though it was freshly made- more like they came pre-prepared and were just filled with whatever at the restaurant. Also, it was supposed to have sundried tomatoes in it, and I found two very small hunks of tomato in mine. For a quiche that was nearly 6\" across, that was disappointing. Also, for a quiche that was named \"Quattro Fromage\", the cheese flavor was sadly lacking.   For the next part of my review I will offer a qualification. I am not sure if Mimi's is intended for kids or not. They do have a nice kids' menu so I assume it's not uncommon for people to bring kids. That said, my kids' meals were a bit of a surprise. My one kid had applesauce as a side and I had to request a spoon just so he could eat it. He also had spaghetti with marinara sauce which was lukewarm at best. My other kid ordered mini corn dogs, and I had to request ketchup for him as well since it isn't provided on the table. Also, if you opt for the fruit as a side on the kids meal, it comes with the rinds still attached (pineapple, honeydew, and orange slices). I was a bit surprised by that. Finally, their meals came with a \"dirt cup\" dessert that I thought was super cute- chocolate pudding, oreo cookie crumbles on top, and two gummy worms sticking out. I thought this would be right up my kids' alley, but they didn't like it and neither finished their dessert. Kind of strange for a 5- and 7-year-old boys to not eat dessert!   Finally, I will comment on the server herself. I realise she had a bit of a hard time because their dining room is not laid out very well. Since there were 3 larger (6-7+ people) groups, she had to go all the way around three large tables to get from one end of our group to the other, as our table was up against the wall. However, I do think she could have at least tried to bus our table as we finished with things. Our table was crowded with dirty dishes we were through with that nobody ever took away. My water glass was also empty for much of my  meal, which is a pet peeve of mine.   When all is said and done, Mimi's may have fared better had they not been located across from Northlake Mall. Unfortunately, there are just too many good dining options at the mall for me to honestly say I would opt to eat here again. I'm glad I gave it a try, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Yes it is a chain and not a \"mom and pop\" eatery, and no it is not a 5 star restaurant, but holy hell some of the reviews here are brutal and incredibly unjustified. Yet, some of the highly rated trendy breakfast spots I've found to be complete garbage. More is not necessarily better. The \"huevos rancheros\" I received at one of the highly rated local breakfast spots was reminiscent of large amount of vomit on a plate. But, I digress.   I will limit my review to their breakfast service and food. The wait is never insanely long, and there are plenty of seats available inside of the restaurant while you wait. The entire staff is always very friendly and accommodating. We have tried their pancake breakfast and various omelets. The portions and quality are more than fair for the price that you pay. Our server has always been extremely attentive and friendly. I also enjoy their Pomosa, which is a spin off of traditional Mimosas. Instead of Orange Juice you get, you guessed it, Pomegranate Juice and champagne.   Mimi's is a great choice for a reasonably priced, quality breakfast."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Cafe!!! My two favorite people are Stacey and Daniel. Their service is impeccable and they always know exactly what I'm going to order. They make me feel like family when I'm there.  For those of you who love salads,Mimis mediteranian is the best!!! I have always loved the atmosphere here as well!! If you're looking for good food, service and comfortable atmosphere, Mimis is the place to go"}
{"text":"I went here the other day for breakfast by myself.  I had Leroy for a server and he was excellent.  They even gave me a muffin to take home since it was my first time.  I thought it was such a cute spot for breakfast or brunch and I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have not been into a Minis Cafe in quite some time. We are are moving back to the Seattle area and the hotel is right next door to Mimi's Cafe so we thought let's give it a try.  We walked in and was greeted so friendly. She asked us our names and welcomed us to Mimi's. we sat down and was immediately greeted by a very personable friendly server Tiffany. We talked for a bit and told her what I was in the mood for she was so helpful.  I went for the steamed mussels in a white wine reduction!!! AMAZING!!!!! This is a must have! My husband loves Fish and Chips. No let me tell everyone my husband has practically been around the world and has eaten in many different places. When Tiffany brought out the fish and chips Larry was blown away! His exact statement \"these are the best Fish and Chips I have eaten in years\"! My husband wanted Tiffany to tell the chef Chris that he did an outstanding job! Give this place another try! This is not a 2 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Staff and food were fantastic, great ambiance. The manager gave us free muffins to take home for it being our first time, which was nice. Even hubby was impressed with the food. Ambiance, I felt like I stepped back in time with great little features tucked away everywhere you look. Booths had plenty of space so we didn't  feel squeezed. Our server was fantastic and fun, the rest were as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food at Mimi's Cafe, but this Mimi's in particular is so dirty. It seems like they never clean the decorations on the wall. I happened to touch the back of a booth one time and my hand had gross, greasy accumulated dust/dirt. I let the waitress know and she said they only clean what the manager says to clean. This place could use a good deep scrubbing from top to bottom."}
{"text":"Definitely had better. Service and facility were nice.  Menu was too limited.  Food was not seasoned...very bland.  Great if you can't have spicy or seasoned food.  kids friendly...they were running up the isles."}
{"text":"Not bad for a restaurant that gets most of their food from bags.......order the muffins and salad....thats about the only thing not shipped in"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I absolutely love the service as well as the food. Its usually very quiet and quint, with friendly people that are enjoying their food. Everyone should try MiMi's Cafe for the down home experience."}
{"text":"I seem to frequent here for breakfast the most. Trying to eat as healthy as I can, I do like their low-calorie menu. I have to test my will power to not eat their delicious muffins and baked goods, my favorite, probably the carrot raisin-nut loaf. Also, I like that they have menu items that many breakfast places don't have, like Quiche Florentine.  I've read some not-so-good reviews about Mimi's for lunch and dinner, but I have to say I'd be up for going there for breakfast anytime."}
{"text":"Great food, great hospitality. The bartender did a good job serving us. There was a mix up and delay in the kitchen with one of our entrees but otherwise we had a nice experience. The berry mimosa was really fresh and you could tell they used the fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"the desert ridge mimi's is one of the worst restaurants. I've even there several times over the years and I think I've had 1 good experience there. today we went there because we had  2 for 1 coupon. from the moment we walked in it was a horrible experience. they wouldn't let us sit where we wanted. they had 1 room open that was crowded, bright and loud. as soon as we sat down the waiter came and made a huge, loud fuss about us wanting to sit elsewhere. all the people sitting around us could here it so they a thought we were being difficult....we were not. it took him a long him 10 minutes to finally ask us what we wanted to order.i was very hungry so I asked for bread while waiting. never got bread. took forever for meal to come. when it did come they put it on some body else's table then realized the mistake and then brought it to our table. they brought my soup out on the same plate as my sandwhich and my fiancee's salad on her entree plate which was very warm. I expressed my dissatisfaction that we did not get the soup and salad before the entree and that I would not eat a meal that sat on someone else's table however brief that was. who likes salad on a hot plate? then the manager took away the food with a bit of attitude. the lady who was sitting at the table where our food was first sent to leaned her head into our booth and said our food was fine and that she didn't want hear me whine. I told her to mind her own business. the manager said she would comp the meal. I told her I was not looking to get a comped meal. I told her I just decent service. she then picked up the meal and as she did she dropped the soup spoon which for some reason had soup all over despite the fact that did not touch soup. the spoon fell from about a 2 foot height and landed on my phone screen. at that point I was done and we left. bad place. more than once there has been hair in the food. one time there was a sign in the window that said \"CLOSED BY HEALTH DEPT.\""}
{"text":"It had been years since I had been to a Mimi's Cafe and I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've always thought of Mimi's as more of a breakfast place but the dinner options were good. We didn't have to wait long to be seated (Friday night) and when we were, our server (Cynthia) was very nice and accommodating.  I ordered the Quiche Lorraine which came with a salad and a muffin, and my girlfriend ordered the French Pot Roast with a side salad and we shared a cup of French Onion Soup. The girls ordered pancakes. The side salad and soup came out first, as well as my muffin (which they were so kind to grill for me). Dinner was not far behind but Cynthia stopped by our table to tell us that it would be out any time. The quiche was delicious and I took my leftovers home to heat up the next day. There is a layer of cheese between the crust and egg mixture that is a little thick but it was still very good. I don't like eggs but I like quiche but am quite picky about it (can't be runny, had to be pretty solid and have good flavor). It was definitely a good choice. The French Pot Roast received okay reviews, not the best but for what it was and where we were eating it was good. The girls liked their pancakes - for a kids meal it was $5.29 I believe...a little overpriced.  Overall, a good experience for us. A couple tables over (different server), there were two older couple seated and they were having an issue with a coupon that they expected. I watched the Assistant Manager come over and talk to them and pretty much tell them that they didn't receive the coupon they were expecting yet (email?) and that they were getting free muffins anyway. Then he walked away. The server came back about 10 minutes later with the check and told them that she took something off of it. Manager didn't seem like much help, server communicated better. That same server also left a table sitting without introducing herself or taking a drink order for about 10 minutes after they had been sat. Looking at some of the poor reviews, I can see why they were written if they had an experience like that. I'm sure it's just the luck of the draw.   Definitely recommend but suggest speaking up your service starts off poorly."}
{"text":"Usually good but today was terrible. Ordered eggs basted soft. Got scrambled. Sent back and they came back cold, basted with oil and burnt around the edges. Toast was pretty much NOT toasted. Manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill. They adjusted the check though, so that was nice."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast! The outdoor patio area is really nice. Their carrot raisin muffins are the best!"}
{"text":"I had the spinach dip and it was not good at all. Followed by the Turkey Pesto sandwich. That was just OK. That atmosphere was great though a very cute place."}
{"text":"This restaurant which I have eaten at for the past 35 years has progressively gotten worse and worse . The quality of the food and the service gone down the drain and it's worse than Denny's .  It took 30 minutes to make two eggs and my toast burned. I asked for sour dough bread and they tried to pass white bread as sour dough bread. By the time I got the toast my food was cold .  I was so upset I wanted to cancel the order . Now I will take the slip back home and give it to my dogs .  Never coming back to Mimi's Cafe on Stephanie."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and they had a nice selection. Would recommend any pasta dish. Very delicious! The little carrot cake biscuits they give you at the beginning of the meal were delectable. Feels like a cafe in some small remote town. Perfect for a dinner date!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Ordered off the lunch prix fixe menu: soup or salad, entree and drink for 10 bucks.  Had tastey corn chowder and a very good bbq chicken flat bread. Other menu items seemed a bit pricey. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Worse experience today at Mimi's.  My wife ordered their roast chicken, the chicken came white/pink (looking either uncooked or microwaved).  It looking nothing like the photo of the chicken in their menu.  They were asked to redo it to make it brown and crispy as shown in the menu photo. Once received back the chicken continued to look unappetizing and never looked like \"roast\" chicken.  Also, we sat at table without napkins and flatware.  Told waitress about no napkins/flatware; should forgot all above it, and had to get up and get it off another table.  After complaining about the roast chicken as noted above, the waitress marginalized our concern if it was no big deal and stated it was cooked to temperature to ensure it was not raw, forget about the fact the chicken looked terrible.  Not sure about Mimi's."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in the Arrowhead district of Peoria, AZ.  The staff is extremely friendly and Denise, our waitress today took care of all our needs and made sure our food was delivered in a good tempo so that we had time to enjoy and not feel rushed.  She also explained several specials new to the menu which I had not heard about so we had even more choices.  Also Todd, the manager came over to make sure we were having a good day and that makes me feel great!!  The whole staff is so friendly and responsive to our needs that I often bring visitors to our area here because I know they'll love it!!!!"}
{"text":"We belong to the eclub and get weekly coupons. just yesterday had a spend $30 get $10 off.  It was lunch so the bill came to $25.  We were able to buy two muffins to bring the bill up.  I like eating there.  Only gave it three stars because I have had a few not so good meals.  One thing seems to be consistent..don't order the eggs benedict.  I love the broiled flounder and my husband loves their salmon.  Liver and onions usually over cooked.  Most often staff is very accommodating. I'm a big fan of their blue cheese bacon and chicken quesidilla which is off the menu but the cooks is accommodating and makes it for me. Meal may not be a five star, but can't beat buy one, get one free.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here Aug 2011 ordered the grilled meatloaf with seasonal veggie and mashed potatoes. Time from order to delivery was 21 minutes, a bit on the long side especially considering the place was 85% empty. My GF ordered the small steak and salad.  There was gravy poured all over my plate except for the veggies. The gravy tasted like cheap, from a can, dark brown gravy. The potatoes looked like instant from a box. The combination of the two was not good. And the gravy on the meatloaf was also a non-starter. Personally I would have preferred ketchup on the 2 loaf slices and butter on the mashed.   My GF's salad arrived completely missing any dressing. She said the veggies were so limp and lifeless she ate one piece and left the rest go to the trash. Her steak was so small it was about 5 bites and gone.   Our wait service was decent, otherwise our experience was poor. We probably will never return."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the service has always been quick and friendly.  The food is moderately priced, served hot, and very tasty.  Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Meh...  Usually I love Mimi's but today was the worst experience.  We were sat in the corner and waited five minutes to even be greeted.  We ordered mimosas and after they were dropped off, we never saw our waiter until they were gone.  We felt super rushed when we ordered and when the food came out, my order was so wrong. I ordered a turkey Ruben and a cesar and got a chicken salad sandwich and a spinach salad. When I told the waiter my order was wrong he argued with me.  Ten minutes later he came back to get my order for something else which was actually really good. (I tried the salmon hibachi). I asked for it medium but before I could finish my sentence the waiter walked away. The fish came out over cooked but I ate it anyways because at that point I was starving!   Next time we won't go to a chain. Still kicking myself for giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is awful, the enivorment is what is sold here not the food. This is one of the worst places I've been too in my life."}
{"text":"Usually a wait...but Cinnamon Roll French Toast is heaven! Nom Nom Nom. I'm a sucker for a good mimosa and there are options which are heavenly! Definitely stop through if you're in the area! Look for the rooster and the one upside down picture in the restaurant. It's tradition."}
{"text":"Love Mimi's.    Salad is always good.  Salmon was great.   Service was awesome.  Here on business."}
{"text":"RIDICULOUS WAIT for your good to arrive at the table!!! 40 minutes? Really? Should've know better when we opened the lobby door and there was mayhem because the employees had Christmas decorations all over the floor and tables. Why they'd do their decorations in the middle of the lunch trade is beyond logic."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Mimis in a long time.  The restaurant is so very cold that the customers were  complaining even when the air stopped blowing.  Man who came out as we were entering said it was So cold that his food was cold before he got it!  We left before ordering.  I know this is Phoenix in the summer but that's mo excuse for freezing us out."}
{"text":"can't say enough about this mimi's. staff & food excellent. french onion soup to die for too. had pot roast tonite and no need for a knife. wife had skewered shrimp & salmon. 2 great meals. yea mimi's"}
{"text":"We were there for Thanksgiving,  our party of 18 was seated right away. I have a soy allergy and informed the waiter, he looked like he just saw a ghost. He finally came back and told me that everything had soy except 2 items, so that's what I had to eat. They weren't very accommodating.  Then, we waited 30 minutes or so for our meals, the waiters kept bringing the wrong plates and had to take some of our orders again, uugh.  I ordered a bloody Mary, waiter informed me they had no vodka. Hmm, didn't I just walk past the bar? Horrible Thanksgiving experience,  I won't be back."}
{"text":"What is going on with Mimi's?  Is it because they have a new mega-restaurant chain owner now?  The menu is very different from the old, multi-page full of goodies menu.  Supposedly they are trying to be more \"French\" now instead of Louisiana-inspired.  The new potato gratin based eggs benedict was good and fresh and the quiche Lorraine my sis ordered was still the same--yummy, cheesy and filled with bacon.  The fruit sides were pitiful, hard pieces of unripe fruit.  They don't offer muffins or quick breads vs fruit sides anymore, you need to order them ala carte.  When I mentioned to the MOD, Luis, that the only reason I wanted to bring my sis to this place is they don't have a Mimi's in Hawaii and I was a cheerleader for their food, especially the lovely sized meals and the hot muffins.  So sad that things have changed, and not necessarily for the better.  Thank you for the service, Luis (and server), but I am still dropping a measly 2 stars on this experience because of the menu change, the freezing temps in the dining area (which patrons applauded when the fan stopped blowing, that's how cold it was), and the fact that the entire dish wasn't good enough for more praise.  I did the survey online to share my thoughts on the changes, but doubt that I'll use the $5 coupon to come back.  There are way too many other awesome options for breakfast and brunch in Vegas."}
{"text":"They can't make toast.  Not kidding.  Incapable.  Do yourself a favor and go to Wafflehouse instead, at least they can make toast."}
{"text":"One of my first times here and the lunch was pretty tasty and reasonable priced. I picked two for $9.99 off the special deal on back of the menu and ended up with some lukewarm corn chowder and half of a turkey club sandwich. Both items were serviceable with the sandwich slightly edging out the soup. The one thing that bugged me (isn't there always one) was the fact that I saw bread baskets being delivered all over to the dining room to everyone, but our table. I finally had to ask i\"what's the deal with the bread baskets man?\" No explanation, but I did get my two bread sticks and butter finally. The birthday crepe cake they offer for free just looks weird, but overall this chain seems to feature better than normal chain food."}
{"text":"Food is astounding! There was no wait. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is like an old time, small town café. I loved it. Even the bathrooms are wonderful."}
{"text":"Instead of picking one of our \"norms\" for Sunday dinner, my friends and I decided to give Mimi's a try. For a Sunday night, the place was pretty empty, we were seated right away and our waiter arrived in no time.   Mimi's specializes in \"French inspired cuisine\" and offer a variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. I went with their classic French Dip sandwich with the house salad as my side. The dip and creamy horseradish sauce comes on the side and if you chose you can add cheese, peppers and mushrooms. I didn't add any of that and honestly for me it was just okay. I did really like the baguette bread but it just wasn't a favorite for me.   I'm going to come back, because I want to give their breakfast options a try and try one of their signature dishes like the meatloaf or chicken pot pie. Oh yeah, and there's a good amount of dessert options that I'll need to try!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Where do I start? The food is awesome the atmosphere is great the service is awesome and their coffee is second to none. After moving here from Louisiana my wife and I have found that finding a reasonably priced restaurant with everything that I listed above it's next to impossible to find here. If you haven't eaten here you owe it to yourself. I have paid much more and gotten much less many times. This place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"BF used to be a huge fan of this chain, popular when he was growing up in CA. They used to have a French menu, but now there's only a handful of French-esque options left. Given the relatively low recent reviews though, I was pleasantly surprised.  DEVILED EGGS: three eggs each of three versions offered, 9 halves for $6. One with bacon, one with a tomato-y twist, and another less memorable version. Not sure why it's on the menu, doesn't go with anything else. MEATBALL APP: generous portion for an app, could be an entrée. The sauce was surprisingly tasty, a bit on the sweet side and reminiscent of a tomato-basil soup, but in an oddly good way. Seasonal item? FRENCH ONION SOUP: Not bad, not in the top 10 of the best versions I've had. FRENCH STEW: sausage, spinach, and white beans, sided with a salad. One of the healthier options available, but still hearty. I'd recommend this.  The above was enough for a full dinner for two, plus leftovers for the next day's lunch, for $35 including tip. Good value, but they clearly seem to be struggling. BF was incredibly disappointed with the visit, says the dishes here don't begin to compare to how good they used to be and many menu favorites are now gone."}
{"text":"took 20 minutes for food to come, found wax paper in my crepe. didn't even ask how we were doing, manager didn't care either. horrible service."}
{"text":"We love this Mimi's location. We have been coming here for a number of years. The staff is some of the best around! The food is always hot and delicious. Nice and relaxing after a day at the office."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful brunch here.  The peach mimosa was delicious and they get style points for bringing out the flute with the juice then pouring in the Korbel brut champagne!  I ordered the smoked salmon benedict and was blown-away at how good it was.  The yukon gold potatoes were roasted to perfection.  Their only miss for me was not being offered a basket of muffins or croissants - that is what they're known for.  Otherwise, brilliant!!"}
{"text":"This rating is specifically on my most recent visit. Ordered the French onion soup to go which I have gotten many times, to go and dine in. Placing the order was quick and easy (1 star). Got home where I don't live more than 7 minutes away. Unpacked my food and the cheese was not melted on top of the soup. (Honestly, that's one of the best parts of French onion soup.) So I pushed the cheese aside and tried the soup... cold and onions pretty much raw and still very crunchy. Apparently this is a to go and cook at home soup? So I had to throw it on the stove and give it a good cook until the onions softened and throw the cheese back on and gave it a broil to have the nice yummy browned cheese. The bread baguette that came in the soup and on the side was VERY hard and stale. I know the bread in the soup is supposed to be crunchy but it just tasted awful. At least the little carrot breads were still good (1 star). Very unfortunate considering I frequent this restaurant regularly."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for lunch here today and I had a great experience. I called and placed my order and the girl that answered the phone was really friendly and nice. She said that the order would be ready in ten minutes and when I arrived ten minutes later, she had it all packaged up waiting for me. I asked her to throw in some bread to dunk in my soup and she kindly added it, no charge. Suuweeet! My coworker had ordered the chicken strips and the girl told me that they were small today, so she had them throw in a few extra. Who does that? This chick rocks!  My throat was really sore, so I opted for a cup of french onion soup! It is awesome here, definitely the best I have had. They serve it with a baguette and raisin bread that is to die for.   I only ran in to get my order, so I can't really comment on the table service or the restaurant itself, but that chick totally made my day by being so nice, so this location gets 5 stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Never had a bad experience. Tomato soup is acidic, and not for those with digestive issues... but it is tasty.  The Marsala dishes are excellent!!  Our server, Kirk was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. Also, he really personalized the meal by asking lots of questions about preferences and taste. Great job!!  The only issue was when the Manager, who I identified by him tag, but did not catch the name, took my GFs coffee. The had just mixed the sugar and cream, took one sip and set it down. The manager came by and just took it, without asking, and said \"We just put on some fresh coffee, let me get you a new cup.\"  Hey Mr. Manager, some people like their coffee just the way it is. A fresh pot is not always better, but either way, how about you ask first!!"}
{"text":"They don't have biscuits and gravy like Yelp said. I came just for that but the mimosa was delish!"}
{"text":"we order Mimi's all the time for lunch meetings! They are great at pick up orders. They never give you a hard time and take care of you right when you get there."}
{"text":"Mimis was recommended to try by a friend. Overall, it was okay if you're just looking for breakfast.   Our waiter was a nice gentleman, who was mostly attentive.  I had to order my coffee twice, because he forgot when I initially ordered.  Two managers walked by checking on us, which was also nice.   I ordered the Bacon, Mushroom, Brie omelette. It comes served with roasted potatoes. The omelette was okay, but liquidy due to the vegetables present. The potatoes, although roasted nicely, were very bland.   The atmosphere of Mimis is casual, which was nice, and I would return to try something new if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I have enjoyed meals at this Mimi's before and it merited return visits. Today, we arrived at 9:00AM. We asked for outside seating to enjoy the fall temperatures. I was seated outdoors at a table that was covered with filthy, grease stained table cloth and the S/P shakers, sugar etc. we're covered with baskets on all tables.  It appeared the tables had not been cleaned or set and from the previous evening.I moved to 3 tables before finding one that was quasi clean.  We ordered  coffees and one ice tea. The coffee arrived in dirty cups and the ice tea arrived with a wad of chewing gum IN the glass.  YIKES! When asked, the waiter brought silverware and placed it in pile in the center of the table. We waited for 10 minutes for our waiter to ask to see the manager.  He failed to appear and someone in our party  sought ought the maitre'D. A person appearing to be a chef appeared and we asked for a manager. He left and the Maitre 'D appeared 10 minutes later. Sadly,  we cancelled our order and left. We will not return due to total lack of conventional sanitary/health conditions and standards and ineffective or poorly executed management and QC . What happened Mimi's??????  ***We had an excellent breakfast at Lazy Dog in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants. I've had both lunch and dinner here and enjoyed it every time. The coffee and desserts are good too. The decor is nice for date night or a small couples dinner. Service is prompt, usually no wait to be seated."}
{"text":"We had forgotten what a bad experience we had here a year ago. Hopefully, we won't make that mistake again. There were six in our party, three received incomplete dishes. Three received cold food. The other three were just warm.  The waiter, Nathan, didn't want to hear anything about it. The manager got us warmer food with the missing sauces. I can see why the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday night. My 10 year-old grandson loves turkey, but even he barely ate his. That says a lot. Poor service, awful food, terrible plating, dirty coffee cups, lack of professionalism add up to one of the worst dinner ever!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner,wasn't disappointed with our food, however it to ok so long to be seated we almost walked out. I ordered Beef Bourguignon, and my dinning companion ordered the chicken cordon Blue, both were most excellent. The portion size was so large , I had 2 meals out of it. I also enjoyed the different types of bread your given, and the french onion soup was awesome. Defiantly would go back again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I keep trying this place. The service is slow and inadequate and the food is not great. My sons pancakes were burned,  my avacado was nowhere near ripe and the 'carmalized onions' were raw.   The Cafe mocha they brought to me was warm, not hot, and had been spilled all over the saucer. She apologized, which was lovely of her, but that did not solve the cup-dripping problem.  We were never offered refills on our drinks nor did anyone come by mid-meal to see if we needed anything.    To add insult to culinary injury, the 'freshly baked pumpkin muffin' had been microwaved to atomic temperatures, making it rubbery and nowhere near appealing.   This is my 3rd and last visit to this place and I feel like a sucker for bothering after the first visit."}
{"text":"My favorite place--never disappoints.Everything is delicious..I especially enjoy the new French inspired menu"}
{"text":"I have been to this and other locations more times than I care to count. It is a a-ok chain restaurant that delivers good results. The food is generally good, the service is generally good, the atmosphere is very cute, and it's basically a great place for lunch with the girlfriends or any time really.   Let's start with the decor. It is a very French/New Orleans type of feel to the place. There are a multitude of things to look at decorated on the walls. Some areas look more \"classic bistro\" while others have more of a \"jazz\" feel to them. The seating is similar to other restaurant layouts with both booths and tables and also a bar seating area.   Next, the food. Again, I have been to this place plenty of times. It is a mixture of French bistro and American food. Nothing I have had here struck me as not good or not well made. How can you go wrong? I have mostly stuck to sandwiches and burgers.  Everything was always done to order. I do have to say the quiche is something that I get here because I can't seem to find it anywhere else. The onion soup is also delicious.   I would definitely rather come here than many other chains even if for the atmosphere alone. Unfortunately they are far from home so it is either a destination, or a coincidence when I do come."}
{"text":"The 3 star average for this place is spot on. Unlike other reviewers, I just checked this place out for the first time recently, twice in one week. First time was to pick up two quarts of their soup, for about 11 bucks. That's a great deal compared to Safeway or Basha's. Then, ate lunch there yesterday. The joint was jam packed with people 80+!!!! What's the deal there? Guess super old people just love Mimi's! Seems like the senior center dropped off a busload of folks. Anyway, burger was pretty good to OK, nothing special. Salad was pretty good, nothing special. Onion rings... 2 thumbs down, very greasy. And, my Wife's grilled cheese sandwich was exceptional. It was also very surprising to me that there is a full bar there! This would be the last place in the universe I'd go to sit and have a scotch on the rocks, but then again, I don't drink scotch. So, I may or may not go back here, as this place didn't strike me as standing out one way or another."}
{"text":"Had a great expierince, our waiter \"Xavier\" Was by far the best waiter I have ever had, he was great with the family and made the kids laugh... Thanks.. The food was excellent, I had the Mussles with Linguini, and the raison bread was like having desert before dinner... GREAT JOB GUYS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good location... all around good! This was my first time eating at a Mimi's and I was quite impressed. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend convinced me to go here for breakfast because it was her father's favorite place.  Having read the Yelp reviews I was unsure but figured why not give it a try.  We were greeted by friendly staff, seated immediately and our waiter was with us within a minute to offer coffee and drinks.  They have a great mimosa menu.  I had the grapefruit and my friend had strawberry lemonade.  AMAZING!  I ordered the croissant benedict  and my friend had the original waffles.  The meal was out of this world amazing!  I'm so glad I ignored Yelp as this is now one of my favorite breakfast establishments.  Next time I'm back in Arizona I will be visiting Mimis Cafe.  Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"There's only one problem with Mimi's, and it's the food!  The design and concept are great, but the food itself is some of the worst in Summerlin.  It's hard to mess up breakfast foods, but they managed to serve lumps of overcooked eggs and undercooked bacon.  Their croissants are doused in butter, and not even in a good way.  Le disgusting.  (I doubt my French is very good, but it's still better than Mimi's)"}
{"text":"Well, I won't be going here again in the foreseeable future.  We went for breakfast and the food was alright at best. My bacon was not cooked as ordered so the waiter awkwardly made me remove the bacon from my plate of food to put on a separate plate he had to take away - all the while without saying a word. Also the portions of eggs and potatoes were small. The blueberry muffin was the best part of the whole experience.   The waiter was the worst part of the experience. We had Todd. I'm pretty sure you can't even call this guy a waiter. (For the record I waitressed in college so I understand how it's supposed to be done & the hardships that come along with the job). He hardly spoke to us and was beyond weird. He made my boyfriend and I feel uncomfortable and awkward during all points of interaction. Sure, he was pretty functional and brought things we asked for, but he had a better than thou sort of persona. Never asked if anything was ok, never said you're welcome to a thank you (he wouldn't say anything but just walk away), and the bored to death look never left his face. It pretty much felt he hated having to wait on us, hated his job, and hated life.  The entire visit was weird and like I said, we will not be going back. I gave this place 2 stars for the fact the food was decent and the restaurant seemed clean. I would recommend to steer clear of this place unless you like mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"I want to sum this up for people that don't read entire reviews. Some of the worst service I've ever had.   Went here for lunch with a business client  I ordered tomato basil soup ( incorrectly listed as bisque) and a turkey pesto ciabatta which came my my voice of fries, chips or for a $1 more onion rings or sweet potato fries. The sandwich comes with fresh roasted turkey, bacon, tomato, lettuce, mozzarella avocado, and a basil pesto mayonnaise. I went with the chips and requested no tomatoes or lettuce on the sandwich.   The person I was with ordered soup and a salad. The soups both arrived, I really enjoyed mine and he enjoyed his French Onion. An appropriate amount of time later out entrees arrived. By the time I realized my sandwich had tomatoes and lettuce on it and I also received fries (not the chips I ordered) the waitress had vanished. Although it was lunch time the place wasn't very busy, I would say they were steady but far from busy. The waitress didn't return until she brought the check and my associate had already finished his meal (no drink refills, no checkup after the food came out, nothing). I actually started to worry about her well being, had someone kidnapped her?   I hadn't moved the plate from where she placed it when it came out. It was obvious that the food hadn't been touched at all and she asked if I wanted a box. I pointed out the fact that everything was wrong and told her I just wanted the bill because I didn't want my associate to sit there and watch me eat my lunch. I just wanted to pay and leave and never go to another MiMi's cafe again. Instead of offering me a  new correct sandwich and chips to go she returned with the bill that still had my sandwich listed. She apologized and came back with the corrected bill.   If you insist on eating here, order the soup and get it to go."}
{"text":"A close college friend took me here on a trip to Arizona, thoroughly enjoyed myself. Tom (the proprietor) took the time to chat with us, which was really quite nice."}
{"text":"Couldn't be a nicer wait staff and friendlier service. Atmosphere is a great casual place and very relaxed.  Service is a 5 Food is 3.5 Atmosphere is a 4  People are super friendly, everyone is working hard, and the menu has something for everyone.  Fun place, enjoyed it thoroughly"}
{"text":"We went here last night for our 5 year wedding anniversary & I can't tell you how disappointing the experience was. About 6-7 years ago Mimi's was a hot spot with excellent French food & great service. Not anymore. The only thing we ordered that I really enjoyed was the peach mimosas. For starters we ordered the deviled eggs. They were definitely pre-made & not fresh. There were 9 total: Supposed to be 3 bacon & chive, 3 \"mimosa\", and 3 with pickles & capers. They were all bacon & chive. We also ordered a kid's size mac & cheese to share for an appetizer. It was a bowl of overcooked penne with way too much watery \"cheese\" sauce. There was no bacon or Parmesan crust & it wasn't appealing at all. My husband ordered the fish & chips for his meal. The fries were soggy & the fish mediocre and the plating presentation was sloppy at best. I ordered a French dip sandwich with French soup for my entree. I was expecting a French restaurant to at least get these items right. NOPE. Not even close. The sandwich was not on a baguette & I only got au jus after I asked for it. The bread was a soft untoasted hoagie roll & the meat was cold, unflavorful & tough. So gross. I literally took 2 bites then brought the rest home for my dogs. The French soup was salty & overheated. There was something firm in it that resembled sausage but after poking it with my spoon I deduced that it was a piece of bread or toast. Everything tasted old & reheated. We refused dessert after the train wreck meal we just had. I don't even think they would have gotten dessert right. The service was also complete crap. Our server cared nothing for any of his tables (he only had 3) & spent more time in the kitchen that actually serving. I will never patronize this establishment again & I urge all the Yelpers out there to do the same. It was a total waste of money & we could have gone to a way better restaurant for the cash we spent there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for an early dinner on April 25th and we both enjoyed their food and most especially their service. I forgot our server's name but she was very knowledgeable about their menu, friendly personality and very accommodating.  I was a little disappointed because they took out the mussels on their updated menu. But nonetheless, I tried their French Pot Roast for the first time and I really liked it---a recommendation from our amazing server. The meat was really soft, the sauce was not salty and was seasoned well, it went very well with the mashed potatoes.  Again, when you experience a great service, it changes everything."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Felt like I was having to beg for napkins and a refill on the ice tea.  Pancakes were possibly the worst we have ever had. They were thin dry and crispy. The liver and onions was very good."}
{"text":"Sub par food. Slow service"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Mimi's because my husband had never eaten there and it had an eclectic menu- everything from quiche and crab cakes to ribs and burgers. We had the zucchini spears with parmesan as an appetizer- it was flash fried, so not greasy, and the veggies kept their texture.   Hubby was well pleased with his strawberry lemonade (it was quite tart and yummy) and with his French Dip with cheese, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. It was not as rare as we are used to from Houston's French Dip (the planet's best, we are convinced), but still moist and quite generously portioned.   I made the horrible mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak. I'm not sure what that was on my plate, but it was rubbery and tasted vaguely of fish. The sauce was tasteless and had a nasty been-sittin'-around- too-long film. The waitress came by quickly to check on us and took away the badness (I was very nice about it to her face, of course) and brought me the BLT I should have ordered in the first place. It was delicious and had I don't know how many rashers of bacon goodness on it.   All in all, the service was excellent and everything we had except the chicken fried steak was good. They corrected the problem very quickly and with a great attitude."}
{"text":"Wow! Food sucks. This is the second time yelping ever out of an emergency to get the quality of your food up to par. Up your game folks. I had a tired plate of grey nothingness with burned tasting decaf coffee. Servers were good though. You have problems in the kitchen and need some help."}
{"text":"We went here for Thanksgiving. My boyfriend and I are far from our loved ones, and he had work that day so we decided to have a bit of Thanksgiving even it's just the two of us. We got seated quickly even if we didn't have reservations.   Their Thanksgiving meal consisted of soup (we got the pumpkin soup - delicious!), turkey slices (moist) with gravy and separate cranberry relish, mashed russet and sweet potato (delicious!), stuffing (just okay), and pie (we got pumpkin pie - delicious!). Service is good."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience at this Mimi's.  We have been living here in Las Vegas for over two years and we have probably eaten at Mimi's at least twice a month.  The food is always good, and the service is great.  Very few times have we had to wait for our food to be served.  If it ever was a little slow, it was probably because it was during the noon rush hour."}
{"text":"Without being mean about it. I will simply say that we have had better diner food.  The seasoning is either bland. or completely off the mark.  The staff takes their sweet time serving food and the crowd is a little north of the mid 50 demo.  Hit up Timbers across the street for much better and cheaper food"}
{"text":"Generic breakfast menu in a generic atmosphere attempting to impersonate a French country cabin.  For breakfast, Mimi's Cafe offers what is essentially a diner menu with some upscale dishes (quiche, variety of baked goods).  Nothing's awful here, but nothing I've had off the menu is particularly inspired or interesting.  The egg dishes are well-prepared and the sausage was good enough, but there's not much seasoning--nothing to distinguish the breakfast dishes from any diner in any city.  Bottom line: there's a lot better breakfast in this city, but I guess you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, freindly wait staff and i enjoy the atmosphere and jazz music, if your looking for a quite dinner out with a date or family, this is a nice place to go too, the menu is a little on the expensive side compared to other places, but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Delicious food.   The Mimi Mosas were extremely refreshing drinks and the creme brûlée cheese cake might be hands down the best cheese cake I have ever tasted.   Truly a great place and I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!  I had the Cobb salad. It wash delicious. Fresh blue cheese and roasted turkey. It came with a freshly baked carrot arisen muffin, mom had the 1/2 and 1/2 salad and sandwich. Home made dressings along with a side of fruit...real fruit. All this with a Southern Lousiana flare"}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe USED to have such a great menu and delicious food. What the hell happened?? I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup ($5.99) looked like it was a tall cup. It was nasty. Like eating tasteless gravy or hospital food. A basket of two rolls and two small squares of pumpkin bread were placed on the table. Rolls were also tasteless and very dense. But the pumpkin bread was awesome, no wonder they are not as generous with them.  My husband had the roast beef au jours........the au jours was so greasy you could see grease bubbles floating.The roast beef tasted processed. I will not return. A good place for folks over 90 years of age."}
{"text":"Best Mimi's ever! I love the $5-6 soup!! I get it almost every week and the service is excellent fast and efficient. One time I even got soup to go and got a free bread basket to go with it how thoughtful! The place also gives free muffins with a purchase if you sign up online how nice!"}
{"text":"Mimis Cafeé has the taste of home cooked food, the atmosphere is \"country living\". Make sure your note forgotten if they have you wait, sometimes which happens. When you order your food, you must order an entree or you get no bread basket. The bread is very good, and an assortment. The servers' have been ordered not to serve bread unless they have received and order of entree. So its not the servers' fault it is the policy of the company. Usually there is no wait."}
{"text":"My second visit to Mimi's was nothing like the first. I ordered the cinnamon roll French Toast. The cinnamon roll they used was stale. The fruit in the fruit cup was either unripe or moldy.   My daughter ordered the strawberry banana waffle. It was ok, but her fruit was gross too.   Service was ok, but server did not seem to care about the moldy fruit.   I still tipped her, but I will NEVER go back to Mimi's cafe."}
{"text":"Definite hit or miss! I used to love Mimi's in Albuquerque. I always got a Cobb salad or French quarter, can't go wrong. Both are consistently awesome! The location here in Goodyear is just... Ok.... We keep going back, but it never hits home like the one in Albuquerque. My hubby likes to try different things every time we go and is never impressed, he really liked the chicken crepes, ordered another time, it was horrible... I love the fresh fruit options, it's way better than a lot of places, salads, always good. Everything else... Meh... Any bread items are always good tho, we just try to limit refined super processed foods."}
{"text":"Well, after last night I'm done with this Mimi's. My mother and I have been going here for years, as long as they have been open. The last couple years this place has been going down hill. The price of the food has been slowly going up and the quality has been going down. When I pay $20 for dinner with a cup of soup that's way the hell to much for a glorified Denny's. My mom and I went here for dinner last night and the place was completely empty. We ordered and waited for our food. I always have the corn chowder because it's usually very good. Last night however it was way to thick and tasteless. I tried salting it but it did nothing. Then the waiter brought our dinner and right when he sat my seafood pasta down I knew something was wrong with it. I could smell a strong pungent odor that was not what it should smell like. The waiter walked away and I took a good whiff. It smelled like rotten urine. I am not exaggerating. This smelled BAD! They had also forgotten to put on the skewer of shrimp that I paid for. I called over another waiter to have him smell it and he said it smelled just fine. He then asked me if I wanted them to make another one so I agreed. He took my dish and went into the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back out with my dish and sat it down. It was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time. The scallops were burnt and the pasta was also burned around the outside of the dish. I tried to eat it but it was disgusting. The sauce was way to thick and the pasta was extremely sticky. It tasted horrible! I had one fork full and that was it. I pushed it aside and didn't eat anymore. The waiter came over later and didn't say a thing about the fact that I didn't eat my dinner. Not one sorry, not one can I get you anything else, no manager coming out to try and fix the situation.....nothing! This place has gone to shit. I will never be back. This used to be one of my favorite places but that's no longer the case. Do yourself a favor and just stay away."}
{"text":"I take my 81 year old mom out to dinner every week in this area and have dined at Mimi's 3 or 4 times over the years.  It is a hit or miss kinda place. I love the raisin and the banana bread there and that may be why I have gambled on the place more than once.  Last night we had the Mediterranean Chicken Fettuccine with spinach, sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and tomato asiago cream sauce. Topped with fresh diced tomatoes and grated parmesan cheese. It was fantastic! Huge serving and we both will return to order it again some day! In the past I had the turkey dinner with cranberry sauce and it was terrible. Dinner at Mimi's is like what Forest Gump said... \"You never know what your gonna get\""}
{"text":"My Elderly Aunt was visiting from out of town this week and we took her to Mimi's last night.  There were 5 of us in our party.  In the past, Mimi's has had great food and service and our kids love the menu.   Not so anymore, I was downright embarrassed by the waitress and the lousy food.    First, I asked for lemon with my iced tea and the waitress never brought it.  The restaurant was nearly empty on a Friday night so she was not busy. The iced tea had a funky \"off\" taste so my husband and I asked if we could have two coke's instead.  She obliged, but insisted that the tea was fresh.  If I had a lab nearby, I would bet the tea was old and loaded with bacteria.  Secondly, the waitress never took the \"old\" tea when she brought the replacements.  The tables are small enough without the extra dishes cluttering everywhere.  My Aunt even commented on not having room at the table and the waitress seemed clueless.  When our \"medium well\" burgers arrived they were raw inside!  We sent them back, which I hate to do because I fear retaliation from the kitchen.  My Aunt (has very little strength in her hands) asked the waitress if she would put her chicken pot pie in a 2-go container for her. This clearly pissed off the waitress and she made a snarky remark, grabbed the container and walked away.  I am afraid to reheat this after we could clearly see her anger toward my Aunt. Overall, the experience was embarrassing, expensive, and a huge REGRET.  We will never eat at Mimi's again.  BTW, we asked for more bread at the table and we were charged as it was added to our bill and sent in a to go bag.   WTF????"}
{"text":"I would like to say thank you to Christin.   We had the worst service here the last time with an assistant manager leaving a new server to drown!   This time we got a server named Christin and is was amazing! Super fast, always smiling, not bothersome at all, and as alway.... Mimi's awesome lunches! I would recommend this lady to everyone on top of hiring her on the spot to work for me!  Thanks again Christin!"}
{"text":"If I could provide no stars, I would. My family and I went to this Mimi's location this morning for breakfast. My wife and three kids were greeted by a blonde waitress who distractedly took our drink orders, and when I asked if she would provide us with bread, acted like I had requested her to raise the titanic. She said she'll only bring bread if we ask, but since I did, she would do so. She brought the bread, took our orders, and when I ordered I asked for a BLT, and requested that she underline this exception: EXTRA CRISPY BACON!  She said she would, but I did not see her write that on the ticket.  From this point on until she dropped off the final check, we did not see her.  Someone else brought our food, but never once did she stop to see if our food came out right, or to refill any drinks. She simply disappeared. The reason I am writing this review, however, is because of the bacon. It was exceptionally fatty and soggy and absolutely disgusting. It was the furthest from crispy you could possibly get. After picking through the bacon I was able to find just enough to eat one half of the sandwich, but the rest was so fatty I had to give up. The final bill was $75 for breakfast. A terrible one at that. Outrageous.   The irony? When she picked up the bill, she looked on my plate, picked it up, and took it away. What would any respectable server have done? She would've seen an entire plate full of food, and asked me what was wrong with it. Then she would've called over manager and taken the item off my bill. I will never, ever go to this restaurant again, and I strongly recommend you consider not doing so either."}
{"text":"Alas, all good things must come to an end. Last night, Thursday at 9:45 pm, the staff locked up the restaurant earlier than their posted hours till 10 pm. Worse yet, the server, a woman I've seen work here many times in the evening, saw my car pull up since she was bringing in the sign, and locked the door without speaking to me. I walked up and saw them through the window chatting away. I've been through this enough times to say that this is one of the best ways to lose a customer - see my previous review on fresh &easy, I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I've been to Mimi's numerous times and the meals and service often have been mediocre. However, I give this particular Mimi's four stars because of the excellent service my family received on our recent visit. Our waitress was perfectly attentive -- not too bothersome, with just the right amount of \"popping-in\" time to make sure we were happy and content. What sealed the four-star deal was when we left and my sister and I forgot our take-out boxes, our waitress ran out to us to bring them to us.  I was so impressed!  That has NEVER happened.  I give hundreds of kudos to good service, and this was definitely one of those cases.  Oh, and the other great thing about Mimi's: their to-die-for French onion soup.  It's AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch here the other day. My server was attentive and friendly and the food (Benedict) was very good. My only complaint is that the Bloody Mary was boring-I drank less than half before deciding that coffee was a better option."}
{"text":"I would never eat here again because the table wasn't clean, the food wasn't good, they messed up the orders, the service was lacking.   I ordered a simple meal; eggs, toast, and bacon. I asked my eggs to be fried hard and they were runny, my little brother also asked for his eggs to be fried hard and they were very runny. We asked for pecan pancakes and there were no pecans in the pancakes so they had to make them again. I feel like this place is over priced for a bad experience."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Mimi's Cafe and to be honest probably won't return. I gave 2 stars because the food wasn't bad , however the service was less than you would expect on a slow Sunday afternoon. We were seated immediately and given our drinks promptly, unfortunately it went down hill from there.   We waited close to 45mins for 3 sandwiches and a kids chicken fingers and never got refills on our drinks and our waiter didn't return until he gave us our check. If you have an extra 2 hours for a meal with subpar service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We often have to come down to Scottsdale for doctor visits and we ALWAYS stop in here for either breakfast or lunch and ALWAYS have a delicious meal with a Buttermilk Spice muffin on the side.  Can't wait to get back even if it means a doctor visit."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Just love the extensive menu and freshly baked items! Triple berry mimosas where super!  I was very disappointed to approach the restroom as smells were wreaking before I got within 6 ft. from it. I have been here many times in the past and found some issues before than continue to exist. The following: filthy smelly ladies restroom; in need of deep cleaning of floors and especially walls/grout. Dusty dirty ceilings and vents. Dusty sink surrounds and stored slippery when wet sign near dirty/stained trash container. Above all, dirty and broken child diaper changing station. Same old broken safety belt to hold the child in place.  Safety first!"}
{"text":"My family and I dine here very often. Between my son, wife, and myself we've had close to half the menu. The service is always great and the food is always quick and fantastic. They give very large portions for very good prices. The decor is very nice and has a very New Orleans feel. There's very nice jazz music playing softly in the background. I highly recommend this for a good family dinner."}
{"text":"Killer breakfast!  Not sure why so many negative reviews were written for Mimi's, but we had a great first visit.  Blueberry cinnamon brioche french toast?  Yes please!  Free juice and muffins?  Um, yes!  Good coffee, great menu variety, and service was solid."}
{"text":"Wife and I love it and my out of town parents can't wait to visit it when they come into town.. and the PUMPKIN PANCAKES YUM!!!  I whole-heartedly recommend Mimi's!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and probably the last time, unless I'm desperate to eat out and just ran out of other places to go for brunch.   I started off by ordering some hot tea which I found was a little strange when the waitress came out with just hot water and then asked me what tea I wanted....she didn't even give me options and just stood there staring at me blankly. Ooook then so I will ask the question, \"what kind of teas do you have?\" She listed me the teas they have and I picked one and she went back to the kitchen to grab the tea. Generally wouldn't you ask what tea the diner wanted first or at least present the options when you bring the hot water?? Ok not such a big deal, we'll move past this.   Ordered the quiche which was equivalent to eating a cheese pizza from Dominos...easy with the cheese guys there are other ingredients in a quiche too. I also ordered a chocolate croissant which was good, so I will give a star for that.  What really bothered me from this meal was when the waitress brought my bill literally 2 seconds after I bit into my food. I barely got to taste my food and she's already rushing me to check out??? She didn't even bother to ask me if I wanted to order anything else. This is downright rude and such poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and while it is much better than any Dennys or iHop it still seems very pricey.  We have had breakfast and lunch so far.  While both were good it is more than we care to spend."}
{"text":"We recognized this brand from Thousand Oaks California. This Henderson, NV restaurant did not disappoint. The food portions were large. We ordered two breakfast dishes for three people and it was plenty. The coffee was good too and kept coming as if there was a direct pipe line from Columbia. Midweek it was not busy. We were seated and served right away."}
{"text":"so gross. wth happened, Mimi's?! used to be good. mom brought home chicken and this potato casserole thing. couldn't even eat it. chicken was under cooked! and the worst fries I have ever eaten. went to Mimi's on 215 and rainbow few yrs back. it was not good either. and they closed down. it's time to shut down, Mimi's. which is a shame since u were so good before"}
{"text":"Breakfast is pretty good here... Not fantastic. Service tends to be a little on the slow slide. However, the $5 mimosas are so good. Would I say it's my favorite breakfast place in Vegas? No. But it's worth a try. They have a few items on the menu that are worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Found a very small piece of plastic in a salad and the manager and server were so apologetic and kind when we mentioned it. The customer service here is great! He gave us the salad free and threw in two to-go muffins to apologize. Great experience and still the best corn chowder ever!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Food was delivered quickly, our server, Catherine, was very attentive and super nice, and we had been sat almost immediately on a busy Sunday morning.  I've been coming to Mimi's for a long long time and they have never left me disappointed or dissatisfied. Overall great location, service, and food!"}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is one of those mid-priced restaurants, that could be considered a \"Nice Night out...\" or Exciting \"Brunch Experience\" --- but they're lacking, and I can't quite put my finger on where.   I love their muffins. Whatever bakery they ship those bad boys from, I wish I could buy whole sale. They are spectacular.   That being said, the rest of their menu comes with Fancy French names, Fancy French Prices, and American diner quality.   My Grandmother is a big fan of this place, so I do spend a lot of nights here with her. It seems to be a happening place for the 65+ crowd. Even as late as 7pm!   Every once in a while they celebrate by lowering certain menu prices to their price in the 70s which is great (59 cent muffins! I bought a dozen!)   I'm by no means a food snob, but please Mimis... if you're going to charge 12 dollars for a omelet, I shouldn't be tasting imitation cheddar."}
{"text":"Since the moment we walked in the service was outstanding. The hostess was very kind. Our server was awesome as well. He always made sure everything was good. I felt so bad since the people next us where being so rude, and despite that he never retaliated always kept a smile and positive attitude. I ordered the chicken tallook mac, very creamy and so delicious. Only ehh moments was when the manager walked around asking how everything was going but never approached our table or the other 2 tables, I just thought it was kinda rude, but no biggie :) overall very great night out with the Fam and great food."}
{"text":"Nothing like Mimosa's and breakfast with the people you love @ Mimi's Cafe!!! always my first choice!!!"}
{"text":"Good, small portions. Pricey for simple foods. Nice environment."}
{"text":"Was in Henderson looking for a burger and oddly enough, not many places came up in my search. I had given Mimi's a try in Jacksonville Florida about 7 or 8 years ago and remembered it being really good.   My memory served me correctly. I know it's weird to go go Mimi's for a plain hamburger and fries but that's really what I was in the mood for so I went for it. As always, they had the fresh bread served to the table and it was delicious.   I'll make sure to head back to Mimi's again when I'm feeling like trying one of their more exciting menu items but I definitely wasn't disappointed with my burger.   Give them a go!"}
{"text":"Stayed in the Holiday Inn next door for a couple days before I could move into my home. Woke up to walk a short distance next door to Mimi's and have breakfast with the family. I saw plenty of parking so it didn't look like it was going to be crowded. Walked in to the place where a hostess even came outside on our approach holding the door open for us. We were greeted and seated promptly. The menu looked awesome and ordered the eggs Benedict and a mimosa. Everything was right on and the waitress didn't really bother but came by enough times to check up to see if I needed anything. Price was average but for the taste, it was a bargain. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was awesome I love it here ordered the pancake breakfast and my husband the Denver .orange juice was awesome it just hit the spot. Only thing I didn't like was that when we ran out of milk and juice they said we don't do refill you have to pay. Come on I needed milk with the pancake I was choking I needed my milk of course I'm gonna pay hello put a sign in the entrance so people know what you don't cover .besides that was great"}
{"text":"mmmm not impressed.  the servers are always nice here but the food.... it could be better.  I do not necessarily blame the chefs/cooks; I just think Mimi's needs to bring real french flair ro their food; its just bland to me but I think all the Mimi restaurants suffer from that bland french food flavor."}
{"text":"Conveniently  located in desert ridge . Parking lot waa limited.  We were seated promptly  and offered drinks .The waiter took our order in about 7 minutes nut did not return with our order for 38 minutes   There was no apologies.  The food was decent I had their  corn beef hash. And eggs. I did like  the pineapple muffin.  . The place was busy  but the wait too long at 11.00 am"}
{"text":"every time I'm in Phoenix i go to Mimi's and it's been wonderful each time. great food, great staff. Wish there was one in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"This is a cozy place for breakfast, lunch, or even a late night dinner - especially the latter if you're hungry in the Metrocenter area late in the evening; the are open till 11 pm. The food is good but slightly pricy, and service is efficient and friendly.  While the decor seems to try to emulate a French bistro setting, the ambiance is more of a country cafe."}
{"text":"Wow what a find! Visiting family here in AZ from New York and chose this place for breakfast . Couldn't have made a better choice! First our server Kelly was friendly and excellent in all she did. The food was awesomely delicious. I had the eggs with salmon highly recommend, my sister the bacon avocado , niece the pancakes and brother in law the egg white omelet. All of us loved the food. Well prepared and well done. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant for all times of the day. We stopped I for dinner a few nights ago and we're surprised about the quality of the food.   We started with a spinach artichoke dip, it was delicious but really heavy.   I ordered the roasted chicken best and fries. With a house salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. Very flavorful.   My fiance ordered the salmon with fries and a french onion soup. She didn't care too much for the bread in the soup but she's not much of a bread eater.  For desert we ordered a cappuccino and a creme Brule cheese cake to go.  The cheese cake was very plain and felt like it needed to be elevated to match the quality of their entrées.   I'm only giving them 3 stars because the service was a bit slow. I had been offered bread from our waiter kiel and I had to remind him to bring it out. I had also found myself with an empty cup more than once.  All in all this is a really great place and the prices were good. I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible.  The place was empty.  We waited for fifteen minutes or more.  I finally asked if we could be seated in one of the many empty tables.  The answer was we do not have enough servers to seat you.  We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.  Maybe they should hire a few more waitresses.  These people did not care one bit if you waited forever.  The worst part was only a very few tables had customers.  This is the only complaint I have ever written.  I will never return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Waited awhile for food. Frank's soup came out 2 minutes before his dinner, so his dinner got cold while eating the soup. My dinner just came out cold and they are not even busy."}
{"text":"BOGO....I find that when a server is inefficient, they tend to use humor as a crutch. I can see right through that. Hope the food is good, I'm starved."}
{"text":"Seated pretty quickly in a smaller, quieter room off the main dining areas...:-) Good start- greeted quickly by my server and she took my order right away. Got my yummy mimosa (in a large wine glass!) quickly ! The entrée came in under 10 minutes, was hot and the poached eggs were perfect! I ordered Potatoe Cake Eggs Benedict and it was delicious! Can't quite finish it :-) Got a second mimosa(not in the larger wine glass that I like though) and am trying to supress my excited satisfaction.....the mimosas were 'brunch price' - ($5.00 on weekends) a great experience, I will be back! .....now to go home and have a nap."}
{"text":"It's what you think it is.  The food might be a skosh better, but the service a few trips worse.  I got a basic basic sandwich (french dip... though they called it \"classic beef dip\") because I really wasn't sure what this place could handle.  It was just fine, minus not really providing enough au jus for the whole thing (a common complaint of mine with this sandwich... so maybe it's just me!).  Our waitress... there are no words.  Well, maybe there are, but I need to stop and think for a sec.   Okay.  80% of the servers working in this establishment are 100+ lbs. overweight and look like 5-year-olds that got into their mommas' makeup.  Our particular waitress also looked like she was suffering from advanced gingivitis and gum recession.  The positive spin on this is that it really kills your appetite looking at servers like that.  She was distracted from the moment we sat down, acted like everything we said either bored her or posed some major imposition (or both).  When she brought our food, she set down one of three plates and then sneezed on the rest, followed by a loud, deep, long snort and wiping her whole face on her sleeve.  We were all shocked when she then went about her business, serving said sneezed-upon meals, without batting an eye.  I was utterly speechless.  My plate was the only non-sneezed-upon meal, so I offered to just split mine with my friends (there was certainly enough of it).  Jeez Louise.  I've never felt so shocked at such disgusting service... I mean, what on earth was she thinking??"}
{"text":"I am so sad- I used to be such a fan of Mimi's Cafe.  Large menu, reasonable prices, friendly service, good food... Now, many of those things seem to have gone downhill.  They still have a large menu with reasonable prices, but while our server was adequate, she was not friendly by any stretch of the imagination.  I don't think she smiled once while we were there- it was like she was a robot on autopilot.  One of my friends had a question about one of the items on the menu, and it was answered very curtly.    The food was.. okay.  I got the turkey, brie, and cranberry croissant sandwich, and it was fine.  A little on the dry side.  It came with French fries, and I swear, this was the most paltry serving of fries I've ever seen.  I know it was lunchtime, but jeez!! I kind of wanted to say, \"are you kidding?\"  My friends said that their food was fine, but nothing special.  I guess I'll have to cross Mimi's off my casual dining list.  So sad..."}
{"text":"Amanda was my server and she was cordial and checked up on me. I was in and out (I ate in) fairly quickly without having to ask for refills. The Food here was made well for a franchise chain cafe and I expected a lot less. I had belgian waffles and they were warm and soft but crunchy on the outside. The eggs were made to order and the turkey sausage was okay. I would come back if I was around in the area craving brunch food."}
{"text":"Lorraine, the server is an absolute hoot and was so friendly and efficient. She made a good lunch even better. :)"}
{"text":"Today we stopped in to try Mimi's again as we had stopped a few times since my review & the experience was not as nice as it had been... Not horrible but the staff was spread very thin & service on the patio was almost nonexistent.    Today we had Louis again ... He split our breakfast orders in half & plated half of each one for both of us.  No extra charge & we had only mentioned that we would be sharing.    The omelet was excellent & honestly I was full after finishing half of it so I brought my lovely mornay sauced spinach & egg crepe along with a mound of small potatoes home for my guy. He said it was delicious.   The server was extremely good, helpful, prompt & funny.  He told us he makes the best Mimosas... Thought that was funny as it consists of pouring Champagne into juice... Still he was suggesting it & even though we were not getting a Mimosa, he chatted in a friendly manner & gave us suggestions.   Food & cappuccino came out steaming hot.  Muffin came out warm & melted the butter... It was fresh & very nice!   Today it was a 5 star... I can't believe it because a couple times in the past when I did not Yelp, it was lucky to be a 3 star... So, in all fairness I have to say it is spotty & not consistent.  I hope this is the new Mimi's & the experience will be a 5 star every time.  Louis is excellent... Even better than he was on our last visit!"}
{"text":"The food is good I love it what I don't like is that I came in was asked to wait then an older white couple came in and was offered a table right away  Idk why maybe because we are Hispanic btw 2 people as well same as the older couple"}
{"text":"Mimi's has always been one of my favorite places to go for that smooth, jazzy-type ambience what with all of that neat \"french-inspired\" decor and shit. The food they serve is pretty hit or miss, but if you order the right thing (e.g buttermilk spice muffin and/or french onion soup) then you're probably going to enjoy your meal. When it came to the service though, I was rather disappointed. I waited 20 minutes to be seated, and there were only two other parties there! To add insult to injury, they actually sat another couple that came in after me before they sat me. Even after I was seated, they took a long time to take my order and run the food out. I should've been out of that restaurant a lot faster than I was. I could MAYBE argue that they're understaffed and that that's why the service was so bad, but like I said, it was a slow day for them business-wise. I've been to several other Mimis locations like the one's in Burbank and Anaheim, and I didn't have this problem. Overall, I think if you're looking to try out Mimis, don't try this location. They're not doing the brand a shred of justice."}
{"text":"Went here for a casual dinner with new friends after helping them with church stuff.  Mimi's was nearby and I was curious about it, since I'd never been there before.  The interior is cosy and could be described as a mashup between 1920s Paris and early 20th century New Orleans.  Casual and comfy.  I ordered the \"light\" tilapia with steamed veggies and brown rice: nothing spectacular, but I wanted a light meal and was craving some fish.  My husband had the chicken crepes, which were heavy and \"too creamy.\"  He also thought that the salad came with too much dressing.  Our dining companions all had the French onion soup and various accompaniments (fries, sliders, salad).  Not sure what was \"French\" about most of the menu....\"French fries\" and \"French onion soup\" isn't \"French.\"  To me, anyway....  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  Nice gal.  Mimi's won't be a go-to spot for me, as I like my restaurants to have that bit of pizzazz and spice, both literally and figuratively.  I don't often cite chain restaurants as go-to places and would much rather check out hole-in-the-wall joints and mom-and-pop eateries.  However, I am open to trying out mainstream establishments, if only to appease the tastes and comfort levels of friends!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent, went here with the wifey for dinner. We did have a gift card to use so we decided to stop by. It was surprisingly not busy and rather slow! Food was alright, not much selection going on but Twas tasty and had a good amount serving for the price. They theme them self as a French Tuscany style restaurant and somewhat olive gardenish if that makes any sense. The outside of the restaurant is well themed but inside the restaurant is a little more tamed down if you ask me. Nonetheless due to the lack of people inside on a Saturday night peak hour seemed like we walked in to a small town diner joint. Service was reasonable and quick especially for such a slow night, and waiters and staff were very nice and courteous. I would come back sometime...not my favorite of all places, but I definitely don't dislike it. Again food was good too."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Mimi's in so long and was very eager to come back. Atmosphere is the same, decor and sweet charm. There was a wait, for lunch time on a Monday. The food was still pretty great. I got a spice muffin which was wonderful and a soup and salad. I got a yummy house salad and French onion soup! Our server was nice, but we felt kinda like the odd ones out, coming between classes. Really great to be back. They also had a new banana muffin that I am eager to try!"}
{"text":"It is always a chore to find some place you can take kids under 5 for dinner and still get a cappuccino, a glass of wine or a broiled salmon for yourself without feeling like you are intruding on the date crowd or the adults..  I myself have been out with my friends at a steak house or bar and had a family with little kids complain that WE were too loud or obnoxious or \"adult\" for their kids...  of course when it happens.. i am  thinking.. \"well this is not a kid joint, people!\"   So, when i do take my niece and nephew out, i like to take them somewhere they can behave the way children do.. eat what they want (spaghetti, pizza, cheeseburgers etc) and still not feel like I am in truck stop diner...  This place is the perfect in-between.. not Dennys.. but not so \"fancy\" that little kids are treated like the plague.   In fact as soon as you are seated with little ones the hostess brings each child a snack plate with cheerios, orange slices, crackers, a bib and hand wipes..  this makes the children feel special and also suppresses the mad hungriness that makes little angels into screaming banchees while you are waiting for the server.  They have the usual kid menu with good choices for fruit, veggies and everything ranging from mini-corn dogs to pizza. (kid standard)  For the adults, they have a fairly good wine list, full bar, a good choice of cappuccinos and flavored coffee as well as some really good specialty drinks like the seasonal gingerbread martini.  The menu is pretty diverse, but I love that they do brown rice as a side to replace more high fat choices if you want.  Their bread basket is killer.  An assortment of cakes, muffin type bread and regular rolls that are way too tempting!  My broiled salmon was very good and the tomato bisque was nice. My sister had a salad and some clam puffs. The kids feasted on mini corn dogs, fruit and mini burgers.  I am a fan of their breakfast as well. I love that they serve chorizo and eggs, bennys and quiche.. but i am always tempted by their Belgian waffle! The great thing about breakfast here is that when they are busy, they have a selection of breads and coffee in the waiting area, so you can snack while you wait.  Anyway, if you are looking for a family restaurant that doesn't feel like a dummed down dive...  this is a good bet."}
{"text":"it pains me to give a national chain restaurant such a glowing review. i'm all about the small, unique, family-owned businesses. it does, however, ease my pain a bit to know that mimi's started out as a small, family run joint back in the '70's.  with that said, we frequent this particular mimi's because of its proximity to our home - 2 minute drive, with traffic.  food is always good. service is always above average. bread basket rocks my socks!!!  it also helps to sign up for their email program where you receive coupons for free meals and such.  i would give them 5 stars but on a recent visit here, we saw a server take a pepper shaker from the prep area and while attempting to screw the lid on it, dropped the lid on the floor, picked it up, blew on it and then proceeded to screw it back onto the shaker. SERIOUSLY!!! she even looked at me while i stared at her in total disgust but did nothing to change her actions. she placed that pepper shaker on a table and i feel for those people that ended up using it. gross!"}
{"text":"First, I'm sorry this review is lengthy, but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go.   I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley \"where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?\" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed. Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day besides the best part which is eggs Benedict. Everything else tasted awful. Service was bad."}
{"text":"I came to Mimi's with a friend of mine the other day and we enjoyed it! Our waitress was sweet and did seem to share some interest in making our time enjoyable. If anyone is looking for something that has a homestyle cooked meal with an authentic taste, I definitely recommend. The food took awhile to come out and there was a huge gash in the booth seat, but other than that, everything was good!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great tasting quality fresh everything foods.. Top shelve service & hospitality. We have breakfast here 3X's a week (like homemade). Always have great coupon deals (buy an entree get one free) if you signup for their Mimi's eClub om mimiscafe.com"}
{"text":"The Skinny: the food is okay not great (2) service: on a dead Saturday night with 3 tables,  service was completely pathetic (1) Mimi's cafe used to provide decent food and service at reasonable prices. How times have changed (1).  We used to come every so often to gorge on fried zucchini sticks which were one of the best things on their menu. However,  major revamping of their menu eliminated our favorite appy so we haven't been back for a while.  We got a coupon for BOGO entrees with drink purchase so we decided to hit the joint on Saturday night.  When we got in the place was completely dead. There were 3 tables not including us and a room filled with booths with dirty dishes everywhere. Not a good sign about the service.   We were seated at a table with some menus. Our table was bare except for condiments. It took 10 minutes prior to being asked about drink orders. It took another 10 minutes to get our orders in after which our meager bread basket came out.   I don't recall much about Mimi's but I do remember the nice bread basket with three different choices. Oh how times have changed! Now, there's only a sad doughy \"baguette\" and the ever present carrot bread with very scarce walnuts now (small portion sizes too).   At this time, our drink orders were still not filled and we still had no utensils. It took another 5-10 minutes to get those and only after asking for them. In addition, our server was largely MIA in terms of checking up on refills of our drinks. This is despite asking multiple times directly for refills and where she either completely ignored us (walked by us) or forgot.   From then on,  we had a 20 minute wait for the $2.50 side salad and our waitress forgot the side of soup was ordered. My salad was pretty horrible. Limp spring mix on the verge of complete dehydration/mushiness. The hubs said his soup was okay.   Our entrees came out about 10 minutes later. We both got a grilled salmon dish ($13.99) -  mine was with fries and the hubs was with roasted potatoes and cream sauce. The salmon was okay. The fries were soggy from the spinach on the plate... Meh. The roasted potatoes were on top of a horrible goopy sauce for the hubs.   By this time,  we had enough. The slow substandard service when there appeared to be at least 3 wait staff plus a manager hovering around to service 3 tables is unacceptable. (apparently our server was the only one doing the serving... Why?)   We asked for our check. We had previously told our server that we wanted to use our coupon but she said her manager had to review it first. That did not happen.  So when we finally got our check? No discount was on it. Frustrated,  we had to say it again. Finally the other server appears and looks at out coupon and provides us with the proper total. After that we put our card on the check. From the looks of things she probably forgot to pick it up so I took the initiative and handed it to her at her workstation. I did not feel like I wanted to spend the night sleeping at Mimi's.  We finally got out of there 1 hour and 15 minutes after we arrived. We vowed we were never going to Mimi's again. With the non-existent service and relatively expensive price for the mediocre quality food,  there is absolutely no reason to return given the plethora of restaurants in the area (Cheesecake Factory,  Claim Jumper.... Heck even Feast buffet offers better quality food for the less money on their Prime Rib night). Considering the piss poor job management has done,  I would not be surprised if this restaurant's days are numbered. Sorry Mimi's... You made it into my +1 starred review list."}
{"text":"I've been to various Mimi's around the country, but something seemed \"off\" about this one.  Americans are overfed and our restaurants and fast food joints give us portions that are just way too big. But this location, the portions are too small. I was dining with nine other people, and all of us were left wondering if we accidentally ordered an appetizer.   I had the soup and half a sandwich. You're given about half a cup of soup and out of the sandwich choices I opted for the turkey on rye. I think when I said rye the waitress heard wheat (we'll get to her later) so I was given a small sandwich (about size of an iphone) toasted with the crust cut off.  My waitress was a hot mess. I don't blame Mimi's, it was hers. I came a little late and as soon as I sat down, she came over to take my drink order. I ordered water and hot tea. Within seconds she was back with my water and a wooden display with various types of tea and honey. But no tea cup. She said she'd be right back with it. She came to take our orders and I reminded her about the tea cup. She came back to deliver the sparkling champagne some ordered. I reminded her about the tea cup. She delivered some salads. I reminded her about the tea cup. Finally, after about 40 minutes of this, I went to the bar and got it myself. Of course, as soon as I walked back with it, the waitress says \"I was just about to go get it!\"  Back to my sandwich. I ordered the turkey on rye with no cheese, add mustard the sandwich comes with mayo, tomato and lettuce. The sandwich was delivered to me with nothing between the bread (wheat, not rye) but turkey. No mustard, no mayo, no tomato, no lettuce. When I asked my waitress what the deal was, she didn't get rude, but she did insist that that's the way I ordered the sandwich. She messed up all 10 orders. Each time she insisted that she had taken our ordered exactly as we'd given them to her. Again, she wasn't rude, but it was obnoxious.  Of course when the check came it was another hot mess express from our dear waitress.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Bruce and I went to look at one of our listings in that part of town last week, God what a horrible little home. Well we decided we should reward ourselves for putting our senses in such shock that we decided to go to Mimi's.   Bruce being such a picky eater he does not have many places he will go. And by picky I mean odd.   Any-road I have not been in several years and it was just as I remembered. A nice filling sandwich and cup of soup. It was all good and the service was just spiffy too. In fact when I asked where the rest room is, I was taken by hand and led there. A little strange actually, but great service."}
{"text":"The service was terrible,they didn't bring bread out when every table around had it.. My chicken crepes were as cold as the salad it came with..doubt I will go back. I would have complained about the cold crepes,but no one asked how they were and I was so hungry,I didn't want to eat hot food after my party was done with theirs....not sure this really even deserves 2 stars,maybe I.5"}
{"text":"Called to order food for pickup twice. Was put on hold for over 15 minutes, received a busy signal when I finally hung up and called back. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We went to this Mimi's location earlier this year. There were 5 adults and 2 kids in our party. The service was so slow...never saw anything like it before. About 45 minutes after ordering, two people at our table got their food. Another 15 minutes later, 3 more. By now, the kids in our group were getting pretty bored and restless. We decided to give up and leave, at which time they brought out the food for the last two people at our table, which we had them pack to go. And the food? Not great. In an attempt to appease us, the manager took a few drinks off of our bill. Big whoop. I've been to other Mimi's, and liked them very much. This one must have a management problem or something. I doubt we'll be going back. If we do, it will be sans young children."}
{"text":"Eh...food was not great to say the least I ordered the hibachi plate with chicken the chicken was microwaved and Luke warm along with the rice and vegetables for $15+ I think it should have had more then 8 slivers of chicken. I told the waiter it wasn't grilled he agreed took it back and the manager came running out of the kitchen to correct me that it was grilled. He proceeded to argue when I told him I don't want it. I then ordered the turkey it was ok nothing to go back for. Whatever happened to cooking on premises? This is clearly a pre packaged microwave restaurant. Very disappointed always liked Mimi's."}
{"text":"Feels a slight bit pricey, but overall tasty food and very friendly service. That about sums it up I think. Not remarkable, but definitely good enough."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at Mimi's Café many times over the years. The service in the PAST was great! HOWEVER things have changed!!!   It was decided to update the menu which resulted in a big change. I attempted to order my usual Swiss Cheese omelet with bacon. The new menu did not list this--oh they had omelets but with ingredients I do not want with eggs. I attempted to order the Swiss Cheese/Bacon omelet but was warned it would be costly. I would have to order a plain omelet with added cheese and bacon. Ok, I thought for a minute and ordered one of their omelets with all the stuff I did not want BUT had them REMOVED everything but the cheese/bacon. Toast and hash browns were included.  The order arrived without the toast and hash browns--they'll be right out---I was told. NOT! Do I leave the omelet to get cold or start eating? I decided to start, the toast arrived when the omelet was half way gone but no hash browns! Oh, the kitchen is making a new batch, really? They arrived when I was finished with my meal.  The moral of this review, if you have a restaurant with a good working menu and want to destroy your business, change the menu into something that just doesn't work. We will NEVER return to Mimi's Café!"}
{"text":"Not quite as good as it once was.  Seems a bit tired.  Food was not presented well and lacked flavour.  But it is still ok, just not great."}
{"text":"I like this chain because they serve breakfast all day. Our server, Lauren was very nice and attentive. Their breads/muffins are super good, so any time I feel like binging out on carbs or eating pancakes for dinner I'll come here."}
{"text":"Horrible place ! Smells like mold , old and dirty!  I'm a lactose intolerant and Vegan , that was my first visit to Mimi's Cafe and the last one for sure !  I asked for a vegan option and the waitress suggested their veggie burger, I asked over and over agin if she's sure it's dairy and eggs free , meaning vegan and not just vegetarian. She went to \"check \" and said that it's for sure vegan ... The food finally arrived, in my first bite I realized that there is a cheese inside the petty !!!!!!! The manager offered me a fruit cup instead my dinner... lol ... wake up ! Vegan don't eat only fruits and veggies!  If u hungry.. just find a better place!"}
{"text":"we love Mimi's delicious and affordable pricing! My family feels at home when we visit desert ridge location. They treat you like family! I went to several locations and in 5 Years regardless of staff we are treated well I go 3 times a week."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for her favorite eggs benedict. It was a bit late for breakfast but they still served it at 2 pm. The food was great, servings large and service prompt and attentive. They even offered eggs benedict with salmon instead of ham. But the Sam Adams French Onion soup - BEST EVER! I could have made that the whole meal. Nice atmosphere. I had the turkey reuben which was perfect for me since I quit eating beef. Huge sandwich but tasty. Made me a winner in my wife's eye which was well worth it."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  They seated my party of 5 adults in a booth that shouldn't hold more than 4 so we were cramped eating lunch but there were no open tables that could accommodate us. Refills on water were sparse."}
{"text":"My server Rachael was phenomenal! She is so on top of everything and was happy to be there for the customer! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for kids.  It is one of my \"go to\" places when we are with the twins.  Food is good, the service is friendly and fast and our kids like it.  We go at least once a month."}
{"text":"The server was not friendly at all, the manager was rude when I asked him Bout the turkey dinner. I had ordered the turkey dinner the turkey was processed the manager insisted it was not however i know the taste of processed turkey as I had bought it from the grocery store... Definitely not worth the money!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow. Server forgot parts of order and had to remind her several times. Pancake, at 2.00 was dry and flavorless. And, no salsa?? What gives with this?  Honestly, we get a much better deal and meal at Dennies! Stay away from this place Ohh, had to go find the wait staff to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & all day breakfast :) Chicken & waffles were delicious.  I paired it with a mimosa and coffee"}
{"text":"Never had a problem with food or service. Great portions and the bread is yummy! The raspberry ice tea is my favorite. All in all one of my favorite places to have breakfast on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"We got gift certificates from Mimi's Cafe.  Took them in Glendale AZ on Bell Road where our problem started.  WE had excellent service from Roseann and everything was correct and cooked right.  We got offered dessert and coffee.  We are so pleased to see a business fix a problem we will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to Mimi's several times and at many different locations around the valley. I enjoy going there for breakfast as I am not a huge fan of their lunch selections. I love their Mixed Berry Pain Perdu, which is stuffed french toast, their turkey sausage is very good as well and lets not forget their Sunrise Pomosa to wash it all down with! While I am a fan of their breakfast I will have to say that it didn't matter which Mimi's location I was at they definitely lack in service, our waiter/waitress was rarely around and if you needed refills on your drinks you had to flag down another employee just to have them ask your waiter/waitress for you. Overall its a place to go for breakfast when you are not in hurry!"}
{"text":"Buy one get one free coupons are the only reason my husband and I go to Mimi's, but after tonight, I doubt that we will return.  Slow, nonexistent server, barely warm French dip sandwich and fries (even the au jus was lukewarm) and flat soda.  Slow service is forgivable, but top it off with cold food and flat soda, and your buy one, get one free meal is ruined."}
{"text":"Great food, passed my expectations. Good coffee and pastries as well, and the server was nice. Cozy clean environment, felt like a little taste of France."}
{"text":"Good for a quick meal. Comfort food. My favorite is there Corn Chowder soup with bread basket. Breakfast and lunch items are reasonably priced with good portions."}
{"text":"Please please please bring back the old Menu. I dont whats up with this french inspired cuisine going on????? Mimi's was known for good ole comfort food!! Was not happy when we got the menu and will not be going back until the menu changes again...."}
{"text":"Wife and I both had the steak frites and let me say it was horrorable.  We asked for medium rare and the wife got rare with a whole lot of fat as did I.  Potatoes tasted a bit on the burnt side and it didn't come with any veggies at all.  I think I had more fat then steak.  If it wasn't for the bogo I would have gone somewhere else for dinner.  This place is hit and miss all the time since they got bought out.  French onion soup was very under cooked and not very tasty.   Have to think about coming back to here to eat again.  Not pleased."}
{"text":"this establishment has a kind, and comforting feel. Our waitress messed up a simple salad, so my mom and I waited forever just for them to take the tomatoes off. The table behind us also had so many problems we overheard. It seemed like we weren't the only one's she messed up the order on. She had her manager bring over their food but not ours. Hmmm, so whoever makes a bigger fuss gets free food. Wow, thats interesting. The food is very good though."}
{"text":"My family and I will never go back there again! I never noticed this place before, even though it's close to my house, but saw they were honoring veterans with a free meal from a special menu with the purchase of a non-alcoholic drink. So I took my family to try it out.   We get there and wait for several minutes without even a \"boo\" from any of the staff that keep looking in our direction. Finally the manager comes over and seems lost as to where to put us because we have a stroller. Keep in mind the place was dead. Maybe 3 or 4 other tables with customers at them. We get sat and then other people start showing up. Our waiter visits every other table that came in after us \"twice\" before coming to us, even though we are sitting there clearly waiting for him. When he comes over I ask him about the special Veterans Menu and he chuckles and says \"yeah, we have one, why are you a veteran?\" Yeah dumb ass, why the f do you think I'm asking... So I show him my ID and he gets the menu, hands it to me and asks me what I want even though I literally had 2 seconds to look at it.   Moving on, we order and when the food comes out my burger is almost raw and my girlfriend asked for some parmesan cheese for her pasta. We wait, and wait but it never comes so she just decides to eat because we have our baby and can't be there all night. We are both finished with our meals and he finally comes with the cheese and laughs thinking it's funny we never got it.   I tell him bring me the check and when he does I see he charged me for my meal. I question it and he tells me I was supposed to buy \"2\" beverages. Ummmm NOPE! I showed him the advertisement and even referred to the menu he gave me, it says I have to buy \"A Drink\", not 2. So he goes back and talks to the manager (who really shouldn't be even managing a dog wash) and tells him what I said. The manager then comes out and trys to tell me I was given an $8 burger when the deal was only for a $5 burger. Wait, the f you say!? I order the damn burger from the \"special menu\" your incompetent waiter gave me. A menu that had no prices on it, just 3 options for a free meal to choose from... At this point I'm pissed and just want to leave bit he tells me (as if he did me some sort of favor) that he went ahead and discounted my check the $5 I was supposed to get (but I was still charged the other $3), and by the way, the Sprit also cost $3.50. So basically, it wasn't a free meal and the meal I paid for wasn't even good enough for my dog.   I left a ZERO tip and will NEVER, EVER go back to this place again! There are far too many restaurants out there to try rather than giving a place like this a second chance. The entire experience just went from bad to worse and they clearly don't honor vets. In fact, it actually feels like they are trying to scam us. If you're a vet, go somewhere else. Their so called \"fee meal\" isn't free and a hot dog from 7-11 will taste better."}
{"text":"I don't like chain restaurants because they almost always disappoint. The food is bland and tastes prepackaged and/or overly salty, the portions are strange (either way too much or hardly enough french fries to cover the plate) and the service isn't the best.   Mimi's is no exception.   My girlfriend and my friend and I came here around lunch time on a Saturday afternoon because it is close to my house and none of us felt like driving very far. I immediately regretted the decision once I started looking at the menu and watching the food travel through the hands of the waiters in our section.   My girlfriend ordered cinnamon french toast. It was dry and took too much effort to chew and eat. My friend ordered some type of eggs benedict. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with fries and a cup of tomato soup.   You can't really mess up a grilled cheese sandwich, right? That's what I thought. Yet, somehow, they were able to make it taste bland and dry. The fries were okay, but I only received about a handful of them. The waiters and chef see the plates before they are taken out to the tables, right? They can tell the plate looks like it was thrown together by a three year old, right? Awful.    The tomato soup is the only thing worth talking about because it is pretty consistently good. And it is probably the only thing on the menu that is consistently good and the only reason why this review gets more than one star. It is also the only reason I was able to enjoy my grilled cheese sandwich (dipping - yum!)  Another thing that really bothers me: waiters who are obviously trying to sell you something. We said we didn't want any drinks. You don't have to tell me or ask me 4 more times if I want to try the new mimosas.  I already ordered a diet soda and a water. And I already said no - politely. Please don't make me feel like I'm walking through a used car lot on President's Day.   And I'm usually not extremely critical of service... but seriously, guy? And to top it off, the service was extremely slow.  Every time I go to a chain restaurant, I regret it. Never again. And honestly, guys, with so many other mom and pop-type places opening up, spending $10-20/person at Mimi's really isn't worth it.   Make them step their game up before you eat here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner after winning some money at Sunset Station. The resto was filled with new orleans mardi gras-esque decor which looked like they came from Hobby Lobby across the street. At first, I was curious what genre of food Mimi's Cafe serves. When I checked out the menu, it was mostly french and american style comfort food (think if Bouchon and Claim Jumper had a baby). They had steak frites, pot roast, french onion soup, coq au vin, chicken pot pie, bouillinaise, etc. I had the turkey dinner with stuffing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli as my side. My wife had the grilled salmon and frites. Both of our dishes were great. The turkey was REAL turkey that was moist and flavorful. My wife's salmon was grilled perfectly and their fries were fresh and crispy. I would come back here again to try the rest of their menu as this place has great comfort food. They also have a nice breakfast menu which looked a little pricey but Ill try it out one day. Merci Mimi's...."}
{"text":"I always forget this place exists, I'm not sure really why but I do. Same with Marie Callender's. It's very American cuisine and maybe thAts the problem? It's not very memorable. This is a 3.8 review.  Don't get me wrong the food is great but it's not amazing and it's not something I can't make at home. Meatloaf? Mash potatoes? Yep, I have my grandmothers recipes, and I'm half white, I got it down thanks.  What's great is the customer service, the food is out in less than 15 minutes, warm bread to your counter, but not any bread, it's muffin bread usually. The spices in the muffin are unusual and flavorful. They have large plates of food, and coupons they mail you, trick you I'm. Those coupons always get me in at least. Buy one get one is a good deal.  If you like all American food, such as chicken fried steak, French dips, burgers,  soups, etc then this is your place. I like more variety. I'm more a Mexican food eater. The Caesar salad is really good, not too much dressing and there was the perfect amount of cheeses. Prices are overall reasonable.    Side note, the desserts are rich, creamy and savory goodness. Go for the trio! I'm not a bread pudding fan but my husband loved it. Too soggy for me. The other too were right on the money. Especially the chocolate lava cake.   Impressed with the bar, which has seating for disabled patrons too, which vie never seen before, awesome.   My update will be for breakfast."}
{"text":"This was one place I wanted to try before I left Las Vegas.  I went here for breakfast and was disappointed.  I was only the second customer in the restaurant and ordered a basic breakfast of eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast.  The problem began when my breakfast was placed on my table.  I ordered my eggs over medium.  They were not only incompletely cooked, but were completely runny/snotty/disgusting eggs.  This place touts their breakfast but can't cook eggs properly.  I won't be back.  It just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Last time to eat here!  Terrible service,food has OK at best,but for the price,it should have been a LOT better.  My wife's coffee cup had lipstick marks on it,waitress got her another cup,but wasn't that concerned about it.   Shame on them!"}
{"text":"Where to start... Food was terrible! I ordered the bacon avocado omelette which comes with potatoes. I ordered a side of turkey sausage links with toast and blueberry muffin.  The omelette had no flavor, it was plain and with literally 2 pieces of avocado. There was not enough bacon or avocado or tomatoes in the omelette. I basically was just eating 3 eggs. The cheese was disgusting.  My niece ordered the bacon and turkey crepes with potatoes. The crepes had mushrooms which we clearly stated to the waitress no mushrooms so she had to take back and remake. My niece hated the crepes. She said it was not what she expected. No flavor whatsoever on both meals. The freshly made blueberry muffin tasted too much like dough. I think they changed cooks because the first time k tried it all the food was delicious and full with flavor. Definitely won't be coming back. :(   $40 to only like the sausage links. The toast was burnt :("}
{"text":"Today I ordered a Cobb Salad from the only restaurant that delivers to where I work in this area. I won't mention them by name, but it was a local pizza shop. After having to spend a minimum of $15 before tax and tipping the driver. When my order finally got here, the salad was old, brown and disgusting and they got the side that I had to order just to meet the minimum spend for delivery wrong. $21 for a lunch that I couldn't eat. Did I mention that I was starving?! So I went 3 min down the street to Mimi's Cafe on Fort Apache. I got a beautiful sandwich, tomato soup and fresh fruit for half of what I paid at the other place.   Mimi's, you are one of my favorite restaurants for a reason. You never disappoint. Thank you for such great service and always fresh and delicious menu choices."}
{"text":"So glad to write this review as I'm picky when it comes to huge, good salads!  After mediocre take out from other places where they consider 4 leaves of lettuce a salad, Mimi's off of the 101 and Shea is awesome! I get the same thing, to-go everytime: cobb salad - big sissy style (extra lettuce ;-). They're amazing. Always so nice and give me enough so that I'm not starving after...and I can eat.  Thanks so much for giving customers what they want: quality with quantity and a smile!"}
{"text":"They left my soup out so I was disappointed, they remade my whole order which was nice of them so for that I'll give them a good review. And they have us a gift card so that's a bonus. Good customer service"}
{"text":"We used to eat here quite a bit, but it's not as good as it once was. The last time we visited I got mussels and French fries. Both were cold. When waitress asked if everything was okay and I said yes but cold. I guess she told manager and he came to ask me, I said it's okay, but he brought me really hot fries but didn't offer to heat up the mussels. My hubby likes to come for the carrot muffins, we usually take some home. While vacationing in California at the ocean, we met our neighbor who owns this particular Mimi's. I don't think he is a hands on owner because he has never been there. I thought well I guess if it fails it's a tax right off. But I don't think its managed well as I read so many complaints here on yelp. We used to enjoy the Mimi's in Colorado but will avoid this one. It does look like they have a new menu, so I will be checking reviews for more satisfied customers."}
{"text":"Mimi's is great! They have everything and we've made this our go to. It seems no groups can decide what they want to eat, so we go to Mimi's. No matter what you're in the mood for, they've got it. So everyone's always happy. A great way to start out a long night on the town."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with friends. I lunch on the lighter side, tomato basil soup and the bacon & blue cheese salad with chicken. The salad was good,bit had all of my fave ingredients which is why I ordered it. The soup was just okay. I was expecting a little more flavor, instead it tasted like spaghetti sauce. Needless to say I won't be ordering the tomato basil soup anymore. Our server was great but service was pretty slow and the restaurant wasn't even crowded. My favorite thing about Mimi's is that on Friday'd they have a $5 flight of mimosas. It's not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. The flight includes hibiscus, mango and orange juices."}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation of friends, we had breakfast at this Mimi's Cafe in Glendale, AZ. They are still our friends. The server Cindy was on top of her game; very experienced to include detailed suggestions and knowledge of the various dishes/combinations, and her timing to check on us was spot-on. We had a standard eggs/potatoes/bacon meal and the breakfast tacos. Everything was delicious and very fresh. The bread/toast was awesome. The manager was cruising all the tables to ensure everyone was happy. We found it difficult to believe this is a chain restaurant. Decor was comfortable and clean. We'll be back soon for lunch and dinner to explore the menu. Already planning some group meals in the near future. Sincerely, Karen & Art (Karts) Huseonica, Sun City, AZ"}
{"text":"Just went there tonight for Thanksgiving dinner with a few friends.  Never been there before.  We all (obviously) ordered the 3-course turkey dinner.  They bring you breadsticks and some kind of banana nut bread, and that was awesome.  For a starter, I chose a cup of French onion soup - very average tasting, but at least it wasn't too salty, as some French onion soup can be.  Then the main course arrived - generous portions of turkey, plus bowls of cranberry sauce, stuffing, green bean casserole, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes.  Cranberry sauce was excellent - fresh cranberries, too.  I got all white turkey meat, and it was delicious - not dried out at all.  Mashed potatoes were pretty standard but on the better side.  Stuffing was a bit underdone for my taste, but still tasty.  Everything else was pretty good.  I ordered pecan pie for desert, and it was one of the BEST pecan pies I've ever had!  The filling was \"runnier\" not in a bad way than most pecan pies I've had, and it had was just so delicious.  A guy called Leroy waited on us, and he was fun and personable.  Naturally, it was very busy, being Thanksgiving, but it did not disappoint.  Not the best place I've ever eaten at, but it was one of the better places - I'd say try it; you'll probably like it."}
{"text":"Great food! I was looking for another place to go for breakfast besides dennys or ihop.. And tried Mimis and it was good! Food tasted great.. Not too pricey.. And the decor was easing! Had a good time"}
{"text":"The last few times I have been here the food is meh. I use to really like Mimi's but I am giving up on it for awhile."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Came here for my friends baby shower. I guess they have a room where you can hold a party/event. They serve breakfast, lunch & dinner.   I ordered the steak well done and when I got it, it was rare. They sent it back to cook longer but it took awhile. Everyone was basically done eating. But after my steak was cooked longer it tasted amazing and the broccoli & mash potatoes was good. Just need to add some salt. My sister had the parmesan crusted chicken pasta. The chicken was really good, you can't go wrong with chicken."}
{"text":"I'm going for a 4, but I really feel this is more of a 3.5.....better to over-state than under in fairness.  My first visit was a to-go order. The phone call seemed to go almost too smoothly. That should have been my first clue. One order had chopped sausage inside the omelette, instead of links ON THE SIDE. The second order had shell pieces in the fried egg. The third order was for fresh fruit (I asked specifically if there were berries) and instead was fresh melon and orange wedges! I will say the muffins were amazing as always and totally worth going off my gluten-free restriction for!  Second visit was because the manager was quick to want to resolve the first debacle - nice job, Fernando! Very professional in his approach and made it easy for me, at my convenience, to come by for a do-over :) HOWEVER, although the food was exactly as we ordered for this breakfast, we got to hear the waitress calling out that her customers said their food was to be comped.....calling out across the whole dining room! WTH?! Not so professional on that level :(  All said, my impression is that the manager knows he has a kitchen and wait staff that might be rough around the edges and also understands customer loyalty is critical to a good business model.  I'll return for lunch and see if we can't make this a solid 4 stars or even 5 :)"}
{"text":"I really like this Mimi's, it seems nicer than the one we used to frequent in/near Summerlin. Very friendly staff, clean amenities, and the food is about what I would expect for the prices. My husband hates the coffee here, other than that, it's all good!"}
{"text":"On Saturday June 3rd, I called to place an order for pick up at Mimi's - we had never been! First, KYLE answered the phone and was so cheery and helpful! He informed me the old menu was online, but offered to help me out best he could. I was close so I went inside to see a menu.   Long story short, the food was amazing, even when we got around to eating it a half and hour after we got home. I can only imagine it straight from the kitchen. Seriously, there must be 10 grandma's in the kitchen, it is such good real food! The muffins are to die for. Moist and large and sooo delicious.   Honestly, Kyle is the star here, though. As a staff training consultant, I know a good employee when I see one and he is on point. Happy, helpful, and just a welcoming air about him. He made our first experience great and is the reason we will return. Give him a raise."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here today, it seems like they updated the menu, and for the better, with more omelettes and a breakfast burrito (which they let me change from steak to chicken).  The pumpkin muffin was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant setting. it's quiet without all the birthday songs and they have nice bread gratuitously. The service was good, and the food fresh without being over seasoned.  Overall they got my vote."}
{"text":"Again the food was excellent and the service was even better, I just wish it was closer to home. For the best seat in the house , sit at the bar, very entertaining"}
{"text":"I love this place. My brother's girlfriend took me out for a girl's brunch and my the end of the meal I was ready to call her family. Partly because of her picking this location. First it's a beautiful building, looks like some beautiful cottage wrongly placed in this city. Greeted warmly as soon as me enter and they should us to a lovely booth. I'll wait hours for a booth! There were so many great things on the menu it was so hard to choose. I finally decided on the French Toast breakfast with turkey sausage and grapefruit juice. I love that they have a non-pork alternative for breakfast. (Other places should take note.)  As we chatted I looked around the room and it made me feel like I was in some over sized European cafe. All it was missing was outdoor seating. And the smell was great - not that over cleaned cafeteria smell like some places. Just coffee, pancake, sweet fruit - gave the feeling like there could have been a small garden in the back (there isn't that's the parking lot).   Additional the servers were very attentive. They seem to float in and out so smoothly we never had to ask for anything because they already had it done. I think we went at the perfect time, when walking out we could see a big crowd and a line building outside. But this place is definitely worth the wait.   Last note - they even have a cute bathroom take the time to look at the walls."}
{"text":"This morning was our 2nd time going to eat at Mimi's. Their customer service is amazing and the food is delicious. We took all of our kids, they love the muffins. Try their chicken and waffles, the chicken is the best chicken breast I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing great. We ordered the wedge salad, clam chowder soup and each had the top serloin. I asked for mine to be MW and it came out extra well done. It was tough and dry. For this price I think Fridays has much better steak.  Service was not fantastic. Our waiter had a ton of tables which is understandable why service was slow. He tried to be friendly I think but wasn't stellar. On our $50 check my boyfriend gave him a whopping $16 tip. I don't know why he did that but the waiter actually came outside after us and thanked us. That's cool in my book!   So, nothing special here. Maybe other dishes are better but it wasn't good enough for us to come back again."}
{"text":"This has been a tradition for a couple of years now.  A few of the twin moms get together for breakfast around  10am after shopping or volunteering at the big consignment semi-annual sale we have each april and october.  This year, I did not volunteer or shopped, however I couldn't pass up this tradition.  I love to hang out with my girlfriends at any opportunity I get.  This year the group was a little smaller, however we always have a great time.  Of course, I had to have the mimosa flight.  Mimi's is always consistent and very accommodating.  Yes, it is a chain, but service is always friendly and the food is food, although always too much.  This branch is a little farther for me, so I will see you back in October."}
{"text":"The wife and I had an outdated coupon, \"One entrée free when another entrée\" is purchased. The waitress, Susan had to follow the expiration date, which was O.K.   When we both had the roast beef sandwiches my wife mentioned she would keep 1/2 of the sandwich for our daughter, who was receiving chemo treatments for her breast cancer. Susan shared that her best friend died of colon cancer - She was very compassionate as we shared that we were in our 70's. At our time to receive the invoice to pay for the scrumptious meal - Susan had brought two quarts of the restaurants best soup, French onion. Also, there were 4 assorted muffins. Susan said the extra soup and muffins would be for our daughter. Our daughter has lost her hair - so she doesn't like to come out in the public. Susan definitely played a special part in  our daughters surprise when we returned to our home. And her favorite muffins along with the onion soup gave her a reason to smile, as smiling in the midst of chemo treatments and the cleansing of the ports they implanted into her left arm. Janice went out of her way to make our daughters day end joyfully. It really touched our hearts to not only have a perfect lunch, but to have our waitress really go the extra mile to extend her joy of life - our daughter that wasn't as fortunate to be able to eat as we had  at Mimi's."}
{"text":"While the food here is good, the service needs a lot of improvement. I have never had to wait so long for a server to come by and wait on our table. This is my second time coming here because I believe in giving the benefit of the doubt to restaurants. But this is the second time I've had to wait over 20 minutes to have the server even acknowledge us and the only reason the server acknowledged us was because we went ant GOT them! That's not service!  If I wanted to get my own food I'd stay home and cook. But every now and again you want a special treat, not having to cook on a Sunday morning is one of them."}
{"text":"This place was way better than I expected. Walking in, I thought this was going to be similar to Denny's restaurant. I had a grilled cheese sandwich and French onion soup and both were great. The grilled cheese sandwich was not so great on its own, but I was able to dip it into my friends tomato basil soup and that was delicious! The tomato basil soup is nice and thick and made a perfect dipping!   My husband had the mussels and it was more than enough for one person. Lots of sauce!  You can order a bottle of wine, have a glass of it and take the rest to go which is great! We ordered the sirloin steak for my daughter, but it was not very good at all. Most of it went completely uneaten. The fries were great though. The steak is just not a very good cut, it came out raw and then came back again and anytime a steak is cooked twice I think it loses more flavor than necessary.  I would definitely return here to try something different. I'm curious about their salmon, chicken Parmesan, and their chicken sandwich. Lots to try for next visit!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here this morning and was disappointed in the visit.  First cup of coffee barely hot, second was good however.  As an artificial sweeteners user we were disappointed that REAL Sweet & Low and Equal were replaced by generic ones. The pumpkin muffin was dry and my wife questioned if they are made fresh daily. Our omelet was not that hot either.  Side of two pancakes were not of uniform size and not as good as they used to be. $20 for a below average meal, not worth it."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated outside; clean.  A door attendant opens the door for u, smooth/classy.  The attendant & host were nice gentlemen.  Nice decor, clean, nice jazz music playing.  Clean bathroom, nicely decorated.  Easy to read menu.  Nice selections.  I ordered the chicken & waffles with a side of egg whites.  Partner ordered cheese omelette which came with toast & these to die for potatoes.   Everything was superb, tasteful.  Javier was our server; fun, nice, pleasant, professional.  I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have ever been to.  It was our first time here.  They brought us bread and butter in a PAPER container!  You know, those containers you get at a fast food joints for ketchup.  Very unclassy.  We then ordered french onion soup, calamari, and the mussels.  We had to send back the french onion soup because it tasted like tomato sauce.  I have had delicious french onion soup before so I knew the difference right away.  The calamari was cold and had cheese all over it and the breading was gross!  The mussels were not good at all, and left a gross after taste in my mouth.  At that point we felt really bad to return 2 more dishes, but this will be first and last time we ever come here.  Please, if you are craving good delicious French food, go else where.  This place will disappoint you."}
{"text":"Eva is a great server. Breakfast was delicious! I had a bacon avocado omelet with half an avocado on top! Completed their survey and got 2 muffins to go. Try it."}
{"text":"Read in the paper this location has closed! It was a decent place to eat at the handful of times I went there. Hope something good goes in its place fast."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet and eat. Love the Santa Fe omlet or Corned Beef Hash. Servers are usually very friendly and my meals have always been served quickly and hot."}
{"text":"I was sold when I read \"sparkling strawberry\". This refreshing twist will make you forget all about the traditional mimosa! Also, I cannot believe how big the breakfast muffins are they're huge and warm too!! Paired with seasoned red potatoes and cheese eggs, this was a delicious and filling Mother's Day brunch; well worth the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"The wife and I are always on a quest to find something different to eat, and we decided we would give Mimi's a try.  The first impression felt like I walked into a beautiful home, it had a nice and comfortable decor and for it being a Saturday afternoon wasn't that busy. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated which was really nice.  At first glance of the menu I was alittle overwhelmed there was so much to look at and since I don't speak French I had a hard time deciding what was what being that most of the dishes have French names and not all of em have pictures but thankfully the waitress we had was very friendly and answered all our questions  My wife had the bouillabaisse and I had the quiche Lorraine both were first times trying these dishes and we were both absolutely stunned at how delicious it was!! The bread they give was scrumptious and the muffins were heavenly!!   I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"The Ultimate Worst Service.  Of all my years of experiencing and providing customer service, I have just experienced service that has left me completely speechless and quite dumbfounded. My mom (with a broken foot and on crutches) and I decided to stop at Mimi's for a quick lunch.  I will never EVER step foot in that restaurant again. I will encourage and spread the word of the worst experience and shittiest humans (2 of them at least) who work there to anyone who suggests going to Mimi's Cafe.  I am an incredibly patient person and felt I had given opportunity after opportunity to make it right and they continued to act carelessly and rude beyond words. We got to the restaurant just after 1pm and was greeted by the hostess who said it would be just a few minutes. There was a couple ahead of us so we were the second group to be seated. 10 minutes passed, we were still waiting and so was the couple ahead of us. Then came another party of two and waited behind us. 15 minutes passed and I could see the staff looking into the waiting area and realizing we are all still waiting and not a word was said to us. Over 30 minutes passed and I couldn't handle the awkward looks along with the silence so I went to the woman who later called herself the \"shift lead\" and said we've been waiting for quite a while, like over 30 minutes, what's going on? Her response was \"we have a party in the back\" and I looked around the dining area at all the empty tables and chairs and said \"okay but there isn't a party in here...\" and she rudely continued to say um okay where do you want to sit? At this point I was livid because she made me feel like I was inconveniencing HER. And I said \"if we're an inconvenience I'd be more than happy to take my business elsewhere.\" She didn't seem to care so I walked away and \"Mel\" the server came behind and with attitude called my name and I said well they were here before us (pointing to the couple who had been waiting prior to our arrival)  So Mel sat them and came back for us. She asked to take our drink order and I just couldn't even stomach being in that place any longer so I excused myself and told my mom we were leaving. I told Mel to check her attitude before she helps the next party.   I realize this was long and drawn out but it's been a few hours since this happened and I am still taken aback so incredibly that any company in the world would hire such terrible people. We can all agree that this world is full of unfavorable people but Mimi's Cafe needs to be a little more wise and particular in the type of people they bring on board."}
{"text":"It's a decent chain restaurant. I like that they offer you a muffin with your meal, makes a fat girl smile. When you walk into the restaurant they have a table setup with sample desserts, but being on a diet it made me really sad... I ordered a healthy low calories meal, nothing to talk about.   All in all this place isn't good or bad, it's decent a strong 3 star rating. Not the man of your dreams or a toad, but someone you \"might\"  consider sleeping with."}
{"text":"The wait was long and my soup was cold. The cappuccino was alright. Everything on the \"light\" menu has eggs, so if you don't like eggs and don't want something with 80g of fat and sugar for breakfast, you're kind of screwed."}
{"text":"The cinnamon Brioche French toast breakfast is the best!"}
{"text":"Met others for lunch on a Monday. Not busy, seated quickly. I ordered the sandwich listed as \"Avocado and Tomato\" . If you are going to list Avocado as the first item of the sandwich, I would think there would be more than 2 thin thin slivers of it on the roll. Literally was maybe, just maybe 1/8th of a small avocado on it, I had looked prior to eating it.  Very disappointed, and had I not been with co worker and her mother, I would have sent it back right then. Cream cheese on it, not spread on it, but a huge chunk that was sliced off of a block.  It should have been called \"Cream Cheese Sandwich\" instead, as this item dominated the entire sandwich. This is the second time I have eaten here. The first was a tuna sandwich that was dripping with watery juice, making the bread all soggy. Will not be returning. Do not get what you pay for in my opinion,"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for a late lunch (around 3 PM) and the service was pretty slow considering that there was no one in the waiting area of the restaurant and only a hand full of tables seated. The service was lacking; I asked the waitress to refill my water on multiple occasions but never got a refill. She literally only took my order, brought out the food, and handed us our bill.   Aside from the service, my Cobb Salad was full of flavor. I chose to get the wine vinaigrette, which adds lots of flavor to the salad without over powering it. The dressing is also low in calories which is an added bonus! My boyfriend got the Chicken Tillamook Cheddar Mac. It was a little bit disappointing because the dish was on the dry side. The cheese flavor was as expected as it was Tillamook cheddar! The chicken just needs to not be so overcooked, then the dish would be much better.  Over all, I gave the restaurant extra stars just because I enjoyed my salad so much. I honestly wouldn't come here for anything else."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague!!! Read my other reviews and you will see I am both discerning and quite kind.    The following was sent to their Dallas corporate offices:  Disastrous Experience requiring immediate attention: We chose Mimi's based on positive experiences at your San Antonio location.  Unfortunately, this location is horrible.  1.  We were told it would be a 20-minute wait, but we could see that there were no less than 12 empty tables.  There was a group of three in front of us, and they were told the same thing.  One booth sat there un-bussed and cluttered for 15 minutes.  We were seated at the 21-minute mark.  The section we were led two had 11 empty 4-tops by itself; the other side of the restaurant was about 50% occupied.  2.  Since we had so much time in the lobby, we perused the menu and already decided what we would order.  It took the server about 5 minutes to arrive, and she took our order for soft drinks and our meals.  The drinks arrived 10 minutes later, in styrofoam cups.  The server apologized, stating they were out of glasses; your restaurant was not even 50% occupied at this point.  The majority of the staff were performing their duties in a laconic fashion (and that is being kind).  3.  Our order arrived after an additional 33 minute wait, but  2 of the 3 orders were incorrect.  The Hickory Bacon Cheddar burger arrived with red onions, not \"buttermilk onion strings\" as advertised.  My Chop Chicken Salad arrived initially as a Chicken Caesar.  The staff correctly delivered the Chop Chicken Salad 6 minutes later. - - The couple sitting next to us struck up a conversation; apparently their order took \"forever\" to arrive and was also incorrect.  Another group of 3 at a table chimed in that the staff, \"barely got anything right, but they had waited so long, they just accepted the mistake.\" - - In addition, a couple with a young child on the other side of the restaurant lamented that they had been waiting for their order to arrive for over 90 minutes.    4. When our food did arrive, it's noteworthy to add that the server said, \"oh, I also need to go get you some silverware too.\"  In addition, the bread was brought only after the food, and silverware.  5.  Food Quality:  My Chop Chicken Salad, ordered as an entree, had (at best) 2 ounces of chicken.  I cook routinely, am quite skilled, and measure everything, so trust me, I know.  My wife's West Coast Reuben (half) was pitifully underwhelming, with one small piece of ham, an even smaller piece of turkey, and an a small amount of cabbage.  It was sad, and we took photos. - - As my son finished his Sprite, we also found a gratuitous amount of black particulate matter floating in the bottom of the drink.  None of us consumed any more beverage and we took photos of that as well. - - The hardboiled egg pieces in my wife's spinach salad were an odd shade of gray and were brushed aside; in addition, there was some form of unrecognizable cheese added to the salad, which tasted extraordinarily \"off\".  6.  Hygienic Restaurant practices:  While we waited, we observed at least 3 members of the kitchen staff assembling burgers & sandwiches, plating fries and organizing salad ingredients with their bare hands.  I would have accepted bare hands using tools, but this was bare hands picking up food, layering & situating ingredients.  That is just nasty.  7.  As we were leaving, we noticed that there were 6 tables, completely cluttered with dishes, food, etc that remained un-bussed--at this point, the restaurant was down to about 20% occupancy, so the staff was definitely not overwhelmed.  In closing, this visit was a complete disappointment.  I am sorry to see that Mimi's Cafe has fallen to the wayside and become such a trash heap.  We will not return and we will never recommend this location.  I will be forwarding the aforementioned review to Yelp, FourSquare, Zomato, TripAdvisor, the Charlotte Observer and WCCB Charlotte News.  Although displeased with the performance of this location, I shall still take the time to be respectful and bid you a good evening,"}
{"text":"Looking for a pleasant, quaint dining experience with abit of Parisian  ambience? Mimi's is one of Las Vegas' little gems.  The fresh baked muffins and homemade quiche' are my favorites.  I would suggest breakfast or lunch as the best times to visit.  Service seems a tad lack luster in the evening.  We had to ask for refills, to-go boxes etc.,  wait staff (although very polite) never checked on table .  Yet, he fulfilled requests pleasntly.  All in all the prices are reasonable, menu is varied  and I will return."}
{"text":"This place isn't the same. I don't like the new menus either. The whole environment just seems now like a slightly upscale Dennys. Food was ok but there were screaming kids everywhere and the waitresses seemed overwhelmed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Mimis burgers are very good. The great thing about them is if your part of there eclub you get coupons all the time :) They also have very yummy guacamole."}
{"text":"This location is very reliable if you want quick service with hot, fresh food.  I have never been disappointed while eating here for dinner.  The staff always seems eager to please.  My toddler sons love looking at all the items on the walls and the special kids platters they receive when we sit down are a huge hit (they include cheerios, fruits, etc.) - awesome!"}
{"text":"At this point I kind of consider Mimi's an institution.  I've been dining here for well over fifteen years, including a location in California.  You always know that whatever dish you order it will be well prepared, served at the proper temperature and arrive quickly.  I've probably tried just about everything on their menu and have never been disappointed.  Plus it seems like they are always putting out great coupons.  We manage to make it here about once per month, sometimes for breakfast, but usually for dinner.  The atmosphere and service are top-notch along with great prices make this a continuing favorite."}
{"text":"Won't recommend this place. Servers is horrible! After being seating no one comes to you for over 20 minutes, then appetizer and the meal comes together. Brought out dessert fast but with no spoons waited for 20 minutes nothing until we had to go ask another waiter. Horrible horrible horrible."}
{"text":"I was there today Saturday at 9 AM.  It's 6 miles North west from my house but got there super fast off the 215 on a Saturday morning. The place was busy but my friends already had a table and waiting.  I had the waffles breakfast and took home a blueberry muffin.  Waffles plate w/scrambled eggs & bacon.  Normal decent prices.  \"ALL\" the staff was \"SUPER\" friendly.  I like that in this mean, cold, world.  Ha! Definitely coming back.  It's in the Kohl's shopping center.  Nice busy area."}
{"text":"I am at mimi's every week, and the food is pretty good for breakfast. Get the chibatta breakfast sandwich, or pancakes. You can never go wrong with pancakes."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant makes me feel like I'm in a European small town eating dinner. Very unique food items are very good, affordable  and made the old fashion way. My new favorite place to eat,  I had the French Onion soup for starters. Perfection, not too salty which is great in my book!  Then I had the Hibachi Salmon with mixed vegetables, Broccoli, carrots, green beans, mushrooms and white rice. Yum. For dessert we tried the pumpkin muffin Sunday which was a hit because they heated it, put a big dollop of ice cream on it with a big mound of whipping cream on the side.  Class Restaurant at a good price!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, wasnt very busy but food took quite a long time to come out. Food was not very good, this is a good breakfast place only!!"}
{"text":"Today i tried Mimi's Cafe. There was a 20 minute wait upon arrival even though there were plenty of empty tables. My date thought maybe it had to do with low staff. It went by quickly enough that i didn't get mad lol . I had the French toast with potatoes and egg. It was okay. Definitely edible but nothing to rave over. My date decided to skip breakfast and do meatloaf instead. He loved it. the spinach was fresh and the mashed potatoes were smooth. Our waiter Bobby was attentive and very helpful. His energy was great. Make sure you try the small muffins that are given with the bread basket they are yummy. I had some to go lol."}
{"text":"We started our dinner with the spinach dip. Why do they insist on giving tortilla chips with spinach dip. They don't taste good together. We are at a French restaurant, why don't they give you small breadsticks to dip in the dip? What they have now tells the customer they are making my dining experience as cheap as possible for THEM.   That would explain why everyone's favorite bread with the raisins is now a disappointing shell shape. It is now crisp around the edges. You took away one of my favorite memories of Mimi's.  The Atlantic salmon was delicious. The salmon was a bit small for $14 but it was cooked well. The star of the plate were the small red potatoes. They were well seasoned and tender. The spinach was cooked perfectly and cleaned well. It was yummy.   Don't know that I will be back without another coupon, but I will be grateful it was spinach with the salmon and not broccoli."}
{"text":"Whenever I have visitors to Hendeson, I ALWAYS take them to Mimi's.  In the last MANY years, no one has ever been disappointed with a meal.  The servers are the best in town, so helpful and always so courteous and patient in describing the dishes. I LOVE Mimi's!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Starting with their own twists for a breakfast drink, I tried the Sunrise Pomosa, and loved it.  I'm a sucker for a good Mimosa, but could not pass up this interesting drink that added cranberry juice to the mix. For my meal, I had the Quatre Fromages Quiche.  For my personal tastes, it was a little rich, but if I had not gotten full, I would have finished it all.  The Quiche is served with \"red skin potatoes\" that were a great thing in my mind as I had been missing the \"home fries\" that get served at all the great breakfast places in New England.  I might just have to go there and order just the red skin potatoes on occasion on their own. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The low calorie breakfasts sure taste good! But I dont know if I like the calorie count being displayed or not, because when I order from another section of the menu, I feel guilty =)  Still love their muffins and their breakfast items. The soup and sandwich lunch combos are always tasty and their iced coffee comes in cool looking tall glasses. Kids meals are reasonable and I like that they have side options like fruit, instead of just french fries.  Definitely want to try Mimi's for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"When Mimi's was bought by the French company LeDuff America, Inc. (\"LDA\") a US based subsidiary of Groupe LeDuff SA, headquartered in Rennes, France over eighteen months ago, I thought wow, finally they'll fix this place up. D'oh  If you don't know Le Duff America, their brands in North America and France include Brioche Doree, Café Del Arté, La Madeleine Country French Café, Bruegger's Bagels, Timothy's Coffee and Michel's Baguette.  We fondly remember La Madeleine from living in other parts of the US and had such high hopes for our dinner here last evening  So... what Yelp rating would you give a french themed restaurant that forgets to add the bacon and cheese to their Quiche Lorraine?    That's right. No Gruyère, or even Swiss cheese.  Just a fluffy egg mixture in a crust shell (see photo). I could go on and discuss the absent-minded, exceptionally slow service or a variety of other issues.   Let just say I do not enjoy writing One Star reviews, and leave it at that.    They do deserve at least one star for their delicious muffins.  Otherwise, it would be a zero. Sorry!"}
{"text":"just had dinner with my niece... had the 3-course special --salad, asiago chicken over spaghettini and fresh apple cobbler for dessert. food was very good, price was right,  waitress was nice (jessica),  and good ambience  for chatting and catching up."}
{"text":"Today me and my 18mo daughter had breakfast at Mimi's. It was our first time. The food was good but the service was horrible. It started with the front host that forget to bring the high chair. The waitress gotta out ordem and forgot to bring my coffee and my daughter orange juice, it only came to table after the food and after two request. It was unpleasant. A beautiful restaurant with good food but a lazy service."}
{"text":"My Mother's Day experience with my sons at Mimi's was awesome! A very short wait, excellent service, yummy food and a very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent taste, temperature, service, and cleanliness.    Early morning 7am arrived.    Ann was an excellent server.  Coffee, water spot on (and I like coffee).   The chef altered my order as requested.    The manager showed care for my table.    ......just be a little patient about seating.   They are multi tasking.    Thank You! You made my mad Monday off to a wonderful start!"}
{"text":"We just left and I have to say it was awful. There is a picture of baked Chicken on the menu that looks beautiful. Well, that is not what you get. They put a dollop of butter with a very few herbs in it and it melts and runs off the chicken onto the plate. Small potatoes are awful. Small salad for $2.95 extra. The waitress had 4 tables and just couldn't handle them. Too many good restaurants in Scottsdale. Sorry to say this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Traveling with kids and a group of parents that You just know is difficult when you have to choose a place GOOD to everybody. Let me tell you Mimmi's Cafe is the place. I have a delicious meal: Tomatoes basil soup, salmon salad and a Glass of wine of the house. Boys have Fried Crunchy Chicken and Waffles and others hamburgers or chicken platters. Everybody was happy for less than 45 per family, tip included."}
{"text":"Today was not a good day at Mimi's. the French fried potatoes were hard.  the second batch of fries were hard.  the home fries were so greasy. The 1st cup of coffee was not good till they brewed the new batch, and that coffee was good. The waitress was annoyed because I asked her to give me a plate to replace the dirty plate she gave me.  The first time I came was good and I look forward to coming back, after today I have no desire to come back."}
{"text":"Service was great food is very good very friendly Love the atmosphere stuff is very neat I recommend this as a breakfast joint"}
{"text":"I got sick after eating a sandwich here. My first visit as well. I really wanted to like this place but it's hard after this experience. May be one day I will feel differently after some time passes."}
{"text":"This place has really turned around, a long time ago they were not so great. Apparently they made some awesome changes to staff a while ago so now this has become one of my favorite brunch places to go with my son.  Food is good, staff is awesome, our favorite waiter is Sy.  Gotta go check them out..."}
{"text":"I went here with my girl friend for breakfast about two days ago. The hostess girls at the front were completely rude sat us right by the door so we could hear everyone in the waiting room and feel the breeze every time someone came in or left, so annoying. After the girl gave us a hard time about moving us to a different table we got stuck with a mute server. She was so quiet we could barely understand her and the fact that we probably saw her about 3 times during our entire visit so refills were not done no extra napkins or anything of that matter. She was sure quick to come by with the check. The breakfast portion was small and eggs looked like they had been sitting out in the back for 15 mins. before even brought out to us. Needless to say it was expensive and we got cold crappy food. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I would love to write a long review based on the awesome food and atmosphere that Mimi's use to be, however that is not the case anymore.   Out server seemed to be very confused and slow but that is not the reason for this review. As we are waiting on our food I look over at the table next to us and a lovely little cockroach began crawling around, our server walked over grabbed it with a napkin and went on his way like nothing happened. Before I got a chance to tell my server I would like to leave they brought out our food, I then told them I was sorry but I wouldn't be eating cause what I saw. The manager came out apologized and said our meal was taken care of, I was told they just sprayed the previous day that's why the roaches are out. As we were picking up our things to leave I see they handed the table that had the roach on it a check, I walked over to the server and questioned why they had to pay their bill when the roach was on their table and we didn't have to pay one. He then tried to justify that they had eaten their food already. I walked out pretty pissed and I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Every weekend I go out to breakfast with my father and we try a new place.  This week was Mimi's.    1- Entered the door. Everyone seemed happy and polite.  Was told there would be a 10 minute wait for a table for two.  Glanced around the rooms and saw 7 open tables of various sizes.  (and just for a note, the two larger tables for 6-8 were never sat for about the hour we were here)  2- Ordered the pink lemonade. There is some sort of artificial sweetener in this, even when they say there is not, you can taste it.  Unfortunately, the migraine I got from it afterwards would also say there is sucrolose in it.  3- Ordered the corn beef hash meal and the apple and bacon waffles. My father wasn't impressed with the hash, but said it was okay.  He stated the rye toast was the best part of his meal.  My waffles were SMOTHERED in syrup and had been sitting before being brought to the table so they were soggy.  The apple pieces were raw and turning brown.  Fairly expensive for three TINY soggy waffles with small apple pieces and crumbles of bacon on it, nothing special, expensive, and a little gross.  I always request my eggs like this \"two, hard fried. very hard fried. burn them if needed. i would like them very dry and crunchy.\"  when the food was brought to the table by a runner, the waitress came by before we could even take a bite to ask how it was. then she disappeared for about 25 minutes when we had to flag someone down for the check.  When I finally got to cut into my eggs? RUNNY.   4- Slow service.  Lots of staff, but can never seem to get anyone's attention.  And (this really is no ones fault) to top off such a terrible morning, the waitress's pen exploded all over my hands when I tried to sign the check."}
{"text":"My grandparents love this place!!  I am originally from Minnesota and we had a place called Perkins. This feels like Perkins ran away with a French man and had a baby. The food is standard to what you would see at an average American restaurant but with a French flair. I've had a few different things since it's one of my grandparents favorite places to eat. The pot pie is massive so be sure you go hungry. It's good but you really need to be ready for a large meal. They have decent sandwiches but nothing I've had has really blown me away yet. I really enjoy it because my grandparents enjoy it. If you need somewhere to take your parents or grandparents this is the spot!!"}
{"text":"Ughh. No. Food is just bad. My folks used to like it quite a bit, frequently dining with friends but hadn't been in a while; they were served atrocious meals Monday. The only thing Dad liked was the Diabeetus-in-a-loaf carrot raisin bread (and he used to love their chicken pot pie--this one was cold and the gravy tasted like uncooked flour) Mom's meatloaf was abysmally dry and over oniony; three times the server asked if she'd like a to-go box for her nearly untouched meal without connecting the dots?! They are super easy to please, so complaints are few and far between. I'd not been in years...and  Then, last night, friends brought me take out: the pictured salmon was cooked to an inedible dryness and fishy to the point that I questioned its freshness. Spinach, which I'll usually eat in any form/preparation was watery and like a salt lick; potatoes were a mushy starchy mess.   Admittedly I've never been a fan, but joined family and friends on several occasions. Though with many dining options light years better nearby, I've always made other \"suggestions.\"   One * for getting inedible food into take away box and one * because none of us died and I don't believe the awful was because of gross negligence, the kitchen seems clueless. Suggestion to procure fresh food and prepare it correctly.   Will not go back willingly.  Ordinarily I feel bad about leaving a critical review, but this was unsalvageable, twice in one week :-("}
{"text":"I love coming here on the weekend for breakfast! The mimosa's are DELISH! And the fresh muffins are good too. This location is always busy and there is always a wait but they are able to seat you relatively fast which is always appreciated. This is my new go to spot for breakfast:-)"}
{"text":"In the past six months I have seen a steady downfall in the preparation of the dishes and service at Mimi's. ( Stephanie St. location). I ordered the salmon dinner and it was dried out. There were few vegetables on the plate. There was a small amount of spinach and four, yes,  four small roasted potatoes. Another time, I ordered the egg breakfast. The bacon was stringy and in parts inedible. Recently, I again ordered the breakfast (2 scrambled eggs, bacon,roasted potatoes, English muffin and coffee) The restaurant was not crowded yet the wait was a long one. When the food finally arrived, the eggs were lukewarm, the bacon was stringy , again!, and the potatoes were, well, one was completely frozen, and the others were cold! The server neglected to ask me if everything was ok until she arrived to hand us our bill.I told her about the potatoes and she willingly gave me a small fruit cup in its place. Oh good, their fruit cup is usually good. The fruit in the past at Mimi's was clean, firm and tasty. Again, disappointment. The grapes were mushy, and the cantaloupe was not sweet. The pineapple was also tasteless.  Big changes at this Mimi's and not for the better."}
{"text":"\"Of all the restaurants in this town, I had to walk into this one...\" and unfortunately made the same mistake again a few more times.  I can attest that I'm not a glutton for punishment, but I really wanted this place to live up to it's atmosphere, and there's great potential there.  I would also like to add, in my defense, that it was just across the street- Which should've made for a quick lunch.  As soon as you step inside the dimly lit entry, you get the connection to New Orleans and the French Quarter by the infinite amount of items plastered around the walls.  They will come in handy when you're trying to pass the \"infinite\" amount of time it takes to get your order taken.  Of the four times I've walked through their doors, our table left once because of a 20 minute wait with no service, and complimentary desserts were served another time because of 45 minutes with no food.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me four times, shame-shame on me.  If you're dragged to this place, get the chicken pot pie.  Everything else is mostly non-eventful or tastes like a highly-priced Bob Evans dish."}
{"text":"It's fine.  I've been here twice in the last week for breakfast because it was convenient.  Had the oatmeal both times.  It was good.  The second time I was brought out granola bits instead of raisins and didn't care for that so had to ask for the raisins.  Iced tea is good and they are nice enough to give you a cup to go.    Biggest complaint over the two visits was on the second one a family with three young children was sat directly across from us even though the entire restaurant was almost empty.  Made conversation harder and the kids were fussy.  Why would the hostess do that?!?!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly but had to wait too long for drinks and bread basket. After ordering it took a long time to get food and there were only three of us! I think the cafe in Phoenix is much much better and is very busy. The one in Vegas must be going broke. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here and it was like Denny's meets fine dining.   This isn't an \"eaters\" paradise, small pricey portions and in my opinion the food was just ok.  This will never be a place of choice for me!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Service and Good Food I was visiting a friend in Las Vegas and ate at this place twice while we were there. The first time the waitstaff went above and beyond to make sure I was happy and the management even gave me two free muffins after I told them how much I loved their Blueberry Carmel muffins. Waitress was pleasent and we all loved the food.  The second time everything was good also and the food was good. Will be back to this place next time I visit my friend in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Again, Serge, was an angel sent from heaven.  My Mom and I eat regularly.  He greeted us with diet cokes and water without taking our order and brought us bread right after that.  Talk about customer service and excellence!  We then ordered and he remembered our usual orders.  Not only is the food delicious but the experience here is out of this world, we always feel like queens coming to this location.  Thank you Serge!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this review is not a reflection of my lunch experience today, but the return trip afterwards.   Grabbed lunch with my husband today...  Walked in and we were immediately greeted by the host,  Broady... We've been here before nothing spectacular but we were going for soup & salad Both our soups tasted great!  Our server Gina was friendly and very attentive..   After we left, about an hour later I realized I had left my phone on the table.  When I returned it was after the lunch hour and apparently the shift change.  I walked in, no host or hostess, and one guy behind the bar area with his back to the door. I walked up and mentioned that I had left my phone on a table in the back, and Gina served us. He then picked up the phone and called someone to ask about a phone being turned in.. After about 5 minutes another person came out and asked if I had been helped, I said sort of, because they knew why I was there but  no one came out.   At that time a sales guy had come in and asked to speak to the manager. That is when Megan appearred. It was then that the bar keeper asked her about the phone, and her reply was \"You didn't tell me what it looked like.\" I interjected and said its an Iphone, that was lost within the hour. Her snapped back response was no one told me what it looked like..\"  (No one asked) I didn't realize there would be a flurry of phones being left within the hour.   The guy who I originally questioned now walked to the back to look for himself, and low and behold came back with my phone."}
{"text":"I came in this past Sunday at any typical restaurant \"brunch rush\" so my boyfriend and I waited about 30-35 minutes to get a table, which really wasn't a huge problem since we were sitting at a table outside in the shade with a nice breeze. But I mainly want to rant about my food.... I got the 4 stack pancakes with eggs and turkey sausage, which the pancakes by far have been the BEST pancakes I've ever eaten, they were so fluffy and flavorful!!!! I need to go back ASAP"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here, my husband and I were able to have a lunch date. Our waiter, Javier, told us to bring our kids for breakfast sometime. The food was yummy, the service was great, and the atmosphere was delightful. So we returned today for breakfast at the peak of the brunch rush. They were packed, but we were in there in 25 minutes (despite being quoted a 35-minute wait time). Once we were seated, the waiter greeted us almost immediately, and we had our food 10 to 15 minutes after ordering. Our kids even loved it, and they are not easy to please. I had the lemon poppyseed griddlecakes. One of my children ordered tacos (farmhouse?). My youngest ordered chocolate chip pancakes and fruit, which he scarfed down, and my husband raved about the andouille sausage omelette. YUM! An added bonus: We met \"Grandma Jean.\" If you miss your own mom or grandma, ask for her. She is adorable and extremely friendly! :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this chain of a place when I lived in this neck of PHX.. that was then.. and this is now.. I have fallen out of love with you Mimis.. You simply let me down.. In need of a little soup on my day over in the Tukee.. I decided out of everything close to my Dr. that day.. I could go to Mimi's ...reliable, comfort food.. Well, rude and lack of customer service met us at the door.. My friend had a salad.. she tried to send it back.. it was soggy.. and the chicken was 'weird tasting', she said.. She is newly pregnant.. so it was enough to just ruin her meal.. We waited and waited.. waited and waited.. I finally flailed my arms about to get A WAITERS attention.. itd been that long! He did apologize.. he offered her something new.. but we had an appointment.. (yeah.. since you waited 20 min to return to our table yet asked all the tables around us how they were liking their meals!).. and we needed to go.. I will say my soup was good.. not worth 3 or higher good.. but okay.. how about 2 for okay.. and 0 for all else.. Im not sure Mimi is my girl anymore:-=("}
{"text":"We had a 2 for one coupon and we had brunch. Great service and food  French toast with cream cheese and orange marbelade stuff. Oh so good !"}
{"text":"Well, were to begin.  Shambray was an excellent server.  I had the corned beef hash Benedict.  The egg was way over and it didn't have an English muffin with it.  I asked and they said it does not come with an English muffin in it.  Really???  Side of bacon was good.  Potatoes were boring.  Coffee was average.  I've heard good things but I will not be back.  So many better places that pay attention to quality control and don't hit you for over $40 for two for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is about the only chain restaurant in Summerlin that my parents and I will agree on the quality. It's pretty good, especially for breakfast/brunch.   Now, some may say this place is pricey compared to what's nearby, which it kind of is? Except that the breakfasts here still come with juice and muffins, whereas you have to add that stuff at a lot of other places. The juice glass is small, but the muffins are heated up for you and of a good size and quality. And the food is pretty solid. They do serve alcohol here, though I've never gone in so I can't rate the bar service.  Now, I wanted to give this four stars because I genuinely like going here, but the drawback to this place is that the service SUCKS. Seriously, I don't know if it's just because this place is constantly busy (though that's no excuse) or what, but every single waitperson I've ever had here has been diner-quality waitstaff and not sit-down chain quality waitstaff. It's very jarring."}
{"text":"Waitress (jen) was nice but we waited very long for the food. Food also not too tasty. Ordered the chicken crepes and were cold when they came out."}
{"text":"We stopped into Mimi's Cafe yesterday evening for dinner. It was our first time dining with Mimi's. We were promptly seated and waited on by a nice gentleman. I ordered the \"Fit Fare Mahi-mahi\" and my husband ordered the \"Fit Fare Salmon\". Before our order came up our waiter brought out some fresh bread. The carrot/raisin nut bread was amazing. It was almost like having dessert before dinner. Our entrees came out shortly and were well presented. My Mahi was on a bed of spinach and brown rice with a tomato basil sauce. The meal was excellent and I ate up every bite. My hubby enjoyed his meal, as well, and loved the tomato basil sauce my entree came with. After our meal, our server brought over some complimentary muffins (one low-fat blueberry muffin and carrot/raisin muffin) since it was our first time dining there. Mimi's exceeded my expectations and I look forward to going back again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I discovered Mimi's Cafe a couple months ago, and have come back pretty much once every two weeks. I have found the best time to come is when they email you the free dinner/lunch coupon. I've tried almost all the dishes at Mimi's and have found that they all taste pretty good. My favourite dish here is the crispy chicken on spaghetti with artichokes. The portion is big, tastes great, and is pretty cheap. The chicken is always really crispy and the sauce tastes great. A real alternative to Cheesecake factory! The bread basket is also very good...I love the poppy seed bread and the walnut bread---I always ask for seconds! I'm not really a fan of the corn chowder here...its waaaaay too thick and starchy, and with too little corn. The chicken piccata has a somewhat artificial lemon taste in the sauce. For chicken piccata, better try Cheesecake Factory's. I'm glad I've discovered Mimi's Cafe!"}
{"text":"I had the egg Benedict *** Good*** The service was Okay!!! Not too busy.... Easy find at New Years Day 2015."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I have been eating breakfast here for quite a few years and am always taken care of! I always sit with Leah or cris and they are great waitress thanks for your great service"}
{"text":"Came for a brunch seminar  Was given free bread as a starter and it was cold Had to ask for straws for my water  Ordered Cobb salad dressing on the side And ordered the pot roast  Drinks Straight lemonade  Coffee"}
{"text":"Manager refused to take my certificate for a free specialty coffee and a free desert that Mimi's issued to recognize and thank school staff for their educational efforts in the community. I was not happy that they refused my reward I received so I left."}
{"text":"I really love this place, the inside makes you feel right at home. The food is always excellent. They're artichoke dip is sooo good! And they're bread baskets are awesome!"}
{"text":"I use to love going to Mimi's on weekends for breakfast.  Maybe I should have stuck with that.  Went there on my lunch break around 115pm and was suprised that it wasnt entirely busy so I figured we would be in and out...I was wrong!  The waitress was a little slower than normal, may have been new.  I had the french onion soup and the asian salad.  The soup was good but the salad had little taste and the chicken looked like the chicken I sometimes purchase from Costco!  Not an overall bad experience...will have to go back for breakfast to see if it gets any better!"}
{"text":"Very happy great service and not crowded at all. Really quite for a Friday night . They got 5 dollar vino and the hats per glass Our server Kyle was super nice and attentive Good menu selection. The restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"I went there today for first time and I totally love it! I got the Royale Turkey sandwich which it was very good, the corn chowder was amazing and the cream brûlée was out of this world. Ernesto the server was very fast and and helpful even he was busy with other tables. I highly recommend this location if you want homemade style food and good service."}
{"text":"French food as French as Olive Garden is Italian. You'd think they would at least try to fake us into thinking they were French. But the prices? Oh yes, they are French. And the portions are French too. Neither of those are meant to be complimentary.  I have only eaten at Mimi's twice, both times for office Christmas parties, so I have never seen the full menu. This year I ordered the turkey cobb salad, and it was quite tasty. If it is at all possible, there was too much bacon for my liking. I ordered the bacon vinaigrette dressing, so maybe it was bacon overload.   I can attest to the skill of the staff, but occasions went smoothly, with only minimal errors with our orders. The bathroom was clean, they have some pretty interesting sink faucets.   If prices were 40% less, I'd be a fan, and since the quality of the food was great, I'd have no trouble awarding 4 stars."}
{"text":"I always want to be pleased if not delighted!   I have been to this particular Mimi's in N. Las Vegas three times......believed before I had caught them on a bad day. So in all fairness this review is accumulated over three separate visits, the last being the very worst. Being there with family, all were in a great mood and they had chosen the place. Waitress introduced herself and we seemed headed for a great breakfast. We chatted and waited and waited and waited....finally the waitress brought some of the food and explained to one party they had burned her breakfast crepes and would remake for her. My eggs benedict were ordered eggs poached medium well with no running whites. If they had been somewhere close I could have been stoic but being so runny and somewhat clear looking, there was no way. They said they would happily redo and brought me back two eggs in the identical runny white condition. I gave up. The redone crepes appeared finally and the whole plate was very beige and apparently tasted beige also!   I chased down the waitress for more coffee....chasing meaning actually having to leave my seat to locate her.... chased her to give her my coupon......then I chased her down for the bill, then I had to chase her down to pay the bill.  During the course of our meal, we watched a couple seated near us leave after receiving no attention from any waitress at all.   The interior of this Mimi's looks dated, dark and yes, I am comparing this one to my favorite Reno Mimi's but it should be able to stand up to any comparison. We shall not be back."}
{"text":"After 12 hours of hard labor in the Arizona heat, all I (and my boss) wanted to do was eat and sleep. It was 10pm and EVERYTHING was closed. After Chili's didn't give in to our begging and pleading to feed us, we stumbled across Mimi's Cafe.   The place looked like a Mexican restaurant, but I was too hungry and tired to care. It's actually American diner food (obviously right? tired + hungry = my excuse). Our ancient, but friendly waitress served us some French bread and oh-so tasty sweet bread. I had what the waitress recommended, pot roast, while my boss ordered a 12 ounce steak. The portions are HUGE for the price.   Overall a good experience and would highly recommend it if you're in the area. Why go to Chili's/Applebee's/Ruby Tuesdays when you can get better service, food, and giant portions for the same price? Oh, and their open late too."}
{"text":"My wife, son, and I recently visited this MiMi's for the first time.  We've had bad service experiences at locations in Austin, TX and OKC, but love the food and wanted to give this location a try hoping for a better experience.  Unfortunately, it ended up being the same:  Great food, bad service.  Waited at least 10 minutes after being seated before waitress came to our table.  Then at least 10 or 15 minutes between each visit to the table.  Maybe understandable on a very busy day, but the place was pretty quiet and not even half full.  Maybe one day I'll visit one with both good food and good service.  Interesting how each has been the same, even at various spots across the country."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to dinner a few  nights ago. We had the sweetest waitress. She was soft spoken but knew how to be a great suggestive seller. She asked us if we would like to try certain items on the menu and if we would like to try their soup of the day... Broccoli and cheese.. mmmmm the husband so loved it he said it was the best. I have the Tomato Basil which I love... This experience was great, as it always is. I frequently find myself, in my chef uniform, coming here to have a great cup of coffee, toast and just a nice few minutes to relax before i start my day.  Thank you for the great experience time after time."}
{"text":"Love the French dip sandwich and the Asian chicken salad. Yum. Service was good. We will come back."}
{"text":"It is too bad that I have to give this a 1 because there are some good personnel, and often good food. But this morning was the last chance. This story starts before Christmas... I had ordered a \"holiday feast\" to be picked up at 4:30 on the 24th. Between ordering and picking up, I had surgery and it was harder on my body than anticipated. I had a ride and was able to be out and about earlier than expected on the morning of the 24th, and I did not know if my post surgery stamina would last until 4:30. I called to this Mimi's to see if there was any way I could pick it up early (around 11). I was put on hold and no one returned. Since I was right around the corner, I asked my husband to drive me there and I would just go inside. I continued to wait on the phone as I walked inside. What I experienced next was shameful. As I waited at the To Go area, I listened as 2 waitstaff (females) and 1 manager talked very rudely and disrespectfully about the person on the phone asking to pick up the order early. The manager looked at the phone, waved his hand and walked away. I got his attention, told him that I had been waiting on the phone and why I asked to pick up early, but told him I didn't want it now and walked away. As I was leaving I decided I wanted pictures to document the rude personnel and went back inside. As I was taking pictures (the rude manager said \"oh s**t\" and quickly turned away when I snapped his pic), anther manager Brett came out to try and fix things. He got us our meal and we left. The meal was good for a reheated meal the next day, maybe just a little too salty. I called the corporate number to let them know what had happened, and they referred the incident back to the store. A couple of days later the manager that helped, Brett, called me. He was very polite, and offered to have me come in again with the meal \"on him\", and said he would send an email to confirm. I never received the email, but it could have been misspelled. He also told me to call when I wanted to come in to confirm he was working. Well, I called this morning. The girl that answered said he would be in later and asked who was calling. I said \"that's ok I will try him again later, thank you\" (he told me not to leave my name if not comfortable), and without any other word she just hung up on me. That was the last chance. Brett- time for a change up there. Try to hire some people that either want to do their jobs, or can at least fake a little respect or kindness."}
{"text":"My family has been to Mimi's on several occasions. Today, a Sunday afternoon, we anticipated a long wait.  We waited approximately 45 minutes for a table (our choice to wait) the wait for food was also a bit long but again to be expected. What upsets me about this particular visit is that we put our name on the list right at 11 am we just walked out the doors (my husband is still inside waiting for our waitress to return so he can pay) it is now nearly 1:30pm.   The food is always good and normally I would rate this restaurant at 4.5 stars. Maybe today was an off day?  If our waitress could have stayed on task a bit better we could have been in and out. She seemed to slack once the crowds died down even though there were still customers like myself that weren't being tended too"}
{"text":"This place needs some new management. Tables sat open and unbussed for twenty minutes while patrons at the front were told there would be a twenty minute wait before they could be seated. It took our server so long to greet us that she asked us if we were ready to order food at the same time she asked us about drinks.   The food is generally okay. It's no corner bistro in Paris."}
{"text":"Service was 5 stars!!! My bacon was over done and my server noticed it and brought me fresh bacon.   Food was ok....standard breakfast. I would come back because the service was amazing.....now in days it's hard to find that 5 star service."}
{"text":"Visited this Mimi's last night after giving it a rest following two terrible experiences when our regular server (Sherrie) as not working.  Luckily, she was our server last night and even through she was obviously busy, she provided us her usual outstanding service.  We ordered our regular Chicken Parmesan and it was hot (not always the case) and it was delicious.  We will return but only when she is scheduled."}
{"text":".Nice atmosphere, friendly service, with a wide variety of food on their menu. Mimi's Cafe is always a nice place to go for any occasion"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly service, with a wide variety of food on their menu. Mimi's Cafe is always a nice place to go for any occasion."}
{"text":"Had lunch and ordered a burger. The burger was cooked to order, but it was so greasy! The fries came out barely warm and very soggy. They should remove both of these items from their menu."}
{"text":"This location did nothing to help our Christmas dinner. After ordering a holiday meal online this previous Friday, my mother in law was looking forward to picking up her order for Christmas Eve. When at the store, she was told that they didn't have her food order and after waitng 30 minutes, they wouldn't be able to get her any food for another 45 minutes to an hour. We already had guests at home waiting for food so we did not choose to wait. I understand this is a holiday and a busy time for restaurants, but this was simply unprofessional especially to someone in the restaurant industry. We will not be ordering from Mimi's again unfortunately."}
{"text":"The question comes up again - what happened to the old Mimi's?  The food quality has gone down hill tremendously (tasted canned/old) and the service was not very good (not attentive and \"fake-nice\").  The bathrooms look like they need attention (maintenance and cleaning).  No thanks."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the Glendale Az location! We were there a little while... and asked if we could sit at the bar..when it opens up/the  Hostess said sure!Soon after.. We sat down/Mayra was our waitress ...we really like getting her/always hoping we do! She is highly efficient/great/her attitude is great !  She was extremely busy/did not let it bother her! She kept us happy!!!  :)  :) :)"}
{"text":"Well..  They did say they were sending a few gift cards out for my mother but we never received any."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Mimi's in california 2002. It was not nice and I never returned until a year ago in Vegas and it was pleasant. Yesterday I visited the stephanie location and was prompted to do this review. We had maybe a 5 minute wait which gave us time to review the menu that was on a table waiting to be read. We were seated, ordered our drinks and food and were eating in less than ten minutes. Both orders came out together and hot. The place was not slammed but they were busy and did not lag at all. Our waiter Marcus was right on top of everything and made it enjoyable. I had the Santa fe omelette and it was so fresh and good, along with the blueberry muffin. Yep, I Will surely return!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were seated at 11:30.   The waitress, Loise, immediately told us her five grandchildren and kids were eating in our section and that she would be attending to them but let her know when we were ready order.   We tried many times to get her attention and it was 12:15 before she finally took our order.  After that, it was another 20 minutes before we received our food.  When I said we had been there over an hour without food she said that we didn't order right away.   The only reason we didn't was that we couldn't get her attention.  Bad dining experience, will not go back."}
{"text":"After donating blood for Red Cross, I was craving for Eggs Benedict.  The creamy, smooth, silky hollandaise sauce over my eggs and English muffins...MMMMM, so I went to Mimi's Café at 75th and Bell because I know they can't mess up the hollandaise sauce since its Franchise. WRONG, the hollandaise was lumpy and very thick.  I told the waitress to take it back and make a new one because the cook over cook a sauce. About a minute later, the waitress came back with the manager saying the whole batch it's like this, seriously? I was puzzle.  Then the waitress told me just try it first.  I'm sorry I will not put that lumpy thing in my mouth thank you. I was really, really disappoint it. So the manager says, \"Would you like to try something else?\" Anyway, I end up order ham & eggs. Luckily it didn't turn out green. Here's the advice, if the cook can't cook the food, get rid of them.  There are plenty of cook/chef looking for job now and day."}
{"text":"Food had no taste...waitress was not friendly. The food taste like it was previously frozen and just warmed up."}
{"text":"GROSS!   The men's bathroom is enough to kill an appetite. The floors are sticky. Heard of a mop? It was dirty enough for me to leave and not eat here."}
{"text":"This people save us a night while we're looking for a good place to eat.  They close at 10pm and we arrived at 9:58pm (party of 3). We asked for a favor since we're visiting from California and we're not familiar with the area to keep looking were to eat. They let us have a dinner there, a so good dinner!    Unfortunately I don't have the names but it was a lady who was our server and this is a guy on the kitchen. Both were serving us. I have no words to describe how good was the service and the food.  But the best part is to be served even when they have the kitchen near to be closed.  Thank you so much.   It was on June 18, 2018 at 9:58pm and we stay until 10:40pm"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service sat for over 10 minutes with not even a quarter of the restaurant full but we couldn't even get a water. The least they could have done was had someone say we will be right with you but not even a glance in our direction . They weren't busy 5 people just hanging out it looked like . Manager made eye contact several times but never acknowledged the situation: rude."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my meal today at Mimi's, and that's a first. I ordered what I thought was going to be a light lunch, but when she brought it, 15 minutes after we ordered - a tuna on a croissant with a cup of tomato soup - the sandwich was covered in cheese, a thick piece of melted cheddar cheese. I took the fork and the whole piece of cheese came off in one stroke. I put the heart attack aside and ate from the tuna down, with a fork and knife, as the croissant was harder than I am use to. I was very disappointed. I am hoping this was just one bad experience and the next time I go there it will be better, or did Mimi's lose its quality? I had ordered \"mix and match\" and wanted  1/2 a tuna sandwich and soup - but the waiter said something about it being better if I ordered a full sandwich so I said okay. Apparently, that's where my  1/2 tuna got switched to tuna w/cheddar cheese. I would never order cheese on a tuna sandwich, the whole thing was odd."}
{"text":"I had decided to boycot this place over a year ago and hadn't been there since. Against my better judgement, I allowed myself to be conned in to going back. The French Onion Soup was barely hot, but good. The rest of our meal was merely ok. The service was absolutely crappy...just like back in the day. The food took forecer and the lack of attention to the details is where they are in a consistant state of failure. Goid news...they are rolling out a menu change and getting rid of the top sellers that they reduced the pryion sizes of."}
{"text":"Super expensive for what is was. We got appetizers, the zuchhini strips were okay, but the crab cakes were awful. The service was terrible too. Our server could not focus on us and stared off into the distance... Odd, will not return."}
{"text":"I don't remember this Mimi's ever being so bad in the past. Everything was slow. Half of the food was cold. Overall it was a very bad experience and not worth close to what it cost. I won't be returning and can't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. Corned beef hash Benny is amazing!  Don't forget to try a fresh back blueberry muffin too"}
{"text":"Food breakfast place in Henderson that isn't a chain diner or a casino coffee shop. The staff is friendly. That is all."}
{"text":"Um, I have been to Mimi's before but this visit was not the best. The hubby had bacon with his meal. It was undercooked. We asked for them to cook it a bit longer, the waiter brings it back out in about 15 seconds... she had put it in the microwave. Yuck. We both had a side of homestyle potatoes that were overcooked, slightly burnt. The pumpkin muffin was not the best. It was dry and sort of tasteless. That was disappointing. I prob wont be going back to Mimi's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for my dads birthday and it was a pleasant experience. I ordered the grilled salmon with lentils and ill be completely honest.. the salmon was absolutely delicious, not too dry.. but the lentils I wasn't a fan of. My dad had their pot roast which to him was succulent and tender so it was definitely a great choice. Service was on point. Our waiter was very personable. I loved that their bread was unlimited. Overall it was a pretty good dinner,  I would definitely recommend this place and I know ill be returning."}
{"text":"This is a chain place I had never experienced before.  We went here when visiting relatives in town.  I have driven past one in Concord, CA but never been inside one.  Overall, it is good, especially for a chain, but has that rather mediocre blandness of pretty much any such eatery.   When we first walked in, my wife and I felt like it was a slightly fancy, ersatz-French Applebee's and were a bit taken aback.  We were happier with the meal and service, though.  It basically is, in food and especially decor, kind of  like an ersatz-French/generic \"European\" Applebee's in that generic, stock American impression of what French and general \"European\" or \"Continental\" places would be like, with a basic, generic cookie-cutter feel about it.    However, thankfully the food and service were better.  We were happy with the food, which basically seems to be generic interpretations of American and French food: steak, fries, fried onions, salad, and house red wine, all of which was perfectly fine and enjoyable but not memorable.  Nothing was great but nothing was bad and it made for an enjoyable time for the whole group of us.  The standout thing was the service.  Our waiter was wonderful - very friendly, helpful, eager to serve, attentive, efficient, in short perfect.  The worst thing, in the end, is the rather tacky cheapo decor and feel of the place itself, largely an inherent problem with such chain places.  I should add that the place has different rooms that appear rather vaguely to have different appearances or \"themes,\" none of which works very well: there is what appears to be an \"American\" room, a \"French/Parisian\" room, and a \"Southern French\" room, etc.  Just think of a shizophrenic Applebees' with fake \"international\" theme instead of the fake \"local\" theme."}
{"text":"We used to eat here 3-4 times a month. I joined their club. I get sent weekly coupons, which honestly highly motivated me to go to Mimi's. A simple transaction, I'd show the server the code I was emailed and we'd carry on with our business. Food was always good. Service was usually good. The last visit I was told a manager needed to see the coupon. Ok. Cool. She comes over, says \"coupon?\" writes down the code and walks away. No, hey how are you. Thanks for coming in, being a club member... Nothing. We felt as if this coupon was somehow putting her out, or we were somehow trying to get away with some fiscal indiscretions. This has since motivated us to seek out a new weekly lunch place.  Coupons be damned."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. We were seated quickly and service was fast.  I ordered the breakfast tacos, which were very tasty. My friend ordered the egg white omelette and he said it was also very good.  Server was very attentive and made us feel welcomed. We will return here again."}
{"text":"I took my aunt there for lunch on saturday it wasn't even busy, our waitress Kim was so hyper and not very good, it took the kitchen 45 minutes to get our food out,  all I had was a salad and my aunt had eggs. when I asked for the manager the waitress got very hyper and interrupted me so I demanded to see the manager. When she came over she just wanted to make sure everything was ok, never asked me what is wrong and did not offer to waive the bill, I had to ask her to adjust the bill and I paid for one meal,  she actually should've picked up the whole bill, will never go there terrible service..........."}
{"text":"My favorite items on their menu seem to disappear, but I appreciate how they will still let me order them anyway.  They have to modify the ingredients, but their salmon is always delicious. Service is good and I always enjoy their muffins and bread."}
{"text":"It was just OK. The service was great at least our waitress was. I feel this place has become to big for it's own good. I have eaten at Mimi's in CA back in the late 80-'s early 90's and it was very good. I realize now it was purchased by Bob Evan's in 2004 and I can see now why the quality has gone downhill.  Now it is just ok with greasy food.  I tend to only go for breakfast so I am not versed on lunch or dinner here.  Breakfast is OK. Nothing special but not terrible either."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. I love the spinach salad with salmon. I've had good service each time. It's not a 5 star place because it's good ole home cooking. The crowd is not hip or loud, but they know where the good home cooking style of food can be found."}
{"text":"This place is a good high end brunch place. We went on a Sunday at about 1130, and it was packed with a mostly elderly clientele. The staff were very good to my husband and I, two younger heavily tattooed guys. I think the older clientele were a little worried by us, though.   Our waitress was fantastic, and was super friendly. She only teased us a little for ordering hot drinks on a 90 degree day. She also helped us figure out some of the local area.   The food is in the 10-15 range, but was very good. I'm gad we walked past the Red Robin's to get there.   We also bought four muffins to take back to the hotel with us. That was great for dinner later."}
{"text":"5 Stars with Charles, 1 Star without Charles. To put it simply, if you eat at this restaurant, ASK FOR CHARLES! He is the only waiter there who knows what to do. He's extremely knowledgeable about the menu (he'll suggest certain dishes if you're a first-timer after listening to your likes), very kind, and super fast! He's the only way to have a great experience at this restaurant.  WITHOUT Charles, here is what you can expect. 1) An extremely long wait time after ordering food (they may forget about you, I've witnessed waits up to 1hr for a party of 4). 2) Really, cold, food, that has clearly been sitting under a broken heat lamp. 3) A waitress or waiter who will disappear and never refill your drinks. 4) Items (normally fruit) that come with your order NEVER arrive with the \"cold plate\", which is a bit ironic because they are supposed to be cold. 5) At least one order made incorrectly (in a group of 3 from my experiences). 6) Stained dishes and glasses.  Management at this restaurant is also very poor. Obviously, due to the ratings they currently have. If this happens to reach management, here's a tip, have Charles train all of the other servers in the restaurant! Yes, promote him! He's that good! He even remember the names of the couple sitting beside us. And on my way out, thanked both me and my fiancée for choosing Mimi's. Need I say more? To the owners, he is definitely management material! At least on the customer service end of things.  Bottom line: with Charles, this place may be the best brunch spot in Charlotte! I'm talking 5 star rating! Without him, it's 1 star on a good day!  About me, I've been to the spot 5 times. I've only had 2 great experiences. And guess what my waiter's name was on those 2 occasions...  I hope this helps!  Good luck!  ***The 3 star was given due to my overall experiences. I included all 5 visits***"}
{"text":"This is a great place for excellent home cooked food! Love it. They actually make alot of the food there. The manager Brett is very good & welcoming, & all the service is excellent.  I had chicken pot pie, amazing.  I have been here more than once, friendly service & just darn good 'home cooked' type meals."}
{"text":"Not good. Hair on the muffin. Chicken was weird frozen chicken. Place smelled like a bathroom. Server was nice."}
{"text":"The food is always lovely. Nice portions and appealing presentation. They are known for their pastries and the pastries do not disappoint.   They are usual packed for breakfast so go early or be prepared to wait.   Service range is adequate to stellar but usually mediocrity reigns supreme."}
{"text":"Because of the time of year being close to Christmas the restaurant was very packed. The wait staff was running around with chicken like their head off while the manager just sat there not even participating or helping out. It was amazing to watch!!!  Their turkey dinner is good but the manager better figure out his crap because what should've taken half an hour to dine took over an hour. I didn't have time for that today."}
{"text":"My husband and I had not been back to this restaurant in several months.  We were very pleased with the quality of the food we had today.  My husband had pot roast with vegetables; I had the quiche.  Our server, Dannielle, was professional and very attentive.  We enjoyed our meal and will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Mimi's cafe, it is one of my favorite chains. I have been to several locations and the last 2 visits to this one was not the most pleasant due to the ridiculous wait for a table and the hostess running the show or at least thinks she does. 1st- We were told on our last visits that we could not sit on the patio, regardless of open tables and customers already eating out there. It was explained to us at great length that the serving staff that had been assigned the area was pulled to cover another section, for a sick staff member. I am sorry they are sick, and I do not need the story...  We then waited for 15 minutes in a throng of other customers and observed as the hostess barked, berated and snapped at customers and serving staff. no sign of the manager. If they keep her, they will lose business, and most likely staff too. This was not the first time we saw this I will probably wait a few months before going back. The food was good and servers were good."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! We came to Mimi's for breakfast on Saturday and had a great time.  I ordered the ham and cheese omelet with the pineapple upside down muffin and my guest got the salmon Benedict and we were very impressed. The staff was very polite. We had the large mimosas, the berry mimosa was amazing! The manager came and talked to us and found out it was our first time there and gave us a free muffin to take home. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place and it's fun to stop in once in while for an old favorite. I love their roasted turkey dinner, which recently seems to have gotten even better. The turkey is perfectly cooked, potatoes and gravy are creamy, and cornbread stuffing always amazing. The chilled cranberry sauce is refreshing. I tried the new deviled egg appetizer which I understood to be three eggs. It's actually three types of deviled eggs, nine halves! Way too much for one person but the three I ate were tasty. Mimi's has a surprisingly good wine selection and service is usually great. It's a relaxing experience; not luxury dining but it's pretty dang good!"}
{"text":"Allow me to start this review by introducing my partner in crime to the Yelp community; everyone meet Ashley D!  Ashley D was my date for this brunch meal at Mimi's about a week ago.  She enjoyed her previous experiences with Mimi's and recommended we try it out.  My initial impression of Mimi's for Sunday brunch was pleasant.  The decor and setting was fast paced and friendly.  The Cafe offered fresh coffee while you waited to be seated as they were slammed when we arrived.  We  were seated shortly and our waitress was easy going.    Both of us being benedict fans couldn't resist the plethora of menu choices in that category as you can tell by the photo I submitted.  The food was all enjoyable and we had a great time.  I'm definitely returning for my Sunday brunch with my partner in crime real soon."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty mediocre. I ordered the mushroom brie burger, it was good, nothing really special but the side of house salad was very delicious!  There was no hostess at the entrance so I kind of had to seat myself!  I'll probably visit this place in the AM to see what breakfast is all about! The lady server who helped me was very pleasant and quick!"}
{"text":"Cute French bistro! I love everything about this place. It's a tasty restaurant and bakery under the same roof. Prices are super reasonable for all meals. They have a great Sunday brunch too. Everyday they offer different specials from the bakery. After you order your meal you are always sent complimentary fresh baked carrot, raisin bread and baguette. Food is always fresh and portions are generous.  My favorite dish is their grilled chicken and guacamole sandwich. It's served on a warm lightly toasted, buttered baguette, chicken breast, lettuce, red onion and homemade guacamole. I have been hooked on this sandwich for almost a year now!  Come enjoy heart warming food in this beautiful French inspired bistro!"}
{"text":"First time eating here definitely will be back. Our waiter Ernesto was awesome. Had steak freties and my man had the Turkey dinner. Next time definitely having the salmon."}
{"text":"The mimosas here are amazing! The service was top notch. The food is slightly lacking. I had the avacado/ bacon omelet - omelet = good potatoes on the side= bad. Fruit was pre-esembled and refrigerated too long so it was exceptionally cold and flavorless because of it."}
{"text":"I went back and had the steak frite special and it was excellent . Flavorful and tender and the sauce and  seasoning on the frites very tasty . Some of the old American comfort classics are back and all in all , it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Mimi's on Stephanie is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. We eat out a lot - to all levels of restaurants. The French-like food at Mimi's is very tasty, well prepared, and reasonably priced. The service is always good. It is a great place for \"date night\" or Sunday after church. You will be happy and it won't break your budget."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for our server Jessica to come and when she finally greeted us, she said, \"I am sorry, I didn't know I had a table back here.\" My stepdad ordered coffee, which came after the rest of the party got drinks, since he had to ask again about it and we saw that the coffee wasn't making the entire time. The woman who dropped off our Articoke Dip tilted the plate too much when putting it down and spilt chips onto the table. I ordered the French Dip which wasn't impressive. The beef wasn't tender, it was chewy and dry. Corn chowder was very good. Server only came over when she had to, was not attentive at all. Never asked my stepdad if he wanted more coffee, or if she could clear some plates off the table. So we waited longer than we wanted to. Food did come out fast, but the restaurant was not busy at all. Bread pudding didn't really even have chocolate chips throughout it, was a little disappointed. The whiskey sauce tasted more of banana puree. All in all, we felt ignored during our meal."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this location a bad review, but this place USED to be my favorite breakfast spot. They claimed they changed their menu last August, but I was in here in early December and got my favorite meal (which is no longer on the menu.) maybe the chef felt like making it one last time, who knows. My waitress was slightly arrogant and the service was awful. Coffee wasn't fresh, my omelette had no flavor, and they also don't carry ranch anymore? Whatever! It's a sad thing that this place had changed so much, but I doubt I'll be coming back again. Sorry Mimi's, I keep giving you one more chance, and you let me down!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, something is up with the service..  We came in with a bogo entree coupon for breakfast and the lady said it's only valid if we ordered two drinks along with the entrees, so we did. We ordered an Arnold Palmer and coffee with our entrees (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oL9NfHwn_U9EF81H5TYe3Q/l.jpg, http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PwVbCmvVsMRma5j5jBGVrQ/l.jpg). Come to find out, the entrees COME WITH drinks. I was pretty pissed when the lady brought out all our drinks:http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TxahazJeRnCWYERTNKgScA/l.jpg. Isn't that just ridiculous? It was just stupid and I'm annoyed with the waitress for not warning us about that. We basically didn't get anything for free and we just wasted a couple drinks. I will say that I had no complaints with the food, but the whole drink situation just really bothered me. The only plus side from our visit here were the free muffins we got from doing the telephone survey located on the receipt we got."}
{"text":"I can't say anything of the in-house service as I've only ever gotten take-out from here, but based on that aspect of Mimi's, I'd have to say the food is always promptly made, the prices are reasonable, and everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious and generously portioned. The clam chowder is superb, and that's coming from a Rhode Island native."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mimi's! The service was great at this one and I had the stuffed blueberry pancakes! So so so good!! I wish we had one where I live....sigh....."}
{"text":"Generalized...been there a few times so, female mgr at night is horrible, general mgr is quick to respond to comment made on surveys.  Had a bad experience and had coupons for comp meal so went back.   Got Scott  that time and he had some booths and bar and started slow and took a few minutes but turned out to be really great which is why they get 3 stars.  French onion soup always good if hot but a lot of their meals are bland.  BUT the muffins and bread are really good."}
{"text":"Wow Mimi's ...  You sadden me , even with it being Sunday you could have done better, My suggestions if you want to inspire and draw in new clientele:   1)Get rid of the Helga manager/ hostess, she looked like she was miserable, she  seemed to be pissed all these customers were  around   2) Be prepared for the Sunday Crowd , when I see a empty unbused table right in front and you tell me it's going to be awhile , after already  messing up my groups table assignment ,I  would have left if my family wasn't  with me  3) Try a little seasoning in your food, it's this miracle substance that gives flavor to food   4) Have food ready fast ...it's Sunday we waited for our table , we waited for server to take our order ...now we wait  25 minutes more for our food?  Mimi's  Arrowhead   be careful or you will find even Sun City won't be coming in soon ."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Mimi's (on Durango), we go every other weekend.  The service is usually good, the food is generally great, I especially like going there for breakfast (the bacon is always great).  Usually if I don't like what I was served, it wasn't because the food was wrong, it was because I didn't like that item until I tried it.  They have messed up once or twice, but in my experience the only restaurants that get everything right every time cost $150 per person.  If I had any complaint it would be that they don't add new items enough.  When you go as frequently as I do, you tend to burn through the menu."}
{"text":"Have been here twice so far. Breakfast was phenomenal! We had the croissant Benedict (add tomatoes) and the brioche French toast. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was spot on.  Dinner...AMAZING!!! We had the pot pie (the epitome of comfort food) and the carbonara which was perfect. Pasta was al dente and the egg on top was still a little runny which is PERFECT to me.  You HAVE to try this place! If not, it's cool. We don't like it too crowded anyway ;)"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Mimis but it had been about three years since my last visit. My mother and grandpa decided they wanted to do lunch there and I was happy about it. I remembered the location in Mesa being better but since I used to live in Scottsdale, that was the one I frequented.   The menu was basically the exact same as it was three years ago. That could be good or bad. Take it as you will. It was SO crowded. Apparently every single person over 65 decided to go to lunch that Friday afternoon. The food was good but kind of expensive. My mother and I shared a sandwich since we're both small eaters and my grandpa ordered his own. The bill was still about forty bucks for two meals and three iced teas. Even if the food was good that was still YIKES!  But the service was what made me decide to stick to the Mesa location if I ever go again. The waiter took our orders, brought us our drinks once and then vanished off the face of the earth. Maybe he's Superman, IDK!  A busboy brought us our food and we had to ask another busboy for our bill. Our waiter made his final appearance just as we'd paid to thank us for coming in. It was awful nice of him to return after being absent for thirty minutes and making the busboy do his job."}
{"text":"Since we have a place in Southern California and Las Vegas, we have been visiting Mimi's Cafe's for years.  When we first found Mimi's we really enjoyed it.  And we still enjoy the surroundings and the good friendly service.    But over the years as menu's have changed, the quality in our opinion has dropped.  We had good friendly service today, but the food, a West Coast Reuben and a Mushroom Burger, were just not all that good.  The fries were cold, though the waitress did bring new ones, but they just had no flavor.  The sandwiches were bland and I can remember when the West Coast Reuben was one of my favorite items.  But not now.  I don't know what happened. The quality has gone down hill and the quantity just isn't as much as it once was.  I am OK with smaller portions, but come on, make the food with some taste and love."}
{"text":"Rating based soley on service as we didn't actually eat there. - Truly bizarre... walked in around 9am on a weekday. The place was virtually empty. Maybe four tables. There was an older couple sitting on a bench by the hostess station \"waiting\". The hostess looks at me and says \"it'll be a few minute wait\". I look at her like \"Huh\" as I look around the restaurant. She says \"were giving our servers a chance to catch up\". We were surprised but sat to wait. After about five minutes we looked at each other and went \"no way in hell. This is a really bad sign\" and out we went to IHOP across the streeet. Where we had both a good meal and fast and friendly service. Still mind boggled by being made to sit and wait in an empty restaurant while the servers \"catch up\"."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food has always been good and their bakery goods....so yummy!   This last time I was here though, was a big party foul. The waitress was, um, interesting. She spent most of the time flirting with my brother. One of my favorite lines from her was when she convinced him to try the brie artichoke dip instead of the original, ready, \"trust me, I'll dance on the table for you if you don't like it\". REALLY? Listen homeslice, not only are you flirting with my brother in front of my parents whom are across the table from him, but his wife is sitting right next to him! How do you not see the giant rock on her finger? But, I will say, it was really entertaining for me cause everyone else was super uncomfortable with it.  Haha, I laugh at awkwardness.   This waitress is also one of those that thinks she is too good to write down orders, well this time she should have because she wasn't paying attention. My mother orders, then I order the petite filet-medium, but the healthy one that skips the mashed potatoes and adds a salad. Simple enough right? Well, then my Dad orders and for his side gets muffin and I think to myself \"well, crap, they have yummy baked goods and its fall so they probably have their pumpkin muffin\" so then I say to her, \"oh and can I have a pumpkin muffin\" and she responds, \"is that all?\" and I say, \"yes\". With me so far? Okay so then my sister-in-law orders and then my brother orders and has to listen to her witty response. Boom food comes out. Guess what I get? Just my pumpkin muffin. Apparently homeslice thought I just wanted a pumpkin muffin instead of my petite filet. Yep, that happened. We all had a good laugh when the waitress walked away to put in my real order that we all reminded her about. So eventually it comes out, but its not the healthy one, I get the potatoes and instead of it being cooked medium, its well-done.  Listen, I don't send food back, cause I feel bad, but what an interesting experience I had here. If this was my first visit there is absolutely no way I would venture back. Alas, I enjoy Mimi's, but don't care for this particular waitress. This experience is one for the books!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mimi's I've been to so far. The service was great and the food was delicious as always. The only thing that bothered me was the akwardness of the atmosphere. Nonetheless, I'm not a big eater and I'm really glad they have a 'just the right size' menu..ahh."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with this review. We walked in on a Wednesday night about 7pm and the place was dead, there was literally one couple in the whole place. It took 5 minutes for the gossiping servers to notice us and come seat us. There were 4 servers and now we made the second table. It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come and take our drink order and it took him 20 minutes to tell us every special that we really didn't need to hear.  When we ordered they brought us cold hard bread. Getting a refill was like pulling teeth.  When the food came it was cold and sent back to be heated. Well microwaving turkey and mashed potatoes makes the turkey dry so we asked for more gravy that we got once we were ready to leave.  Not sure what happened to Mimi's but I can see them going under very soon."}
{"text":"Make sure you only go to eat here if you have TWO hours of your day to spend at a restaurant. The food was cold by the time we got it. The waitress's excuse when we asked when we would receive our food after an hour of waiting was \"sorry it's spring training and we are understaffed\" let's also not even mention how rude and inattentive our waitress was the entire time. Save yourself the headache and go ANYWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Our local Cerritos, CA Mimi's has experienced such a severe decline in service, menu choices and quality of food that I didn't have great expectations here.  WRONG, Wrong, wrong . . .   Our waitress, Amanda #4030, got it all right.   Good menu choices. Grandson ate first. Hungry and restless he devoured his pancakes. The majority of us followed with lunch choices from Caesar's Salad to pancakes to bouillabaisse to tomato bisque to French onion soup and assorted sandwiches. All delicious.  Attentive service. Amanda kept the drinks filled and her presence visible. She positioned a portable cradle at the end of our table so my daughter could eat while attending her infant. Fits any make or model carrier.  Looks like this http://www.amazon.com/Infant-Seat-Stable-Cradle-Color/dp/B003UCWI4G/ref=pd_sim_sbs_ba_1  Our late arrival joined us at the end of our meal. Amanda was right there with her meal and drink, tout d' suite.  Thank you, Amanda, for taking good care of a group of weary travelers."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe Summerlin: slow and inefficient service on Saturday May 7, 2016. Server Candace Candy  failed to bring our bread basket and meatball appetizer until end of meal. Never offered her apologies for her delayed service nor was the appetizer removed from the bill. Shame on you Mimi's Cafe Summerlin! Negative zero stars! Our family has been coming here for 10 years and lately the service and staff have just been disgusting!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I used to like this place. But I've gotten over it.  I find the food to be uninspired, and below average.  Blah."}
{"text":"It was a 45min wait to be seated and there was a ton of tables not filled it took for ever to get our food and there was just not a lot to choose from  there where only two of us I don't understand why it took so long"}
{"text":"We had breakfast on Sunday, 12/8/13, and were very impressed with the new menu. Both of us tried new items and found them very good.  A few weeks ago we had dinner and, again, we thought the new menu was a step up from the old one.  They kept some of their more popular items but the new items are special.  We have always enjoyed Mimi's, but we believe the new menu is an improvement.      Compared to other restaurants in the same mid-range category, I think Mimi's is a good value."}
{"text":"i have been a big fan of Mimi's cafe for years, since they started out in Southern California, and whenever I would go there to visit family in Huntington Beach, I would always ask for us to all go.  The problem with this is, although they are still very good, the menu is still diverse and loaded with comfort food I love (and which is a BIG theme in my reviews), the quality is not what it was and what I loved.  Their salad with walnuts and strawberries was one of my favorites, and even the menu says it has a touch of bacon, which is really that last flavor which brings it all together - BUT they consistently \"forget\" to include the bacon any more.  Used to be more generous with the breads and muffins, now you're lucky if they remember to give you even one.  Service is not as good as before, slow and slightly indifferent, which is also a change.  i am advised that the chain was bought by another entity which has tried to control costs, but being a looooong time customer, I have expectations based on when they were better.  I am not saying \"don't go\", I am just saying they used to be fabulous and now they are just another place to eat in a city where there are a LOT of choices."}
{"text":"I dislike Mimi's Cafe.  I always have.  I decided that, after a few years of avoidance that they would improve.  I was dead wrong.  Mimi's is still meh.  I had breakfast there with my mother while my father was in surgery down the street.  I ordered croissants, which were delicious, but the actual meal of potatoes, bacon, and eggs was horrid.  It was chewy bacon with bland eggs and oily potatoes.   Ew.  Sorry, but I dislike Mimi's for many reasons, all of which relate to their food and sad service."}
{"text":"Hello it was packed thank good we had a reservation we had to wait but not long we was seated fast took our order carrisa our server did a very nice job so that made it nice. You get a lot for thanksgiving dinner I was full lol anyways great"}
{"text":"Four friends and I had lunch yesterday at Mimi's for the second time in two weeks. The food there is so good and the service is exceptional.  We've been going to MIMI'S  regularly for several years but for some reason or other it was especially good yesterday I had the calamari with a terrific spicy marinara dipping sauce. The calamari was perfectly done, tender, with a crisp coating and not at all greasy.  I would definitely recommend their spinach salad with bacon, chopped egg and great balsamic dressing. Excellent!  Two others in our party had the bacon quiche with a side salad and they loved it.  Some entrées include a muffin, your choice of about three or four different kinds and they are so delicious and so fresh! Can't say enough about this comfortable friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Spent a long and stressful day at the hospital down the street from this location. Decided to stop at Mimi's Cafe for dinner on my way home. I walked into Mimi's in not the best of moods.... fortunately we had a wonderful waitress that was about to turn things around for me. She was very friendly, helpful and gave us amazing service. My kids loved talking to her and we ended up having a great dinner. A big thank you to Gi Gi for her service and sweet attitude."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the family enjoyed their dishes. Mum had the salmon, Sis had the pasta, me & lil man had waffles/croissant. I ordered a bowl of french onion soup and was satisfied with the taste. I loved it! Overall the service was good. We will be back there again."}
{"text":"They have the best butter croissant in town. It was served hot n fresh!. Ambience was perfect for the family. Our server Stephanie was very attentive & polite. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Took my dad out to lunch here for his birthday today! They have amazing lunch options so it was a great place to come. We got the mix and match option and got a half turkey sandwich and half French onion soup. It was the perfect amount to fill us up. I usually get their mimosas and they are my favorite in town! Our servers name was Bianca and she was amazing. Very attentive and polite. She made sure to bring out my dads birthday cake at the end and they all sang to him. I always have a great experience when I come to this location. Thanks guys :)"}
{"text":"Went this morning with my wife as I had received a buy one entree and get a second free.  Service was so so and the meal was okay.  The bad part was for one omelete and 2 coffees, the bill was $20.  It is way too expensive for that.  Not going back there again."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and I was very disappointed.   We had a table of 8 and had painfully slow and surly service by a waitress who appeared to be badly hungover. We suffered through missing parts of our meal, no refills, no check up to see how things were, and a long, long wait for our bill. Sadly the bad service wasn't the worst part. I had a sad turkey Reuben with no flavor and a soggy bun. I tried both    Thousand Island and Blue Cheese dressing to save the sandwich but neither worked since they were even more lacking in flavor. Salads had little meat, toast was burnt, and the amazing muffins tasted like bad supermarket muffins. My whole meal i kept staring at the In & Out Burger across the parking lot wishing I was there spending way way less on better food. Tons of other good places around here, this isn't one. Move on to one of the others."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe, was different in its own way, but only OK. We did go during lunch time, so I did expect it to be slow going.   Located in Henderson, off Sunset and Stephanie lies a nice looking restaurant called Mimi's Cafe. It had vibrant color on the outside, the setting inside feels more like a log cabin setting. Which was nice and warm feeling. The waiting area even had tables to sit at and menus to see what they had. It took about 10 minutes for us to be seated. Looking around the place, it was very well decorated. It had plenty of room to move around. The booth did have covers, where you don't have to be looking at the other people behind you or behind your eating partner and seeing other people stuffing their faces.   The staff so far is good, I did like the greeter as well as the person who sat us. We were greeted by our waiter who did took our drink, but he spoke softly, which was kind of hard to hear. Later on, we had a waitress who was training another waitress. I guess for training purpose, that they had to switch the waiter we had to begin with, to the waitress who was training the other waitress. Which was odd, but I'm sure they had their reasons.   Since it was the first time we been here, we were taking a while to go over the menu. Some things did look good, but didn't really excite me or stuck out as much. We did started off with the Asian appetizer, which consist of Coconut covered shrimp, Chicken Tenders and Pot Stickers. That was really good, we even ate the cole slaw that was part of it. The wife got a cheeseburger, I got a classic beef dip sandwich. Presentation was good overall, the taste was fulfilling and I did like majority of it.   Overall, if you are in the area, this might be a good place. I would suggest, not during the busy times. Of course I don't like going during the busy time, but we really didn't have a choice, it was just the time we happen to be in the area. But overall, it is a decent place to go eat."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good. The French onion soup is thick with thick slices of onion. All their pastas are decent, the sauce could use some thickening. Clam chowder and brocolli cream are really, really good. The blueberry bread is moist and crumbly. You'll probably pay too much for soup and sandwich so for just a couple bucks more, get an entrée. I like that they have hot tea bags on each table that come with all these flavors, like raspberry.   At this location, the waitress misunderstood and thought my dad was asking for a la carte instead of the combo. As a result she didn't bring out the fries, but 10 minutes later, we had the fries. Only downside to this location is that my dad almost got mugged in the same parking lot (not on this day, when he was alone). Since it's located in Desert Ridge, this can be expected and also this branch can be hard to find in such a huge plaza."}
{"text":"If you aren't in a hurry, then this place is perfect because the service and food run on no clock at all. Lack of attention to detail by the server and the food took way too long to come out. It wasn't even busy. I've worked in the restaurant industry for almost 10 years now, and I noticed everyone's food took awhile to come out. Though, I give 2 stars only because the food wasn't bad for the price."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and if you are in the area, one of the better choices for comfort food.  I have always liked mimis especially when we don't know what we feel like, everything there is pretty good and their bread is awesome.  Head and shoulders better compared to anything in it's class like Marie calenders or dennys.  Nice atmosphere and good service.    I do recommend their french onion soup, burgers, and pot pies."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Mimi's Cafe. The service and food was pretty good. I ordered a light meal, salmon and shrimp skewers w/salad and corn on cob. Nice atmosphere. Enjoyed it with friends. I would definitely visit this place again when in town."}
{"text":"Just called for a pick up order, the young lady who answered the phone informed me everything I wanted to order from the menu doesn't actually exist. SMH I didn't order anything"}
{"text":"First time here. Was traveling on business.  Found it thru yelp.  Great breakfast selection.  Food came out hot and cook perfectly.  Especially the bacon.   They also have espresso and the like.  Would come back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"At my most recent dining experience here, I was served the French Dip sandwich with Au Jus dipping sauce with a side of fruit. The service was timely and the waitress was very polite. The sandwich was OK. Both the French Dip sandwich and the Au Jus came warm; the toothpicks in the sandwich, however, did not aid in keeping the sandwich together, however. The taste of the sandwich was hearty and comforting. The fruit on the side tasted fresh, so no complaints for that. The meal itself was reasonably priced, so it's a great value, too!  A great place to go for some traditional American food. Great atmosphere, great staff, and great food."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with my lunch visit. Our server was in another world (aloof)! We had to keep on flagging her down for water and coffee refills. I had to even ask her for the basket of bread that they give you when they bring your drinks. You also don't give the raisin muffins anymore. Ugh :/. What i ordered i didn't care for at all. The grilled cheese was cold and the fries stale! My mom didn't care for her food either. Our check was incorrect as well. Honestly it was a headache even coming here. Such a disappointment! This used to be a place that we loved coming to. We will definitely not come back again."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunt's birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a \"tell\" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"Say!  My second five star for a review!....  OK...Here's the lowdown on this particular Mimi's at Avondale off the Dysart Exit on (HWY 10)---  Extremely easy to get to from the freeway going east or west bound.  it is on the north/west side of the freeway.  Me and a friend came for a quick lunch/dinner bite to eat after work...4:30 pm...The service was first rate, prompt, courteous, considerate of our timing needs IE: we needed time to talk and review the menu....The cleanliness was extremely clean!  The decor is Cajun in motif, and the over all layout is more than adequate for parties up to eight people....They may have a conference section..?(I didn't ask).  The prices are moderate, the place-settings spit / spot! and the atmosphere was welcoming.   I ordered the salmon with steamed veggies----Both were perfect!  Then afterwords I had the bread pudding in whiskey sauce!  Oh Man!  Again, perfect! But what impressed me the most---was the waiter's service and care to be considerate of our needs in timing, refills, our own space, and professionalism!  [if I were in a dump of an establishment, and received the service we received from this waiter, most places would probably get at least four stars!----lol]  I guess this means that the service actually means more than what goes into our mouth!  I'm looking for a genuine attitude of concern for our needs, more than the quality of the fare being served...Weird...I know....but true!   As it turned out though, the salmon was very well done.  Not dry or overcooked, and flavorful.  Parking is all around the restaurant and I felt completely safe, comfortable, at ease, and welcomed there.  Just watch the next person give this place two stars or worse...lol At this point though, I welcome anyone to---- 'Bone That's Petite' at this location."}
{"text":"Less than favorable experience  We have visited this Mimi's several times and have always enjoyed the food and service so we decided to give Mimi's a try for Easter. As we entered the restaurant we were seated immediately and shortly after our refreshments were brought to our table.   On this visit I went with the three course turkey dinner and my sister and nephew had the chicken strips, BBQ bacon cheese burger, and fries. Our entrees were brought to the table fairly promptly, however,  I was given the incorrect entree and when the correct meal was brought out it was stone cold.  We asked our server to heat up the meal and guess what?  The replacement meal was cold as well. My nephew and sisters entrees, were terrible as well.  The bun on the burger was hard as a rock and when we told our server her response was, \"sorry\". We ended our meal with a slice creme brulee cheesecake, and just like our entrée's, less then favorable.  The service was lacking, even though the restaurant was only 20% filled, the food was horrible, needless to say I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"I used to love Mimis. Not any more. We ordered 2 dishes, sent one back and ordered a third. All dreadful. The turkey in the turkey dinner was actually delicious. The rest of the meal was bad. The oriental chicken salad was dry and old looking, with almost no ingredients other than the wilted lettuce. We tried the Jambalaya which was to spicy for human consumption, with a horrid tomato sauce and un cleaned shrimp. The usually delicious muffin I got was dried out and over nuked. Mimis prices are not cheap and this meal was definitely un warranted. I am  going back to Cal Pizza Kitchen next time."}
{"text":"Ok never going back to this place again. Easter day nothing open, heard about this place figured it would ok. The host that walked us to the table and left without a word. Maybe an \"enjoy\" would have been nice. He then tells a server \"I sat you\" Server looks at our two top and grunts. Nice. I'm already so happy to be here. It just gets worse. The food tasted awful. Our server sneezed into his hands twice and kept working. We asked for side plates and he asked another server if there was another and she said this is the only one here and I don't know if it's clean. Talked to the manager after and he said sorry thanks for letting me know, but he never even asked where I was sitting. Never again."}
{"text":"We just love eating at Mimi's Cafe in Glendale. You feel like you are eating in someone's kitchen the place is so cozy. The food is delicious and they have added new items to the menu. The waitstaff is warm and welcoming. If you want a little piece of Paris in Arizona come to Mimi's for the food and atmosphere. My chicken crepes were delicious and my husband really enjoyed his pot roast dinner. Plenty of space for a wheelchair at the table!! Can't wait to go back for the yummy bread basket!! Nancy A."}
{"text":"Our group decided to come here for Sunday brunch. Prices range from 7.95 to 10.95 for breakfast or lunch. Some of us ordered the eggs benedict which was actually good. The turkey lunch was all right, the mash potatoes tasted like it was boxed and the stuffing was too salty. Someone also ordered eggs, fruit and croissant which was fine. The reason I'm giving two stars was the POOR SERVICE. Entering, the host didn't acknowledge us. No greeting at all. Not even a BON JOUR! The waiter never introduced himself. He seemed annoyed half the time. He didn't smile and was not friendly. Maybe the attitude is supposed to represent being in France (the total French experience) or he hated his job and he didn't want to be there. This company needs to revisit customer service 101 to their employees. I think we would of received better service at Denny's or Village Inn."}
{"text":"I don't know if I should give you a 1 or 0 stars for the alive roach that I found in my tacos. It made me want to throw up and leave. I will never eat at a MiMis again my entire life, unless I am forced to."}
{"text":"it was my first time here with my son and Family (Long time friends of the family) yesterday. We had a good Group about 10 and went here for a late lunch after having some of the group getting baptized at Central. Food was great, the Soups smelled as good as it looked (most of us did the Soup + Salad or half Sandwhich + soup/Salad. I had the BBLT + Ceaser salad, it was really good, bread was toasted salad was wonderful, my son ate his entire meal. toward the end of our visit right before our food came the Waitress did bring extra drinks and mentioned she was working that room alone, she was very polite, very helpful, great food, price is moderate so if your looking to spend a little then usual then I''d recommend going here."}
{"text":"Not even close to a good breakfast. Had their Pommes Lyonnaise Benedict. Hollandaise was grainy and separated. The Pommes was a gooey bunch of hash browns shaped into a circle and then tossed onto a griddle for half a second. The poached eggs were cooked properly. The bacon was soggy and sandwiched in the middle was soggy half cooked spinach. I asked for toast and received two \"toasted\" pieces of bread with no jelly, even though I was charged $2 for toast and jelly. The waitstaff is okay, very unobtrusive- which I like, and the pricing and food quality really isn't their fault. I won't be returning. The West Valley needs more brunch places!!!"}
{"text":"This Mimi's is near the Reach11 complex where we were attending a tournament.  So, afterwards, we came here.  The short version is that this is just like the Mimi's in Chandler.    The food is fine.  Not great, but fine.  The service was OK too.  Everyone enjoyed their food (I had the chicken pot pie).  None of it really struck me as \"French\", which is Mimi's motif, but it was good.  In fact, the kid had chicken picatta, which is Italian.  Not French.  They do have quiche, so maybe that's enough to claim to be a French-like bistro???  (Not in my book, honestly.)  Anyway, I'd call this place average.  Really, I should give it 2.5 stars, but that's not an option with Yelp.  An OK place to stop if you're in the area and looking for food.  You could do much worse."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Mimi's when I would be in town visiting family.  It used to be crowded and we'd have to rush to beat the line.  Sadly those times are done....I will not be back!  When we got there at 6pm the place was empty.  Score!?!  No, its empty because it has majority gone down hill.  We had 4 people and split 2 dinner for 2s and we got the baked brie also.  Regarding our 5 appetizers: baked brie bleh (better not melted and not enough bread), house salad OK, seafood crepe good, french onion soup salty, fried artichoke gross (only sauce was good).  Our entrees...not impressive.  The orange chicken crepe was nasty, walnut brie salad was OK, pot pie was more of chicken and veg with pasty on top (not a pie) and French dip was ok (lots of meat).    It came with a trio of dessert, bread pudding, apple cobbler, and chocolate cake ala mode.  Hit or miss.  My counterparts got theirs first (without receiving utensils...so I stole some from another table).  Their trio must have been old.  The chocolate cake was rock hard and the bread pudding was spongy and weird.  Our trio was better, but still nothing ro brag about.  So bad to ok food.  Service was the worst!!!  Took 2 hours. Our waitress Susan would say she's getting something for us and then disappear or go and talk story with other tables.  She brought 1 trio and forgot the other and lied and said \"it takes me a while to get them together so I wanted to get you one so you start eating\" (which we couldn't so anyways without silverware).  Later when I asked again she sais she would go in the kitchen and get them to make our trio...so I know her earlier comment was a lie.  Only another waitress ever filled our drinks.  And we saw at least 2 tables come after us and leave before us, and at least 1 of them had the dinner for two also so cant use that as an excuse for the delay.  Junk junk junk"}
{"text":"Come on guys. This place is the bomb not only for the fresh croissants and Texas style muffins to go to their breakfast and coffee. There is always a homey atmosphere and if you sign up on there website, they always send you 2-for-1 coupons. This is a hidden gem for a quaint brunch or a romantic date. Wait staff is excellent"}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend after getting a massage & I actually wanted panera bread [am I allowed to say that? woops]. I went to a Mimi's cafe once in Cali about 8 years ago, so I remembered it being like a fancier Chilli's or Fridays. I was more than satisfied When I left Mimi's. I ordered the broccoli cheese soup, with the chicken jack ciabatta. The soup was rich & creamy, and the ciabatta was so big I ended up taking it home. I shared the strawberry banana shake with my boyfriend & the server [thanks Georgina!] ended up splitting the shake & put them in two smaller glasses.  The decor in Mimi's is based off of New Orleans; they had plenty of paintings/frames of jazz artists, bourbon street & the chandelier/lighting was unique :) I wonder how busy it was this past Sunday for the Superbowl?! Anyway, I enjoyed my lunch & I will be back again!  *only thing I don't like is the location, people in the Arroyo shopping center can barely see Mimi's cafe because it's at the very end of the shopping center. I believe they're still extending the center, so we'll see what happens. Best wishes Mimi's!"}
{"text":"Found out they don't have lemon poppy seed muffins anymore, but they have the pancakes;  Haven't had that type of muffin for a year? Has it been that long since I've been here?   Ordered the bacon and eggs...only got about 8 small potatoes. $9.00 for this? Come on...  But, foods good.   SO Disappointed. Bring them back, please!"}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?? We've eaten here for many years and have watched the service steadily decline. This afternoon my husband and I arrived around 5:10 in the afternoon. Although the place was fairly empty, with many empty tables within our view, we were told it would be a 10 minute wait. After 15 minutes I finally asked when we would be seated - at one of the empty tables, only to be told there was 1 couple ahead of us!  After 5 more minutes we decided to leave. It was ridiculous. My husband asked to speak to the manager and asked why they keep people waiting when there are obvious tables available? I'm assuming he must hear a lot of complaints as he stood, with his hands in his pockets, smiling and listening to us. But offering no explanation other than saying \"well we can still get you in.\" The hostess mentioned earlier that it was due to a lack of servers. Excuse me. But it doesn't take much to seat people, bring them a menu and drinks. Unless the servers were back in the kitchen doing the cooking too! I know servers work hard but there were people dining and no servers in site. So why can't they seat people?  Sad to say we are crossing this off as one of our regular places to eat. Just wish management would pay attention. There was a time when you could barely get in the door. Now it's virtually empty yet you still can't get seated to eat. Very sad."}
{"text":"Went with friends for brunch on a Sunday...wait was about 20 minutes but wasn't too bad of a wait....we looked through both the breakfast menu and lunch menu while we waited (I liked that they were seperate)...we initially were seated at a table and it smelled a bit funny so we asked to be reseated and the hostess moved us to a booth in another area with no problem. It was busy in the restaurant so our waitress was hoping and boping but for the most part was checking back with us (her name was Jenna) (she eventually slowed down on the checks and I ended up having to share my water (I wasn't really drinking it as I had gotten a mimosa) with my friend who was out of water and the waitress hadn't been back around. I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with bacon which was good...my friend says her french toast was good and my other friends also got the breakfast sandwiches which were all good....peach mimosa was great and I tasted my friend berry minosa...wasn't a huge fan but to each is his own. Overall nice spacious place....pricing wasn't too bad and the food was good. If you come on a busy day have patience and all will be well :)"}
{"text":"They have really good food, but sometimes I feel like they could use better ingredients and change the menu a bit so that it can satisfy meat eaters with more quality cuts. Besides that, the food is great and service is amazing.  I feel like Mimi's is good for the price you pay over there. My family always goes there with coupons that they send in the mail, sometimes two entrees for the price of one, so you can't beat that!  Mimi's have comfortable seats and a very nice ambient with music and great wine! It's a tue 4 stars restaurant my friends!  I hope you enjoy visiting Mimi's as much as I do. I highly recommend you to order their Atlantic caught salmon with corn chowder and a side salad. Don't forget to order some appetizers like their calamari or their amazing garlic fries ;)  Mimi's is epic, just like this review!"}
{"text":"I  am giving 4 stars for excellent service. Alicia was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive on a busy Valentines night. My sole was tasty but after the second bone in 6 bites it was too stressful and they gladly removed from our check. I declined a substitute as C's buttermilk battered onion strings were rocking and the bread was awesome. His fish and chips were fat, flaky and delicious with the accompaniment of a fresh made coleslaw. Tomato soup was a comforting beginning as well. The value for the price here is great."}
{"text":"Loved the service and food! Thanks Michelle and chef!   I was craving rotisserie style chicken and I love pasta. SO they had 2 separate dishes, one being the Roasted Half Chicken w/2 sides and another being the Coastal Shrimp Pasta. I literally asked for just the roasted chicken from the one dish and the pasta without the shrimp from the other and VOILA! DELICIOUSNESS !"}
{"text":"Great food. Had breakfast at noon. Poppyseed pancakes, sunny side up eggs and turkey sausage. Yum! It would be five star, but it took forever to get seated and there were a lot of open tables. BUT, worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Mimi's Cafe since the mid 80's when I lived in So Cal.  It was a favorite of my parents and I've been a fan ever since they first took me there.  I was extremely pleased when the franchise opened locations in Phoenix.  For me, Mimi's fits the bill as the best chain restaurant around.  It has a fun atmosphere with a casual French theme.  It features cloth napkins and fresh flowers for dinner.  Lunch is a bit more casual but no less delightful.  Their food and service is pretty consistent from location to location.   All locations have a full bar with a decent selection of wines and beers.    This morning's breakfast experience at this location at the Desert Ridge Marketplace was particularly good.  For starters we had a extremely friendly and attentive server.  She obviously enjoys her work and is very good doing her job.    We were with our teen son and nephew who are both pretty big eaters but even they were unable to finish all that they ordered.  I ordered Eggs Benedict which is a breakfast favorite of mine.  Mimi's does a pretty good job with this well known breakfast dish even though they use ham in place of traditional Canadian bacon.  Not certain their hollandaise is freshly prepared but it's pretty good . . . not as tangy as I like it, but tasty.  My wife ordered fresh berry crepes with creme cheese filling which I sampled.  They were very good as well although they reminded me more of blintzes than crepes.    Their applewood bacon is thick and tasty with the right amount of smokiness. Their signature muffins are always a treat especially the carrot spice and blueberry ones.  I believe their morning fruit juices are freshly squeezed and hence, very flavorful.  Mimi's for lunch and dinner is equally good.  They feature lunch and dinner combos that include an entree, soup or salad and a mini dessert with special pricing.  Their corn chowder soup is a family favorite.    Our family really likes this particularly location.  It's located in a nice part of town with lots of other eateries and a terrific outdoor shopping area.  I recommend all Mimi's locations but this one is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Mimi's for over 30 years and I am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point, at least at this location.  I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.    The biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.  Our server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.  Although I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live."}
{"text":"Great food. We also ordered drinks which were super delicious. My wife and I had trouble selecting a plate because they all looked great. Also the decorations are very cute. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat here for other meals, just breakfast.  They've got some decent dishes and actually just added some new $5.99 breakfast plates. On my visit this past weekend, I ordered up their egg, cheese & jalapeno enchiladas, which come smothered in a tasty tomatillo green sauce. I also added a side of red skinned breakfast taters for 99c.  We like to order up their \"hibiscus coolers\" with our late morning breakfasts. Sparkling wine + cranberry juice. Try it out!  If you sign up for their \"E club\" you get a free breakfast coupon on email. It's a risk free way for you to try them out! http://www.mimiscafe.com/EClub.aspx"}
{"text":"The dip sandwich was too salty and dry. I got charged for a few extra veggies I didn't get extra of, then charged extra for walnuts for my walnut salad. When I talked to the manager about it she had a snarky attitude, but then took the charges off.  There is no music just silence besides the group of servers and a manager talking trash about the place in the front of the house for all to hear.  This was my first time going and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service the restaurant was not busy at all they got my order wrong it took forever to get my glass of wine. I was very unhappy with the service one time before this decided to give it another try what a mistake. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"We order from here all the time... Lately when we do take out there is something wrong... It's the salmon is dry or no bread or no ketchup or totally forgot a meal or called the order in 25 minutes ahead of time and when u get there u wait an additional 45 minutes. They have went down since the business was sold. If u order take out double check you order..."}
{"text":"Ended up at Mimi's after a nice hike again... those darn coupons that are too good to pass on : ) Kendra was our server again and it was overall a good experience. I will start claiming that booth as our 'regular table'.  Daughter and I had the surf and turf (with some sort of Greek salad -really good- and corn on the cob), hubby had the NY strip with frites. We also had the spinach/artichoke dip appetizer. Even with the coupon for a free entree it ended up being a hefty bill (send me more!). Also I had filled out the survey for a free birthday crepe/cake and it was really good.... we may even be back : P"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a working lunch with a team mate and I was quite impressed with the service. Our host, a young man, was very friendly and accommodating to my request for a booth.  Our server, a young lady with very short blond hair (I wish I remembered her name) took great care of us. She was very nice and friendly while I waited for my team mate to arrive. Some places don't even sit you unless your whole party is there. We never had to ask for a refill, she answered our questions and made some recommendations. I ended up having a ham omelette with broccoli, lots of butter, and it was overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast at this Mimi's on our way out of town and oh my... what a disappointment. I have been to Mimi's at Desert Ridge and Metrocenter, and they have been OK, but we would never come back to this one.  The food was very plain, the plate looked huge with just a few potatoes... My husband ordered hot tea and the cup they brought him was nasty. I understand some stains are hard to remove, but I did clean some smudges with my finger...  When we brought it to the attention of our waitress, she behaved like, 'oh there are just coffee stains...' but still took it to replace it.  Since no one brought another cup, we asked the person that brought our food, (yep, that is how long it took) and just then she was in her way to our table... She even said it took her so long because she had to go 'hunt' for a clean cup... What kind of excuse is that?  We also had asked for crispy bacon, she even wrote it twice, and yet we got regular bacon. We sent it back and even after that it was not crispy at all... So yeah, they didn't pass the crispy bacon test.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"Had a bogo voucher so came in for breakfast. I had breakfast tacos with side of breakfast potatoes which were nice.  Johan had corned beef hash Benedict which when arrived looked a little sad, it's not served with an English muffin. Coffee was revolting, tasted like dirt. Server was inattentive and didn't know the menu very well. I'll only return with another bogo."}
{"text":"I had the Eggs Benedict.  The English muffin was like cardboard (OK, that may be a little flattering), and the sauce was flavorless and failed to add anything to the eggs.  The juice came in something akin to a shot glass.  There are lots of better choices to get breakfast in Las Vegas than this place."}
{"text":"Giving a 4 star simply because we are treated really well each time we come here. Food wise, I'd give a general 3 stars to Mimi's. Thats just an general overview though and not all inclusive. I love their Mac n Cheese, and their turkey is all slow roasted right there so it's not sandwich meat! Today, I had the West Coast Ruben. It has turkey and ham instead of the traditional pastrami. It was good. A little light on the dressing, but definitely worth getting. It is a really good sized sandwich. Would I get it again? Probably. I would probably get something else before it on most occasions, but it was a good lunch sandwich. I'm glad I got it. As it was over 100 degrees already outside at 11:50am when we walked into the restaurant, it wasn't too heavy of a meal. I got the fries with it. I love Mimi's fries.   The reason for 4 stars though, is how well we are treated every time we go in here. We always have really great servers, regardless of how busy they are. But it's not just the servers, it's the little things. Like walking through the restaurant to use the facilities, the staff promptly and courteously move out of your way to make sure you can get by. Something you would think would be common sense, but most other family style restaurants don't abide by. The greeters at the door are always pleasant, quick to welcome and never missing a \"Thanks for coming!\"    We like Mimi's enough to come down from Sunrise Mtn. to eat here."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! We arrived, no hostess, customers all over the lobby. Poor customer service. The manager came out and started taking people out of the instead of who was on the list. My party left along with others.   This was a good location, lost a customer today."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Portions are large and the price is very reasonable. They also have delicious homemade muffins that come with your meal. My husband and I both had omelettes and they were delicious. The service is wonderful - they're efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"There is a time and a place for everything. I learned that lesson last month. I was walking down the street and some uptight square walks up to me and says \"do you realize you are naked from the waist down?\"  I stared at him. He said in a very excited voice, \"do you realize that you are drinking gasoline and smoking a hand rolled...um...something.\"  I said I did.  He screamed. He screamed loud. I walked away...some people are just crazy and it is best to get away as fast as possible. When you hear someone screaming about pants, gas, and the fall of mankind you know what to expect.  Mimi's Café is much like that insane man.  Anyone who goes there with the idea that this is going to be anything except for comfort food might as well start screaming on the street because you are nuts! I have been to Mimi's about 10 times and each and every time three things happened...there was good service, there was good food and there were good specials.  To me, your future king, that makes a good restaurant. I don't need finger bowls, 80 dollar bottles of wine and Baked Alaska to consider it a great place to eat...of course if I am eating Baked Alaska it means that I have travelled back in time to 1986, and I probably had a main course of Chicken Kiev.  So, I know you have questions. What is good to eat? How did you get so great? Why do we need to wear pants?  All good questions, and I will answer some of them in my new book \"The Pantsless King.\"  I will answer the first question now.  The best thing on the menu is the Chicken Cordon Bleu. Simply amazing. Perfectly panko breaded chicken with ham and swiss cheese. The best in the city...yes...the BEST in the city. More good stuff...Country Fried Steak, Chicken Pot Pie, and the grilled meatloaf.  Not feeling the classic comfort food? Okay...go to hell...but okay...try the French Classics. The quiches are terrific. Light. Fluffy. Eggy. Deliciousy. I would recommend the Quiche Lorraine. Bacon. Green onion. Cheese. Yum. That's right...I said yum.   Not feeling the French...I understand. The last French I felt was really hairy where it mattered...Rex doesn't dig that. Go with a sandwich or a salad. The best sandwich is the Chicken Jack Ciabatta. I am a sucker for Ciabatta...Ciabatta, women who sweat and shiny dimes.  The Turkey Pesto Ciabatta and the West Coast Reuben are very good as well. All of the sandwiches are large and worth the reasonable cost. Best salads are the crispy chicken and the BBQ chopped.    Tip: Never eat yellow snow.    Tip: Sign up for their specials.  Tip: Love Rex with all your heart.  Tip: Hide your money from Rex...he is a fiend."}
{"text":"Ate here last Saturday...top notch meals and service! Hector served us, from start to finish he was very kind, attentive and professional. The breakfasts were amazing..and very yummmmy Mimosas!  Great start to our morning"}
{"text":"It was 5 O'Clock somewhere but 10:45 AM on Mimi's patio. No one was sitting at the other four tables in the shade and slight breeze on warm day.   It was relatively quiet with some road noise from Shea and a view of Red Robin across the parking lot.  I started with Sam Adams and \"bread\" plate (zucchini bread, french roll) and finished with a very large pan seared scallop on four tasty raviolis with sauce.  Overall a good choice for a light lunch."}
{"text":"Godawful. Probably the rudest hostess in Scottsdale. Was told we would wait 15 minutes, 45 minutes later we were unapologetically informed that the kitchen was slammed so they weren't seating anyone else. Is this your first Sunday brunch, Mimi's? Teach your employees about customer service and staff accordingly...and if it's going to be 45 minutes, just say it up front instead of making people wait."}
{"text":"Id been wanting to try Mimi's for awhile and finally found the time. We get seated rather quickly and serves our drinks in a timely manner. The server was amazing, he kept checking on us and offering his help with making suggestions. Shortly after coming back for that final time to see what we would like to order our pleasant meal took a turn for the worse. I order the half chicken and am told they are out of chicken. I end up getting chicken parmigiana and my first gets pot roast. My meal was just bland tasting and his pot roast was literally a small slab of meat. We thought there would be vegetables but I guess not. I probably wouldn't go back especially for the price. Our meal cost us 45$. If I'm paying this much Id like to see the staff in decent clothing and not jeans. Id also never want to sit where I can see the kitchen from my seat again this made us very uneasy about our meal. I would avoid Mimi's unless you enjoy a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Ya know how much I despise chains so I had very low expectations of this place.. while I still don't care for cookie cutter consistency (ccc), I was surprised that my lunch was alright. I let the server order for me who's name ironically enough was Alex. She ordered me the turkey salad sandwich on raisin bread and a side salad with balsamic dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh as well as perfectly dressed. The sandwich was pretty tasty.. huge tender pieces of turkey breast dressed in a light mayo sauce with walnuts and celery. The bread was warmly toasted and slightly sweet, a perfect compliment to the savory turkey salad.   In all, not to bad.. while I would still never go back I would have to say that Mimi's was a-okay!"}
{"text":"Managements poor planning makes for an unpleasant experience. Waited 30 min to be seated which is typical for breakfast on a Friday morning, but waiting 45 min after we order for our food to come out is absurd. The managers have no clue what is going on, probably hired with no skill, no know-how on scheduling, estimating traffic, or management skills. Second time being here and I will never be back. Stick to local places where they still care."}
{"text":"Mimi's on Shea is under new ownership / management. The soda was $3.29. The food was good."}
{"text":"A group of us went there for dinner. It took almost an hour to get our food. My food was dry and cold. One person only ordered soup and she was the last person to be served. The kitchen is totally disorganized.  Our waitress tried her best but it was a losing battle. She never came back to offer more water.  We were in a back room and it was so noisy that you couldn't hear yourself think.  We made a reservation for 14, they set the tables up for 10. That should have been the first clue that this would not go well. I would pass on this location. We usually go to the Mimi's on N. Durango and have had much better food and service at this location.  Take a pass on this particular Mimi's."}
{"text":"This place has the Best muffins!  The rest of the menu is good too.  But be sure to ask for the bread basket."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout via phone. After placing my order I was told I was getting transferred  to \"quality control\" for correctness of my order and the total (what?... LOL!) but was hung up on. They called me back and I found my order  was totally wrong but \"quality control\" happily corrected the order. And by the way their online menu is not correct.... they don't offer 3 course meal deals, no broccoli cheddar soup, no molten cake which are all listed on their online menu.  Anyway we picked up our food: meatloaf with mashed potatoes and broccoli, tomato basil soup, french onion soup and  creme brulee cheesecake. Everything was very good  (except I was not a fan of the  cheesecake, just not my favorite version of cheesecake). I especially liked the french onion soup. Will return."}
{"text":"It took about 15 minutes before the (flamboyant) waiter finally took our order! I ordered the overly -priced grilled, blackened salmon for $14.45. First of all, it arrived NOT blackened, so I had to send it back...When it came back, it was hardly even blackened at all! The portion size was sooo small and lookied NOTHING like the picture on the menu! (Reminded me of like when you buy a TV dinner at the store, and the picture is nothing like what's inside the package). There were hadly any veggies as well as the brown rice... I left there still hungry, actually...Their portions always seem to be on the small size, but their prices are far from small. The waiter must have said \"I'm sorry\" literally 10 times. It was getting annoying, actually. Their muffins, on the other hand, are great."}
{"text":"My mom, sister and I went here for dinner last night. Jessica was our server. EVERYTHING was EXCELLENT!!!! Jessica was AWESOME!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give more than 5 stars in this case because this place deserves it. Mimi's is in our neighborhood but up until two weeks ago we had never tried it. We had relatives visiting and one of them suggested it so we went. It was excellent! The decor is interesting and the atmosphere is fun. I liked it as soon as we walked in. We only had to wait a moment to get a table. The menu is awesome. I could not make up my mind there were so many things to choose from. The menu is made up a lot of those familiar comfort foods like meat loaf, pot pie, salisbury steak, etc. But you can also get mexican, seafood, sandwiches, burgers and more. We ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer and they were seriously some of the best we've ever had. And we lived in Japan for 9 years!!! They serve a basket of complimentary bread. The bread isn't just plain old bread either. There was carrot bread and lemon bread. Excellent! I ordered one of their salmon dishes. It was covered in a honey dijon sauce and was perfect. Salmon is one of my favorite foods and I'm pretty particular about it.  I was impressed with the staff. They were all friendly. The food came out very quickly. I also really appreciated the fact that they brought out snacks for our toddler. When they brought us a highchair they also brought a cup of cherrios and a package of crackers. I am always happy when a restaurant lets you know that it is okay that you brought your kids along. As many parents know, you can often get the feeling that, even though they claim to be a family restaurant, they wish you'd left the kids home. Mimi's made us feel totally welcome. It was a terrific experience. We only eat out once a month and we're planning on going back to Mimi's for our next outing."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with a coupon (thankfully). Before we arrived, we read the mixed reviews, so our expectations were low, but we needed a bite to eat and thought we'd give it a try.   I ordered the petite filet steak with vegetables and balsamic greens. Our server warned us that the portion size would be small - \"Nothing like Outback\". He was right. My steak was about 3\" long and 2\" wide. It was pretty tough as well.   My husband started to order the Hibachi Salmon, but again, our server warned him that it would be nothing like \"Hibachi\" style - more like a glazed salmon. My husband went with the country fried steak with mashed potatoes, white gravy, and vegetables. He said it was edible, but nothing he'd return for.  As new patrons we were given two muffins as we left. You can tell the management is making an effort to improve; however, with so many other food options around, there is continued room for improvement."}
{"text":"Very Good place to grab some Breakfast. The potatoes are excellent. I Ordered a Hot Chocolate and it tasted as good as it looked, which can go either way with Hot COCO! Ha! So what was really impressive was the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. I don't know how they pull it off but \"Mimi's Cafe\" dips the Cinnamon bun and makes some of the best French Toast I haven't ever had.  I took one star away from Mimi's Cafe because they are so busy it was hard to leave when I was ready."}
{"text":"Really great food and I like that it's family friendly. The service was great too and our waiter gave great recommendations and was very polite. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Manager Brett was amazing and he went above and beyond to check on every table to see how our food tasted. Great first time experience!"}
{"text":"For a chain this place is not too bad. I honestly can't say they serve food that will blow you away... but for me it's always been consistent and ... ok!   In my opinion it is the bakery items that make this place! I love the muffins and some of the breads are yumm-o!"}
{"text":"Not to sound like a broken record... but everyone here is right. I would honestly give this place ZERO stars if I could.   My best friend and I came here today to enjoy a nice lunch and walked out five minutes later. There was a man in glasses who greeted us and started getting our menus. My girlfriend said, \"we'd like to sit outside.\" He didn't hear her or stopped paying attention because another server showed up (I believer her name is Samantha) and started ARGUING with him... right in front of us! Then he tried to seat us in the dining area and I repeated what my friend said: we want to sit outside. Apparently he couldn't seat us outside, so we had to wait for Samantha to come back. Then, another server showed up and asked if we had been helped, and we told her we were still waiting to be seated. Samantha shows up and starts arguing with BOTH of the servers, and then the guy decides to walk us out to the patio instead of her. She rolls her eyes and says, \"well I guess I don't know what the hell is going on so yeah...\" as we walked past her.  We were seated at a dirty table. Our waiter told us he would get a busboy to clean off the table before taking our order. We waited... and waited... and waited... until finally a new server (what the hell?) shows up. His name is Tito. \"Yo, my name is Tito and I'll be ya'll server today.\" You're kidding, right? I snapped at that point. First of all, don't talk to me like we're in the hood. Second of all, where's the busboy?! So, I told him we're still waiting for a busboy to clean off the table. \"Oh, my bad. I'll go get that for ya'll real quick.\" No. We walked out.   I know I write this in most of my reviews, but I am so sympathetic to servers and busboys. My family owns a restaurant and I know exactly what they go through... but as busy as it gets and as irritated as we are, we NEVER show it to the customers. Our servers also speak English, not ebonics.  So, ended up going to a place called Scramble. Amazing... about to write a 5 star review for them instead."}
{"text":"We have a large family of 11, we love coming here.  The staff is so welcoming when we show up, very helpful."}
{"text":"If I could give it a -0- I would.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated.  Finally sat, and ordered our food.  Coffee was old (bitter), when the food came the server never came back to ask how it was, or offer a refill on our coffee.  My friend ordered Eggs over Medium...she got eggs that were not even over easy & her home fries were cold.  I ordered a Turkey Crepe with Brie.  what I got was an egg crepe that I dug through to find no turkey and no brie, but melted cheddar or maybe some other kind of cheese.  the waitress then dropped the check didn't say a word.  on the way out I asked for the manager's name and the girl asked what was wrong, I told her and she said that is too bad, do you want a free muffin?  Do I want a free muffin? No, I didn't get what I ordered, the food was awful, my friend had cold food....no one asked us if our food was ok or not....no one offered a second cup of coffee.  then a manager walked over and said well maybe you just didn't taste the turkey, and I said there was no turkey or brie...he said well sorry about that....really???? sorry no I didn't eat, I moved the food around the plate, it was awful. No one seemed to care. I will write a letter to the general manager because I wasted $30.00  DO NOT GO HERE.....and if you do if you get Jaime as your wait person, asked to have your seat moved.  Horrible Service, Awful food experience......and the table where we were seated was sticky and not very clean........never again."}
{"text":"Try the half sandwich - soup combo for lunch! French onion soup w/melted cheese & toasted turkey & bacon sandwich! Hot, tasty, definitely a do-again! Professional, friendly serice! Yum & Yay!"}
{"text":"I have had 3 bad experiences in a row. I decided it was time to write a review. The food here is sub par at the best. The service is slow and forgets all the time. I have complained to the management and they always take the meal off the bill. But I don't want a free meal I want a meal. It used to be very good that is why I kept returning. But this pas Tuesday was the last straw. I ordered a cob salad. It tasted like the salad had been pre-made and put in the refrigerator. The salad was so cold you could barley bite into it. But the turkey was the worst. It was large chunks broken off. It was dry and old and dark edges curled up the turkey. Definitely not fresh. In the past 2 experiences I have had soggy eggs and runny, cold dinners and the presentations are un-appetizing. Also do not get their Iced Tea. It taste rancic.  This Mimi's needs a complete over haul."}
{"text":"I went to Mimis Cafe with a couple of girlfriends thinking I would give in another chance after my last bad experience there over a year ago, and unfortunatly nothing has changed.  I ordered the French Dip, it was so salty I think I drank 3 glasses of water while I was eatting.  You have a choice of fries, fruit, or salad as a side.  I ordered the fries because the picture in the menu made them look amazing, this was not the case.  They were the worst fries I think I have ever had they were limp and soggy.  I wish I could say the service made everything better but it didn't."}
{"text":"Tried the smoked salmon egg Benedict.  Wasn't very impressed as the hollandaise sauce tasted very chalky. Needless to say, I ate it all as I was starving and the side of roasted potatoes were delicious! The house coffee was just ok. The menu was extensive with a variety of different items which can appeal to anyone. The service was also very fast and attentive. I would give it another go and stick to more common American items like French toast or sandwiches."}
{"text":"My experience with this Mimi's Cafe was EXCELLENT. My friend and I placed an order for pick-up, and were very impressed with the employee that took our order. He was very friendly, professional, and SUPER knowledgeable about the menu (what is on certain menus, how items are prepared, the sides they come with, etc.). Our order was prepared as requested and promptly ready for pick-up.  Because many restaurants I have been to prepare their salmon with loads of nasty oil, I really appreciate that Mimi's Cafe has a salmon and vegetable dish that is prepared without oil or butter."}
{"text":"The bar tender Jessika was very professional and timely with my service. She is very dedication and devotion to the company and her customers.  Jessika is a role model for all employees in the customer service industry.  Alan the General Manager was very polite and supportive of his staff."}
{"text":"My fiance and I paid $34 yesterday for a Monterey Chicken Burger, a Beef Dip au jus, a Melon Margarita, and a Strawberry Lemonade. The food was not good, the service was not good, and I will not return to this location.   The chicken burger was too big to fit into my mouth, and I'm not a small person. I had to tear it apart to eat it (very messy), and was really disappointed because it was really a HUGE portion: a whole chicken breast, half an avocado, 5 slices of thick bacon, huge gobs of swiss cheese. It would have been so much better as an \"edible\" sandwich. My fiancee's beef smelled/tasted old - like lunch meat. The Melon margarita was overpoured with Tequila. The strawberry lemonade was actually very delicious.   In regards to service, we were seated promptly, but our waitress was incredibly terse and impatient with us. When she stopped to check in on us, she leaned over to us and walked away before we could respond. We saw other tables receive bread as they were seated and we sat and waited for our food for over a 25 minutes without ever being offered any bread. The service was what I would consider \"minimal\".   I love Mimi's Cafe normally, but I don't like this location - go to the one by Chandler Fashion Center."}
{"text":"Had a really nice Valentine's Day dinner at Mimi's!!  Our server, Mae, was very attentive and accommodating.  They had a dinner package that included soup or salad, a choice of entrée plus dessert/coffee.   My husband and I were both very happy with our dinners.  My only complaint (and it wasn't a biggie) was that my shrimp dinner was to include a vegetable--instead it had come with salad on the same dish as the entrée.  I love salad, but already had a dish of it before our dinners came out!  It seemed pointless to send the dinner back because I didn't get the vegetables instead---but I was overwhelmed with salad and got tired of having it twice.   Other than that, we had a great time and Mimi's keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"All of the employees are very attentive and make sure you that you're everything is going well and if you're happy. They Make sure to ask you if this your first time here. The French onion soup is to die for. Ask for bread basket."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing so I always treat myself to the best on the menu the chop cobb salad it's simply wonderful and you get a muffin"}
{"text":"Embarrasingly bad Beef Bourguignon!   I just had dinner there and felt inspired to write a review (warning?!) for others.  I steer clear of fresh fish and steaks at places like this, opting for the safer dishes that you shouldn't be able to mess up.  But did they mess it up!   My 'Bourguignon' was a giant single hunk of beef (like a pot roast) with a bit of sauce poured over it.  There were a miniscule number of mushrooms in the sauce, and the onions - red sliced onions - were raw and bitter (as in a salad).  The carrots were served on the side along with brocolli, like a steamed vegetable accompaniment. Now, a bourguignon should have cubed beef, and the onions, carrots, and such should be cooked in the broth for over an hour, infusing them with the flavors of the sauce.   They do have a 'pot roast' on the menu - \"Slowly braised chuck roast with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables\" - I think that's what they served me. This is the description for their bourguignon: \"Tender chuck roast simmered in a flavorful vegetable stew with mushrooms, carrots, red onions and seasonal vegetables. Served with mashed potoates\" - I wonder if the 'chef' knows the difference?!  Edited to add: I also got off to a bad start here; our waiter started out with 'have you dined with us before?' - this has become a trigger to me and immediately puts me on the defensive (the first thing I want to hear is, 'can I start you out with a drink or appetizer?').  So if I say no, does that mean I'm going to have to listen to him rave on about how good their food is, and help me read their laminated, over-produced menu?  Or is he going to sell me on their 'signature desserts', or their 'buy 5 get one free' program?  If I say yes, is he going to ask me what my favorite is ... It seems such a pointless question ... (like the current fad of \"did you find everything OK?\" at the grocery checkout ... what are they going to say if you are honest and couldn't find half the stuff you wanted ....?)"}
{"text":"Good food but definitely overpriced. We went for breakfast and not sure if we will try lunch or dinner. Easily spent 12 each for breakfast which is to much."}
{"text":"leroy was 5 stars , exceptional service and very friendly . food was a good value , soda pop is overpriced , food was good not excellent but good enough to return and try other menu selections , espescially if leroy is my waiter !"}
{"text":"I'd rather eat in a local place and Mimi's is, after all, a chain. Yet they really try to please with their menu and service is usually good. I sat at the counter on my last visit to the location at 75th Ave/ Bell Rd on a Sunday. It was a madhouse in there, but my waitress was a top notch juggler and kept me and the whole counter happy."}
{"text":"As far as food goes, I didn't try anything special...others can give you a more helpful review of the food.  The Friday lunch service was pretty bad, though. It took our waiter longer than expected to show up for drink orders. It got worse from there.   My guest ordered the bottomless soup and salad combo. When the food finally arrived -- again, more slowly than it should have -- she got her soup, but not the salad. Her soup was gone before the salad arrived. She had to ask another wait to bring it, and to bring another serving of soup. By the time her soup refill came, my meal was done. Drink refills were a problem, too.  It wasn't like you could blame the lunch rush: We arrived around 1:15 and were seated immediately.  Disappointing. The menu looked intriguing, but that's no cure for poor service."}
{"text":"In Peoria Arizona and in San Bernardino California the wait time at Mimi'a is always in excess of 20 minutes despite the fact that half the tables are empty."}
{"text":"It was my first and my last time at Mimi's Cafe.  I heard the food was pretty good . I heard the breakfast  is even better . Walking in a family was walking out and talking about how delicious  the food was . So I was alright this place had got to be good . Well I was dead wrong . I had ordered the turkey club sandwich and my girlfriend  had the chicken avacado sandwich.  And let me tell you both of them were dry and very Blain . The food had no taste , you would think the avacado would give it some flavor but it added nothing to it . I would of had a better time at subway . The service  was great though our server Daniel was very nice and knowledgeable young man ."}
{"text":"Wish I could tell you how the food was. We walked in and where seated. We never saw anyone that worked there again. After waiting 15 minutes and not even getting water we got up and left. The restaurant was not busy and we saw no one who worked there as we left. This was on a Saturday at 6:30pm.  We had been told the food was good I can only hope they can do some training. When the hostess sat us she could have asked if we would like something to drink. We ended up at IHOP and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place. We go frequently. There's always a table and the staff knows what they're doing. My favorite is quiche Lorraine. Pretty much the only place you can get it. My mom loves the salads."}
{"text":"This Mimi's is the worst. The vibe is as if they are a restaurant in training. My server was nice but slightly flustered.  I ordered the benedict with bacon and tomatoes. When you look at the picture on how it was served it was sloppy and made with no care. Mimi's has always given some presentation but this was food on a plate.  It looked a mess and then I put my fork in it had egg shells inside. I said to my family I knew this dish looked off when it arrived and now egg shells.  I told my server and she was great about getting me something else and apologizing. So I ordered my next usual the Quiche Lorraine taste great but once again thrown on a plate. Typically its served on lettuce with fruit on a plate. This was not the case.  Low Fat Blueberry muffin was great as always..  This location just didn't feel welcoming and the experience was subpar, management they need help."}
{"text":"Originally went to Mimi's looking to continue the quest for the ultimate Chicked Fried Steak. Mimi's does not serve CFS and their menu has been condensed significantly since I last visited a Mimi's years ago. With that being said, I didn't get the \"greasy spoon\" kind of breakfast experience I was looking for. I can only describe Mimi's as \"upscale affordability.\" I felt sort of underdressed in my T-Shirt and cargo shorts, but the prices were in line with what you would expect to pay at a \"traditional\" breakfast establishment.   I got pancakes, with two eggs and sausage. It didn't come with potatoes, rather a cup of fresh fruit (grapes, melon and strawberries). To be honest, I didn't miss the potatoes and the fruit was a nice compliment to the other items. The portion size is not going to make your jaw drop, but they don't short change you either. The coffee was better than your average restaurant coffee and could rival many coffee shops. The pancakes were fluffy, yet hearty and thick. Best pancakes I've had in a long time, and I've had plenty of them.  The parking lot was full and the place was packed, but the service did not suffer. Our waitress, Dawn, was friendly and efficient and kept the drinks filled throughout the meal. Mimi's was definitely much more than a \"cafe\"."}
{"text":"First of all i don't like to wait longer than 20 minutes from the time i order my food to the time i receive it. This is what happened at this Mimi's that me and my wife went to on a Thursday night during our first month here in Arizona. It had a New Orleans vibe to it...and happy hour was taking place when we arrived...but the food and service was just average. I can't even remember what i had at the time because they took so long to bring it to me. I am not saying that all Mimi's are like this one but be aware my fellow yelpers when you go so you won't be disappointed as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the breakfast as it is the only meal i have had there, I am not a fan of the portions as I was left wanting more. An overall good dining experience though for the value..."}
{"text":"Five stars for a manager that went above and beyond. My husband and I went to Mimi's Cafe for Valentine's lunch and intended to use a coupon that was sent to us in a Valentine email from Mimi's. Upon presenting it we were told it was not valid on Feb 14th. We put the coupon aside and enjoyed a lovely lunch. Always good food at Mimi's. As we were finishing our meal a manager came by and asked how everything was. My husband told her it's a bad idea to send a coupon in an email promoting a holiday when the coupon can't be used on that day, and he asked her to pass that on to Mimi's corporate offices. We didn't expect it but she honored our coupon and we left with two complimentary muffins."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend last night. Very attentive service, which was a plus. We got the three course special for $12.99 which was not a bad deal for the price. The french onion soup was very good. The chicken and artichoke spaghettini was solid: the chicken was excellent, the sauce was a little bland though and I had to kick it up with some hot sauce. The dessert (a chocolate mousse with strawberries) was excellent. Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"Man I used to love this place when it it was a quaint, affordable Cajun place with snazzy music and really interest atmosphere.  But over the years, the music changed, the decorations got taken down, and the menu went from awesome to not so impressive.  The food is also French or something Nus dye to the new changes to the menu.  Even with a BOGO coupon, it wasn't worth it to eat at the current Mimis Cafe.  The only saving grace its the fantastical carrot raisin loaf and clam chowder Fridays."}
{"text":"We were both hungry for turkey dinner and have had it before at Mimi's. Tonight it was horrible and very very salty. The broccoli was tasteless and my food was swimming in water and salty gravy. The only good part of the meal was the bread. After I have read other reviews and now eating there I am a bit afraid to go back.  I have terrible heartburn and stomachache."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it's always great.  I like the atmosphere and the menu.  The service is rea responsive and always comes by with water and tea to fill."}
{"text":"At Mimis I ordered the artichoke spinach dip that was good but the new mushroom & brie burger was not that great it lacked flavor, not impressed. Price was expensive for half a burger."}
{"text":"Breakfast here has its ups and downs... it's nice cause you get seated quickly but the food it's self is subpar. The baked goods are delicious but I've had issue with entrees. Farm house tacos have really dry tortillas.  The potatoes are super plain. The service today was horrible... usually we have really good service but today that was not the case. The man taking our order seemed like he was in such a rush. He practically threw the plate at our 5 year-old to the point where the food slid off onto the table. Just ridiculous! I Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place but it's gone downhill! The server was quite nice, and it wasn't her fault because she was working really hard. But our wait time get our food was unacceptable. The eggs were over cooked and when the second ones came out they were yellow from all the grease! It was our 2nd time in about 2 weeks and both times were bad. Unfortunately there won't be a third. The servers definitely need more help!"}
{"text":"I usually like this place, but on this visit I was a little unsatisfied with the service. The waiter spoke very softly and could not understand him, then he brought me the wrong order and during our meal a different waitress came to refill my drink and left the pitcher at our table which was a little odd."}
{"text":"My wife and I would go to the one near our old place every so often.  I know its a chain restaurant , but on occasion they have a meal that just has some great flavor , so why not.   We have been to this particular restaurant , and both times H O R R I B L E service.  The first time , we did not get our soup or salad , and the waitress was very few and far between on the drink refills.  Anyone that knows me , knows i suck down iced tea like its going out of style.  Sometimes i even have them bring me 2 glasses of it.    I think i got 1 refill the entire time.... needless to say there was a drought .   2nd time it was gorgeous outside , so we decided to sit outside. .... BAD IDEA.  Same issue with the waitress ,  very little checking up on us.  She was not even the one who brought us our food.   On top of that , they charged me for 3 of the 2 for 15 dollar meals instead of just 2 .....  no apology , no discount , no free dessert ... no nothing.  Just a 15 minute wait to get it fixed. And on our way .    I have sent a correspondence to the corporate office , and it has been nearly a month and have not heard anything back.  Obviously they don't care about their clientele."}
{"text":"We used to like Mimi's but after poor take out service we will not be going back again. Whenever we call in the they always seem to get our order wrong, smaller portions compared to dining in, and customer service is rude. We are disappointed."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is so refreshing and comforting. The atmosphere is French café inspired and they stay true to the café theme by offering 'fancy' coffee in pretty glasses. My bf and I had the café latte and it was very good, if you like strong coffee I would give that a try.   We came here on a Saturday around 3pm and it was quite and very few people were there. Our very nice and friendly waiter was Brooklyn and he knew the menu like the back of his hand even when asked about dishes that were no longer on the menu. He was very good about filling our glasses and the food came out really fast.  Yelp says this place is American, but it's really French-American. They have many Americanized French dishes, which is good for picky children and grown men that hate anything they can't pronounce. I love my boyfriend, but he has the palate of a 7 year old. He had the Tillamook Mac 'n' Cheese, and the Hickory Bacon Cheddar Burger and he liked all of it, his only complaints were that the fries were not crispy and the burger was a little on the sweet side for his taste.   Their Tomato Basil Soup is the BEST tomato soup I have ever had, and I am not a fan of tomatoes. It is quite thick but it complimented the 5 cheese grilled cheese sandwich I had, which is no longer on the menu but our waiter Brooklyn had them make it anyways, which was awesome 'cause I was really in the mood for a grilled cheese!  I give it 4 stars and not five because I really wish they would offer their ENTIRE breakfast menu all day. Instead, they only offer a few select items.   All in all, Mimi's Cafe is a warm, inviting, family oriented restaurant. Their portions are perfect, their food is pricey but high quality. Waiters are pleasant and helpful, and the wait is never long if there is even a wait at all. Definitely one of my favorite brunch places, will be coming back soon for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"The service was great. There was a 20 minute wait so we went to the bar area to skip it. The food didn't have a lot of flavor to it. The French onion soup tasted like water. I got an iced mocha. It came in a fancy glass. It was really pretty, it basically tasted like milk though. I will have to try again. My first experience was not the greatest."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the quality of the food! Not all that good, service is slow compared to other cafes, and I don't see why it is always as loud as it is. Don't really want to come Back here, especially after changing the menu once and the bread they gave was rock hard. Not a fan at all."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe did in fact update their menu to include a more French aspect. Is this bad? Not at all. Their dinner menu used to be filled with non-exciting and bland American dishes such as a tasteless pot roast that was drowning in gravy and dry meatloaf that tasted like flavorless ground beef. The new menu is more adventurous, and it matches Mimi's decor and atmosphere.   Tonight, I feasted on Carbonara a la Mimi's with an appetizer of French Onion soup. Let's start with the soup - Meh. The cheese was melted and stringy, just the way I like it. The soup itself was a bit salty and had the consistency of gravy. I did like the small, toasted piece of baguette that was hiding under the cheese. All in all, I don't think I'll be ordering the French Onion soup any time soon.   The Carbonara a la Mimi's was tasty. It had thick chunks of prosciutto and a generous helping of peas. The sauce was mixed-in and wasn't too heavy, and the noodles were cooked al dente.  The entire meal was nothing to write home about, but with their updated and exciting menu, I'll definitely be back to try other French inspired cuisine!"}
{"text":"Can you say dirty.  I have gone there several times and every time I go there are glass dividers between the booths and they are filthy.  I look around and seriously it was crazy.  I said something to the girl up front but she was on the phone and didn't really care what I was saying.  I haven't been there for a couple of months.  I just felt the need to say something.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Went here last week with my husband and had a great experience. We were pleasantly greeted and seated within a reasonable amount of time. Good food and a personable and pleasant server. Because of that positive experience suggested to my out of town friend visiting that we go for a late breakfast. Girl at the hostess stand; Lexi had major attitude. It was a 30 min wait but we saw many empty tables so when I asked if they were short handed, she replied, no, again with attitude. We waited outside until we thought it was close to when we should be called. Arriving at the hostess stand, we saw our name was next on the list, but there was no hostess in sight to seat us and a steady flow of customers poured in the door who were not greeted, or acknowledged or placed on the waiting list. Lexi was taking an order on the phone a few feet away, but she never looked up or called anyone over to help her. Terrible!!  When she finally walked over 10 minutes later, we commented that there was nobody at the hostess stand to greet or seat people. She replied her job was a balance and she had other things to do. Really! A woman appeared who apparently was the manager. I believe her name was Alena. I told her Lexi had major attitude and wasn't professional and needed some guidance and training. She apologized and hustled at that point, but where was she before? We were seated and two servers; James and Pam treated us well. Other than the two of them, the staff seemed to have no energy and there were no systems in place to make this establishment and restaurant experience pleasant."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Mimi's Cafe, and I came for my mother's birthday dinner. Though most of the food was fine (aside from my overdone steak), the problem here is the atmosphere.   One one hand, there were many noisy customers. For some reason everyone was treating the place like their living room, talking loudly and showing videos on their phone with the sound cranked up.  The servers said nothing about this, which brings me to the second problem. While our waitress was pleasant, she was very rushed trying to manage all her tables. The other employees were busy complaining about the treatment from the managers, making the entire atmosphere tense. The managers also seemed lackadaisical, walking around calmly and yet not checking with customers or promptly answering the door.  The food was great, and maybe another location would offer a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really taken back by the experience I received here today.     Went in for an early Father's Day brunch.  Thought this would be the perfect spot.  Have been here before and our previous experience was exceptional. Our sever at the time had a lot to do with it. I know that now.  The wait was only about five minutes not bad at all.  The moment we entered our booth our table was sticky and there was syrup and chocolate sauce smeared on the booth.  I get it we have kids.  But, was this table even wiped down? Asked for a rag. At this point I wiped it. Waitress was unfriendly. Rushed us through our order. Did not Bring water to the table had to ask. When our drinks finally came. Only the adults got water. I guess even in the desert kids don't need water too. My water was half full as if picked up from another table and had something floating in it. And. The straws that come wrapped in paper were all wet. GROSS. Didn't say anything  afraid something would be done to my food. Food was ok.    I wanted to enjoy brunch with my family. This just put us off so much.  To the waitress, Thanks for ruining the star off our day.  I can only imagine how busy you may get.  NEVER felt like it's ok to not treat someone with respect and common courtesy.  Shame on you. You could have built the ticket up.  You assumed because we are minorities we would've cheap I guess.  No, I'm not pulling the race card. Observing from your other tables who where still there enjoying themselves before we got there and still there after we left.  She assumed we went for the $5 dollar mimosas. No. Kept clarifying that the kids breakfast did not come with side and drink was also extra.  But did not tell us about the specials and cut us off while ordering?! OK  AND WALKED AWAY. Uum....I was still talking I just paused to think.  I guess you were in a hurry. Lastly as I'm finishing up my food walks over and let's us know it's time to go. Haha. Said, I will get a box for your muffin and your check. If I was not with my kids and trying not to be consumed by your negative energy lady. I would have so many choice words to say to you. Karma will get you though.  Won't be back here again.  Last Note to my waitress last %50 percent of the bill. Not show boating but last waitress did so good. She is the reason we came back!  Big mistake on our part. Don't let your Assumptions get the best of you."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab breakfast or lunch anytime of day. I was here for a Sunday lunch date. The customer service was really nice. There's a variety of good eats. It was their authentic French onion soup that sealed the deal for me. I'd recommend Mimi's and will return."}
{"text":"Mimi's is an interesting little place, well chain restaurant. The are known for their humongous scrumptious muffins.  The one that I visited in Scottsdale on Shea was decked out in Mardi Gras decor, but I don't know if that was just because it was during the month of February or if it is normal for this locations to have a New Orleans vibe all of them time. Happy hour drinks are great at half price to check them out during their happy hour.  I ordered the pasta with shrimp and my husband had the fish and chips. The food is good but it is not stand on your head and do cartwheels great. The service was nice but painfully s-l-o-w. I wanted to run outta there after I paid my bill cause I waited 20 mins for it to be delivered to the table.  All of this and they were not even swamped with customers all I can say is that Thursday night may not be the night to go to Mimi's."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with the family. Good service the muffins were phenomenal. Loved it there definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We had lunch here after a great round of golf. Our server was Marci. She started out exuberant but became uninvolved at the end. We even had to ask other employees to help us find her.     The skewered shrimp were cooked with just salt and pepper but tasted good. The sides were cole slaw and potatoes augratin. The potato dish looked strange but tasted great with plenty of cheese and moist potatoes.  The coleslaw had too much mayo.  The liver was decent but well done.  It came with near raw bacon that took 3 attempts to cook right.  The fried onions and mushrooms were cooked perfectly.  The augratin potatoes were yummy.    We tried to order dessert but our server was MIA so long that we decided against it."}
{"text":"I really like this place for breakfast and brunch! I've never had lunch so I can't comment on that. They always have fresh coffee cake and coffee waiting at the door for you. The food was excellent. It is NOT healthy but soooo good. My mom loved it. I got the pancakes and they were soft and fluffy. Mom got salmon Benedict."}
{"text":"Wow! I was really impressed! I had never been to Mimi's Café before because the name had me envisioning porridge and gruel, LOL. Nothing could be farther from the truth. First, the bread basket was delicious. The baguette was soft and fresh. The butter was soft and spreadable unlike most places who give you a hard cold rock and expect you to be able to spread it. There was also, I believe a carrot cake, which I typically do not care for but; this was sweet, and moist, and delicious. I had the Mardi Gras omelette which was flavorful and the cheese was delicious. My husband had the steak and eggs. The steak was prepared to the correct temperature and had a delicious garlic butter on top. He had poached eggs which he really enjoyed. I also had the croissant with my omelette. The croissants are divine!!! I could go there and be happy eating a basket of croissants and nothing else, LOL! Don't let the antiquated name fool you, Mimi's is great!"}
{"text":"Muffins to die for! I dream of their bran muffins! Great salmon. Yummilicious onion soup. Comfort food like chicken pot pie and meat loaf. In fact, it's pretty much all comfort food no matter what it is...familiar, cozy. Nothing daring, nothing edgy. But it's all good!"}
{"text":"I have visited Mimi's twice with my family. The first time we stopped in for breakfast. Service was horrendous and the food was so so. 3 of the meals came out initially and the forth meal was delayed because it was left off of the order for the cooks.  We vowed to not return. Well we did and shame on us for not going with our first instinct. Service again was terrible. The food was good except for an order of Frits that did not get made. When the server finally returned we informed her and 15 minutes later an order of Frits showed up as we were finishing our meals.   We asked for our check as we ordered desert and again the server was awol from the dinning room. Another server took our check and cashed us out.   Very poor service."}
{"text":"Our server Hector was fantastic. We ordered farmhouse breakfast tacos- excellent. The new spinach Brie bacon omelette was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Just love this place. The food is always on point.  Our favorite server is, Danielle.  She knows what A+ service is!"}
{"text":"We picked Mimis because they are at least consistent, and after a long day on the road everyone in my party was tired and just wanted to eat and get to bed.  Low middle of the road consistent.  They are not big on Vegetarian items at Mimis and I just do not understand this.  I asked my server if there was a marinara sauce I could have on the Pasta and she said No right away.   I am so glad I am not intimidated by attitude.   I was pretty hungry after a long day of driving and was not satisfied with the only other \"vegetarian\" options of Salad. When she came back to take our order I said to her  \"don't you have a kids pasta sauce\"? You could see the penny drop and indeed she said there was a kids pasta sauce that did not have meat in it, and that I had confused her by using the term marinara.  So, I was able to have Pasta.   My friends had Onion Soup and both of them had intestinal issues later that night and thought perhaps something in the soup was bad or contaminated.  Our server was attentive.  The best thing at Mimis is that Carrot Raisin bread they bring before dinner.  Two stars because three says A-ok and its not, Mimis is just a low average eatery."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is great. Nice size portions, maybe a little too much food for me, but my husband loves it. We have gone here on several occasions with three young children. They always accomodate our large parties very quickly. Good children's menu. The place is nice, but not so nice that you feel like your kids can't make some noise. Love the french toast. Waitstaff is pleasant. Only complaint is that the tables are a bit close together, you feel a little like you are sitting on top of people. But, we have always gone during breakfast rush."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for over a year.  I have always received great service until 3/5/16.  I am not sure if they got a new cook or if Mim's is starting to precook food or use microwave food but my food was over cooked and dry like it had been nuked in the microwave.  My food was not hot, the waitress was not attentive, we started with one waitress and half way through she went to work the bar, then another waitress came she barely checked on us,  never asked if we needed refills or water and brought us cold dry muffins.  I will have to say I will pass on Mimi's for awhile.  Hopefully other folks experience will be better than mine.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Ordered the corn chowder and a club sandwich. Corn chowder was great but the bread on the club sandwich(wheat) did not taste good. The wife ordered eggs Benedict and they were very good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mimi's Cafe in Utah and this branch is just about the same quality.  The food is good...if you like comfort food.  :)  This visit I ordered only a cupcake and that was mediocre, but satisfying for the sugartermite.  :)  The help is very friendly and there is a general happy feeling that overcomes you upon entering the establishment."}
{"text":"Hello....just left Mimi's. Wasted 45 minutes of my life.  Got there...got seated. Got our coffee and water and placed our order and never saw anyone again.  Literally sat there for 35 minutes with empty coffee cups and no food.  Mimi's is definitely NOT What it used to be.  Maybe that is why they have 2.5 stars.   Waitress GIN had no apologies and sent Manager to \"deal\" with us. If you make a mistake... Own up to it and just tell me... People make mistakes. So the order  didn't go in....so be it... to error is human but to send your manager to deal with your screw up is silly and immature.  Fail."}
{"text":"Food was good as always. The service was a little less than expected we were left sitting waking on drinks food was brought out separately .my sister and daughter  s dishes coming out 10 mins after everyone's. When we wee done we wee left sitting waiting for to go boxes and a check during this time my sister my daughter and my mom all went to the bathroom separately. And the my other sister waited again for her to go box to be brought it was forgotten..the waitress didn't make clear to my mom that there was only turkey sausage not turkey bacon. But my daughter love her crepes with Nutella and strawberries."}
{"text":"Loved the $5 glass of Merlot tonight along with penne pasta with meatballs. Had coupon for free entree. Where else can you get a dinner with good wine for $30. The waitress was incredible. We both had the Atlantic grilled salmon and it was great the cheesecake is $7.19 but it's made in house and delicious. Try the jambalaya with shrimp delicious."}
{"text":"This review will be short and sweet. I promise!  I was able to have breakfast here with the guys as our weekend was coming to an end and it was pretty darn good. I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. YUM! Dennis ordered the Mardi Gras omelet with fruit and I swear the is the second time this weekend he had mardi gras something. The first was mardi gras pasta over at pappadeaux. Hmm I see a theme lol. JD ordered eggs and chicken sausage and let me just say I have never heard the word sausage sound as naughty as it did with these two around. Even our server Steven was blushing by the time we left.  All in the the service was good, the food was good and the company was awesome.  I will have to come back and try lunch or dinner one day soon."}
{"text":"Great food. Fantabulous service! Prompt kitchen. Meatloaf was delicious. Mashed potatoes and gravy were flavorful. Even ordered a molten cake togo! hands down my new neighborhood favorite. Ask fir Kirk's section. what a great waiter! I'm coming back now for sure!!!!  If you don't like friendly, professional service with a side of yummy food then this ain't your cup of tea."}
{"text":"I ordered some kind of breakfast omelet and it was just as it looked, delicious. There was hardly anyone there but the waitresses weren't quite on top of their game. I had to wait a little for my coffee refills and it took a minute to get the check."}
{"text":"Mimi's has \"enhanced\" their menu.  Loosely translated, they hired a new \"master\" chef and Katie decided to removed popular items (removing pancakes and leaving stuffed waffles).  Their website still has the old menu.  Today, Sunday, we were surprised to see only two couples ahead of us at 10:30 AM (normally, the restaurant waiting area is standing room only).  After seeing the slimmed down menu, we knew why it is was so empty and opted to dine elsewhere.  Later, I read online about the new menu. Let's sum up:  old menu, standing room only ... new menu, two couples ahead of us.  Seems like we are not the only disappointed patrons.   We will not be coming back unless the old menu comes back."}
{"text":"Went there with my friend. She had salmon which was delicious, but the garlic spinach it came with was luke warm at best and had no garlic taste whatsoever. I ordered a chicken breast salad with a side of fries. The waiter never wrote down that I ordered fries. The service was super slow at 2pm with hardly anybody in the place. Food tasted good, but the service won't have us coming back. Lots of other choices in the area. The only thing our waiter was quick with was the check."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for a week day dinner, arrived around 4:30pm and was seated immediately. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the bread basket was the highlight of the day. The wife got a burger with fries, average burger and fries were unimpressive. I ordered the meatloaf, very sad, it was from a can then heated on the grill, mashed potatoes were instant and the gravy was store shelf canned at best. The vegtables were mixed brocholi and carrots, they could not decide to serve them raw or cooked, so they just half cooked them, carrots were very rubbery. Thirty dollars for this dinner was a disgrace, we won't be going back to any Mimi's anytime soon."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place because we had a coupon. We haven't been here before. It was a nice place. The food was pretty good and the service was ok.   We can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here for breakfast!  The food is great but what makes it always a great experience is our awesome waitress Beverly.  Beverly, always provides excellent service! She is extremely friendly and Bianca is too!  We are regulars now and they always greet us with a smile, good food and exceptional service is why we love our Mimi's Cafe."}
{"text":"Just finished our lunch about 2 hours ago and I'm sick.   The food was mediocre to bad. So bland we didn't finish the meatball appetizer that tasted like they were frozen, nor my sante fe omelet    I literally had 3 bites of my omelet. It was bland and the guacamole on top was brown.   When the server asked why I didn't want a to go box. We told her the food was not good.  She asked if we wanted to speak to a manager. I just wasn't up for going through the motions so we declined.   Now. I sit here sick. Like food poisoning sick!!!  This is not good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and now I can confidently say it's not really worth the price.  The food is mediocre at best, with the exception of their muffins and other baked goods. I ordered their grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and avocado. It looked great, but the taste left much more to be desired.  I'm not sure if it's just the Diet Coke here, or if their soda machine is broken - but the past couple of times I've ordered a Diet Coke here it has tasted absolutely awful. I'm guessing their syrup to carbonated water ratio is off - and I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed. That or it wasn't cleaned properly. Regardless, it's awful.  The service is also kind of slow, even on days when they're not particularly busy. We were told we'd be seated in 5 minutes, but it actually took closer to 15. We came around noon and didn't leave until closer to 2. The people are all nice, but it certainly takes a while to get any service.  I don't think I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today. It was yummy! Those muffins are too tasty.  The server was very friendly but it did take a while to get our food.     We used a coupon that they sent to me by e-mail. If you sign up for their e-club they send nice coupons and offers."}
{"text":"I always love going to Mimi's café.  If you go for breakfast, you can look forward to those delicious warm muffins.  The service is always pretty fast and you don't fill up on liquids while waiting on your food.  The food quality and the prices are outstanding.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  If you pop in for lunch, the same deal, comfortable, fast service and you have your pick of either breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The last time I ate at a Mimi's cafe was probably somewhere around 1998.  Yup, it's been awhile.  When I went to visit some good friends in Arizona, I had the pleasure of eating breakfast here.  After walking in, I instantly forgot how charming it is with the mini chandelier lights and homey feel.  It almost felt like a restaurant you would see in the New Orleans section of Disneyland.  Here's what I ordered:  Potato Cake Eggs Benedict: Hickory-smoked bacon, spinach, tomatoes, poached eggs and Hollandaise. With fresh-cut fruit--  This was just delicious.  Eggs were cooked exactly how I like them-  poke them and all the yolk comes dripping out.  The potato cake was almost like a hash brown and was seasoned nicely.   The bacon, spinach and tomatoes were yummy too.   Lemon Poppyseed Muffin: Piping hot and fresh out of the oven, I loved how I could taste the tanginess of the lemon and feel the tiny crunch of poppy seeds as I took a few bites.    I think I'll definitely have to go to my own local Mimi's just for the muffins alone."}
{"text":"I love Mimi's Cafe for one simple reason. French Onion Soup! It always comes out hot and tasty. I generally order a bowl as my meal. I used to get the mini wedge before my soup but have stopped because the wedge of lettuce they bring out has been frozen with ice all over it the last 3 times.  The service is ok, but I for sure recommend paying with cash because not once but twice my credit card was compromised after eating at this location. I don't like how the server takes off with your card and you can't see what is going on. Also, the servers must need to meet some sort of requirement for foods purchased because they are always leaving certain things off the receipt to get you to buy muffins or dessert to be able to use the common $10 off any $30 meal coupon that comes in the paper.  Bottom line,  I love the French Onion Soup too much not to go here but I will always triple check my bill and always pay with cash."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great customer service. Our party ordered the spinach and egg crepes (average), peaches and cream pancakes (average), summer berry waffle with fresh cut strawberries and blueberries (very good), a croissant (excellent), and a Santa Fe omelette (fantastic). We also ordered 6 muffins to go. The blueberry are average, bran are excellent, pineapple are pretty good, carrot was good, and buttermilk was very good. The manager also gave us two muffins to take home because it was our first visit."}
{"text":"Food was OK, but the reason for the low rating was the service. My waiter was obviously overworked. It took 15 minutes for him to even come over to greet me, then another 10 just to get a salad. He never came over during the meal to check on me, then dropped off the check. I filled out one of those online surveys and put my contact info, but here i am two weeks later and no one has contacted me."}
{"text":"really gone downhill.  Menu changes were big mistakes.  Found out they use margarine instead of butter...yikes!!!  who does that in this day and age??   Nothing like a margarine filled muffin with margarine on top.  Healthy right?  NOT!  every meal we have is terrible last few times so we stopped going anymore.  not surprised the location on Arroyo crossing closed, this one is next I'm sure."}
{"text":"zero stars would be more appropriate.  I'm not surprised it closed at all. This was near our house and formerly our fav eatery. :this location killed our affair with mimi's.  Dirty, terrible food.  Bad all around.  Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, the fingers though are great!Prices are reasonable, if your in the area I'd say its a safe bet for a good meal."}
{"text":"I wish it wasn't so and maybe it was just a bad day for the server but it was the worst experience I've had at Mimi's and it is a shame because it is or was a great place at one time.  To be seated and have no silverware or napkins till after bread and appetizers is not good. Having to ask for them is even worse. Then not getting soda refills to the point where I had to carry my own glasses up to the front and have another employee fill them for me.  It is a shame that a server thinks they will have a small bill so they throw service out the window.  Be a server then serve people, if not....go be a greeter at Walmart"}
{"text":"Christin was wonderful, she keep her cool with customer that keep giving her a hard time. I felt bad just listening to them complaining about everything. I enjoyed my breakfast it was definitely delicious. Thank you for our great service. If you come here please ask for Christin. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is NOT a go-to restaurant for me..........it's average, run of the mill, and if someone suggests it, I attempt to persuade them in another direction.  There are however, a few items that my mouth waters for: ~MUFFINS........buttermilk spice, carrot raisin nut and their seasonal PUMPKIN hit the spot!  =) ~Bleu cheese and walnut salad ~French Quarter burger (but I can get this anywhere, really) ~Bread Pudding  I have real beef with this place.............WHY ON EARTH DID YOU DO AWAY WITH THE MEATLOAF SANDWICH?    Baaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh..........so pissed!  I LOVED that sandwich.  :(  The pancakes lack luster and their quiche isn't anything like my mom's.  Their attempt at French-American cuisine is mediocre and a waste of my time to be perfectly honest!  NEXT..............please!?!?"}
{"text":"Great service and good food at Mimi's. Waiter Willy was fantastic. Ask for him. We are at Mimi's in Boca Park. It is December 30,2017. We are dining at Mimi's once again. I love that they always have coupon. Monday and Wednesday evenings feature a buy one get one free for seniors. Calories are listed next to each menu item. I had delicious chicken crepes with a Honey mustard Chardonnay sauce, which was much lower . Today our waitress was Sarah!! She was great."}
{"text":"Don't come here for dinner, although the place was nice and cosy, the food was bad...bad...bad. We had the French onion soup, the cheese on top was very under baked and gluey, the soup itself was very slaty. I had the salmon dinner, the fish was ok, but the steam vegetable had no flavor, and the brown rice was soggy. My husband's dish was a little better than mine, but still, it's just not a place to go out for..."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for Brunch on a Sunday, wait was about 20mins. We were sat within that 20mins. The hostess even took our drink order and offered me a mimosa. Who doesn't drink mimosas with brunch?! The server greeted us promptly and took our order. I got the ham/cheese omelet with a blueberry muffin which came out first, very fresh and hot and SO delicious! My boyfriend got the orange creme French toast which was also amazing. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"I suppose I was expecting more...the muffins were definitely the exquisite high point of a otherwise ordinary breakfast...I may go back and get muffins or croissants \"to go\", but the so-so potatoes and eggs were just that: \"so-so\"....I need more flavor! Maybe the lunch and dinner options are better?!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I think our waiter forgot us. Didn't bring dressing for salad that came with hubby's dish until he was half done. And all we were drinking was water, and never a refill  Sloooow to give us our check!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Father's Day and was worried there would be a long wait, but was seated right away. Loved the atmosphere, it made me feel so relaxed. The place was clean and service was good. The food was amazing, I had the bacon avocado omelette and my mom had the quiche. We will be back, and next time we will try the muffins."}
{"text":"Fast seating. Quick ordering. Tryed to use a coupon but since it is Valentine's day they don't allow the bogo deal. Have a another coupon which doesn't say not good on special days of holidays but the manager said no coupons of any kind can be used. This will be my last time here"}
{"text":"VERDICT: Bring your own butter...better yet, bring your own food.  I don't get this restaurant at all.  What is it suppose to be?  A family restaurant?  A French restaurant?  A New Orleans restaurant?  Because it fails with all of that.  The menu consists of rather bland café fare.  There is Chicken Cordon Bleu on the menu.  Rather than actual Cordon Bleu, it is deep-fried chicken served with a bright yellow mustard sauce that they have the guts to call Dijon sauce.  The room we were in was decorated as if we were in a New Orleans café, ironically painted with the names of fun, Cajun dishes that were not on the menu.  I ended up getting the ravioli...I know, I know, how French is that?  The sauce would made Chef Boyardee seem gourmet and the ravioli seemed fresh from the freezer. We went with Greg's mother, who I refer to as the Dairy Queen.  She became absolutely disgusted that they didn't serve real butter with the bread.  It tasted as if it was Promise, a butter substitute.  She, after finishing with her unbridled disgust, decided to bring her own butter with her on any future trips to Mimi's Café.  I, on the other hand, was not offended by the butter substitute, but will not be returning to Mimi's ever again, with or without my own butter."}
{"text":"Mimi's is a great little lunch spot, a great dinner spot, but where it really shines is breakfast. They have great eggs benedict, breakfast sandwiches, all with a little bit of bistro charm.   Here's the only problem: Everyone else likes it! And they like to talk about how much they like it (or something else, perhaps) very loudly. It's a really \"bustling\" atmosphere. Which is to say, it's very loud in there. Not a place for a quiet date, that's for sure.  It's definitely not a quiet little french cafe, but it's work getting out of bed for to get breakfast..."}
{"text":"Went to Mimi's on Fort Apache and Charleston Blvd. on December 1, 2017 for lunch.  My wife ordered a tuna combination lunch and it was so soggy that the bottom half of the sandwich was stuck to the plate.  We complained to the waitress and all she said was \"OH\", not offering to replace the meal or get the manager.  My wife ate the tuna out of the sandwich and left the rest.  When we received the bill I asked for the manager because I was not happy at all.  Brenda, the manager, came over and said she would take 1/2 of the bill for my wife's meal.  I am also a veteran so I asked if they had a veteran discount as well.  She told me she could not give me both discounts so I would need to choose which one I wanted in a very sarcastic manner.  Now being upset, I told her the meal was not a discount but rather a very large inconvenience since my wife's meal was not eatable.  The manager then sighed very loud, turned and walked away shaking her head and making faces.  The manager then came back and handed me the bill stating she took my wife's meal off the bill and that is more than half, no kidding!  Then as we were walking out she looked at us and said \"happy holidays\" with a smirk on her face.  Needless to say, we will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I met a GF here for lunch today. Parking was easy... For the most part, but the construction on the streets makes it challenging to get in and out for now.   The hosted got us in right away. I didn't particularly like the big booths in the main dining area so I asked if we could sit in the sun room area. Even though it was closed off, she accommodated us! I loved that!   Our server came over right away and for our drink order. When se came back we were ready to order. I had this amazing crusted and breaded chicken cordon blue sandwich and my GF Got a salad. I don't remember what kind because my face was buried so far into the delicious sandwich.... I was paying attention!   I give them 4 stars because the table... Even though set for new patrons.... Was disgusting and dirty. My seat had food and crumbs on it and was not whipped down. They accommodated my seating request, but should never have put the place settings without actually cleaning the table.   Everything else was spot on... I would go again in a heart beat... I'll just check the table next time before I sit down.... Lol!"}
{"text":"I must say I had the best service here. Our server shambray was amazing, very attentive and out going. We were seated right away and she came right up after introduced herself and gave us a min to decide what we wanted to drink. Through out our time there we never had to ask for a refill and she kept checking on us. It's hard to get pleasant service like that nowadays and I will not give 5 stars unless my experience was amazing. I would definitely go back just because of the service. Now on to the food. I had ordered a turkey dinner which was tender and great in taste. My partner on the other hand ordered a pot roast dinner thst he was thrilled with. Great experience and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not what it used to be.  Ordered French onion soup. I never received it. Ordered steak medium, brought home to dogs since it was over well black char. Had to ask for bread basket. Waitress was nice but probably one of the slowest I've ever encountered but hey we all have our \"off\" days.  Bummer mimi's used to be delish now you're lucky to get half your order."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, try the steak and eggs, the waffles and chicken or a \"grand\" combo.  The corned beef hash and eggs is also good.  Orange juice is an acquired taste."}
{"text":"I used to eat here at least once a week.  But something has happened.  The food is old and tastes reheated like five times.  The service is sometimes good and sometimes bad."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL French beef stew (got mine without mushrooms). They're always super friendly and the service is always great. The food always comes out hot, never just warm or cooled.  I don't think that tortilla chips with spinach dip go well good together. They used to offer sliced bread instead of chips... and the cheese on this appetizer seems to have been reduced.  But it's still good.  Love their corn chowder soup!  Usually get a bowl to take home.  So good!"}
{"text":"This did not start out well.  I showed up for breakfast only to find I had to cool my heels in the parking lot until they opened at 7.  And they actually opened at 7:04.  And even then they really were not ready to serve customers.  I got my coffee fairly quick, then my orange juice, then my bread (muffin) and finally about 7:30 my breakfast entree.  The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.  The food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.  Being a little more expensive than some other breakfast spots I expected more taste.  That and being late/slow cost it a half star and in this case I chose to round down."}
{"text":"We love Mimi's! Never thought about writing a review. I am a creature of habit and for breakfast I always get the Santa Fe Omelet. Truly my favorite breakfast dish. Well yesterday the restaurant was out of avocado's so I decided to choose another dish. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Truly surprised that it was so good. It wasn't like frozen chicken. The waitress told us that it is hand breaded and I could tell. Super yummy loved it"}
{"text":"Jamie our waitress is so sweet and attentive, be sure and ask for her. Stopped in for Lunch and ordered the half sandwich and soup. Chicken Cordon Bleu with Corn Chowder (Soup was nice and Hot, that is important to me). Portions were just right, not real large. Fries were homemade and done perfectly. The establishment is very clean and decorated like a french cafe, the front looks like a Bistro. $5 a glass house wine from Palm Bay is a super buy"}
{"text":"1 star but really deserves NONE- worst customer service/food ever. Got seated and waited 10 min for someone to even acknowledge that we were seated and come get our drink order. When the young girl (Brooke) came up she didn't even apologize for the wait. Made a sarcastic comment about how we looked like we were ready to order. She took our order, never brought us bread when she took some to all her other tables, brought us our food. the order was wrong. Took her another 10 min to bring out correct items (not even the main course, sides), she did not apologize. Never came back to check on us. We noticed that she stood behind the counter a lot pretending to be busy. brought us our bill and did not even thank us or anything. never go here, or if you do... make sure you do not sit in brookes section. to top it all off the sandwiches we got were very bad, should not even have sent these items out the way they looked. Pretty disappointed seeing that Mimi's used to be one of my fav places to go."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is a great breakfast place, and they serve it all day.  The prices over the years however have climbed.  And this particular location suffers from close proximity to the Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino (see separate review).    However, if I am in the mood for breakfast and it is already in the afternoon, this is a good place.  The muffins are too too good and huge.  The eggs are passable, and the service is good.  The ambiance is also cute."}
{"text":"I've been to Mimis a few times and I have to say that they are fairly inconsistent.  Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad.  It seems as though breakfast is usually pretty good, but dinner seems to be lacking most of the time.  I went this past weekend for dinner.  I got the three course steak meal for $9.99.  I know, I should have known better, but I couldn't resist.  The salad was ok.  Then came the steak with mashed potatoes.  The steak was terrible.  It definitely had fake chargrilled marks on it.  Then came the \"sundae\" to finish off the meal, which turned out to be a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup on it.    Again, I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe has stepped up its game in recent years. Though I dearly miss the days when meals came with custard cups I can still say they make a great french onion soup. Menu changes have been the norm these past few years but I say they got it right. Good dependable sandwiches and soups at a minimum, with tasty burgers and main entrees that remind me of grandma style comfort food if a fancy cold cut sandwich or french dip must be forgone. I also enjoy the service here. The individuals i have interacted with have been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We walked in and waited for someone to come and seat us. Then we were finally seated with no help until moments later when I had to give a waitress a look, thankfully she took the hint. They got a waiter Sy, he def changed the experience around to an enjoyable one! With his sense of humor and outgoing fun personality helped us out in a giffy! Thanks so much sy!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was just ok.  The freshly baked bran muffin was bitter.  The lorraine quiche was bland but the potatoes was very good.  The freshly squeezed OJ was super bitter, after adding 1 packet of sugar still no go."}
{"text":"After years of driving by Mimi's (usually in Albuquerque, NM), we finally stopped for lunch at the location on Bell in Glendale, AZ. I wish we would have long before. I ordered the Quiche Florentine and my husband had the Chicken Parmigiana. Wow, were we both pleasantly surprised! We were pleased with the speed of service (we went at lunchtime), the food was fantastic, and the atmosphere is very cozy and clean. The prices seemed to be pretty typical. The portions were quite large.  We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Quiche Florentine was divine, buttermilk spice muffin was delicious, and service was spectacular. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"So I came here the other day with my mother in law because I had a buy one get one free coupon and have been wanting to try this place out for a while now i hadn't been here in over 10 years.   This was a tuff one to rate because I wanted to give it 4 stars but service is a big part of my critique and that was a miss big time! let me start from the beginning.  So we walk in and notice its pretty busy the hostess writes down my name and says its gonna be a 5 minute wait well 10 minutes pass and we still haven't been called and we notice people who have came in after us are getting seated before us so i go up to the hostess (who is a different guy this time) and ask him when were going to be called he looks for my name but its not written down so we tell him we had been waiting there a while,I told him the other hostess supposedly wrote our names down and he said we would be sat next well we weren't anyways to make a long story store we finally got sat! Apparently being a hostess at Mimis is rocket science and these guys failed.   Ok moving on the waitress was very friendly approaches us right away we both wanted a mimosa and the waitress suggested we do the mimosa flight which was only 25 cents more I believe and included a bottle of  champagne (each) and 3 different glasses to mix it with strawberry lemonade, orange juice, or cranberry we ordered it why not for only 25 cents more! We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer they were good not great but good my moms recipe is way better. I ordered the french toast with eggs and sausage the french toast wasn't anything special and the eggs  were actually brown on the bottom they were burnt! the sausage was good though. My mother in law ordered an omelet which came with a pumpkin muffin she said the muffin was ok and the omelet was good.   Now onto the service I wasn't impressed with the service its as if we were forgotten about once she set down the food I don't recall her returning until she dropped the check off (which luckily for her I didn't mind it because I was having a good conversation with my mother in law and enjoying being out... fyi I use to be a server I know what good and bad service is she wasn't that great so between her, the hostess and the \"ok\" food I'm giving this place 3 stars. I truly enjoyed my time here though only because of the great company and mimosas."}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated my son's 23rd birthday tonight. There were five of us in our group. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately. Our waiter Todd, let us know he would be with us in a few minutes as he was bringing food out to other tables.  We reviewed the menu and decided what we wanted to order. Todd took our drink order; he was quick to bring them right out to us. He took our order and was informative as well on using a coupon for the buy one entree with two drinks and get one entree free. While we waited for our food, he brought out warm, fresh breads with butter for us to snack on. Our meals followed shortly thereafter: Mushroom brie burger with a fresh garden salad, bacon cheeseburger and fries, corn chowder, grilled chicken Caesar salad and bacon, avocado burger on sourdough with fries.  Everything was delightful, fresh, hot, tasty and delicious.  We were a hungry bunch, so we began immediately eating our meals and did little talking.  Todd was excellent, he was cordial, helpful and caring. He made sure our drinks were always filled and he cleared away our dishes quickly. He brought out a nice piece of birthday cake for my son with a lit candle in it and along with us, and others seated in the restaurant, we sang \"Happy Birthday\" to my son. Todd helped make it special and he should be recognized. Mimi's Cafe is a really neat restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"Initial greeting and service today great, then my waitress was moved to another part of restaurant. After that I was totally and repeatedly ignored even though waitress remaining in my section seated ppl right next to me and I tried to get her attention to get more coffee and order to go.  Doubt I will return for similar treatment.!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a French version of Denny's This place is a French version of Olive Garden's  There was alot of people packed here for Sunday Morning so they must be doing something right. I liked the decor and the overall friendliness of everyone. They told us 20 minute wait but we got inside in 10 minutes. Sweet. Their breakfast menu is different from the rest of their regular menu so expect that.   Ordered Kiche just because you can't just get that anywhere and also the process to cook it takes a while and i know is a little difficult. Anyway didn't like it too much.   I recommend the Eggs Florentine Breakfast.  Now that was delicious. Sampling other people's food :)   You know, now that i think of it, I ordered the 4 cheese( quatre) Kiche and it was ok. The chedder and broccoli kiche tasted better.   Go try some French food. Go to Mimi's."}
{"text":"Nothing to see here folks--The food was not bad, the ingredients were fine but no flavor that leaves you with a za za zoom.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda.  $2.50 for a soda?  The total for this lunch was $15.  Now I remember why I don't come here for lunch, for the money, there are a lot better choices.  The upbeat music does not account for the $4 difference between this place and many others.  Service was friendly, but I don't think I'll be back.. anytime soon or until I forget why I stopped in the first place."}
{"text":"Undercooked cornbeef hash under good eggs Benedict.  Approximately 15 pieces of potatoes for 12 bucks. They seem to have forgotten my hot chocolate for the whip cream was half melted when it came out 10 minutes later. Actually it came out the same time as the food. My freind had the farmhouse tacos which were humongous but balnd. His meal was twice the size and 10 cents less. Just because I don't like bad quality with over pricing I gave this business 3 stars.  The server was distant at first 5 minutes to recognize us and approach  (section wasn't busy), but then kinda warmed up. Orerdered a side of fries ( I like to try everyones fries) that came out greasy. Someone needs to have a staff meeting."}
{"text":"Ordered the Eggs Benedict for brunch, it's very good and filling. You order breakfast almost all day on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I'm on the fence about this place...  On one hand, they send some pretty great offers through their email mailing list. Things like 'Buy One Entree & 2 Drinks, Get Another Entree (of Equal or Lesser Value) for FREE' which happens to apply to breakfast, lunch, OR dinner. It's a great deal for a quick date! The things you can pick from on the menu aren't half bad either. I ordered their Premium Soup + Sandwich combo, or a cup of French Onion + a West Coast Rueben w/ a side of fries, which was pretty satisfying! My mom and I were both able to eat for about $20. Not bad!  On the other hand, the service we received was pretty disappointing... We were seated quickly, but everything after that felt entirely too rushed & almost like we were annoying our waitress. It was hard to get her attention. Also, the women's restroom was ATROCIOUS. There was literal sh*t on the walls, along with no toilet paper in two of the stalls... It was hardly busy that day, so there's no excuse."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good.   It was very slow for as busy as they were.   The main reason for 3 over four stars, is they propose somewhat of a value dinner but then don't put a price for drinks on the menu. When the drink with tax for plane ice tea with lemon that wasn't very good is 30% the cost of the mean no thanks. I won't be back just over the coveting of this up."}
{"text":"Very Nice and  Cozy Restaurant,  first time yesterday! 1/12/14 Sunday,  excellent service,  we ordered the Le Grande breakfast with pancakes, and a Tuna Sandwich,  beautiful Bread nicely Grilled,  but the filling,  Tuna Filling didn't have any taste whatsoever,  I told the waitress and she let the cook know about it,  but didn't I'm sorry,  I will take it back,  can I offer you something different,  I wasn't expecting a discount or anything,  but as a business owner,  I want to keep my customer coming back over and over again, so I would have handled it different by not charging that specific Entrée,  or some kind of coupon for next time.  But they probably think they're too good to go the extra mile for a customer,  will I be back?  Sure I will try something different,  I'm a Restaurant owner so,  Mondays we always look to try different kinds of Food.   NEXT..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mimi's off and on for almost 30 years. In Vegas for the past 9 years I have been into this location a few times. I have always liked the food. I am taking time to write this review of a breakfast I had there recently.  Simple really. I ordered their Eggs Benedict and the poached egg did not have a runny yolk. Either it sat in the window too long or it was overcooked. When I brought it to the attention of the server, she did nothing to make it right"}
{"text":"Good food and service at a reasonable price. I've been to several Mimi's Cafe locations in California and Arizona and it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"My grandmother in law requested this place for her anniversary dinner. We had a party of 7 including my one year old son. We were seated and had to ask again for a high chair which they finally brought over covered in brown stuff which was hopefully food. As the host placed it down we mentioned how filthy it was he pretended not to hear and walk away. The check from the pervious party was still on the table and you could tell the table hadn't been wiped down. When we placed the order the waitress walked off before we could order for our son ( which but the way they don't really have healthy options for children anyway, a fruit bowl, or broccoli otherwise it was all junk). We were completely rushed thru dinner ( 6 pm on a Thursday), the waitress even asked if my boyfriend was going to finish his steak or if she could take his plate.. I can't say we will recommend or return"}
{"text":"Mimi sampler is a good appetizer.  The zucchini is cut the long way, for a good zucchini flavor over the breading.   I enjoy the Chicken Cordon Bleu, as it tastes fresh, and well cooked.  In retrospect this meal was heavy on the fried side, so I will search for a different combination next time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast at Mimi's. I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes. Delicious, nice portion and totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"What can I say...I like it. When friends are saying Ihop or even worse, Dennys; thien this place is a Godsend for breakfast. Mimis is like Ihops VIP room."}
{"text":"As I mention in my previous review we wind up at Mimi's frequently because it is so close to home. Today we had a BOGO offer and my partner wanted to go out for breakfast.  So off to Mimi's we went.  We were greeted quickly and our orders were taken right away. Since the restaurant was not that busy the food came quickly too. Too bad the food wasn't that great. My omelette had no flavor. Luckily my partner's waffle was good according to him.  In addition to really not getting my order right and not bringing the water we asked for they have slipped to two stars.   Luckily for them they are the only game in Desert Ridge unless you consider Tryst Cafe and their misleading, overpriced menus an option. Pass on both and drive down the road to Butter's or Butterfield's in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this gem.  The food is comparable to your grandmother's good old home cooking.  Michelle the server could not be nicer or more knowledgeable...and very sweet.  Omar  the manager is sincerely one of the best managers in Vegas. He stopped by and chatted with myself and my husband for quite a while.   Such an amazing place all around.  You are missing out if you don't go"}
{"text":"My daughter just moved in the area and we were looking for a place to eat. Used to eat at Mimi's all the time but found that the quality had gone done considerably so we stopped going. Thought we'd give it a try. Asked for my steak to be medium. Came out well done and dry. Very disappinting. Daughter enjoyed her potpie and we both enjoyed the artichoke frites. My daughter who used to be a server thought the service was sub par. He showed no personality and our beverages were empty for quite a bit while he was rolling silverware."}
{"text":"Food was fair.  my husband loved his \"french\" beef stew.  I dislike grilled asparagus for a reason, they taste burnt!  His mashed potatoes were very good.   My steak was  very big, juicy not too tough, but not really great.  I would not eat steak here again.   The server said their signature dish was \"cobb salad\".    The coupon we had for dinner was  2 for 1 However, you had to buy drinks.   Two iced teas $5.20!   Also had soup which didn't come with dinner but only 1.99 each.   Very good broccoli cheddar and onion soup.    Total $26 after free dinner (12.99)   Not sure if I would go again unless I had a free breakfast.     The traffic is horrible here we had to go down to the next block and turn around.      I'm very picky but the service was fine, the server very nice.    The atmosphere was casual not too noisy.      The couple at the next table only ordered desserts.   They had bread pudding with a great big whip cream and some sort of open muffin or tart with whip cream.   It was over $10.    I wasn't able to eat the bread basket which was two rolls, two pieces of lemon poppy \"bread\" and two pieces of something else.    Took that home with the leftover steak and stew.    For some reason or other the server did  not give me the potatoes that came with my meal, but asked me after it was served if I wanted it. .. Does that make sense?   If you want to try here, do so.    I don't think it was the greatest,  but it certainly wasn't the worst."}
{"text":"The service and the breakfast was fantastic but cleanliness in the restrooms was really bad!!!! You could tell it is not cleaned very often! Take a look at my photos!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Mimi's? It's a Great place. I just can't ever decide what I want off the menu, they all look so YUMMY. Make sure you sign up for their e-mail and you'll get a free 4 pack of muffins to go, when you're done. Can't leave without the heavenly chocolate ganache goodness! We usually go for brunch so the breakfast and lunch menu's seem a perfect fit, and the little kiddo's get free snacks while they wait for their meal. A pretty simple gesture that pleased this mommy."}
{"text":"Friendly, spacious, beautiful Café. Pumpkin muffin & homemade corned beef hash amazing!  Go!"}
{"text":"I went to Mimi's for breakfast/brunch and was diappointed.  The food was ok and the prices were a bit on the high side.  Service was decent but my expectations for this place were high and I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place but I heard soo many bad reviews in the past that I NEVER gave it a real chance...i had a bogo coupon that I guess they are using to regain more costumers, but hey it worked because it loured me in! LOL....so here it goes...the ambiance was overall inviting, surprisingly very classy I wasn't expecting that. They had a variety of mimosas to choose from, I had the peach and it was delish! I ordered the Turkey bacon mushroom crepe that I subsituted the Turkey for ham because I just love salty pork substances for breakfast lol...the crepe was fantastic! The only critique I have is the huge slab of cheese on top, a crepe should be light and dainty perhaps shred the cheese and sprinkle it on top it makes for a better presentation   Being from NY, My husband always judges a restaurant on how good or bad their coffee is; and he actually enjoyed their brew, he also tried their banana foster waffles and it was a slam dunk! This Place is also extremely kid friendly they had puppy dog shaped pancakes and the staff was kind enough to even give the kids a complimentary snack as they waited for their food.   Our waitress Felicia was very sweet and knowledge of the contents of the menu she even made great suggestions for me prior to ordering and I love that! We left with some complimentary muffins that look scrumptious can't wait to devour those bad boys.  With the coupon this place was still a bit pricey  7 bucks for a side of 4 sausage links is a bit much BUT ....would I come back here? The answer is YES! The general staff was very attentive, the food tasted fresh, they have great promotions and they are kid friendly...u guys did great, thanks Felicia!"}
{"text":"We were here last year for Thanksgiving and since we were in the area again- we're back for more!  Can't beat the Turkey Day deal- $14.99 for turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mashed, sweet potato mashed, a soup or salad, bread and dessert.   We forgot to get reservations but still only wanted for about 20 minutes.   Sir Scootie the 18 month old Wonder Baby was ready to leave about 40 minutes into our dining experience so to keep the joy of the holiday afloat, we got everything to go at that point. Our server was good- she even brought out a kids tray- to try and calm big boy down- an orange slice, a cup of cheerios and some grapes. Super cute.   Finally, everyone- all the servers, bus people, etc seemed to help keep things moving out of the kitchen on a very busy day for them. Having worked in food service, I really appreciate it when all hands are on deck."}
{"text":"Food off the new, slimmed-down menu reflects a more authentic bistro experience. Boulliabaise, Crêpes, Coq au Vin are all good choices. Spring for a cup of French Onion Soup or the seasonal Pumpkin Bisque. If the weather is nice, ask to eat on the patio. A good choice for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming to Mimi's since we were kids and we were surprised that we found one here in Vegas. Sadly the service was very slow. Every time we needed to have our drinks refilled the waitress would take a long time to get them. Standing at the bar chatting with the bar tender. The food came out slow and it was poorly made and very bland. Also the couple a cross from us were Not having a good experience with the same server. Not the experience I remember coming here as a kid. Sad to say but we won't be coming back to this Mimi's."}
{"text":"Apparently I should try this place for breakfast (based on reviews), because for lunch/dinner it just isn't my type of restaurant. The menu choices are fairly extensive, but to me it's a close relative of a Jason's Deli-type joint, but with higher prices.   The service has never been fantastic - though to be fair, it's never been terrible...so I guess right in line with my 2 star rating. My girlfriend was on a kick of liking this place for a while, and I suffered through it a few times for her sake, but luckily I've been able to avoid it recently.   Perhaps we'll go for breakfast, after which I will gladly eat my words (and change my review) if it's significantly better."}
{"text":"We just ordered to go lunch and ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad and there in literally 11 tiny pieces of chicken on the salad. We wont order to go from here again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.    The service was pretty bad.  My friend and I went, this was both our first times to Mimi's Cafe, and we both agree that the food which is made to order is very good. We also agree the service is just above atrocious.  We went on a Sunday night right at dinner time about 5:30-6, somewhere in there...there were MAYBE six tables eating at the time and that's being generous.  The hostess seemed a bit flustered and I am not even sure why, there were only two parties waiting. She called our name but said no the other party, which is fine they were here first. I am not sure how you get that mixed up especially when she was looking right at us, then she said she said another name.  My friend and I both heard her quite clearly.  We waited a ridiculous ten minutes for a table. If they were busy that would have been one thing.  Were they that understaffed? In that instance you need to give a heads up, I hadn't planned on it being a two hour affair.  It took a very long time for a server to come to our table to get our drinks. We asked for extra time to decide an appetizer because they all sounded  great and we were trying to decide what we wanted for dinner and what would be best. When she did come back we ordered our appetizer and she stood there looking at us.  I had to ask her if she was ready for our dinner order.  Shouldn't she have asked us if we were ready to order rather than standing there awkwardly not saying anything? She took plates away that we still wanted, she didn't ask if we still wanted them. Yes, there is still bread and butter on the plate, what were you thinking, woman? We had to ask the hostess for more butter since ours was taken without our permission and our server must have entered the witness protection program at that point. My server forgot my water, which is not a big deal I still had my wine. She asked if we needed anything and I just said I'd like a water please, she said I knew I forgot something.  If you knew you forgot something why didn't you come to our table to ask what you forgot? I got a dessert and the check. She ran my card dropped it off and then I saw her LEAVE. I thought maybe a smoke break...I still needed her...she still had a table...US! She didn't know how I much I tipped her, she was NOT done.  If she was on a smoke break it was an inappropriate time to do that when a table is finishing up. I had to go chase down another server for to go boxes.  If she had an emergency another server should have told us that the server had to leave. I worked in restaurants for 25 years. I know good service from bad. Never in my life have I taken tip away.  The place was not busy.  I left 20% at first. When I saw her leave without checking if we needed anything else first, I took $2.00 away and adjusted the tip. In hindsight I wish I had not tipped at all.  I will go to Mimi's Cafe again but not this location. Hopefully others are run a bit better with better service. I can handle sub standard service...no introductions, no smiling as long as you are timely but I can't handle sub sub sub standard service which is what I got. Our server was not rude but lacked any kind of personality. We all have bad days at work but it seemed that the service in general, hostess included was just plain bad."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Only 3 stars because the service was the worse ever. Restaurant was almost empty and it took over 10 minutes to be seated. Then a gentleman who was just coming on duty asked if we had been helped. He seated us and we were then forgotten. 10 minutes later a waitress came to the table, asked if we had been helped, apologized and said she would bring back bread. Another 10 minutes goes by. She brought the table behind us their check, remembered the bread she had promised and finally went and got the bread. Our order was finally taken. The appetizer, the Meyer lemon mussels were awesome, but she had to be asked for the appetizer again after another 10 to 15 minutes had come and gone. I had added dessert to go when she brought the bill. Long story short, she was getting off of her shift and told us she needed the signed receipt before she left. She was obviously in a hurry, which I understand and don't have a problem with. The biggest problem I had was she gave me the wrong dessert to go which I did not realize until we were leaving and I saw what the dessert was supposed to look like.  Great food but with such HORRIBLE service great food will only take you so far. Will try again for breakfast to see if there is an improvement with the day shift servers. My daughter is a server and I tend to give servers a break but this was ridiculous. The 3 servers who were on duty spent more time standing by where the computer is located than making sure customers were seated or needed anything."}
{"text":"Yuck!   I ordered Chicken Piccata (which comes with mashed potatoes and vegetables). It tasted like a microwavable dinner removed from the box and put on a plate. The vegetables were a joke.   My friend ordered a Chopped Cobb salad, which was clearly pre-made since the bowl and fork that came with it was ice-cold. A pre-made salad would typically be fine, except the iceberg lettuce was brown-ish and the fresh tomatoes were so mushy it looked like salsa.   Sadly, the only thing that was good here was the carrot cake they provided in the bread basket. This is a place I will definitely not re-visit."}
{"text":"I love the muffins, the soup and salad deal is good and the choices and combinations are just enough! The atmosphere is relax and the music is inviting, food portions are just right and the choices plenty but not overwhelming! I would have given this place a 5 star but unfortunately the service was less then great while my waitress was polite you could tell she would rather be somewhere else.  Over all good but room for improvement I will definitely be back and I'm sure it will be better!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast since the wait was a lot shorter than Babystacks. I wish we had waited :(  I ordered the New York strip steak and eggs while my hubby ordered the cinnamon roll French toast. His French toast was delicious but that's pretty hard to mess up. Especially when it's made of cinnamon rolls haha.  Service was excellent.  My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare but I ate less than half of it because it was mostly gristle and fat. I could barely saw through it with the steak knife. Otherwise the eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were delicious. For $19 those were pretty expensive eggs and potatoes. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Other than excellent service, the food is really anything to write home about. On par with other breakfast places but gets four stars or it's fantastic service"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous and affordable. Quality ingredients, hot and fresh. Great service and atmosphere. Love coming here and the Cobb salad, chicken pot pie, chicken is always great. Ms.Jessica was my server and she did a great job. This place is our family weekend tradition."}
{"text":"Not pleased with how my meal was served.  They ran out of dinnerware, and glasses.  My soda with dinner was served in very small glasses (practically shot glasses) and my cup of soup was served in a bowl half filled as if someone had eaten half of it, very odd!!  The wait for refills, napkins and everyone just rushing by as if being avoided after our meal was served was rather frustrating.  Overall, I'm certain that I would not return to this establishment ever,"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Service slow & the place was not busy. When we finally got our food they put my cold salad on my plate with hot sandwich & French fries. When I asked server why they did this rather than put the salad on separate plate she responded \"you're lucky you even got your food because our kitchen is so backed up\"....We had to flag our server down for refills on water & our bill. The food is decent but this service will keep me from returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here today for breakfast.  I ordered the corn-beef hash eggs benedict and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry waffles.  Food was better than I expected!  Not your typical breakfast joint compared to I-hop and Denny's; will choose Mimi's over I-hop and Denny's any day!  I give the taste and presentation of the food a 5-star, but since service was OK I give Mimi's an overall 4-star."}
{"text":"The food was good, however our server was horrible.  I had to ask for my muffin which was to come with my breakfast , and forget about her asking if we would like more orange juice or water for that matter."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service/waiter is terrible!! Very inattentive and you nearly starve before you can even order. Going on almost 30 minutes and I still haven't been able to give my order... AND it is NOT crowded!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of our best Mimi's experiences in recent history.  I was getting to the point of crossing Mimi's off our list due to extremely poor service, the length of time it took to get food, and the dated and worn out decor.  However, this time the staff seemed more attentive, our food was delicious, and turn around time was spot on.  We had three different people refilling our iced teas before they were even half empty!  The Belgium waffles were outstanding and the bacon was crispy.  The only negative was the very strong and foul smell outside; presumably from full grease traps.  No bueno."}
{"text":"Very good food! Had the corned beef hash and two eggs and the buttered croissant with egg and bacon. Food came out super quick and was very good. Only complaint is that under the table was very dirty and I got syrup on my foot...oh and no music leaving it awkward when we could hear the other tables conversations. Environment was incredible...never expected such a nice place! Bobby our waiter was awesome! Very professional and friendly. We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place and I've probably eaten here about ten times. It's ok for breakfast & a light lunch. The French cuisine menu is interesting, the service is usually passable, and it's hard to resist the constant stream of 2-fer-coupons through my inbox.   Here's the BIG BUT: At it's essence Mimi's Cafe is no better and possibly worse than your local Appleby's. The bread was a bit stale-ish & the madeleines were downright hard. The request for fresh bread was repeated and did not get a response after a while it was brought, but we were kept guessing & the was certainly no apology (ok, we gave it our best shot & now we're pissed!). The potatoes au gratin turned out to be a rectangle cut from a casserole & bone dry. The pot roast was very tender, but so dry that it stuck in my throat. I got more gravy, but it was a bit sweet, very shiny from the mostly cornstarch recipe & not very good, although it did allow me to swallow. Thinking about my experiences there I finally realized that other than breakfast and a cold sandwich, I've never had a Mimi's entree that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Two stars = \"Meh. I've experienced better\".  Which is exactly how I feel.  But, I am giving it 3 because the service was \"A-ok\".  I like to round up.  My husband and I came here looking for a new breakfast place.  The service was ok, the food was pretty Meh.  I had eggs florentine benedict.  It probably sat in the window for a good 5 minutes, my potatoes were cold and the english muffin was stale.  Can't remember what Nick got.   Its really close to my house so I was hoping to find a place to frequent on Sundays that is walking distance.  I'm going to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not what it use to be. We've had more than one bad experience. There are plenty of employees working, but somehow no one is doing the right thing. Waiting way to long to be seated, to long for water at the table, no one sure whose table it is. Brunch took 3 hours and not because we wanted it to. Terrible service. Gave a 2, because our food was good. Just took forever to come out. Just not acceptable. There is obviously a management issue, as there is plenty of staff and they are polite, eager and capable. They were not busy, lots of empty tables. I think there is misdirection. Obvious issues on many visits. Last visit for us."}
{"text":"So this is the deal - one visit, I like it....a lot. Next visit I'm like, nope never again. When are restaurants going to get it that the chefs make or break the experience?  Please get consistent with your product. There must be a reason why Mimi's are closing."}
{"text":"So so disappointing. We've been coming here for years and have many fond memories here but obviously the franchise or at least this location has changed hands and it's horrible. We ordered the appetizer trio - the zucchini was undercooked and barely battered, the chicken strips were flavorless, we barely got 10 overheated (with a heat lamp) chips for our greasy, gloppy artichoke dip. The bread basket was hard and a sad attempt at presentation. The food was too salty, the salad was hot and wilted under the heat lamp before being served and even something as simple as tomato soup was so bad it was barely edible even with a grilled cheese. The pumpkin spice muffin had a huge glop of cream cheese icing inside and barely tasted like pumpkin at all. They only had 4 tables in the place and the rest sat full of trash and glasses. It took almost a full minute to be greeted at the door. And a sandwich with a side salad, pot roast with mashed potatoes, a half grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup, an appetizer, a sprite and a tea was $73!! Unreal. All the charm and quality is gone. Another one bites the dust."}
{"text":"I am a member of Mimi's \"email club\"... and they frequently send out BOGO (Buy One Get One) deals.   Hilary and I used one last night and had a nice meal.   I had for the very first time the beef bourguignon... and I now have a new favorite!!! I have nothing to compare it to (in terms of if its truly \"French\" or not), but I really liked my dish. The chuck roast they used was super tender and falling apart with mushrooms. There is a side of mash potatoes, carrots and broccoli.   I added the corn chowder as an appetizer... also yummy.   My wife has a favorite salad she has there... and she was happy with it as well.   I usually play it safe here at Mimi's and almost always get the \"turkey dinner\", but took a chance last night... and glad I did.   As many reviewers have said... Mimi's is always \"decent\".   If you have not done it yet... sign up for the email freebies! If you use them, it works out to close to $300 in free meals in a year."}
{"text":"Brooke was my waitress and she was more than friendly with us and our 2 daughters. Chop salad great, corn chowder everything., and the muffins are great. Fabulous family local poace"}
{"text":"First tried Mimi's when we first started coming to Scottsdale about 6 years ago.  It was always a \"go to\" place where we could get good food at a decent price.  Don't know what's happened but we've been to 3 different locations this trip and the food has really gone downhill.  Sauces are gummy and cooked to death with too much flour/cornstarch.  Had the crab cake appetizers most recently and neither crab or cake belong in the description.  The crab was nonexistent and they were the size of a  3 inch pancake.  The other annoying thing is that the servers now try to push whatever special is going in like the wine thing or the \"add a soup or salad\" thing.  So sorry we won't be going to any Mimi's anytime soon."}
{"text":"We are regulars and the French Makeover and taking things off the menu has made us go a lot less often. They have virtually nothing for kids there that kids like.  I guess kids are now longer welcome in the FRENCH restaurant.  Our kids used to LOVE to go there. Management is rarely seen and they seem to gossip alot about the other staff.  Nothing is consistent anymore, the excuse is the cooks vary in ability. What is left on the menu has hokey French names and every little thing is EXTRA. This was a restaurant that was like a neighborhood meeting place prior to the French takeover.  Unfortunately, we are looking for a new favorite neighborhood restaurant. When you ask for the Manager Anthony he never has answers only says he will talk to one of his assistant managers. He seems to not do much and pass the buck a lot. We tried this place at night and the serivce was poor. Breakfast service is phenomenal and everyone seems to really care. Wifi is VERY slow.  Never see management out and about like you do at other restaurants. I guess that is a sign that they don't want to hear why their customers have to say."}
{"text":"Went back to Mimi's yesterday for lunch and asked if Corey was working .... lucky us he was.  He's a great waiter...Mimi's is lucky to have him n their staff.  Had a delicious lunch again."}
{"text":"That was excellent service from a young delightful lady named Kearney. She made sure I got nothing but the best: Fresh ground pepper, ketchup, a blueberry muffin she recommended. I never had to ask for a refill. She did all this with a smile the whole time. She would check up on us just to make sure everything was ok. At the end she wrote a nice message on my receipt telling me and my family to have a great night along with a muffin to take home. The experience and the food was amazing. I left her a tip and complimented her. We need more people like her in this world.   I will DEFINITELY come back"}
{"text":"OMG, I Love This Cafe!  So Good!  I have eaten there many times and also in Florida!  The breakfast Is outstanding, warm, delicious, and you get plenty of Awesome Food!  There is a great selection on breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu \"even on the holidays\"!  The Service is professional, timely, very nice, and servers are very attentive to all your needs!  Definitely a place with a great atmosphere, and to take family, friends, co-workers and even a cute date! :)  Go To Go!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.. .and was pleasantly surprised.. had a 2 egg breakfast with bacon and seasoned potatoes.. . Its hard to mess that up so I was a little disappointed with the potatoes..  They needed a little bit more flavor.. maybe garlic or onions.. I couldnt call it but it was one of the blandest potatoes i've ever  had.. their saving grace is their muffins. I had a pumpkin spice muffin and was blown away.. It was absolutely delicious! Moist, spicied and served with butter. That one muffin was more enjoyable than my entire breakfast. That alone will bring me back to Mimi's !!"}
{"text":"It's American food- comfort food- at its best! From an all day breakfast menu to lunch or dinner. I've been a few times to meet my friend on that side of town and we always come to this Mimi's. Great service that is never rushed and great food too. You have got to try one of their muffins."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there Thursday night. The sever was very very slow with everything. I ordered the chicken pot pie it was great and my wife ordered the grilled chicken and fries. She like her meal too."}
{"text":"To be honest, I love Mimi's Cafe but it is because I'm used to going to the one in Valencia, California. This mimi's is totally one interested scenario.  All the staff seems to hate there life and can't even smile. It's like you even make a joke and they laugh like they are annoyed. They messed up on my order and a couple other people's orders in the restaurant. I get it, I used to be a server but you can't be annoyed or show that your not happy at work. Most of the people in the restaurant acted like they couldn't wait to go home and get their side work done. I just think some people need to smile and act like they love their job. At least my server, Azucena paid attention to everything I wanted and was on top of refills. I appreciate her attention and actually taking care of her guests. I just think the vibe of the restaurant fills depressing hopefully they get a remodel like the Valencia location. They need one for sure. Also, the host/hostess needs to open the door not stare at me as I open the door."}
{"text":"Went here to satisfy my craving for eggs benedict with my husband. We both got the basic benedict with the home fries. I also ordered some blueberry muffins and a mimosa. My husband asked to keep the lunch/dinner menu to look it over because we have only had breakfast here and wanted to look at the menu while we waited. They were not busy at all but our server kept asking if we were done looking at it..after asking about three times it got annoying and we just put it down and she immediately scooped it up, it was just weird.  When the food came all looked great and we dug in. I was happy and looked over to see how the husband liked his and saw a horrified look on his face. He had taken a bite and looked down and saw a very large hair on the egg. Also both or our home fries were cold...which has been an issue before. We got new potatoes and a new benedict and both were delivered by a manager that apologized for the inconvenience and hoped this would be better. All was fine until we got the bill and we were not compensated in any way, we even waited a while to see if the manager would come over and do or say something. Another manager was walking around and we called her over and told her what happened. We were told the girl was new and they would of course comp the meal. She actually ended up comping the entire bill..even my mimosa...and that is where the 1 star comes in. That was really great that she did that and it was very much appreciated. We tipped the girl $10 ( our bill was $29.54).  Although they did remedy the situation and went above and beyond what they had to do...finding hair in food and having the issue with the cold food more than twice, is just not acceptable. I was also surprised that since our server was new that when the manager got involved with the issue that they would make sure that it was resolved correctly...or the manager that first came by could have made a gesture at that time to let us know the meal would be taken off the bill. Instead it was blamed on the server...I don't like that at all.   I may go to another Mimi's..just not this one"}
{"text":"At first, we had to wait to sit in a booth, which wasn't a big deal. Then, we had to wait for our server to come over and get our drinks. Considering this was during a slow lunch, waiting 10 minutes for the server to come over and introduce herself was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which comes with a tomato sauce on the side. When we finally got our appetizer, there was no sauce. I asked the waitress (who I will not name) if it came with the marinara sauce. She gave us a curt, \"no, it's not served with anything.\" And then asked if we would like ranch to dip the calamari in. I grabbed a menu, just to make sure that I hadn't read anything wrong, and sure enough it says that the calamari was served with a warm pomodoro sauce. I got another waiter's attention to get the sauce (after ours ignored my attempts to get her attention), and our waitress got very snotty and butted in. All we wanted was the sauce that was served with our appetizer... The salads we ordered were good, and after we got a little rude with the waitress, she spent the rest of our meal trying to make up for her rudeness.  I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The muffins were great... then it all went downhill from there. Our entire party ordered breakfast and everything was cold over cook and not edible. I ordered an omelet and it was over cooked and cold in the middle. Too bad because this used be a family favorite. Manager replaced the items and they were much better second time around... so maybe it was an off day??"}
{"text":"Reasonable adult food when you also have to feed a hoard of kids!  I love the corn chowder, the muffins and we have had generally pretty good service.  My husband loves the variety and the kids will eat anything. Definitely not gourmet food but not bad"}
{"text":"I love this place. The first time we came in they gave us some free muffins to take home, as well as some coupons for next time. I love the food, the salads, the sandwiches (the clam chowder soup is phenomenal!) the deserts are delicious and the breakfast is to die for. The ambiance is all there...a little french bistro and the wait staff is courteous and helpful. Will be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"For starters, I checked in over an hour ago. I was quoted a 25 minute wait. We waited 50 minutes. Got sat at a less than desirable table and asked to move with a little grief given.  That annoyed me especially since we waited double the time quoted and there were several open tables. I have watched a family who was seated long before us get up and leave angry because they still had not got their food yet. The server came and told them there were 5 tickets before theirs. Another table got up after eating and complained to the manager. There was another table which only one person had their food a good 15 minutes before the other two guests received theirs.  Not even joking, another table next to us just got their food and guess what, her plate had to be sent back! It's not even busy in here right now! It is 1:33pm and we are way past the lunch rush. This is a horrible experience today for many apparently.  I have had great experiences at this location in the past, but if this is how it is on a Sunday afternoon, there are way to many other options to select from to avoid this from happening again. The food should be here shortly. This will be a make or break deal here. I sure hope all our food is correct. The food was all correct, but mine came out a few minutes after the rest of my family's.  It was all good. The only thing missed was the extra side my husband asked for. He never got it. The drinks were kept full.  It is now 2:10 and we just got our bill. Long story short, we've been here for over 2 hours, a process that shouldn't have taken more that 45-60 minutes. We will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The restaurant is decorated very nicely, the hostess was awesome, our waitress was awesome. Went in for breakfast, it was the first time I have eaten there. The food was really good and I love the little potatoes. It took a really long time to get our food, not sure why, the place was fairly empty, but the service was good. Yes I would come back here."}
{"text":"Our first time here, we would always drive by and say we would come one day. Well, today was the day. Great food and the customer service was amazing. Our server Jessica was very friendly and went above and beyond to explain the menu, recommend things and I love that she was honest on few things on the menu whether they were good or not. It takes one time to make an impression and thanks to Jessica we would come back to Mimis."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Stopped in to pick up some of thier super good pot pies to take home and was met by a very nice and helpful employee.  She made placing the order a pleasant experience.  Great customer service and food that makes driving to this location worth it even though I live closer to another Mimi's"}
{"text":"*** 3.5 stars ***  I stopped here for breakfast.  It's been several years since I've been to Mimi's and I thought breakfast would be a good way to try the place again.  I got the quatre fromage quiche which their menu describes as Swiss, brie, feta and parmesan cheese with sun dried tomatoes and hickory smoked bacon. Served with baby greens, fresh fruit and a freshly baked muffins.  The quiche was very good tasting and the size was a perfect amount for breakfast.  I did not, however, receive any muffin or bread.  I didn't see the muffin on the menu when I ordered or I would have asked.  I thought with the pastry crust of the quiche, that would be equivalent to toast.  My server, Marie, was very pleasant and refilled my coffee often."}
{"text":"I just move to this side of town  and by far its my favorite . The food was hot and fresh the service was excel . Our waitress was on top of detail and make sure we had everything we needed. The manger gifted is some muffins for being 1st timer . The price was just plus we even got to bring food home for left over . I highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite place to eat.  The breakfast food is delic!  The salads are good portion and come with a muffin.    We were there for lunch on a Sunday two weeks ago.  We had family from out of town, plus my mom, husband, and kids.  The waiter was the best.  He was efficient, friendly, and the drinks were never empty (my husband's test for good service).  We were sitting within five minutes with are large party.  The food came out pretty quickly.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep.coming here.  My husband loves the pancakes.  So I just go with the flow.  But the last time I was here the bus girl  pushed my chair in while I was seated without letting me know so she could get by.  So I was shoved up against my table.   Then when I brought it to there attention they claim she didn't speak English.  Then she shouldn't be working here.  The food order was messed up by our waitress.  She was so focused on addressing everyone as sweetie pie and dear that she couldn't focus on getting the orders right..Today I ordered eggs Benedict and asked to have my English muffin toasted.  They burned the muffin and continued to put the egg and holandaise sauce on top as if I wouldn't taste it.  Uggg!!  I'm don't with this place."}
{"text":"Had a really bad lunch here, server was really pushy and the food was cold, my kids Mac n cheese looked like it was squirted out of a bag ( I could see the bag creases in the food) not a good experience."}
{"text":"Cinnamon Roll French Toast. This was totally out of the norm for me. I usually go for an omelette or some other savory dish. I took a chance and went for something sweet and I was completely satisfied with my choice. The French toast was amazing and my eggs were cooked to perfection. The turkey sausage and fruit is an added bonus. I will definitely be back to order this dish. It tasted great and I was full. What else is there to ask for?"}
{"text":"One phrase.  Carrot Raisin Bread = To Die For!  The initial free bread basket they give out, comes with this bread.  Tip: before they bring that free bread basket out, ask for ALL CARROT RAISIN BREAD.  Best paired with butter and it is spectacular and super YUMMERS!  As for the rest of the restaurant, all the food is pretty good.  I especially love the Italian selections of Asparagus Ravioli, and Chicken Parmesan.  The Asparagus Ravioli is definitely something different and pretty good!  The Chicken Parmesan is a HUGE dish and the chicken is breaded with an extremely crispy and yummy shell.    Their menu is pretty extensive with a number of selections to choose from and they have a special menu with special deals for $12.99 that include a soup, entree, a dessert, and an ice tea.  Pretty good huh?  Setting is really nice, a great place to go eat with a friend, or group of your girlfriends.  I haven't brought the boyfriend yet, but plan to do soon!  Go NOW!"}
{"text":"Since Mimi's is tucked away off Charleston I forget to add this to my list of repertoire's of places to go.  Back home we use to come here quite a bit to meet family for breakfast and since I had such a pleasant experience here on this day, I'll have to remember to stop in more often.   Since Mimi's prides itself on it's French theme it's not surprising that the quaint decor starts before you walk in the door. The restaurant looks like a beautiful French country farm house and when you walk in you'll be greeted by rooms full of ceramic roosters and gold top railings off the booths reminiscent of a brasserie in Provence...only bigger.  We were seated promptly and our friendly waitress was quick to bring out some hot coffee.  Be sure to request the carrot and raisin bread to start. Its moist and tasty and best of all its complimentary.   Lots of options on the menu so it was hard to choose. Brioche, Eggs Benedict, Quiche... If you're not in the mood for an omelette I do recommend the buttermilk pancakes-they were fluffy, full of flavor, warm and perfectly cooked.    Coffee was great with plenty of refills. The hubby had the Quiche Lorraine with a side of Mornay sauce which he loved.    Overall, you'll be sure to find some great menu items to satisfy everyone in your party.  We left very happy and plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Still 3 1/2 stars.  Went to Mimi's Café again for a breakfast date with the wifey.  I am still surprised how packed this place is in the morning.  Lucked out and asked if we could see the lunch menu as well.  Fortunately, a number of lunch items on their menu are available at breakfast (things like pot roast are not).  Not feeling too breakfast-y, the wifey and I opted for something off the lunch menu.  Mimi's lunch menu has many options - from salads, to hot and cold sandwiches, burgers, and entrees.  Many of them looked yummy.  We both chose from the sandwich and burger section.    Wifey had the Bacon Avocado Sourdough Burger - grilled garlic-Parmesan sourdough with avocado, Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, and 1000 Island dressing.  She chose a side of Mimi's House Salad with vinaigrette.  She liked it a lot!  Burger was a nice size patty and cooked just right with some pink in the middle, avocado and veggies were fresh, and the bacon and grilled sourdough gave the burger nice texture crunch.  Overall very tasty.  I had the French Dip (ooh la la) - sliced roast beef on a toasty baguette with horseradish cream and a side of au jus.  I could have added bell peppers, caramelized onions, mushrooms, and mozzarella for an extra fee but decided not to because I really wanted to taste the beef.  For my side I chose French fries.  Verdict?  Not bad!  Good French Dip indeed but I've had it better in other places.  The baguette was a bit dry, but nothing some extra (extra) horseradish cream couldn't solve.  Slather that baby up!  The meat was tender and sliced just right on the thinner side for a better bite, great flavor when dipped into the au jus.  Just wish the meat portion was larger!  I probably should have added at least some mozzarella cheese as well since that would have added some unctuousness to the sandwich.  But a very good effort on a French Dip.  Mimi's Café is not a bad option for a nice breakfast or lunch.  It's cozy and very inviting.  The prices are a bit more on the high side for an entrée, but it's worth going every once in a while for some French influenced cuisine."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in ages! We needed a meal at 10:30 a.m. so it came to mind.  We had a very pleasant experience!   The warm carrot raisin muffin was scrumptious. They serve their butter nice and soft and whipped like. Excellent. I HATE when you have cold hard butter and it rips your toast, or muffin. Get it together breakfast places of America and soften your butter!   I had a vanilla latte. It was yummy. Once again, thank you Mimi's for offering espresso drinks for those of us who just can't get on board with black coffee.   I had a clever twist on a eggs Benny. The traditional English muffin was replaced with a potato cake and topped with spinach, bacon and tomato. So actually, the only thing that resembled a normal Benedict was the hollandaise. Nevertheless, it was tasty. My eggs were poached quite nicely and when cut poured yolky goodness all over the plate.  It came with fruit. They fruit was meh. Sorta green cantaloupe and sorta brown pineapple.   I snagged a few bites of hubby's waffle. Was good. Nothing exciting but good.   Service was fine. No complaints. A-ok breakfast. Good for the whole family. I may just go back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"The carrot raisin muffins alone are deserving of the 5 stars.  This trip the hubby had the chicken pot pie and I had the Quiche Lorraine.  Pot pie was flaky and comforting.  Quiche was fluffy and not dense, just the way I like it.  The food is always good here.  I also had an iced coffee and it was perfect.  Service is 10x better here than the Mimi's Cafe on Sahara.  I took my cousin to the Mimi's on Sahara about a month ago and the waiter acted like he had never heard of an \"iced coffee\".  My cousin had to literally tell him to give her a coffee with ice."}
{"text":"Every bite of my steak and eggs were amazing. Also, I may have had the nicest waiter ever at this establishment. I'd recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Boring place and bad service. The burgers come on regular bread. The fries suck, the menu is boring except the Lemon Creme Mussels. Not coming back anymore"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch after a graduation, party of 8 and service was great and the good delicious.  They put 2 tables together, but it was right by the entrance...I would have configured it in the middle, as everyone had to walk around us...but the food and service were great!"}
{"text":"While I've always kind of enjoyed Mimi's this particular location has disappointed for the last time. The food was totally lackluster and our server moved at a snails pace and served tables who arrived after us first. I believe the last time I was here I had the same server and it was the same story back then.  I've given them my money for the last time."}
{"text":"What is it about Mimi's that makes me instantly feel 10 lbs heavier as soon as I walk through the door?  Maybe they import humid air in here?  or maybe it's the soul food being whipped up in the kitchen?    I've eaten here on a few occasions (not my choice) and both times the food was ok (I opted for salad).  The bread is quite good and so are the desserts.  I am just not a huge fan of the menu and style of cooking.  If you do like calorie packed comfort food then please do stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Went with my Society of Military Widows Board group. From the time of our  reservation via phone to the Man at reception to our waiter Kirk , EVERYONE was kind, courteous and efficient. Our table was all set up when we arrived and we were cheerfully greeted upon entering Mimi's! I have to especially point out Kirk who went above and beyond to meet all our needs, food was served in a short period of waiting, meanwhile our waiter kept us happy promptly serving water and/or drinks. The food arrived Hot or cold whichever type ordered and was pleasing to the eye and savory to the taste buds!  We were having a working lunch and never felt rushed or someone watching the clock to see when we would leave, and we spent some time conducting our club business, so KUDOS TO MIMI'S AND TO KIRK FOR A JOB WELL DONE"}
{"text":"I've loved going to Mimi's in the past but this time it was a big disappointment. I walked in and the host/hostess was nowhere to be found. Since I ordered online I ventured to the TO GO area by the bar. Finally someone acknowledged me and good thing I was late coming to pick it up because I still had to wait almost 10 minutes for them to bring it to me. I ordered the mushroom Brie Swiss burger medium well. It was well done and with absolutely no flavor. There was no hint of Brie cheese at all and looked like the burger came out of a microwave. The fries were flavorful but a bit soggy. The crepe birthday cake was very rich but not in a good way. Something tells me it's time for a new chef...   Update on the previous review... well I can't say it was much better this time. The waitress was very pleasant but the food was horrible. This time I sat down to eat and ordered the west coast Ruben, fries, and a Caesar salad. Well the salad ended up on the hot plate with the fries and sandwich. I thought that was poor form. The Ruben was dry.  I cut the side of my mouth biting into the bread. The turkey and ham were so dry I can see why they doused it with thousand island dressing. They were hoping to put some moisture back into the protein and failed miserably!  The fries were perfectly cooked but just not complimented well with everything else. The strawberry cheesecake parfait... well what can I say other than disaster!  The strawberries looked like they've been stewing for days and the cheesecake portion tasted like nothing but cream cheese. Definitely not going back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I am rating this particular Mimi's at 4 stars because of the amazing, attentive service we received from James.  We were a party of 11 and could not have been more pleased with our waiter's polite and courteous interactions with us. He also honored one diner's 20% off coupon and applied it to the whole group. Mimi's is fortunate to have this polite young man in their employ."}
{"text":"**Gee, it won't let me give a 0!  DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT!** I made the mistake of having dinner here last night and I can only ask... \"What happened to the \"old\" Mimi's that served palatable food?\" I had out of town visitors last night and made a really BAD choice on Mimi's!   The three of us all ordered different dishes and ALL were horrid!  The one common factor was bad food!  The mashed potatoes were cold, flavorless and extremely dense.  After complaining to our server and the hostess we were finally able to speak to the manager...  GUESS WHAT?  The \"old\" menu of yummy dinners has been converted into a \"commissary\" menu - frozen meals reheated.   The specifics:  1 member of my party had the turkey dinner - he said the meat tasted \"funny\" like it had not been stored properly, I was unwilling to taste it.  I had the chicken picata which was NOTHING you'd associate with picata!  Instead of the rich, buttery, lemon/wine based sauce, theirs was GREEN, it had been reheated to the extent that the sauce had separated and had a granulated appearance, the chicken had no flavor and was difficult to cut with a steak knife.  The other member in our party had the Chicken Cordon Bleu...  another menu mystery served with the yellowish glob of \"mashed potatoes\".   Although we called our server over to tell her the \"potatoes\" were cold, no effort was made to replace them!  The server didn't even give the slightest hint of concern over our dissatisfaction! Yes, they did deduct some of the charges it didn't even come close to repairing the damage done to our dinner \"experience\".  All 3 of us suffered varying degrees of stomach distress well into the evening. Sorry folks, the Mimi's Cafe of a few years ago is a distant memory - do not waste your money here! By the way, I've eaten C-Rations and MRE's that had more flavor than Mimi's \"food\"!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, the decor is also way cool. It is a little pricey, but the food and service were good. I had the roasted half chicken with green beans and broccoli. If you go try one of the muffins, they are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe has a very comfortable vibe. The perfect location for lunch or brunch in my opinion. I went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and ordered the grilled chicken sandwitch and the creamy tomato basil soup. The sandwich was good but the soup was my favorite. I couldn't get enough of it.  And what is that sweet bread they bring out before the order comes out? It is so good.  I left Mimi's well satisfied and still crave the soup once in a while. I think it is time to go back."}
{"text":"We used to go to Mimi's a lot.   But last 2 times were terrible. Today was not busy, but the food and service was terrible.  Waitress gave us one breakfast and 1 lunch menu only for the 2 of us so we ended up taking turns with the lunch menu,   French onion soup $4.99 was gross,  while it had onions in it it didn't have any onion flavor, there was  more chees on the outside of bowling then on the soup.  Asked for soda no ice, of corse they didn't even get that right.  The French dips (with cheese, peppers etc upgrade) was tasteless except for the bell peppers  Waitress never bothered to ask us how our meal was, my soda ran out and I had to get her attention for more.  And a French dip should come with a crusty roll/bread, so you can dip it.  But this wasn't, it was soggy.  We ended up eating the meat leaving the bread and went somewhere else afterwards to actually eat a decent meal."}
{"text":"Sadly this used to be a great place to eat but the food was nasty yesterday . The potatoes  served with breakfast were salty and the guacamole was dark and looked older than me . What happened to this place ? The same in Casa Grande -was good but not anymore .. Service was good but food was forgettable . Like Goodyear seems to be going downhill . Won't be back ."}
{"text":"Horrible quality!! Have been eating here with our parents and family for years. Service & food pretty good, no complaints. The last three visits have been dissapointing. Had lunch last week with siblings. The hamburger was undercooked so they brought the same burger back microwaved! Lettuce and tomatoes soggggggyyy! Horrible! Manager was annoyed at our complaint. The fries aren't cooked correctly with lots of grease, not crisp at all. Majority of other completed parties left their fries on their plates without eating them. Doesn't the cook understand that when plates are coming back with certain foods untouched somethings wrong? Bring in better quality cooks and better French fries!"}
{"text":"Back when I was a meat eater, I adored their Quiche Lorraine. It was a good sized personal quiche served with seasonal fruit and the best bread I've had in a restaurant, yum yum! The prices were fantastic, portions are big enough to share if you don't have a huge appetite. I've been able to eat with my sister here for 14.00 or so, but we don't order drinks and we like to share. :) Altogether, I'd still go back to Mimi's."}
{"text":"Took my grandmother there for brunch while she was in town. It was a bit busy but overall the service was good. I had this pumpkin spice pancake with cinnamon apples on top that was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I only know the breakfast side of the menu, but I love it. Kid friendly, take out too. TIP: ask for the Andouille Sausage, it's an off menu item."}
{"text":"My son had the pancakes, I ordered the steak and eggs. There was one waitress and a man who was possibly the manager, and that was it. The poor waitress tried to keep up with the number of people arriving at 7 am on a Saturday, but to no avail. You would think the manager could help, right? The service was SLOW. They are under staffed in the morning.  The price is high (steak and eggs $19). I will probably head to other local eateries that are better staffed and priced."}
{"text":"Wasn't pleased with this place at all. I've been to a few Mimi's cafe and maybe it's just this location, I'm not sure. Brought my sister here cause she's never been to a Mimi's Cafe before. I don't think she'll ever be going to one again.  My sister got the lunch deal, I got the Chicken Alfredo with the side of Corn Chowder and we also got the trio appetizier.   The appetizer wasn't great at all. I've had better fried zuchinni sticks and the spinach artichoke dip wasn't smooth. You literally use a fork to pick apart the dip.   My order that was brought out to me was wrong but it didnt dawn on me till after I started eating it. I was like wait, I ordered Chicken Alfredo Fettucinni and I got some rigatoni dish.   Service was great but all in all, was quite dissappointed in the food. We walked out with a $45 bill and we figured, we would've been better off paying for expensive food at Sammy's Woodfire Pizza (they never dissappoint)."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad nor was the service but there where a few little things that really bothered me about this place.  I'm probably being a little picky here but the place just seemed dirty.  Attention to details are important, people will notice the lack of effort.  The floors were wet from the rain, and I would think maybe someone who worked there would notice, with all the squeaky shoes, and at least would have slapped a caution sign down.  The booth we were shown had food crumbs all over it and the partition above the table was covered in dust.  The carpet looked filthy and the edges of the benches were stained and worn.  I ordered coffee and the mug was chipped and the plate my food was served on was so worn down it was covered in stains and scratches.  I think the worst part was that I had ordered a side of fruit for breakfast.  I got a piece of honeydew, cantaloupe and two pieces of an orange slapped down on a piece of lettuce.  What really threw me off was the whole thing tastes like they had sprayed it with orange juice.  The melons still had their rinds on them and the honeydew wasn't even pitted.  If I wanted to scrape seeds off my food and removed rinds I could have bought a whole melon to take home for the same price.  I probably won't take the time to drive out this way again."}
{"text":"We came in for Bastille Day and how can you not like the 1978 prices for French Onion Soup ($2.25), Eggs Benedict ($4.95), Pain Perdu aka their French Toast ($4ish?), and muffins ($.045)  French Onion Soup - I was impressed because I expected a small bowl with salty broth. It was not. The broth had a good flavor and had some thickness to it that added to the full luscious mouth-feel.  Muffins - were way to big for a normal person to eat by themselves. It was warm and was nicely crumbly. It would be good with coffee like a coffee cake is.   Eggs Benedict - Awesome! The ham/Canadian was a thick cut (not thin and salty), the English muffin was thin (not thick and bready), and the poached egg was perfect. When I broke the yolk, it became my additional sauce to the Hollandaise.   I would definitely come back and now know to order 1 thing, since I think the portions are large."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for giving a star only. We've been coming here for 3 years and just two nights ago, our server aaron or erin was a little distracted but besides that my wife and I we both ordered the Steak Frites... And we thought its texture wasn't right and we decided to eat the whole thing... Long story short, we got home and started to feel sick, we got a very bad food poisoning. So I don't think we'll back any soon"}
{"text":"Our visit started out a little rough...no booths and no Meyer Lemon Mussels, but the manager and waiter could not have been nicer. We settled for Quiche, Chicken Pot Pie and the Chicken Crepes, and all were very good. The mini muffins they serve with the meals are great...we would have liked them to be warm like the rolls, but they made up for that in taste. The Corn Chowder was very good and the side salads were a nice size and the dressing was not to vinegary like many vinegrettes. We will def be back,  but will come a little earlier for a coveted booth and to make sure we get to try the Mussels."}
{"text":"Oh yumminess.  Met a friend for brunch here.  I love brunch and now when I am in Arizona, must have some mimi's!  Delicious french toast, omelettes stuffed with goodness.  And fun drinks too!  Our waitress was delightful!  The whole experience was fun, good and belly filling.  Why don't they have a mimi's on the east coast?  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We ate at Mimi's a few weeks ago, and just cannot get over how bad it was.  So bad, I signed up for yelp just to warn others.  My first impressions were actually good.  I like the dining room, staff seemed friendly, the drinks were nice and I liked the complimentary bread basket. Unfortunately, dinner was on the way. I ordered Beef Bourguignon with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The beef was disgusting.  Terribly seasoned, old, reheated (probably multiple times), I feel a little sick every time I think about it.  The mashed potatoes were bland, cold, and incredibly dense.  The vegetables were a mixture of frozen broccoli and carrots, steamed to death, unseasoned, just terrible.  I took a few bites and pushed my plate away.   My girlfriend ordered meatloaf.  The meatloaf was OK, about the quality of a TV dinner, except it was cold and dry to the point where the gravy had congealed and formed a skin.   Her mother had the petite filet with baked potato.  She was really in the mood for a baked potato, so much so that she confirmed both with the hostess, and the waiter before we even ordered drinks, that they still had some left (It was after 9PM).  They both assured her that they did.  20 minutes after we ordered our dinners, we were told they were out of baked potatoes.  What a disappointment!  Her steak was a joke. Probably 3-4 oz of meat for 17 bucks.  The petite filet should be around an 8 oz cut.   We had some kind of coupon with dessert included so we had to sit around waiting for that.  There was bread pudding, which wasn't very good, and I think a brownie with ice cream, which was fine. Whoever is running the kitchen at this place has no idea what they are doing.  Look at all of the recent reviews, all 1 or 2 stars except for the people who just had bread or breakfast.   This place has potential.  I like the concept, unfortunately their kitchen can't cut it.  I am a chef, and I would never, ever, serve a customer food of such quality."}
{"text":"Not not sure why we came here, I guess to try something different and we were already parked -_-  Or maybe the bf and I remember going to another mimis and the breakfast was not bad.  This time however, was a different story.  The only good thing I remember having here was the tomato Basil soup which was really tasty!  The two other dishes we had were both extremely bland, several shakes of salt had to be used on both of our meals and I hate adding extra salt to anything. *hate to be a negative Nancy but even the dessert couldn't win me over.  The chocolate muffin sundae sounded like a great idea but I'm pretty sure anyone with cake mix and ice cream could've done equally or a better job.  Sorry Mimi but nono."}
{"text":"We had a great meal tonight. Safe, standard fare but the service was awesome.  Melissa was our server.  Friendly, perky and very nice. First time a server has ever come back to the table just to thank us for the tip. I hope the restaurant management is aware of what a gem she is. Thank you Melissa!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I had such high hopes. Seeing a touch of home (L.A.) being constructed brought gastronomic comfort to my homesick heart. Sadly, this Mimi's is only similar in name and branding.   Because hope does spring eternal, we've given this location more \"second chances\" than Hollywood has given Charlie Sheen.   Simply put: The service is horrendous. Everytime. The food takes forever and is often delivered cold or all together wrong. The muffins have been this location's only saving grace; that said, rather than deal w/this red-headed stepchild of the Mimi's I know and love, I found the recipes online and make the muffins myself."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner was sub-standard, and our waitress abrasive & rushed. I was told ahead of time by a manager that the vegetarian in our party could order a larger portion of the garden salad (part of the thanksgiving meal) in substitution for turkey & gravy as the regular menu items would not be available. Upon hearing this, the waitress handed us a menu to order a salad off the menu (all of which contain meat) and walked away. When she returned, we clarified the original request of a larger size garden salad. Not only was it not delivered but when the meals were served, all had plates except the vegetarian who had to again reiterate the request of no turkey, no gravy."}
{"text":"After giving Mimi's a break we decided to give breakfast a try. It was delicious. An overall great breakfast. Service was excellent all around."}
{"text":"I went to the Arroyo Crossing location for lunch a while back and it was kind of slow inside. That was a win for me as they treated me like a king. The food was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Y'all know I like my breakfast some of the food is good, my coffee was burnt, literally. this place has gone down hill I've been coming here since 06, wow it's been a while but she needs revamping or something, I've seen casino b-fast spots better then this this owner needs put money back into her or she's sinking! from my POV, the staff-man or waiter had such personal  hygiene issues we were afraid to eat (for real) those of y'all know me, and I apologize, not picking on no one- we all have issues, but damn! Truck stop Mimi's? Anyone?- lets clean this place up,(Owner-Managers). I now it's busy and hard to do but if not, it's what I'll refer to it as- \"Truck Stop Mimi's\"."}
{"text":"We went for brunch. The staff was very friendly. It was valentines Saturday morning so there was a wait but less than what was quoted us. Servers were very friendly and quick. I had the egg white and veggie omelette and it was absolutely delicious. Freshly made with lots of veggies and goat cheese. Fresh fruit was actually fresh. I got a blueberry muffin on the side which was huge! I took 95 percent of it home so as not to ruin the healthy intent of my omelette!  My kids indulged in the cinnamon bread French toast and strawberry banana Nutella crepes and all enjoyed them!  They also offer smoothies and mimosas. The menu for breakfast is very large with many offerings. Several types of eggs omelette pancakes waffles crepes oatmeal etc. we also glanced at the lunch menu which seemed to have a large variety of choices. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Last week was the first time I went to Mimi's after a really bad experience consisting of horrible food, high prices and way less than decent service. Last week I went twice with a group each time. The service was GREAT the prices seemed to get a bit better, and the food was very good. I like their current seasonal menu and their new for a limited time 3 course menu. Here is some food for thought, ALWAYS get a cup of coffee and bread pudding to top your meal off. They have the best bread pudding!  Recently I went for breakfast with my boyfriend. It was a Friday morning about 10am. It wasn't too busy and we got the best service. I ordered the Crab Cake Florentine Benedict, which came with juice. SOO good! It makes me want it for breakfast every morning! My boyfriend ordered the Pain Perdu Breakfast, which came with juice and a muffin.  It was my first breakfast experience at Mimi's and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I love Mimi's. It is family friendly, the service is great. Kids meals are a bit pricey but they are large servings...Great for bigger kids. Allow yourself extra time because there is usually a wait to get in."}
{"text":"Usually I'm a pretty big Mimi's Cafe fan. Usually... However, last night was a disappointment.  Our server was friendly and attentive, however, my mom's calamari came out like 10 minutes before my dad's and my meal. That was her main meal. We encouraged her to start stabbing those rings, but she sat and waited for us. My dad ordered a side salad. Didn't come. Had to ask for it and then came, but after steak/fries arrival. I ordered Mediterranean salad w/Clam Chowder. I had to remind the server about my soup. Five minutes later, she came back empty-handed and announced they were out. That's fine - it wasn't meant to be.  My salad included their WONDERFUL muffins. Again, had to remind server about this crucial part, as I'm infatuated w/the Honey Bran muffins. I took it home and violated it.  About 15-20 minutes upon departure, I had sharp stabbing pains in my chest area. I took 2 Tums and it took the edge off. Took 2 more. Finally gone. They must have tossed battery acid w/their vinaigrette?!? Smmhhh  Sorry, Mimi's - not gonna be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to this Mimi's Cafe three times in as many months.  Once with my whole family for dinner.  Once by myself for breakfast.  And once with my dad and step mom for lunch.  I think I have pretty well covered the spread at this point and can compose an accurate review.  Lets start with the good.  The bread they bring out in the beginning is pretty awesome.  The mini baguettes are the star of this bread basket.  Soft on the inside while a little chewy on the outside.  Delicious.  Especially with the whipped butter to spread on.  Not that these little loaves need it.  The little football shaped carrot cake/bread pieces are OK but really are better with the butter.  Aside from bread, Mimi's has a really good French onion soup.  It is full of onions and loaded with cheese.  The crouton on top stays crisp just long enough despite floating atop piping hot broth.  This soup is one of my menu favorites at Mimi's.  On to the less that amazing yet still pretty good part of the review.  The salad seems to be enjoyed by my family.  I, however, am less that impressed.  To me, there was not quite enough of the dressing.  A shallot vinegrette I believe.  I suppose it is a good enough dressing I just wish there was more of it for me to taste.  My cheese steak sandwich I ordered for dinner a couple of months back was pretty average too.  Not a major standout but not a horrid sandwich either. The fries on the side are good but I wish the ketchup for them had been left on the table in a bottle so I could smother rather than dip.  I don't like to dip my fries.  But I guess that is just nit picking.  Finally, the chicken cordon bleu sandwich I ordered for lunch was mostly impressive.  Perfectly cooked chicken that was both juicy and crisp topped with cheese, ham, lettuce and tomato on a ciabatta bun.  The ham was awesom and in perfect proportion to the chicken.  the bun was a solid bast and held up to all the ingredients.  All in all, I enjoyed it.  One nagging shortfall was the absence of flavor in whatever kind of spread and/or dressing was on the sandwich.  I would expect something of a honey mustard dresssing.  I don't believe that is what I got.  I had to find a drop to taste on its own to figure out there was any sauce and I am still not sure what it was.  A seasoned mayonaise perhaps?  I'm not sure because it did not taste like much, unfortunately.  It didn't ruin the sandwich but it could have elevated it much more were it done a little differently.  And lastly, the disappointments.  Mostly, breaskfast let me down.  I ordered chicken and waffles.  It took a long time to come out and what I got was a perfectly cooked, thick, fluffy and golden brown waffle topped with two over cooked (I dare say burned) pieces of under seasoned chicken breast.  With enough syrup I made it work but this was not the best chicken and waffles I've had.  I rather expected more.  At least now I know not to order that next time.  There are plenty more breakfast options to choose from.  I'll just have to give those a try."}
{"text":"good breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch with my Mom and wife. We were not greeted immediately as I think they may have been a little short handed, but at 12:45PM (not so good). Once one of the waiters came over to check us in things moved along pretty quickly. We were seated towards the rear of the restaurant in a booth that had an 8 inch split in the seat in the area of the booth I sat in. There were no other defects in the surrounds within eye view and the seat was still very comfortable in spite of the crack that I was sitting on.  Here are the most important reasons you should visit Mimi's. First of all, it's uniquely French in an otherwise very American neighborhood. The food is so awesome that you could pick anything from the menu blindfolded and you wouldn't be disappointed. My Mom had the pot pie, wife had a burger and I went for the Chicken Parmesan. OK, nothing super unique in our choices but getting the basics right at any restaurant is important to us and we were not disappointed.  The pot pie was enormous, hot, and very tasty. At 94 years old, pleasing my Mother is not easy and my wife and I laugh at the various complaints she concocts to avoid eating a good meal. Mom started with the calamari and loved it (didn't quite grasp what it was but she ate every bite). Sue (my wife) and I thought it was the best we ever had - EVER! Sue had a burger that was perfectly prepared and although it was larger than her hand she left nothing but a single bite for me to enjoy. My chicken parmesan was hearty and so good. It was more than I could ever eat, but it really was the best, tender and tasty.  Sarah was our waitress and she was sweet, fun, fast and accurate. Sarah made the meal fun and a bit unpredictable which is what I like in good service. A smile and a good sense of humor combined with efficient follow-through are the things I most enjoy paying for. Her up-sale was smart but gentle. Met the manager Ian and he was fun and made me feel welcome.  Great place, great food, wonderful service, a bit pricey but we will return."}
{"text":"Mimi's used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Since it was taken over by new management I feel it's quality of food and service has declined. I am no longer able to order some of my favorite foods, and my party and I had to wait a very long time to be served. I will not be going there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Here on business from Louisville KY.  Just paid over 17 bucks for 2 tiny tenderloin medallions (filet mignon).  I ordered it medium and it came out over well done and very dry.  Probably one of the worst steaks I have ever had.  I wish I took a picture.  It was also drenched with salt.  We were seated right next to kitchen and all I could hear was people having a conversation in Spanish in the kitchen.  Seems like they were more worried about hanging out than doing a good job cooking.   We were the only ones there which should have been a sign.  I dont like to complain and I hate to see food wasted so I ate it (most of it anyway).  The service was good which is the only reason I did not give it 1 star.  The reason I came here is because the one close to where I live is always really good. This one was just horrible. They need some help. May want to start with hiring a good cook and getting better management.  The food took a long time as well but again. We were the only ones there.  Very disappointed to see a place with potential be so horribly ran. Maybe with better management this place would be better.  I should have checked yelp before I came."}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was forgettable. They also seemed to be out of a lot of things on the menu. My burger came out on soggy toast and basically fell apart in my hands, and my wife's \"brioche croque\" looked like it was on a hamburger bun.   Apparently they think adding an 'e' to the end of words like salad and soup makes them better. I don't know.   Avoid this place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"(6/29/2012) A regular here...but service seems to be going down  Visits are coming less frequent..  I had a late breakfast today.  Asked to be seated in the Winery room....it almost seemed to be putting them out?  The greeter had to go check.  I was surprised when I was taken back and a booth was vacant as well as all but 2 tables.  A smile and \"we would be glad to seat you there\" would have gone a long way.   Those that frequent this business know the room directly forward past the counter must have bad acoustics's...it is too noisy... so I didn't want to sit there.  After ordering I had to ask for coffee refills...not offered or taken care of.  Cup sat empty twice.  I felt like I was being ignored?  Service was very slow today.  Ironically the manager came by asking how things were before the food came...I complained (Not something I normally do) ...it was taking long....his response was \" there is only one server in the room\" and walked away.  Not...\" I will check on it\", or an apology of sort...more of an excuse.  ....perhaps the manager should pitch in and help if the server needs help?   Soon they won't have as many to serve.  On previous recent visits we have noticed the bread basket that used to come automatically, now seems to have to be asked for.  And it has taken asking more than once in some cases.    Sad to see a local business going down the way this seems to be going.  We have enjoyed them for years, and recommended them to many.  I almost rated this as a 1 star rather than 2.  But I don't like giving negative feedback.  I am more of a silent complainer....I just quit going to a place and take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times, and it's never been as bad as it was today.  My dad and I came in for breakfast and we were sat immediately. Our server was very polite and quick. The problems started when the food came. The fruit was dried out and hard, like it had been sitting on the counter after it was cut for several hours. My oatmeal was still in the shape of the pan it had been over cooked in and was dry. Then my dads omelette was extremely small, flat, and over cooked.  We mentioned the fruit to the waiter and he replied that the fruit was cut like that. No...fruit doesn't come out solid like plastic. So I asked for the manager and told him our complaints. We were trying to be polite about it as possible.  He said he would see what happened and walked away. He never came back to speak with us again.  We finally tracked down the waiter to ask for the check and he told us the check had been taken care of. Very nice of them, but the manager nor the waiter told us anything until after we asked where the check was. The manager didn't offer an apology, check back in, or offer to fix the meal brought out. Then I had to break a ten to leave a tip for the waiter, and I couldn't find the waiter again. I went to the front and the hostess told me she couldn't help me and to ask someone else. So after all was said and done, we got change from another waitress on the other side. I left a tip for his service, and we left. The hostess didn't offer any kind of farewell when we were leaving, she had a bit of an attitude.  This place has been getting worse for awhile now. It used to be a great place to eat, but not anymore. Especially after today, I won't be visiting them again. Which is a shame because my family has been eating there for years."}
{"text":"I had previously wrote a review at it was not very good.  Subsequently, I had spoken with the district manager and explained my visit.  He was very apologetic and said they never should have run out of their specials and that the manager should have offered a substitution.  additionally, he had sent me a $20 gift card and wanted us to come back.  We did come back and the burger and french dip were delicious, and in our to go order, we got the carrot and apple strusel muffins, which both are delicious. So here is a business that listens to customers dissatisfaction and made it right.  I sincerely appreciate their efforts."}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but I love having late breakfasts here with friends (avoid groups of more than six; it's hard to get them seated on a busy weekend).  I even like ducking in and sitting at the breakfast bar for a quick brunch.  The place is packed on the weekends.  My favorite breakfast dish there is a riff on eggs benedict; crab cakes (instead of an english muffin), topped with spinach, a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. It's served with red potatoes or fruit.  They also have a really nice oatmeal served with brown sugar, raisins, nuts - a high water mark on the comfort food chart for me."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey dinner. The plate was hot but the food barely was. My mashed potatoes resembled dried out play doh. My mother ordered salmon that was \"supposed\" to come on a bed of spinach. The roasted potatoes looked like the were roasted a week ago and reheated. My daughters order had a side of eggs added... Those never came. The server never refilled our drinks and we were there more than thirty minutes. They really need to get new cooks...it's hard ruin mashed potatoes. The server is not to blame for the food but not bothering to keep our drinks filled, inexcusable. Not worth my money."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Mimi's location for quite some time. I generally get a salad, although I've enjoyed many of their other entrees.  The service has been decent, but lately the food quality, IMO, has gone downhill. Tonight I ordered a Cobb Salad. Partway through I started getting a distinctly MOLDY taste. After a few bites of that, I discarded the rest of the salad."}
{"text":"People have been suggesting Mimi's Cafe to me for years.  I finally went for the first time yesterday and was not disappointed. The food, prices, and service were great!   I had the Quiche Lorraine (about $10) which came with salad, fresh fruit, and a muffin. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Mimi's used to be one of my favorite places years ago, but this place has gone downhill and was filled with only a few patrons. The wall next to me had splattered brown stains everywhere. My turkey dinner was old, rubbery, and dried out. My stuffing and my husband's meatloaf were too salty. Not only did the dishes not look appetizing, they were almost inedible."}
{"text":"I can finally go ahead and give this place five stars because they have Wi-Fi. Long waits don't matter when you have Wi-Fi. your guests that are with you that bother you don't bother you anymore when you have Wi-Fi. life is just better when you have Wi-Fi. The food is good and came out fresh the waiter took care of business.  moderately priced so I'm happy  Disregard any spelling errors or weird text as I use Siri to do my reviews."}
{"text":"I was waiting for 10 minutes for a table.  Five employees looked at us and did not even say hi or acknowledged us. I am sure the food is good . But the service sucks"}
{"text":"I was here early Sun morning w my girlfriend. It was actually not busy at 730 AM. I suggest you go then. The breakfast food is always great, creative, and somewhat fancy. Cindy has a gluten and egg allergy so I think she was less impressed. She prefers Good Egg due to their bigger menu that includes salads with fruit in it."}
{"text":"What happened!?! This place has good food and service at every location except this one.  My poor waitress was \"friendly\", however, another waitress was sweeping around our table. This is rude because sweeping causes dust to fly in the air and if your eating you are inhaling and eating flying  dirt and germs.  The sweeping waitress lingered around our table pretending to sweep, but it was a front.  Soon as my boyfriend mentioned what he was ordering, this nosey sweeping worker chimed in and gave her two cents. Not only did I want her to leave with her dirty broom, but now she is really being over-bearingly rude. This wasn't her table and soon afterwards, she announced that she cleaned her space and was leaving - Thank goodness!!!  The original waitress returned and brought our food. We ordered tea and she never offered refills. Toward the end of the meal we needed a  to-go container and she was slow to bring it, and was more focused on the tip. When she saw the 20% tip, she sort of gave a look of disappointment.   Never will I return. My boyfriend remembered bringing his mom there, many years ago. I always remembered it as a dump. Bad attitudes and snobby wait staff. Too bad because before all the competition came to that area, they had the opportunity to leave an excellent reputation. THIS IS A RESTAURANT WITH JUST THE NAME. EATER  BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Food was exactly what we wanted and the service from 'Kelly' was exceptional.  She offered suggestions as requested and paired wines with our food choices.  We will definitely be back and request her table service area."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday morning it wasn't to packed everyone was very nice. I had the famous breakfast tacos  amazing you should try and had a 5$ mimosas that had you feeling good after 5 sips we'll go back"}
{"text":"Used to love love love Mimis but the food quality has really taken a dump during the past couple of years. So sad. They always had very innovative entrees made with high quality ingredients. The past few times that I have eaten there the food was so disappointing. Crepes were filled mostly with scrambled eggs instead of savory turkey,  mushrooms, bacon and brie. No mention of eggs in the dish description at all.  If I wanted scrambled eggs, I would have ordered them. Didn't complain to the manager since this is the second time it has happened-wanted to give them another chance. And don't get me started on the dry little half sized muffins that use to be big soft and lucious. Don't plan on returning. This is not a location problem. Ran into the same type of issues at other locations. Again, so sad."}
{"text":"Very pleased with their service, choices and pricing. We are a large group that meets there every Thursday and Mimi's crew is very accommodating . Their food is great and the banquet facilities for business group outstanding ."}
{"text":"Love this place. My friends and i go here often for breakfast. The mardigras omelette is good as well as the eggs benedict. this place gets busy in themornings on Sunday so there will be a little bit of a wait sometimes. Overall good breakfast or brunch place, they also serve dinner as well."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast, wait seemed normal no big thing, 10 minutes. Ordered and had the spicy sausage and eggs, it good seemed decent. The staff were friendly and prompt.   Nothing over the top, but seemed fair."}
{"text":"Horrible service"}
{"text":"On 3/11/15 at 9am, place was empty. Placed order and waited 35 minutes for  a simple breakfast. Only received refill on coffee after walking over to waitress who was leaning on counter doing nothing.  No apologies. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've never eaten dinner here before and now I know why. I ordered a chicken dish with fries.i was expecting a breast. No such luck. The chicken was thin, tough, grisly and inedible. I maybe ate 1/4 because I was starving. The rest wound up either spit out in my napkin or left on the plate. The waitress didn't give a hoot. I was with a group so let it go. $20 for garbage."}
{"text":"I was really looking foward to this Place because I love breakfast and I always get salads Togo at the Durango location.but this place is the worst!! The service is god awful.the server was always no where to be found most of the time and she had no personality. ..I had eggs Benedict....cuz I thought u can't really ruin eggs Benedict...I guess you can!the hollandaise tasted like rotten cheese & my sister's burger was gross too...coulda found something better at burger king. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Tried a new place for breakfast, Mimi's in Scottsdale. Won't go there again.  Food took forever to arrive. I asked waitress for extra butter, she gave me a reason why i didn't need extra butter, i said i wanted it anyways.  She brought the butter after 1/2 my pancakes were gone. Waitress never checked back to see how everything was, which should be done 1/3 of the way through the meal, i was a restaurant manager and chef for 32 years.  Then, i had to ask for my check, and was detained another 5-7 minutes before i received that. Once was enough for me, obviously poor managment and training."}
{"text":"The food and service are wonderful. I've eaten before in the restaurant a couple of times.  Tonight I ordered takeout and Sam The hostess was friendly, made sure everything we needed was taken care of and with all the food allergies it's a bit to deal with. She is a sweet, bright, friendly young lady.  We will be back."}
{"text":"2 of us went to lunch here last friday, and had a bad experience. To start we were seated at a table that was dirty. Our waitress was horrible, the meatloaf dinner my  friend ordered was cold. Our waitress never checked back with us once we got our food. I ordered ice tea to drink but never got a refill. The place was not even that busy. Good bye Mimi's there are plenty of other restaurants in Las Vegas. And I thought they used to bring you a basket of carrot raisin bread? Never got that either."}
{"text":"Poor service all around.   Food is not what it used to be.   New management?  One waiter with the manager waiting on tables too.  Come on, higher more staff, please?"}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying that Robert and Erik are the best waiters here. If you happen come here make sure you ask to be sat in their sections. They're fast and friendly.   I'm huge waffle fan. I've been to many places in search of the perfect Belgian Waffle. I've been to locally owned places as well as chains in search of a waffle that knocks my socks off. I have found that place. The waffles are delicious with the edges a bit crispy.  Mimi's has these amazing potatoes too, I highly recommend them. If you want a great waffle, stop by. Your coffee cup will never be empty and your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"The bartender Kelly was excellent, definitely provides good service and very attentive. Good is great and if you want mimosas they have them too."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Michelle, was very attentive to our table. We had our children with us and she was very accommodating with their needs...excellent service!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the past week and every time I came, they said they are out of Avocado, but I found out today, they just stopped buying it because the price went up. How cheap can the owner be? I checked online and Wholefoods has them for $1.99. It's crazy that they sell you stuff that is advertised with Avocado, but they don't give you a discount and they don't give you an option to pay more for the Avocado. This is just stupidity at its finest."}
{"text":"Love their breakfasts and have not been disappointed at all!!  The wait staff has been awesome the few times we have been.  Honestly, we have gone 3 times in the past couple of months for breakfasts with different people and we have all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This place is the dumps.... for food. If you like nice decor and a warm atmosphere its for you but... for food. Its stinks! Very average food and high prices. Its like a Dennys covered up with nice lingerie. SKIP IT."}
{"text":"Went back today. Their breakfast menu has changed a lot recently. The Santa Fe Omelette is back! Today I had lemon poppyseed pancakes with strawberry rhubarb butter, corned beef hash (it's St. Patty's day!), and eggs. The pancakes were really good, and the hash was cooked to perfection! Ines was pleasant and stayed on top of our drinks. Love seeing the hostess help out the server with drink refills when she wasn't busy up front. Teamwork is good! Great meal!"}
{"text":"We just had breakfast it was very good.  Usually we always get different kind of breads which is the best part of coming here.  We have only had breakfast here and it's always decent.... This was the only time we didn't get bread I think the water was new ...... That's what I am going to assume but regardless it was very good.  I had the strawberry waffles"}
{"text":"Breakfast was ehhh. Not flavorful esp for the chorizo burro. Waffles were good. I like mimi's lunch but won't be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ohhhh MIMIS!  Sooo being the cheap bastard I am I seen a coupon for b1g1 free lunch or dinner. Since it was late we opted for dinner. We got here around 6 and had a 15 min wait, even though there were many empty booths they couldnt be used bc the servers were off twiddling their thumbs, WHATEVS!!  So we finally get sat, theres only 2 of us and they seat us in them giant half circle booths... ok? LOL. So I looked through the menu, and at first I wanted to do the Bistro 3 course meal, which was 9.99 ALAS the coupon doesnt include bistro 3 course meals or any 3 course meals. LAME. Since Im cheap I just opted for the coupon deal bc I didnt wanna pay anything. So I ended up choosing this burger with avocado and 1000 island sauce on this gross Parmesan crusted sourdough TOAST.   Now this thing looked like a burger between 2 pieces of toast... but the toast was only toasted on 1 side!! So I ended up getting the sauce on the side and put a little on and salted my avocados. I took a bite and it was ok, then I tried the fries and they were ok as well, after a few more bites my toast became soggy and was SOOOOO FULL OF BUTTER! Yuck!! I asked for a bun or something bc I couldnt stand it! 5 mins later she finally brought me a bun. It was ok, nothing amazing, but ok. The burger was medium and was cooked pretty good.   My ex got the french dip and it looked ok, hes still greedy and didnt share but said it was good... then again he would probably eat a poop covered pretzel if it looked good HAHA.  This place isnt yummy, its just ok. I probs wont go back, the prices equal applebees, but you get more at Applebees. HAHA."}
{"text":"Went about 1 month ago.  It was not good.  They were out of several items.  It was slow service.  They changed the menu and our two favorite items were gone.  The food we got was not very good for what we paid.  We have not been back again.  There are other places on every corner and up and down each street.    The server was nice and we could tell she was not responsible for the changes and she was feeling it in tips and number of tables she got a night."}
{"text":"Rude waiter Fredrick that stuck his finger in my daughters food.    Talked to manager. Said he would make fresh to go. Box came out with contaminated food that he stuck his finger in. . Disgusting will be calling the health dept"}
{"text":"If you have a lot of time on your hands, I would recommend you coming here. My Fiancee and I waited exactly 57 minutes for our food, from the time we placed our order.  There was 0 apology, and the food, which was \"meh\" came out room temperature.  My waitress was O.K., but I felt as if I was asking her a favor to wait on us.  I did get a latte, on my morning there, and it to my surprise was not bad. There was 0 bitterness, and I honestly enjoyed it very much, however, my Fiancee and I agreed we would not come back to this Cafe."}
{"text":"I have not been to Mimi's in quite sometime so I decided to give it another try.  I was very disappointed.  The service was poor.  The food was mediocre.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"It's been a family tradition for my mom, brother, and I to come on Sunday for family dinner for the past 3-4 months or so. Usually the food is good and the service is accommodating. Today was just really unacceptable.  We sat at a table that's next to the kitchen/serving area so you would think that there wouldn't be any screw ups being that we're just that close. The server Todd was slow, but was always in a hurry to ignore us. I had to get water for our table, after waiting 20 minutes for water that never came. I clearly ordered blacken salmon with my veggie pasta but it came out regular salon. My mom and brother ordered veggie pasta (they can't have cheese) and it came with cheese on top when we've been ordering the same thing for the past months when it didn't come with cheese. Todd threw the our dinner plates and ran off. He didn't bother to ask if we needed anything or if our food was correct, etc. so we couldn't address the issues. My mom just picked off the cheese and threw it on a spare plate. I waited another 15 minutes for Todd to come back to ask if we were doing ok, but he never did and kept ignoring our table and I that was when I got fed up and had to talk to the manager. We had to wait so much for the littlest things and we couldn't even get the littlest things. It wasn't even crowded since most of the tables were already done eating so we don't understand why it took forever when the other tables were done.  The manager came out to correct my dish but afterwards, Todd came out to argue with me to say I ordered salmon and I told him firmly, that I ordered blacken salmon and my parents heard me. I mean, Really?! You're going to come out to a table to argue with your customers after you totally ignored them all this time?! You screwed up the order because you didn't listen. That's just SHITTY service and nasty attitude!!!!  My family and I are pretty easy going people, if anything we're more patient. But l I've been a server and I know what it's like. If it's anything that servers shouldn't ever do is ignore their customers and then argue with the customers about what they ordered. Todd gave no apology or explanation it was a mistake. Instead he came out to specifically argue with me. Absolutely fucking unacceptable. The manager knew it was a bad situation and so he comp the dinner. Mistakes are made, but when you make a mistake, you don't argue with the customers about it. Doesn't matter who made the mistake, but you're supposed to fix the mistake promptly to make sure the customers aren't pissed to hell that you're doing a shitty job.  This totally ruined family Sunday dinner. Now we're going to have to find a new place to have Sunday family dinner.  As a side note, I don't know what was going on, but some other customers who had Todd as their server were angry and I saw a table leave before their food came out. Probably a really bad day and our table wasn't the only one who got bad service, but no excuse for bad behavior."}
{"text":"Don't bother going to eat closer to 9pm. As you will find the doors are locked. Even though the website shows their open till 10pm. The door had a sign closes at 9pm. However the doors were locked at 840pm. They are off the list."}
{"text":"I decided to go to dinner here with my partner, I was told by a few people this place was good. So I went and decided to try it out. When we arrived here were maybe 3 guest there total, we were greeted maybe 5 min after we sat down for drinks. The service was SLOW for them being completely empty at the time we were there. Took a bit to get our drinks, we ordered food and that seemed like it took forever, but we finally go our food. I had pork and it was very dry and not seasoned well at all. Overall the service was poor and the food was not the best to write about."}
{"text":"Our family met up with several friends for dinner at this Mimi's location.  We were immediately seated, and the staff was friendly, and very helpful, especially concerning our 10 month son and asking us for his dinner needs right away.  Our food arrived quickly, our drinks were kept full, and all questions we had about the menu were answered with a smile.  To top it off, one of our party was having a birthday, and the staff chose to comp us desert for the whole table.  The food itself was outstanding.  They have recently come under new management and their menu has been changed up.  Gone were the bland flavors, odd textures and runny drippings everywhere.  The roasted chicken crepes were flavorful and perfectly cooked with a great fresh salad, the bouillabaisse was delicious with the potatoes at a perfect texture, and the meatloaf and mash were perfectly balanced together with the gravy to bring out the flavor of the meatloaf and potatoes without being drowned in the gravy.  As for the deserts, we had the apple crisp, bread pudding, and brownie, and while all three were great, the brownie was one of the best I have had.  The food here has taken a complete 180 from what it used to be and I look forward to coming her more often."}
{"text":"I always give any restaurant a second chance even if my first experience wasn't great. For the second attempt I really enjoyed the burger and sandwich selection. This place is not my favorite but its a nice to have breakfast before a hike up Mt. Charleston."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe has delicious comfort food. But if you want good, warm service... DO NOT come here. We waited a few minutes just to be seated when there was only one other guest in the restaurant. No hostess to be found. Our waitress SHANNON was AWFUL!!! After she took our order she never bothered to check on us. I had to flag her down for a refill on a beverage because instead of serving, she was too busy gossiping with her co workers.... right in the open, for all guests and everyone to here. A little smile and eye contact would be nice. If you're not a personable person and walk around with a pissed off look on your face... you probably should not be working in the serving industry. Mimi's management really should talk to their serves about improving their mannerism."}
{"text":"Had breakfast/lunch the other day. We enjoyed it very much. I had plain griddle cakes with eggs and sausage and hubby had chicken pot pie. The wait staff was very good and at the end of the meal the manager or supervisor came over, thanked us for trying them and gave us 2huge muffins to take home with us. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time. Sandwich was a rueben and was delicious. Large portions, had to bring half home. Their bread basket is great. Freshly baked bread and small banana but bread, that I could of eaten that for lunch. Restaurant is eclectic, prices are very fair. Great experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"It was the BFF's birthday and she wanted to meet up for breakfast so we decided to go to Mimi's because it was close to her house.  We didn't think it would be very busy because it was a Friday morning around 10:00 and we figured most everyone was working.  Surprisingly when we walked in there was a group of people waiting in the lobby.  Once we got to the host stand the guy told us it would be about 10-15 minutes because they only had one busser working.  That's annoying because you look around and see all these tables that don't have anyone sitting there but they're all dirty and you have to wait.  We were hungry though and didn't feel like trying to find anywhere else to go so we decided to wait.  I saw several people with delicious looking Bloody Mary's so we went to the bar to order some while we waited.  There wasn't anyone tending the bar when we got there so we stood around for a little bit waiting for someone to show up.  After a few minutes someone came to get our order and make our drinks.  The drinks looked awesome while she was making it so I was really excited to try it.  It did not disappoint!  The flavor was amazing!  My mouth is seriously watering thinking back to it right now.  It was nice and spicy with a great balance to the tomato and the rim of the glass had a chili-lime powder which was great too.  When we were about half way done with our drinks our buzzer went off signaling that our table was ready.  A waitress kind of walked past us as we were going to hand the buzzer back to the host and mumbled to follow her.  We weren't sure if she was talking to us since she had wandered off a little bit but once we got to the host stand he pointed us in her direction and she waved us over with an impatient look on her face.  That was kind of the theme for the rest of the meal as well.  Our waitress wasn't very friendly and every time she got to our table I felt like she acted as though we were taking 20 minutes to order or ask her anything.  The food itself was pretty good, I had the Buttermilk pancakes with bacon and eggs and my friend had the Eggs Benedict which she seemed pretty happy with as well.  I think next time I come back I'll just sit at the bar for everything so I don't have to deal with grumpy waitresses or make sure to drink enough of their delicious Bloody Mary's that I don't realize how poor the service is."}
{"text":"OMG How do these employees go through life this bitter every day? The hostess upon entry? no personality and seemed annoyed that we even walked in. The server. WOW! THIS LADY NEEDS TO RETIRE! Total attitude, didn't make us feel welcome, was rude answering our questions. How does a restaurant not make you a plain crepe with nothing on it!? I will never come back to the piece of crap place ever again. Hope it goes under."}
{"text":"We have been to Mimi's several times in the past and always enjoy the atmosphere. Today our server was very pleasant and helpful. I had the corn beef hash with eggs and potatoes, and a side of bacon. The food was prepared well and the hash was delicious. My wife had the smoked salmon with potatoes and eggs. She felt the salmon was too salty, but otherwise the food was good."}
{"text":"Didn't have all too great of an experience here. Breakfast plate was too pricy to me. Asked what type of flavored ice teas they have, I picked mango iced tea.. the iced tea is dark. Second refill our server just grabbed the pitcher and poured it in, I guess no more mango tea for me. Asked for ketchup twice from two different people, never got any. The atmosphere I get from this place is indifference."}
{"text":"This place is nothing more than an Applebee's, or maybe an IHOP, for the blue-hair crowd. Despite very friendly hosts and some of the best, most attentive waiters in town, Mimi's chow will only disappoint you. We tried a variety of dishes here, from the crab cakes to the pancake breakfast and were thoroughly disappointed. The place makes a homespun, middle-America attempt at showcasing itself as a neighborhood French bistro, but even the worst hole in the wall in New Orleans or Paris outshines the food here - just further proof that substance will win out over style any day of the week. The pancakes are gummy, the protein dishes are waaaay over-sauced and I swear to God, I felt sick to my stomach for a full three hours after the last time we went here. And it's a shame, too, because Mimi's is staffed by a TON of great folks. Yet even the friendliest, most efficient wait staff can't make up for the truly sub-par preparation of the food. We had expected so much more from this place, but there's just no way I can recommend it.  On the plus side, the food is very affordable, but after my three-hour bout of nausea I can see why.  That said, the place is clean, very clean. So it's not a question of sanitation. It's a question of management not hiring cooks who know how to deliver tasty food. Sorry, Mimi's, but we'll be saying \"au revoir\" to you."}
{"text":"Maybe it's this location, but I haven't been THAT impressed with the food here the couple of times i've visited. The Mimi's in Orlando are much better.  I went with a friend this past weekend and I can say that I was disappointed with the wait staff again. The 1st time I went, we had some ditsy air head blonde that obviously didn't pay attention in science class and the rules of displacement. I had asked for a cup of hot water to place a bottle in it, she brings me a full glass of water and gets upset when I tell her it's too full. What does she do? Pours a little bit out and brings it back, so I made sure I made a nice watery mess for her to clean up later. This time around, our waiter wasn't hitting on all cylinders either.   We place an order for the garlic fries appetizer and he asks us if we wanted ranch to go with it, so we say yes. Needless to say, we got our appetizer AFTER our meals come out and the manager apologizing over and over again for a $2.99 food item. Ok, apologize once and that should be fine. This guy over did it.  On my 1st trip, I ordered the honey Dijon pork chops and they weren't too bad. The Dijon over powered the meat but I am glad that it did. The pork chop was dry and didn't have much flavor to it to begin with. The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty good, but that was about it. On this trip I ordered the French Quarter burger and specifically asked no pickle, tomato, or onions. Sadly, I had half an onion on my burger and pickles. Once I got through picking apart my burger and putting on mayo, it was OK. It had avocado pieces, swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing.   For dessert, I had the apple crisp. This was fantastic and I would recommend everybody to try it. They come in 2 sizes, a nice small portion, or a really big one where you have to have at least 2 people eating on it. It comes topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Something nice to have on a cold and rainy night.   Overall, I don't think I will be going back here too often. The wait staff is lacking and the food needs help."}
{"text":"Mimi has always been a hit and miss with me.  However my kids for some reason or another loves this place.  I ordered the bouillabaisse, which was perfect to my taste buds.  My wife ordered the chicken pot pie and it was disgusting because the color of the inside was orange looking instead of the creamy white soft bread.  The chicken tasted old as well.  My kids ordered the lobster bisque, salad, spaghetti with meat sauce.   Hopefully they get better or I don't see them getting any new customers."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 2 star based on my last Vist I go here alot and order take out by the phone alot and always get what I order they are fast and friendly.  But this last Vist was not that experience I order the ribeye which is new to the menu a bowl of my favorite corn chowder.  The soup was tasty like always. Thank goodness I order the soup cause our food took 45 min to get to the table and when it did our waitress said I'm sorry we ran out of ribeye so here is a new York steak instead. I said I wish you would have told me that I don't like new York cut.  She said I'll give you a muffin or a dessert for the mix up.  I ate my potato and broccoli.  She came back and said you don't like your steak I said no. They took it off the bill and gave a salad .  But no muffin . I ordered a Dr Pepper 3 times never got it. My husband order his drink never got it. It was not a good meal. Service sucked. I guess I'll stick to phone ordering from now on"}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option, that's what I'd give. From the moment we walked through the door, our party of 20 was not welcomed. The staff seemed ticked off that we were there. The service was horrendous. Beyond slow. My husband had to go to the bar to check on our drink order, at which point the bartender told him that it was because we didn't make a reservation that it was slow! Okay. So if my party was to arrive separately and sit at separate tables and booths the service would have been better? You're saying that the server would have magically split into 4 different people in order to serve his section? It didn't matter, whether we sat at one table or 4, their was one server for the entire area and he wasn't cutting it.  It took about 20 minutes to place the drink order, another 20 minutes to get said drinks, then another 20 minutes to place the food order, roughly 20-30 minutes to get our food and then when it was time for the bill, they were messed up.  Additionally, other patrons nearby were wondering where their server and food was. Seeing a pattern here?  The manager came over, only because we asked for her. Our friend explained how terrible the service was and instead of apologizing and asking what could be done, the manager broke down in tears. Seriously? Icing on the proverbial cake I guess.  The food was okay. Get it to go would be my suggestion.  1.5 years ago this place was wonderful. Now, don't waste your time. There are so many other options near northlake mall.  Personally I was MORTIFIED for personally suggesting this restaurant to family and friends, only to be served the way we were served, mortified. Thank you for the free muffins. Instead of reducing the bill or even part of the bill, they gave us muffins. Fan-freakin-tastic.   Never. Returning. Again."}
{"text":"This place is really good. They have a nice menu that offers different variety of food.  I especially like the pasta courses.  Its nice to have a blueberry muffin with my meal as well.  This place is great for Fried Zuccini as well!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the turkey dinner we ordered and the customer service. Food was great. Server did a good job making sure we were ok. Turkey was fresh, perfect mashed potatoes. Only reason I had to deduct a star wss side salad was super small but actually good and not a fan of the soggy fries. Looking forward to returning though"}
{"text":"My family has tried several places for brunch over the past 6 months and today we tried Mimi's Café and we all enjoyed it very much. There was a short wait; however it was just after noon on a Sunday.  We could not have asked for a better server and the food is great as well as reasonably priced.  We enjoyed our covered outdoor seating, I did think the inside was a slight bit noisy but once again it was lunchtime on a Sunday.  We had 2 small children with us and were accommodated without a problem.  This will be a regular brunch place for us and I look forward to trying lunch and dinner here."}
{"text":"Quite good for this kind of joint. Portions are large and good to share, if you choose to. Our wait was about 5-7 min on Dec 30th, mid-day. Table was clean and server was pleasant. Brought our tea out promptly followed by some tasty bread. Actual food took a bit longer then i'd like but nothing too bad. If not for nasty little kid screaming behind us like he is being murdered, it would be nice little lunch.   4 stars never the less. Good place! Try their 7 cheeses grilled cheese!!!   \"I like\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"Thought Saturday night would be busy at 6:00 PM, but to our surprise it was just getting started. We don't like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there, not that I'm a \"spring chicken\".  The waiter was efficient, he never told us his name but memorized our order. He made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times.  When he brought out the bread, it was only three pieces of different types: roll, carrot bread and another type. We had to ask for another order.  My daughter had the Chicken Pot Pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part, the crust was only on the top, which was golden brown. To her it was OKAY. My wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus. She ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink, but still eatable. My order was the Lamb Shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Love asparagus!! The lamb was okay and portion was just right. The sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery. The sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable. If you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick."}
{"text":"Great service! Loved the salmon salad! They offered my toddler a \"kid's plate\" prior to ordering along with crayons and kids menu. He really enjoyed his snacks! Kept him busy while we waited to order! :)"}
{"text":"great service!!!!! cooks can not cook NY Strip to save their lives. :-)  don't order steak here I sat and waited for 35 mins and they still didn't get it right I came in on a buy one get one free entree, the manager said that he will take care of it but it was all ready free. still paid over $26 for one good entree and a crappy free one. here is two muffins sorry we suck he said. over all great place not better than Desert Ridge All Day D-Ridge Baby!!! :-)"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and waited to review them, because I was not satisfied each time I came here. The food is good it's the service that lacks customer service. We asked for water and we were ignored. So, I had to get up and ask for water myself... really?! So unsatisfactory!"}
{"text":"This location is really close to home so it has been a convenient option for dinner and breakfast a few times.  Most of our visits have been for breakfast and I've found it to be a solid breakfast option. Even at prime breakfast time on weekends we didn't have to wait long for a table if there was a wait at all. Service has always been friendly and efficient. Pricing for both breakfast and dinner is inexpensive.  My favorite part of the breakfast menu is the variety of options. They have pastries, fancy coffees, omelets, benedicts, crepes, pancakes, waffles, and quiches. I know I'll find something delicious no matter what food mood I'm in. It's also a favorite spot when my parents are in town. My dad prefers a big Midwestern breakfast and my mom likes a pastry with fancy coffee. Mimi's has great options for both of them.    I just remembered that someone gave me a Mimi's gift card for my birthday and that Birthday Crepe Cake is calling my name....."}
{"text":"Mediocre, forgettable food.  I hadn't been to mimi's in a couple of years and now I remember why.  Denny's and Marie Calendars tastes better and are cheaper.   I should have went to one of those restaurants or ate at home."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch omelette and good coffee. Comfortable atmosphere. Service was ok. It was a good experience"}
{"text":"This is the second visit to Mimi's Cafe in Las Vegas Nevada . Mimi's is a very clean restaurant with very clean restrooms.  Today I had a banana chocolate chip muffin \"new on their menu\" warmed up with a little dab of butter right in the middle, OMG! very delicious.  I also had the Asian chicken salad with an extra side of chicken, also very delicious this salad is one of my favorites just the right amount of the sesame seed dressing. The size of the serving  was pretty big so I even had some leftover for later. Others at the table had omelettes that look very very good along with the potatoes those look delicious. I did not have a chance to try one like I wanted to.  our meal was very good. I'm sure we will be back in September."}
{"text":"I have to say I didn't miss coming here. As you walk in the hostess doesn't even greet or smile at you but wait for you to approach them. We asked to be seated outside and we followed her but she just stood there and stared at us. So, we supposed to guess if she'll sit us or we sit ourselves? We sat down and waited for a server but the table next to us that came after us got served first. Food is cold and my guess is that it's been sitting for awhile under the heat lamp. All in all service here is awful."}
{"text":"We have not been to this Mimi's since April as we had found food and service had slipped below what we had been used to from Mimi's. However, we went in today for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised to find our old Favorite Restaurant is back!!! Although it was super busy, we were quickly seated.  Stacey our waitress was bubbly and on top of everything.  Hector in the kitchen did an amazing job with food presentation.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Great menu selections too.  To top everything off, Augustine the floor manager, heard about our previous bad experiences during the beginning of the year and came over with two free muffins.   Will have to share with friends so we can start meeting here for lunch again."}
{"text":"What happened?  Mimi's was our favorite but this location was below average. The service was slow and a very loud sneeze in the food prep area creeped us all out. All the fruit in the fruit cup still had the skin and the cheese was hard on my crepes because it was not warm anymore. Not sure what happened, this place used to always be great. Too bad."}
{"text":"poor excuse for a Westcor pad occupant. See \"Waiting\" (the movie). Yeah, it's that place.  --grilled cheese sandwich looked like a brillo pad after three weeks' use (see my picture) --servers confused, unaware of their own menu --and that was just the content; they were filthy --service timings all off --soda syrups not properly proportioned  methinks it's the location. just stay away."}
{"text":"Food was overall good and tasty. Portions were way to big especially fkr AZ its 115 degrees out. Maybey your corporate Chef can work on portion sizes and adjust the prices accordingly. Service was ok the waitress was a bit pushy trying to be funny but not."}
{"text":"Danielle instantly greeted us and asked if we had been here before. We made a comment about it being a long time and she gave us a warm \"welcome back!\" She was so thoughtful and didn't mind the request I had for my order and actually gave me a better alternative. I've never had that great of service. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here later on a Saturday.  Service was good, food not so much.  Mac n cheese for my son was clearly kraft out of a box.  Daughters Parmesan noodles undercooked, \"bruschetta salad\" was a feeble attempt with tiny pearl Mozzarella was incredibly disappointing.  Stuffing as side for for turkey was clearly out of a box.  Not at all what I expected, but again, server was nice."}
{"text":"I came here for Saturday morning breakfast.  It was pretty busy but we were seated immediately.  The place is covered in New Orleans Soul decor which was very cool but the seating was very cramped.  The menu was very extensive which lots of omelette options. I chose the Mardi Gras Omelette sticking to the theme, the wife had the Chicken Fried Steak breajfast & the kid had Eggs & Fruit. Each breakfast came with choice of juice & bread. I had the Buttermilk spice muffin which was excellent.  The kids food came out and he finished it before we heard anything from the waitress who said she was gonna check on it. 5 minutes later it was served and it was COLD!!!  Having waited 30-4 0 minutes already it didn't take much to turn this situation worse. My wife politley explained to the waitress it was COLD & she would like it done over. NO problem the waitress apologized.  10 minutes later after everyone had finished the CFS re-emerged. this time HOT but lacking any gravy. After that was fixed the check appeared and SHIT HIT THE FAN!!  2 CFS @ $9.99 EACH - We were charged for sending it back!!!  Needless to say after a few words with the MGMT the charges were reversed but we will NOT  be returning. Not very good customer service at all."}
{"text":"Great burger. I want to eat it all but I can't do it... it's big. I especially like to come here for breakfast, the muffins are awesome. Always freindly staff and good service."}
{"text":"My kids love this restaurant.  I know it's a chain but I have never been disappointed with my meal.  Try the pot roast...you won't regret it.  Their bread is yummy and plentiful and we enjoy the ambiance.  I wish they had a patio.  I want to come back and try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ate the buttermilk pancakes and since I ate them the first time I liked them alright.  Loved d syrups. :) not sure if there are any other veggie pancakes.  Does anyone know any? #pancakes #mimiscafe"}
{"text":"Mimi's is one of my favorites. I love there French onion soup, tomato bisque, and their many options of desserts. Crepes are great too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Mimi's is fantastic.  I've never had lunch or dinner at this location, but since I have eaten at other locations of this chain, I feel safe saying it's probably just as average as the others.  I had the belgium waffles which were crispy on the outside, and light on the inside.  Done right and tasty.  Although, they do come out with an unnecessary amount of butter and syrup.  My girlfriend ordered an omelet, and asked them just to put a little of bit of cheese and mushrooms in it (she wasn't fan of any of the combinations listed on the menu).  It came out quite well.  The omelet comes with juice, a muffin (which was awesome!) and potatoes.  When compared to some of the other big breakfast chain, Mimi's is probably the best.  The price is a tad high, but you do get a lot of food.  Also, if you're like my Dad and looking for a deal and don't mind giving a restaurant your email address, Mimi's does send out a ton of coupons.  Buy One Get One Free seems to be most common."}
{"text":"Exceptional food choices. Quick Service. Great waitress. Wish there was more around town but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Are you still love this restaurant. The food was well done and beautifully presented. The staff was attentive. The past few times the service has been poor and the food has been thrown on the plate. I tried to give it one more chance today and was sorely disappointed. The fruitprovided instead of potatoes was a bowl of grapes with two orange slices thinly sliced. There was no garnish. The waitress left coffee and cappuccino and made no attempt to wipe the cups or the saucers. Waited a very long time for coffee refills. $40 for two. They have lost my business as there is generally a long wait and the food and service are just not worth it. Actually, even without a wait I would not return here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Quiche lorraine served with potatoes was tasty, but a heavy rich dish--maybe just a bad choice. The good part was we had a coupon for a free entree.  I found our server to be annoying and brusque.  She did not contribute to a relaxing experience at Mimi's."}
{"text":"What happened Mimi's? Was it the economy? Did you just get really bad really fast and I didn't even notice it?  Mimi's was introduced to me when I lived in Reno, NV during my college years. I tended to like the restaurant, although a bit pricey for a college student, I still indulged every once and awhile. Even though it was chain - it was quaint. But this Mimi's.... yikes, not even close to what I remember Mimi's to be.  First off the place is so ridiculously loud it reminds me of being in my middle school cafeteria. Not even high school - MIDDLE SCHOOL. Loud, obnoxious, you have to yell across the table at your fellow diners. I could barely hear what my boyfriend was saying half the time we were eating.   Next - food! Honestly I'd like to give the food 1 star, especially their selections. $1.99 to add on soup or salad? SHEESH. Come on Mimi's... is your soup and salad made from gold? I don't think so. I had the $10.99 lunch time special, basically I thought it was the only thing on the menu that was worth the price. It came with your choice of an entree and a soup or salad. I picked the French Onion Soup and the Brie Burger. I should have known better than ordering the Brie Burger. Brie is a delicious cheese, but done poorly it is tasteless and this was definitely tasteless. This burger was a catastrophe. TINY piece of brie, seriously, you can't even give me a big hunk of brie? You have to have a bunch of it to get the taste! Also, the burger was supposed to have dijon on it, which I thought would be an amazing addition. NOPE. They gave me half a shmear of Dijon. I could barely taste it! This burger should be ashamed of itself.  And about the soup.... how dare you screw up French Onion soup Mimi's. This is the one place where Americans might extend their culinary desires and order some delicious \"French\" food. But no. You can't even do that right. A sad little crouton, barely any onions, and although the cheese was melted nicely on top there was NONE IN THE SOUP! Who does that? ARGH!   Lastly, the Mimi's in Reno (at least when I was there) were not stingy with the complimentary bread. Our waitress brought us THREE pieces of bread. There are two of us. WHY would you bring two people THREE pieces of bread? You can't even bring two of each? Two of the rolls and two of the brown bread? COME ON!!  Mimi's management must be cracking down on their servers here and the economy must be cracking down on Mimi's. From the experiences I used to have, compared to what it is now is just sad, sad, sad."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and service. Ham and egg white omelette was tasty. Carrot cake house bread is a nice touch. Rebecca was a good waitress."}
{"text":"My server Kyle was absolutely amazing! Who ever is management most definitely needs to recognize that he followed all aspects of what they ask for employees to do when they were here. From bonjour to Bona petite he said it all I know that's required/asked for each employee being that I am a former employee so great job Kyle food was amazing as always and I'll definitely be back and have Kyle again as my server very pleasant and smiling and happy!!  and my pup loves the patio thank you haha"}
{"text":"Oh how terrible! My mom, sisters & I had lunch here & to our dismay Victoria, our server, was very rude! No offer of bread & after we requested it she rolled her eyes & huffed off. The food was not very good, and we left feeling unsatisfied & nauseous. Needless to say, we will not go back!"}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is one of my mom's favorite places to eat.  We went there the other night for dinner and it was very good.  We share their new advacado bacon cheeseburger.  It was yummy!"}
{"text":"I held an event at this Mimi's yesterday evening. The service and hospitality of the staff were perfect. Everything ran smoothly, guests were delighted with the pleasant, welcoming and professional atmosphere, and the food was delectable (we ordered several appetizers, beer and coffees). I will continue to hold my events here (we are Tech Modern Artists Of Las Vegas, from Meet-Up.com). Can't imagine a nicer spot with better food, for a large networking group. Five stars across the board!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. It took 5 minutes for someone to realize I walked in the door and needed a table, I unlike most people do not seat myself unless I am supposed to. Finally a server noticed me and sat me. I have been sitting at my table for more than 15minutes, no one acknowledged me, no drink offer nothing! When my mother came in to join me they finally noticed us. This is not how you treat your customers, even if it is somewhere like \"Mimi's Cafe\""}
{"text":"At the least the salads and bread was ok. Waited long time to be served the salad with the blue cheese or utensils. There were no refills on beverages and a filthy bathroom with overflowing garbage. It is so obvious that the employees and management just don't care."}
{"text":"We love this place. Even my daughter (9 yr old) love this place. Their menu has been changing in the last 2 years and right now they have very good options. We specially like their meatloaf and their roasted chicken. The service has always been very good with very attentive waiters. We go there at least one or 2 times per month whenever we want a nice, not expensive meal. Oh and their crème brulee cheesecake is delicious."}
{"text":"I just finished having lunch here for the first time.  Atlantic Salmon and French onion soup. Fantastic food, and great service. Throughly enjoyed this dining experience, and will be back again for more."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I've been to a Mimi's, so when one of the other two couples we were going out with suggested it, we agreed.  I ordered the chicken breast from the 3-course seasonal menu.  It came with soup or salad, the main course, and a mini-dessert.  I decided that for once I'd say no to dessert, and the waitress let me have the soup and salad instead of dessert.  I had the French onion soup, which was very good.  Though I love it, I usually never order it anywhere because it's always way too salty.  Happy to say that it was much less salty here, and after that and the salad, I was finished.    Knowing that I'd be eating at home solo the next night, I took the main course home.  It's a good thing I fill up easily; otherwise there would have been no leftovers.  The chicken breast was really, really small.  It was the smaller half of a chicken breast, covered with bacon and cheese.  It came with a creamy tomato sauce with diced artichoke hearts.  If it had been swimming in the sauce, I may not have noticed the size, but I asked for the sauce on the side.  It was dwarfed by a big mound of mashed potatoes, and a very tiny bit of fresh vegetables - two broccoli florets, and two slices each of green and yellow zucchini.  When I had the main course tonight, it was good, but nothing to rave about.  Service was efficient, but not overly friendly.  With so many great restaurants to choose from in Vegas, Mimi's will never be my first choice, but it's definitely an okay occasional alternative."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since we went to Mimi's.  I recently signed up for their club, so since we had a BOGO, we decided to go back to one of our original haunts when we first hit town.  Not much has changed at Mimi's since then, except that our more sophisticated palates, the plethora of restaurants we now have to choose from, and the quality of the newer offerings make Mimi's seem like a throwback.  I ordered the salmon.  I almost never have that unless it's wild salmon, and this was Atlantic, but all the other offerings seemed too heavy.  The menu stated that it was \"with a light Chardonnay Dijon sauce, but I was dismayed to find that this was a cream sauce, which I avoid like the plague.  That wasn't explained on the menu, which is glaring, IMO.  I'm not one of them, but there are many lactose-intolerant people who need this information.  The waitress offered to change it, but there wasn't anything else that piqued my interest.  The sautéed garlic spinach and roasted potatoes that came with it were delicious, and I had no complaints about the salmon itself, which was properly cooked.  My husband had the pot roast and he was satisfied with it.  Service was very good, efficient but a bit impersonal.  Overall, Mimi's is okay, but nothing that sings to me and makes me want to rush back.  With so many terrific restaurants in our town, this one will remain an afterthought."}
{"text":"When typing in dog friendly restaurants, Mimi's Cafe comes up. Two hours into my families stay, where my dog was quite, well behaved and a service dog; the new general manager Mike Bell was very unprofessional, came over to us as we are finishing, aggressively made  scene about our dog staying on the patio my sister as she tried addressing the situation, he pushed her in front of 20 other guests in the restaurant trying to get past her.  Completely unnecessary and inappropriate. We are regulars at this location and love the staff and love the company but this new Manager is unfit to represent the brand of Mimi's Cafe."}
{"text":"I experienced an amazing staff. Everyone is just as nice as can be. They care about you and make sure you have everything that you need. Food was excellent, fresh, hot and exactly how you ordered it. What a great place! They deserve your business! Can't wait to go back and am going to recommend to everyone I know. Thank you Mimi's! Other restaurants show use you as a model."}
{"text":"I came here and surprisingly ordered off their \"Fresh & Fit\" menu. What can I say I'm trying to get more veggies into my life. I ordered a veggie wrap with hummus dressing which also came with a side salad. It was packed with flavor! Who needs meat when something tastes this good!  The balsamic dressing on the salad was also tasty. My meal was really filling! My husband's Fresh & Fit meal which was a chicken sandwich was skimpy . His side consisted of two lonely  pieces of melon . His plate looked a bit empty so I shared my salad with him.   When we arrived in the mid afternoon there was plenty of seating . We were surprised because the last time we were here for breakfast we walked out because it was too busy. That is why were skeptical about coming back but I'm glad we did!"}
{"text":"Charming building as all Mimi's are. Lovely decor. Pretty good food. Decent prices. Only 3 stars because...... They were very much not busy at all (dinner time), yet the service was amazingly slow and spotty. We watched as two groups came in while we were eating, no host or hostess was anywhere to be seen, they waited about 5 minutes, the second group of 5 gave up and left. The first, an elderly woman with either a friend or daughter, finally got seated... Our waitress was super nice, yet very slow on service, as well. We could hear employees talking back in the kitchen, like they were just hanging out behind the scenes. Didn't seem very professional at all. I hope they improve this.  One plus: my birthday coupon was expired, but they still honored it and gave me a free slice of cake. :)"}
{"text":"Our visit was just OK- I'd say 2.75 stars.  My Quiche Florentine, with a side salad and buttermilk muffin were tasty: loved the textures in the quiche-- fluffy eggs, parmesan flavor in the egg and spinach mixture, as well as baked into the buttery crust itself, without the whole pie being too rich. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mimis-cafe-scottsdale?select=C9NjoQOwjlnegvD_qBzXOg  Also, as our server pointed out how she loved that the spinach leaves are whole and radiate from the center, rather than in small bits scattered about.  The presentation was very nice.  My coffee, served black, was OK.  Don't know why the photo I took of Mom's Mushroom and Swiss burger on brioche didn't materialize, but she said it was delicious; It certainly looked appetizing.  I had a bite of the frites, and it looked overcooked, yet soggy, and tasted greasy-- what most \"frites\" turn out to be, or what most of my experiences of frites have been, anyway.  Service was decent on our table, but I could faintly hear complaints/observations made by some of the employees there.  It's a bit akin to hearing cooks shouting expletives from the kitchen-- makes me feel a bit uneasy, but helps to remind me to be a little more careful not to repeat similar actions while at work myself.  Striving for more professionalism never hurts!  Oh, and the atmosphere seemed changed from our last visit at a Mimi's Cafe, which were a few years back (maybe six or seven years ago, back when their current Thanksgiving special of $19.99 was offered at $14.95).    I'd return for the quiche and the buttermilk muffin! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mimis-cafe-scottsdale?select=4mdmU8t0qN3t2OZAP04BGw  I'd return to try other muffin varieties, as well as try items from the specials board.  Do consider signing up with your email for specials.  We used a buy one, get one with the purchase of two beverages coupon.  I was hoping to try out their steak entrees, but Mom wanted to try the burger, so the steaks will have to be for another time."}
{"text":"Awesome! Just what my wife and I were looking for. We were in the mood for good old comfort food. Good size portions and fresh . Hostess very friendly and Anthony the waiter was great."}
{"text":"Menu options/varitey have decreased dramatically. Came in for late lunch on the weekend and it was empty. There were 5 of us and they wanted to put us in a tight booth...when the rest of the restaurant was open. We asked for a bigger table and even pointed to a different section....they said we cant and the booth was our only option. I said we order a lot and I KNOW it will be a tight fit. They said this would be out best option. As expected with 5 drinks and just 2 appetizers... you could not move. They had so may other menus/decorations on the table ...i had to move them, just to be able to fit the food. I had to get up and tell the server to give the bill for the 2 appetizers so i can pay and leave. He asked why and i showed him that this is not how we wanted to eat! Paid exact amount and left..they dont deserve anything more."}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant but every time I come here I like it less and less. They use to have flavored coffee that's gone, today I find out they no longer have their herbal raspberry ice tea. Their mixed fruit as a side is a joke it's a tiny cup with a couple grapes and 2 tiny orange slices thanks but that would cost maybe 30 cents at a grocery store. This places just continues to go down hill. No wonder they always have a coupon for a free meal, which is only for lunch and dinner, cause breakfast is the only meal worth eating here. I don't think I'll ever return for anything other then their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Toast was burnt, food was okay, service was wanting. Had to ask for coffee twice before our cups were refilled, same with water.   Waitress seemed to  be some else."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving dinner this year at Mimi's because I've always had very delicious food here. The portions were huge and should have been on bigger plates. The food was very good. The turkey was shredded (not sliced) and placed on top of the stuffing which had a mash potato consistency but was flavorful. Couldn't figure that out. The soup and salad were delicious and would definitely eat Thanksgiving there again if I wasn't cooking it. Also, our server was very attentive and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. Too warm and dirty. Yuck! Not much more to say."}
{"text":"I come to this Mimi's all the time since it is next to the car wash and I can kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  I love the food here and the atmosphere is by far the best in the area.  It is a french bistro looking on the in and outside (great seating outside too)  All the food is always done just a little bit better than most breakfast places.  I love the bacon and eggs, breakfast quiche, pancakes, french toast, most of the omelets.  The coffee is great, and the large orange juice is just awesome.  Service is always perfect.  I have never been here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I am only reviewing it with 2 stars because my waiter was too busy and I don't think that was his fault.  We showed up and was able to sit right down which is great because when we left there was tons of people waiting.  We had a coupon for joining their mailing list that gave us a free meal with the purchase of another...which is awesome because who eats alone?  They also recently remodeled the interior and it looks pretty good.  My wife ordered the usual broccoli quiche and it was only a little warm.  I usually order the bacon and eggs which is awesome but today I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it was very good.  The food is always great here....when its warm and the service is usually awesome except today, but I wont blame Kevin since he was obviously over-sat.  I hope they get their stuff together because I WILL go back and I know that I WILL be able to write a better review afterward since I have been here 100 times and this was the only poor experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Average food and average seasonings this is the type of place that yoy go for a Dennys type of meal. The bread selection before the meal is really the only thing that stands out above the rest definitely try the bran bread very tasty. I have had both the new York strip and the French dip both were fine just not anything special for the prices they ask the roast beef on the French dip is very tough and has a hard bite to it the aus jus is lightly seasoned and nothing special and the horseradish sauce is unappealing at best really. With the steak I think maybe the cooks just aren't  well versed in the art of preparing a new York strip just making an average ho hum run of the mill chuck and again for the price just not worth what you are paying."}
{"text":"We immediately noticed that the staff seemed really unhappy.  The greeter was not friendly.  The waitress was extremely efficient but also not smiley.  It makes you feel as though you are imposing on the staff by coming.   Of course we never know what is happening in people's lives, but I am not naming any names, so no one is getting hurt.  After being patrons since 1999 we have come to expect much better.  We were told we would have to wait 20-25 minutes for the pot pie- ok.  But you changed your authentic chicken pot pie, made of pie dough and real pieces of chicken to a bowl full of goo, pre fabricated pieces of chicken with flaky frozen biscuit dough on top which immediately became soggy. This was what I waited 25 minutes for?    It was not even edible.  It appears you have gone down hill.    Also, we were sat right by the kitchen and it was so loud you could barely hear people at your table at times.  An employee was standing on the booth next to us washing windows. This is something that should be done after hours.  It was just unpleasant, all of it :(   Not coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. My husband is quite particular about food quality and preparation. He loved his steak and scallops. My chicken crepes were delicious.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Service has been slow in the past, but today's lunch was speedy and tasty. Requested our favorite server Charles,  he never fails to deliver with a smile. I brought 4 dozen muffins back to the office and became very popular!"}
{"text":"Food really good.  Service so so.  This place has a good reputation.  Glean your drinking glasses they look filthy!!!"}
{"text":"It was a great restaurant before the recent  overhaul in decor, it looks bland and generic. Food has also changed, used to be you couldn't find a bad item now it's spotted with mediocre offerings, they must of changed either recipes or chefs.  Don't go by previous rep it's totally different now."}
{"text":"On 3/27/18, we called in a take out order for carrot muffins and oatmeal. I had undergone surgery and wanted to get something quick. My husband waited over 15 minutes for a call ahead order. The manager apologized but that's it. Did I mention they did not provide cutlery, condiments or necessary napkins. The oatmeal was so dry, I threw it away. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast/lunch the other weekend with a friend. She ended up ordering a few breakfast sides and I ordered the Roasted Chicken Crepes with a house salad. The food was pretty good, but the mimosas are what made the meal. I like Mimi's, but prefer more trendy places for breakfast/brunch. However, I would return as long as there wasn't a wait."}
{"text":"When Mom and Dad are in town, we always go to Mimi's Cafe for breakfast. Mimi's Cafe is a real treat. Decorated in a French Quarter/Jazz motif, Mimi's serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in large servings at reasonable prices.   The breakfast menu is the usual fare (pancakes, french toast, 3 Egg Omelettes) but they offer a few suprises (Eggs Benedict, Oatmeal). Interestingly, some entrees include a free glass of OJ.    The real highlight are the muffins (Pumpkin Spice, Honey Oat Bran, Carrot Raisin, Buttermilk Spice and Blueberry). They are delicious. TELL YOUR WAITER THAT IT IS YOUR 1ST VISIT AND HE/SHE WILL PACKAGE SOME TO GO FOR YOU, ABSOLUTELY FREE.   The lunch/dinner menu is more of the same... I recommend the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta. Like everything else at Mimi's, it is huge and delicious.  Serves expresso, beer, and wine. The wait staff is exceptional."}
{"text":"Perkins in a prettier building with a wine list. I really liked my eggs Benedict Florentine (with spinach and bacon.) The other half of my large plate was filled with their very tasty roasted potatoes. My husband ordered a Santa Fe Omlet (peppers, onions, veg, melted cheese) that was huge and solid, but a little dry, also served with potatoes. Enough food on two plates to feed a small army.  We shared a very flaky croissant. Atmosphere is pleasant; service friendly and prompt. Not worth a special trip but a good bet for breakfast if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and lunch. Quality food and you get plenty with your order. Good drink menu too. I always get a French Bloody Mary. yum!"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would...that should really be an option on here. Service wasn't great but the manager was nice, all of our silverware, cups, plates, everything even the plate that just the sugar for our coffee came on had a soapy residue, and to top it all off after waiting nearly 30 minutes for the Orange creme French toast and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict.....the Benedict was cold and the French toast was not what it said on the menu it said brioche bread and they gave us two pieces of soggy white toast. We will not be returning. It almost felt like they were trying to achieve a French feel and failed miserably."}
{"text":"The food was good - easily worth 3.5 stars.  But the service?  Ay-ay-ay!  We went here last Sunday to celebrate an occasion - so there were about 20 of us.  We were promptly seated in the reserved area in the back, and given a prix fixe menu. The waitress sat down at the head of our table and announced how tired she was.  Then the train jumped the tracks.    When it was my turn to order a drink, the waitress seemed nonplussed that I'd asked what beers they had on hand, and promised to get back to me.  It took a while, and then she could remember only three of them.    By the time we got to order our food, everyone else's drinks had arrived... but mine.  (I just wasn't ready to capitulate and have sweet tea or water like everyone else!)  About 20 minutes after ordering, the food started to arrive (still no beer).  ...and that's when the manager came out to say they'd run out of what was on the prix fixe menu, and would we mind ordering something else?  (Mind you, they knew we were coming FOUR days ahead of time, and THEY were the ones that came up with the menu.  HOW could they run out?!?)  When I went to place my alternate order, I told the waitress that I wanted my beer FIRST, and then my food.  (Silly me... it took another 10 minutes to get the beer, and 20 after that to get the food!)  Seriously, there were folks in our group that had finished dessert before others got their entrees.  Okay - now that I got that out of my system, let me say that the Jambalaya was very respectable, and the apple cobbler was terrific!  I just couldn't believe the waitress waited until she'd served dessert to ask if anyone wanted her to put on a pot of coffee.  (Sigh...)"}
{"text":"I've always been on the fence about Mimi's.  I used to hate the place.. why? I have no idea.  I think I came here and had a turkey sandwhich that was dryer than the arizona desert.  That's it..    The last few times I've been to a Mimi's they have been pretty damn good.  They have a huge variety of food to choose from so whatever you feel like, you can pretty much get.  I love the bread that they give out.  they have weird bread that is sweet that I cant think of the name, and it's just amazing.    I hear their breakfast is awesome, but I have yet to try it.  I will look foward to it next time!  Why three stars?  Im judging this location.  It was still a Mimi's, but didnt have the feel like the others do.  Seemed more alone and secluded and not many people were there.   Plus.. not to be a stickler, but it's in the dying Metrocenter lot..  yeah yeah..   My favorite Mimi's are Chandler/101 and Ray/48thSt."}
{"text":"Normally love Mimi's Cafe and have had such a great time at each one. However, we were placed in a section near the bar and there was a very foul stench, almost like sewer belch, throughout our entire meal. Needless to say, didn't compliment the food very well. But overall, great food. Service was okay, and atmosphere had terrible odor."}
{"text":"Everything was average at best -- service, food, atmosphere. They were very disjointed and just not friendly -- seemed the employees were stressed out."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed after my visit this morning. Not only did I spend $50 but I got attitude when I asked to wait for a booth and after we put in our order it took forever for our food to reach us and both my son and I were served cold food. Only reason I'm giving two stars is because the muffin was good and the fruit that came with my dad's meal was fresh. I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! THE BEST breakfast I ever had! The Hickory-Smoked Ham and Swiss Crepes are to die for! And the White Peach Mimosa was deliciously fantastic!  Friendly, prompt service and nice morning atmosphere added to a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Good salmon on greens salad with hard boiled egg slices, and potatoes and green beans. As crazy as this salad sounds, it was very good. Salmon was grilled perfectly!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Mimi's Cafe in a while. I was excited because the last time I went there I loved the food (especially their zucchini sticks).  Tonight we were sat down, and it seemed like the menu had changed a lot (I could be mistaken).  Anyway I ordered the a French Quarter burger with extra dressing on the side and my friend ordered the Chicken Cheddar Mac. We recieved my food and I was very unimpressed. There was a side of dressing, but zero on the burger.      So I took a big bite (i didn't know at the time there wasn't any dressing) of a VERY dry burger (like even if the dressing had been on there it still would have been dry) plus the the bread was soggy and the pieces of avocado was only placed on one side of the burger (doesnt make for any kind of cohesive bite). It was almost like it had been sitting out for a bit... My friend liked her chicken cheddar mac, but did say the sauce was REALLY thin.   I explained to our waitress, Katie, and she offered to find something else I liked. So I looked at the menu and just picked whatever I had read before bc I felt like I was on the spot because she was waiting there and I just got the menu. So, I ended up get the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta sandwich. Again, not worth the money.  There was absolutely no pesto and it (I cook w pesto a lot) looked like they used just plain mayonnaise which was another big disappointment. The sandwich was mediocre at best. Something I could whip up in 3 minutes. I ate about a 1/4 of it and then took it to go. The only thing they had going for them on that plate was the fresh fries (although they were not at all salted).   Unless we have a coupon or someone drags me here I wont be coming back. It's just mediocre food that's over priced.  On a lighter note though, our waitress Katie was polite and did try to make it better. My only issue with her was that I asked if I could replace the fries with zucchini sticks, to which she said I dont know and didn't even bother checking. Even if there was a price difference I would have been Ok with that, but she did nothing to find out or help. The, I'm assuming here, supervisor was nice and did ask to see how my meal was going after I had the replacement.  Basically, not a stellar experience. Disappointed with tonight's dinner."}
{"text":"Bland is the best description of food taste I can post and remain civil. Long service wait for food. Better choices are available in a restaurant-rich area of west-Glendale/Peoria."}
{"text":"I  would give this place 4 stars because even though I like their food and portion, sometimes I get a lousy service. But still a good place :)"}
{"text":"I have only been to the location in Summerlin on Fort Apache, but I heard they also have a location in Henderson. The location in Summerlin is close to my house, so it makes it easy to go grab a healthy breakfast when I don't feel like cooking.   Mimi's Cafe has two dining areas, a counter you can eat at, and they also have outside seating. The place always appears to be very clean and the staff is very friendly. I have never had an issue with my food or with the service in the seven years I have been going here.  Mimi's Cafe is a great place for a healthy breakfast. They make egg white omelette's and they have steel cut oats. They have fresh blueberries for your oats too. They also have great steak and eggs. It's not on the menu anymore, but if you ask, they will make it for you.  I have never been here for dinner, but I would bet it as just as good as there breakfast menu.  I highly recommend Mimi's."}
{"text":"Ordered eggs and bacon meal for take out. Comes with muffin and potatoes. I asked to sub the muffin for fruit and asked if they could do something if I didn't want potatoes. They said sure!  We will give you More eggs or bacon. Picked up meal and the fruit was placed inside the food container. Nothing better than hot fruit. Does this look like a $10 breakfast??"}
{"text":"I don't really get this place.   I used to go to Mimi's for breakfast every now & then (not just this one) and always found it to be solid. Nothing spectacular, but a not notch above Denny's & IHOP. And frankly, that's always the impression I thought they were going for...a solid, but not spectacular casual dining spot.   I came to this location recently & realized Mimi's has changed quite a bit from last time I stopped in one (honestly, this review could probably be for any Mimi's, not just this one). I always remember there being a slight French theme to this place, but it seems like they've gone even further now, and have made this even more apparent. I just don't think casual dining like this really lends itself to French (I always think of French restaurants being more quaint...and not chain).   That being said, the breakfast I had was fine. Granted I only had oatmeal & pumpkin muffin (which was quite good). My mom has some sort of mini waffles topped w/apples & bacon, This is where the whole French meets casual dining just seems a little off. She liked them & thought they were tasty, but seeing these little waffles served all \"fancy\" at a causal dining spot just seemed off.   I'd come back though (our service was fine), and next time I guess maybe the initial shock of the \"new\" atmosphere will probably wear off..."}
{"text":"5 cars in the parking lot at 6:15pm is never a good sign. Went directly to the bar to order, was completely ignored for at least 10 min.   Went to the car to call in my order. Spoke to manager who was very apologetic.   Pancakes and waffles are DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at MiMis Cafe, the chef took amazing care of us and my little special requests!!  Augustine was so kind and Checked on our table personally two times!!  Our Waiter was also so courteous Ernesto !! Bravo to the both of you!!! We will be back!!! I may even adopt Augustine!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is great here but dinner...well that's another story. We had one of the most revolting dinners. Even the salad tasted odd and not fresh. The food was bland and tasteless. The waitress was very nice and service was a bit slow.The only bright spot was my son enjoyed his broccoli cheese soup. Skip dinner and enjoy their breakfast instead."}
{"text":"The food was ok nothing great for the money it took a long time to come out. The server was not very good at all.   They forgot some our food. I think they need to work on there service."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and delightful!  We ordered the 2 appetizers,  2 entrées,  and we shared a dessert.  Came out to about $30 (a lot cheaper that we expected) & it was overly crowded when we came to dine (it was a Sunday around 5 pm). We sat on the patio and everything was brought to us just as we were about to finish with the previous course. Try the tomato and basil soup, hands down the best soup I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Had a satisfying breakfast here with a friend. The French toast was perfectly cooked, and my friend's strawberry waffles were excellent. Service was friendly, and we had a coupon for BOGO, which made our meal very reasonable.   The clientele here does seem to be quite a bit older though. The combined age of both me and my friend was still younger than most of the patrons here!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in along time and boy has mimis gone down hill! Wrong info by servers, No Kids meal menus. Long waits even though there is no one waiting at all! I guess that's why it's empty, it's a shame because I really use to like it here. Oh also the menu says fresh oj, the lady said it's actually from concentrate. Why say it on the menu if it's not. Okay at the end the manager gave me free muffins for the long wait. That just added 2 stars. That's the kind of proactive customer loyalty the engenders brand loyalty. Still good memories from childhood will keep me returning."}
{"text":"The menu keeps getting smaller, the prices keep getting higher, and the service hasn't gotten any better.   We called ahead for 11am and walked in at 1050. They didn't seat us until 1120 and we didn't see a waitress for a little over 10 minutes and we ordered right away for fear we wouldn't see her again in a while.   Food was good but took 40 minutes to come out. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Our server Was awesome! I had never been here before and he made a wonderful recommendation! Can't wait to go back and try the apple bacon waffles!"}
{"text":"not that impressed. I really wanted pancakes from ihop but my boyfriend's mom wanted to come here, so had no say. They had 3 pancake selections to choose from - I ordered the lemon poppy seed and wasn't too impressed and the pancake texture was kinda cardboardy. I also wanted a side of hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns are actually potatoes, so that was another disappointment. I also ordered lemondae which tasted pretty weird and watered down. Only food I find impressive here is their bran muffin - it is very tasty with butter. The restaurant itself is nice and clean and nice service, but I am definitely not a fan of their food."}
{"text":"Worst experience. Waitress was exceptionally rude and would not treat us with any modicum of civility. They took forever to get our food out and it was luke-warm and sub-par in quality. My mashed potatoes were very dry and our server was so mean I was uncomfortable mentioning it. Then the manager came out and tried to defend her abhorrent behavior. Everyone there is exceptionally rude and we will never return."}
{"text":"After just spending an hour of my day fixing their mistakes, I'll never be back.  We ordered take-out because I really enjoy their French dip. Today they neglected to give us fries for two of our orders. After driving another 20 mins in the rain, we were handed a handful of fries with no extra forms of customer service. I can understand the mistake at the beginning but there needs to be some sort of customer service to make up for it."}
{"text":"So the food was meh. I ordered my burger extra well-done and received a FLAVORLESS bleeding hunk of beef on a tasteless sourdough thing with rubbery bacon. Nothing had any flavor. My mother and sister got some seafood skewers, they said they were good. My daughter's Mac-n-cheese came out ice cold and there was a film over her mashed potatoes from sitting so long. Pissed me off.   The waitress just seemed frazzled and clueless. She had to come back three times because she forgot what we ordered to drink (There were four of us), refilled my sisters Sprite with water, and didn't provide napkins or silverware until we asked her twice. But she sure brought the check out and took our money with a quickness!   Crappy experience. Won't go back. Food was bland. Service sucked. It was LOUD inside, the dividers between the booths were dusty and the glass had smudges and splashes all over it."}
{"text":"I do like the food here.  The take out Thanksgiving dinner was good.  Some of the customer service is great.   This time the waitress never came back to check on me,  offer more coffee or to see if I wanted my check.  Another time I was by the hostess stand for over 10 minutes.  Even though 5 employees looked  at me no one offered to seat me, or get help.  I give up!"}
{"text":"I got the farmhouse tacos which were good. The service wasn't great. We did have a party of 40, but some of our party never got their food. The wait staff didn't check back to make sure everyone had their food. I don't think I'll be back. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say about Mimi's café other than Bad bad bad it took me over eight minutes to put in a drink water and then I asked for a simple thing ice tea you would think this would be easy unfortunately they serve me sweet tea Needless to say I sent it back 10 minutes later my tea arrive knowing that I ordered iced tea you would think that the waitress would not serve me hot tea but I was served Hot tea this may be a great restaurant for someone in Sun City this looking for a hot cup of tea and a egg white omelette because that seemed to be exactly who was there and may God love them but I don't like hot tea that is why I ask for iced tea anyway I just wanted to paying my check and Run"}
{"text":"This place is really yummy, I had an omelet and it was delicous and so was the mimosa.  My husband had the pumpkin spice pancakes, they were really good too."}
{"text":"Ordered the pot roast and the broccoli was like rubber. Then the waitress was all of a sudden very rude and sassy ASWELL as rushed when there was only a couple full tables."}
{"text":"Big time change in menu.......NOT good, Waitress told us not many people like it!!!.  Options are limited especially if you are vegetarian.  they did agree to fix a pasta for me, which was an OK dish.   Lets face it Mimis is a old timers place and I can't image what they were thinking. Awful choices and guess I'll find another place for comfort food.  Bad move--too many restaurants to choose from in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab lunch! They have great soups and sandwich combos and its got a great vibe inside! Love it and will go back soon."}
{"text":"It is an OK breakfast.  You cant mess up eggs, well maybe.  They are good thought and the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"I'll point out the 'bad' first, and 'good' last.  The menu had lots of variety and selections in the past - no longer.   I suspect that this is why it was so empty for a Saturday night.  I remember wonderful entrees from years ago.  There was nothing on the menu that I could get excited about.  I ordered the Mediterranean Salad with Roasted Chicken.  That chicken was BOILED in water, not roasted. Very ick.  And there wasn't much chicken in it - I had to poke around the salad for a bit to FIND the chicken.  So as far as my entree goes, the grade is a 'D'.  The 'good' is that our service was wonderful, and we had a large party.  Our server gets an 'A+'.  Note to manager:  when you come around to the table to ask if everything is ok, I'm not going to announce in front of everyone that my chicken was boiled for my salad.  Most everyone I know would just politely say that everything was great.  Management \"drive-by's\" are just not effective.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"It can't get much more disappointing than this. I came in here with a good friend for our Valentine's night. Her boyfriend had work; me no girlfriend to speak for. So we figured \"Eh, let's try this new place.\"  From the get go it wasn't too bad - great friendly service with a smile and we were started off with a delicious chocolate red velvet cake muffin that was, as they say, to die for. But from there the service got slow and the food got worse.  I ordered fried seafood platter that was named something like \"Fisherman's Duo\". And I wish I could remember the name exactly to tell you to AVOID it! It was served hot but I was disappointed to see what looked like two hand rolled fish patties battered and fried like glorified fish sticks alongside just FOUR crunchy, overcooked shrimp. I substituted mashed potatoes for fries and those weren't bad. My friend had a salad that looked pretty much plain and basic - I would've been disappointed to be eating that!  Topping it all off the waitress was just so slow getting back to us so we could order our red wine. It ended up taking forever to even get us our wine when we did order it. I'm no connoisseur but I don't think I got the Merlot I asked for either. And at the end of the night we were practically being pushed out the door while finishing the wine they brought out to us so late. The only thing keeping them at 2 stars is that muffin."}
{"text":"Bleh to the max, like oh m'god. I like the carrot raisin bread, but everything else is meh. $50 for two, but in fairness that was because we each added the tomato mozzarella. Unfortunately that tomato mozzarella is a freaking joke. I though they screwed up, but check out my pic. I have it three stars because this place still has decent breakfast food, I think and we were there for dinner."}
{"text":"Laraine was wonderful and had our food out so quick! Got the chipotle burrito and the croissant sandwiches which were both huge portions! Not a huge banana fan but the banana chocolate muffin was amazing!"}
{"text":"Just came here last weekend. Ordered eggs Benedict it was delicious. Service was good even though it was busy."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Bowls with hair, food not fresh, tried to contact the manager by email, fax as the asst. manager could not assist us, ALL WRONG INFO ON THE BUSINESS CARD. Expensive, service not all that great, utensils were crusty/dried food!"}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is very good for breakfast and they serve the best  blueberry muffins.  The service and servers are very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of this restaurant. Great Staff and excellent \"bang for your buck\". If you love home style cooking then this is a must for you."}
{"text":"You know how you keep giving a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, figuring well maybe the cook wasn't feeling good, so you excuse the food not being up to par.  Well enough is enough, no wonder they send out coupons for \"Buy one entrée get the other free\", because if they didn't no one would be eating there,  even with the coupon, the food still costs more than its worth because you have to have 2 beverages.  If they are not running out of the food you order, they serve the food lukewarm, the dish they put in front of you is sloppy, not at all like the picture of it on the menu.  Taste there isn't any, temperature of the food, lukewarm, is it eatable? yes, but when you go out to eat you want to enjoy yourself and you most certainly cannot enjoy yourself at this Mimi's nor at the Ft. Apache & Charleston Mimi's which is located near the Boca Park Shopping Center.   We've been to both of them, the one on Stephanie St. in Henderson, thought maybe a change of location would bring about a change in the food, NO, same stuff, waste of time, waste of money and most importantly your stomach isn't in a happy place after you leave Mimi's.  Terrible, how no one in upper management takes the time to figure out the problem, make sure the food tastes and looks like its supposed to and most importantly have it available, not say \"We just ran out\".... how is it possible to  \"run out\" of food, no matter what you order.  I especially like the fact they tell you Wednesday is not a good night to eat at Mimi's because their delivery truck comes in on Thursday and so they are low on everything.  So order more so you have food on Wednesday.  Why does the customer have to know your delivery schedule in order to eat at your restaurant???  Very disappointing...... don't print the coupons it is not worth what you are paying for what you are actually eating...... sad but true........"}
{"text":"Great food, great price. Latte's are great, breakfast muffins are huge, burgers are delicious, great service."}
{"text":"Bleech. Welcome to the chain that Sysco loves. If you love uninspired, bland, boring food that helps give chain restaurants their hated reputation you've found the right place. If you like waits due to slow or no service this is your place. If you really want to see someone try and create a faux New Orleans environment and come up woefully short at the feeble attempt, this is your place. About the closest this would come to New Orleans would be Slidell, LA style. Slidell is a small city just North of Lake Pontchartrain and I'll just leave that slam hanging...  I would much rather eat late 1970's high school cafeteria food than be forced to choke down what is served here. And if you want a \"New Orleans\" experience with your food you're better off finding your closest Popeye's Chicken for something that's Louisiana fast vs. the stuff they bring to your table, which in the case of this Henderson location is usually: A: Cold  B: Not what you ordered C: Overpriced for what you get. Pick 2 of those choices on almost every visit.   How this chain has proliferated is a testament to Sysco's ability to keep bulk food prices down, and for people to tolerate crappy food and even crappier service.   In short, you would be better off scouring Yelp for the absolute worst Las Vegas casino buffet and going there vs. eating here. At least there's Walgreens and CVS's close by for the Pepto and Tagamet you'll need after the fact. And as I'm writing this I realized it's not far from the Mongolian grill that made me sick too. Is there something about the East side of Stephanie, just South of Sunset that is destined to have crappy food? I'm beginning to wonder."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I've ever been to Mimi's and it was pretty good,  I got chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes and it was yummy, especially the chicken.  Not too fancy but a nice place to sit and have a pretty good meal.  Good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love Mimi's!  The food is always wonderful, hot and consistent.  We don't live in the area any longer but decided to stop in for breakfast the other day. Just as we remembered.  GREAT! The server Monica did an amazing job... Very nice and took good care of us!  We also had a chance to meet the manager Michael.  He really knows how to be a team leader! It's not very often you see that in managers! Great Job Mimi's! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate went there for breakfast. We got their Buttermilk pancakes with eggs and sausage and a cup of  not so tasty coffee. We couldn't even eat the pancakes, they were so thick and doughy. We couldn't eat them. The waitress did give us some complimentary croissants which were very delicious. The restaurant is nice and the service was descent, we will probably give it another try."}
{"text":"We finally tried this new place the food (Breakfast) & drinks (mimosas) are so good and to top it off the waiter LeRoy and manager were so friendly and awesome! Definitely will be back again!  #FreeMuffins #A1 #Delicious"}
{"text":"We had visited Mimi's in November of 2017 and back again in February of 2018.  Again, great service, great food, pleasant atmosphere.  Real classic American menu, which was fine with us.  Gratifying to have the same waiter (James!!) this time around that we had the last time!  Huge style and he really hustled to make sure we were happy.  Oh, one last thing that I REALLY appreciated.  This is NOT a noisy restaurant.  Huge plus."}

You are the last to get service, empty glasses, waitress ha Ok would have been nice to see her more then once.  Thanks for bringing my toast out after I finished my eggs....usually people dip toast in their dippy eggs."}
{"text":"We had a great server named Herschel who definitely gave exemplary service. The food was delicious and the ambiance was cool and inviting. I would definitely come back to this establishment, and I'll be sure to let people know to stop by. If you ever come by be sure to ask for Herschel, he's definitely funny, knowledgeable and provides great service."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe is a delightful food experience. Debbie our server was superb and made our breakfast extra delicious with some excellent  non-carb options for my breakfast. She was attentive and efficient. We will be back."}
{"text":"Decent enough place to come for breakfast if you're tired of eating at the buffetts and fast food restaurants.   The steak and eggs are good and the crepes aren't bad either. The omelets leave sonething to be desired, maybe because they aren't fluffy and full. But all-in-all, it's an okay place."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $42. Paid $22. BOGO coupon from joining their email club, free birthday dessert, and asked to split our meals so they came on 4 total plates and it felt like we got 2.5 meals instead of just 2, not pictured- the delicious bread basket.  Excellent service from management too!! We went at night and the only issue was that they didn't have chicken pot pie prepped and told me it would be a 30 minute wait to get so I ordered something else. Since it was night time it wasn't super busy"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Strip and just kept having bad food experiences. So I said, let's go to Mimi's. This one was at least a 20-30 minute drive using the freeway. We get there and it's 9:25 but they close at 10. I deducted a star because no one greeted us for at least 5 mins or longer. One girl just kept looking at us and refused to say anything.  Girl bye!  I had to go to the bathroom so I said screw it and just went to relieve myself.  When I came out my party was finally seated.  Only reason we stayed is because I knew the food would be delicious. Who has time for bad food in Vegas? Not me.  I ordered brie appetizer, my wife ordered french pot roast and I think my mom had corn soup with pot roast to go.  The food was soooo good. Make sure you get some muffins to go. We got a 4 pack and ate them as breakfast the next couple of days in Vegas. Really delicious and a good buy. Great alternative to some of the places on the strip. Affordable. Maybe we paid $55 for all 3 of us to eat and have food to go.  Super yummy. Thank God for chain restaurants."}
{"text":"The server wasn't helpful at all, we told her it's our first time, she never mentioned kids eat free or brought kids menu, I got up to ask her for more water. Rice was flavorless and linguine wasn't al dente. Every table was with bread except ours, Horrible experience. I'll never come back to waste my time or money. Thanks Kelly!"}
{"text":"Had the burger with bacon and fried egg was so tasty that I tried eating it all, I tired. The wife had the turkey club and of course that was bomb with avocado. So full still want more come and get yr grub on at Mimis Cafe it's a yummy time in yr tummy. Ha"}
{"text":"Love the frites menu with the chicken, steak or salmon.  Sign up for the e mail club and get BOGO coupons.  Chicken crepes are delish."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have only been here once before a couple years ago for my birthday. We chose to go again for dinner as opposed to brunch the first time. I got the meatloaf and my husband got the chicken and shrimp jambalaya. We got Mac and cheese w/ fries for our son. The bread to start off with was delicious and I love that they don't keep bringing more and more bread like other restaurants. The bread completely satisfied us. My husband and I shared our dinners and the portion sizes were perfect enough for us to actually get dessert and enjoy it without getting overly full. The waitress was nice and attentive. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday evening after 7:00 pm with my man.  The place was busy but not crowded.  We were seated right away in a lovely booth by a window.   I loved the decor and ambiance.  Everyone there seemed to be enjoying themselves.  This was our first time here (we had a gift card).  We told our server this and he let the general manager know.  She came by our table several times to make sure we were enjoying our experience and we really appreciated that.    I never knew the place had a French theme.  I heard \"cafe\" and figured it would have diner food, like a Denny's.  The food is much more fancy than a diner.  The food is French-inspired, so this was a new experience for us.  The menu is in English but the food titles are in French.  That made my man a little nervous but we pressed on.  My husband and I are kind of picky eaters so there weren't a lot of options that we liked but we did manage to find something delicious.    They have a great deal - 2 for $25.  Two appetizers, two entrees & a dessert trio to share.  The have a fixed menu of items to choose from with this deal.  This worked out well for us.  We were stuffed by the end of our meal and had half of our entree to take home.  Appetizers:  French Onion Soup for me, Caesar Salad for my man  --  We both loved our appetizers.  The French onion soup was thick and scrumptious, with nice amount of onions, a slice of baguette and dreamy melted cheese on top.  My man's Caesar salad looked very nice and he liked it very much.  I will post pics of these.  Entrees:  We both got the French Dip with mozzarella added, along with fries -- The French Dip was very tasty, nicely sized and a good amount of meat.  The fries were  standard fare but tasty.  Dessert:  The dessert is a trio, Cinnamon Apple Crisp with ice cream on top, Bread Pudding and a warm brownie with ice cream on top. -- The Cinnamon Apple Crisp is divine!  I want to go back just for that.  The brownie was good too, nothing special but nice with the ice cream.  Bread pudding must be an acquired taste.  Not a fan but I'm sure some of you will love it.  I give this place 4 stars because I am a fan.  The food was tasty and our server was super nice and very attentive.  If you like French-inspired food then this place is for you.  If this place gets a more diverse menu it might get that extra star."}
{"text":"It's my 2nd time here and was dissapointed. It seems that the menu got smaller and I wasn't really satisfied with the meal. Ordered salad and a sandwich. Salad was ok but sandwich was dissapointing, kind of lacked flavor. The fries were good at least. And the bread for appetizer was good as well. I enjoyed my first visit more. Service is very good and fast."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and never disappointed. The food  has always been tasty and service has been great. My family enjoys coming here and the food has been great. I'm not sure why the other reviews are so low. This place has always did well with me and my family."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Mimis cafe. They have horrible customer service but pretty decent food and great coupons. So, I keep returning.  Dont expect to get your bread in a timely fashion, and do not expect to have a knowledgeable server. Do, however, expect to have yummy food. May I suggest blackened Monterey Chicken Sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries? Any muffin is a must.  Sign up for their e-club and you will receive weekly coupons. Typically buy one entree get one free which is convenient for you and a friend. They let me show them the coupon via phone, dont waste your computer ink."}
{"text":"This review is for their service. My boyfriend and I came here for brunch, our waitress was rude and it took literally 20 minutes to bring out our 2 Mimosas!!! 20 Minutes!!!! And this was after asking her to check on them twice. Then the manager comes over and unwittingly asks \"how are the mimosas?\" I said well they are good other than they took 20 minutes to come out. He asked if he could give us a free muffin to make up for it. I said no, how about a second round of mimosas. He told me \"Well i cant do that.\" And walked away!!! Terrible service!!!!@"}
{"text":"Ok well Mimi's have changed their menu drastically and there are not many options, they actually have more options for wine then they do food.  They also increased their prices substantially.  They added more muffin flavors and they are always good.  Plus the bread plate which comes out when you sit down is very flavorful.  We had two salads and they were great.  One salad came out missing a few ingredients, but they quickly rectified the situation.  We came in on a Monday night and the place was empty!!!  Pretty good place to go for some quality food, how can you screw up a salad and muffins. But definitely not what it used to be in there hey day."}
{"text":"The place is amazing,great service Augustine took care of us  he was the best, we got to take 2 muffins for free it was a gift for first time customers,thank you ."}
{"text":"Great muffins. Service could be better. Unfortunately had to remind server twice to bring a cup of coffee. Service is usually good. Great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this location!  Every single visit we are greeted and seated quickly, our food comes out perfectly and with very little wait.  All of our severs are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and the managers are always available and helpful.    Tiffany, a host, is an absolutely sweetheart.  She knows our favorite spot and always finds the time to have a small chat with us.  Even if we hated everything else about this location (which is utterly impossible), her friendliness alone would be enough to keep us as regulars.  Thanks for all the great meals, Stephanie crew!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, we dined here 2 days in a row recently. Kyra and Carla were our servers and we had a good experience with both. First day I added corn chowder cup of soup ($2.49 additional charge), second day I added tomato basil soup and that one was my favorite. Saturday night was busy but it is still quiet enough to have a conversation. Overall a good place for dinner."}
{"text":"I am only giving it one extra star since the manager gave us a freebie. However, the free item was horrible.  We arrived and patiently stood while we watched 5 people, who all arrived after us, get seated before us. Why? They were older, looked hungrier, or had better clothing. I don't really know. We seemed to be see through as nobody acknowledged our existence for a while. \"Have you been taken care of?\" Um- no. So our freebie was the 4 cheese grease trough spinach artichoke dip served with 10 corn tortilla chips. The dip was greasy. I know, it's cheese, but the grease was encircling the serving bowl. Microwaved maybe? Whatever happened to it, it was rather gross. The 10 chips served with it? We didn't even finish them. But really, a few more for theatrics would have been nice. Food was good looking, but taste was bland and dry. I had the roasted turkey 1/2 sandwich. You really should not have to drown your food in mayo to be able to swallow it. French onion soup was tasty. Service. Hmm. I will try to be nice. The waitress seemed to be bothered by us. I almost thought she gave me a dirty look when she had to refill my drink, but that must have been my mistake? when she brought the bill, I think she threw it at me as she recited the \"have a nice day and I will be your cashier when.....\" I don't know what the rest was as she was saying it while back turned to us and walking away.  My suggestion is to go next door to Ajo Al's."}
{"text":"While visiting with family in Las Vegas, we decided to have breakfast at Mimi's since my uncle recommended it. We were not disappointed, the food and service were great! The pumpkin spice pancakes were awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh Mimi's Cafe! How you never let us down?!  This store is in the same section of the arroyo crossings center as chilis, party city&bahama bucks!  My boyfriend and I have lived up the street from this local favorite for 3 years. We haven't been in a few months because we kept going 2x a week so there was a Mimi's overload.   My favorite is lunch, it's quick and includes a cup of soup or a side salad alongside your meal. The lunch menu pretty much has gourmet sandwiches ready in a matter of minutes for those on a quick lunch.   Breakfast muffins are always amazing too! Keep a lookout for coupons in the mail.  Sometimes they're really worth it.  15 off 30 bucks  That's what I'm talkin about!!  Service is always very fast and friendly.   Haven't been in awhile but they never fail us."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd and final time eating at Mimi's Cafe.  Please keep in mind also that I was not aware that this was a chain restaurant either.  My sister and I decided to have dinner here.  Now I am not expecting the restaurant staff to roll out a red carpet because I have deemed their establishment the place I want to eat, but could they at least be friendly and act as though they care we are eating there?    The hostesses were extremely friendly, we were sat almost instantly.  The server on the other hand was another story.  She was not friendly at all.  As mentioned I had only eaten here one other time so I was a little confused on what came with the mean, you know soup or salad and then desert at the end for what ever price.  She came off rather rude because she had to explain it to me and then had to throw in \"WELL I am not sure how long ago you were last here but that is how this has always been!!\"  I was just confused because I thought you could choose either an appetizer or a desert....only because that is what happened the last time I was there.    Apparently they no longer bring you the bread basket, you actually have to ask for it which I find strange.  She did take our drink order and I was happy that they came promptly; however, we sat for 20 minutes waiting for her to come back to take our actual food order....we were sitting there with empty glasses at this point.    She did come back with more drinks and bread, no apology for making us wait for that length of time, and no the place was not that packed.  When we thanked her for bring refills and bread she just turned around and walked away.  No \"your welcome\" or no \"my pleasure\", I mean come on we thanked you, the least you could do is say you are welcome right?   Someone else brought us our food, I was very disappointed, I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, the chicken breast was very thin and extremely tiny.  The sauce tasted as though someone hit up the Asian isle at Walmart and emptied an entire bottle top of some brown rice and some overly cooked vegetables.  By the this time our drinks needed to be refilled someone brought over tea, we thanked her, she just turned away never saying your welcome.   No one came over to see how the food was, I actually overheard a couple asking another server what was good there to eat, that server actually said \" I do not know I am new here, I just moved like last week, so I will give you a few minutes and come back to you\"  I personally think, especially since I have worked in restaurants, EVEN if you do not know, find something that people have actually commented on, or people order a lot.  I think it looks bad if the staff cannot offer up a suggestion and even if she really did not know, JUST PICK SOMETHING LOL!!    The manager made his way into the area where we were sitting and took a view of the room, I thought he would actually thank people for coming in, or ask how their food was, but nope, he just looked around like he forgot where he was and how he got there and then left.     My sister ordered the Squash Ravioli and shrimp, it was actually really good.  I really wished I would have ordered that instead.  The next time our server came to the table was guess when?????? BINGO when it was time to drop off the check and that is when she seem to be a little more friendly!  I never understood why bad servers actually think that being nice at the very end of the meal is going to erase my memory of all the horrible service they provided before they dropped off the check?!!  As we were leaving she never even said, \"Thanks for coming in, or Happy Holiday's or Have a Great Night \"  Upon leaving I did inform the hostess that our server was terrible and i would not be eating here again, all she said was \"Sorry\""}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but this was the best breakfast I've had in recent memory.   We came on a Monday morning around 10:30 AM and it was not very busy yet but started to fill up for lunch.  Let's start with the croissants. I like them and I eat them as often as I can from many different places. In all my life, this was the best croissant I've ever had. Get a croissant. Do it. Even if you don't think you like croissants. Even if you have high cholesterol. Even if you're gluten intolerant, like me. Oops. #iregretnothing  The griddlecakes were the perfect amount of sweet and fluffy.   The breakfast tacos were yummy - I love the idea of corn tortillas in a street-style taco.  The ham and Swiss crepes are my sister's favorite new food.  And the potatoes - these are great. They do mini white potatoes that were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The skins on them cause them to pop in your mouth in a delightful way. I love love love them!  The server was attentive without being intrusive and kept our cups full and brought the food quickly.  I will try to come to this restaurant every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This one made my list of worst service experiences, without a doubt. It's a shame too, because our first visit was great, but the second a few week later? Total opposite. So bad, in fact, that it more than offset the earlier visit.   So what happened? Well, first we showed up late, say around 8pm, to get some dinner. I was hoping for the \"all day breakfast\" selection that they have, but as soon as I cracked open the menu I was horribly disappointed to find out that it was no longer there. Instead, I settled on their seasonal three-course meal thing, where you get a soup, a main course and a mini-dessert. Sounded practical and looked better than the other menu offers (I couldn't find anything else I was remotely interested in, having sat down with a breakfast craving). My wife opted for a barbeque burger, she had no intention of going the breakfast route so the menu change was of no consequence to her.   So the food arrives, first the bread basket and my soup. The bread was so/so, but the french rolls that came as part of it were warm on the outside and ice cold on the inside. Obviously didn't heat these babies up enough after they came out of the freezer. Nothing worse than biting into warm bread and finding it still frozen inside, or so I thought. Then I tried the soup, which was supposed to be a tomato basil bisque. I kept thinking to myself that it felt a little too hot, but couldn't tell at first it was temperature hot or spicy hot. Turned out upon closer inspection, there are flakes of chili pepper floating in there, green and red ones. What in the holy heck? Who makes spicy tomato soup? It was absolutely revolting and I didn't eat anymore of it, leaving it at least 3/4 full for the server when she returned. She offered to bring something else, but I was afraid of how they would have butchered the other soups, so I opted to save my now waning appetite for the main course.   Main course arrives, chicken with mushroom sauce. Tastes OK but not great. I notice the plate, however, is dirty underneath on all four sides, and not recently either. It was dried, caked on food stains, at least a day old. Really made me question whether or not I should have eaten the food on the top side of the plate. I don't know how the server didn't feel it when she brought the plate out, it was all over the bottom and there was no way to miss it unless you were just plain clueless. I picked it up the second I touched the plate to move it, which is why I looked underneath to see what was going on. As for my wife, her burger was OK but not great either. When she got towards the center, it was still very pink, despite asking for well done. That was a deal breaker for her, so she didn't finish the other half of it.   Dessert was another lesson in disgusting food. The bread pudding dish was basically a soggy, nasty piece of what used to be bread, floating in this ridiculously sweet, bright yellow sauce that only vaguely tasted like butterscotch or something. I have no idea what it was, but it was horrible. We didn't even put a dent in that thing, not even a full bite.   Naturally, our server was completely clueless. No attention to the half eaten burger, the dessert that was nibbled and left for dead, or the general unhappiness at our table. When she returned with the bill for me to leave my tip and sign the receipt, she capped off our wonderful experience by giving me a pen that had been completely destroyed. There was ink all over it and, what's worse, it wouldn't write even when I tried to use it in a desperate attempt to just end the experience and get out of there. I waited a full ten minutes and watched her and several other servers and their manager ignore us completely, never coming back to see why we hadn't left or signed the check or anything. I ended up having to ask the girl at the front of the restaurant, who was cleaning, if I could get a pen from her since our server never came back and I wanted to sign the receipt. With no apology and no effort to find the server or a manager she gave me a pen and I promptly scratch out a less than generous tip and returned her pen to walk out.   Icing on the cake? She asked my wife and I how everything was. I told her it was \"okay, I guess\" and she asks what happened. I told her that, as I had just said, our server gave me a broken, leaking pen and never returned for 10 minutes or more so I had to get up and go find a pen to sign the check with. She didn't make any sincere apology and let us walk away.   Absolutely ridiculous service, ruined soup, ice cold bread, undercooked burger, dirty plates, regurgitated dog-food dessert and then a yucky, leaking, non-functional pen to sign the receipt with? Are you kidding me? This one definitely makes my list of horrific restaurant experience for the year. I am never going back to this place."}
{"text":"This Mimi's Cafe is pretty dated It didn't bother me too much but I just thought I would throw that out there The carpet is pretty old The decor is charming  The food and service were pretty good We had a feeling it would be a bit busier on a Sunday morning and when we got there, we were informed there would be a 5-10 minute wait, fine with us  We were seated in a booth and offered menus and drink orders I got water and grapefruit juice and I love the grapefruit juice and the cup it came in  Our server was pretty busy as she had a huge section to cover but she did her best to get around to us and everyone else...  As far as food, the menu is pretty small but it seems like Mimi's has updated their options... Not that I knew their menu before but it just seemed up to date in comparison to other restaurants... I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with a side of potatoes... I love croissant sandwiches so I was excited... Our meal took about 20 minutes to get to us but I am very patient...  The croissant sandwich was very, very good. The croissant bread it self was divine! Very warm, flaky, and absolutely great! It was the perfect combination of ham, egg, and tomato. I really enjoyed the sandwich. The potatoes were yummy too, great flavor. I was impressed by Mimi's...   I put aside the dated inside decor and let the food speak for the restaurant and it was great! Can't wait to try their lunch menu... They have a nice cocktail selection that I have to tackle...  Tip- be prepared for long lines/waits on Saturday and Sunday mornings..."}
{"text":"Everyone here was very friendly and the food was great. I was in a party of three and we got all got different food items and they were all great. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back to try more of the dishes, the menu was so mouthwatering it took me forever to decide what to order."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is always great, their loyalty program is awesome. We have been very happy with the food, service, curbside pickup etc. I just don't have anything bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"This place is a winner! We are new to the centennial hills area and were going to eat at Babystacks this past Sunday because it's the only breakfast place we knew about in the area but the wait was over 30 minutes and we just didn't have the time to wait. I am so glad we couldn't because we found Mimi's, a new favorite. Our waitress I believe Danielle was great, attentive, and on top of things. She even brought us two muffins to take with us since it was our first time visiting. On to the food... To start our waitress brought us a basket of little muffin loafs of their carrot raisin muffins, so moist and delicious! I had the griddle cakes and they were fantastic! Much better than Babystacks in my opinion for buttermilk pancakes. My husband had the turkey, mushroom, and Brie crepes with the potatoes and he said they were really good. The griddle cakes were huge but so good I couldn't stop eating them. They came with a side of fruit, bacon, and eggs. We will definitely be returning actually tomorrow since my mom is coming into town!"}
{"text":"Went to Mimi's to try something new and was pleasantly surprised. Good food, good portion size and good waitress. I eat like a bird and generally take everything home and this was no exception for me. I feasted on the left overs for days.   I like Mimi's and will be returning to try breakfast. I liked the decor and atmosphere as well. Overall had a good experience and felt like I got my moneys worth."}
{"text":"Potential but just OK.  Booth is comfortable.  Waiter is friendly.  Keeps refilling my coke.  Food is OK but could be so much better.  Their niche is serving non-traditional chain food.  I didn't want anything with fries or potatoes so I gave them a try remembering they served quiche years ago.  I ordered the corn chowder with scallops and the crab cakes with micro-greens.  Crab cakes very good.  Chowder had been on simmer for too long and scallops were rubbery.  I would order the crab cakes with just a cup of chowder (no scallops) next time.  I'm going to go back and try the quiche next time."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices too.  My favorite place for Sunday breakfast after chuch.  If you sign up on their website they send you couplons for 2 for 1 all the time.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"We love it here, there are so many choices. Try the cinnamon roll French toast, you won't be sorry.  The ambience is adorable and the service has never been less than stellar.  If you're not sure what you're hungry for  you'll find it here."}
{"text":"If we saw all the negative reviews before going, we probably wouldn't have gone. We were in the area and stopped by Tuesday for lunch. The line was literally out the door. Because we were willing to dine at the bar we were seated right away otherwise the wait was 15-20 minutes.   I ordered the lunch combo w/ tomato bisque soap and a turkey, brie & cranberry sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. The fries were limp and soggy. Gross, right? My hubby got the french onion soup and marseilles (sp) crepe stuffed with chicken, sun dried tomato and topped with some sort of mushroom gravy. My tomato soup was REALLY good. I only wish they had basil whipped in there. My sandwich was not bad, they put too much cranberry relish on it, I just scraped it off. My husband's dish had too much of an ingredient, couldn't put my finger on it, but again it wasn't bad. I didn't get a chance to taste all of the french onion soup because he ate all the cheese before I could get to it, The broth was fine.  The service was fine to me. Although, I thought it was strange when the waitress brought out his soup first then asked me if I wanted mine now or when my meal came. I want my soup when my dining companion has their soup. Weird.  Overall, the experience was pleasant not worth waiting 15-20 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Friday night and the place was slow.   Server was not that quick.  Muffins were cold.   I had salmon and it tasted fishy and bland.   He had the meatloaf and could've gotten better at a cafeteria.  Really just blah.    Was disappointed bc every other Mimi's I have visited (Greenville & atlanta) has always been great.  Don't recommend this place.   Food was bland and unimpressive.   The only good thing... $5 glasses of wine all day."}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly service had the chicken and waffle with a side of scrambled eggs. Eggs were a bit over cooked, the chicken had a good flavor and the waffles were so lite and fluffy"}
{"text":"Worst service error. From sitting down to leaving over 2 hours. Food came cold on a few plates and to top it off, when I asked for more ice tea, the waitress said \"You just have to wait\"  It wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"I am still on the fence about the \"new\" menu.  I miss several of the appetizers and reduced selection.  Yesterday the food was above average, with the mussels and onion soup standing out.  The service during this visit earned the fourth star.  The waitress was not very talkative or cheerful, but dang did she make sure refills were prompt and dishes were cleared.  We will be back.  The only complaint is that we had a BOGO free coupon and they took off the lowest item of three entrees, instead of the second highest priced item.  I could have contested that, but I didn't want to fight over $3.  Next time I will, the coupon was for equal or lesser value, not the cheapest."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  On one hand they have one of the most delicious salads I've ever eaten with all my favorite stuff in it.  The \"Bleu Cheese & Walnut Salad\" has dried cranberries, tomatoes, strawberries & balsamic vinaigrette dressing on a bed of mixed greens...  and it comes with a muffin.  It's just awesome.  Dang, I want one now.  *drools a little*  The downside is that the restaurant itself is one of those kitchy, family-friendly chains with garish, faux-French crap littering the walls.  Really, it's just too much.   Eating here makes me feel like such a tool.  What's the solution?  Get it to go!  I can place an order for my coveted salad and walk out the door with it 5-10 minutes later to be eaten wherever I please.  Sweet!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat for lunch and dinner, The food is average, the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"I finally dined here for the first time on Sunday, and it seems like a nice place.  Has a nice homely feel to it, and the menu has many choices.  Service was good, and they also have a bar area to sit at as well.  I had a hard time deciding what to get, so I went with the chicken fingers appitizer.  Portions were good, and service was nice.  I would feel safe taking my parents here, or a friend for a nice quiet meal."}
{"text":"I'm not really a Mimi's fan but my husband had never been so we decided to come here for brunch. Food was excellent and our server was very attentive. I'm not giving 5 stars because, I think it was the lead server or something, was literally screaming at the other servers calling them lazy and insulting them so loudly that myself and other customers went silent and were staring. Treating employees poorly results in poor service, it's probably why some of them were in such bad moods."}
{"text":"I think the food is always really delicious, especially their muffins.  Every single muffin is incredible but especially the carrot raisin. The service can be hit or miss but it's never poor. They're usually very busy on weekends so obviously be ready for that but I've never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I got the Easter dinner.  It was so amazing better than I could have ever made it. And for the  price so worth it. All food was seasoned perfectly. The strawberry walnut feta salad with their homemade vinaigrette to perfect. And the sauce for the ham marmalade.  Scalloped potatoes perfect."}
{"text":"Jen p rocks! Every monday I love to come hang out and have lunch at mimis. I always have a hard time deciding what to eat cause everything is so tasty, so it all depends what im in the mood for. Like today I had the delicious veggie burger and last week I had the monterey omlet. All very good. And the pamosas are awesome. Oj pomagrante juice and champagne. So tasty!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Arrived around 8:10 and there were a few tables filled but it was not busy by any means.  We were greeted quickly and the waiter explained the specials. That's when the experience started going downhill.  We waited for approximately 35 minutes to get Luke warm burgers.  The fries were hot though.  While waiting I accidentally knocked my water glass over and another waiter heard and saw it, but did not react until I yelled for assistance.  Then, my water glass stayed empty for another 15 minutes as I waited for our waiter to fill it up.  When ordering I asked for a side salad and the cost, the waiter said $2.99 and I added it to my order, fully expecting to get fries with the burger and no mention from our waiter if I preferred fries or salad or both.  When the food arrived there was no fries. When I mentioned this, the waiter was quick to bring fries.  Had to ask for more water refill and the table had no napkins or silverwear, which we had to ask for.  So... This morning I get a text from my buddy who dined with me that he had been up all night vomiting and with diarrhea from food poisoning.  Won't go back here"}
{"text":"The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service. HOWEVER, today was a different story. I wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it went....actually it didnt go anywhere...  we walked in and were greeted by a young man when 2 seconds later sam came over and they ignored us and started bickering in front of us. Then i told the guy we wanted to sit outside and he had to ask same which i didnt understand why considering the restaurant was nearly empty. As we were waiting for him to return, another waitress asked if we were being helped and at the point same and the guy were walking back to us bickering. Finally, we were being taken to the outside seating area when I heard sam mutter something. So rude. When we were finally seated, the table was dirty! WTF! it wasnt busy so i dont get WHY they had any dirty tables! So the guy who seated us was gonna go get a bus boy to clean it, we waited for about 10 minutes, when tito came and questioned my english. First off, I dont want to be greeted with \"YO\", I am not your homeboy, second, there wasnt enough people for us to be called \"y'all\". It was annoying, so when we told him NO we arent ready to order because our table wasnt cleaned off, he told us he was gonna go get someone else to do it. At that point, we were irritated and just got up and left.   Looking at most of these reviews, I dont understand why management doesnt fix this service issue. All you have to do is hire servers that have high school diplomas and BAM! problem solved."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Breakfast is huge here...lots of different things to get. You get free bread if you ask the waiter. Manager makes sure everything was good. Food was spot in. Alot of food.Will go again for sure.  Prices Average is 10.50 a plate."}
{"text":"Tried the place in Reno it was yummy we both had the chicken  pot pie,crust was perfect. We live in Vegas and thought wanna try it again? We both had salads. Bread was undercooked and gummy. Chowder was fantastic,onion soup was plain and the onions where not soft. It was a beef broth with onions. The salad was Cobb and Cesar. The Cobb was a fail also. Our waiter was nice and he did ask if things where alright. I told my man its not our waiter's fault. We won't go again."}
{"text":"Very good food at moderate price.  Homemade muffins are GREAT.  Quiet atmosphere.  My favorite waiter is Bill but all are good."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant food.  It's consistent, which can be a good thing if you're not in the mood for surprises either way.  However, mood or not, I was surprised at this particular Mimi's.  Not that my Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs with OJ and Coffee was spectacular, but the service level was amazingly stellar!  Kudos to the wait staff as I left there appetite sated, and feeling oddly good about myself too.  =)"}
{"text":"Mimi's gives a 10% military discount.  Ate lunch here in late December.  Cheeseburger was average.  Tomato basil soup and Chopped Cobb salad are both very good.   We just about fell out of our chairs when the waitress asked a gal at the table behind us if she'd \"like a box for her muffin?\"  Priceless."}
{"text":"Mimi's has pretty good food.  I was impressed with the young host staff going out of their way to adhere to the greet standards - opening the doors for arriving and departing guests.  I was waiting for a table on the patio to be cleaned in the foyer and listened to them engage in positive and appropriate restaurant banter amongst each other.    I will say that I did have to wait for the rest of my party for a good half an hour (I was early) but during that time, and the entire time during our meal, there was a table that remained dirty and un-bussed.   I know there are bussers there but I watched the server walk past the table with an empty tray several times.  That's a teachable moment.   Our server was mediocre at best.  Time management and organization was not her forte - I think she was relatively new to serving in general.  That won't stop me from going back though..."}
{"text":"Have been here many times. Ate here today. It seems their quality with their quantity has gone down. They use to serve larger portions. Food was better. Service is still great. A 3 because size and quality is a big factor in all this."}
{"text":"Every time I go, the food is always excellent. The service has never been a problem. I love it. Besides the quiche, which i order a lot, the French beef roast is superb. Of course the turkey dinner is always good also.."}
{"text":"100+ reviews and this is my worst.  Dinner at Mimi's Cafe is an experience -- a very dull disappointing experience, at least at this branch.  I hope other locations are better, but I am beginning to think that the brain trust at Mimi's corporate central has a disdain for salt, pepper, or any other spice.  For example, my pot roast dinner, including a mixture of carrots and broccoli and a scoop of mashed potatoes, all heaped on one half of the plate, contained not a jot of taste.  The gelatenous brown \"gravy\" that was slobbered wholesale on the mashed potatoes and pot roast was a miracle -- how could they have managed to take the salt OUT of canned gravy?  Or did they actually make it themselves ... on purpose???  My wife's meal (chicken crepes) was just as bad.  The corn chowder did, I admit, have a little seasoning, but it was the thickness of school paste and tasted much the same.  The pork sliders had a sweet BBQ sauce, but the pork itself was mush.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable, and the service proper but distant and not very attentive.  But the food is the big problem here.  I hope the cook staff at this Mimis is just ignorant, uncaring, or hungover, because otherwise there is no hope whatsoever for this chain.  Note:  I have also eaten at Mimi's for breakfast several times.  Although better than dinner, Mimi's breakfasts are pretty ordinary.  The bakery items are, in general, better than the egg dishes, pancakes and waffles -- all of which are bland.  The muffins that accompany most meals are a cut above average."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Decided to go there, having never had a bad meal there for a decent price.  Apparently I jinxed it.   Off to a good start with bistro three course meal. Two of us  ordered from it, good selection and reasonable add on's.  Took server a long time to take our order, and she didn't bring bread until after the soup & salads. Really, first time we didnr't get it soon after being seated.  We have some food allergies. Really stressed to leave them off the plate. She  got it right with the salad. Short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree.  Steak cooked wrong, under temp. Burgundy mushroom sauce the worst I've ever  had. It was more white than burgundy and white onions totally raw. I would never order it again. Main entree a grilled or sauted fish, not breaded, didn't need tartar sauce.  I would go back only to order dishes that have been good in the past. If we were to get this server again, I'd ask to move.  Maybe I watch too much Hell's Kitchen and Masterchef, but these mistakes were cooking 101."}
{"text":"I don't typically go to chains for brunch but I was pleasantly surprised with Mimi's. Service was good and accommodating. I wouldn't say they were as good as other independent brunch restaurants... but overall, i had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Basic, nothing to rave about; Waitress was friendly Decor and seating was mostly clean and basic for a standard place like this-  nothing really to wow about but nothing to complain about either-  we took a couple muffins to go since we were leaving town and those were good, kept their softness and freshness for several hours until we enjoyed them.  All in all- it's basic average."}
{"text":"Breakfast is great, especially with their freshly-baked muffins (available all day)!"}
{"text":"We like Mimi's for breakfast.  The smoked ham and eggs are really good!  Their orange juice is only $1.49 compared to Cracked Egg and Pancake House who both charge like $3.99 for a glass!!  Highway robbery!!  I could buy two gallons at the store for that.  Plus they do a buy-on-get-one-free entree coupon on their website quite a bit.  A good place to go for a quiet conversation with a friend and not noisy."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the food but our server Danniell was so on it!! She's great! If you eat there, request to sit in her section."}
{"text":"Mimi's used to be one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  But the last two times I have been I have been less than impressed.  Today I ordered the salmon with the Dijon Chardonnay sauce, fresh Spinach and frites. Sauce sounded so interesting but it turned out to be a very poor pairing to go with Salmon!  The sauce was more like a gravy in consistency and I could detect no trace of Dijon in the flavors.   They describe the fries as being double fried but these did not taste that way.   Just felt disappointed in my dinner. Even the lemonade was not good.        On the other hand the wait staff and managers are all very pleasant attentive and prompt.  Maybe I just chose poorly."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, they need to have more bite on the sourdough bread  the appetizer was amazing, spinach artichoke dip was one of the best, shrimp and chicken jambalaya was wonderful the spice was perfect."}
{"text":"First, let me say, I was very afraid of what we'd find because of two reasons.  1 - It was Thanksgiving and we didn't have a reservation. 2 - We had been to another Mimi's in Scottsdale and it was horrible.  First, we walked up around 2 PM on Thanksgiving Day without reservations, but the manager found room for us to sit with two kids.  The turkey was probably my least favorite part of the meal.  The dark meat was good, but the breast tasted suspiciously like pre-packaged turkey.  Anyway, I had a couple of drinks also, and the bartenders were wonderful.  The staff were of the caliber of a much more expensive place.  All in all, I was very impressed.  We will be returning on a day that is not as hectic."}
{"text":"Great home style food.  One of my favorite breakfast places."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this restaurant so much but it was very disappointing. We ordered the breakfast, omelet for my husband and bacon and eggs for me. The croissant was good but hard to swallow with the bad service from Melissa, our waitress. We ordered orange juice for our daughter, she forgot it, then said she just assumed we only wanted water because most parents just order water or milk for their kids. We must be awful parents. I guess kids don't need vitamin C. The service was slow, it took 20 minutes for drinks and she never brought the bread basket. When we asked the person who brought the food, Melissa brought it to the table and slammed the plates on the table. All served with a fake smile.No worries we will NOT be back. Slow service, bad first impression, and very average breakfast I could have made myself. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Dinner (had 1/2 off coupon) here, and it was very good. Good server, professional staff, clean and fun environment.. I had the seafood skewers, side of sauteed vegetables was just right and fresh, vinaigrette baby greens salad.. my scallops and shrimp skewers we cooked just perfectly.. wife tried the Quiche Lorraine, and it was good.. fresh bread, butter was nice.. we'll go back indeed.. menu diverse, some favorites and comfort foods.. recommended.. Negative: I did alert the server that I believe in menu prices.. their menu left off prices for beers, and also all beverages (coffee, etc.).. just need to give people information so they can make the right choices..."}
{"text":"Mimis cafe has a french decór and a dimmed-lit atmosphere. I felt like it was raining outside (when it wasn't) and I had that  cozy, lets order a cocktail and see where the day goes kind of vibe. I ordered the eggs benedict. Really good! The yolk was runny like I like it, and the ham and potatoes pulled all the delicious flavors together while the biscuit was soft enough to absorb my leftover yolk!!! Nommies! The only thing I didn't love was our server, she was nice, but real quiet with no engagement. It was my first experience here so i'll give it another try! I will be back for the benedict, that wasn't overpriced and maybe for sunday morning cocktails. I'm pretty sure there was a sign that said all day happy hour! That's right up my alley! ;)"}
{"text":"We've been to Mimi's quite a few times by now and I think it's time to spit out a review.  First off, sign up for their emails because they have coupons just about every week.  Of course, coupons also show up in our newspapers too so we can't help but take advantage of their BOGO specials.  One thing we both love are their house made crab cakes.  They serve them up in a few different ways - as an appetizer, benedict, and omelette.  We love them all!  The Crab Cake Florentine Benedict is griddled with spinach, poached eggs, and lemon hollandaise sauce.  They serve this until noon, and it comes with red potatoes, freshly baked muffin and juice.  ($9.99)  This is my go to choice when I'm dining there.  Another version is their Crab Cake Omelette.  It's a three egg omelette with red and green bell peppers and green onions.  The crab cakes sit on top of them, and they have hollandaise sauce, feta cheese, and diced tomatoes on top.  Also served with their potatoes, muffin and juice. ($9.99)  We've also enjoyed their Crab Cake appetizer, which is also griddled and comes with a citrus remoulade and balsamic baby greens.  The Husband also enjoyed their Asparagus and Brie Quiche, which also has bacon and tomatoes in it, and some fruit on the side.  We mostly come around for brunch, so we can't say much about their dinner menu.    Service has been fine for us, we have no issues at all.  One thing we appreciate is that they have a sling for car seat carriers.  Love that!"}
{"text":"I eat at Mimis a lot.  There is nothing to complain about at all.  I usually get the three course meal."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for a few months now and overall, have not been to a restaurant where I was fully satisfied. I almost lost hope for the city until I went to Mimi's Cafe tonight.   To be honest, I don't remember what I ordered. I don't remember the name of any of the dishes I ordered except for the salad and fries. But, the food was delicious.  Along with great food came great service. My waitress was not only courteous and fast paced, she was also very knowledgeable about the food and the restaurant.   So overall, for my first visit to this establishment, I was very impressed and plan on coming back in the future. Great food, great service, great restaurant."}
{"text":"The young man/host that greeted us was awesome but our waitress was extremely scatter brained and messed up all of our orders, didn't refill out waters, and didn't check on us. The food was good but the service really ruined the experience. The bread basket was a nice touch though. I also recommend the french onion soup."}
{"text":"i was so disappointed, I used to love this restaurant in CA but in recent years the menu had changed for the wrose. They used to have a chicken breast with a salad and fruit salad, yummy dish with Tacos. My partner had steak which came with french fries and coleslaw , his dish was yummy. I had a chinese chicken  salad  you need to look for the chichen, however, the portion was huge but where was the chichen???. First time in AZ and last time."}
{"text":"The food is not good at all. $30 for two people and I think fast food tastes better. We have not eaten there for breakfast, but I don't see how they screw up dinner this bad. How do you screw up dressing?"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only gets 3 stars. Had brunch and it was fantastic. Service was great. Only waited 15 min sat morning. Had mimosas and eggs Benedict and it was delish. Will be back to try lunch or dinner in the future. Glad we stopped I always just drive by thinking it was like a Denny's but it's not at all!"}
{"text":"Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back."}
{"text":"A goodbye luncheon took me to Mimi's Cafe - Desert Ridge (21001 North Tatum Boulevard, Phoenix, AZ 85050). The French-inspired chain restaurants offer hearty portions of comfort food at reasonable prices. I had the \"Meatloaf & Mash,\" which consisted of a generous slice of the house-made loaf, creamy mashed potatoes with a tasty gravy and a medley of fresh vegetables. The service was exceptional, and the environment was cozy and comfortable."}
{"text":"Mimis always takes great care of our networking group on Wednesday mornings. Good service!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the coastal shrimp and even though it had a lot of garlic, it was very good. The best part of our meal was our server, Sy. He was polite, professional and very pleasant! He is wasting his talents at Mimi's. he belongs in a 5 star gourmet restaurant on the strip!"}
{"text":"This Mimi's used to be really good years ago when it first opened...now it's ok.   I hate dealing with the crowds of old folks that are here ALL OF THE TIME. The service is hit or miss...sometimes you get a good, attentive Food Server and other times, um not.  If you sign up for their emails, they'll send you a coupon for a FREE BREAKFAST. Maybe that's why it's ALWAYS busy in the morning."}
{"text":"Usually, peak breakfast crowds don't start piling into restaurants until 8:30-9am on a Sunday morning, before you have to put your name on the waiting list. However, being Mother's Day, the parking lot was already full at 7am!!!  We walked in and were seated right away.   I like the sounds of a busy restaurant, mixed with the familiar breakfast aromas of fresh coffee and pancakes in the morning.  The Food Server appeared right away to greet & take our order, brought out the beverages, and the food quickly arrived shortly afterwards.   No complaints, EXCEPT when I asked for a bag (again) the Food Server told me that he \"didn't forget, it just wasn't a PRIORITY...\" Um, nice, real nice comment, buddy.  The food was good as usual.  As we left, we saw mass crowds of hungry patrons in the front and spilling outside.   Mimi's offers complimentary coffee and spice cake samples as you wait. A very nice touch. I guess if you were homeless or just plain cheap, you could fill up on FREE coffee and FREE spice cake without actually dining there."}
{"text":"must say service was great,  restaurant was clean,  food tasted good....  i would only have to say the only down side was the quantity.   i ordered one of the salads with  salmon    the portion of salmon was fair  but the quantity of lettuce was minimal  which left me leaving there hungry.   when; we said some thing to our server and she told us they measure it out.  wish she would have done more.          i felt like saying but didn't   this salad was $14 they could have put on another few pennies of lettuce.     it goes to show you that chain restaurant use trained monkeys, and they should be taught to use there eyes also.     this visit reminded me why i don't go to chain restaurants"}
{"text":"Our recent visit here was very pleasant, and relaxing.  the whole staff was very attentive and they all help make sure  our table and the other around us where being taken care of by all staff,  which maded the experience very pleasant.   This was the first time coming to MIMI's in many years and it seemed to better then I remembered."}
{"text":"Good basic breakfast place. A range of options and sides. Tried the breakfast tacos which had very good guacamole and the salmon benedict. They also carry massive fresh muffins!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time here (5/10), and it was definitely a great experience! As soon as we got in, we were seated. Our server was Sarah and she was super friendly. She was very attentive even though she was helping about 6 other tables. We got the stuffed French toast and the mixed berry French toast. They were great, super good! Amazing portion sizes, they filled us up super quick. The atmosphere is friendly and comfortable as well. We are definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"It was my sister-in-law Judy's birthday and Mimi's is where she picked. I've been to Mimi's once before and had a good experience, but this time not so good. Our group had arrived before we got there and had ordered drinks, just water, but when we came our waiter never asked us if we wanted something to drink. When our waiter finally came over  I quickly made my order which was a warm turkey sandwich with Brie cheese, green apple, with apricot preserves on a croissant. Sounded right up my alley cause I've been on a huge Brie kick! The waiter asked if fries were OK and I said yes, assuming that's what came with it. Found out later I could have had a salad instead. I was very disappointed in my sandwich, but I was happy the apricot preserves came on the side cause they were gross. The croissant was crumbling and dry. I doubt there was any Brie on the sandwich at all. Overall I ended up ditching the croissant and just eating the meat and apples. The fries were also meh.   Everyone else in my group enjoyed their food. My Husband and brother-in-law got the Le Burger de Madame. It wasn't cooked medium like my husband requested, but well done. He also mentioned that the fried egg was popped and leaking a bit. My mother and sister-in-law both got the Quiche Lorraine which they had salads with. The Quiche has bacon and Swiss cheese running threw it. Looked very tasty. My other sister-in-law had the Fall Harvest Salad which had honey walnuts, cranberries and a bed of greens with a Honey Dijon Vinaigrette. She said it was very good and she even finished the whole salad.  Maybe it was just an off day, but I've had better. For the price and discription I expected a really good sandwich, but I was sadly let down. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good. we love the French cafe style of Mimi's always good fresh food. We've always had pretty great service prices reasonable. The Cobb salad and muffin combo is like sex! :-)"}
{"text":"very bad experience here from food to service to them somehow losing my credit card"}
{"text":"Not the place it used to be.   Portions seem to be smaller than in the past,  but the prices are up. We were here on a Wednesday night and it was slow.  So was the service. I believe Miami ' s went \"corporate\" several years ago,  and it is my guess that the bean counters have an undue influence on the operation.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I love this Mimi's Cafe! The one by me closed down (215 & Rainbow). The funny thing is, we always get the same waiter  when we go, which is fine because he's so nice and he gets us everything we need one time.  Highly recommend the Bacon Avocado Sourdough Burger! I am so picky when it comes to burgers cuz to me, they all taste kinda the same but this one hits the spot. I LOVE the sourdough bread cuz it has cheese on it too and the flavor blend of that and the rest of the burger just goes so well on the palette.   Service is always fast even on a busy night when its packed.  I have no complaints about this place, I love coming here when I crave a tasty burger. If you're in the area, come thru!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and ordered a Quiche Florentine.  It was very good.   I also got the 3 different juices with the small bottle of champagne.  That was really quite fun and refreshing."}
{"text":"More French than ever, new menu, and freshly prepared food.  I'm new to Mimi's Cafe.  I didn't know what it was, nor that it was a chain.  Because it is a chain restaurant, I expected prepared foods vs fresh and nouveau versions of French dishes.  I'm told it was based more on Louisiana type french but ownership has changed and they just came out with a brand new menu as of 2 days ago.  I'm told some of the regular customers are upset that certain dishes are gone.  This happens and is necessary because a business cannot survive on just old time regulars, they need to pull in new customers as time goes on.  But this change is for the better from what I can deduce, at least for me.   The food is no longer prepared, it is all freshly made in house.  A change from the past.  Also the dishes are much more traditional French now.  In fact, many of the dishes are recipe's from the original founder.  It really is a French restaurant now.  The dishes will continue to change over time, which is the mark of a fine restaurant.   I had lunch but the food was so good I had to come back for dinner.  My servers were superb.  They were also under criticism from some of the regulars about the menu changes.  It's not their fault and again, I think it's for the better if you like more traditional French cuisine and you like it made fresh in house.   It's going to take me many more trips before I get to try everything but I will as I like just about everything I see on the menu.  We don't even have a real French restaurant where I am from but this one is very close to me here.  I expect to become a regular myself.   Again, not being used to this area I am not fully aware of relative pricing.  The dishes at Mimi's, being more traditional French without odd flares, were less expensive than I would have thought for fresh cooking, however.  The portions of the dishes I had were  good for the price.  IMHO, I thought they were quite reasonable and not expensive.   Inexpensive, freshly prepared, traditional French.  I'm very pleased.  People need to come in and try the new menu.  Forgive them for dropping older favorites and try the new dishes.  Some of them are fantastic."}
{"text":"When I first moved into the house that I reside in, one of the requirements I had for my roommate was that we needed to take advantage of a bonding opportunities. Roomie meals, if you will. That's why, I was super ecstatic when the opportunity came up to have brunch with my roommate! She told me about Mimi's and how good their breakfast menu was. I knew the stars align and that we needed to check this place out!  I love how identifiable this place is! When you pull up, you notice the cottage looking restaurant. I don't know about you but when I see a cottage, I think cozy and warm. Once you walk in, the cottage theme continues very nicely. Wooden beams and ceilings, brick fire place, exposed brick walls, diner booths, this place has it all! The walls are decorated with eclectic artwork and Parisian prints and vino. Our server was not as personable as I would have preferred for brunch, but still very efficient. Our food didn't take long and he constantly checked up on us throughout the meal. Speaking of, here's what I got:  Large, fresh squeeze orange juice for $2.99. It was served in a beer flute like glass. The juice was definitely fresh! Lots of pulp and had a more tangier taste which I really liked!  Petite stack, Mimi's Original Buttermilk Pancakes for $5.99. The pancakes were dense with a little bit of crispy edges. If you're looking for that pancake fix, this will definitely do it. The syrup and butter are essential for the entire experience of course. Although I have my favorites when it comes to pancakes, this was definitely a delicious cake.  Bayonne-Style Corned Beef Hash Benedict for $9.99. Homemade corned beef hash patties topped with poached eggs and traditional hollandaise. The corned beef patties were good. Mixed with onions, it brought a nice crunchy element to the patty. The poached eggs were cooked nicely. The broken yolks only added a flavorful element to the overall dish.  What I was not a fan of was the hollandaise sauce. There was no flavor in my opinion, just a little bland.   Yes, when I think of cottages, I think of warm and cozy. This place really stacked up nicely for me. The decor and comfort food measured up to this warm and cozy experience. I'll definitely be back for more on another roomie adventure meal!"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast.  Are at Mimi's two times in the week we were in Glendale. The homemade Corned Beef Have was amazing. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came in because it was close to home and they were running a deal with $10 off $30. Even though it's close to home we havent gone in maybe a year. Last time we had a positive experience....boy, what a difference a year makes.   Hostess that sat us I think was crying. Her eyes were red and wet. Maybe it's allergies, but if it's not...Jesus, somebody give her a 10 minute break to cool down. Just heartless if the girl got some bad news or having a bad day and they just put her in the front to be the supposed to be smiling first face you see.   We sat in a corner booth and the table was dirty and the drape decor in our booth was dusty. There was this sewer smell that we couldn't quite place that was on that side of the restaurant and was on and off. We moved booths and it wasn't as bad, but you get a whiff sometimes...should've left....shoudl've fucking left then.   Bf got their Summer 3 course meal which you pick a soup or salad, a entree and a petite dessert. French Onion Soup- okay, nothing special. Chicken& Asparagus Ravioli- the chicken pieces were shredded breast and was overcooked. The sauce had a flavor about it...it was overly seasoned with oregano that you couldn't taste anything else. (We started to get our food and thats when the smell came back too- should use the other side of the restaurant if the smell is on this side of the place).  Dessert- Cinammon Beignets w/ custard inside served with chocolate and raspberry sauce- too doughy, but was okay.   I got beef bourguignon. It was good, but this was no borguignon. It's pot roast with gravy and vegetables thrown on it. They gave me grilled asparagus on it which is a plus with me since I love em grilled. Mashed potato served with it wasn't seasoned.  I got a petite treat of the bread pudding. This wasn't petite, it was actually a pretty big serving. It wasn't good. Dense dry, and then the syrup which is normally yummy butterscotchy syrup was just syrup. It didn't taste like anything, it was just sweet. C'mon even Station casinos one comes with a vanilla custard and good syrup on it.   Highlight of the meal for me was the free breadbasket. I like their carrot cake loaf.   The service was attentive I'll give them that. Our drinks were refilled, we were checked on. Now if the kitchen crew and cleaning crew can get with it. Food was not good and the place isn't deep cleaned so they're slacking off.   The BF was not feeling it and left a bit annoyed and not  wanting to come back.   Now the kicker- I just got home and threw up, twice already.   Yeah, we're not coming back nor letting any of our friends eat here. I have a nose and throat infection developing so I feel like shit already and no, this kind of getting sick doesn't make me throw up. Thanks for making my day the worse it can possibly be."}
{"text":"Great place for ladies to lunch, good selection and medium price.  Good server that had way too many tables."}
{"text":"Food great as always at any mimi's....service started out good then forgot about us...too long of a wait to leave disappointing start of the day for a very long road trip"}
{"text":"The food is good, but great service if you sit with Steve. He only works mornings though. Sit with Steve!"}
{"text":"Mimi's cafe is okay for me. its okay that it never made me crave for anything so i never came back... the service was good but the sandwiches we ordered was pretty dry. I can personally make a better tuna sandwich! the cappuccino i ordered was good though. Props to the cute decorations in the cafe though :)"}
{"text":"We were visitors (table of 5) in town and looking to get some dinner. Having read some of the previous reviews, we were concerned with the service. We were very happy with our server- she was personable and checked in often to refill drinks and clear plates. We ordered a Cobb salad, chicken pot pie, fish and chips and shrimp pasta. (I forgot what the other person  ordered.) Portions were large and some came with muffins. I learned that the muffins are famous and rightfully so. Best of all, we completed the survey that came with the bill and returned the next day to get 2 free muffins. (We ended up saving the muffins for our early morning flight the next day.- best idea ever!) These were the best muffins I have ever had and they were the size of soft balls! We had a very good experience and would return the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"If you sign up for their email club you get a free crepe cake. We had the French onion soup, bread basket, and chicken crepes all very good. This is our first time at the dinner hour and we still be back"}
{"text":"I usually love going to Mimi's, but had never been to this location before. I will never go there again. We had a party of 15 with a reservation so they knew we were coming. We waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got 4. We dealt with that and passed them around. That was the least of the issues. About 45 minutes after sitting down, our orders were taken. The bread baskets finally came. I waited about 20 minutes for a refill on my coffee and then went and got it myself. I also got extra napkins, which we had asked for, and refilled some water glasses for my group. Some of us ordered from the \"Cafe Express\" menu, because we thought that would be easy and quick. Not so! It took at least 45 minutes from the time we ordered until ALL of our party had their food. That is inexcusable! When the food came, some of it was wrong, but we didn't dare send it back for fear that we'd never get the right food returned. Some of us would have ordered dessert, but figured it would take too long to get it, since our waiter, Tony, kept on complaining about the number of tables he had to cover and how overworked he was.   On the \"Cafe Express\" menu, it states that if you don't get your food in 15 minutes, it will be free. Since they had WAY exceeded the time limit they themselves had set, I pointed that out. If it had only been 20 minutes, we would have let it go, but this was well past that. I was told that the 15 minute time limit  did not apply to large groups, though that is not stated anywhere. After some discussion, we were told the manager would adjust the bills, but it was because we insisted that they honor the commitment they made, not because they wanted to. I am not sure if the problem is in the kitchen or out on the floor, but it needs to be fixed.  I will still go to Mimi's, just not that location."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant - usually sit outside even though the view is of the parking lot - LOL.   The staff are so sweet and fun they make you feel like you're on vacation somewhere.   The food is always excellent (to my standards) and their wine specials usually suck me in.   They play French music and some light jazz, so you can actually carry on a conversation. So.... I keep going back to Mimi's. (Smiles)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My minister lives in Henderson and I live at the other end of Vegas so we have met here for lunch a couple of times. Never a disappointment--food is excellent, it's quiet enough to talk, and the music is good too.  Thanks again, Mimi's!"}
{"text":"A couple of the Mimi's reviews were less than complimentary for this location.  So my roommate and I did a location comparison and find this location to be just as wonderful as ever.  Of course, if you like a quieter restaurant, you'll want to ask for the carpeted room, but that's always true. So....Yay, Mimi's you rang our bell yet again."}
{"text":"We like Mimis Cafe although we do not make it a habit of eating here. We recieved some BOGO coupons in the mail and decided to come here for breakfast. The small print on the coupon said to recieve the offer, you have to buy 2 beverages. We had 2 coffees at $2.65 each which if i am not mistaking is more than Starbucks.   When you order either waffles, pancakes or french toast, you also get 2 eggs any style and your choice of sausage, turkey sausage or bacon. My wife ordered fruit pancakes and i ordered bananas foster pancakes. The food was what we expected with the exception of the bacon.  It was the worst. It reminded my of microwave bacon or the cheap stuff they serve for breakfast at a Best Western. Terrible disappointment on the fake bacon but everything else was great.   Willy was our server and he was on it and had a great attitude. Another person went around to refill empty coffee mugs.   We got a great deal at $20.00 so thanks Mimis for the coupon. The place was pretty sparse the whole time we dined. Be sure to order a muffin here. Baked here fresh everyday and oh so yummy! 6 pack abs will have to wait another day."}
{"text":"This place is simple and good.  They email you coupons every couple of days.  Their breads are great.  I recently ordered their french onion soup and it was very good and not too salty.    I ordered their 3 course bistro meal and although it was filling, and the entree I chose was good, I would not order the meal again.  The downside to their 3 course meal for me was simple, the dessert was a 1 scoop ice cream sundae and to upgrade for $4 you get a raspberry cheesecake NO OTHER OPTIONS.  Every restaurant that is running this type of deal is throwing in a  either an appetizer choice or a dessert CHOICE not just ice cream.  So I was very disappointed on this option.  But the entree was good, service was very very nice as well.    My dad had ordered cole slaw with his sandwich and the cole slaw had no flavor and  was very very basic and will not be ordered again.   I will definitely go back to mimi's again, they have several good menu items."}
{"text":"On Thu/11 Dec about 11 am had the $18.99 NY Steak & Eggs; the menu says the steak was aged for 29(?) days: 1) For dine in.  Had it rare, meat was tough.  Ran out of ketchup twice (should have told the waiter to bring me a bottle instead of just a dinky little sauce cup of it), which was annoying.  Didn't care for the home fries even though waiter says they make it themselves fresh on premises (I prefer In 'N' Out's fresh fries version). 2) Had ordered 1 to go (had to use up the $25 gift card I got from work), waiter recommended that the steak be medium-rare for safety reasons since I was taking it home.  Oddly, the medium-rare steak microwaved in my kitchen and eaten off my coffee table was much better than the rare steak I had at the restaurant.  Also, for the to-go order I opted for fried potatoes instead of fries, and the potatoes (little spuds cut up) were great, especially with my endless supply of ketchup from my fridge.  I won't be back here ever...unless I get another gift card from work or somewhere.  Even then I might elect to sell the gift card on plasticjungle.com for 1/2 off."}
{"text":"Stopped by Mimi's for lunch yesterday with my girlfriend and had a nice meal. The service was ok, our waitress could have been friendlier. But the food was satisfying and very flavorful. First off, the carrot cake bread that they serve when you sit down alongside the rolls are fantastic! I could just eat that and be happy for days. We both had the french onion soup and it came out hot and full of flavor, was made very well. She ordered the grilled cheese with fries and seemed happy with her meal. I had the 9.99 lunch special which consisted of your choice of either a starter or a dessert plus a \"Just Enough\" entree with a drink. The selections are limited of course but it was still a good deal for 9.99. My french onion soup was my starter i chose and I had meatloaf straganoff (?) as my entree. The meal was good and as stated in the menu was \"just enough\".  Will be going back again to give another try and if its just as good as yesterday will keep the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Lunch specials! Half sandwich and soup. Perfect size portions and fantastic prices. Plus.... carrot cake loaf here is A-MAZING. Ask for bread at the table and get a few pieces and then buy one to go (2.99) you won't regret it.  Had the tuna sandwich with french onion soup.... awesome lunch and didn't break the bank. Great service, really can't complain! This location is a bit hidden in the back of this complex but it is comfortable and absolutely worth a lunch visit."}
{"text":"The food is great every time I visit. Service is a 50/50... really good or meh. Leroy was our server today and He rocked! We all have our \"off-days,\" and today was mine. He went above and beyond to make me & my friend smile to ensure our time at Mimi's was exceptional. And like always breakfast is the best. Thanks for a great early morning start! (Ps, they open at 7am)"}
{"text":"I have been to Mimi's twice now. Once for lunch a and once for breakfast! They have the best pumpkin muffin! The first time I had an amazing salad that was large enough for 3! The second time I did a breakfast omelette and lots of coffee!"}
{"text":"Food was cold as well as the server which is more colder and that server I think is a prejudice her name is Melissa. We. Been ask for 2x only n that's to take orders and last was to serve the food  but never ask or refill our beverage. I don't think she deserve a tip but my husband says give a little even though it's not deserving..will never go back"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this restaurant as of 9/27/16.   I've loved Mimi's since discovering it many years ago; however, last evening the Quiche was not completely done, the salad was very wilted, and their rendition of a SW Reuben was horrible.   Please tell me Mimi's is not going to go down the drain quality-wise like so many have done. Mary W."}
{"text":"Perhaps my opinion has been swayed of this place slightly, since the friend I took with me kept yelling out \"WHERE THE FUCK IS MY BREAD!?!?\" and alas, no appetizer bread was ever brought to our table. Weird to be lacking on, when it's suppose to be a routine thing?   Regardless of the MIA bread, the meal came out pretty quick, which was expected because we were there when it was practically empty.   The tomato soup was pretty good, but can't say that I was impressed with the \"steak\" I was served. Not cooked the way I asked, for one, and I'm also sure it wasn't even real meat. Tasted more like soybeans and earthworms.   The mash potatoes were also lacking in any sort of flavor other than sand. Maybe a little hint of salt, but that could of been the leftover oily residue that was on my tongue from the fake-a-steak.  Our waiter seemed less than enthused to be around people, but regardless he was attentive and refilled our drinks frequently. He was probably in a hurry to get us the hell out of their before we started complaining to him.  All in all, there are a lot of other eateries in this area, and I probably won't opt for this one again."}
{"text":"Great service on New Years Eve. Ordered chicken Parmesan and bacon cheeseburger. Fries are fresh, drinks refilled without being asked. Will be back."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving Dinner - Mimi's Special 3-course meal. All except the salad and corn soup SUCKED! This was a terrible meal.   The veggies -- carrots and broccoli -- were inedible. They were microwave bagged crap. My 1st serving was almost raw, the replacement was hot, hard and dry. Cardboard would taste better!  NOTHING -- except the salad and corn soup -- was fresh or prepared on premises.  Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and gravy -- A homeless shelter would server better food to its people.  SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!"}
{"text":"I have brought my family here many times and have never been disappointed. Comfort food just like grandma makes, spiced to perfection.  We have never had an issue with service. Even their take out crew is awesome!"}
{"text":"We're not fans of chain restaurants, but this Mimi's Cafe is better than most.  Food is consistent, always good flavor, but nothing fancy. Mimi's Iced Tea is consistently weak ... wish they could fix that.  Our server (Shambray)  was fast, attentive, and made every step count.  Handled a rush of 5 tables at once, including a party of 6-7, with grace.  Seemed like all the tables were taken care of efficiently and left happy.  A good experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Been almost 2 years since last here.   Excellent service.   Waitress and other staff very attentive to whatever you needed or asked about.    Food was excellent.   Bread basket was offered and accepted.   Thanks for improving"}
{"text":"Not sure why such low ratings. Food was great. Service was great. Went for breakfast and had the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"My wife likes this place alot.  It's OK.  The food was good.  To my surprize, they have a bar in the middle of this place.  The servings were a little small, but that's fine.  Little pricy."}
{"text":"This location has definitely gone downhill. I want to like Mimi's, I really do. Brunch was a simple order of Brioche French Toast. I asked if they could add berries since I saw them on advertised pancakes. The server, Candace, said \"Sure!\" When I received the bill, I was charged $2.59 for a side of fruit. While I realize that is not a large sum (which is not the point), I have 2 issues. #1 Any time there is an upcharge, the customer should ALWAYS be informed of it at the time of the order. #2 there were about 8 blueberries and 1 thinly sliced strawberry on the french toast---not even close to the amount to qualify for a \"side\".   They weren't horribly busy but it was steady. The server bumped into our table, nearly spilling the drinks several times as she dashed about like a chicken with her head cut off. Parts of the order were not prepared properly and an assistant asked if we wanted freshly ground pepper on our bacon. (???)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice, for lunch. The first time I had the 1/2 French dip and my Mom had the fish and chips. The French dip was really good, tender beef and not at all salty on the dip. My Mom's fish and chips were really good too. 4 pieces of fish, light crisp batter and the hand cut fries! Yum! The next time we I had the pot roast, very good, mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. The spinach was cooked to the right temperature, not too wilted. A couple of setbacks but all were addressed promptly and corrected. Terrible coleslaw, cold fries and cold au jus. Mimi's deserves more than 3 stars. Get the coupon on Facebook. But one entree get one free. A good deal considering it's a bit pricey for lunch"}
{"text":"So I guess Mimi's exists to do to French cuisine what Olive Garden does to Italian...insult the sh$% out of it.  I've had better frozen microwavable meals out of Trader Joe's.  The only redeeming quality came out of the fresh table rolls.  Forget this place."}
{"text":"The turkey and mashed potatoes were ok but the steak in the steak frites was inedible. Our waitress was so nice though. We will not be back"}
{"text":"I came in here last week with my friend and definitely had a great experience. I ordered the shrimp pasta. It was delicious! They were very generous with the shrimp portion and the sauce was light with a distinct garlic and lemon taste. I love garlic and lemon! The roasted broccoli was a very nice touch! I also had the spinach dip appetizer. This was the first time ever that I had more dip than chips, which usually doesn't happen so thank you for the generous portion! Ivette was our server and she was so attentive! She was very helpful with explaining menu items and always had a smile on her face. If you come, ask if she is working and sit in her section! She definitely iffers amazing service and is very attentive. :)"}
{"text":"Food is decent but definitely \"chain\" quality. The servers suck. Overpriced."}
{"text":"Hit and miss, but good pancakes and FO soup  My experience goes between good and bad at this Mimi's.  Food is usually good for a chain place, but the service makes or breaks it each time.    On a good day, we get someone attentive, who brings out food and drinks promptly, is friendly, and gets us out the door in about an hour to hour and 15 minutes.  On a bad day, we wait 10-15 minutes to order, 5-10 minutes for drinks, 20-30 minutes for our food, have to ask for any refills, get a mix of hot and lukewarm plates, wait 10-15 minutes for dessert, and then wait another 10-25 minutes to finish paying.  We've learned that if our server is slow, we need to skip dessert and have something elsewhere.  Average loudness and pricing.  If not for the Minnie Mouse pancakes and french onion soup, I might avoid the place for being bipolar on the service side."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that Mimi's Cafe seems to have recovered from the disastrous menu change of a few years ago, and it is back to being the Mimi's Cafe that I enjoyed so much previously.  If only they would bring back red bean and sausage soup . . ."}
{"text":"Where to start? My eggs Benedict were great. Now, for the problems. Dirty dishes. Had to ask several times for water or coffee refills. Waitress had us passing stuff to others instead of walking around the table. O.j. Tasted like it had grapefruit juice mixed in or was watered down. Fresh fruit was unripe and/or mushy. Bacon was thin, precooked and tasteless. French toast advertised as brioche but it was regular bread. Annoying burnt toast smell the whole time. Avoid."}
{"text":"My wife and I have taken advantage of their coupon special several times.  Food is well above average.  In other words, great value.  Staff is courteous.  Love the ambiance, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service is awful, floors are dirty with food still on floor. The omelets cheese is cooked too long, potatoes too overcooked. Tired of screaming babies, have to leave"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food is french inspired without being pretentious.  During a vacation, I visited on both my first and last day.  1st day was the crab cake bendict and the 2nd time was the broche french toast. Both delicious.  You get a lot without paying a lot.  They also offer a bar and to go services.  I really wish they had this chain out east."}
{"text":"Mimi's Cafe resides in an ideal location at the corner of Sunset and Stephanie, essentially in the Sunset Station parking lot. I've been to this location about 10 times, and took a friend who had never been before.   I tend to think of Mimi's as a breakfast/lunch eatery, although they do serve dinner. When I asked my friend's opinion, he said his food was \"fantastic\" and said he would definitely come back. I also found my food to be prepared as expected, and the wait to receive it was acceptable.  I have always found the food here to be excellent, and the service to be satisfactory. It's definitely a notch above IHOP or Denny's.  For this particular visit, we both had special-order omelets, and he added avocado on the side. With drinks, the total bill for two was $34 + tip."}
{"text":"We love going to Mimi's for our early dinners. Food is always good and staff very attentive. The section of food is varied and tasty."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and was pleasantly surprised with the fish&chips. We also had the French onion soup which is always awesome.  The food is always pretty close to home cooking as your gonna get.  Jessica our server was great , not much of a happy birthday singer BUT great service thanks Jessica and Mimi's for a great experience"}
{"text":"Had great dinner here. Service was great. We had the mussels as an appetizer (huge serving). Hubby had steak and eggs(good) while I ordered the French pot roast (ok). We shared the creme brûlée cheesecake for dinner - good stuff!"}
{"text":"Brie with apricot chutney was the only thing that I love in this place. The rest... meh! However, my server was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Eat here regularly but today was the worst. Got there at noon. It wasn't busy which should have told me something. There was no hostess to greet us. Waited 5 minutes for the hostess. Finall seated. Waited 10 minutes for someone to take drink order. When the sever Sarah took our orders, she,started walking away before we were finished ordering. Finally got our food. We were warned that the plates were hot. Thats all that was hot. My sandwich was warm at best and the fries were cold, soggy and old. Couldn't get drink refills. Never saw the server until she came by to see if we wanted desert. As soon as we said no, she dropped the check on the table and walked away. Fortunately I had cash. Don't waste your time or money here. Prices were recently raised and food quality has gone way down."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch at this Mimi's.  They sat us in a back booth in an empty section of the restaurant.  What they didn't tell us is that they planned to seat about 20-25 women in a long table less than three feet from us.  The women even apologized as they knew they were so loud.  We left earlier than planned because my friend and I couldn't talk as we could not even hear each other.  No apology from the server or even an offer to re-seat us (be aware that, even at this point, we were still the only people in that room besides the party of women and there were plenty of other tables available in the other sections of the restaurant).  I approached the manager before we left to politely tell him that, perhaps in the future, they should be aware of this when seating small parties of diners next to large groups.  His reaction was apathy bordering on contempt and his response was (I kid you not), 'that's the way they do it and there was nothing that was going to change in the future'.  I used to come here often but this is my last visit."}
{"text":"Place was clean, and we'll maintained. We were approached and seated quickly.   Our server was nice. She kept drinks topped off and even brought our food to the table pretty quickly. Only drawback was the adult plates and silverware. We needed to swap out dirty silverware upon arrival to table. Our red potatoes were old and dry. My toast was burnt. My husband's English muffin was also burnt. And my salt came with a side of bacon it was so salty. The food was subpar at best.   A little baffled because last time I was here the food was awesome. And for a Monday when many are at work I would have expected exceptional food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The only good part of the visit was the greeting. I cannot believe that there was actually a wait at the location and they were turning people away by saying there was a 25-30 minute wait.   This is an unorganized mess of a restaurant that obviously need lava common sense manager focused on cleanliness. For starters more than half the restaurant was not being utilized and every one was being crowded into a little area. They had 4+ servers and every employee was in panic/rush mode. The pace and atmosphere was rush and unwelcomed.  They need to slow down, clean the restaurant and tables properly. Nothing was clean. We had to request a bus boy to come re-clean our booth because it had pancake syrup smeared all over - probably a small child seated there before us. They were put out by this request that should never have to be made by a guest in the first place.  The bathrooms were filthy and smelled like a dive bar. There was no point in belaboring the lack of cleanliness in this establishment. There is also no excuse for the poor quality of environment and attention to details.  This place should shut down until they can find an organized management staff.   The food quality was ok at best. The home style corned beef hash promoted by the server was clearly from a can and very cheap version that shouldn't be served in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and food. My waiter was very kind and accommodating.  I enjoyed my dining experience here."}
{"text":"I love this establishment. Great service and food. Nice ambience. Nice meal selections. My waitress Myra was very nice and accommodating. And she let me dine in peace which is a plus for me because often times when I dine at other establishments, the waitstaff checks on my table too frequently, Thus not giving me time to enjoy my meal and experience. Myra was very gracious and gave me space and time to dine and enjoy my meal. For my entrée, I had the quiche Florentine with House salad, Walnut spice muffin and strawberry lemonade. Everything was delicious and wonderfully presented."}
{"text":"This was the worst visit ever! I ordered the avocado crossiant and it was put together poorly! It was piled high with lettuce, 2 small slices of avocado and 1 slice of tomato... the cucumbers, banana peppers and olives were on the plate instead of the sandwich! I cut and attempt to each and it falls apart!  There was no aoili or spread... just dry! Disappointed! It was served with a small garden salad that came to the table after I sent the sandwich back. Needless to say, the salad was the only thing I ate. When we askedfor more bread, the waiter brought it over on paper in his hand! WTHAY! SMH!   As for the little people, they enjoy their meal... one had pancakes and the other had 1/2 turkey club and a cup of corn chowder.  I paid the bill and left a minimal tip! I won't be back!  SN - I could see the kitchen and the staff was playing a bit too much to be cautious of the poor service!"}
{"text":"I am VERY surprised at the previous reviews regarding poor customer service. I visited here today with a women's group from church that included about 20 ladies. The service was the best part of my visit. My waitress, Cheryl, and her crew were very attentive. The glasses were at least half full. All problems were addressed immediately and with a smile.   I ordered the salmon omelette, expecting the salmon and all ingredients to be cooked into the eggs. However, it arrived more like an egg omelette that was cook and they put slices of salmon into after it was cooked. Then there were uncooked pieces of purple onion on top. Rather than even attempt to eat this, I sent it back because I knew it wasn't something I would like. Cheryl was SO nice about it. She even gave me a side salad so I'd have something to munch on while I was waiting (at no charge). I then ordered the pot pie because the picture looked good. Because they were making it from scratch, it took awhile and I asked Cheryl if they could box it up as a to go order, which she happily obliged. The presentation wasn't great, but it tasted fantastic. They could stand to put potatoes in the pot pie, but aside from that it was fine.  Mimi's serves a variety of muffins and they were all delicious. I had the blackberry muffin, which came out steaming hot. You MUST get a muffin. They are melt in your mouth portions of sweet goodness.  Bonus - Despite a group of 20 or so, they did not automatically add gratuity. Hate when restaurants do this. It worked out in the waitress' favor ;-) Good ones don't have to add gratuity."}
{"text":"This was my first, and last visit to Mimi's.  I had to make This a multi-part review to make sure I hit all the bases. Considering the meal was over two hours long I had plenty of time to type while I waited. If I could give them zero stars I would.   SERVICE: The service here is quite horrible.  Aside from Gerry the bartender who is working his butt off the other staff seemed quite lazy, especially the hostesses.  They are also not friendly or pleasant. There were two hostesses, and neither was doing anything. When we arrived I had to wait several minutes for someone to arrive at the podiums.  Then I checked in a party of 2 on a Sunday at 1240 we were told a 40 minute wait.  There were no less than 8 open tables at that time. Many were not cleared of dishes and sat that way through our entire wait.  The hostesses just stand around and chat with each other. Not helping out with clearing tables or keeping track of the empty tables.   We inquired if it was customary to leave open tables unseated with such a long wait list. The hostess initially got attitude and asked if we meant the one table by the hostess stand. When we pointed out the abundance of other tables sitting unused she gave some BS reason about not overwhelming the waitstaff.  Then proceeded to seat parties in the tables that we had pointed out were empty.  So much for not overwhelming the waitstaff.  Meanwhile a table opened up in the bar so we took it.  From here there's an even better birds eye view of all the open tables.  Even through all of this, the bartender is steadily getting hammered and doing his best, and the two hostesses are not lifting a finger to help him out at all. One waitress has come by to help him out occasionally, and if he sees someone idle he will delegate tasks, but this poor man is working his butt off and those hostesses aren't doing a thing. Not even their own jobs. They are also incapable of changing the tv channel in the bar.  Instead they asked the overworked bartender.  Apparently using a remote is also too advanced for them.   HYGEINE: Tables were left cluttered with dirty dishes for very long periods of time. Like 20-30 minutes at a time. The rag used to wipe the tables down looked really gross and not cleaned. More importantly, people in the kitchen were handling food without gloves.  Touching utensils, tickets that servers wrote on, then food. With the same bare hand.  Disgusting. Waiters transferred muffins and other food items with bare hands.   FOOD: We ordered before 1:30. Watched people stand around in the kitchen and not move any food. Someone's order of chicken and waffles literally sat in the window for 15 minutes before it went out. I watched and counted. Food finally arrived at 208. The food was cold, as we figured it would be given the high level of dysfunction.  It was mediocre. Not great. Banana nut bread pancakes are a hoax.  The difference in flavor was imperceptible.  Corned beef hash was greasy and flavorless.  Everything was under salted. Scrambled eggs were cold and runny.   MANAGEMENT:  Clearly, It seemed as though there wasn't any. Turns out there were at least two.  We saw someone else complaining to one, but we ended up speaking with another after our conversation he said he would comp our meal, still somehow we ended up with a bill for $13. Apparently complimentary doesn't mean the same thing all the time?    Finally left over two hours later, needless to say we will not be returning, and I will be posting this on every social media platform possible.  This is probably one of the worst meal experiences I have ever had.  Perhaps Yelp can add a zero star designation for places like this."}
{"text":"So, I've been to a few mimi's cafe locations. This is by far the most chaotic. Now, just simple stuff. I order coffee twice...everyone else in my table of 7 got their drinks and i had to flag down the manager and ask for my coffee a 3rd time. But what got me was when my food came, they served it on a dirty plate. I know it was dirty because i ordered the chicken and waffles, and the stains were blueberry...disappointing. i sent it back and had them serve it on a clean plate. My favorite hone bran muffin was dry....truly not an experience i expected from an established brand. Or is this the trend now for Mimi's Cafe?"}
{"text":"Food was good, a little on the high side for breakfast, but fine for a weekend meal. Chicken and waffles was a unique take, other standard breakfast fare was good.   However, we were shocked at the up-charges on our check - all which were things our server made sound like they were part of the meal. \"Is real maple syrup okay?\" actually meant \"would you like to upgrade to real maple syrup\" for $2.50; \"Are you alright with the roasted potatoes loaded? Onions, peppers, and other stuff\" meant an add-on as well. Very disingenuous phrasing from our server.    This all added about ten bucks onto the bill, which brought a fairly average breakfast for three to $50. Just not worth it, especially with the pretty slow and awkward server who took way too much time laughing with the table next to us. North Scottdale has way better food at this price.   Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 14. They weren't too busy at that time of day, and it was a very enjoyable experience. One server took care of us, and she did a great job. Very attentive and accommodating. The food was really tasty, and we will definitely return. Even the vegetables tasted fresh, not frozen. Very good."}
{"text":"This is my first time being to Mimi's in about 10 years. We went to celebrate my grandma's birthday dinner so there were 6 of us. We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken relatively quickly. And then we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally I had to get someone's attention to come and take our order (and it wasn't even the guy who took our drink order) We waited for a good 30 minutes for our food which is fine, but then it came out cold. It was rather disappointing. It took them about  6 reminders to bring my aunt's muffin she had order but we finally got it when we were paying the check (at least it was warm...). Both my dad and I got stomach aches from the food. Luckily it only lasted until about mid afternoon the next day, but thinking about it still makes me queasy.  The atmosphere is inviting, but the were definitely short staffed last night. Poor waiter was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, so I can be sympathetic to that. However, I won't go there again for dinner. Ever. Maybe breakfast. Breakfast seems to have good reviews."}
{"text":"Good place to have a decent afternoon meal.  I'd like to take a stab at their breakfast the next time I drop by.  Service here rocks!  As for the food, can't really complain about their... ~Complimentary bread (especially the carrot kind) ~Zucchini parmesan ~Grilled garlic sourdough baguette ~Crispy chicken salad  ~Spinach and artichoke dip ~Banana chocolate muffin ~Buttermilk spice muffin ~Clam chowder (maybe I should've ordered the cup, because the bowl was pretty big)  But what's up with that rotten egg smell in some parts of the dining room?"}
{"text":"Today was not their finest moment.  Our server had no sense of urgency at all.  She never asked if I wanted anything to drink other than water, so my Diet Coke fix had to wait.  She took an appetizer order from one person in our party, but waited until the app was delivered before taking our meal order.  When the first three dishes came out, which was half of the table, I began to get excited with the impending arrival of my meatloaf.  After about five minutes she returned with two other plates and then came to me to let me know that they were out of meatloaf.  Um, didn't you know that 20 mins ago when I ordered it?  Oh well.  She then asked if I wanted turkey (um, no), pot roast (not really... Can I just see a menu and then decide please?).   She dropped the menu and disasters l disappeared for another five minutes before coming back to take my order.   I decided on the grilled pork, which was pretty good, but about five minutes after placing the order she returned and this time apologized for the delay since she 'doesn't speak Spanish and had to get someone to translate to the people in the kitchen'!   Huh?!?!?   Not professional at all!!!!     My meal did arrive about five minutes later and was pretty good.    After bringing our checks she disappeared again!  Finally after ten minutes I find another server to ask if we can pay up front.  \"No you'll have to pay your server, I'll get her\". She came over collected the folders and brought them all back except mine.  She said that since I paid cash she'd need to go get change.  I really hope she wasn't thinking I'd say just keep it, although at that point I was so ready to leave.  A few minutes later she returned with my change including an extra dollar.  I can't make this stuff up."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Good service. Can't say I'm a fan of the baked goods though, the muffins I had were a bit dry"}
{"text":"Had a nice Mothers Day Eve breakfast. She ordered the quiche Lorraine and said it was delicious. I ordered the Santa Fe omelet. Loved the spice, but noticed the meat was extra. Coffee is a bit harsh, but still had a very nice breakfast. Price is a little steep, $35 for 2 breakfast without alcohol, but did bring home 4 muffins for tomorrow's breakfast. Still,had a nice experience."}
{"text":"Oh, Mimi's.  I haven't eaten at Mim's cafe in ages!    This Saturday morning, after a mini photo shoot, my fella and I were starving, so we decided to head over to Mimi's.  Formerly a favorite and an every weekend spot, it had  been over a year since the last time we had been there.  There was a bit of a wait, about 15 minutes, but that's pretty standard for MImi's.   We had briefly considered hitting up Cafe Zuppas next door, since we were so hungry, but I'm very glad that we chose to wait.  15 minutes isn't that bad of a wait.  After we were seated, we took a look at the menu, although my fella already knew what he wanted: the chicken chopped salad.  Its his favorite.   For me, while I normally get a chicken Cesar, I'm on a new nutrition plan, and so I wanted to opt for something in diet.    I chose the open faced egg white omelette with tomato, spinach, onion, and goats cheese, served with a cup of fruit.  I also chose the French Onion soup.  The soup was exactly as I remembered it:  one of the best French onion soups I've ever had.  A little salty for me, as I'm really watching my sodium intake, but delicious.    The omelette was perfect.  I asked for it well done (I hate runny eggs), and it was cooked well, and all of the flavors were wonderful.    Service was very friendly, too.    I will definitely be making more of an effort to come back out here on a more frequent basis.  Mimi's has consistently had good food and good service.  I recommend them."}
{"text":"5 min wait to get in. No one at the front,plenty of open tables.Ten min to get a server,got our drinks,another ten min to order lunch 35 min to get our food, a salad and a turkey club. Bread was stale,fries were cold and soggy. My wife's salad was ok,nothing to brag about. An other couple were displeased with their meal also, they left just as we got our meal, we should have left at that point.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone !"}
{"text":"Good  as always , we had the French dip and the French pot roast, both were very good , the server was very attentive and pleasant she refilled our beverages and checked on us to make sure we were happy with our meals."}
{"text":"I've been to this mimis several times as I live close....I've never been impressed by the service.  Tho, today, Erik may have been the only redeeming quality about Mimi's today.  He hustled and was friendly to everybody.  To start, the hostess, Kimberly was snotty. I was eating solo on a Friday just before 11am. She told me to sit and asked my name. I was the only person there at the time!! It took 8 mins to set up a table for me. I would hate to see her/them in action on a busy weekend morning.  I always order the pommes Benedict but with muffins instead of potatoes. It use to be on the menu as florentine but has been replaced. For some reason, the kitchen doesn't want to make my breakfast this way for me, tho they reluctantly did. This dish was really the only reason to come to Mimi's. Guess I don't need to come here again now."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with the family.  I think other reviewers have noticed a staffing problem--starting with the fact they are running this restaurant with minimal staff.  Came in and was told the wait would be 12 minutes.  12?  Weird. Looked around and there were tons of empty tables.   Was wondering why people were waiting when it looked like 1/3 of the restaurant was empty. My husband ordered the French toast brioche and because there has been some confusion in the past, we went so far as to make air circles to confirm with the waiter which French toast we wanted. (It's the round one.) After waiting way too long for our food, the waiter brought the other French toast because he \"was confused.\"  If you're confused about what a customer wanted, would it dawn on you maybe to ask or clarify?  My husband then had to wait to get his meal. Manager did the right thing and comped it, but we'd rather pay for correct food than go through the annoyance. They do have a new chicken and waffle dish which was good, but I won't be eating it much due to the substandard service here."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat at any type of chain but I was with people who really wanted to go here. It was overall underwhelming and would have been a one star had the manager not taken care of the issues. The food was so-so my burger was passable but not cooked the way I ordered. Our appetizers NEVER arrived while people around us who got there later and were being served by the same server got their food. We had to ask multiple times for soda. The last straw was my friend finding MULTIPLE hairs at the bottom of her meal. IT WAS GROSS. We finally asked for the manager and he did right by basically comping the entire check.   Having worked in restaurants and the service for some time I asked him to share some feedback with his waitress. Yes there were screw-ups but they could have been mitigated easily with bread, and at least keeping waters and soda filled. No steps were taken to extend good service except for \"I'm sorry\". In the end the Manager did well but I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"I love this place, however I try to only go when I have a coupon since it's not inexpensive.  The decor, service and food are wonderful.  This is one of my favorite local restaurants."}
{"text":"First, let me start off my saying that this was not my first time at this restaurant.  On Sunday, we had a book club meeting here at Mimi's Cafe, which is a very nice place to hold a book club meeting.  Upon arrival I was greeted by a waiter who pointed me in the direction of my group and was very pleasant.  The wait staff was very prompt, attentive and friendly.  During this visit, I ordered the three meal deal.  Which consisted of a caesar salad, potato corn chowder and the mini cheesecake.  The salad arrived with a light amount of caesar dressing, which was perfect.  They didn't drown the salad in dressing which was nice.  The soup was very creamy, yet thick and hot.  The downside to my meal was the lack of dessert.  They had run out of the mini cheesecake and it was only after I ordered it, did the kitchen staff decide to make more.  Even after sitting there with my group for an additional hour, the cheesecake was never made and I was never able to try it.  Hence the lack of stars.  Overall, this is an okay place to try, but beware they do run out of food quit a bit."}
{"text":"I love Mimis!  It's a reliable, safe bet to go for breakfast!  The food is good, there's plenty to choose from on the menu, PLUS you get juice and a MUFFIN with your meal! It's a win win situation if you ask me! ;)  I like the cute, french atmosphere and the cozy, cabin feeling in these restaurants.  Lunch is pretty good as well, however I prefer Mimi's as a great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Friendly service but server took too long to take our drink order, even longer for our food order. Food took longer to come out than we anticipated. My fiancée ordered orange creme French Toast, her mom ordered smoked salmon Benedict on a croissant, and I ordered an the bacon and Brie omelette with egg whites. I also chose a pineapple upside down muffin since a side of bread came with my meal. Fiancée was happy with the orange creme French Toast but it was way too small. Fiancée's mom was happy with her smoked salmon Benedict. I enjoyed my Brie and bacon omelette (egg whites). Roasted potatoes were tasty. My favorite was the pineapple upside down muffin. Waitress forgot to bring us ketchup and coffee. Probably won't come back knowing that Black Bear Diner is down the street."}
{"text":"took my family there last weekend for breakfast. it was amazing. a little pricey but very good."}
{"text":"Homestyle food, they sold out of the ribs the night I went and the waitress didnt know until she tried to put in my order, so it was a disappointment when she brought the menu back and I picked something quickly, the Turkey dinner tasted like Thanksgiving but wasn't what I wanted"}
{"text":"The meal was a lot smaller than the picture in the menu. The service was slow every time I come here, I don't know why. It wasn't that crowded and I saw enough waiters and waitresses. If you don't use coupon there are 2 more menus to choose from, it's weird. I probably won't come here again, I like Wildflower bread company better."}
{"text":"Made a reservation to meet some old friends at Mimi's for brunch on Sunday. I didn't go in with high hopes since they called us on Saturday saying we missed our reservation... (Told them it was supposed to be for Sunday and they fixed it.) They redeemed themselves after a nice brunch. My boyfriend and I each ordered a mimosa to try... a White Peach Mimosa and a Mixed Berry Mimosa. They were both delightful! For my breakfast I went with the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (CRFT), which came with 4 strips of bacon, 2 eggs (scrambled, well-done), and fruit. The french toast was very sweet (which is to be expected, since it really is a cinnamon roll) and the maple syrup was really unnecessary. I like sweet so I liked the CRFT, but there were two of them and there was no way I was eating more than one (sugar overload), so I took the other one home. I enjoyed the sides also (it was a lot of food) and our server was pretty good. I'll be coming back to Mimi's to try the Lemon Poppy Seed Waffles or the Quiche Lorraine!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for Easter brunch. There was a lot of waiting involved. Our waitress was not the most attentive. The food was very oily. Eggs, bacon, and potatoes... so greasy! My carrot muffin and my friend's croissant were the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Service excellent but atmosphere since the sold is horrible , stucco a gogo instead of the Jazz room. New owners have sucked the life out of here, we're sitting in a glorified Dennys. So long Mimis your only a shell of your previous self"}
{"text":"Sorry, I can't give this anything higher than a 2 rating. I made the mistake of not staying at my lovely hotel for breakfast. Thought this would be faster to get our day started. Wrong-o.  Long wait on a Sunday morning. Perhaps to be expected. But, after waiting so long, had a mediocre experience. This is NOT food I would typically wait for. The server was so stressed and serving far more tables than beyond his capacity that I doubt anyone was getting decent service. From my observation this was true of all the servers in the area.  The noise level was incredibly loud. This made for a non-relaxing Sunday morning brunch-time.  Personally, I do not see the attraction for the crowd that seemed to be willing to wait for such mediocrity."}
{"text":"Great food with the new menu. Love the French onion soup. Even the bread rolls and butter were delicious. I enjoyed the great service and affordable prices! This is the type of restaurant that one can frequently eat at again and again!"}
{"text":"I walked a long ways from my car to get here yesterday with my family.  They had us wait 20 mins for a table even though clearly several were available. The waitress we had was very new.  Very poorly trained.  She took like 10 mins to after 2 of us got a drink to being the children's drinks. And another 15-20 to take our order.  My food as pictured was very little Mac n cheese, I'd say was 25% Mac n cheese and 75% bread crumbs.  Over an inch thick in breadcrumbs.  Trying to give it a chance I dig to the lil bit of Mac there and it's cold and the chicken is room temp.  Hitch really confused me cause the plate was super hot.  I sent it back n they remade it.  This version had just a sprinkle of crumbs as stated in menu and was hot.  During my wait I noticed many cold dishes being complained about at many other tables. So the kitchen wasn't very up to par either. I defiantly won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been to at least a half dozen mimi's.  Usually a mediocre meal, but never awfull.    This mimi's is a gem.  I had a fantastic meal and was blown away.  Yummy!  I don't know if it is the owner or the cook responsible but this particular mimi's is just amazing.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The new French menu has left out some of our favorites and has replaced them with unispired so-called French items. Not a good idea. This is not a French restaurant! Where is the Santa Fe omelette???"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Mimi's Café for maybe 10 years. Frankly I tend to avoid any chain restaurants whenever possible and it was only because out-of-town friends were staying nearby that I got talked into meeting them here.  I wasn't even sure I remembered where in the mall the restaurant is located so I Yelped it first. After seeing the disproportionate number of negative reviews, many of them about bad service, I was ready to call my friends and suggest somewhere else.  But I figured what the heck, it's only lunch, I can grin and bear it.  Not completely surprisingly my experience was not the same as those who posted the negative reviews. Of course I have long ago learned that the way you are treated is a reflection of the way you treat others, and a chain restaurant in a mall frequented primarily by snowbirds is probably going to get more than its share of, shall we say, not very pleasant customers.  We arrived at noon on a Sunday, the worst possible time to arrive for lunch at a chain restaurant in a mall. Sure enough, most of the tables were occupied but the greeter was able to seat us immediately. I'll cut to the chase ... every staffer we came into contact with was friendly, helpful and pleasant.  Of course, then again so were we.  We were served beverages within one minute. Our order was taken within a comfortable 5 minutes. The meal was served within about 10 minutes and the check was presented just when we would have expected it to have been.  Clearly the problem with the attitude of the people who work at Mimi's is not the attitude of the people who work at Mimi's.  I pre-checked the menu at Yelp before I left the house, which is something I do often and the Cowboy Rub Brick Chicken had my name all over it.  It was precisely as described ... the chicken was meaty and moist with a very crispy spiced skin. The plated salad was as expected and the roasted western potatoes were better than expected (and I am not a big potato eater). The half chicken was larger than average. Unfortunately so was the price. At $16 it was on the pricey side for a lunch entrée. Not that it wasn't worth it but I would have expected $4-5 less for that meal.  Our lunch get-together was to catch up on things since we last got together so we lingered for about 2 hours. No problem at all with the restaurant staff, at no time did we ever feel rushed. Based on my recent visit (and considering that this is a chain restaurant) I would have no problem returning in the future and I recommend this place."}
{"text":"As always, Mimi's never fails to please. Corn chowder was creamy and flavorful. Tuna melt was perfectly browned and seasoned and the coffee is exceptional. Stacy was a very efficient, friendly server.  Mimi's is a regular stop for me when I am out shopping. Love this place."}
{"text":"Good diner-ish joint. Serves breakfast all day and drinks. Polite staff, quick service and comfy booths. Good place for a meeting, has something on the menu for everyone. The food wasn't remarkable but for the price I'm not made. Cute outside patio, next time I'll sit outside weather permitting. Seems like a reliable place to get a quick bit."}
{"text":"Seated quickly. Waited on equally fast. Breakfast special was a peaches and cream pancakes. Tasty. Tasted like peach cobbler."}
{"text":"We had a meeting  catered by Mimi's. I had no control over what was ordered. Some brilliant person decided to order turkey dinner a week before Thanksgiving. WTH? Ok fine, let me start my Thanksgiving early. Why not?  We got turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy and cranberry sauce. I ate the turkey and mashed potatoes and gravy. Some people in our group decided to eat something else and not touch the catered food from Mimi's. I should have done the same. I was sick for a week until Thanksgiving day (and so were the other unsuspecting victims). Damn, you turkey! You destroyed my stomach!  All the other times I've eaten at this location (and other locations) were just alright. Nothing really stands out from their menu. A few pounds lighter, I'd like to thank who ever handled/cooked the food at our meeting for not letting me gain any holiday weight. I doubt I'll ever eat/order food from there again...unless if I want to lose weight quick without even trying."}
{"text":"It's no wonder a lot of Mimi's are going out of business.  Not much has changed since my 2013 review.  Had the same issue with the soup not coming out first, even though my server asked if I wanted that to happen.  When he served the main course, I asked what happened to the soup....he said he forgot and would bring me muffins....I said I didn't want muffins, I wanted my soup.  So yet again, do I eat the soup first and let my meal get cold or the meal first and the soup get cold.  Again, if the restaurant was busy, I could understand the mix up....but it was not.  I wonder how much longer this location will be in business..."}
{"text":"The servings are huge!! I love their carrot cake, that's one of the reasons why i like it here. My mom loves their salmon with chardonnay sauce and my dad loves their meatloaf. Chicken parmesan is also good!"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed; especially considering the :30 min. wait. I thought the breakfast menu was interesting but certainly not a lot of variety of options. And when you throw in the price, I thought they were expensive in relation to the porportions.   The Farmers Tacos were good but again not worth $10.99. The egg/bacon kids special was weak as well."}
{"text":"Found hair in my food I went to eat with my son and both plates have hair on it and no manager said  anything or do anything"}
{"text":"The breakfast is good and the staff is friendly, but my favorite part of this place is they bring a complimentary snack plate for the kids to keep them busy until the food comes."}
{"text":"We had a work meeting here for a group of 9. The service during lunchtime was very poor. Asked for a drink and after 20 minutes it still hadn't arrived. Rarely got refills. When we called ahead our team leader asked for separate checks and it was brought as one full check. We had to wait quite a bit of time to have it corrected, and then each person who paid with a card had to wait a while to get the card back. I only had a sandwich and fruit, and I thought the fruit side was lacking. I enjoyed the pineapple but there was one small slice of that, two small slices of oranges (almost smaller than a garnish), some grapes, and a huge melon piece (melons are the lame filler of any fruit medley, if you ask me). Probably won't come back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is okay, the $18 steak was chewy and tough. The French dip was very boring. The calamari was good."}
{"text":"I went to Mimi's for their French Onion soup. It has always been one of my favorites. I should have just had a bowl of it. Instead I also ordered their chicken pot pie. It was very bland and had no real flavor to it. It was also extremely hot  to the point that I didn't start eating it until my husband was almost done with his dinner  Needless to say I didn't eat the whole thing. Our waiter Serge was extremely slow and very impersonal.  I'm not sure but I think he was over the bar as well. The only reason I'm not giving just one star is that I really enjoy their French onion soup."}
{"text":"We went here after our movie last night, the waiter was friendly and made suggestions we all liked. He seemed to be the only waiter and still kept up with our needs. We will defiantly be going back"}
{"text":"Consistently good breakfast....coffee is always hot...not bitter....excellent baked goods.  This part of town doesn't have all that many mom and pop places, so Mimi's was the best option.  Eggs cooked to order, corned beef hash was excellent service good as well.  Coffee was excellent as well.  A good breakfast experience....didn't hurt that there was a major babe sitting at the counter eating.....I decided to linger over breakfast after she arrived."}
{"text":"This is not the easiest review I've had to write. I want so bad to love this place and it has several lovable qualities. But it also has several dis-likable and even hate-able  qualities.  The decor is super nice. Naulins' in Charlotte for sure. Not overly busy like an Applebee's or similar, but lots of interesting stuff to look at. The hostess was nice and got us to a table quickly which we appreciated. Our server was smiley and pretty attentive but almost blase' about service.  The food is where we start really running into problems. We hit that joint on a hungry Sunday morn. We ordered drinks and my dad even mentioned how the menu pics really did a great job of selling the dishes. At our table we ordered a couple of plates of Choc Chip pancakes (fer the youngens), a Crab-cake Benedict, a Florentine Benedict, a 2 egg and bacon plate and the New Orleans omelet (Pork-apalloza would be a fair name as it had bacon, ham, sausage and andoille in it) I also ordered chipotle sauce to slather my porky beast with.   My wife enjoyed the crabcake dish but the size was somewhat underwhelming. My sis-in-law loved the Florentine with the fresh spinach and hollandaisse, the eggs and bacon was reasonable and my omelet was tasty. The pancake review from my 11 year old was less than stellar when he said that Bob Evens pancakes were better.  Here's the not so good stuff.   My wife's plate came with green leaf lettuce as a garnish, unfortunately the lettuce was nasty! Brown and slimy at the tip. Really unappealing. Was not caught by the cook who put it there, the expediter or the waitress and food runners that helped. It really was nasty.  Though its a nice touch that some of the meals come with what I believe is a house-made muffin, they are really not that great. The Chocolate Mousse muffin was passable but not memorable except in it's passable-ness.  As I've mentioned before in another review, if you make something a flagship item, then that mother better be AWESOME, not passable.   As aforementioned, the server was a little blase' about service. I asked for a cup of ice to thin down my very good but thick orange juice which took way too long to receive. My dad asked for extra butter with his toast (they served 2 slices of toast with one butter pat) which first, took a while and then they gave him 4. Underkill and then overkill. Then at finishing time it took a several minutes to get the check and then I got to watch her do way to many things rather than pay out the check and get me my change. I can dig it when I server does their job in a seemingly calm and together manner, but when they can do it in that manner and get stuff done quickly it's magical. No magic this Sunday.    Here's the hate-able: Boxed frozen taters! REALLY! And not nearly enough even if they were good. My wife and I were blown away by the quality of the potato's (Not really a hash brown but rather a cubed potato thing lightly seasoned with an orange colored seasoning.) No self respecting breakfast joint should ever consider this as an option.  So, not great, but also not awful. Too much Meh to give it a 4 star but not enough Meh to give it 2. I won't go out of my way to get there but will not turn down a free meal there.   Eat well my friends! V-Dub"}
{"text":"We came here on a BOGO, MEH, this place is very hit and miss, while we have had good experiences here before, based on today's visit... 2 stars...  So the eggs Benedict that is typically served on a muffin/biscuit whatever thingy, Out of the 3 choices, apparently the one for cornbeef hash version I picked it's the only one that does not... Disappointed... Although the menu did not state that it was on a muffin as it did with the other 2 benidicts.  The taste was odd, blame it on being French? Blame it on me being fussy? Blame it on an error of composition by the chef who knows?   I expected it to be on a biscuit, just like every other Benedict I've ever had....   James had yummy breakfast taco's they were very good. Coffee was very earthy, would probably grow hair on your chest or something....  I love the chicken crepes here, so in our experience there is good and bad and dependent on what you order very hit and miss...  Even between dinner and breakfast options there is a very clear hit and miss options on both dining times...  This one is more of a live and learn experience."}
{"text":"They were kind enough to substitute sliced Turkey in the 1/2 French Dip  sandwhich for me. I had a spinach salid and a fruit cup..... just enough. It's a little tough to watch the calories here, but the menu has all the numbers, so that helps."}
{"text":"Found hair on both of plates I order and nobody did anything about it waitress was slow didn't come for refills on our drinks and order was not ass I ask for like I ask for side of salsa and crisp waffle so waffle was soft and never came to see if everything was ok. Found 2 hairs and I never saw the manager or nothing"}
{"text":"I myself will Never go back to this place. Lemon automatically in water. I'm not a tree!Cold food! Waitress could Not remember who ordered what. Coffee was good. Manager comped 1/2 the bill on a party of 11.Makes you wonder what in the world is going on, and How many times this happens a day."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a long time, my last experience was for dinner and wasn't that good, so we stopped going all together. I've been having cravings for their Pain Perdue (french toast filled with cream cheese and marmalade!) breakfast, so when I got the chance to chose a place to eat breakfast, I jumped on Mimi's. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as I had remembered. Service was a bit slow for a Tuesday morning and only about 3 other tables were occupied in the restaurant. My Pain Perdue was good but I feel the French toast could've been grilled more. My bacon was a bit under done as well. The scrambled eggs were fine. My meal was okay. My husband got the 5 Alarm Omelet...well it was 1 alarm at best, and a bit small in size. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and cooked nicely. He chose the Lemon Poppyseed muffin on the side, it was very heavy and dense, more like a pound cake. Very much lacking in lemon flavor also. Neither of us liked it. After 2 meals here that were nothing special, I doubt I'll be going back. Well maybe for some of their Carrot Cake:)"}
{"text":"The place was clean and the menu is large and they have breakfast, lunch and dinner...   It just old people food, not a lot of flavor or pazzazz..  We will be back, we have old people in our family!"}
{"text":"Mimi's in Henderson provided fabulous muffins for our Saturday Morning Live Toastmasters event, right before Thanksgiving. With help from Damon and Mark at Mimi's, we were able to showcase what we offer to aspiring leaders, and provide an amazing brunch! Great food makes all the difference at an event. Plus, Mark and Damon supported us with a food donation in the midst of their already busy holiday season, when it would have been easy to say no. This place deserves our business, and you can't go wrong with the food. Thank you, Damon and Mark!"}
{"text":"We normally like Mimi's but there were 4 of us and none of us liked our food. I had a omelette and it had spinach in it and the chunks were to big for me and the eggs were yucky to runny. The only thing good was my blueberry muffin. Also the prices at mimi's are high I think $3.29 is crazy for a cup of coffee. Our waitress had no personality and was alittle snippy. For my breakfast which was the omelette and a cup of coffe and one muffin to go was $19.02 then I had to tip for a meal that was no good I was not full left most all of it on my plate I hate when that happens."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our server that didn't know the menu to the error in our order and mediocre food. We won't be stopping here again going through the area. There are many restaurants in this area wish we would have tried some place else."}
{"text":"Special combination prices on the menu, get two or three courses for one price. You can order a soup or salad and an entree and if you go for the three course a dessert.   I ordered the two course with tomato bisque soup and chicken crepes.  I absolutely love the tomato bisque soup! They let you buy it by the quart if you want for an extra $5.  The crepes were a light and blanketed the grilled chicken and spinach with wonderful flavor.  It also comes with a salad, so the meal was complete for me, no dessert necessary.  Good service, great food, good deals!"}
{"text":"My boo and I were about to leave because we waited to be seated for 10 minutes and no one had approached us until finally Danielle a waitress greeted and seated us. Then afterwards she took our order and took care of us. Poor thing was every where doing everything in the kitchen to on the floor. She is amazing and so sweet. 5 stars to Danielle but 4 stars because of the wait"}
{"text":"Great service. Clam chowder is full of, wait for it, clams! Chicken pistachio salad is great. Who doesn't love the muffins? Sad today. No chocolate chip ones but the spice one was as good."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice menu, friendly staff yet the place confuses the hell out of me. I was craving crepes after seeing the item on their online menu...what I did not care for wa seeing that they were filled with orange marmalade cream cheese...  So I asked the server if I could have the crepes with the mixed berries and strawberry puree instead and she said that the crepes were already made and pre-filled. Well that's awfully odd as the menu states \"Made to Order Crepes\"...so I asked her again and she checked with the kitchen and they were able to make the crepes just the way I wanted them.  I know...lots of drama for nothing.  My friend and I waited a rather long time for anyone to come to our table to get our drink order...However, when someone finally came...we got our drinks after a few minutes and our food came in no time at all. The food was tasty and the orange juice was great. All in all, it was okay but only three stars in my book."}
{"text":"Ok, so we all know when you go to a restaurant on a major holiday, you should probably lower your expectations, as it's a really busy day for them.  We were a large party with 8 adults and 5 children, so again, I went in not expecting greatness, but at least hoping for competent service and decent food. We received neither.  The 1 star is only for the poor waitress who wound up getting our party after the original server was either cut or moved to another section. She tried really hard and she was pleasant.  The original server was put off by the fact we asked for regular menus. She told us \"You can order anything off the menu, but it will take a lot longer to come out if it's not on the \"special\" Mother's Day menu.\" Really? In my only other experience with a restaurant on a special occasion (Thanksgiving 2017), that establishment's attitude was \"Of course, you can get anything you want.\". On that day, pnly 2 in our party chose from the holiday menu and that restaurant was still able to get all of our food out at the same time, at the correct temperature and tasting delicious.  We sat for a long time with empty glasses. No one came by to offer refills. Finally, the new waitress who took over our party was able to get us tea and soda refills.  The sad thing is, the restaurant really wasn't that busy (probably should have been a good clue that we should try someplace else).  When the food finally arrived, there were many things wrong. My mother-in-law's salmon was completely uncooked. I joked if she wanted sushi, I'd have gladly taken her up the street to my favorite sushi spot. My mother's turkey royale sandwich was served on bread that was probably baked around Christmas time. It was completely stale and dried out. My french dip sandwich didn't contain roast beef at all, but rather 2 small sad slices of mystery meat and 1 slice of burned bacon. Neither of these proteins should EVER appear on a french dip sandwich. I didn't bother to sample the mystery meat, it was a grayish-tan and probably either pork or turkey. The sandwich was also haphazardly thrown together.  As a family, we'd been going to various Mimi's locations in 3 different states for over 20 years. Sadly, after this visit, I will not be going back (we also had a similar poor experience at a Mimi's in California in November 2017). There are just so many better places."}
{"text":"Alright. Originally we were gonna go to B-Dubs across the way, but we decided...why not? Let's give MiMis a try.   First off. The dark ambient lighting. Really dim. Kinda gave off the vibe.  I ordered the Half whole chicken. Presentation was nothing like the picture. But none the less, looked good. Chicken, very tender. Light skin, and very very light flavor. I don't I've ever had to add salt and pepper from the table to any plate I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  Plus side. The fries were pretty dam good though.   The other plate we ordered was the steak. Actually, very well cooked, it wasn't half bad. (7/10) BUT. We did find a piece of plastic wrapper on the fries. So that really was a turn off.  Other then that, we should have went to b-dubs instead."}
{"text":"This location absolutely sucks!   It took forever for our table to get greeted and another forever for us to get our drinks..  Once our appetizers came we got fried zucchini and I personally got a side Caesar salad.... the romaine lettuce was old (I still ate it because I was starving) and towards the end of my salad I was jabbed in my mouth by a piece of PLASTIC! We waited for someone/ anyone to walk by at this point to ask for a manager...tired of waiting I stood up to find someone....  The manager finally comes over and I explain everything and she tells us right off the bat \"I am so sorry we will pay for everything, did we get our entree's yet\" we explain to her \"no\" she goes to check, and our food comes out. The manager then says \"I'm really sorry about everything and things are a little hectic here not that, that is an excuse, but I'm really sorry\"....... we thought that would be the end of things but guess what ALL OUR FOOD WAS COLD!!!!  By the way, the restaurant was not whatsoever busy... I work in the restaurant industry and I would've been understanding if it was crazy busy in here but it was not and this was the worst service plus food I've ever had. I wanted to have a nice family dinner and this ruined our night"}
{"text":"Used to love Mimis. Today we walked in and the hostess didn't greet us or say a word to us. Talk about a warm welcome. We finally said two even though we weren't asked. And, we then decided to sit at the bar which was filthy. At one point the bartender was arguing with a waitress. We will never return."}
{"text":"First time I've been here. It was pretty slow, so we were quickly seated and greeted. Derrick, our waiter, was a nice guy that took our order quickly and recommended the pumpkin spice muffin to me as part of my meal. (I'm a white girl, so pumpkin spice was a good choice, haha). The drinks were quick, I got hot chamomile tea which was soothing and the boyfriend got iced tea.  To order, I had the hickory smoked bacon and eggs and he got orange marmalade stuffed pancakes. The muffin that I got with my meal was piping hot, fresh and tasted delicious with the cream cheese on top. Honestly, one of the best muffins I've ever had.  The food came out shortly after, and was also piping hot and fresh. My entreé came with seasoned potatoes that I didn't expect and they were perfect. Seasoned well and everything. Eggs were cooked to my taste and the bacon was hickory smoked indeed.  My boyfriend said that his marmalade pancakes were sweet, but not too sweet, and the side of eggs and bacon that came with it (not another order!) complemented the dish well.  Overall, great experience and will be back for more."}
{"text":"What happens when a Croatian family, 2 gays and a brood of CenPho peeps head to the westside for a birthday brunch at...*gasp*...a chain restaurant. Well, I'll tell ya what happens. Big Fun. That's what! We had at least 20 people and took over an entire room in back. That was smart of them as we were a \"lively\" group. Granted it took quite a while to get drinks out to us, but I'm a restaurant person and forgive easier than others. We had strawberry mimosas served with a split of Freixenet. Fantastic! I had the cordon blue crepes with ham, Swiss, onion and eggs topped with Dijon cream sauce...seriously...they were heavenly. I was last to be served so I was nervous my crepes would be petrified. They were piping hot! Also on my plate were fresh grapes. They were chilled & snappy. Kind of like Angelina Joilie's personality. I have to say the place was pretty messy, including the restroom, which oddly smelled like the men's restroom at the Esplanade. I'll remember you Mimi. Next year, when I'm visiting the westside again, I may swing by for those crepes. Oh. One weird thing happened. After a few of us had ordered our third strawberry mimosa, we were told they had no more champagne left. Really? Cuz it feels like you're cutting us off! Whatev! We had consumed plenty but got a chuckle out of being cut off in a room full of coffee swilling seniors!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad service. It may have been just the waiter but service was slow.  Our meals took forever to get to the table. The salmon was cooked too long or sat too long. Member at the table ordered salad, and the waiter brought it with dinner. Wouldn't you at least ask if you want it with your meal. The other waiters and waitress were in the room many more times than our waiter. I always tip very well because I understand they do work hard but our service was sub par."}
{"text":"We have been going there weekly for a business network meeting in the wee hours of the mornning. I have also ordered a vege omlette and it's pretty amazing! Their sausage is good too as it's not a little link like other places. Our waitress does a good job to our 22 businesses there."}
{"text":"Wow. I will start by saying, I have been coming to this establishment for two years now, ever since I have lived in Charlotte. It has never been the most astounding choice for brunch, but more of a convenient meeting place for all of the family members coming from different parts of town, needing different interstates to head to homes out of town, etc.  but never has an experience been as horrid as yesterday's Sunday brunch. I will start with the hostess. She was rude with an extremely poor attitude. We told her we had 3 adults and two children that need high chairs.   She coldly told us she needed to check on that. She came back saying, well I have one high chair and one booster seat. My niece and nephew are 14 months old and far too wiggly for booster seats. We state we will wait until availability of second high chair but are told she has no clue when that will be, not offering up any professional apologies, timelines, or resolutions.  After deciding to bite the bullet and sit before the second high chair was available, we politely ask to be seated at a table rather than a booth, for ease of getting the kiddos fed, etc. She looked at us like we had just asked her to jump off a bridge. She then proceeds to seat us.... at a booth. We let this slide feeling we have requested enough at this point.   The table right next to us also had a child in a high chair, and when combined with our high chair, left little walkway room for waiters and customers. Waiters would stare at us like it was our decision to place children in this location and talked to us like we were such an annoyance to be paying customers at this facility. Clearly they have the mindset of \" I just work here\" and have no professionalism whatsoever, as well as blatantly lacking maturity or manners.   After my niece was getting extremely wiggly and we were having a hard time figuring out how we would handle meal time, we reminded the staff we needed a high chair about 15 minutes after being seated.  We were then given yet another standoff attitude that still produced no answers. There was a third table in our area that had a high chair and that family was departing. We asked a waitress if it was possible to have that high chair because we had been waiting for one. She literally huffed and puffed to the point I was concerned this little woman was going to hyperventilate. She then said not even one single word as she slammed the high chair right beside where my nephew was sitting in his, then walked off.   We now have three children in high chairs back to back, the three of them actually becoming being silly and baby talking back and forth  with each other due to the close proximity.   My sister and the mother of the other child were very frustrated with such poor care given to families and my boyfriend and I were continuously ready to jump up and swat away a hot plate/beverage/food item that at any point could drop on these kids heads due to the poor excuse of staff members carrying hot food OVER the children's heads as they squeezed through the narrow spot. I wouldn't trust these waiters with a guinea pig much less carrying scalding plates above three toddlers heads.   We uncomfortably rushed through our poorly prepared meal and I tipped out of the extreme deep down goodness of my heart for this tragic service. Wait staff is horrid, food is abysmal, and the manager seemed like he didn't know what the heck was happening in his \"store\" either. I will never be back, ever. Ever ever ever. Absolutely not. What a poor excuse of a professional establishment."}
{"text":"Why do I have to constantly ask for bread? It's complimentary, and I always see everyone else eating it around me. Is it just me? Service here is hit and miss, and mostly miss. I've had very rude waiters who deserved no tip from being extremely hostile and snotty. There's no reason to freak out on people over how they order- if you can't handle that, find a different job. Their food is NOT New Orleans style or themed- yet the place is crawling with Mardi Gras decor.  The food is overpriced for what you get- and it isn't that great. The best thing they have, for me, is their grilled cheese sandwich. What makes it good is that they grill Parmesan cheese on the outside, giving it a nice crunch. But I can make that at home, and make it less greasy too.  My poor boyfriend had the luck of getting screwed over by a waiter (the last time we ever went to Mimi's). He had a coupon, and gave it to her- she never applied it. So it is useless to sign up for their e-club, since they never really send you good deals (just junk mail) and don't apply it."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing experience here. Our server Tammy was more then pleasant with her very kind demeanor. Its hard being a closing server with a smile on your face and it was just so natural for her. Will return soon great food. Definitely recommend artichoke dip that was amazing."}
{"text":"Never though I'd come here. But I'm glad I did. Great breakfast selection, loved my strawberry waffles. It was delicious!!! Our server was good. Super patient with my 2 year old. :)"}
{"text":"The best turkey dinner around!  Fresh! The turkey was hand carved, vegetables were steamed fresh!  Outstanding food as always, no matter what one we have gone too!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING here.  Such a fun, quirky restaurant.  The decorations are adorable!  Fresh food, made to order.  The coffee is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Mimi's was my lifesaver! no really, she was...Just arrived in Las Vegas and I was eager to get some grub in my tum.  My close friend picked me up from the airport and we were both ready to eat a good breakfast meal.  It had been a long overnight flight and let's just say, sleep... was minimal.   It was a great place that my good friend suggested cuz we were both hungry AND excited to catch up with each other.    Located just outside Las Vegas it has ample parking and a french charm to it.  From the entrance to the inside...it's really got a warm feeling to it.  We sat down and our waitress came pretty quickly, we both got orange juice and I had mocha cappuccino.  For breakfast I had the eggs florentine benedict which I opted for fruit instead of the potatoes.  Don't remember what my friend ordered but I know her's came with a muffin--- she got the carrot raisin muffin, which was YUmmy!! I liked the two different flavors and they seemed to really go together and complement each other.  My benedict was the perfect size for my appetite.  The side fruit wasn't that sweet but the benedict really made up for that.  They're one of my favorite breakfast meals and Mimi's really delivered on taste & quality.    My ultimate favorite here was the coffee! It was incredibly delicious, not too strong and not to sweet.  Perfect for a great breakfast with my girl friend and with a wonderful breakfast.  I'm looking forward to coming back to Mimi's for breakfast, and perhaps I'll try the potatoes---they looked worth a try.   Yelp 365 challenge:  57/ 365"}
{"text":"Being in Charlotte on business for two weeks, I gave Mimi's a try three times.  After three times I decided not to go back.  The food is just ok.  Don't go expecting a WOW experience.  Food presentation is not bad, but taste and price could be much better..."}
{"text":"We always eat here when we have a coupon. You have to purchase drinks too. This time I had the salmon entree with spinach and potatoes. It was delicious and just the right portion size. Granted it is Atlantic salmon, but that's okay. The hubby had brick chicken. I could eat here once a month and be happy. One word of caution: the \"butter\" served with rolls was a mix of margarine and butter and I had to ask for real butter."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. Excellent food. Friendly welcoming staff. Nice atmosphere. This is modern bistro food, not a diner but has many of the classics presented in an updated way."}
{"text":"We came to Mimis an hour before they closed Tamra was awesome and very polite! Kept a smile on her face. Would definitely come back. They ran out of half chicken at the time but she recommended many other entries to choose from she was great!"}
{"text":"This isn't a restaurant that I frequent but stop in occasionally.  The food is okay, pretty good if you just want a general meal with some comfort food.  Service on the other hand is seriously lacking which is the basis for the 2 star review.  On this most recent trip the waitress has a short attitude right from the start, never checked back to refill my wife's glass or just see if we needed anything, and made a mistake on our bill by not applying the coupon code even though I gave it to her right away."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" just about sums up Mimi's breakfast.   I've been here before for lunch, and remember liking it.  I had a salad with crab cakes, and a cappuccino.  Everything was good. My boyfriend, and I decided to try this place for breakfast.  I had eggs Benedict.  They were really runny.  The whites hadn't even set.  My boyfriend had an omelet.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really inspiring either.  It would have been better if it wasn't quite so dry, and it would have been excusable if the price wasn't nearly 10 dollars each dish.  When I pay that much for eggs, I generally expect some kind of quality.  Same goes for the mimosa I ordered.  For $7 a glass, I'd expect at least Korbel.  I couldn't recognize the brand that they were serving, and although it was still very enjoyable,  it definitely wasn't anything special.     The service wasn't anything to write home about either.  When my boyfriend left for a few minutes, the waitress ran up, and snatched his plate.  There was a lot of food on it that we were planning on taking home.  I asked her for a box, and she went to get one.  I shook my head, and turned my attention back to my potatoes just to realize that she snatched the ketchup, and all of the condiments off the table while I was still eating.    I would give Mimi's 2 stars, but I'm adding one because their lunch is usually better."}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge us, he took another 15 minutes to bring drinks. We tried to order and were told we had an old version of the menu and that what we wanted was no longer an option. Honey asked if he could substitute fries for a salad and was told no, but he could up charge order a salad. So we asked for more time, and he stated fine, he'd bring us a bread basket while we waited. 15 minutes later we finished ordering and got our bread basket. Sadly, the carrot raisin bread isn't great anymore. The baguettes were ok. When we finally got our food it was just ok. The steak was gristly, but the butter made up for that. The fries were super over cooked. The pot roast was bland - not nearly enough sauce. The au gratin potatoes and green beans made up for the lack of flavor in the meat. We never got our  drinks refilled. It wasn't super busy, but our waiter was definitely scatterbrained. Tried giving this location another chance, but we won't be back. Too many other great options in this area for bad service, old menus, and bland food."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning.  The food was spot on as usual.   Always busy which is great to see.  We had the absolute pleasure of having Brooke as our server this morning. Brooke is a newbie to  Mimi's but not to the Restaurant business.  My husband really enjoyed her too.    We will be back to see Brooke and to enjoy another delicious meal.  Dawn and Mark  Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with friends, had the quiche, as another did also had the croissant and another the cinnamon French toast. All of us were full and satisfied, and full. Would have no problem going back."}
{"text":"One of mine and my boyfriends favorite date spots! Mimis always has the best food, and they bring out yummy bread for you to snack on before your main courses come out. You cant go wrong with any of the food there its all great!!"}
{"text":"Not sad place to eat.bring a sweater because it's chilly inside.all of the staff is in long sleeves and a lot are wearing sweaters or jackets."}
{"text":"I got a chicken sandwich with avocados & wasn't really impressed. Our server was slow & forgetful too."}
{"text":"I just keep being impressed by this restaurant no matter what state I am in. The service is always excellent, the place is always clean and well organized and the food is usually good. I love the 5 dollar happy hour which seems to be all the time-meaning whatever time I pop in I can get a 5 dollar glass or 20 dollar bottle. Not bad at all for a good restaurant.  The food is also good, but I suggest sticking to their soups (tomato basil and corn chowder are my favorite) and sandwiches like the tuna melt or grilled cheese because they are awesome. I did have the BBQ burger here once as well but I was not impressed really. So as long as you stay away from the red meat here you really can't go wrong. Their food is usually always on point.  The servers at this Mimi's are my favorite, super personable, friendly and fast. We never wait for a table or long for our food here which I personally love about Mimi's. I have had servers give us exceptional service at this location too, so I will be back if only for the service and the grilled cheese with tomato soup! Delicious!@!!!!!"}
{"text":"The place has gone downhill. Smaller everything and higher prices. Service was prompt and friendly.  We came in on Saturday morning. Years ago you would have to wait to be seated, today we walked right in. Go next door to Babystacks."}
{"text":"good food. a bit over priced. I usually order the turkey dinner. it comes with stuffing. Last time I got it i had about one tablespoon full of stuffing. I was pretty disappointed they jipped me on my serving but still good overall."}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed with our visit to Mimi's Cafe this evening.  It started out with our waitress introducing a second waitress who was in training, selling it that we'd have twice the help.  Truth is, we had less help than expected.  Service was pretty slow, but the bigger issue I had was with the ordinary food.    I ordered the roasted turkey dinner.  It looked and tasted like an upgraded TV dinner, only larger.  The slices were perfect like them came from the frozen package that way.  The potatoes were ordinarily and all I could think about during the meal was \"Is this at all better than a TV dinner?\"   It wasn't bad.  It wasn't good either.  It was simply  not what I expect from Mimi's - which is usually delicious."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 5 because our server was attentive, polite and very friendly to my family. The kitchen always seems so behind but as long as my food comes out HOT and correct I usually don't fuss.  Friendly people all around :-)"}
{"text":"I came to Mimi's with a friend on a slow weekday morning. There weren't many people.  I had been once before and enjoyed the food and the LA atmosphere. During this particular visit we walked in and no host could be found...we waited and waited. Finally someone came out and brought us to our seat. Our waitress was SLOW. On three occasions I was about to get up and find her to tell her we were ready to order. After my friend ordered, she turned to me and said \"And what would you like young man?\" I kindly stated that I was a female and she began to argue with me about how she didn't say anything wrong. I have long hair and was wearing makeup!! My friend witnessed she called me a male and stated so...no apology just more denials.  Finally, we got up to leave. Having served in the military as a female I definitely  notice when people accidentally call me a title by the opposite gender.  No class on the waitress' part..no apology and didn't seem to care that we left. Bad customer service in an area where there are so many other restaurants that will treat you well!"}
{"text":"went here for lunch because it was someplace I used to eat many years ago in Los Angeles.    It was not nearly as good as I remember it being, however it was cheap.  I ordered the grilled  salmon dish on the \"Just Enough\" menu, which was flavorful and was as good as something I would expect from a similar place like the Cheesecake Factory.  Being from Seattle and having had incredible salmon, I wish they would tell me where their salmon comes from, and the waiter could not tell me.  Yes I'm a salmon snob.  Don't hate.    My husband had the french onion soup and it was the worst soup we've ever ate.  It was just some chicken broth with undercooked onions and a little cheese and bread on top.  It was horrid.    He also had a Parmesan Chicken Ciabatta, and although he thought the flavor of the chicken was ordinary, he loved the ciabatta bread.  It is very cheap so we might go here again.  There are so many better dining options around town that I doubt we will."}
{"text":"We are at the diner counter and had a awesome service from Denise!  Great positive and on the ball service!  Food was wonderful and fresh. Nice unique breakfast out. Lovely mimosa as well."}
{"text":"This was really just a disappointment.  The hostess told us it was a 10 minute wait even through there were over a dozen tables empty, our wait ended up being only about 3.  The server was polite, but the food was really mediocre. The food came out at different times.  The eggs were cold. The fish was generic (frozen, possibly Mrs. Paul's), and the fries were floppy and stale. The tarter sauce was possibly the worst I've ever had.  Top it off with high prices (which it's not worth), I'd say avoid it if you possibly can."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and some other friends while I was visiting Arizona. The place isn't that bad during lunch since I've never came here for lunch before. My boyfriend is always saying how they have delicious muffins, but I didn't believe him until we went and I ordered their blueberry muffin. He knew I loved blueberry muffins... And Mimi's truly had one of the better blueberry muffins! =D I was very pleased that they were able to appease my craving for BB muffins!  Although the other foods were all right... After I ate it, I literally had the biggest food coma of my life. T___T But all the same, the food was good (I had the chipotle chicken sandwich with fries), very typical of a chain restaurant. But I really enjoyed their quiet atmosphere and their pleasant services. Our waiter was really polite and he always had smile on his face when he came to check on us. He even took our comments on the food to the chef and made sure we were compensated for it (though we told him it was alright). Overall, the visit to Mimi's was somewhat of an eyeopener for me in the service department and I really enjoyed having lunch there. =D"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my family. I had the salmon Benedict and it was basically a lox but with hollandaise sauce and poached eggs. It was delicious and also had a berry mimosa. Waiter was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here recently and we enjoyed our meal as usual.  We typically are not disappointed at Mimi's.  I had the salad & soup duet with the corn chowder and the fall harvest salad.  It also came with a muffin and I had the carrot raisin muffin.  Everything was very tasty.  I really liked the mustard vinaigrette on the salad.  The soup was warm, chunky and tasty.  Its my favorite soup they offer.  My mom had the half sandwich & soup duet with grilled cheese and onion soup.  She enjoyed the soup but thought the sandwich was a bit mushy.  It could have been a bit crisper but she did like the taste.  I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. It seemed like an upscale Bob's Big Boy restaurant. The waitress was aloof. The place flipped me out to say the least. Super weird time in there."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very cozy and inviting. The servers are friendly and courteous. I recommend the quiche and seafood bouillabaisse. Very tasty comfort food! Come early for lunch for a more quiet ambience!"}
{"text":"I did not have the best experience.I visited on December 16th at about 4pm. There were not many customers. In my section a total of about 8 people. There other side of the restaurant was about the same. I ordered a brie burger and fries, and soup. My soup was great. My burgers was not cooked just right, but was cold. It took forever to get waited on and then, another forever for my food to come out. My fries seemed to be refried and the burger was microwaved.. it took less then 5 minutes to make the adjustment. But took more than 10 minutes to receive the original order.  Just not a good experience and that was my last visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome....one of the best ever.  easy parking.  user friendly.  great staff, fabulous food.  register as a frequent flyer and you two for one offers all the time, and a free birthday meal or desert.  The breads and muffins are too good.....family friendly."}
{"text":"Being hypercritical I find some experiences are better than others. Tonight a friend and I had a great dinner, we loved the French onion soup, enjoyed our warm spinach appetizer, and roasted chicken crepes.  What I did enjoy the most was the great service we received from Jessica. She was an absolute gem!   One thing I did notice, that I brought to Jessica's attention was a large tear in the carpet. This was a poor sight to see, a hazard not only for customers but for employees as well. Even something so simple as putting it down with duct tape, while it wouldn't be aesthetically pretty, it would be much better than seeing the large tear.   Again, I still give our visit 5 stars for the food & service."}
{"text":"Food good, service good also. However needed our winter coats! We asked several times to change temperatures. They did but didn't stay long. If you are cold blooded, be prepared!"}
{"text":"The food is always is usually good except last time we were there after going there for a few years, my daughter got food poisoned by a grilled chicken that we ordered from the kids menu. It was one of our favorite places up until this happened."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! I can't say enough about the food, service and ambience. After countless mediocre restaurants, you forget what really good food and service are. From the first moment I walked in the restaurant I was greeted in French. The waiter Donna was exceptionally professional, kind and knowledgeable. The flavor of the food woke up my taste buds. The manager came over and greeted me and welcomed me to the restaurant. I can't believe restaurants like this still exist. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not really my kind of place but it was average faire. The food was just average.   The service was slow and just average.   The menu was average.    I ordered the half baked chicken which was average.  It was chicken must have been on a diet because it was a damn skinny bird.  The mashed potatoes were not very warm and I think they were instant.   The veggies were decent enough.    The good part is that we had a two entrees for one coupon.     Some friends of ours love this place so I am pretty sure I will return there."}
{"text":"We really enjoy all the Mimi's but Fernando the manager makes our dinner exceptional. We were disappointed when he left, but now I hope he is back for good. The French onion is the best and the salads are delicious and quite filling. We really appreciate Fernando greeting us and all the others at the door. He knows how to keep a well oiled machine and will not hesitate to serve the tables when very busy, and we can't wait to go back. Also ask for Athena the server she is the best and we always sit in her section"}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant - wide ranging menu, great options, good food, reasonably priced, and great place to bring kids."}
{"text":"Marcus was our waiter. He was polite, courteous, friendly and very attentive to us. The meal was perfect. The omelette was delicious along with the potatoes and the coffee was superb. I'd like to give him more than 5 stars!! #rockstar"}
{"text":"Mimi's is the place to go!! The servers were very friendly an helpful. The portions were really big and you'll be sure to eat all of it! The berry crepes dissolve in your mouth and the chipotle breakfast burrito is the best way to start of your day! Perfect for families that want a nice sit down meal but not spend too much time!"}
{"text":"Went in on 4th of July at around 2pm. The restaurant was close to empty and service was extremely slow. We were greeted by a server who knows my nieces who go there frequently with their dad, but our table was assigned to a different  server who did not greet us for at least 10 minutes. It was 112 degrees out and we were thirsty and didn't even get water for 20 minutes. We finally placed our food and drink order at the same time. The coffee creamer bowl was placed on the rim of the coffee cup and dipped into the coffee itself. Kind of gross. When we asked the server to replace it, she seemed flustered. Food was ok. Server seemed weeded and gave poor service which was odd since the restaurant was near empty. Just not a good experience."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and loved it. I loved the feel of the place. It felt like grandma house. The food was amazing. A bit of southern style. Our waitress (I believe her name was Laura) was great!! We happen the mention that my husband and I would be sharing our meal. She ended up splitting our meal on 2 plates where most places we go and say we're sharing a meal just bring us an extra plate. Great customer service!! Thank you Laura for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"What happened to Mimi's? The menu has changed again and not for the better. We arrived at 9PM and no one was at the door to greet us...for a long time we waited, then I wen tin search of someone. Finally found someone and I asked if they were closed. He said no and sat us. The restaurant was pretty empty. I never saw anyone else on the floor working. The server was not friendly at all. Service very slow. Then again this might be a management problem too since one person cannot do everything in a full service restaurant and do a good job.  I ordered the chicken crepes. They were pictured on menu and looked good. I received a hot plate with cold food. They were actually cold inside so I am not sure if they sat that long or if they are premade and were not heated through.  It took a long time but I finally got the attention of the waiter and asked him to please heat them up.  He grabbed the plate and came back later with them hot. The crepes were still undercooked and mushy but the inside was hot.  The salad was wilted when he returned.  The waiter never said he was sorry or is it better or kiss my behind.  He just dropped it off and went away.  I did eat a couple more bites and decided that I was not willing to eat calories when the food is bad so that was the end of my dinner. My husband had the Tuna Sandwich and it was different then they used  to make it and no longer on the menu that he could find. We waited a long time again. Finally got his attention and asked for the check. He never asked if we wanted dessert or asked if I wanted the mushy mess to take with me, or at least ask what was wrong with it. We finally got the check, paid for it before he could take off again and left. Mimi's used be so good. Maybe the economy has made them cut down on labor to try to make a profit. The bad thing about that is you cut down on service too. I never thought I would prefer IHOP but the food is hot and the service is better."}
{"text":"Here now. Service is slooooow, passive and uncaring.  What was supposed to be a 15 min wait ended in being a 30 min wait.  This is crappy."}
{"text":"They don't have the largest menu selection, and the food's pretty average.   We mostly like going for breakfast, not for dinner, due to the better selection.   There are the usual choices, but everything is done well, with hearty portions.  If you want to mix it up with healthy options like fruit, they can oblige.  The sausage is thick and not greasy, and the country potatoes are too. Strawberry lemonade sounds better than it is since I don't think it's freshly made."}
{"text":"First time here, but never again! I can't comment on the food because we canceled our order and left. Water was dripping from the ceiling in the kitchen onto the food prep area where salads were being prepared. The guy making  salads knocked the bucket over that was set on the counter to catch water and went right back to making food. As we left,  we could see water dripping in several other places near food and onto cutting boards.  I spoke with the manager about what we saw and why we were leaving. (I believe her name was Valerie) She acted like she didn't care and was obviously aware of the situation based on her reaction, or lack there of.  Gross! Unacceptable! Will never step foot here again."}
{"text":"I came here on Monday, and I really enjoyed the food and service I received! The host, and the waitresses were very friendly, attentive, and exceeded my expectations that I had for Mimi's prior to arriving.  Make sure to ask for bread if they don't ask you already, because the madelines are amazing! They were delicious and fresh out of the oven, I ate all of them and asked for a second serving, which was brought out to me within a few seconds! That, I was impressed with.  I ordered chicken and waffles, and it came out to me in under 5 minutes. The chicken was breaded, and crisp, and the waffle was nice and fluffy.  I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Mimi's Cafe's before, but it has been a while.  I have had breakfast there in the past. The new menu is not very appealing. I tried two sandwiches, the 5-Way grilled cheese and the tuna. Both were served on greasy garlic sourdough bread and both were terrible. In fact, we both said \"That was a waste of money on a disgusting lunch.\"  On top of that the service was barely adequate.  If I go back it will not be for lunch, and it will probably be a different Mimi's."}
{"text":"Thought on this cold day 1/2 a sandwich and soup would be ideal. However, i didn't think i would have to wait a half hour. The server although apologetic didn't recognize that she would've had the manager visit the table. It appeared that she was having a hard time keeping up with the amount of tables she had. My husbands burger dry and flavorless. Well at least the bread basket was good."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast this morning. Our waiter was Also the same person who greeted us when we arrived. He was super nice and didn't forget anything.  We ordered a \"fancy\" coffee; mocha latte. Topped with whip cream and cinnamon, a perfect start to the beginning of my day.   I ordered the Lorraine Quiche, the filling was delicious but I wasn't a huge fan of their crust. My husband ordered their jambalaya and he said it was very good. My sons super cute puppy pancake must have been delicious because he ate most of it!   The facility was fairly clean, they could do a little bit of house keeping the blinds were filthy and the bathrooms could use a little upkeep.   Over all it was a very pleasant visit!!  Of course with our buy one get one meal Free was worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times already & it is a nice little spot. It is casual & it is a franchise. But, it's also unique in its own way. It has a very cozy feel to it. The food is very good. Whether you want breakfast, lunch or dinner. The food is always delicious. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip. Almost every restaurant has one. And, I really like their version. My only complaint, was that there were not enough tortilla chips. We asked for more, but we never got them. Our waitress was nice, but I think she had too many tables that night & was overwhelmed. The fresh bread basket was great also. The French rolls were pretty good. But, everybody's favorite was the carrot raisin, I believe that's what it was. I've also have their chocolate chip banana muffin which is amazing. But, if you're going to have that one, save it for dessert. Because, it is sweet & quite rich. Their corn chowder soup is one of the best that I've ever had. I've never even tried a different soup from them, because I love the corn chowder so much. I am a hot tea drinker, & I love that they bring you your own little teapot. Very cute & convenient at the same time. I ordered the bacon & avocado burger which was delicious as always. And, I really love their fries. They definitely taste like they cut them there. I definitely don't taste as if they were once frozen. Overall, it's a cute & casual place to go to. It's fairly inexpensive I would say. But, still rather delicious."}
{"text":"My visiting out-of-towners, extended family aren't really adventurous eaters, despite the fact they have a ton of places to choose from in Vegas, of all places, to eat. We decided on Mimi's since it's kinda like Chili's - everybody will be able to find something to eat.   I went here on August 19th around 8:30ish PM.   The place was completely dead yet it still took a good 10 minutes for a table to be set up for 9 of us (we were seated at a large round table.)   I don't know why,  but for an empty place, we sure got terrible service. I got one refill despite us being there more than an hour and a half. I wasn't the only one at the table with the lack of refill. Nobody would take away our dishes either, so we were stacking all our bread plates, salad plates, dinner plates, trash, bread baskets, and empty cups on the lazy susan so we'd have enough room on the table to eat. I have the picture to prove it too.  I tried to order my usual - the kid's meal turkey dinner, no potatoes, double stuffing, with an unsweetened ice tea. Nope, the waitress wouldn't let me because I'm not under 12. I hate these age restrictions on menus - especially since I've ordered this a million times to go back in Cali. I ended up ordering the French Dip with no sides, just a side salad, no croutons with ranch. After picking out the croutons, the salad was fine.   It took a long time for the meals to come out, and my sister and aunt only ordered french onion soup - and for some reason, they had to wait about 10 minutes after everybody else's food to come out to get their soups. We eat as a family so our food was getting cold waiting for their meals to come out. My French Dip came with cole slaw that I didn't order - BLEH. It was gross (I hate cole slaw, so I'm biased.) I took half of my sandwich home and tried to wrap it in a paper doily I found in the bread basket to protect it from the nasty cole slaw that my dad said he'd eat. I ended up throwing out the bread and just eating the meat off of the sandwich the next day. Meh.  For 9 of us to eat (2 of the meals were kids' meals,  2 French onion soups, 2 adult turkey dinners, 1 broiled chicken dish, 1 beef dish and a French dip sandwich) it was about $105 and they still couldn't clear off the table or get the check to us in a timely manner. BOO.  Mimi's, I'm over you!"}
{"text":"We came here for a rehearsal dinner. Right from the moment we walked in our waitress rocked!! She was very knowledgeable about the menu and what exactly each item was. Some of the stuff I never heard of. It was delicious and the waitress was awesome! If I ever go back to North Carolina I will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"Mimi's is a great place for good french style comfort foods.  We always go there with a BOGO coupon in hand which you get almost every week if you join their email club. We nearly always have the same thing.  Ignacio loves the salmon over spinach with potatoes. I like the large Turkey reuben sandwich and Uriel usually goes for a burger but this time he went for the grilled chicken sandwich we he said he would have again. Service is usually pretty spot on and we have never had a complaint about the food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while my car was getting washed next door. Had Melissa as my server and she was awesome :) the grilled cheese and tomato soup was delicious! Coming back to try their breakfast very soon."}
{"text":"It was A-OK. Really no other way to put it.  This place is right by where I get my hair done. I was early for my recent appointment and decided to grab a quick breakfast while I waited.  It was around 8:30A on a Wednesday, and the place was empty. When I entered (just behind another party), there was no hostess and we all just stood there, waiting. I decided to head to the counter and seat myself instead.  Although there was only 1 other person at the counter, the server took FOREVER to greet me, take a drink order or give me a menu. Otherwise, she was really nice.  I decided to try their berry mimosa and surprisingly, this was one of the best mimosas I've EVER had (that is saying a lot)....they give you the split of champagne and there was plenty of juice/berries and it had really good flavor (considering it was cheap champagne).  It was just before St. Paddy's Day and the corned beef bennie had my name written all over it! The corned beef itself was good, but this wasn't really a \"bennie.\" There wasn't any bread and I think that was a big mistake....if everything were on top of brioche or an english muffin, this dish would have been REALLY good. I also didn't really like the small, whole potatoes on the side.  Overall, a decent experience. I might stop in again if I am waiting before my next hair appointment!"}
{"text":"Lunch today, got French dip sandwich and French onion soup.  By far the worst of either ever. French dip sandwich was meat slapped on bread, both were tasteless. Soup? Meh... won't be back"}
{"text":"I have to say how disappointed I am with Mimi's Cafe. I've never been a huge fan of their food quality but gave it another shot. A few days ago I took my mother to lunch there. We sat in the big half circle booth by the opening to the kitchen. We ordered.... 20 mins later, no food, 10 mins after that still no food. Mind you, we only ordered the half sandwich & salad. Regardless of the wait, within the 30+ mins I looked behind me & saw a manager pick food from the salad bar with her bare hands & dip it in some dressing and eat it. She did that twice. The third time she looked up & saw that I could see her so she put it down immediately & proceeded to get a little cup then still went to use her hands! She caught herself before she did & just put it all down. Obviously I had flustered her.  Our server eventually had to go into the kitchen & frantically ask the chefs for our food. Really? You think it would be ready by now. Once we got the food, needless to say, we were hesitant to touch our salad. So I went to eat my fruit & every piece tasted of onion! Strawberries, melon, pineapple... ONION!  I normally don't like to complain about anything but a managers fingers in food & fruit not tasting of fruit... Yeah I said something lol. I told our server & she seemed shocked. Our server told us she couldn't wait to tell the manager & that she's going to be so embarrassed. Then gave us some muffins after handing us our FULL bill. Now, I don't mind paying at all!! Not looking for a freebie. But wow... Would you want to eat your salad after seeing a MANAGER sticking her fingers all over the salad bar that gets served to every customer?!? SO SO SOOOOO disappointing and GROSS!!!!! I had just had foot surgery which is why I wanted to sit at that booth to make it easier to out my leg up. All I wanted was a nice meal with my mother and to treat her since she's helped out so much with my husband and kids since my surgery. I still \"treated\" her to lunch but really was paying for a horrible experience and food we didn't even eat!!  Thanks to the server for some muffins but that doesn't quit cut it..."}
{"text":"Wide variety of good food friendly staff the wait usually isn't too long"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible . Waiter took 15 mins just to bring coffee and was not friendly at all. checked on us until we were almost leaving  too late now we said .  We would of use this place as our monthly get together . It's too bad because service is everything to me . Hope manager reads and makes changes .  Only reason I didn't give it a 1* is because my avocado beacon omelette was delicious I would give the cook 5*..."}
{"text":"The food here is good as well as the service.  I like the decor and that there is has a diner inside.  I like the breakfast egg dishes, the baked goods and the comfort food selection, like the Tillamook macaroni and cheese.  Portions are ample except the meal salads seem small.  Soup and salad and/or sandwich deal is good.  Muffins are delicious as are the crepes.  Not a true country style French restaurant but some Americanized French fare.  Don't expect Mon Ami Gabi."}
{"text":"Something is definitely right about this place. I had the white fish with capers in a great sauce, potatoes and spinach. Very satisfying. Some people had the turkey which is always delicious. The servers and manager were so anxious to please. $5 wine all the time is great! Mimis always has coupons emailed to us for extra savings. Mimis tries harder!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Mimi's and used to frequent them regularly before they started closing all the more convenient locations in the valley.    I  can certainly see why they are closing.   My latest experience wasn't the best and the waiter was completely oblivious to creating a positive customer experience.   We asked for a bread basket to start off and were told it was \"cooking\" and that he would get it to us shortly.   Upon ordering my first two picks were not available.   So I ordered the grilled chicken and frites.   Now I understand that frites are twice fried so they are crunchier and a little drier than most french fries.   it was clear that these had been sitting in the hopper for quite a while or the cook put these down on the plate significantly sooner than the chicken.   The frites arrived ice cold and stale.   The chicken was fresh and cooked well.  The waiter brought food out and completely forgot the bread basket.   When we asked again he said \"oh yeah sorry it's still cooking.\"   The waiter was clearly preoccupied with the British couple in the corner because they got great service.   They got checked up on frequently, they were offered dessert etc.   We got one refill dropoff the entire time.  No check up to see if the food was okay.   We  were simply handed a check and wished a \"blessed night.\"   On our way out we clearly saw that they had plenty of bread for the bread basket we had requested.   It's no wonder these places are closing all over.   I probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location several times and have never really had any problems....until my last visit a few months ago. Im only reviewing now because my family is looking to go somewhere for a Thanksgiving lunch and I was going to call the Summerlin location (as im turned off from this Durango location).  Reviews for both locations arent that impressive.  Food overall in my experience is decent. The past couple of times Ive ordered fries theyve been soggy. But the problem I had was the restaurant cleanliness. We came in at about 11am on a weekday. We were seated at an end booth. Our area was not clean. The floor/beneath the seats had a previous party's jello and mess...and because it was still a little earlier in the day, on a weekday, and the restaurant wasnt that busy, it made me feel like this was even sitting here from the night before. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"First time here.  My mom took me on a Monday night early.  Was not crowded.  Maybe three tables full of patrons.  Understaffed?   Lots of tables needed bussing and it took a long time just to be seated.  On a good note  our waiter was extremely polite and when things were wrong he and the manager were well versed in apologies.   PROBLEMS....mom had salmon and I had a burger,   The salmon was grilled to death,  literally beyond well done.  My burger had at least 1/8 inch of burn on one side.  A,literal hard crust.   Given the amount of other recent poor reviews it would seem well beyond time Mimi's decided thus cook isn't doing the job he or she was hired to do.  Literally destroying what used to be a good place to eat and since it wasn't crowded it seems the cook is either drunk, distracted by personal problems, or literally intent on killing business.   I blame management,   One bad day sure. It happens,  it happens again and you ah end fired or re motivated the employee then you are the problem.  I may try it one more time after a few weeks to see if management resolves the chef issues.  If not it will be a no go zone forever"}
{"text":"Aweful. The food tasted like it was microwaved which it probably was. The servers sucked they all standed around and talked while i need something for my meal. The hostess were rude. The food is not what it used to be they down graded 100%. Someone needs to shut them down before their food starts killing all the old folks that go in that place,"}
{"text":"i love ihop but i now love Mimis came here for my birthday brunch and it was so delicious!! free cake at the end of my meal the chicken pot pie was bomb!! and my friend got a vegan crepe! love it here"}
{"text":"This was my favorite breakfast place, but I'm disappointed that they took away the lemon poppyseed pancakes. They were truly spectacular! Their breakfasts just aren't the same anymore. The food is still high quality and tasty, but I can't give them five stars until those pancakes are brought back."}
{"text":"Ive only been to Mimi's for breakfast and each time has been better than the previous. From eggs and bacon to a muffin to the seasonal banana chocolate chip pancakes everything has been excellent.   My first trip had awful service as my waiter left without giving anyone my table, but since that trip service has been top notch.   I learned today, that they added free wifi and it is super fast! I'm glad I brought my computer with me!    Mimi's serves lunch and dinner I really don't care. The breakfast is great."}
{"text":"Love comfort food.  Turkey dinner was great.  It was moist and delicious.  I did have to ask for extra gravy.  My husband loved the chicken parmesan. That surprised me because usually I like Italian at Italian restaurants only.  Bread basket was fresh.  Kids meals are free.  My kids loved their grilled cheeses.  They had a great deal in wine.  The service was just ok.  I can't stand when the server leaves al the dirty finished plates just sitting there.   They need to bus the tables."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a quiet Friday night. The atmosphere was very simple and the food was delicious. The serving sizes here are also huge so might want to share some plates. I would def come back to this place next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Staff was amazing. The food was delicious. We had a really large party and they were very fast and accommodating. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before and had good experiences, but sadly this time was different.  Not only was the food barely edible, the service was worse.  I would have complained about the food if I could have found the server.  Maybe she knew it was crap and was avoiding me.  No need to avoid me now, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"While some of their dishes I'm sure are actually good they are unfortunately not ones that I can have. Their burgers are overpriced and lousy. Freddys makes a much better burger and even though they actually beat out any restaurant I've had A burger at most of those other restaurants would beat out Mimis too. To be honest after having been here several times and never being happy the only reason I was there tonight was in support of a friend and only in support of a friend will I ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I'll start with this, I was greeted and seated quickly the server was good I ordered 2 coffees one for me one for my mom along with two omelettes. The reason for the 2 stars it was not good like really bad the food that is then  the bill was dropped off and $35 was the cost now I have to tip the guy so two people having breakfast at Mimi's ran me $43 bucks just not worth it. Well there's my two cents.."}
{"text":"After a long day at work and two rambunctious children, Mimi's Café is a restaurant I can depend on for a table service dinner. Mimi's Café brings family fun to kid-friendly dining while also adding charm. Mimi's near Fort Apache Rd. and West Charleston Blvd. always brings consistency and reliability.    Tonight is a mid-week family dinner slump, but when I say let's get pancakes for dinner at Mimi's, we have smiles and cheers. Sherrie was our server tonight. She brought  joy and alacrity to our table. Our service was flawless. We were greeted with immediacy. Our requests were addressed. The speed from menu to  placement was well paced. The Chocolate Chip Puppy Dog Griddlecakes were served with fresh, red grapes and two orange halved slices. Roasted Chicken Crêpes had a delicate texture and moist chicken. The chardonnay sauce accompanied the plate in a serving boat. The salad was zesty and crisp. The Slow-Roasted Chicken with Mimi's chef prepared  rosemary herbes de Provence butter is a dependable favorite.  A thank you to hostess to chefs to Sherrie really is justifiable. Overall, we left feeling satisfied in our stomachs and our spirits. Thank you for a comfortable evening out to a spontaneous dinner."}
{"text":"Breakfast menu looked awesome but the food arrived cold and it was not very tasty. Waitress was great, but probably won't be back because of how bland the food tasted."}
{"text":"When I was visiting, my friend took me here it has many french and creole new orleans style dishes to choose from during lunch and dinner.  It is nice for a light lunch with sandwiches, pastas, seafood and salads to choose from.  I didn't try breakfast but, next time I visit Az., I would definitely stop in"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend Mimi's cafe on Thanksgiving.  Staff was not friendly, and when we showed up around 6:30 most items on menu were no longer available."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast. They are always busy Sunday morning after church. They have good food and (usually) good service. Because they were so busy, we sat at the bar. The waitress that took our order and served us was quite rude. She had a bad attitude and was even offensive when asked a question.  I wish I knew her name, I would include it, but they don't wear name tags.   Everyone else was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for a weekend brunch as we didn't feel like waiting for all of eternity at The Place (which is usually the case). As soon we walked in, we treated ourselves to a free helping of coffee cake and coffee in the waiting area. This was a certainly a welcoming surprise. Restaurant was clean and homey - like a dining room from a typical Colonial style home or cottage. Wait time was only about one minute, which is pretty damn good for a brunch place on a Sunday morning.  We ordered two entress - a croissant sandwich with egg, bacon, and tomato and a veggie omelette. The croissant was light and fluffy with a nice flaky outside. Egg in the sandwich was over-easy which is my favorite style of egg. I would have liked it a little more runny, but that's just a personal preference. Omelette was tasty and light without the heaviness that you find in most American breakfasts. Omelette also came with a side of potatoes which were pretty standard and a muffin with different flavors to choose from. We chose the pumpkin muffin and it was HUGE. The brown sugar crust on top was great and contrasted well with the moist, fluffy inside. This muffin was the best thing about the breakfast.  I wouldn't go far out of the way to come here (as is the case with most chains) but since this walkable from where I live, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This used to be a nice place to eat but the last 2 visits we were extremely disappointed and wont be back.  About a month ago we came in on a Sunday around 12 noon.  Of course they were busy but we waited nearly and hour for a table and the service lacked.  Last night we gave it another try because dinner usually is not busy like other area restaurants and we wanted to get in and out quickly to make a movie afterwards.  We ordered burgers well done.  We waited quite some time being it was extremely slow and the waiter kept apologizing.  Not his fault, but we did hear him apologizing to the next table for something not coming out correctly as well.  Then we were told they were almost done and just waiting on the fries.  The burgers came out medium (very pink inside) and the fries were soggy and greasy. I NEVER send food back.  I usually will just pick at it and make it work.  But everything was wrong and not edible.  So we asked for the manager who wasn't very \"on the ball\".  Shame really.  This place used to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"How do you screw up a hamburger? 1) Cook it medium rare when it was ordered medium well. 2) after it's been sent back only cook to medium. 3) serve it with cold soggy french fries. 4) serve it on a rock hard dry cold bun That was difficult to cut even with a butter knife. One of the people in our party had to spend an hour in the bathroom after lunch!  Lunch was just nasty"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight in a group of 11 people.  We had entree choices of turkey, salmon, pot roast, and mac and cheese.    I picked the mac and cheese which was penne in cheese sauce with real bacon bits and \"pulled chicken\", with bread crumbs on top all baked so the bread crumbs were browned really crispy like a crust.   The chicken was plentiful and tender.  I am soooo glad I picked this entree over the other three.  Everyone spoke up that they thought the food was good.  I found the pot roast really weird.  I did not recognize it because it looked like an 8 oz sirloin steak with dark brown gravy on top, and some dry broccoli sprigs on the side of the plate.  No carrots.   It was not at all a \"stew, with veggies\".    The turkey entree was very mundane-looking, slices over mashed potatoes and some gravy and the same broccoli on the side.  Most of the 11 ordered the turkey.  I think only one person had the salmon, which was a very thin piece, looked about 1/4\" thin.    I think the service was a bit lacking to ME.  Our server gave every one of the 11 ice water, but I did not get a glass.  Towards the end of the dinner, when I really needed my water, I told her that I never got any water, and showed her that the glass nearest to me belonged to the lady across from me.  The server seemed so startled and taken aback, and went to get me water right away.   Later, while we were eating, I never saw her again.   No one came to pour me more decaf.  There was a mexican woman rearranging the tables that people had vacated, even though some of the 11 people were still sitting at the other tables.  I asked her for some more decaf, but she did not acknowledge me.  So I tapped her back and asked again, turned out she heard me, but at least she could acknowledge me.   I figured she didn't speak English.    Then I asked her for a take out box, but she acted like she didn't hear me again.   I just waited, as she continued to busy herself with moving the tables from the center of the room, to the sides of the room.  Finally she went to get my take out box, meaning she did hear me.  Then I wanted a to go cup for my coffee so I could leave.  I had to wait till she moved more tables to the side.  It wasn't anything urgent, not like people were standing there waiting to sit at them.  I feel she should have gotten my to go cup as soon as I asked her, so I could leave the table so she could clean up.  The cup was only a few feet away behind a counter in the same room, not like she had to go out of our meeting area where I attended a presentation.  She acted deaf and mute, really said not a thing, and did not give any eye contact either.    I give my food maybe 4 stars, and the service 2 stars, so overall three."}
{"text":"The price is right! I'm so glad I found this cozy little place to eat. Away from the hustle and bustle. The food is saturated in flavor! I've never tasted salmon like this! Our waitress, Heather, was awesome! She paid attention to us and what we wanted. She had a great personality and even engaged in a little conversation.  This will definitely be my go to place to eat when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"For a chain it's not bad but avoid it like the plague on Sunday morning unless you love a massive crowd and tons of crying babies. If you like to eat a big breakfast though this place is pretty generous."}
{"text":"Well when you read these you either read something good or bad... This reviews is bad. 6 months ago the service was so bad I told myself I'd never go back. I decided to give them another shot while I was entertaining friends from out of town we had a group of 10 people. Our server started out ok but it seemed like she got overwhelmed and started making mistakes like forgetting to refill coffee and bringing us food we didn't order. When our food came everything was good except for one plate the eggs Benedict the eggs were over cooked so I sent it back. Server said ok and took it back and said sorry.  That was the last time we saw our server for the rest of our meal.  The manager came by and dropped off the new plate and walked away.  I took a bite of cold English muffin raw meat with a poached egg on top. The potatoes were not cooked and this is what set me off.  I tried to find the server she wasn't around so I asked the hostess to send a manager to our table. He gave me a cheeky smile and said what's wrong with your food since he was the one who gave me the food he should have seen what was wrong.  They took a portion of our bill off but this was a bad second experience with the same problem. I left without eating.  I will not be going to that brand again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. It was our 1st time at this location. We normally frequent another location that's closer to home.  Tonight we came with a party of 6 (3 adults and 3 children). We only waited a few minutes to be seated. It was surprising to discover that the restaurant wasn't busy on a Saturday night.  I don't remember our server's name, but she was great from start to finish!  She was prompt with bringing our drinks, bread basket, & taking our order. We ordered a bowl of corn chowder, the bouillabaisse special, turkey dinner with a side salad, & 2 kids meals.  I don't know what it is about the carrot bread in the bread basket, but it's so good! Everyone wishes we just got a basket full of it.  Most of the food was awesome, except for one of the kids meals. Let's start with the good.. It's nice to see that the Mac and cheese wasn't Kraft. It was freshly made in house. The downside kids Mel was the corn dogs. My 9 year old sister only at 2 (their minis). She said it tasted funny..  Aside from that, it was a great evening at Mimi's."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, came on a Monday and there was no lunch rush so I was seated right away. Ordered the roasted chicken crepes and an iced tea. My drink came right away and the lunch entree came with minimum wait. Portion wise was just right, salad was fresh and not overly covering the the plate with 2 crepes of decent size. The server was polite and friendly also offered to pour my dressing for my entree besides doing the ground pepper thing. This is something you would expect in a upper tier restaurant. She also kept an eye on my iced tea and refilled it without me asking. Top notch service for a medium price restaurant. Overall experience was great. Had the cheese cake for dessert and that was awesome. Definitely something to recommend to anyone. Upon leaving she invited me to try their breakfast sometime instead of the usual have a nice day I get. Now that throws you in a happy loop. A place that cares about you coming back."}
{"text":"This place I will try again in order for some redemption of their status.  The first two times, the waitress was un-attentive, but I'm willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant! We went twice in the past week! Not very busy but not slow. Took advantage of a free entre' coupon and $5 house wines. What a great dinner!!! Deviled eggs---try them!   Brunch--Mimosas, any will do! Very good!  Chicken and waffles are on Point! Just be ready to eat a lot of food!   I feel that they are Northlakes little secret, try them out! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent food at decent prices. French onion soup is very good, as are their Cobb salad, muffins and quiches. The half-roasted chicken with frites was just okay - pretty bland and the fries were too mushy. Service is hit or miss, depending on when you go and who your server is. They're always polite but can be sloooow."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the restaurant with friends until my food showed up.  I ordered the chicken and fries.  I received a lot of fries that were under friedand this little piece of chicken.  It was $12.99 for fries and 4 bites of chicken.  Everyone else's meal was worth the price.  The menu has totally changed.  new look,  less choices and higher prices."}
{"text":"Like an upscale Denny's with a French theme to it. I got a Florentine Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was a bit off, thick and tasted like lemon and potato. The French toast was not crisp, the texture was like a wet sponge. Coffee was ok a little better than gas station coffee. Prices should be lower for quality. All in all would not go again. I can see why so many old people go here. No offense but your tastebuds do start to go when u get to a certain age."}
{"text":"I am only giving them 3 stars because the service I received on Sat. was great our server was a pregnant girl (I don't remember her name) but she was very nice and accepted our coupons. The coupon clearly states that is one per check not one for the whole table and even our server from Sat. didn't make a big deal and was ok when we asked for 2 checks and gave her 2 coupons.  Anywayz.... I went 2 days ago during dinner and told the server we wanted 3 separate checks in the table and I showed him the coupons it was a $5 off the classic menu and 2 for the buy one dinner and get another free. It was 5 of us and so the waiter a bald guy (not sure of his name) said it was one for table and so we told him ok so would you validate it if some of us would sit in the table infront of us? after that he gave me such a long and useless explanation of how corporate and management had their rules and this was coming from them, bla, bla, bla!!! He asked if I wanted to speak with his manager but I didn't because I did not want to cause a scene so my sister asked me to leave it alone.   When it was time to pay we only used 2 coupons for separate checks and the waiter gave me another long explanation about my coupon and how he was going to talk to his manager and I said \"but I got my meal from the classic menu.\"   When he returned he said that they were going to accept it this time and he continues saying \"Im sure that it will be accepted next time too\" 0_o ok???? What was the big deal?  Lastly, when he brought us back our receipts my sisters had a free dinner or breakfast entry but mine didn't. It was obvious why he did that but its ok because I get more coupons in the mail room ; )  I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE DURING THE WEEK FOR DINNER ONLY BREAKFAST DURING THE WEEKEND ; )"}
{"text":"Five Alarm Sante Fe Omelette - you have a special place in my heart.  I get mine extra spicy, as if the diced jalepenos and spicy chipotle sauce weren't enough.  Shredded tortilla is a nice touch as well.  Muffins are usually quite good, as are the crepes and huevos y papas (potato cakes with salas, green chile, eggs, and tomatillo sauce).  Orange juice is good, and hard to find good OJ these days.  Service is average.    I go here on weekdays to avoid the damn weekend people who crowd up my regular restaurants.  You know who you are."}
{"text":"OK, been wanting to try this place but the reviews were really not that great.  But last night my wife and myself were in the area and thought we'd give it a try.  And what a very pleasant surprise it turned out to be. First of all, loved the way the place is laid out and the decor.  The menu, gawd was it great to go in a restaurant in Charlotte that's menu wasn't tex-mex, Chinese, Italian or the never ending bar food .  I had the Asparagus and brie quiche, my wife had the turkey and dressing. Mine also came with a bowl of French Onion soup.  Soup was excellent as was the quiche.   Mine also came with some nice fruit and a excellent mixed green salad.  Everything was excellent. Only possible complaint, they brought my soup after the main course.  But still a great change of pace from the usual microwave food served in most Charlotte restaurants.  Oh, waitress warned us not to come on a Sunday morning, long lines and a long wait.  But we're certainly going back there, I have to place it on my ten best restaurants in Charlotte list.  Wow,  its amazing how inconsistant the reviews are.Looks like it pretty much depends on whos working when you get there.  This is something the management needs to address."}
{"text":"Never been here despite all the people I've heard that raved about it, especially during my LA days.  So, on my last day as an AZ resident a friend recommended we meet there for lunch, which I looked forward to with excitement.  For a Tuesday, it was hella crowded with old peeps.  I thought I'd left Sun City behind but apparently the ones that have alternate forms of transportation (e.g., a real car vs the golf cart) all descended on Mimi's the day I went.  I agree with Kimberly S on decor--super tacky.  It was like a french cafe and american diner mated & the offspring resulted in a Dennys frame with a French Quarter and generic diner inspired outfit.    They brought out a small basket of assorted sweet breads before our meal--pumpkin bread, sourdough roll & something resembling a dark but sweet bread with raisins.  I ordered the split pea soup with ham bits--standard fare that was thick but tasty.    We decided to share dessert & ordered the classic ensemble.  Included in this sampler were an apple crisp served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a bread pudding doused with too much melted butter, and a brownie with with another scoop of ice cream & chocolate syrup.  Definitely more sugar than one should consume in a month, even if you don't consume the small portions in their entirety.    The crowd of demanding, cranky faced old people, slow waitress, and average food has inspired me to stay away.  Unless I'm hungry & someone offers me a free meal.  And no other places are open within a 100 mile radius."}
{"text":"The manager, a female older, larger woman kicked my kids out of the waiting area where they had grabbed an open table and began eating their In-N'-Out but, apparently this once proud family owned restaurant has gone completely corporate and can't handle the marketing & branding confusion from the bags of food they were eating.   Very rude! Completely lost my appetite.   Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"The last time I was here I had the Quiche Lorraine and it was delicious. It came with a low-fat blueberry muffin (didn't taste so well but that's what I get for ordering low-fat) and some fresh fruit. I like the overall atmosphere here, it feels like a family place and in a way I feel homey here. Also the artwork is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The service was just fine. Waitress was nice and attentive. Hostess was nice but a bit quiet for a front of house representative. The Mardi Gras Omlette had much less to desire. I was unable to taste much let alone the andouille sausage was not easily found. Not sure where it was hiding but it won the hide and seek challenge this morning. Wife got the Stuffed French Toast was flavorful but so soggy it was less toast more bread pudding. The presentation was absolutely missing. The line cooks apparently slapped it all on the plate. There was no wait and not terribly busy to justify the I'll presentation. I was not looking to be overwhelmed with amazing but not more than a house that serves waffles worth of quality. A bit sad since the building itself is very nice and has a great feeling you'll have a nice meal....and then...."}
{"text":"This place is bad. So bad. I ordered a turkey club sandwich and not only did my waitress take forever to get to my table but the food tasted very dry like it was sitting out. The fries I got were also so cold and disgusting. Our waiter was nice but It took her forever to come and ask what we wanted to order and pick up our check. This place in general has horrible food and service."}
{"text":"Decent place for a Sunday breakfast. Low end diner decor with good food and decent coffee. Mixed feelings about the waitresses but their muffins are good. Sometimes the food comes quickly and other times you have to wait. Seems to be a popular place, with a good mix of clientele."}
{"text":"Had breakfast and it was good. Had eggs Benedict and was ok. Hollandaise sauce was cold but other than that very food. Had a kids pancake that looked like a dog and she loved it. The breakfast tacos were very very dry but she said we're tasty. Orange juice was warm, should of been ice cold in my opinion. Staff and service was good with no complaints. Won't make it our favorite breakfast place but I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Not really sure what happened to this place. It used to be so good. The last 3-4 times my family has been here it is getting progressively worse. The service is going down hill and the food is seriously lacking the flavor it used to have. The wait times are ridiculous when the restaurant is only 25% capacity. Many tables have not been bussed 30min after people left. The bathrooms are just disgusting. They even left the special of the day sign out front when they ran out of the item, which was very frustrating and delayed our order even further. Regretfully we will not continue to eat here as there are no signs of this establishment getting any better. They have lost a loyal and regular family that enjoyed eating at this location."}
{"text":"I'd give Mimi's 5-stars if their managers didn't always seems so aggravated and frazzled on Sundays. I get it, it's busy and you have a long line of people to seat. But you can at least put on your friendly face, smile in the face of adversity and BE NICE to your employees! On Sunday, April 8 around 12:30, me and my daughter walked in and waited for our seat. In the meantime, we both observed a tall, older, male manager working the front losing his cool for whatever reason. He snapped at his employees when they approached him for what I don't know. He had the grace of Godzilla. He feigned a really awkward friendliness (aka phony) when I approached him to give a party of 2 notice. He was so uptight, unhappy and clearly unpleased. A few folks around us who were also waiting commented on his demeanor. Phew! Glad it wasn't just me. Moving on....the food here is always phenomenal! Also, the service is always on point! Glad the employees here don't mimic their stressed out manager. They are courteous, friendly, attentive, and always professional...even while swamped.  MANAGER- learn from your employees. Things will get worse before they get better. No need to lose your cool over a busy day's work. And yes, I've worked in the food industry. I get it. Regardless, always put on your happy face and just do it. But do it right. People observe, talk... and they know. ;)"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with friends. It's a very cool looking place, with a French theme. Great in that case. Then we got our drinks to start. All the cups were dirty and stained. My cup had left over crust from a past customer's plate. We asked for new cups. The waitress brought them, and the replacement drink cups were dirty too! Terrible. I don't want to drink the left over bits from other customers. Besides that, the food was pretty good, that is, the meatloaf. But the mashed potatoes had a funny taste. The service was not that good. The waitress disappeared for 30 minutes. My water cup was empty for the rest of the experience. In fact, she didn't refill anything at all during the entire time. She was gone into the end until we had to flag down a cook or busboy to get our checks. And this was during a slow hour too.  No excuses. I will not return again. I was embarrassed as an American because one of my best friends was from a different country. Glad they enjoyed the food, but the dirtiness was a turn off. If you don't care if your food and drinks are served in dirty dishes and cups, go there to try their food. But if you don't want to turn off your hot date with gross greasy cups, avoid."}
{"text":"This french~wannabe restaurant is OK. Went for two days in a row. One for lunch, the other for breakfast.  had the french dip sandwich and Monterey omelette. Food was simple, nothing spectacular. Not bad either. I would put it in the same category of an Ihop.  Service was very friendly, thou.  The butter muffin was very good."}
{"text":"We just moved from Texas and didn't know of any places to eat so we have Mimi's a try.  We love the the variety,  esp the muffins.  Its a great place to take the kids and enjoy Mimosa."}
{"text":"Very tasty reataurant with geeat food and great service.    Ive bewn hwre several times and its always great."}
{"text":"Ugh!! I should have known from the parking lot this was gonna be bad. The server was fast and attentive, he went above and beyond and brought me a lunch menu during the breakfast service to help me find something that appealed to my appetite, it's the little things that make a patron happy.. The reason for such a lack luster review would be the filth (success is in the details) as a new mom to a moving toddler I've found more reason to appreciate and inspect the cleanliness of places. There was dust caked on the back of the booth (which inevitably would have my babys mouth on it shortly), not pleased to be wiping down the seats and walls prior to relaxing for a nice meal.."}
{"text":"2 stars for the decor and $5 happy hour on all wines. Other than that service was terrible and food was mediocre. We arrived around 5:00 and seated quickly. However it seemed there was only one waiter for the entire dining room. We sat for well over 10 minutes before he came over. No drinks and no bread.   Once he did come to our table we ordered drinks and dinner. All glasses of wine are $5 for happy hour which is nice. We decided on the pot roast with soup and a house salad. It was quite a while before we finally got our drinks, and still no bread. The salad came out and finally bread. Did not care for the raisin bread, too sweet for dinner.   The pot roast came out a while later after we had finished the salad and soup. The plates were never removed. They sat on the table the entire meal, up to the bill.  The pot roast was chewy and the broccoli overcooked. I swear the mashed potatoes were instant. After we were done the waiter offered us dessert. We chose the apple crisp after offering us about 5 choices. He returned and said all they had tonight was a brownie, they were out of everything else.   In the waiters defense it seemed like he had a lot of tables and had no help. The manager finally came out to assist him but by then it was too late. Service was a ZERO. I like the \"french country house\" decor but food and service are severely lacking. And sold out of 4 of the 5 desserts we were offered?? Disappointing experience to say the least."}
{"text":"The food was bad !! Meatloaf did not taste fresh. Chicken pot pie was not good . This places has  gone down . We use to here all the time now maybe once every 1 and after tonight next year won't happened"}
{"text":"I love Mimi's cafe! I look forward to breakfast here every time I visit Vegas. My favorite is the ham and swiss crepes.  But everything I've ordered on the menu is just as good and full of flavor.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but not over bearing.  Whether you live near-by or are just visiting, I highly recommend the drive to Mimi's.  Wish there was one in my neighborhood!  Oh and get a croissant."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waitress didn't check on us for 30 minutes. We didn't have drinks or bread. The place was so dead but still didn't have decent service. Food was just ok. Nothing impressive. Will never eat here again"}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Mimi's, so I popped in on the way to somewhere else.  It's pretty chain-y; doesn't look like much from the road, but there's a big parking lot, and inside, dark red accents and \"French\" posters.  It's popular with the after-church crowd on Sundays.  I had some kind of omelet.  I don't see any reason to go there again.  My first impression is Bob Evans:\"farm\"::Mimi's:\"French\" (except Mimi's has a smaller menu)."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mimi's since I discovered them in '06 and my visits have now become very few and far between.  Long time customers could probably agree that the customer service in most places is like a casino game, you get lucky every once in a while but most of the time it's a shot in the dark. Also the prices have gone up while the quality and quantity goes down. And for someone like me who had a \"usual\" it was very surprising to see the kinds of changes being made over the years.   Also...don't go past 7pm, you'll get left with the slim pickings. I had a Ceasar salad so soggy and the croutons were not fresh, you could squish them with the fork. Thankfully when we showed the manager she didn't charge me for it. The evening staff is also a younger, not very experienced group. We were sitting in the booths next to the kitchen and we could here them joking and cussing with eachother. They also left some guy waiting with a to go order over 5min just to fetch change they clearly forgot. So there was more than one person who left disappointed.  I used to really like this place, but I definitely think tonight Is the last time my family and I will be returning. Sad and done giving this place second and third chances..."}
{"text":"Shoni hipped me 2 this joint...The breakfast is off the hook here...No joke!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty. A regular spot for us however tonight we noticed it was very dirty. Our booth was nasty as well as the wall and window. Food was good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!"}
{"text":"Never been to a Mimi's Cafe before, but my wife and I decided to go tonight. We got off to a very slow start at this location. It took a little long to be greeted at the door. We were first seated at a booth that was too cramped, then reseated in the sparsely inhabited dining room at a half booth/half table. The chairs were a tight squeeze and appeared to be the only ones in the restaurant with arms. I moved over to the booth side to sit next to my wife and was comfortable from then on.  Good thing, since no one seemed to be in the mood to be our server. Apparently, as was explained later, the person running the front changed around who was serving what table and didn't bother to tell the servers.  Once we finally got a server, things went much better. We got our drinks, appetizer, and soups quickly.  The soup, clam chowder (Friday's soup du jour) was rich, thick, and flavorful. Our appetizer, spinach and artichoke dip, fit that description as well.  Our entrees were also quite good. My wife had the tilapia which was cooked quite well and was moist and tender. The vegetables tasted fresh and not overcooked. The mashed potatoes were quite good as was my chicken cordon bleu, though the chicken was a little overdone. Moist and tender on the inside, but too crunchy on the outside.  After the apology over the serving mix up and the long wait, the night went smoothly. Our server, Tom, was personable and we enjoyed watching him interact with another customer's child.  We'll be back at some point to try other things on the interesting menu. Might even save room for a dessert."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my friend and daughter on Saturday.  Our waitress, while sweet, seemed overwhelmed.  It took her a few more minutes to bring us our drinks, and take our orders than I would have expected, but I could tell she was working as fast as she could and probably had too many tables.    The food was okay, although my chopped Cobb Salad wasn't presented quite as smartly as it appears in the photo on the menu, it was in more of a jumble than a perfectly lined up presentation.  My French onion soup had a delicious flavor, although the Swiss cheese covered French bread on top was chewy and very hard to eat because I couldn't cut it into pieces.  Finally, my bran muffin was among the best I've ever had, and I know from bran muffins.  I did notice that the table next to us was unbussed and remained that way the whole time we were there; that mess was slightly distracting.  Another slightly unpleasant thing was that our table was positioned right next to a side exit to the restaurant and when people opened the side door to leave we got an Arctic blast of air right in our faces. (I guess that wouldn't be an issue 99% of the time here in the Valley, but this weekend it was certainly cold enough for it to be uncomfortable to sit at that table.)   The damage for lunch for three girls was $52, plus adding a 20% tip and it made for a slightly higher priced lunch that I would have preferred, but for an occasional special lunch I guess it's okay.  I will say though, that $2.59 for each soda and iced tea is just too friggen high.  Honestly, it should be about $1.99 per fountain drink, maximum."}
{"text":"I see the negative reviews but this chain is one I first went to in California and I love it. It is unique for a chain to have a similar friendly staff whichever location you go to but Mimi's does. It is reasonably priced comfort food is how I would describe it. When I was pregnant I couldn't get enough of the tomato basil soup. Great desserts too."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. Not bad, its a solid 3 star. Service was decent. They put the calories on the menu which is nice but 1900 calories for griddle pancakes  wow.. they should have some healthier options , but, i would go again."}
{"text":"I received a buy one entree, get one free coupon for joining their fan club membership so my son and I went this morning for breakfast. Got there around 9am. Greeted and seated immediately in a nice booth. Waitress was quite knowledgeable and took our order after giving us time to peruse the menu. I ordered the Country fried steak and eggs which comes with OJ, country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg. We both agreed that the breakfast was OK, both our potato sides were cold. I had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak, which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy. Put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldn't pour so I used a spoon. I spread it on my Country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast. Weird! Watch out for the coffee. If you are offered flavored coffee it is extra. Hidden charges for everything. In other words, even with the coupon the total came to almost $20.00. for 2 average breakfasts. (tip, cancer donation, etc.) I had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. I should have known better! Probably not coming back. My son seconds the motion."}
{"text":"So I stop at Mimi on my way through Charlotte- ONLY based on the Yelp Reviews of awesome breakfast. Afterall, it was my birthday. So I go in, they have these blueberry french toast covered in a gross sweet cream cheese spread. The French Toast was bland and tasteless, and the eggs tasted like HS cafteria boxed eggs- dry and chunky with no real yolk. Just a neon yellow looking color. I got the Cajun chicken sausage and that was fatty, greasy, and tasted like Polish sausage (the big pink ones). It also didn't taste like chicken, and tasted like smoked pork. It too was gross. The grits were a good consistency (they only have grits until 11am) and thick but also bland and flavorless. I needed loads of butter salt and black pepper for it to be half decent. The best thing that I ate were the grits. Oh- the muffins are GROSS. I got the blueberry. It was dry, and taste like -- I don't even have a way to describe it. I took a bite and gave it to my cousin who passed his off to my BF. He got the Monterrey Omelette and too complained about how his food tasted. We sent back the gross French toast bc no one could eat it. We half ate the muffins. I ate the box eggs and my remade grits and had to peel the sausage from that plastic covering thing they put on pork sausage links. Just gross. The best thing was the srawberry lemonade. I will never return to MiMi for breakfast. I WOULD try lunch/dinner but if it's the same cooks as breakfast, I'll pass. I'll never go back actually. Yuck."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Mimi's. Ok it is a very nice atmosphere, pretty decor.They are going for a french bistro type of feel. I have eaten at most of them in the valley and the story is always the same. The food is good.( carrot raisin muffins- yum) and the menu innovative with their; Smart Meals, Fit and Fresh, and Small Plate options and desserts. However to be honest I don't think I will eat here anymore. I eat out for the service. Let's face it I could cook a great meal at home but I want to be waited on when I go out.I  have never had great service here.  I have had fair service, bad service, and hilatiously bad service here but never good or great  service. (And I have eaten here a lot)  It is a shame. The servers are nice enough and never rude. I  honestly just think they are to to busy here to give great service. Fellow server here thinks they should be assigned less tables. Are you listening owner/managers? The place is always packed on the weekends and i also feel the place is way to expensive.( Especially for breakfast)"}
{"text":"I bit on a buy one get one free entree with the purchase of two drinks.  Am I eating crow for saying I would never eat dinner here again?  Yes.  In my defense, I was not feeling in the mood to cook and I had a hungry child in tow.  The menu has changed for the better, meaning every entree has either a $2 or $3 add on of your choice of soup or salad or both.  I added the $2 house salad to my entree.  It was not worth it.  It was less than a fistful of greens with a couple croutons, some diced tomato (maybe ten dices) and three small cucumber slices.  If you're a soup fan, I'd recommend choosing the soup instead.  I ordered the pot roast and it was a good portion size, but it was covered in salty brown gravy of which I was not fond.  I was also surprised that the accompanying vegetables were not the typical pot roast vegetables.  Instead, I got a few slices of zucchini and some steamed broccoli.  It got me thinking that maybe Mimi's uses pre-made, portioned entrees.  This is something to investigate.  We saw the manager three times in the dining room and she stopped by twice to see how things were.  That was nice.  The waitress was better about visiting our table when we were first seated, but service degraded from there.  At one point, I was waiting 15 minutes with an empty glass before I saw her at all.  Then it took another 5 minutes for my refill.  When you have salty dishes, you need refills!  Another update?  You have to ask for the bread basket now.  In all honesty, the bread basket is the only reason we chose Mimi's over other nearby restaurants.  Our daughter sure does love that bread!  Unfortunately, the bread is definitely pre-made and frozen.  How do I know?  Because the center of the dinner roll was still ice cold!  I wish I could give Mimi's an extra half star because at least the food tasted pretty good this time around.  Still, the mediocre service and cold bread would leave this review at 3 stars anyway.  P.S. The dining room is VERY COLD.  Bring jackets or sweaters for your kids (or yourself, if you're bothered)."}
{"text":"Just another Mimi's. It is a chain. The attempt to set themselves off with opening doors and greeting people is a bit saccharin it execution, although it is a good idea. The appetizers and salad were corporate creations with little panache.  The service was between slow and moderate, on what appeared to be a small crowd. I will be moving on. Goodyear / Phoenix is such a large area and there are so many choices. Sorry Mimi's"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a delicious Cobb salad but instead found a piece of plastic from a bag or ?. My husband and grand daughter's meal were ok to deserve the 3 stars. We've always had decent meals in the past. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, I ordered Cesar Grilled Chicken Salad and the server came with a plate that I was not able to see the chicken, I after digging under the cheese and founded 4 pcs of chicken, well I looked at the server and asked her are you kidding me and I was told the regular portion is 4 ounces and if I wanted more chicken that will be have to pay extra for the chicken that should be there to begin.  Well I'm not afraid to speak my mind so I told her to take back I don't want this, if wanted a Cesar salad without chicken I'll had order that. The manager on duty come backs few minutes later while my wife was eating her Tilapia dish with another Cesar Salad but now they were 7 pcs of chicken chopped in small squares still was no more than 4 ounces and again I told her take back.  Well my wife was so hungry from waiting that she did not mind eating the Tilapia dinner that was served for  small child portion. At this location serving are small but their price is very deep. The server are the worst ever, you have to remain them to refill your drinks. Don't expect any good customer service at this location, I believe they don't know how. Manager at this location gets an (F) from me, after waiting for over 30 minutes to get serve and all she can say to me if you want to see the chicken you have to order extra meat at an extra cost. I been to this location once before and the previous time was not as bad as last night. Dinner for 2 average prices is with non-alcoholic drinks is about $50.00. Mimi's Cafe where is the chicken? Are customer are so Idiots that you get away with serving them this way? Well after my wife finish her dinner at your place, we were still hungry so we went to I Hop Restaurant down the street and got so overwhelm with the chunk of chicken on the chicken Cesar Salad. Mimi's can you guess what?  We pay a lot less and got excellent service?"}
{"text":"First time I've ever eaten here. Absolutely fell in love with this place. It's so quaint and cozy. We had mimosas and omelets made to order. The Blueberry Muffin is a must try. Great food, great service, awesome atmosphere"}
{"text":"yea i know mimi's is a chain, so don't give me shit about it. i don't really care.  the grilled cheese sandwich here is straight bombin like iraq in 2002  other favs are the turkey dinner, because why do people have to wait till November to have a good turkey dinner? you shouldn't so check it out. also on the list of things to try before you die...the pain purdue. its sick. sick sick. or at least thats how you will feel after you finish it. it's soooo sweet your teeth will beg you to see a dentist, stat. it's basicly french toast stuffed with sweetness. its badass.  the atmoshere at mimi's is totally chain, i've been to a few different locations and each one is exactly the same as the others. same wall decorations, which is like french quarter jazzy junk.   oh yea..they have mimosa's...yea i like mimosas in the morning..i admit it. how can you not like champaign in the morning? who doesnt like to get drunk in the morning????"}
{"text":"Service was great but the Meatloaf looked like a piece of burned toast! Tasted old..  it was super dry and not even the gravy helped! For what I paid, Golden Corral has better meatloaf and way better portions! I for sure will not be going back!!"}
{"text":"First time in. Food was amazing.  Portions were large. Atmosphere was nice. Had an enjoyable lunch and didn't feel rushed. Everyone was personable. The turkey and dressing tasted homemade and the gravy was light and flavorful. Mashed potatoes were creamy and hot."}
