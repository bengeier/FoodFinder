{"text":"I have really been wanting to try this place and we finally got the opportunity. Loved the waffles and all the toppings, but every flavor of yogurt tastes fake and left a horrible film and after taste in my mouth. I'm super bummed and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"On my first visit, I decided on a warm waffle, topped with salted caramel soft serve yogurt and a major drizzle of Ghirardelli milk chocolate sauce. A combo made in heaven! My second visit will be VERY soon and frequently thereafter. Five 'yums' up!"}
{"text":"Such a cute and fun idea and setting but the fro to flavors were minimum and not my fav. It is definitely worth a try bc the concept is so fun and creative!"}
{"text":"It is 6 pm on Sunday December 18th. I just drove a half hour to treat my girlfriend to dessert, and I am incredibly disappointed to see you are closed two hours before your listed closing time. It is listed on both the door and an additional sheet of paper posted to the door. There is nothing more disappointing than a place of business shutting down for the day due to their apathy towards possible customers. Can't believe I wasted an hour trying to give your business a try."}
{"text":"These waffles come straight from  heaven! Add nutella and sliced bananas and you'll never want another dessert."}
{"text":"On a hunt for Gilbert's hidden treasures I ran into this awesome place!  I brought my roommate along with me & we cannot stop talking about how good it was! The staff is great, the waffles amazing, and the frozen yogurt very memorable!!! I got a waffle with biscoff (amazing cookie butter) & strawberry/tart frozen yogurt. My roommate is hooked on triple chocolate and we have plans to go back often!"}
{"text":"This frozen yogurt place is just what we needed in our neighborhood.  This place is awesome. Very clean and friendly. .42 per ounce is reasonable.  Lots of large booths to sit in for the whole family. Tart greek yogurt and salted carmel are my new favorites.  We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Very clean;  nice atmosphere for the kiddos. Yogurt was good, plenty of topping options. However, the waffle was disgusting. It was served cool and the flavor was terribly off. If you are called \"yo waffle,\" the waffles should be on point. I may give it another shot.... to be determined."}
{"text":"Love this place!! So yummy! So much better than waffle trucks because here you can make it exactly how you want it! The employees are always friendly. 4 stars only because it seems a bit expensive... i can never seem to get out of here with less than a $9 waffle... less if you buy the groupon, but still!"}
{"text":"Wow! Better than the waffle trucks, add over 14 flavors of yogurt to choose from and you can't lose!  Nice clean atmosphere, friendly staff, will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Such a fun and different concept for dessert. Loved the waffle idea - and so yummy! I fear my waistline will not like this new place as much as my tummy does. Waffles are warm and yummy. Yes, they are under a warming light but you can request a fresh one by asking the cashiers. Warm, buttery, sweet and simply delicious. Family friendly, clean and modern layout. Will be back . . . Frequently. Get the loyalty card for frequency rewards."}
{"text":"It was an ok visit. My husband and I were having a date night and decided to end it with a waffle delight! We had never been to YoWaffle and thought it would be a fun place to try! Well, we got there around 9:30 on a Friday night. Apparently there was a big rush of people because they only had 1 waffle left! We each wanted our own. The guy working \"offered\" but then followed up with \"it would be 15 minutes\". Are they making it in an oven instead of a waffle iron? In addition to being out of the waffles they were out of fresh strawberries and a couple other toppings... eh. I understand big groups wiping you out, but it was still a bit disappointed.  We decided to share the waffle instead. We topped it with the biscotti (?) butter, Tahitian Vanilla Yogurt and blueberries. It was good."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood and I have been going here since they opened. Tonight was unacceptable, unenjoyable and I have no plans to go back again.   I arrived there tonight around 8:45pm. The place was filled with teenage kids. They were loitering around the yogurt dispensers with sample cups not making room for us knowing what flavors we wanted. They were loud, obnoxious and kept bumping and pushing into us while we were trying to fill our bowls. I almost walked out right then.   We took our yogurt outside and were sitting there watching the circus inside. It was then we realized the kids were standing around the yogurt dispensers refilling the same sample cup over and over and over again. Never getting a new sample cup. I counted 15 kids doing this. As some kids left others arrived doing the same thing.   I watched 3 groups of what I assume would have been paying customers leave before making a purchase because of this circus.   We ended up throwing what yogurt we did buy away and leaving. I was disgusted that I ate what I did seeing the kids refilling the same sample cup after they had already eaten out of them."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Young girl and guy welcomed us and asked if we had been here before or would like samples. They were helpful and so kind.   I was a little disappointed when I learned it was just frozen yogurt, since I'm not a fan of fro yo but theirs was very good and didn't have that overly sweet aftertaste of most fro yos. The vanilla flavor was amazing even with vanilla bean specs!   We didn't have the waffle but they smelled yummy!"}
{"text":"I love waffles and yo, my wife loves the idea. The owner's Mom is super near and has an AWESOME restaurant too!  No more chasing waffle trucks."}
{"text":"First, The staff were really patient with me as I tried to decide what I wanted to eat on my first visit. I was that annoying customer who went 30 minutes before closing (sorry!). The concept of this place is really cool. You first go and order what you want (waffle/waffle bowl/other things) and then you self-serve frozen yogurt and/or other toppings and syrups. Then, you go the the counter and pay for it by the total ounces after the base charge of the waffle. The froyo and toppings concept is similar to Yogurtland or MoJo yogurt so it was easy to follow.  I decided on the belgian waffle with french vanilla frozen yogurt on top and honey drizzle. It was quite delicious as the waffle was thick yet fluffy and the froyo complemented it perfectly. It's right by my neighborhood so I sense more visits in the future.   PS: The belgian waffle froyo is yumm by itself but adding it to the waffle would have been overkill. Be sure to sample it if you go!"}
{"text":"What's better than waffles with toppings? Waffles with toppings AND fro yo! I loved the concept of Yo Waffle so my boyfriend & I headed out to Gilbert for dessert. You can basically make a custom waffle and/or fro yo treat with the plethora of flavors & toppings they offer. They have unique selections such as Tigers Blood sorbet along with classics like cake batter.  My delicious creation was a waffle topped with biscoff spread, chocolate & cake batter fro yo, and nutella drizzle. While the waffles here are not the best I've ever had, I really like how everything tastes together.  Minus one star because the service was really disappointing. The couple of people who were working completely ignored me & my boyfriend when we walked in! Despite seeing us standing at the counter (which we had gone up to for ordering waffles), they didn't even say hello & went to the back room. I had to literally ring the bell to get their attention.  It's a bit of a drive to go to Yo Waffle but I'd definitely check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service tonight! Delicious yogurt. It was our first visit, and we will return. The ladies working tonight were incredibly helpful. My toddler loved it."}
{"text":"The variety of frozen yogurt flavors and toppings is awesome. The yogurt is smooth and creamy...and tasty! I've tried a lot of their flavors and I've eaten at a lot of froyo shops. Theirs is super good stuff!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night to get desert after dinner. Once we walked in the two kids working instantly greeted us and asked if we've ever visited. After telling them it was our first visit they gave us the run down and let us know we can try any flavors we want. I got a waffle with mint yogurt on top, whip cream, Nutella, and mint Oreos. The waffle was fresh and their topping selection is awesome. The total for 3 people came to just under $10. It does charge using a weight system like other self serve yogurt and adding a waffle is an additional dollar. Overall cool place with yummy options."}
{"text":"Waffles AND frozen yogurt.....how could it be anything but amazing!!! There's 14 different flavors of frozen yogurt available (I am sure some flavors change daily) such as Island Coconut, Sea Salt Carmel, Tiger's Blood, Watermelon as well as tradition Vanilla, Strawberry and Chocolate.  A wide variety of toppings including fresh fruits, sprinkles, whipped cream, cookie dough, gummy worms,  Nutella, chocolate syrup and so much more! You can get your yogurt in a cup or do it the Yo Waffle way....on a waffle. Let me tell you the waffles are one of a kind delicious!! They also can make waffles allergen free; i didn't try it but it was an option. The combination of the frozen yogurt and the waffle is so unique but utterly addicting. Cute and very clean location! Super friendly staff! This is a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Finally! No more hunting down a waffle trucks.  Here you get to make them the way you want, and have some frozen yogurt too!  Great place for the whole family."}
{"text":"Never had a waffle quite like this, super delicious! Dough based waffle with sugary yummy crystals throughout and a toppings bar at my disposal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yo Yo Yo I'm making waffles!  Alright perhaps I'm not making waffles but Yo Waffle is and they're making them and frozen yogurt for a flavor combination that is the Bomb.com!  Waffles and frozen yogurt is the best combination since chicken and waffles! Hot fresh waffles topped with your choice of frozen yogurt and multitudes of tasty toppings from gummy worms, fresh fruit, blueberry yogurt covered pretzels to four kinds of boba! Oh and don't forget the whip cream! The waffles are made fresh and served warm, wonderfully made to contain the yogurt as it melts into a mouthful of sweet gooey goodness! I tried the gluten free and to my delight it didn't taste like flavorless cardboard as I feared. It was just the right amount of sweet and a perfectly fluffy joy to eat! They have plenty of froyo to choose from, the Belgian cookie and coconut are my favorites!  Friendly service and reasonably priced, get  some sample cups and try them all! If you can't decide what to get, they have menus posted with signature waffle and frozen yogurt combinations, like the Gold Digger and Holy Matrimony!  Have them Yo way, for dessert, dinner, or any time of day, waffles they're not just for breakfast anymore!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of places that sell frozen yogurt. YoWaffle has the yogurt, the toppings AND the waffles (and these are not your regular IHOP waffles). Would highly recommend to try it!!  The staff was friendly and cheerful. We were promptly greeted and asked if it was our first time (as in if we needed any help). Within a few minutes we had the froyo loaded with toppings and it was delicious. Love their outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad.  I prefer my waffles a little lighter and more airy or fluffy or whatever.  I suppose it's that way to absorb the liquid from the frozen yogurt but I chose to go with Nutella and whip cream and strawberries.  The service was awesome.  I'm open to another visit."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this place. Good to Great!! Really good recipe they use for the waffles. I do not know what it is, but it is very tasty! The toppings are great, A lot of different choices. I loved the Chocolate with fresh Fruit. Fro Yo on the side! it is nice and clean in here as well. Lots of parking in the lot. A nice new clean looking shopping center. When it is warm ,which  I will say is now and here to stay. You can sit outside and enjoy your snack. Although it is so filling it is like a meal. But, a sweet one."}
{"text":"Liege waffles meet Frozen Yogurt bar, Genius!!! Seriously @yo_waf has it going on, liege waffles made fresh and topped with everything you can imagine including frozen yogurt for only .47¢ an oz. With Happy Hour Monday's 2-5 30% off and BOGO 50% off Wednesday's. Last night was one sweet girls night. @seeittryitloveit"}
{"text":"Fun, easy and delicious! If you're looking for a good place for froyo you need to try this place. It has a fresh and modern decor, outdoor seating, and plenty of space to maneuver around when it's busy.  They have a good variety of regular yogurt as well a non-dairy choices. I love the toppings too (plenty of boboa poppers). They even keep the nuts well divided if your worried about allergies. If you like liege waffles then you can have one those too. They're tasty but only a special treat for me. They serve churros but I haven't tried one yet. We come here often."}
{"text":"O.k. I discovered liege waffles due to someone bringing me one to try at work, since that time I have been obsessed with them, chasing down the waffle trucks every weekend to get one of these delectable treats.  The other day I am driving down Higley and see a truck called Yo-Waffle and see an actual location at a strip mall where you can buy a waffle and load it up with whatever toppings you want!!!  I have found heaven on earth!!!  The waffles at Yo Waffle are every bit as good as the waffle truck variety AND COST LESS by about three dollars per waffle!!!!  The only downside for me was, we rode our bikes over to have a waffle for breakfast on a Saturday and the place doesn't open until 11:00 am.  My suggestion would be open earlier on weekends!!!  Please!!!!  Some people view these waffles as treats that go with some yogurt perhaps, I call it BREAKFAST and the most delectable kind you can buy!!!  So if the owner reads this, please consider opening earlier on the weekends.  I am assuming you have already tried an earlier opening, perhaps and it didn't work out, but I would five it a shot if you have not already done so, perhaps once this catches on you will have plenty of people coming in to make up the cost of the labor to run the store longer!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Also might want to consider using real whipped cream like the trucks do, that was the only thing that was not quite as good."}
{"text":"Swag vibe. Conversation invoking extreme sports videos play above your heads as you whittle away at the end of the day with friends.  The waffles, The yogurt, the toppings -this is not your run-of-the-mill yogurt strip.  Truly a fun place to be.  And the waffles are all that; Gilbert no need to chase that waffle truck around anymore."}
{"text":"I went in an hour before close and got two waffles that takes LESS than ten minutes to make. The teenage boy rolled his eyes at me like \"are you kidding me?\" And said \"umm..\" before he could finish I said \"you have an hour before close.\" He didn't have to top it, so what's the problem? We were handed over two burnt waffles for us to top, we tried eating them but they were disgustingly hard. I work in the food industry and I'd understand if it's 10 minutes before close, but it wasn't. There's no reason to be disrespectful to a customer like that.. The kid was super rude and unpleasant. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. I do not like frozen yogurt but I really like this place. Quality yogurt and toppings. Clean, family friendly, and great service. We will be back. This is now our family's favorite even though we drive by 4 other yogurt places on the way there."}
{"text":"First let me say, I really like this place. The waffles are great, the fro yo is great, and the toppings are awesome. However, I went there last night and my experience was sub par. After sampling some fro yo we decided to get some waffles. We asked for some fresh ones and one of the employees graciously obliged our request. Well after waiting for almost 15 minutes we received our waffles. The only problem was they were not cooked properly. They were very doughey and almost inedible. We returned the waffles and decided to leave as there were about 4 others who had been waiting almost as long as is to receive waffles. To add to the problem, there was only ONE waffle iron for the whole store. Waffle is in the name! Great place but a subpar experience that makes me hesitant to return and waste 20 minutes only to have to find another place for dessert. We went home and made our own waffles with ice cream! Hope they consider investing in an additional waffle iron or two, Give them a go for a good dessert! Hope your experience is better."}
{"text":"This a fairly new place for us.  We really like it in general.  All the yogurt is self served, and charged by weight.  They even have toppings that are hard to find in regular stores, such as the Big Kat Kit Kat bar!  Free samples ensure you get the stuff you really love!"}
{"text":"It's a cute place with a great location. Although, I wasn't too satisfied with any of the flavors- there was something \"off\" with all of the ones I sampled.  It definitely has potential, & I look forward to seeing the evolution of this joint as it matures."}
{"text":"Best waffles ever! I love the crunchy bits of caramelized sugar complimented by the soft, warm texture of the waffle itself. And you can make the craziest combination from the plethora of toppings available or keep it as deliciously simple as Nutella, whipped cream, and bananas.   Between frozen yogurt or waffles or both, everyone is sure to leave stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Love the customer service, the young girl working tonight seemed to love her job and asked us if it was our first time, Flavors were all good, great topping and the waffle was awesome! Cool concept and great atmosphere with the upbeat music playing!"}
{"text":"Yo waffle has waffles and frozen yogurt. I was disappointed the waffles are made and sitting under a light. I would prefer to have them made to order like waffle luv. To be honest I did not even get a waffle when we went since it looked like it was sitting there for a while. Frozen yogurt was good and they offered several favors. I got salted Carmel. Kids liked theirs as well. Just wish waffles were made for you. Yo waffle responded to me and let me know they will make the waffle fresh so I look forward to trying one."}
{"text":"Came here to try it out instead of the waffle food truck.  Waffle was good and they have many frozen yogurt flavors along with the whipped creme, strawberries, nutella and many other toppings.  If you're not in the mood for a waffle you can just get yogurt.  Price is almost half of what the waffle truck costs.  Both are good in their own way.  Recommend you try out Yo Waffle."}
{"text":"You had me at \"Yo\" and it only got better with \"Waffle\"! There is no denying frozen yogurt is great and waffles are amazing, but when you put the two together they become a match made in dessert heaven.   Yo Waffles features the Liège kind of waffles, which are basically brioche dough that has been coated with sugar to create crispy, caramelized, buttery, scrumptious, delight. Hot off the iron these lovelies are richer, denser, sweeter, and crispier than an average waffle. Yum! They even have gluten free waffles now, too!  Enjoy 14 different flavors of frozen yogurt daily, of which there is sure to be at least two dairy-free sorbets. You can never go wrong with a flavor like Triple Chocolate (so much chocolate in just one spot!) or for something straight out of summer, treat yourself to Valencia Orange swirled with it's best buddy Vanilla and you've got a Creamsicle in your cup...or on your waffle.   There are a ton of different toppings to choose from such as fruits, nuts, candy pieces, boba, Biscoff, Nutella, cereals like fruity pebbles, brownie bites or cheesecake pieces, and even freshly cut bananas if you request it! Oh, and don't forget the whipped cream on top!   The ultra friendly staff leaves you all smiles and yo' wanting more!"}
{"text":"Waffles were different than any of the other waffle places I've ever been! Not only different but out of this world delish!!! The place also has self serve frozen yogurt which is awesome! The manager was super friendly and very interactive with all the customers! Perfect place to bring a date or just hang out with friends. The place was spotless and tables were very clean! Well organized and 2 TV's to watch to help pass the time:) Awesome Place!"}
{"text":"This is a neat find in Gilbert. Great frozen yogurt and pretty decent waffles. The waffles are not as good as waffle crush, but it's a great idea. Topping are very high end. Fresh fruit and a lot of choices. Yogurt was very good too. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a nice little gem!  I went around Xmas time and they had a lot of fun seasonal flavors.  My favorite was the candy cane.  Their array of toppings was also impressive.  I did try the waffle too and it was a nice indulgent treat.  The staff was also helpful and friendly.  Will frequent more as the weather heats up."}
{"text":"The waffles are where it's at!! Load it up with biscoff and fruit! The frozen yogurt is great and what you should expect from self serve frozen yogurt! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"The flavor of the froyo tasted very \"fake\" the waffle was okay. Not very soft either."}
{"text":"We had various frozen yogurt combos and one waffle built with the suggestions on the board. SOOOOO GOOOD."}
{"text":"Awesome waffle with vanilla bean cream, warm Nutella, and some bananas, so freakin yummy.  I'm stuffed to the rafters.  Cool place, super clean and delicious toppings."}
{"text":"The frozen yogurt is the best here!!! Best flavors, best healthy options, best customer service!!! P.S. if you go late at night before they close they will give you the waffles they have made that didn't sell"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Waffles and Froyo works! Great place, great flavors and amazing topping selection. Keep it up! - Christopher Rees DPR Realty"}
{"text":"A little pricy. Frozen yogurt tastes like ice-cream. Very fresh, I like it with all fresh berries. Will go back, they have wifi, can spent some time inside when it's so hot outside."}
{"text":"One of the best frozen yogurt shops I have been too. Great service, very clean and delicious flavors. They even had cookie butter!  I got strawberry with a little bit of Belgian cookie. It was tough to choose which flavor because so many looked good. Normal amount of toppings, but they all seemed fresh and didn't look picked over or anything.   The young guy working the cash register was really nice and helpful. He offered me a punch card, and that's good because I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love their waffles!  Delicious!  Far better than what I've gotten from the food truck waffle businesses, and I don't have to stand outside in the heat to get it!  Plus, all the Nutella on top that I want.  Yum!"}
{"text":"It was our first time going to this place and the Workers were very helpful and nice! They give you this tiny cup to try their frozen yogurts while their making your fresh waffles if you decide to get one. Their waffles were great as well as the frozen yogurts and toppings. It was just a little too sweet for me that I needed a cup of water after finishing the whole thing. I would come back again and try other flavors. The biscoff is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"So yummy! The place is clean and has good music. Our waffles were made fresh and the yogurt was delicious. Perfect for a hot summer day"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everyone needs to try it at least twice! !  So many places sell the typical frozen yogurt but to add a waffle, every topping and syrup you can think of is a crazy thought ! I never would have thought they sold such a awesome dessert until i tried YoWaffle.    Pretty sure I died and went to heaven and came back with every bite. Moving from Tempe where I was walking distance from Yogurtland, I can say I won't be deprived of yogurt now that I found this gem and think I'm gonna be breaking up with Yogurtland for yowaffle.   The concept is simple and easy to follow and the waffles are to die for. Lots of family's and a great place for kids. Friendly staff, super good flavors and thoes waffles... taste like a doughnut on steroids."}
{"text":"Great location & the yogurt is actually pretty good. The topping bar has a lot to choose from, but if it's busy there's not a lot of seating!! I do like the waffles.   However my most recent visit was disappointing. I bought a groupon that stated 'one per person, one per visit'. To me that means each person in my party can use one $4 groupon at a time. Not to mention with the waffle each of my kids spent an additional $3 over the groupon price, BUT when my kids got up to pay we were stopped after the first groupon told we could only use one per family! I was disappointed. We won't be back again!!"}
{"text":"Yowaffle is amazing. The waffles are pretty epic if you ask me. They are Belgian style but so thick and dense. I would go there just for the waffles. Their new fro-yo flavors are great too. So much flavor and I like the variety. The staff are cool and very helpful/nice. Especially Tristyn, she's awesome."}
{"text":"The yogurt was good, but Unfortunately, I can't give a review on the waffles because they ran of spray to make the waffles with. Strange how a place that specializes in waffles and yogurt ran out of a main product. Disappointed because our young son was so excited to try a waffle and we were celebrating a birthday. The worker was very apologetic and nice. However, the boss/owner should make sure that when shifts change you know what product you are out of."}
{"text":"I was exposed to this place with the Yelp Ugly Sweater Christmas Event and I'm sooooooo glad it was placed here! BEST. WAFFLE. EVER. I'm going to give you a string of adjectives describing the waffle.  thick - dense - chewy - sweet - crispy - buttery  You won't find a fresh waffle like this anywhere else...particularly a waffle that you can turn around and place mounds of froyo on....  Go here. I wish there was one on all the corners."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. My friend told me to check this place out and I just developed a love for waffles, unfortunately I won't be going back here for waffles. I understood I had to wait for the waffle, but when I ordered off the menu, I was told that I had to make it on my own. I wasn't pleased with this; why would you have a menu if you don't make the item? At the end of the day, it's like a waffle and you add your own toppings like frozen yogurt. So my waffle was horrible because I don't know what to put on my waffle to make it taste like Waffle Crush. Aside from that, the frozen yogurt flavors are phenomenal! I usually don't go for the typical vanilla and chocolate, but it was so rich and good. They have refreshing flavors there that other places normally don't. I would come back just for the yogurt."}
{"text":"Great frozen yogurt and even better waffles. Extremely nice staff and a perfect location make this place a must try."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and dangerous if you're trying to watch your weight! The staff was welcoming today & super friendly & helpful which is awesome because I hate going somewhere for the first time and having that look of confusion on my face. The store is clean and the waffles are fresh...I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for a treat! Super flavors, lots of fresh toppings, and GREAT waffles. Mix and match any way you like. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fro yo spot I have been to.  They have a really good selection of frozen yogurt and get this you get the choice to put it on a WAFFLE which of course we did.   Plus if you get a regular bowl you can even add churros how awesome is that.   The decor is modern and the staff member helping was very helpful since it was our first time here.    If you don't know what to get they have a wall on giving you opinions to make your yogurt.    This is a must try spot in the area and we will be back"}
{"text":"One of the cleaner frozen yogurt shops around, also has very good flavors.  I don't really understand, or want a waffle...but i don't need to have one either.   The two different sized cups are at opposite ends of the store which are weird."}
{"text":"Their waffles are amazing -- they do something special I've never been able to re-create. They even have gluten-free waffles for those with allergies that my sister always gets and loves. I also always get frozen yogurt (my sister gets their dairy-free sherbert) and use their variety of toppings on both the waffle (mmm, whipped cream and fruit) and the frozen yogurt. It's a great place for a Girl's Night Out or a special date with your child. I love how conveniently it's located. Gilbert is coming alive!"}
{"text":"Great Fr Yo and cool concept with the waffles. Lots of boba options and the cookie butter was amazing."}
