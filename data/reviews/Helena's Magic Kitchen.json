{"text":"The once tragic mall at Village by the Grange is now a great place for lunch and people watching. The crowd of Chinatown locals, OCAD hipsters and AGO matrons are there for the international indie stalls in the food court. It's a quintessential Toronto experience.

Helena's stands apart with it's French country kitchen setup. They specialize in savoury pies and superfresh salads. I had a spinach quiche that actually tasted like spinach. The crust was pretty good and the egg filling just right, still moist but not runny. Could have used a bit more seasoning but that's easily corrected.

Salads sides are absolutely stellar. I tried a barley and white bean mix liberally flecked with fresh minced parsley, as well as one of the best coleslaws I've had in a long time.

All this for six bucks! In a city that often overreaches for food trendiness it's nice to see the basics done correctly."}
{"text":"Great food option if you're in the AGO neighbourhood. Everything is fresh, homemade and full of flavour.

You cannot go wrong with their offering of six periogies with two sides for $6 (including tax)! Be advised: these are not frozen, they're homemade, traditional periogies made with potato and cheese. I visit this place at least a few times a month and have converted a few co-workers into loyal customers as well. 

The couple who runs this place are also very nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Best place in the grange by far. Healthy, fresh and tasty food. Totally different style of food than what you usually find in a food court."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of salads and quiches. The roasted chicken is tasty and you can always get a somewhat indulgent potato pancake. Good for lunch. If there is magic, it is a good kind as far as I can tell."}
{"text":"This place is my go to during breaks from classes. Their quiches are great. Their potato lackeys are the best! Their pierogies are also delicious. If their mushroom sauce is offered, take it! Sucks that most stuff sells out during the lunch hour. Cute old couple runs this homemade place."}
{"text":"I really want the couple who runs this place to adopt me. I feel like I'd be so healthy. I always get the salads though, man, the quiches look pretty remarkable. Homecooked, beautiful, healthy food. I really like the side dishes though, they are seasoned just right and I always feel good after. Thanks, food-court mom and dad!"}
{"text":"The couple who run this place can be seen first thing in the morning prepping all the food, and it's clear everything is really homemade. Great deals for lunch - have tasted most of the salads which are great. Their chicken of the day is always the same- roasted legs/ thighs with mushroom sauce, but it's good. Stuffed chicken and the pies are great, and you should def taste the potato pancakes. A nice fresh homemade tasting option for lunch"}
{"text":"tasty home cooking at a reasonable price.  Usually, these places oversalt to gain flavor but this place had simple yet delicious dishes."}
{"text":"The lovely couple that run this place are so committed to doing something different. Every day, they prepare delicious, home-made food that stands a clear cut above the other fast-food joints in the Grange. 

There are actual healthy options here, and delicious, thoughtfully prepared ones at that (their side-dishes include broccoli, beets, wheatberries, barley, lentils, etc). The portions are generous and the prices are SO reasonable. 

My go-to for lunch in the Grange, hands down!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I absolutely love this place for fast food. Their food is always fresh,my go to food is their salad for under $4 and you can choose 3 different salads.  I got their large salad before , and you get to choose 5 different salads which is huge! But mmmm it did fill my tummy! 

I also love their quiche. Wow they really do make delicious food"}
{"text":"Excellent food for fantastic value from a price perspective.  Their pies are very flavourful in particular and it's wonderful to see healthy and tasty food being provided for an unbeatable price.

Truly a gem of a place and on of Toronto's must under the radar secrets.  Really hard working good couple that are the worker-proprietors."}
{"text":"honestly im quite upset about this place. i have bought my lunch from here at least two times now and each visit was a disappointment... 

the first time i went i ordered the potato latkes with the green quinoa (it was quinoa with maybe cilantro idk?!) and the potato salad. the latkes were a huge letdown. it wasn't exactly too flavourful and idk it just didn't do my tastebuds justice. the quinoa thing was absolutely dreadful dear lord never again. and for the potato salad, it was the only remotely edible thing 
**i bought this before the lunch hour and my food was not hot.. not even that warm :(

the second time I went I ordered the shepherds pie because GORL I LOVE SHEPHERDS PIE AND I WAS LEGIT SO HAPPY I FOUND A PLACE WITH SHEPHERDS PIE (yall hit me up with some bombass restaurants or food joints with shepherds pie plsss) for the side orders i got the potato salad again and tried the coleslaw this time .
first of all it was yet another let down again .... like the meat was alright but the MASHED POTATOES MAN WHYYYYYY I'm really particular with my mashed potatoes like they gotta be smooth like a baby's bottom and buttery and just NOT GRAINY OKAY AND CLUMPY BUT IT WAS EXACTLY THAT .. GRAINY AND CLUMPY (D::;) but yeah potato salad tasted weird this time but the coleslaw was okay 
** food was again not hot and not warm 

overall im PROBABLY not gonna come again (i do wanna try the stuffed chicken breast) but yeah despite all the good reviews HOMEGIRL can not give this place a lot of stars :(

IM SORRY THE COUPLE THT WORKS THERE"}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far and while I can't say it's the best thing I've tasted, it's good value for a home cooked meal. I got the roasted chicken special which came with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken was somewhat dry, but you did get 3 pieces (2 drum sticks and a thigh). I'm also not sure if it was actually a chicken that was roasted or it was slow cooked (they did pull it out of a slow cooker...perhaps to keep it warm). It was a hearty meal, but nothing to write home about. I would come back to try the other chicken specials or the quiche as they looked more appetizing and popular."}
{"text":"Homestyle food that tastes excellent and is reasonably priced. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food for cheap prices. I found the beans in their bean salads a bit underdone, but other than that, it's been some really nice home cooking done right."}
{"text":"My favourite place to have lunch in Village by the Grange. The pies and latkes are hot and delicious. I also love their carrots from the salad bar (which consisted of almost all that I didn't care for). The stuffed chicken was filling. And best of all, it's reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Prepared with love and all that home cooked charm you miss when buying lunch to go. A staple in the Grange across from OCAD University, menu items range from delicious quiches, classic fried chicken, a range of cold salads and mixed sides plus some mean potato latkes."}
{"text":"Excellent prices for the portions you get. A mom and pop kind of shop. Has good amount of varieties and always a lineup."}
{"text":"Eastern European grub in the Village by the Grange food court. I expected more smoke and incantations at this Magic Kitchen, but all I got was lunch. Pretty good selection for food court fare: quiche, soups, sandwiches, pies, and literally more side dishes than they can fit on the counter. Bowls of bean salads obscured coleslaws, beet salad and other mixes. The food is decent and the prices aren't bad (though expensive by this food court's standards). I'll go back.

Obligatory Title Pun: One HELL-eva Magic Kitchen

Menu Readability: Scribbled in chalk overhead.

Need to mention: They make dessert daily.

What this place teaches me about myself: When I heard Eastern European I used to think \"strippers.\" Now I think \"beet salad.\" And also strippers."}
{"text":"Terrific place for lunch!

ATMOSPHERE: Homecooked goodness. Located inside the food court at The Grange, the place is a student hub. Amidst various selections here, Helena's stands out with their food.

SERVICE: Friendly. A lovely couple run this place!

PRICE: Average food court-type prices. There are lots of options just to order single items, or get combos for lunch which includes 1 main and 2 sides. 

FOOD: Fried potato latkes are AMAZING. Served with a huge dollop of sour cream - it's available as an add-on or as your main. I also love ALL their savoury pies and quiches. Such a great selection to choose from. But remember: Get there EARLY or they may be sold out of most of their delish pies and quiches.

Their sides are super tasty! You'd think it's only the mains that keep them going, but don't overlook the various veggie/salad side dishes. I've been trying to order something different every time - and I'm never disappointed.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not sure what type of sorcery this place employs, but good enough for a quick lunch spot if you're in a rush and want a healthy bite.

Not much to say about the place itself since it's a stall in a food court under the Village by the Grange.

I've pretty much tried all the quiche offerings they have and regardless of the choice, it's quite on point.  Served with two sides of your choice and you may seriously need a couple minutes make that decision with their impressive spread of sides including beet salad (my fav), potato salad, tomato and cucumber salad, coleslaw, bean salad and others.

Definitely will need to try their latkas on my next visit.  They look absolutely delish."}
