{"text":"Came here on business a few nights ago. The food was ok - which is why I didn't give it 1 star, but the service was absolutely terrible. We started out at the bar where after taking our first drink order, the bartender couldn't be bothered to check in with us for another round; so we sat aimlessly for 25 minutes with empty glasses.  Next came dinner where we were told (by others) that we had to try the steak and the lamb. Great, I love both! One of my partners orders the lamb. How do you like it cooked the server asked. Medium well my partner replied. Yeah, that's going to take about 90 minutes the waiter smirked. One of the clients who was with us wanted the steak, same thing, medium well, going to take 60 minutes. Clearly this place doesn't like cooking steaks at any temperature above medium. Which I don't understand...If I'm paying $50+ for a steak, and I want it burnt, give it to me burnt. I don't get it. I immediately told the waiter that we were going to leave because of the lack of accommodation. Fortunately the client insisted he'd get something else. This was so embarrassing, I can promise I will never return here."}
{"text":"We had a group dinner here the other night.  The family platters were all wonderful, especially the meat one at the end of our dinner. I would come back here next time we are in town for sure."}
{"text":"Never ever go back there!!  My husband and I were here for lunch 3 days ago and we paid 130$ for the food that it wasn't special to worth the money and both of us got food poisoning!! We still aren't ok.  Don't wast your time and your money to get sick. One more thing, all the menu is in Italian language and you have to figure it out.  Low quality, small space"}
{"text":"Delicious every time. I could drink the olive oil by itself."}
{"text":"NOTE: I'm purely reviewing the Market side. I've been to the restaurant, and I remember it being tasty, but it's been too long to really review my meal there.  I like Mercato. I do. I think they have the tastiest arancini possibly ever (and I LOVE that I can take them home to heat up), I think they have great pizza dough, and Mama Cathy's doughnuts are AMAZING. We frequent the market side because it is down the street, so it's quite convenient. As an Italian woman who likes to cook, I do require some things from Calgary's fabulous Italian markets in order to make what I need to. Mercato has a few very delicious things, and everything is always fresh. The quality is pretty fantastic. However... they lose a whopping 3 stars for their prices. The convenience of Mercato keeps me coming back (and the arancini, and the doughnuts, and some of the baking), but I am so disappointed with how much they jack up the prices of things. Just about anything that can be bought at Mercato can be bought at Spinelli's or Lina's for about a third or half of the cost. And at the same quality. So, all in all, Mercato has some amazing things, and the food items that they make in-house can be really worth it, but they gouge you like crazy on the prices. Avoid buying your pasta, pizza dough, oils, sauces and deli stuff here, and just get their pre-made take-home items."}
{"text":"Amazing, very pricey, but worth it!!! We had 2 orders of the steak, the mushrooms and the caprese with a bottle of red wine. The server was pleasant and was nice enough to offer samples of some of the wines before we chose a bottle. The caprese was ok for me but my wife really enjoyed it. The steaks were cooked perfectly and were excellent. The mushrooms were pretentious and super overpriced. They tasted amazing but holy moly 19$ for a small bowl of mushrooms."}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT in Calgary. Amazing food, great ambiance and great location."}
{"text":"When visiting my son in Calgary we always make a night at Mercato. I decided to finally write a review because I don't understand what all the fuss is about and why it gets such glowing reviews. Coming from Vancouver the city has some amazing Italian restaurants so my standards are high. I find Mercato to be pricey for what you get and not backed up by quality nor flavor. I find the dishes are heavily salted and not very exciting. I am sure there must be better Italian in Calgary than this."}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant by far. We love sitting at the kitchen bar and watching the food preparation as we eat. The steak is to die for."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the communal seating we had I actually enjoyed. It reminds me of some restaurants Ive been to in NYC. the staff are very knowledgable, but I do have to agree, its a place to go for a special night out, since the bill was well over $100 each, with a couple drinks, a few shared apps, a main and a dessert each. Ive heard its hard to get a last minute reservation, so book ahead if you are a group! The only reason I didnt give it a four was due to the pricing."}
{"text":"I have typically not preferred Italian food over other types of food (ie. Mexican,Indian, French) because I am not a big pasta eater, but Mercato takes it to a whole new level. I have been for personal and work and the family style serving is fun for all. Nothing went to waste regardless of how tight our pants got. The restaurant is less formal than some of those stuffy higher end Italian restaurants - very welcoming. Always awesome service too!"}
{"text":"This place boasts to be one of the best italian restaurants and was recommended by many people. Went on a Thursday night and it was packed. We got seated by the counter table with the open kitchen in the centre. To me, it is not enjoyable to watch people prepare your food and I think the whole idea is a show-off.   We ordered a salad, 20 once steak with wild mushroom and a pasta dish to share. The steak is definitely a good quality of steak, so as long as you don't screw it, it can't go wrong. The seasoning is very simple, just pepper and salt. The mushroom is cooked perfectly but it is expected for a restaurant of this scale. The pasta was freshly prepared but nothing special. Overall, the dishes are good but not memorable at all. It doesn't leave you feeling satisfied or wowed, just \"alright\". I am not being a snob, but the strategy of this place is to use top-notch ingredients with no real culinary talent. The open kitchen actually exposes their weakness. The entire crew is like a line cook in MacDonald. They didn't transform the food and bring it to the next level. I left feeling unimpressed, un-inspired and a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday dinner on a Friday night.  We were a group of 8 girls and as usual, late!  The restaurant still held our table and we had quick service. Wine was delicious, appetizers & mains were fast, and the cappuccinos hot.  Highlights: open kitchen, nice staff, family style service Best food: Caprese salad was full of fresh ingredients, Swordfish carpaccio was a mix of great flavours (good to share), and the Ribs were so tasty we couldn't get enough.  Their pasta was the perfect texture and you can't go wrong with any.  I'll be returning here!    Other tips: lots of Seafood on the menu and Pasta.  Calamari wasn't the greatest"}
{"text":"This Restaurant is fantastic. The food is true it's Italian roots and the Market is amazing, if not a teeny bit on the expensive side. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a fantastic meal and experience"}
{"text":"I visited Mercato for the first time on a Saturday evening.  Our group reserved for four at the counter a couple of weeks in advance, a definite MUST if you want to assure yourself any seat in the restaurant - the place was packed.  The food was very good although you would not have a great deal of choice if you were a strict vegetarian. If fish is in your diet, you're set. I loved the casual platting and option of communal eating - our group of four shared everything. The wine we chose was wonderful too.   The ambiance was great. I highly recommend sitting at the counter so you can watch your food be cooked and prepared.  Keep in mind though that if loud isn't your thing, this is not the restaurant for you.   The price:  We shared 2 appetizers, 2 starter meals, 2 main courses, 2 deserts, and 2 bottles of wine.  For four people, the bill ran over $360 with tip.  Mercato means a special dinner out for us.   I recommend you visit Mercato at least once to enjoy its atmosphere, food, and energy.  I'll be going back the next time we have a special occasion to celebrate."}
{"text":"Mercato, though unique, is quite salty, and causes your clothes to smell a lot like kitchen.  The food is good, and I like the Italian family style dining, but other restaurants in Calgary seem to pop up on my list before Mercato when I want to go it to enjoy an expensive and delightful meal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to rate this place high, but all I can give is a 3.5 stars - sorry   I expected more from Mercato. Everything in my salad was super salty (felt like I was drinking sea water) , baked mussels were okay (could have been fresher - fun concept though ,the bread crumbs reminded me of the sand) and the pasta was alright (I've had much better homemade pasta's - to name one off the top of my head, one place from Calgary would be Teatro).    Definately didn't feel like I was back in Italy enjoying their simple fresh dishes...    To end it in a positive note, the latte was good and maybe the market will surprise me."}
{"text":"Had the large portion of Tagliatelle pasta, Bisticca Rib steak ( smaller portion) with Fagiolini beans. Really good and filling for the 2 of us.  Cost wise was about $100.00 and includes 2 wine drinks. I've paid more, got less from and not near as good from other restaurants.  Sure service is slow at times but they are really busy most of the time. I think any good restaurants that are any good are really busy. The only disappointment is getting a reservation for when I want, trying even 5 days in advance."}
{"text":"This is my go to Italian restaurant! Specifically this location.  Love the market, love takeaway as well as the open kitchen sit down.  You can call or make reservations via opentable.  The service is impeccable. They are so friendly and knowledgeable.  To put it in a few words: Fresh pasta and the best steak you'll ever share.  I've blogged about this, a while ago, and am trying to get the word out here since urbanspoon has shut down."}
{"text":"I've been to Mercato for dinner three times in the past two years.  It's hard for me to review it objectively as, honestly, it's out of my price range for regular dining.  Each time I've been to Mercato I have been treated by a generous friend or family member.  I also struggle to review Mercato objectively as I spent several years living in Italy and Italian food is close to my heart.    I guess I'll start by saying that the food at Mercato is really good.  On my last visit I had the bruschetta as an appetizer (one classic tomato, one with eggplant and a third I don't recall).  It's something like $17 for three slices of bread with toppings.  Three really good slices of bread with really good toppings, true.  As a vegetarian I can't eat any of the main courses listed on the menu, so I usually like to order a first-course sized pasta (a little smaller than the \"entree\"-sized) and then share lots of vegetable side dishes.  On my last visit I had the gnocchi, which were amazing.  A little heat to the sauce, lots of parmesan (it might have been pecorino or another similar cheese), and a crumble of almonds and pistachios on top.  It was great.  Easily worth the $15 price tag (it might have been a dollar or two more or less).  For shared sides we had proscuitto-wrapped asparagus (it got rave reviews, I can't eat the proscuitto), zucchini with fresh ricotta (to die for) and green beans with pine nuts (also amazing).  Vegetable sides are meant for sharing and run about $10-15 each, if I recall correctly.  Bottles of wine start around $45 and desserts (which I never have room for) are around the $10-15 price point as well (I believe).  As mentioned earlier I never eat main courses at Mercato, but most look to be upwards of $25 and do require the additional contorni (side dishes).    The food at Mercato is to die for, and it's a great upscale choice.  I have a hard time believing the price is justified (especially when I could get similar food at half the price in Italy) but then again... you won't find Italian that good for any cheaper here in Calgary.    One thing that I do have to say is that I've always found the service at Mercato makes me uncomfortable.  I've had the same server all three times I've been, and she's often spoken brusquely to the people at my table and used hostile body language.  In all three visits I don't think she's cracked a smile once, and she makes me so uncomfortable that I dread ending up in her section.  Maybe if you buy a $500 bottle of wine she'll warm up to you, but until then you should visit Mercato for the food, definitely not the service.    (Oh, and Mercato has a little market attached where you can buy fresh and packaged Italian foods.  The stuff in the deli cases looks amazing... but expensive... while most of the packaged stuff can be purchased at much lower prices at Lina's Italian Market.)"}
{"text":"Good atmostphere; good food; pasta was excellent, I could tell it's not the dried pasta; tiramisu is one of the best I've had; interesting open kitchen concept.  Complaints: -a bit over priced even the food was good. -use way too much salt and olive oil!! (Food didn't end up too salty though) -too much instructions from the waiter....I'd much rather read it on a menu -VERY LOUD -the cut of the steak is a little more fatty than I'd like, but others might like it -good to sit facing the kitchen and watching all the action, otherwise might get a little dull and loud and bored as it takes a little longer to get the food.  Good place for once in a while dining out."}
{"text":"Fabulous!   The food was terrific and the atmosphere was entertaining, warm and inviting!   A definite do not miss restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went to Mercato last night and I will say the food was excellent and in my personal opinion a bit over priced but it was a special occasion dinner and not as salty as other reviews identified however as this was my first time there, I wasn't impressed to be crammed in like sardines in a bar seating right in front of an open grill. I don't want to be touching the person beside me (who I'm not dining with)when I cut my food.  Reservation was book well in advance for a birthday dinner, as indicated on reservation so would of been nice to of had a more intimate dining table. Certainly would of asked to be moved but very busy in there. As well very noisy.  The service was ok, nothing to rave about. I understand it was very busy in there but our server didn't exude the wow factor, more like hurry up and order as I'm too busy for you. For the price we paid for dinner, sitting at a bar like setting was not ideal.  Will I go back there, not totally sure."}
{"text":"You can't find a better vibe in the city. Stop by for a quick lunch in the deli or an amazing night of laughter with friends in the dining room. From the antipasto plate, to the bistecca you will not be disappointed.  Mercato continues to surprise us with its amazing flavours week after week.  Food, service, vibe perfect"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I was blown away with the food. It was a fun experience as well. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Mercato is an excellent experience, as one who has grown up with excellent Italian food, I can certainly vouch for the authenticity of what I have tasted. The open concept setup of the restaurant with a view into the kitchen is lovely,  and intimate, yet because seating is limited, I have ended up at the far end of the bar next to the rest rooms a few times. The wait staff are attentive and I have yet to have experienced anything different. The Bistecca is always lovely, traditional with rock salt and arugula, is meant for two and paired with another small main or appetizer, is more than enough for a table of two."}
{"text":"Love this place at lunch to people watch and enjoy authentic Italian cuisine.  So excited they are opening their next location in West Springs.  Only con is you may get fat!"}
{"text":"Italian is probably one of my fave cuisines because I LOVE pasta. When you go somewhere like Mercato, you can always expect beautifully crafted dishes made with the freshest ingredients.   Nothing beats chef made gnocchi, so naturally I went with the calabrese sausage & apricot gnocchi and the bruschetta to start. The portions here are perfect, enough to satisfy but not so much that you feel overly full. I think they do this so you have room for dessert  I'm not usually one for sweets, but you can't deny yourself the tiramisu at Mercato - it's light yet full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice relaxing atmosphere.  Go here to have a long relaxing dinner.  Good high quality food."}
{"text":"Finally, I've found an Italian restaurant that serves great food and meets it's own expectations: keeping it simple.  I would give this experience 4.5 stars.  By \"keeping it simple\" does not refer to Kraft dinner-like simplicity, what Mercato does well is utilize the traditional methods, ingredients, preparation that has worked so well in the past. It delivers quality dishes representative of regional (and house hold) Italian cuisine--resulting in a succinct message that connects with its eaters.    Like some of the other reviewers had said that the price is pretty high, and it's true.  But, if you want an atmosphere that is lively (because eating in a quiet Italian setting is just wrong), and dishes that are prepared in a traditional fashion and tasty too, then do it (pay the price).  It's cheaper than flying to Italy.  My Italian family members would enjoy Mercados, I'm sure you will too.   Dishes ordered: Antipasta - assorted cuts, cheese and   The risotto with cuttle fish - looked unattractive (like a slop of grounded black beans) but tasted heavenly (especially if you're a risotto fan).  Texture of the rice was done perfectly (not too mushy and soft).   Spaghetti with light tomato sauce - simple and done right.  Noodles are hand-made (you can tell) and like hand-made tortillas it really brings the dish together with a simple and flavourful sauce that is not too \"heavy\".   Veal and steak (I can't remember the cut--rib eye I think)   Again seasoned perfectly (not too salty) and cooked just right (not too dry).     Egg Plant and Mushroom/Fungi   Mixed berries cheese cake = wow"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an afterwork glass of wine and some nibblies with a friend who had just returned from Italy (we were trying to slowly re-integrate him into society after a vacation of drinking wine and eating Italian nibblies).  We wanted to sit outside but it had recently rained so the hostess went to dry things off for us. She seemed a litle put out buy this task but did it quickly enough.  Our server was awesome, and made great recommendations for olives, salamis and cheese treats to try. Everything lived up to her enthusiasm and descriptions. She was also very accommodating when it started to rain again, and moved us inside. When we lingered a little longer than expected, she happily moved us again to the bar (our second table was needed for reservations). Never once did we feel like we were inconveniencing her.  I really want to come back and check out the market and also try dinner as everything was smelling wonderful as we were leaving (dinner crowd was starting to be served). Its a great spot with a lovely patio (rain aside) whether you are trying to get over a recent vacation or just want a nice place to hang out and pretend you are on vacation."}
{"text":"I ordered the porchetta sandwich on focaccia twice now.  It was truly amazing the first time and I thought a complete repeat.  The second time it was mostly pork fat and I don't think I will repeat. There were a few items in the deli I wanted to order, however I needed to return to the core for work and didn't want to look like I went grocery shopping.  I had a hard time hearing the staff, as they seemed to mumble a bit, as it was a bit loud in the place.  However one customer I was talking too was quite interesting and a her striking good looks is another reason I would most certainly return."}
{"text":"VERY.....that seems to be the first word that comes to mind after last night's dinner VERY salty VERY noisy VERY good service VERY good pastas VERY over rated ...... The bistecca was beautifully cooked and presented but WAY TO SALTY......and I love salt.   Any of Calgarys  better beef houses can do a better job seasoning a slab of meat.... The  pasta and sauce were OUTSTANDING.....could the secret be Italian tomatoes? And yet even this was a touch on the salty side. VERY pricy wine list VERY smoky if you are seated anywhere close to the kitchen. ....which may be fun to watch for some but I would prefer to talk to my dinner company which is hard to do because it is VERY noisy. I cannot give Mercato more than 3 stars..."}
{"text":"Mercato is a great Deli/Restaurant in Mission.  The food is great, if a bit overpriced.  This restaurant has a a great atmosphere.  The decor is modern but very airy and Californian/Italian.  During the weekday lunch, it is a business crowd hangout, so I cannot recommend this place for a non-business lunch at that time."}
{"text":"Mercato is the best restaurant in Calgary.  Always delicious with impeccable food and service.   Highly recommend it for a truly amazing experience."}
{"text":"As usual a fantastic meal, ribeye steak, linguine vongole, asparagus(wrapped in prosciutto) bought a bottle of wonderful Merlot, recommended by our beautiful server ( Roxy), brought my only bottle of brunello, for a small corsage fee.  Everything was excellent from the chef to the wonderful young lady at the door."}
{"text":"Wide great selection of wine!! The food is expensive but it's work every single penny!! The lamb is to die for! Make reservations way in advance though"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp! Canada, we found this local treasure on the day we decided to visit it.  After verifying with the restaurant on its dress code (none) and children policy (none), we challenged the Yelp! suggested dress code (dressy) with our 6 and 8 year old daughters in causal winter layers and boots.  The restaurant is very urban and hip, much like a NYC restaurant  \"Otto\" that I visited last year.  The staff was super friendly.  I did make a reservation for 1:30 p.m. for lunch earlier that morning but the place was busy on a Saturday afternoon.  Upon our arrival, the hostess apologized and explained that the table would be available in 10 minutes and invited us to browse the store during that time.  We were intrigued with the truffle oils, capers, on-site bottling of olive oil and various Italian ingredients.  As we were about to sit in the bar tables in the store (odd place for it but appreciated under the circumstances), the hostess came and offered us the corner station on the bar that just opened up, apparently a highly coveted spot in the restaurant, which we happily accepted.  We watched with great fascination as the chefs work in the kitchen and the waiter offered excellent Italian red wine options by the glass, which my husband was super impressed with.  We ordered their daily special in appetizer portion, ok but not spectacular.  The amazing dish we enjoyed was pasta with fresh tomato and a hint of chili spices, thanks to a friendly patron seated next to my daughter.  Just don't ask me the name of it since all the names were Italian and not familiar to me.  Who knew that simply fresh tomatoes, pasta, and spices can create such a phenomenal dish.   We also added a side of brocollini, so good in every way!   Turns out, the restaurant is casual for business casual for lunch and accepting of children.  My husband and I loved it.  While I wish had more than 3 options for dessert, we did thoroughly enjoyed our lattes with a sponge cake and cheesecake.  Their cheesecake is made with ricotta cheese which gave it a lighter texture than your traditional cheesecake.  Neither cakes were overly sweet, just perfect for me.    The kids loved both.   While to meal was a bit pricey ($140) for 4 people, we did order quite a bit of food (couple glasses of wine, 2 italian sodas, 3 entrees, 2 lattes, and 2 desserts).  I thought it was well worth it. Having gone to many Italian restaurants, I have to say that this is definitely worth the effort of trekking there in the cold winter weather.  I loved the ambiance, service and food quality.  I just know that my trip is off to great start and I'll have to put my new-year resolution to start my low-carb diet off until after this vacation."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretentious and expensive. I have eaten there a few times (as a guest) and it was okay but not a good value for the price. Their in store grocery bottled olive oil is to die for and worth the silly price (I could.. drink it straight). The takeout from the grocery is expensive but good quality - cheaper then eating out."}
{"text":"The food was okay but what's up with the full charge for a coffee refill?  This restaurant is not inexpensive.  You would think that they'd at least include one free refill with the original cup of coffee.    My brother-in-law ordered the halibut and it was tasty but that's all that came on the plate - one piece of fish.  Again, is it that expensive to include a small amount of pasta tossed with a bit of olive oil to accompany the fish on the plate?  Not only would it be a nice side with the fish but the presentation would be much more appealing.  I ordered the clams vongole and had them add pasta to it and it was delicious but EXPENSIVE and my husband had the special and it was good as well.    It's just too bad about the little things that can inhibit one from returning any time soon or giving it at least a three star rating.  A friend recently told me they went and were not impressed at all.  What amazes me is that when I drive by the restaurant usually appears busy but it's in a high density area with few Italian restaurants.  If you have a vehicle, there are far great restaurants in town."}
{"text":"We all know the pasta and stuff is good. Really good. But the meatloaf sandwich is the best in the city. Easy.  And the bun it's served on is stupid good good. No really. Stupid good. If you wanna quick pressed sandwich that stands up to any in the city eat it. And the donuts are too good. Oh yeah if you like olive oil Uncle Luigi's is only available there and is worth the trip. Quit wasting time and go here."}
{"text":"I only ate on the deli side, and I was not disappointed with the wide selection of antipasti, cheeses, meats and prepared meals, all of excellent quality (I am extrapolating based on those I tried). I give it a 3 star because overall the prices are much higher than at my favourite Italian hang-outs, Lina's and the Italian Supermarket where I find the quality and selection at par, and on top the atmosphere in those two supermarkets is much more interesting and laid back than at Mercato."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner.  We started with the pasta special and followed it up with the green beans and pork chop (another special).   It was beyond delicious, the pasta was perfect.  We ordered a half order of the pasta, which I would recommend if you are planning on eating something else as the portion sizes are huge.  The pork chop was cooked perfectly.  We ended the night with an Americano and cheesecake!  It was a perfect meal, so much so, we ordered another half order of the pasta for dinner for the next night!  Great food, great service....wonderful!"}
{"text":"My sister & I decided to surprise my parents with an anniversary dinner at Mercato.  Mercato proved to be the perfect choice.  We opted to sit at the bar which faces the chef. When you sit right at the bar, you get the priveledge of watching the chef cook everything. We were mesmorized by his professionalism. He was a TRUE chef, tasting a spoon of EVERY dish that went out. I felt like I was in an episode of Hell's Kitchen...well, without the Hell part.  We ordered a bunch of different dishes, but our absolute favourite was the risotto. I'm usually not a fan, but this stuff was heaven on a plate! It was light, well cooked and absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend you borrow the idea and treat someone you love to a dinner at Mercato. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I grew up in Renfrew and frequented the Italian Supermarket owned by the family that now own Mercato. I'd go in and stock up and was greeted by one of the \"mama's\" who always added a little something to my basket as a thank you for shopping here and supporting them. I always loved the experience and felt very special.  I was very excited for the family when they moved to Mission and opened Mercato ( and yes, I understand the family dynamics involved ). I love the deli and will drive across the city for the spicy sausage (sans fennel) to add to my own home made Italian recipes. I will overlook the price on certain items because they are so tasty. The Franca sandwich is my favorite sandwich in Calgary and well worth the wait and price. I will always buy a latte at Mercato, even though Starbucks is across the street.   However, there are very few items I will splurge for in the deli, and I most certainly will not eat in the restaurant again. The first time I visited was for lunch shortly after they opened. After $80 for lunch (for 2 people) without liquor, I left hungry. I get the whole \"slow food\" thing, but come on.   Our last experience at Mercato was before a 7:30 puck drop at the dome. Our reservation was for 5:30. We FINALLY got our food at 7:05 (the server knew we had a game to go to) and after devouring it, was presented with a ridiculous bill. Keep in mind, we had 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, 4 al a carte items and 2 glasses of wine between 4 people. Let's just say, the bill started with a 4. I'm pretty sure the meal was good, but eating a \"gourmet\" meal in 10 minutes doesn't do it justice.   I'm not a follower, so I'm not inclined to go to places to see and be seen. I think people will tolerate the ridiculous prices and the off-handed service just so they can say they've eaten here. Not me.  I'll continue to spend my extra money on the 2 or 3 familiar items I used to buy when the market was in Bridgeland; Sausages, a Franca sandwich and a latte."}
{"text":"Hubby took me for a surprise dinner for my birthday back in November and we both loved it!  The food was wonderful, the staff helpful and the dessert... to die for!  Our server happily answered any questions, gave his favourites as suggestions and made us feel right at home.  We would happy go back for another celebration with just the two of us or with friends."}
{"text":"Update Nov 2017 Even with having a reservation, parties that came after us (with no reservation) were sat ahead of us... extremely rude!    --"}
{"text":"Make a Reservation. That's all I have to say. Every time we attempted to go it was the spur of the moment kinda thing.  It's all about sharing at Mercato's. Appetizer/Pasta/Meat Dish/Stuff on the side. You pick from each of the categories and go straight to heaven. Our tomatoes were vine ripened in Holland. I didn't know that would matter, but it did. :) Thank you Holland.  We had lamb for the meat dish, and it was probably the best lamb I have ever tried. Our waitress was young/ cool, and very knowledgeable in helping us match our wine to our dinner. The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  This place is a must if you enjoy italian food! I was clearly born into the wrong family.  Ciao Ciao"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I have been here two other times while visiting Calgary from out of town. This past weekend, we made an impromptu trip down for the weekend and wanted to have dinner here on Friday night. As I suspected, it was impossible to get a table without having reservations (not to mention this time of year many restaurants are busy with holiday parties and private events). So instead, we ended coming here for lunch on Saturday. We were seated at the counter top overlooking the chefs.  Our food was cooked to perfection - the bistecca (our must-have) was perfectly seasoned and a tender medium rare. The mussels baked in parchment paper were delicious to start, and the side order of brussel sprouts - smoky and savoury and delicious! *sigh* we were beyond stuffed. For drinks, we ordered a small bottle of moscato d'asti and it was sparkly and perfectly sweet - just the way we like it!  The main chef manning the stove tops was friendly and excellent at his job - watching him make risotto was mesmerizing as he uses the motion of his wrist to mix the risotto in the pan. He looked like he was enjoying himself and in turn, so did we!  Do yourself a favor, make a reservation and come here for no reason at all except for good food, good atmosphere, and an all 'round good time..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and leave yourself plenty of time for the four course Italian family style dinner. It's incredible and worth both the time and expense. I normally don't care to sit by the kitchen but a seat at the bar gives a fantastic view of all that goes on and comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the food was very good. The octopus salad was great and the pasta was good. Service was very good, my server was there at all the right times and offered a wine suggestion when she saw I was unsure of what to order. I took her suggestion and ordered a glass. The wine had that 'it's been open for a while' taste and there was sediment at the bottom. Not a big deal so I ordered another, figured new bottle deserves a chance. New glass, same taste and sediment again. Not cool to be suggesting something just to empty the dregs of a few bottles.  Tried really hard to find a reason this might happen and couldn't  come up with one. I asked for the bill and left a bit disappointed. Not likely to go back and might tell one or two people about my experience."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 today. I think Mercatos was having an off day. Besides the caprese salad, the two pastas my friend and I ordered were not very good. I will be nonetheless. Mercatos on 4th is one of my favourite places to dine in Calgary."}
{"text":"After bring introduced to this place last year I couldn't wait to return.  Everything is delicious and you want to keep eating and trying every dish. Salads proteins and wines with a view of the kitchen if you need something to look at or possibly have some time to study how to handle these dishes on the fire.   This rating is for the restaurant as I think there might be a deli here as well"}
{"text":"First of all, the prices for what you get are ridiculous. $20 for a small bowl of pasta (Tagliatelli) in tomato sauce that my 13 year old could make. We were told it was the top seller...why? Because it was the cheapest thing on the menu. Their tuna was $56 served with a couple of pieces of cauliflower on the plate and not even a salad on there. It was bland but the deep fried cauliflower was good.  We were in last night for dinner and were more than just disappointed with the pricing and food. Nothing was \"gourmet\" it was pretty plain food for all dishes chosen.  While the staff were personable, the pricing and delivery of food was sub-par. We had 7 people in our group. The food was brought out for 2 people who had the same dish and everyone else got nothing. Appetizers for the same two were sent out next. We, who got our food first, had to eat is so it would not get cold and we had to ask for the food for others. We had almost finished our meals before their food arrived. Sub-par. Don't go."}
{"text":"Mercato's atmosphere is upscale dining with extremely soft lighting at dinner, a bar area, and an open kitchen with bar seating to watch the chefs at work. The menus must be ever-changing as this restaurant is too posh to have skimped and only purchased paper menus. If you are unaccustomed to fancy food items the menu might seem a bit daunting unless you use Google. My husband and I settles on the Brushetta sampler of 3 different large crustini brushettas pre-cut to share for $20, the Gnocchi in a yellow beet pesto sauce with crushed pistachios for $34, and the Bistecka which was an 18oz sliced and bone in perfectly medium cooked steak served on a think cutting board with a small arugala garnish salad for $55. Everything was amazing! (though neither of us were fans of the marscapone bruschetta...it was just too much marscapone) The bit of spice to the Gnocchi and the incredible smoked sear on the steak were delicious!  My only critique would be that it would have been nice if we were greeting at our table sooner than 5mins and explained some of the highlights of the menu. Someone did swing by quickly to get our drink order and when the serve finally arrived she simply asked what we'd like to order -no hello, my name is have you dined with us before, here are our specialties, etc. (I was a server for 15yrs on and off and always asked or explained certain aspects of the dining experience especoally in nicer establishments) We had to slow her down (the restaurant was not full by ANY means) and explain we had never been here and would like to know some recommendations, etc.   Overall it was a delicious experience and if you're looking for a fantastically flavored, romantic or special occasion meal I'd definitely recommend Mercato.   If you're on a budget or not wanting to pay an average of upwards of $50 per person though then this wouldn't be my go-to recommendation as Calgary is filled with deliciously affordable cuisine."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Nice wait staff. So so food.  When I was there the blonde chef was having a quiet meltdown/arguing with the waitresses and with the open kitchen seating, that was a little tense and awkward. She looked like she hated each dish and throw salt around/doused with olive oil. Not very refined looking cooking.   They used too much salt and olive oil in my octopus appetizer and it tasted like purple salt and olive oil.  The risotto was tasty but not healthy tasty, more super heavy cheese tasty which translated into a gut buster walk home.   I think there are prob better options for the price if you're after great food. The atmosphere however is very nice. I wouldn't go back- didn't leave me with a good \"taste.\""}
{"text":"The rib steak was so awesome. The steak is huge; It's meant for a group of people. We shared it between 5 people (with a few other dishes)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a pleasant dinner at Mercato the other night.  We found the staff to be accommodating, knowledgable, pleasant, and professional.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere was vibrant.  And the bill didn't send us into sticker-schock.  We arrived for our Thursday night reservation to find Mercato in full swing.  The place was packed and quite lively.  We asked to move to the kitchen counter as our table was quite low and close to dinners sitting on the counter.  Close proximity to strangers' butts, practically in our faces, is not our idea of a pleasant dining experience.  They moved us without question.  As it was our first time there, our waiter walked us through the menu and made suggestions without trying to oversell.  My GF and I shared a Caprese salad, an appetizer-size pasta, and a bifsteca Florantine with a side order of grill eggplant.  The water-buffalo mozzarella in the salad was amazing.  It's flown in regularly from Italy.  It's smooth and creamy, you think you're eating a cheese ice cream.  The pasta was delicious and just the right portion for us.  The linguini was loaded with clams and pancetta.  My only quibble is that they could've given us spoons to eat the pasta with.  Knife and fork just doesn't cut it.  No pun intended.  We ordered the smaller of the two steaks which turned out to be more than enough, as we were getting full at this point.  The dry-aged ribeye was grilled over an open flame and served simply with a little olive oil and sea salt.  It was lip-smacking good even though it was a tad over-cooked for medium rare.  I'd order it rare in the future.  With a couple of glasses of wine, the bill came to $120 before tip.  Not bad. Given the quality of the service, food, and  ambiance, it's surprising that we haven't eaten here sooner but we'll definitely be back before too long."}
{"text":"Yum is all I can say!  When it comes to carbs any italian restaurant is the place to be! Pasta and bread.. perfect!  I had their meatballs with foccaccio bread here during lilac festival and it was so delicious.  It was only $5 and you got 2 huge meatballs that were made up of a combination of pork and beef dripping and sitting in tomato sauce and then you were also served a piece of foccacio bread to eat the tomato sauce with.  It was delicious and amazing!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice but a little too noisy if you want to have a discussion with a group.  I was underwhelmed by the entire meal and experience. The food is average and hence over priced. My appetizer of charbroiled octopus shavings and grilled broccoli was decent. I decided to try a bowl of tagliatelle in a cherry tomato sauce with parmigiana topping. The pasta was a little over cooked and the sauce just did not hit  the mark. And the main reason is obviously the tomato selection. If the dish is going to rely on predominately tomatoes, then they better be top notch delicious. Instead there was almost no odor to it and an after taste that I can't quite describe. On the positive side, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Lunch at mercato is a flash back to Tuscany  Go with 3 friends, order a pasta, risotto and a meat dish (if your friends are linebackers or sumo more dish, if not these 3 will fill you all"}
{"text":"Nice place. Kinda trendy. The food was ok, but I have had better Italian food. The service was ok. I guess my overall impression was just Ok. Would go back if asked to, but would not go on my own."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with my 14 year old son last weekend for a boy's night out.  Went out for pizza but no pizza at Mercato.  We shared three appetizers and I had two glasses of wine - over $100 with tip.  Alot of money but the food was spectacular.    Service at the bar was excellent and all the staff were pleasant and hustling.  Crowd was a great mix of young couples, afterwork crowd and families with young children.    A great experience, if you can afford it."}
{"text":"The Best of the Best, one of my all time favs, I have my usuals starting with the caprese,bruschetta then the tagliatelle and finishing it with the main course of bistecca . After all that nothing is better than a cappuccino and tiramisu. Love it! Enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Its Friday at 5:30 pm and we walk into the 'empty' restaurant and ask for a table for two. Well, once the hostess organized herself and greeted us and looked at her screen and looked at her book she stated that the best she could do was two seats at a :gang style\" table. Give me a break - the place was empty.So , we went down the street and found another restaurant and on the way back 90 minutes later looked into Mercato and the the place was 1/4 empty. The owners must have made too much money already to have emptry seats. My advice...keep walking. This place has lost its way since the sons took over and moved to 4th Street - when they were located in Bridgeland the parents were very friendly and accomodating, I guess this is what they call progress. I have eaten here only once before - food was good but bring your wallet!!"}
{"text":"You could have a simple pasta dinner and spend very little... or you could go all out with multiple courses and get pretty expensive.  You can do share plates or you can order the smaller size and eat it all yourself!  For a group of us who hadn't been there before, we wanted to try everything and really experience it!  We spent $100 each, but got leftovers, and couldn't have been more satisfied at the end of the night.  There is a little market counter, so if you work downtown you can pop in and grab something easy for dinner on your way home."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in the service here on Sunday, July 10.  We sat on the patio and it took a while for the server to bring us menus and he wasn't overly attentive or friendly until it came time to pay the bill. We had the risotto, which was fabulous and the cannelloni - average and a little greasy.  My Pinot Grigio was excellent and I recommend it, if you don't mind the 16$ price tag.   Will return as I love this restaurant......one average experience hasn't changed that."}
{"text":"I had a lot of difficulty making a reservation and deciding what to order ahead of time as they do not have a menu online so I was a little reluctant to host my sisters birthday party here however, I had eaten here before so I knew a few dishes I wanted to order ahead of time. I came into this restaurant and was treated like a king. Our server was extremely polite and knowledgable with a friendly twist. Our food was spectacular. We were the last people in the restaurant and were never asked to leave as the servers actually seemed to enjoy our company and even brought my sister an amazingly tasty lemon cookie that was to die for. All in all if I were to live in Calgary I would be at this resto at least once a month. I can't wait to come back to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there was a place called \"the Italian Centre\" that existed in Bridgeland. And one day it moved far, far away, classed up and became the beautiful restaurant/grocery store called Mercato on Calgary's hip Beltline. It also had some of the best authentic, traditional Italian food outside of Italy, and certainly in Calgary.   So one day, old friends of the Italian Centre trekked down to Mercato to see how much it had changed. But behold, the insides were still the same! They were pleased to find that the grocery side was as well-stocked and delicious as always, the staff as friendly and laughing as always. And the new adjoining restaurant quickly became an addiction, a gourmet realization of all of their Italian hopes and dreams. It was full of light woods and an open kitchen, with tables scattered around the edges. And because Mercato had become so beautiful, it had new friends filling it almost every day of the week!  These old friends found that while the lunches were cheaper and delicious, dinner was where it was at! Just last night, they visited their new haunt once again. Delicious food was to be had all around. A \"small\" starter of Ahi Tuna Carpaccio was excellently prepared, light and delicious but flavorful with the addition of a light aioli and sea salt. Also amazing was the stuffed cuttlefish. Then came the pastas and risotto. The risotto was flavorful and filling, and surprisingly light. The gnocchi was covered in marscapone and a light lemon sauce, adding a refreshing spin to a dense dish. Throw in a dry prosecco, some excellent service and a lovely atmosphere for a night out, and it became the stuff of delicious history.  The story ends happily, as the old friends parted stuffed full of delicious food, and promising to come back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know why but Mercato reminds me so much of Vivo Ristorante in Edmonton. They could be brother restaurants. Same high end, expensive concept. Same family style dishes. Heck, even the menu design/layout looks identical.  Better make a reso if you want a spot here on Friday and the weekends. We came here Sunday evening and it was pretty packed.  The cool thing about Mercato is that they have their own market inside the restaurant. The layout inside is very cool as there's a couple different areas to sit at - the bar, tables, or right along the open kitchen. This seems to be a trend in Calgary, Pigeonhole is another spot that comes to mind.  The menu is split into four: antipasti, primi, second and contorni.  - Bread - Olives - Polpo ($23.00) - Gnocchi ($19.00) - Risotto ($23.00) - Bistecca ($97.00 double cut) - Asparagi ($16.00) - Broccoletti ($16.00) - Caffè latte - Panna cotta ($12.00)  Mercato knows what they're doing and it shows in the food. We rolled out of the restaurant fully satisfied but this is definitely one of those \"special\" occasion/splurge places. Happy to have tried it!"}
{"text":"I had the highest expectations when I took a couple friends from out of town to Mercato. I'd heard some great things. Some were right on...the entire feel of the place is lively and upscale. Both of my guests were satisfied though now wowed by their meals, but mine was a disaster. I had a Veal Chop that was easily tthe worst I have ever had...I would defy my pug to chew it...and what was worse, when I told my server about this he just left and came back with the comment that \"this is just the nature of the cut\"....excuse me!...Anyway, I was more than a tad put off. Despite this I will give them another chance because the atmosphere demands it."}
{"text":"I hate to say this buy our dinner last night wasn't as good as it used to be.   We've been going to Mercato for several years now and since it had been a while since we've gone we thought we'd give it a taste to make sure it was still our fave italian restaurant in Calgary.   We ordered the tagliatelle, bistecca, and green beans. Tagliatelle was fantastic, simple and delicious but could have used a little more bite - in other words a touch on the soft side. Sauce is beautiful and simple. Bistecca was medium and not the typical medium rare!!! We even mentioned it to our server and he didn't even offer to do anything about it or explained if it was supposed to be like that (even though we knew it isn't). We usually just end it there for our meal but thought we'd add some green beans. Never had them before and oh gosh tasted salty!! I had to wash my palate everytime I took a bite. Ok maybe a little exaggeration but it wasn't \"add salt to taste\" it was more like \"salt is the taste\"  Anyway, giving this a deserving 3 stars as we still did enjoy our time there watching the chefs, the server was nice just didn't handle the one situation well, and the overall flavors were wonderful! Some tweaks and they would have had 5 stars.  As for it being my fave Italian in Calgary....I dunno I'm willing to try other places, any suggestions??"}
{"text":"Just a hop skip and a jump from my home, Mercato Italian Gourmet. I have lunched here twice and in two different ways, first of all with a friend indoors and by myself outdoors. The two seating options have two different menus and prices.  Outside on the patio one can get an option of about 5 light lunch dishes all under $10.  This is a great place for me to write and I can get a lot of work done here, while watching the colourful 4th avenue populace walk by.  I believe I had a prosciutto sandwich, and a well brewed Italian coffee. My lunch was delicious and the service was impeccable but I had to resume it indoors because an umbrella caught wind and almost knocked over myself and my laptop.  Indoor seating is reminiscent of a very fancy New York diner with an open main kitchen with high stools surrounding the Chef action.  To give the Mission elite a chance to watch their Italian dishes prepared, garnished and served.  I always get a kick of watching the business women in their Prada and Gucci pencil skirts shimmy up the high stools.    The menu indoors is incredibly pricey but well worth it around 20 dollars and up for a main course.   I have also seen many patrons enjoying full bottles of wine at lunchtime.   I have had the mushroom appetizer as well as one of the main pasta dishes and they are presented in very large portions plus are accompanied by fresh focaccia bread complimentary with every meal.  The decor is very chic and expect the service to be top notch, the Italian delicatessen reminds me of the ones in Little Italy in Montreal.  Huge variety of meats and cheeses and everything from the best olive oils to the most decadent of deserts.  5 stars without a question, if you don't mind paying for such a privilege."}
{"text":"The white truffle pasta was pure heaven.  I have eaten at Mercato several times, and always had a wonderful meal.  Service can be hit or miss, but the food has always been great!  I miss this place now that I live in Houston.  The market is also great, and I still pick up olive oil every time I'm in Calgary"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times so far. All the food, sauces, ingredients, etc are prepared fresh and the chef, servers and all the staff clearly take a lot of pride in what they prepare.  They explained every item on the menu and history behind each food item, which was pretty impressive.  Tips: Ask them for food and wine advice. Book in advance if you want to get a proper seat. They have a beautiful patio outside. There is dedicated parking behind the restaurant, don't park in the street ! If the deli market next to the restaurant is open, be sure to take a look around !  If you are a big group: If you are not a big meat lover, or if you have small appetite, you should refuse their offer of \"a sharing plate\" for larger groups. You ending up paying a lot and eating food that gets cold before it gets to you."}
{"text":"This place is pricy but you have to give it a try if you are here in Calgary. Their steaks beat Caesar. Best steak in Calgary. Not bad. It was delicious and juicy for sure. Service was awesome.  The place is family style dishes. I also tried the tiramisu cake and wow its big portion.   Very good food here.   Service was wonderful. Funny how the server thought we forgot our takeout and went to the back to look for us but it was the wrong table he was looking for."}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple dined at Mercato recently. We have had several great experiences at this restaurant but this wasn't one of them. The food ( we shared the stuffed rabbit and risotto) was marginal at best! The noise level was atrocious. We won't  be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"When I said I was going to Mercato for the first time last week, the most common comment I got from people was, \"hope you like salty food!\" Or \"ask them to hold the salt, even then there will be too much of it.\" Salty food... got it... they weren't exaggerating. Mercato has the open kitchen concept down. And if you're sitting right at the bar, you can see the handful of salt going into each dish. It was especially apparent in the octopus appy we ordered. Although in my subsequent pasta order, I can't say it tasted too salty. It was actually quite tasty. But what was it? It's a week later and I can't remember. Pasta something... with meat... I know, helpful right? I tried to look on the website so I could repeat it for you, but alas, there's no menu posted there.  Best parts of Mercato: - The bread! Seriously, your own little piece to dunk in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Speaking of which, there are bottles of each every couple of seats. - The olives. A little bowl for your very own right next to the olive oil and vinegar. - The open kitchen. You can see EVERYTHING!  To improve upon: - Put your menu up on your website please Mercato. Many of my friends want to peruse a menu before we decide on a place to go and will pick a spot where they can get familiar with the menu items before hand (especially when they've got eating or dietary restrictions) - The salt really was excessive. I know a lot of this is personal taste, but when that was the number one comment I heard from folks, it turned up in a lot of the reviews I read AND it was my experience too? There might be something to that piece of feedback."}
{"text":"It's always difficult to get reservations at this restaurant so I was looking forward to coming back after a pleasant experience the first time.  It's small and boasts a market like atmosphere.  Depending where you sit, you can watch the chefs in action with the open kitchen.  We had to share a table with other people and the high chairs were quite uncomfortable.   Our friend vows to this place and quickly became on of their regulars so he took care of all the ordering.   We had this tomato pasta.  It tasted pretty plain but after a few bites, the flavors started to erupt.  I usually prefer a cream sauce but this tomato sauce was quite delicious.  It would be perfect if there were prawns or some sort of seafood in there because it was just simply pasta and tomatoes.   The one thing I didn't like about this place is that they use a lot of salt, seasalt.  I eat pretty salty but this is salt to the max so I was a little worried.  The wait time for the food is really slow.  By the time our main course came out, we didn't really have an appetite anymore.  We shared this platter of meats that included chicken, ribs, steak, lamb and sausages.  There wasn't any seasoning except seasalt on the side.  It wasn't salty at all this time; a lot of people must of complained or something.  I thought the meats were disappointing.  I much prefer my entrees marinaded with a burst of flavors.  I later found out that the platter costs almost 2 bills which I think was ridiculous.  The only thing I was looking forward to was the cheesecake but they ran out of it by the time we ordered.  Double disappointment.  I don't know why everyone loves this place but it's definitely not forte and I think you pay a lot for what you get.  The only thing that I'll be back is for their desserts."}
{"text":"Sadly, didn't live up to the hype.  I'm baffled by the fact that it's always full, and you can never seem to make reservations for normal dinner times  The pasta didn't taste like 'fresh, home-made' pasta   :( Menu was pricey Claims ' voted best steak in Calgary'.... nope me thinks not. Lamb was ok.  And the thing I hate the most....  everything was  wayyyyyyy over salted.... soooooo salty.... almost intolerably salty...  :(  Overrated.  Still on the hunt for good fresh pasta in Calgary..."}
{"text":"One of my fave restos in calg. Went there last night and due to a huge table, the kitchen was slowed down.. Our server Kristin came over to apologise and let us know what was going on, then the manager came over to apologise as well and offer a complimentary round of drinks as well as dessert for the wait. Love the mussels and the steak platter."}
{"text":"It's my first time at Mercato, we reserved a table for 2 but when arrived they told us that our table is not ready and we will have to wait, after 15 min wait she came back to say that there is 2 chairs available at the chef table, we declined the chairs and asked for a table, we waited extra 10 minutes and we didn't get the apology that we think we deserve. The place is nice but very loud. Food is great and the portions are right, pasta comes in half portions as well which is so convenient if you would like to try more than a plate."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant serving fresh ingredients.  Virtually everything was homemade. This is family-style Italian, so none of the portions is supposedly made for one.  Perhaps I'm a big eater, but the full portion of the pasta, while a generous portion, wasn't too much for one.  As a vegetarian, I was somewhat limited in my selections, but I didn't feel remotely deprived.  We shared a bruschetta (incredible) and a caprese salad as appetizers.  We got full orders of the tagliatelle and the pistachio pesto for our entrees.  The tagliatelle is their signature item, or so I'm told, and it's quite good, but I preferred the pesto, which was simply out-of-this-world.  It's not what I would call robust in flavor, but rather a more delicate and subtle taste to the freshly pressed pasta creations.  None of the sauces are pre-made, if I understood correctly, but rather prepared as one orders.  A neighboring diner offered us some of the side order of mushrooms, which were also delicious.  I asked our server to recommend a glass of wine with the meal -- the Planeta Cerasuolo di Vittoria -- and it was perfect.  The downsides:  First, this place has Nazi-like time restrictions.  If one enters at 9:01p on a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, she will not be served (I believe the last seating is at 9:30p on Wednesday, and 10 or 10:30p on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday . . .  the hours listed on Yelp are wrong).  I came here three times -- the first two times just slightly after 9p (as in 9:05p), and was sent away.  Third time's a charm, but I arrived at 8:20p, knowning the likely outcome if I pressed my luck.  Persistence pays.  It was worth the wait.  Also, it's loud.  So loud you can barely hear yourself.  It cuts both ways.  Mercato always seems to be rockin' and busy.  It's a wonderful venue for a celebration or festivity.  But it is loud.  Finally, it's not cheap.  For two people, the tab (with tip) was $150, and we ate vegetarian.  If we ordered the steak or the fritto misto, I would expect the bill easily to top $200.  Deceptively, it has the feel of an everyday place, but it has the prices of a special occasion.  Everyone is friendly and the it's a definite winner.  Recommended for the local or the tourist to Calgary."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this place.  I've enjoyed some fantstic meals (oh Chef Benito of the Trattoria near the Stampede Casino... where are you...)   But when I got there, I've found the food, while above average, just wasn't on the scale that everyone is raving about.  Worse, I was shocked by how pricey it was, with a menu much like La Cheval de Coeur in Montreal where every little side dish and so on was extra.  Boiled down, this makes the average bill per person for a full meal easily in the $70+ range.  I've enjoyed dinner at Teatro, another outstanding Italian resto, for less than that and a far better atmosphere.  Sorry Mercato.   I wanted to like you, but I can't.  I do find the market kinda cool though but also fairly overpriced.  Sorry, it's Lina's for me.  Quality just as good and way more reasonable."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Calgary for the last few years, based on price, quality, quantity and atmosphere.  I really don't need to write an essay to say how good this restaurant is, you just have to trust me."}
{"text":"Good service and good wine!!.. However, I was a little disappointed with the food... It was just ok... Nothing outstanding... The scallops on my risotto were a little burned for my taste and the carpaccio had a little more salt than I would like... Next time I will like italian food in Calgary, I think I will go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"It was so busy there, even though we walked in at 530pm, which is when they open.  We snagged a table because there just so happened to be a last minute cancellation, otherwise we would have had to sit at the bar.  I hate sitting at bars, because it's hard to have actual conversation, and plus i'm short, so getting up and down on the stools is quite a pain.  We quickly ordered because I was hungry.  We ordered a mushroom pasta, octopus pasta, the bistecca with a side of mixed mushrooms.  The pastas were great!  Even though pastas tend to me heavy, both these pastas were light and flavourful.  I guess its because it was a oil based sauce instead of a heavy cream or tomato sauce.   From both these pastas, the octopus was my favourite.  Very tender!   The main was the steak.  It took FOREVER to come.  I know people like to sit and chat and enjoy their meals slowly.  But I was hungry, borderline getting to be HANGRY.  I just wanted my steak damn it.  We kept asking them how much longer, and they kept saying soon, it's just resting etc.  It finally arrived, and unfortunately I don't think it was worth waiting for.  I find the steaks I have in Toronto are much better.  There just wasn't much flavour.  Alberta is known for their beef, but yet, the beef I've had in Alberta, is well just meh.  Do they ship out all their beef to other parts of Canada instead?  The pasta was good, so good I would come back just for the pasta if i'm in Calgary again.  And I will make sure to make reservations next time, because I definitely don't want to sit at bar."}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals since I moved to Calgary a year ago.  Mercato is serving up traditional Italian fare, prepared extremely well.  If you decide to go, I strongly recommend going family style.  There are lots of great items on the menu, and they are more than willing to allow you to share.    The menu is set up to be eaten in three courses.  First is your antipasto, second is a pasta dish, and third is a protein.  We started with the clams, which were cooked beautifully and served with fresh greenery to make it like a light salad.  Next we had a risotto, which has surprisingly light and fresh.  Last we had the halibut, which was cooked to perfection (which seems to be a rarity in Calgary).  The service was extremely competent.  The allowed us to take our time and slowly enjoy are food and wine.  We had a great dining experience.  I would strongly recommend that people check it out again if they had a bad first experience."}
{"text":"A fantastic Italian cafe with an open kitchen headed up by Spencer who has been the head chef since opening. The pastas are wonderful and can be ordered as a starter and shared family style. The grilled and rolled fresh sardines are special/ 3 of us shared a huge 42 ounce rib steak with green beans and mushrooms. To die for."}
{"text":"Up in Calgary great Italian food is hard to come by but this place does it right. Exceptional and unique menu with a very friendly staff. This place has been busy every time I've gone, even during the week which is a always a good sign. Had an amazing swordfish dish. I've gone without a reservation and they easily accommodated.   Great wine and homemade dessert selection too! A++++"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's really hit or miss with Italian restaurants.  Luckily, Mercato is a hit!  They've got great food, and a wonderful selection.  Being an Italian place they should know what good pasta tastes like.  They serve up traditional dishes with their own little quirks to them.  And you've got to love the classic bread and oil they serve!  That's probably one of my favourite thing about Italian restaurants.  Mmm!  I also really enjoy the interior design of this place.  It's pretty different from most other restaurants in that you're almost expected to interact with the kitchen staff.  See, there's a large counter that you can sit at and watch the chefs work.  It's pretty neat... but a little noisy.  I also think it's pretty cool that they are a market as well as a restaurant.  It's nice because all the ingredients used in their menu items are fresh from their adjoining market.  Mercato really is fine Italian cuisine, highly recommended by me!"}
{"text":"Open kitchen concept with a market on the far side. Everything I've ordered here has been amazing. Came here with my boyfriend without a reservation on valentines day not long before closing. Had exceptional service from wine/beer recommendations to a fast and collective attitude overall. The carpaccio, vongole and asparagi had great flavours. I decided to get the gnocchi as I've had it many places and it's just not as good as the real thing in Italy. In high hopes since everything was going well I got it and it was also amazing. Really put a great end to the night. Very nice place will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant for lunch in the summer.  I love sitting in their patio, taking in the sounds and sights of fourth street.    My favorite dish is their tasty Zuppa di Pesce.  In fact, they have a picture of this dish on their website.    A word of warning, their serving of pasta is ginormous. [well at least for me]  So if you're planning to have a pasta course in between your antipasto and main, be mindful of the generous serving.  When I think of summer, I think of Mercato. [I know it sounds weird.]"}
{"text":"Love it!!   Love the italian market beside it! and love the restaurant, yes I agreed with other people, it's a bit overpriced, but I highly recommend the \"Bistecca\", so good! juicy beef meat, perfect blend with the sea salt, baby argula and lemon, portion is big, good for 2 person, or 3 small eater!s!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's lively, you get to watch the kitchen, and the food is fantastic.  The owners are friendly, and the several times I've been here the serving staff has been great.  Great wine choices, with staff that have great recommendations for pairing.   Once I came, and my reservation wasn't quite ready, so they bought us our appetizer and then we drank Grappa with the owner.  I love it here and always recommend it to people."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this restaurant for dinner after hearing some rave reviews from friends who had come here for lunch.  You are greeted by a market when you first come in that offers many Italian specialty items and some that you can pick up at the Safeway down the street.  Prices are not for the tightwad, I guess being in the core you should be prepared to spend a little more, having said that Scarpones and Lina's offers pretty much the same stuff at more reasonable prices.  The menu itself is not extensive but the dishes offered are very well executed.  I had the halibut and hubby had the rib-eye.  Sides are not included and must be ordered separately, we had the mushrooms and green beans.  They were good but on the pricey side but they come family style so the portions are generous.  The halibut was huge and had a wonderful crispy crust with a moist, juicy centre.  Done perfectly and topped with grilled lemon, YUM!  The rib-eye was grilled to perfection and I loved the fact that they pre-cut it for you right before it was served.  Meaty, chunky beef on a plate with just the simplest of ingredients to bring out the natural flavour, salt, pepper and brushed with a bit of olive oil.  You need a really good steak in order to do this!  Mercato is not a fancy formal restaurant, really casual and cool feel to the place.  Your meal is essentially cooked in front of you and you can see when your order is actually being plated, so the waiter can't lie and say \"your meal is on its way out\" here.    Finished with a fancy coffee, I basically asked the waiter to surprise me and he did.  I thought it was delicious because there obviously was some hazelnutty booze lurking in the background, but it was warm, delicious and came with a mini biscotti which I thought was nice.    Overall a really nice place that has a cool vibe located in the core.  A bit pricey so don't expect to leave here dropping less than $100 for 2 (booze not included!) Would have given it a 5 stars but service was just ok, and it is very loud in there, also with the market inside, you get quite a few people popping in to shop."}
{"text":"It's the best meal we had during our trip to Canadian Rockies. Every thing we ordered is great (caprese salad, risotto, pasta, steak, desserts). The steak is very well made and tastes like heaven. The food is mostly authentic Italian style with some interesting twists. Definitely will return and try their other dishes next time I visit."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this place is spendy. But you definitely get what you pay for. Wine selection fantastic meal preparation fantastic. For lunch this can be loud for business but for romance this place is amazing located in Mission this restaurant is ideally suited for people looking for a fantastic authentic Italian meal paired with an amazing wine highly recommend."}
{"text":"People in the neighbourhood were absolutely raving about Mercato, but after about five visits there I am still struggling to understand - why?  Open kitchen is a great idea, agreed. Maybe not so entertaining when chef & co are tired and busy, but still not bad.  Lots of people around give the place that cute \"Italian\" feeling like everyone around is yelling, and there is no space left, and someones underwear is hanging on the cables across the street right over your head...  Food is an \"american-Italian\" variety. Decent quality, but overly expensive for those diminutive portions. Wine list is ok - but just ok, I can't remember anything special about it, sorry.  Not friendly for the casual drop-ins - you absolutely *have* to book a place before you go. Publicity, sir.  Overall? Not bad, overpriced, leaving you hungry... and rather faceless. Like, there is nothing special to remember about it. Maybe inadvertent compensation for that is the reason for all those ravings I've heard?"}
{"text":"Incredible, as good as any spot in Italy!! Been there for lunch and dinner, can't wait to work my way through their whole menu"}
