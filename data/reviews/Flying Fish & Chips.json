{"text":"Exactly what's expected of Fish n Chips. Greasy, crispy goodness and lots of it."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I've eaten so far! Better than pajo's and without the line up. The price is very fair and they have daily specials too. Kudos to the owner(s), they have a very delicious batter recipe and price point."}
{"text":"Excellent fish 'n chips. Though this dish is commonly expected to be greasy, its not the \"greasy\" greasy type. Nice and fresh, without any stale, oily residue that's so common with most fish and chip places.  Very crispy, and the fish is flaky and light. Again, I cannot stress enough how \"not\" greasy it is. Nice and lightly fried, but certainly not the greasy, bitter aftertaste that's been known to be expected at many corner fish n chips shops."}
{"text":"I really liked it and the portions were big.  It was a british style fish and chips. They also have Halal meat there."}
{"text":"Hey fellas (and all) just an FYI...
The guy that opened this place..opened Stanleys in Brooklin
The master batter, err I mean a master at batter and knowing how to serve it at its best!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best fish & chips in Whitby and Oshawa!  Simple place, great food, big portions!"}
{"text":"Decided to punish my arteries tonight and dropped in for some battered death..LOL.

Definately a good size portion with a nice batter and the fries were pretty good..my only issue would be the price of $40 for 4 pieces of haddock with two fries.

I have to wonder how any of the fish and chips shops stay in business if fish and chips is getting this expensive."}
{"text":"After driving by this place every single day since I've lived in Whitby, we finally decided to give it a shot. We headed down on a cold snowy night to pick up some fish and chips for dinner. We usually head to a different fish and chip joint but I wanted to try this one out.

One of the stand out things about this place is the menu. Not only do they have standard fish and chips, but they have a TON of other stuff, including Caribbean cuisine. And the menu for the sit down restaurant is slightly different than that of takeout. You have a few more appetizer options (like deep fried pickles, which sounded so good).

Anyways, we ordered a 1 or 2 piece fish combo with coleslaw each and I added an order of clam strips as well. First thing, a lot of food. We had quite a bit each, I think we managed to stretch it into another meal entirely. However, the fish itself didn't stand up to the other fish place we go to. The fries here were better, but I can't quite put my finger on what about the fish I didn't like. The clam strips were quite good, as expected.

Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be returning. Our other fish joint really has it down and the price is slightly cheaper. I would like to try some of the Caribbean cuisine they offer though."}
