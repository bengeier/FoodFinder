{"text":"I love the service at this restaurant.  I am a lunch regular and their customer service is the best I've experienced on a consistent basis.  Good food and quick."}
{"text":"The pad Thai had no flavor. The house special rice was tasty but only with few shrimps and bits of beef."}
{"text":"Tom Yum soup is really good. Then we tried the corn soup and it was so so. Chilly chicken was yum but tasted some pork in it. Not sure. When we did take out the soup containers were broken, they must have poured the hot soup. I think they are new so they are figuring things out. The mushroom rice, egg fried rice was really tasty. The prices are great. You spend half the amount you spend elsewhere and the ambience is comfortable. If you have not tried this place you are missing something..it is definately worth a visit. We tried the roti and it was ok though. Restauran malasia has better roti."}
{"text":"Had their Yong Chow fried rice, Soft Crab fried rice and Malaysian Laksa for take-out. Food as well as portions are good. The rice is not greasy and there's a good amount of soft-shell crab. The laksa is not an authentic Malaysian laksa but it tastes good with strong flavours of dried shrimp and lemongrass. Service is friendly. Will go back."}
{"text":"Horrible food. When we asked how much the portions were the waiter advised that us that the dish we were about to order was sufficient for the both of us. We proceeded to order it and it was way too much. They are just trying to make as much money out of you, because they know you will not return for that horrid food again. Additionally the drinks are way too small for the prices they are charging. I would suggest avoiding this place all together."}
{"text":"Ordered combo for 2 ($20.99) comes with Chinese soup but rice is not included. Dishes are very small for the price. Can't compete with other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant, hands down is one of the worst experience I had in my life. Of course, that is a bold statement to make; and I will explain. First we were greeted by a very rude old asian man in the counter. He was very rude and offensive. As you can tell from my profile or my last name, my family is not from the Asian origins. I overheard him talking to one of the servers some very harsh racist remarks. The food was quite satisfying, but the meat in the chilli chicken and sweet and sour chicken felt very old and processed. Our bill came to 25.05 after 2 dishes and a drink. I handed 30 dollars for the bill. I was expecting to receive my 4.95 dollars, but they informed me that they will not give me back my money, as they say it was service charge. I previously informed my lawyer about this, but he chose that it was not worth the effort to go to court. These people are scammers, stay away from this restaurant. They advertise no MSG, but i would not trust these scammers."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese restaurant I've ever experienced. I asked for steamed vegetables and they gave me steamed head lettuce."}
{"text":"The food is edible, but that's not saying a lot.  The quality of the noodles in the noodle soup are very low grade.  Seems catered to non-asians.  Food is not as good as from Congee Queen."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some food for lunch because there wasn't much choice around the area. The place is clean, however food quality and service is lacking. They gave us tea when we sat down, the cups were oily and you can tell oil was floating on the top as well. Told them to change it and still the same. We ordered the lunch special which comes with either a free hot drink or spring roll. When we were ordering the waiter had to make us repeat 3-4 times and still got it wrong. Should probably use a pen and paper. The food portion is good, but I wouldn't say the food is great. 25mins in, we finished all our food they forgot about our drinks and spring rolls. Had to remind them a couple of times. Finally came and both the hot drink was not hot and spring roll was frozen cold. Don't recommend people to come here unless there's no other places open in the area."}
{"text":"First and last time to this restaurant. I was getting a take out lunch, the middle age Chinese guy at the cashier counter gave the worst service ever! The food is very greasy and salty, and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the few chinese restaurants that DONT use MSG and actually mean it! Even without the MSG their food is better than other restaurants that have to succumb to it!   Prices are amazing for no MSG you don't even have to pay extra, their prices are on par or cheaper than other places. PLUS the portion are A LOT larger than those at other chinese restaurants.   Must try if you're in the area and want chinese food that tastes a great deal, tastes great and have no MSG!"}
{"text":"NO MSG is what's advertised. I can't confirm if this is true, but if true I like this place already.  This restaurant fills the need for a Chinese restaurant this far north from Hwy 7. We ordered 2 items from their Sunday lunch special (lemongrass pork chop rice and beef brisket rice noodle soup). The food was decent, no real complaints, the spring rolls were small but quite tasty and were fried fresh!  The interior decor is hit or miss. The seating and general atmosphere is quite nice, but the TV's and car posters I feel detract from the overall look giving it a bit of a low-end diner feel. The bar itself reminds me of a swimming pool.  I remember seeing a sign on the side Elgin Mills Rd earlier during the summer which said \"Dim Sum\". I did not see any dim sum on their menu.  The staff seemed friendly enough for our first time there. Possible repeat in the future due to convenience since I live in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is presented well, tastes fantastic, and comes out quickly. Service is also great. The waiter was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"The food was ok, too much garlic and onion.. Hence the name. Wasn't able to catch that blast of flavour I was hoping for, since there were tons of garlic in my dish. I was surprised the garlic wasn't strong.. Surprised and sad at the same time.. I love garlic and not even that delivered.   The second time I went was for afternoon tea. I ordered spaghetti with a cream sauce to go with it. I URGE all curious individuals to not explore this place any further because it sucked so HARD. The sauce wasn't even sauce.. It was friggin white water.. I was able to see the separation of cream and water.. Just bad! When my milk tea came, it further supported my \"sucked HARD\" statement.. B/c that's how HARD it sucked. There was no taste to the milk tea, just the sugar I put in. I don't know if it was just try luck, but two times with similar experience really doesn't help in changing my perspective.  Food sucked, drink sucked.. But the boss man was very friendly. That deserves a full 1 star in my book. He wasn't spectacular, but still really good. Happy greeting when I arrived, took my order politely and always checking up on us to see if we needed anything.   .5 star for the food and an extra star for a cool boss (the chubby man), so this would be a freakin 1.5 star in total.. What a shame.. It's in a good location too. :("}
{"text":"The Garlic Onion is our \"go to\" Chinese food restaurant. The food is great, not too greasy but just enough! They have a great variety of dishes on the menu, ranging from the staples (like sweet and sour pork, my favourite!) as well as some originals. We call and pickup but they are always friendly and polite on the phone as well as when you go in. They also give a discount if you pay in cash, always great! Plus the food never takes more than 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"I came by Saturday for lunch. I wasn't disappointed at all.  Price- around $8 meal including a drink ( coffee, tea or soy milk) and vegetarian spring rolls.   Decor - it's very comfortable in here. It's clean. They have a couple TVs as well.   Food - the food is 4 stars. They have a wide selection of Chinese food. Reminds me of restaurants in Hong Kong. A little bit of everything.   Service - they deserve 6 stars. Very few Chinese restaurants offer such good service.  They're attentive, flexible and nice."}
{"text":"Went in for the chili chicken lunch special. Nothing special about it. It was very bland. I was very disappointed. I didn't bother finishing what I ordered"}
{"text":"If you're looking for quantity, this will probably hit the mark. If you're looking for good customer service, ask for Vincent or his mom (family business). I have only visited this place twice and both times by myself, so I cannot comment on all the dishes they have on their menu. This review will be short and will focus on their \"Malaysian Laksa\".  It's not Penang Laksa and it's not Singapore Laksa. It might be another kind of Malaysian Laksa I do not know of, but I do know they do not have a Malaysian chef (because I asked). Large portion but wasn't what I expected so I would go to other Laksa places next time."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food! Chilli chicken and crispy beef, wow!!!   Will continue to order from this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day because it was nearby. First impression of the lunch menu was that it was more expensive than average. A lunch meal is over $10 with either a drink or two veggie spring rolls.  They have a good variety in their menu. My dad ordered the Laksa. As expected, it did not have the authentic flavours. My dad said it had no coconut flavour. Also his bowl came with one tiny shrimp.  I had the grilled chicken dan dan mien. The chicken was nice. The soup base once again lacked flavour, the noodles quite soggy."}
{"text":"Their food is tasty despite no msg ! However their quantity is tiny for the price :( I will return for the lunch special which is more reasonable"}
{"text":"Ate here with the entire famjam last night. Everything was tasty and each dish flavoured well. The portions were quite large but they were not exactly cheap. Although the menu is quite large, you will be hard pressed to find any desirable main for under $15 (and the seafood runs even higher). This for me dropped it from a 4/3.5*."}
{"text":"Tried this place TWICE, and it sucked both times. Both times were for take out.   First the wait was extremely LONG. 30 minutes wait for take out? Seriously?  Then the taste. We have tried the following and they were all tasteless and gross:  Lemon Grass Pork Chops Chicken Pad Thai Blackbean Beef  Wonton Soup (they use instant noodles) General Tao Chicken  The fried rice upgrade was just egg fried rice and was extremely greasy.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Quite expensive compared to other Chinese / Vietnamese / Malaysian restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a Stir Fried Flat Noodle ($8.50) with Beef and a Shanghai Wonton Soup Noodle ($5.99) from the lunch menu.  The Stir Fried Flat Noodle with Beef looked and tasted decent.  The portion was good enough for 2 people who were not super hungry.  There was enough beef slices as well.  The Shanghai Wonton Soup Noodle tasted decent, too.  It was a bit expensive for the ingredients and the portion.  For the same price, I prefer the Cantonese style Shrimp Wonton Soup Noodle.  In reality the Cantonese Shrimp Wonton Soup Noodle often sells for less.  Garlic Onion can remedy this by upping the portion.  Garlic Onion is not bad for lunch, especially there isn't much competition around this area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! The food is always fresh and the staff could not be kinder! I always feel like a member of the family when I go there! Definitely recommend the eggplant hot plate, salt and pepper squid and... well everything is amazing so go spoil your tastebuds! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Excellent food...I was here with my family and kids , had Mongolian fried rice and some other dishes .., tasted really good... have to mention specially about their service, constantly friendly even with all the confusion we made with the kids menu.. great authentic food to try !!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Vincent, our server, treated us so well and accommodated our requests for veggie options. Service was great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be a decent place for some cheap chinese food. Not anymore. The last time I ordered their fried chicken, there was not ONE piece of meat in it, and nothing but fried dough on chicken skin. I left with such a disgusting taste in my mouth, never again."}
{"text":"Ironically, this place is called \"Garlic Onion\", but there wasn't a trace of Garlic, Onion or any flavor in the food for that matter!  Overall,  not a pleasant experience.  Highlights: - None of the 4 dishes ordered by our family of 4 had any flavor in it whatsoever - All patrons were chinese, which makes made think it may be more catered to a traditional Chinese audience - General cleanliness of the restaurant wasn't that great.  One of our plates had some caked on food stuck to it. - Similar to the comment of another reviewer, the staff had trouble speaking English as it was a bit hard to understand what they were trying to say  Price was ok though, but I guess you get what you pay for.  The bill came to $55 for 4 people,  including 3 Perrier's.   The only other real positive was that they advertise No MSG.  It was worth a try as no one in our party had been here, but I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"been here plenty times for the beef soup amazing  tasty and all freshly made to order.. prices are fantastic ..very nice newly renovated and cozy great atmosphere and a loving family working together makes you feel at home with your own family. The dad has a sense of humor the son is very polite . They will come check up make sure everything is good not once did I have to ask for anything they always had everything ready for you .. running out of water? he's always there for refill before you're even done the glass. I give this place a aaa+ and anyone who hasn't been here needs to visit and taste there delicious food"}
{"text":"The staff here are consistently friendly! The food is has no MSG, which is one of their specialties.  It's honestly not greasy, and every plate I've had here by far is excellent.  Would definitely come back often!"}
{"text":"First of all I respect that I am at an ethnic restaurant and I am Chinese myself. But it  always bothers me though when staff cannot speak English. This is Canada and I find it unacceptable.   Eating here on a Friday evening during prime time. Not even half full. Dishes came out at a excruciatingly slow pace. 20 minutes before spicy wontons appetizers. Another 10 before the soup, another 10 minutes before the main dishes arrived.  What kind of chinese restaurant is this?  Either they were understaffed in the kitchen or suffering some sort of delay...regardless I'd be embarrassed to be running such a restaurant with such slowness.  Food in general was pretty average, with pricing higher than what you'd expect.  My general advice, with plenty of options a 10 minute drive away on highway 7, either cook at home or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although price-wise it's not a cheap restaurant, the food quality and amazing service are more than enough to make up for the price. I visit the place at least once a week and since they're open several years ago I have yet to be dissapointed by them. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"2.5 star   Garlic Onion is trying too too hard... Trying to serve every Asian Cuisines: Cantonese, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Malaysian under 1 roof...ended up nothing really stand out to be exceptional! and some can be downright embrassing!  Lunch Specials are quite good value from $6.99 that includes a drink. The selections are quite extensive!   Noodle with Peanut Sauce in Soup ($6.99)  - The broth is quite flavoured with good kick of spiciness  - noodle though are store brought ones... overcooked and soggy without any bite at all   Home Style Vermicelli with Chicken and Shrimp ($10.99) with 2 spring rolls  - a huge disappointment for value/taste/presentation  - the vermicelli is the really really thin one... and they just tasted undercooked and dried  - not much flavour, dare I say tasteless??   The services though is friendly and efficient. Tons of booth seatings and the chairs are heavily padded!   Garlic Onion really needs to trimmed down their offerings and work on making their dishes better tasting.   They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Went on sat night not many people in restaurant but we got treated superbly.  Food was delicious had ginger beef Shanghai noodle and tai chicken.  Great find and will definitely  go back."}
