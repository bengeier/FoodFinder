{"text":"If you like waterlogged pasta, runny sauce and food that really is not that good, by all means eat here.    Water is cold, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Ok, this place isn't great, it isn't horrible. Stuffed eggplant appetizer was good. Chicken Marsala sauce was a tad greasy and a little thicker than I like but ok. Now...why two stars? Folks, if you offer a Yelp check-in discount either honor it or remove it from the page. Period. It clearly states the offer is good for one table only and there was no disclaimer for large parties, which we had. That said, if you are going to ring us all up on one table number then honor the discount code. It's your language, not mine. Don't send some server to the table with some B.S. excuse as to how it wasn't meant for large parties and that she \"wasn't even sure why that was still on the page\" because they don't do that anymore. Ridiculous. Get it together, clearly state the language or take it down. However, I won't be back so it's really irrelevant."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely awful meal, and I took 5 others with me.  I had scallops  $18 and it was a very small portion, the scallops were small, the size of a nickel, tough and fishy tasting. The sauce didn't have any flavor, the bread was below average.  Maybe they just had a bad night, I was never there before, but they have been around a very long time.  All I know is if someone gave me a giftcard from there, I would give or throw it away.Very overpriced for the offerings."}
{"text":"Ate here for Mother's  Day. We had a reservation  and I'm  glad. Those without  one had to wait for  a while  to get a table. The food was good but it took about an hour and 20 minutes for us to eat. 2 sdults and a child. We only  ordered dinner and dessert ,  no appetizers . The service was slow. The staff were extremely  polite and attentive. There were a lot of large parties being that it was a holiday, however I feel like the cook needed more help.  Heads up, this is not a place to go for ambiance. There is literally  nothing on the walls other than paint. Though the food was good and we'll  go back, the plating was nothing special and quite plain."}
{"text":"Really not a fan. My pasta with chicken tasted like cardboard. The inside is super run down and depressing. The service was fine, I'll give them that. Nice employees. Just nothing happening there to inspire me to return."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here tonight. We live very close and have yet to ever go. What a mistake. When you first walk in, you are assaulted with pastel palette and an over abundance of mauve. This is more 80's than my grandmothers house. I could ignore the decor if the service was better. It was horrible. Our waitress came twice then disappeared.  Apparently she went home sick and no one else came to pick up our table for over 20 min. Smooth. So when we finally got our food, I was really hoping for greatness. I don't know why I was expecting good food when everything else wasn't.  I ordered veal with peppers.  17.99. I got less than a third of a pepper on my plate with 3 tiny, extremely thin, tough pieces of veal. It was supposed to be served with a brandy sherry sauce. Nope. It was a white wine butter sauce. The description also didn't mention the veal was scallopine. It was. Probably could of given myself a paper cut with these. The experience was awful, the service was horrendous, the decor cannot be unseen, and everything was a good 5 to 7 dollars over priced. Will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise.  We stopped at Calabria's after an early wedding and dined on the patio.  I had the veal and peppers as main course and it was outstanding.  We had the following apps and all were delicious: greens & beans, stuffed bread sticks, fried zucchini, sautéed sausage all of them tasted like more.    I highly recommend Calabria's it's right up there with Franco's and Mia Madre's as great Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pittsburgh Steak Salad and LOVED IT. My client had the Italian Sandwich w/fries and said it was really good too. So, about my steak salad..well done slices over a ample amount of greens, mozzarella cheese, thin carrot slivers, black olives, cucumbers AND french fries..I kinda, sorta drenched it in Ranch dressing. Mmmmmm!!! Yea, the place is outdated on the inside, but the food makes it all worth the visit. My waiter was friendly, as well as the other staff. Will definitely be coming here again! Sorry, no pictures. I forgot lol. Oh, and ample amount of parking. That's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a friend. We both ordered the grilled salmon. It came with soup or salad and choice of potato, rice, vegetable or pasta. A choice of potato or vegetable was kind of disappointing. Usually you get 2 sides & a protein, especially when your meal is $18.99... the salmon was cooked perfectly & we both chose a baked potato. The potato was a nice size & also baked perfectly through. Our service was average, although her perfume was strong & off putting. Being a server myself, it's a known rule of thumb in the industry that you never wear perfume. Just because you like it doesn't mean your guests will. The restaurant itself was rather plain, nothing on the walls but a few lamps. It was really open with booths lining the walls and tables in the center. It lacked privacy. I had heard it was recently remodeled. Seems like they must have been on a tight budget. It was almost awkward, how open it was.  Over all, the experience was average & I doubt I will return. We both agreed we wouldn't go our of our way to go back. There are just too many choices in the surrounding areas to go back to something so under thrilling."}
{"text":"I went with me and two of my friends and we waited about 10 minute before anyone offered to order our drinks. I was very upset but after they realized that we had been forgotten they more than made up for it! They gave us great food and even offered us free dessert for being patient! The staff was so friendly and they always had a smile on their faces. I would definitely recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"2 hours to receive cold food, which was subsequently heated in the microwave to over cooked.  None of our meals were served together and the manager argued with us when we raised the service issues!  The owner finally did the right thing and adjusted our bill.  Not happy with any aspect of our visit. Disappointed since this was a family dinner with out of town relatives we rarely see who were in to see an I'll relative."}
{"text":"Saying Calabria's is up there with Franco's and Mia Madre is a stretch. However, Calabria's is vey good for what it is- casual italian foods. I would say it's closer to Armstrong's or Little Oasis. I stopped here for dinner with a friend at 8pm on a Saturday night. We asked to sit outside but were informed that the patio was \"rented\" out for the night for a party. When I walked into the dining room, I was immediately frightened and seriously considered going elsewhere. It looked like they clean with pepto bismal. Everything is a very ugly pink color. Tables, booths, chairs, decorations- pepto bismal pink. We were also the youngest patrons by about 20 years. Stomaches growling, we decided to stay and were very glad we did. I ordered the grilled chicken with a side of pasta with vodka sauce. The entrees also came with a salad or soup. I chose the salad with cheesy garlic dressing. Yes, the dressing is called cheesy garlic. It was a creamy, cheesy italian dressing. Delicious. I can definitely see using this dressing as a sauce for subs and chicken. The salads were also served with italian bread with a oil, balsamic and spices dip. Perfect compliment to my meal. Our entrees arrived quickly. I was very pleased with my choice. The chicken was juicy and tender with good flavors. The penne with vodka sauce was delicious. A wonderful combination of tomatoes and cream. When I asked for parmesan cheese, I was directed to the bottle of shaker cheese on the table. Not quite what I was looking for. Our waitress quickly brought me a small cup of grated cheese. Throughout the night the service was exceptional. Now, that might have to do with the fact that there were only 2 other tables at that time but regardless, it was great. I decided to save a piece of chicken for lunch the next day and get dessert. We were looking for chocolate cake but the closest thing we found was a chocolate brownie ala mode. Other than the decor, dessert was the reason Calabria's got 4 stars instead of 5. The brownie was on the hard and thin side. Overall, I would definitely head back to Calabria's for dinner but will pass on dessert."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with, a side of vinegar, surprised they didn't charge us for the extra napkins. Service was terrible to boot. Never will go back. You'd have better service and food at Olive Garden...and that's hard for me to say."}
{"text":"Went here today for a wedding and it was really nice. The service was nice and attentive. The coffee was decent and the lemonade was pretty tasty too.   For a meal we had a salad with house Italian dressing which was very good. The mixed vegetables were steamed, could've used some seasoning and were frozen I believe. The potato dish was like a peeled baked potato that was sliced every quarter inch widthwise and had some sort of seasoning on top. It was ok, but I really just wanted sour cream, cheese, and bacon on top of it. Then, there was a tenderized breaded chicken dish that was pretty good. Lastly, but my favorite as well, was their eggplant Parmesan with red sauce. I believe it was homemade, but I'm not positive. Regardless, it was very good!"}
{"text":"My dinner was plentiful and delicious. Enjoyed the cannoli for dessert. Nice decor! Clean too. Very happy"}
{"text":"We got takeout this evening and it was good! The portions are nice and we always have extra for the next day. The cannoli was delicious."}
{"text":"We had reservations and still had to wait an hour to be seated. Waited an hour our food. We were told several times the kitchen was backed up. Not our problem. We'll never go back. We ordered chicken and that was all we had on our plate. Just chicken no pasta??????"}
{"text":"We were there last night with a party of 6. Through an error on our part, we did not make a reservation, as we had planned. One member of our party is 92 and has a hard time waiting. Even though the lack of reservations was our fault, the owner and staff could not have been any nicer or more hospitable. They explained we would likely wait between 15-40 minutes, pending the departure of a table of six which had just finished. When the lingering table of six finally left, it seemed the entire staff of the restaurant went to work to set the table for us. They suggested we pre-order an appetizer and it was on the table when we sat so that we had something to eat immediately. We asked for some soup for our 92 year old, and the owner personally delivered it in about 60 seconds! Our server was friendly, personable and prompt. She made every effort to keep things moving along after our wait for a table. The food was excellent and do save room for dessert!! Terrific hospitality!"}
{"text":"I often times order the wrong entree, and believe that's what happened this time.   I started with the chicken pastini soup, which I liked, except that there was no sign of chicken, but instead 2 small meatballs.  My husband had the same and his cup looked identical to mine.   I then had the pepperoni chicken.  Although the chicken was tender, hot, cooked well and had a fair amount of pepperoni on top, the enormous amount of rather bland sauce made it not very tasty.   Disappointing.   The veal saltimboca my husband had was very different than any I had ever seen, but he enjoyed it, although would have liked more ham.  My mother, who was with us and needed gluten free food was accommodated very well by the chef, who served her chicken Romano and a baked potato, which she enjoyed.  Atmosphere is nothing special and with a large party there, it became loud.  Pulling out of their parking lot is never easy.  Prices are prob ably a few dollars more than they should be based on food quality."}
{"text":"To Tarantino this experience.... \"I hope things go good for you guys,\" said the waiter at the end of the meal. Broken wine glasses. Ranch all over my phone. Missing entrees.  I made a reservation at Calabria's a few weeks before traveling into town for my aunt's memorial dinner. During that call, I gave directions about what we wanted for the meal, including a specific menu and a memorial area. That's why when we arrived and were asked all the same questions again, I was a little bit confused. Our table of 13 shouldn't have been extremely taxing for the waiters, yes I said waiters plural, but what we didn't know is that we should've buckled up for the next 2 hours.  Every time our main waiter came from the kitchen, he would announce how the next step of dinner worked. \"I'm going to put your order in and then you'll get your salads.\" How else does this work? Every interruption like this left our whole table speechless.  We ordered a few bottles of wine, specifically a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Riesling. We received a Merlot and were asked about what we wanted besides a Riesling, since they were out. We were told we wouldn't want the Chardonnay....except that's what we ended up picking. That's way closer than a Rosé or another red. \"We'll pour it,\" we said. We didn't want to take the chance of having wine all over us. When the wine glasses were on their way out, they all of a sudden tumbled onto the floor. \"Don't worry, only 1 broke\" said our waiter. We turned around and there's 5 on the floor.  When our orders were taken, half of the table was forgotten about. I actually had to leave the table and grab a waitress to finish taking our order. I'm not sure how you miss 4 people at the table, but it happened. When our appetizers arrived (soups and salads) the waiter didn't know what salad dressing was which. \"Is that ranch?\" It's definitely Italian.\" It was definitely not Italian. When my salad was reached over my shoulder, the ranch spilled all over my phone which was sitting on the table. Who know ranch coating could make a phone look so good?   When the food arrived, it was left on trays staring at us, waiting to be handed out for what felt like 5 minutes, getting cold, before the food reached the actual table. Waiting on the last meal, the waiter was more concerned about sides than making sure the last meal made it to the table.  Our meal ended with our waiter asking if we brought a cake. Um, no. And upon handing my credit card back left us with his parting comment, \"I hope things go good for you guys.\" Did the memorial table we created not hint to that fact that this was a memorial? Awkward.  The best part...that our family was together. Definitely not anything about this place!  The worst part...wishing I had made a reservation somewhere else.  Ever since I was a kid, I heard people rave about Calabria's. What are any of those people thinking? I honestly don't understand why this place is so packed. It is beyond me how anyone enjoys this food. For a family restaurant I expected so much more! It was our first ever visit here and we won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"Three of us went here and thought the meals were very good.  Only problem was the bread they served us tasted like it was a week old!  I had the scrod medallions with spinach and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Although I have eaten here many times over the past 20 years, most of my trips were for lunch. This past week my wife and I dined there for dinner. Service was prompt and professional, even though the server was fairly new in her position. The atmosphere is nothing special and the acoustics bad (there was a party of 10 towards the back of the restaurant that sounded like a party of 20). The menu is pretty broad, but weighted heavily toward pasta and Italian.  We both ordered the chicken pastina soup. The broth was just OK. There were a few small meatballs and absolutely no chicken in either of our soups. It was laughable.   My wife ordered the pepperoni chicken and I the chicken saltimboca. Both chickens were tender. The sauce (gravey, to those who prefer the old world Italian term) for my entree was great and I very much enjoyed my entree.   The marinara sauce on the pepperoni chicken is average, at best. This recipe has not changed over the years and it is bland and somewhat tasteless.   At $17 per entree (with only one side, and a soup or salad) a patron should reasonably expect better quality."}
{"text":"We had a funeral dinner here, somehow they lost track of how many we told them were coming so ran short of food.  So we paid for full  plates, didn't really get full plates toward the end so overpaid several hundred dollars.   They made no attempt to make it right either.  Ill never recommend them.   If you intend to use them MAKE SURE on the day of the event you make them read back to you the number of people they are cooking for or it may leave a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"It's Calabria's - what more can you say. Great good, reasonable prices, and a nice, relaxing atmosphere.  This location and the Upper St. Clair location are both winners. Everything is homemade. The restaurants are super clean, the menu has a nice variety, and the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ate there this evening with a group of nine.  The waitress mentioned she was new so I thought OK; however, I feel this restaurant should at least have trained their employees. Took forever to order, get drinks, much less the salads and meals.  I ordered veal marsala.  It was served luke warm in a \"jarred gravy\" sauce.  I reminded her about my baked potato which finally arrived after I finished dinner.  It was busy when we first arrived at 7PM but everyone left and we were the only ones in the dining room and service was no better.  So it was a disappointing evening with regard to service and food.  Perhaps they should do better training new employees.  Used to be a good restaurant but has gone downhill in service and food quality."}
{"text":"Note #1: This used to be called Mama Lena's \"way back in the day\" as the folk would say it.   Note #2: I forgot to jot down their hours, and they aren't listed on the website, but I think it said on the door that they're open until 9PM Monday-Thursday and Sunday, and until 11PM on Friday and Saturday. Like it is with any other place, I guess it wouldn't hurt to call before you go.  Calabria's is surprisingly casual despite the elegant interiors. Their menu runs the gamut of Italian American cuisine, including the typical inexpensive hoagies 'n wings fodder to more sophisticated, pricier, and traditional pasta, chicken, seafood, beef, and veal dishes. They even have Filet Mignon!   FYI Time Before Ya Get Ideas: The only pizza they have on the docket is a white pizza app. Just lettin' ya know. I almost ordered some.   Me and the family sort of flaked out with our takeout, eschewing the Chicken Cacciatore and Fetuccine Primavera for, you pegged it, hoagies 'n wings...and fries and calzones.   I can tell you up front and without hesitation that their Italian Hoagie is a winner. The meat was generous, the bread was gorgeously golden and crunchy, and the dressing had more than a bit of sass.  No, I didn't eat Snooki. Man, I wouldn't touch her with a ten foot...  Sorry. Bill Maher's on the TV as I write this. Cable television is such a bad influence.   Our buffalo wings were marked \"Wings Of The Buffalo\" on the styrofoam. Now I've heard of the Winged Bulls of Nineveh, but...  They weren't bad. They had a lot of snap and bite to 'em, but I've had better.  The fries were sublime, almost gourmet. No joking.  These are made The Right Way instead of The Wrong Way (musical reference to a band I don't listen to). I didn't expect them to hold up that well on the way home. They are the definition of crisp, so unsoggy, and had a buttery flavor (peanut oil? fried twice?), and we just couldn't stop demolishing them.   The star of this dinnertime highlight reel however, is the meatball calzone.   The inside of the calzone was a positively plush tetrad of meatballs, tomato sauce, mozzarella, and provolone. The outside was composed of a dough was supremely satin.  When I picked it up, it felt like a woman.  I know, it's so weird, and I know that I'm writing this on a Friday night, but...  If you want to experience the living, breathing, yeast-imbibed, freshly ground, freshly crushed, freshly stretched embodiment of Home Made, get yourself a Calabria's calzone and split it with someone you like.   Grandmothers with angel wings and halos must be the ones preparing them.   Seriously, I'm THIS CLOSE from eating the other half of that categorically celestial calzone.   God, it's so good I'm using words I never use in conversation!   Hell, I want to take it out of the fridge and reheat it just to hold it.   If I'm being weird, tell me, and I'll stop.   I'm trapped in the Calzone Zone, bunkies..."}
{"text":"We have lived less than a mile away for years and always forgot this restaurant was here. We visited tonight for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. The food and service were both very good. Our group had a chicken dish, a fish dish, a pasta dish, a calzone and a couple appetizers and each enjoyed their meal. The decor is a bit outdated, but overall our experience was really good and we will return."}
{"text":"Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there."}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars.  Food allergy friendly with a lot of choices. Prices are fair with large portions.  The greek vinaigrette with feta was really good. The food was fine for a casual meal--no complaints. Our waitress was pleasant, attentive, and really went out of her way to work with the gluten allergy at the table.  Nothing special, but still a more than acceptable place for dinner."}
