{"text":"Expensive. Bad tasting burger. Gave them two stars because they have healthier meat than other places (their claim)"}
{"text":"Halal halal halal. That's deserves 5 Stars alone!  I had a spectacular looking burger and it was delicious. I ordered the following:
4 oz Hero Burger with Beef Bacon with Bamboo Charcoil Buns that looks out of this world. I added crispy onions, roasted red peppers, maple BBQ sauce and finally Hero sauce. 

Highly recommended. This burger not only looks amazing, it tastes so good. 
5/5"}
{"text":"We tried their new Lobster Burger and it was not disappointing. Nice chunks of lobster and a perfectly cooked burger, it's up to you on what other condiments you need in order to make the burger complete. For us it, was just tomatoes! However, the size of the sides(fries or onions rings) NEED to be larger as they are barely enough qualified to be called a filler to your meal. I should have ordered two orders. But, the burgers saved the day!"}
{"text":"The food was awful and extremely salty. The dashboard said if you don't receive a receipt you get your meal free so I didn't receive one and mentioned it(it says it's only valid when you're at the front), so then the lady who is supposedly manager argues about how she doesnt give one cause it's a waste of paper and all this nonsense refusing to do it. A bunch of customers were behind me witnessing this and shook their heads at the so-called 'manager'. Some advised me to messaged their HQ, in which I did but apparently it's their entire chain that provides bad service. They didn't respond to my initial complaint, then when I wrote asking why in a separate ticket without details, they emailed for details, and then when I wrote what happened they decided not to reply again. I wouldn't go here. Bad service, food, and not true to their word. Pretty much won't go to any Hero Burger again."}
{"text":"I tried Hero Burger for the first time a few weeks back and so I brought my boyfriend to this location. I got the Lobster burger and he went for a Salmon burger. I was surprised to see how much lobster meat there was in the burger! The salmon was also grilled perfectly. We spent about $25 on the two combos but it was sooooo worth the money! Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Had my first Hero Burger experience about a week ago and decided to come back to try something different. I got the Heavy Hitter because I was so hungry and it really hit me heavily! Great burger, again."}
{"text":"OK burger, good fries (they have a peculiar flavor I've never tasted before in a fry -- kind of mushy, which I tend to like.) Burgers can get pretty pricey once you start adding on toppings -- it's a much better bang for your buck if you order a \"secret menu\" burger that has a bunch of toppings for a fraction of what they'd cost on their own. Burger patties themselves seem a little too harshly pressed together,(?) making the patty seem a bit processed. Wouldn't make a special trip next time I'm in TO for this meal but if it happened to be around when I'm hungry and in a pinch, I'd grab one."}
{"text":"Garbage burgers.  This location killed the Hero experience for me.  I came here because I had been to the one at Richmond Hill and I loved the burgers there.  They were juicy in every bite and I couldn't get enough of the fries. 

At this location however, the burgers were dry.  I had literally one dab of ketchup in the entire burger! Outrageous!

The fountain machine was cool, where you could mix the flavors but it tasted like sugar water more than anything else. 

Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Food:  good burger, but pricey.  cooked well.  onion rings were good, but one ring i had was made up of the part of the onion you peel off.  i dont not if their rings are frozen or batter there, so I figured i would just mention it.

service: horrible.  the cashier was standing there talking to a girl behind the counter with him(who wasnt in uniform) so i dont even know if she worked there.  i said my order was for eat in.  he sees me standing waiting for my order while carrying a child.  doesnt let me know i could sit at the table and the food would be brought to me.  if constantly chatting up this girl to the point that customers had to wait for service.  when my food is ready, he hands me my tray while he sees me still carrying my child, and he doesnt even hold the door open for me to get table.  terrible terrible customer service.   in case owners want to know who was working: date of service was friday july 8th just before 5pm."}
{"text":"Worst Hero Burger I've been to!
The people working are lazy and rude.
They are extremely slow at there job and don't act like they want to be there.
When your paying this much for fast food the service should be better than what I had received! 
This is more of a take out than sit down. 1 table with 2 chair in the entire place.. 
There's a little patio you can sit on outside but only in the summer ..."}
{"text":"Came here because of the glorious coke machine. Only place I know where you can get fountain Cherry Coke Zero along with a few hundred other flavours."}
