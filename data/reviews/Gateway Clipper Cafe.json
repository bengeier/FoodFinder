{"text":"Was staying at the Sheraton Station Square and was looking for a quick breakfast option. This seems to be the only place around for breakfast. Honestly I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. Ordered egg and ham breakfast. Also the French toast ( super tasty covered in corn flakes and served with fresh berries and whipped cream). The staff was very friendly and it was fast.   Went back on another day for a quick lunch (chicken tenders / fries)   Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"The service here is not exactly friendly. In addition they only had one cook who ended up giving our order to people who ordered after us. No apologies. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy being neglected? Well then Gateway Clipper Cafe is just the spot for you!  FOOD: 3/5, average in every way. I got a spicy/buffalo chicken sandwich, it was nothing to write home about. The concept of house chips is nice but they were a bit on the soft side.  SERVICE: 1/5, only because yelp doesn't take 0's or negative numbers as a rating. When I got in line, there were 4 other people in front of me. We were collectively ignored for at least 25 minutes, and it was a battle of willpower and patience to stay in line. I eventually reached the front of the line, not because any orders had been taken, but because everyone in front of me was so tired of waiting and eventually left the restaurant without any food. During that time, a new line had formed behind me that stretched to the door. And through the entire wait, there was not a single sign of acknowledgement from anyone on the staff. It would be one thing if the staff said, \"We're a bit swamped at the moment, we'll be with you in just a moment,\" or even just made eye contact. Instead, one of them looked really hard at the floor when walking past the line, and the other let their eyes glaze over and pass over the line, literally gazing beyond us at no particular point.  Half of the people in line didn't even have orders to put in, they just wanted to pay for the grab'n'go food from the front of the shop, and all of them ended up being ignored with the rest of us. Understaffed and unorganized."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare. Burgers, sandwiches, etc  We ordered a couple breakfast sandwiches and coffees. The coffee is a great deal! $1.75 for 16oz! The breakfast sandwiches looked kind of ugly but tasted of excellent greasiness...  It did it's job of holding us over. We wanted to avoid purchasing snacks on the boat feeling that there would be a considerable upcharge there.  This is the official cafe for the clipper. You can purchase boat tickets here too. And after the boat ride, you'll get a BOGO coupon for a 16oz coffee/iced tea."}
{"text":"I had been invited to a soft opening of the new Gateway Clipper Cafe in Bessemer Court at Station Square. They offer a breakfast menu until 10:30 AM, then lunch and dinner. I stopped in for a breakfast item. I chose the breakfast sandwich of egg white, spinach and tomato on a bagel. It was quite good and got it to go, along with a cup of Seattle's Best coffee. The bagel was nicely grilled, the egg whites were fluffy and seasoned, the spinach and tomato were fresh. All breakfast sandwiches are available on bagels, English muffins or croissant, egg, sausage, bacon, cheese, egg whites, spinach and tomato are available to create your ideal breakfast Sammy. Pancakes and French toast are also available. Breakfast platters are available, including a ghost pepper cheese omelet, breakfast burrito and make your own omelet.   I went back for lunch and had the best Southwest spicy Black bean burger. All burgers are cooked to order and come with fries or kettle chips. The burger I had was indeed spicy, but not overly so, the slaw that was the topping for this burger mellows it out and adds a wonderful flavor and crunch. A texture often missing from a vegan burger.   There are panini offerings including a Chicken pesto, roast beef and balsamic onion jam, a Cuban Midnight panini, an updated version of the classic Cuban, which looked good. This one is done with ham and turkey in place of pork, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickle and grilled to perfection. The Hog Heaven panini also looked good, uncured smoked ham, bacon, provolone and mozzarella and pressed till the bread was crunchy!  There is a huge grab and go section with premade sandwiches, fresh fruit, yogurt, salads and desserts.   My guess is, the deep fried pretzel is going to be a big seller. Even though it's deep fried, it's not greasy at all. We tried the salted caramel pretzel and it's amazing! The pretzel looks more like a giant garlic stick, about a foot long, skewered and deep fried. What you get is an extra crunchy outside and chewy center. There are many versions of this pretzel including cinnamon and sugar, garlic, and just plain with salt.   The top of the menu says all natural ingredients at an affordable price. The most expensive menu item is $7.25.   The Gateway Clipper Cafe is bright and airy, televisions inside, a patio for the summer months. It's a welcome addition to the chain restaurants that populate Station Square."}
{"text":"Little place with one cook and awesome food. The place is clean, service is fast and everyone is treated like a local. Best caprese panini I've ever had!"}
