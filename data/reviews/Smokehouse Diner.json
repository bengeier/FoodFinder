{"text":"The best fried chicken in Calgary. You wouldn't believe the quality and quantity of the juicy chicken.  The diner is nothing  to write home about but you don't mind a joint like this if the food is greaseless and tasty. Ask for the large potato wedges as a side. Yum."}
{"text":"Live near here and thought I would give it a try.  Definately trucker food cooked mostly in a microwave and on a flatop....right out in the open.  I do admit that it's insanely cheap and there might be something worthwhile on the menu but I don't feel like going back to try.  I ordered the eggs benny and it was served on a hamburger bun with chicken gravy instead of hollandaise."}
{"text":"Was in the area today and saw this place and thought I'd try it out.  What can I say, small, shabby place, so if you're looking for fancy, stay out.  If you want fresh cooked food, COME IN !!   Portions are big, hot and fresh!!  I say their chicken is better than the big chains!!! Mmm!!!   Definitely a good place to go!"}
{"text":"The owner of this business has a very bad attitude and is unfamiliar with manners and customer service protocols. He has a sign outside that says all day breakfast, he refused to make us breakfast and then tried to tell us what we should order. It was around 3 in the afternoon, so I didn't see a problem ordering breakfast.  He refused to make us coffee because he would have to make a fresh pot, his exact words.....  All of the food was very substandard and the chicken was slimy, the fries were the small burnt bits that stay in the bottom of the basket after a days cooking ....... Should have left after the first cue..... will NEVER darken his doorstep again.  This experience reminded me of a certain episode of Seinfeld....  I actually almost burst out laughing on several occasions. The men's washroom was out of a 1980s mining town... Some people rave about his chicken. Good Luck!!  If you feel like being abused this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"A famous part of a Fargo Tour in Calgary! We arrived with a company of friends with no expectations of food, (Just seeing the location with exactly the same tablecloths, bar seats and decorations as in the TV series was enough to make us happy) and decided to order a few burgers and fries. Portions were quite large, food tasted good and fresh and I particularly liked the fries which were evidently homemade, crispy and at the same time full of potato flavor (not salty of seasoned). The owner, who was also our cook and server was very friendly, helpful and communicative. Now, this is not a trendy-refined brunch spot and it does not attempt to be one, which is reflected clearly in prices and type of food served, it is a diner in Calgary industrial area that serves simple yet tasty food in portions that will satisfy even the most avid eaters."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many a times and I just had to go in....  Well today was the day. Went for Sunday Brunch. The place is kind of a dive however the staff are very nice and attentive. i had the Denver Omelette and my date the bacon, eggs, and toast. The food was substandard but very affordable - our entire meal was less than $15 with coffee and all; even came with a free take-home Calgary Sun!  Never had processed cheese on an omelette before; don't think I will ever have it on an omelette again either.  So check this out if you are in the area and McDonald's is not your thing.  This was interesting... next week it is back to healthy organic locally sourced hippie stuff for me!"}
