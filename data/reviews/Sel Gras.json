{"text":"This is probably my top five fave restos in Montreal. Went there so many times Ive lost count and I'm finally writing a well deserved review. I was first introduced here for my friends bachelorette party which happened to be valentines weekend and I went with the table d'hote they created for the holiday. Let me tell you foodgasms galore. I was so impressed with all the food I had to go back again and every other time it was amazing. The staff is great, service amazing, oh and I forgot to mention their amazing selection of drinks/cocktails. I recommend Sel Gras to everyone i meet and I need to go back again soon"}
{"text":"Went for Brunch august 8 2015 with no expectations. was completely overwhelmed. aside from the kind of uppity waitress who really didn't want to be working today, the experience was not far from perfect. I'm glad to see the other good reviews because today there was no one there and I was worried it wouldn't stay open. We sat by the window in the sun and had by far the best brunch i have ever had, bar none. My husband was having the Cesar maison (he said it was the best cocktail he has ever had) so I ordered a mimosa and waited for my watered down orange juice but instead i got what i am pretty sure was a full glass of real champagne with a teaspoon of orange juice. IMPRESSIVE start. the oysters were nothing far from sublime - i woud have eaten 10 more - and then i ordered croque monsieur with an egg in it and we couldn't figure out what it was fried in but if it had been labelled 'carcinogenic' i would have eaten it regardless. the fries were home made and didn't need ketchup; the salads were perfect and his frittata was delicious. For desert, we read and memorized the dinner menu. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Nous y étions pour le brunch. L'amabiance du resto est sympa et le service cordial. Il n'y avait pas de pain sur la table et ça a pris du temps après qu'on l'ait commandé. Il était toutefois chaud! Les plats sont plus exotiques sur le menu qu'en vrai. Ils sont bons mais rien d'excepetionnel... Et ils gagneraient à être un peu plus généreux..."}
{"text":"Although Sel Gras has always been a little bit more under the radar,  I do think this upscale but casual Mile End bistro deserves to be given a chance.The chorizo plate we had for starter was fabulous and all 3 main dishes (lamb, duck and fish) were nicely executed. Check out my article about it to find out more. https://delifeed.ca/2016/04/27/sel-gras-cosy-mile-end-bistro-that-deserves-a-try/"}
{"text":"Service was unbelievably slow (over 1hr between appetizers and mains, about 30 mins between ordering and receiving dessert). Food was excellent once it arrived."}
{"text":"If I could rate it 3.5 that's what I would do. Way way too expensive for the poor service received.   The octopus and the watercress salad were delicious. The halibut was too too salty, for a meal that price i am surpised that the kitchen can't master the seasoning. The black cod was good. Very (too) rich.  The bloody mary was delicious.  Service was extremely bad. My friend waited for her cocktail for 20 minutes and it was tasteless (made with watermelon juice). The waitress never checked on us and we had to ask for everything: water, dessert menu, bill, etc.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Sel Gras accommodated our group of 9 and took really good care of us. The food was delicious and ambiance was great. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow. Eaten two very different meals here and loved them both. The summary: delicious dishes, great cocktails, wonderful service. Eat here!  The details: Had dinner and brunch at Sel gras. Bartender had an unnamed whiskey cocktail of the day, and she walked over the talked us through it (it was splendid, by the way). We skipped the appetizers and had the elk and the red snapper--both just superb. We didn't have dessert, but the options looked great.  Brunch: We ordered the frittata, croque monsieur, caesar salad with fried egg, and sausage salad (if you're not French, look this up--it is NOT a green salad with sausage!). Fries were hot, crispy, and fresh. Side salads had beautiful greens. No alcohol that day for us; we drank coffee and café au lait, which was more like milk with a little bit of coffee. So if you're more of a coffee than milk lover, just stick with regular java or have them add an extra shot of espresso."}
{"text":"Restaurant très sympathique : excellent accueil,  resaltó confirmée et table prête. Les plats étaient vraiment bon et je recommande le saumon gravlax. En dessert,  le gâteau au chocolat était une tuerie.   Ambiance super sympa et déco simple mais feeling un peu à la maison.  Addition raisonnable.  On reviendra"}
{"text":"Really nice brunch.  We tried here because Lawerence was lined up out the door. Very happy we discovered this little gem.  Very unique flavors.   Generous portions. Will definitely come back again for brunch."}
{"text":"We came by for brunch - Everything we ordered was delicious - the space is beautiful and the staff is welcoming and kind. Strongly recommend the frittata and the granola - both were extraordinary."}
{"text":"J'ai eu mal au cur après avoir manger là. J'ai pris un risotto, c'était très bon mais peut être trop lourd pour mon estomac.  Il n'était pas très content qu'on ne commandait pas d'entrées, et juste un verre de vin. Mais il était 22h..."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Had a deelish brunch at Sel Gras today. French toast, grilled shrimp and sausage with mushrooms all had their distinct flavours and each were incredible."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.   We entered just before the kitchen closed and were promptly offered seats.   The bartender was happy to make suggestions, and his gnocchi suggestion was spot on. Best meal in Montreal and excellent service as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give 5 star but the whole experience left me a bit indifferent... On the bright side, excellent dish presentation and nice decor. The gravlax was good but not close to what I've tasted before...an explosion of colours and Portuguese / Italian influence. The risotto was a bit blend, perhaps because I asked for a vegetarian option?  The truffle taste was nowhere to be found!  The service needs to relax and smile more... Maybe a little more love & happiness in the kitchen would help?  High five for the dessert, try the mousse with dates, coffee and chestnut cream, it was like a healthy and \"to die for\" version of tiramisu!  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Just had brunch and was impressed by the amazing preparation and unique flavours/menu options. The focus is on the cuisine, so the portions are a bit small, especially for brunch."}
{"text":"Had brunch/late lunch here and super impressed with the flavour.  I had the Butternut squash Fritata and it was awesome!  My son had the French Toast dripping with chocolate and creme fraiche. He enjoyed it very much.  Will update the review once i pop in for diner and see if the range increases."}
{"text":"Une belle découverte, bouffe, ambiance, service.  La pieuvre grillée servie avec haricots rouges, pesto de choux frisé, oignons marinés, vinaigrette au poivron rôti, chorizo est vraiment délicieuse"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch items, Sel Gras offers many options for whatever you're in the mood for. Brunch starts at 11 but will pickup around 12:30. The restaurant will get packed and the atmosphere will change and become more social."}
{"text":"Can never figure out the half star thingy, but if I could, would give an extra half star. Sat at the bar and Matt took great care of us. Dishes were original, fresh and tasty. I love tartar, but the extra crunchiness the chef adds is Stellar. And the Bison main dish was delicious. Hubby enjoyed his fish tartar and fish of the day special too. Will put this place in the repeat visit list! Matt certainly provided that extra push to make the meal more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Location: On the main, in the Mile End area. Street parking is available [metered] and the closest subway is likely Laurier. You'll need to walk from there.   The place: I feel like I've been saying this in all my reviews lately, but what can I say? The place is small but well laid out. Love the wood floors and just the overall feel and look of the place. It's comfortable and relaxed.   The goods: I ordered the scallops, served with creamy polenta, asparagus and a hardboiled egg. OK, so first, I'm not sure if this dish was meant to be served hot or cold.... but my dish was cold - from the egg to the polenta, to the asparagus. That being said, the flavours of this dish meshed really well together, and I loved the polenta and could eat it by the spoonful. Maybe they should package it and serve it like pudding! Anyway, my only comment is that they served me two scallops - thus, the portion did seem a bit small to me. That being said, I was satiated when I left - so for me, the portion was just right. I would've liked to have maybe 1-2 more scallops on the plate. The waitress asked if we wanted bread (home-made) and I said yes. I'm not 100% sure if I'm correct in this assumption, but it tasted like cinnamon/raisin brad (sans raisins) - it was amazing! Don't skip the bread.  My friend ordered the sausage salad, which she enjoyed, but she felt that it was very filling for a brunch dish. I have to say that the portion was quite large and looked more like a stew than a salad. Great dish but if you're not starving, you might want to opt for something lighter. I tasted the sausage and it was delicious.   Service: Good! Our water glasses were always full and staff checked in on us throughout the meal. We had one minor 'issue' that was resolved immediately, and in a professional manner.   Price point: My dish was $17 + taxes and tip.   I'm definitely planning to check these guys out during their dinner service, in the future."}
{"text":"Good, but not mind-blowing, maybe slightly over-done, and certainly overpriced.  Don't get me wrong, it was good and pleasant, service was great overall although it lingered quite a lot towards the end (maybe in the hope that we would order more drinks?), but it's absolutely not a \"$$\" price range, much more a \"$$$\". Entrees (I mean, main course dishes) are mostly above $30. We stuck to appetizers, more because they attracted us more than the main course than really for the budget. Nevertheless, for 8 oysters, 3 appetizers and 4 beers, we landed a $135 diner, which I find a bit exaggerate (I know plenty of places in Boston where for this price, you could either eat and drink something really exceptional, or feed twice as much people for a similar quality if note better). The octopus was certainly the best I had in town so far (this includes comparatives with Helena and Taverne F), but it was on the scarce side (3 little pieces), and still not at the level of the best one I had (in a little bistro/bar a vin in Niagara on the Lake... with twice the portion and half the price). The 2 tartars (tuna and beef) were good, but too heavy, un-necessarily creamy, the taste of tuna or beef was totally hidden by the respective too strong dressings."}
{"text":"Service hors pair et nourriture incroyable!  Le tartare de ton et la morue étaient dé-li-ci-eux ! J'ai trouvé la crème brulée un peu trop salée par contre et j'aurais aimé avoir une option sur le menu sans viande, mais ceci n'a pas empêché le fait que j'ai adoré ma soirée au Sel Gras !!"}
{"text":"After hitting the Mile End for a brunch date with the girlfriends, we realized our usual spot had a crazy line up. We decided to walk around and find something with less of a line up. We've accidentally stumbled upon Sel Gras on Saint Laurent, and it's been my favorite brunch place ever since.   Good : Cozy and trendy atmosphere, not too crowded on weekends, and the best salmon gravlax ever. The dishes are well presented and a good portion size. It's not your typical eggs and bacon kinda brunch, Sel Gras really steps up the brunch menu! We had really good service & food arrived pretty quick. I am not really a brunch person (overpriced eggs and greasy heart attack inducing bacon? No, thanks.), but this place has definitely changed my mind with their impressive menu.  Bad : Water didn't come as frequently, but that's okay because I am always prepare and I smuggle my own water bottle at restaurants.   Bottom Lines : I adore this little restaurant in the Mile End, I've definitely returned a few more times to try their different plates, but the salmon gravlax still has a special place in my heart. Oh, and it also helps that their waiters are ridiculously handsome tattooed hipster men."}
{"text":"Very good service from both bar tender and the waiter. The food was very fresh and tasty. I felt healthy after our oyster and fish indulgence. Will defensively go back there"}
{"text":"After failing to get tables at Lawrence and Sparrow on a Sunday afternoon (rookie mistake), my friend and I went to Sel Gras for brunch. I ordered the mimosa, which they use fresh pressed juice, and my friend the moka; both were delicious and complimented our meal. My friend got the salmon gravlax and I ordered the pain perdu and was served a thick slice of bread that was crispy and golden on the outside and soft and fluffy in the middle. The pineapples and herbs as toppings went well with the chocolate sauce and was delicious. Best option for breakfast/brunch if all other restos are full"}
{"text":"I went in with a friend visiting from out of town. We were actually headed somewhere else but they were closed and so we stopped in, it was late on a Wednesday night but the guy at the bar (the owner) was so sweet and very welcoming.   The food was great, we split three of the sides, I have since been back and have bad more of the menu and again, its amazing. The portions are large so I don't mind the prices, I feel like I am getting what I am paying for.   For me its more about the feel of the restaurant, the ambiance and vibe. I couldn't be more impressed with the staff and hospitality. Matthieu, the owner, is one of a kind.   Try this place, especially on those week day nights when you dont want to cook, you get the hospitality of being with a family and the food is great!"}
{"text":"We went to Sel Gras for brunch. Once you stepped into the restaurant, you could smell the aromas of the brunch and great coffee. We both ordered the frittata which came with a small salad and yummy potatoes. We also asked for a side of their homemade bread which had a hint of cinnamon, very delicious."}
{"text":"Went there with a group during the weekend of the F1 race.  Atmosphere was wonderful and the food was fantastic.  Portions were a nice size and more than satisfied.  We had a wonderful time and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Excellente découverte! Comme bien d'autre personne, je me dois de recommander la morue. Les  desserts sont tout simplement divins."}
{"text":"If I could give this place half stars, I would give it a 3.5 stars. The food was good, but not outstanding - several dishes were certainly better than others. The portions were fairly large, the prices a bit above average, and the service was a little slow.  I expected this to have a lot more Portuguese influence, but other than the grilled octopus and Portuguese donut, I didn't really find a lot of Portuguese fusion or dishes.  It's very much your basic American / Canadian new restaurant with about 8 appetizers / small plates and 6 entrees to choose from.  There were 6 of us in our party and we each got 2 appetizers for our meal. Some were definitely better than others. It was definitely enough food - the appetizers were like a small entree size, so it would have been too much food if I had gotten one appetizer and one entree. It was strange that the bread was brought out about 30 min after we had ordered and as we were waiting for our food.  Lettuce, fresh mozzarella di bufala, caramelized walnuts and red grapes with truffle vinaigrette ($14) - I really loved the salad but I love anything with truffle on it. The cheese was fresh and the walnuts and grapes were a nice sweet touch with the rest of the salad to help balance it out. The salad was a generous size, and would have been enough to fill me up if it had had protein on it. I'd definitely recommend this for just one person or to share between 2-3 people.  Fried scallops, cauliflower couscous with candied yellow beets, green beans and fresh herbs ($16) - At almost $8 per scallop, I would've thought they had massaged each scallop or it was laced with gold. It was good, and I liked the cauliflower \"couscous\" (basically grated cauliflower to look like the texture of couscous), but $16 is pricey for this.  I tried a bite of my friend's tuna tartare and thought it was not that good. It wasn't well proportioned with the avocado, and tomato and each mouthful just tasted like raw white onion. Not so good. My friend had the beef tartare and said it was overly garlicky.   The wine we got was great (see my pictures) - very smooth - we ended up with 2 bottles.   Overall, a fairly pricey meal - it came out to $65 per person with each person getting 2 appetizers, along with 2 bottles of wine for the table and a dessert to share. Not sure if I'd come back here again - I'm happy I tried it, but I think I'd prefer to go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Well, this lovely calm white room has been open for 8 or 9 months and now that I've eaten there I feel shame at having waited so long to sample the fresh, comforting flavours on offer. The menu features a mix of local Quebec farm fresh inspiration with Mediterranean and especially Portuguese influences. The cod dish I had with super crisp and plump little heritage tomatoes, small squares of goat feta, tucked into an eggplant puree was a perfect taste of summer, and plentiful enough to still be filling despite the fancy look of it. My friend's pork and clams with little pickled onions and Brussels sprouts and potatoes was such a nice cold weather dish you could imagine curling up with it around a fire while the leaves changed.   We sat at the bar on a quiet Monday and enjoyed friendly conversation with the owners and staff, and sipped wine and sweetly improvised cocktails. I'd like to go back and eat in the booth in the winter, I think this food is well suited to being tucked in comfortably by a window. I'd love to see more of Quebec's amazing local beers on the menu, and a few natural or biodynamic wines by the glass would be super sweet. I also think this is a spot that might benefit from a ~50$ table d'hote, some suggestions to guide you through a great meal and introduce you to the interesting things on the menu. But really, I had a perfect delicious evening here and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The best diner experience in a while now.  The server was really accommodating and accepted our late reservation. We were greeted by a really warm welcome. The server explained the menu really well and really patient. Their bead was served warm, which was super delicious. My friend and I got there early while waiting for two other friends and we ate a lot of bread, lol. Got some oysters, octopus and one more fish for appetizer. Also four main dishes, sea bass, elk, duck, and lamb. They tasted like heaven for sure! Each dish was well executed and packed with flavours. The lamb fell off the bone, highly recommend! The service was really really good, I forgot the servers name, but he really payed a lot of attention to all the details and recommended a great wine for my night.  This will be a new go to spot for me in the future!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very pretty. The organic wine we had was great. The appetizer - I had the salmon gravlax... was very tasty - although tough to cut through? Service was not great - asked for bread and never got it; young lady taking our wine order definitely was either in a very bad mood, or had a major attitude problem.   Mains were not great. The Bison and Black Cod both disappointed. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, but  service was atrocious. We had a large party, and it took us 3 hours to get our main courses."}
{"text":"If you are in the Mile end area then Sel gras is a the place to go eat! they have a nice menu with great choices!!! It was really hard to decide what to order so we picked 4 plates to share with my wife. Since the portion is generous i suggest you to pick few plates to share so you can have a little taste of everything. We had 2 appetizers : deer tataki and octopus stew. Entree: their most popular plate : black cod Dessert: the Portuguese donut  I have to say that everything we ate was delicious, it the combination of all the ingredients coming together that makes every plate super delicious!  Deer tataki was really good, it was coming with caramelized figues, peanuts and wild mushrooms. The meat was tender with the little candy crunch of the figues it is amazing!  My other highlight is the famous black cod marinated in tamari and miso! It is hard to describe, you just need to try it! A bit of the black cod with the grilled brussel sprouts, parnship puree and other ingredient all together is just DELICIOUS!  To finish the night, our belly had a little room for a dessert and we weren't disappointed. the dessert is just decadent. The moist beignet filled with custard topped with a chocolat hazelnut and raspberry sauce. Wow i could have one by myself and lick all the sauce on the plate! I was still thinking about the next day!  Conclusion: im coming back for sure! A great foodies night :)"}
{"text":"Stepping into Sel Gras in the middle of a cold windy montreal evening, you feel the low warm lighting wash over you as you slowly start to thaw. The waiter was quick to seat us at a lovely booth (thankfully it was a slow Monday night or I doubt the 2 booths are free often!) where we sunk into the welcoming leather. The ambience was really created by their fantastic music!   The risotto was creamy and the arugula added and unexpected freshness to the dish. The serving size was really generous - perhaps since i ordered it without the duck confit. Glad they have a veggie item on the menu! The chicken was perfectly cooked and moist and tender according to my dining partner. Their plating is really appealing.   We finished off the evening on a very high note with a delightful creme brulee that is a must if you come here."}
{"text":"I think it is important to be as honest as possible when it comes to reviewing products. Couple key points.   1. The place is warm, small and cozy 2. Our waitress (with the amazing artichoke tattoo) was super friendly and patient.   3. the two drinks of the day were delicious. I highly recommend the ginger cocktail. sweet and spicy   4. as an appetizer make sure you order the foie-gras and deer meatball.  probably the best of the night.   5. my boyfriend and i both ordered the grilled elk and the black cod (to share). I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. overly salty and couldn't even taste the own ingredients. we mentioned to our waitress that both our dish were salty and offered her to try it.   the sauce in the dishes were fine. but our waitress said 'its must be the montreal steak spice on the meat.\" Excuse me? I'm paying 160$ and you're going to tell me you used \"montreal steak spice\"? I might as well go home and cook my own dish in that case.    I don't mind paying 2 bills for a good dinner. but the only thing that was good to my taste bud were the cocktails and entre.     Easy with the salt guys! come on."}
{"text":"If there were more stars I would give it to them. We went there for my bachelorette on valentines day weekend. Most of us had the special valentines menu which offered 6 tasting plates. I can't remember all of them but I can remember the profiteroles dessert was outstanding. As was the shrimp and oysters. Drinks are also great and strong. It's decently priced for a higher end restaurant. What makes this place is the staff and music. Matthew was our waiter and he really took care of us! I would recommend ordering as much as you can because everything is great. Go eat there now!"}
{"text":"Last week, I returned to Sel Gras after my first time there for the Yelp Elite event. I think I much prefer Sel Gras for large group events where the plates are family-style. For a two-person dinner, the place was just too loud and hectic. I got the black cod with miso and it was overly salty for my taste. We also ordered the steak and there was just a lot of confusion between the server and the kitchen about replacing some of the sides for a nut and dairy allergy. In the end, the servers were really patient and helpful. They even gave us our wine for free and offered us shooters after dinner.   The three-star rating is more based on:  - Smaller than expected portion sizes  - Underwhelming cod dish  - Bit of a chaotic environment"}
{"text":"Great spot for a date or business dinner. The service is excellent and very good choice on the menu. Their homemade bread is delicious"}
{"text":"Tout ce que j'ai mangé ici  était excellent. Le service est bon et la nourriture encore meilleures Il y a une belle carte de vin avec une moyenne de 60-65$ la bouteille notamment des importations privées.  J'ai pris l'entrée de Boulette de cerfs et foie gras avec purées de panais et petite salade c'était délicieux. L'entrée pieuvre aussi . J'ai gouté a 3 mets principaux: le Médaillon de Wapiti avec topinambour et une sauce demi-glace déliceuses. Le jaret d'agneau avec merguez et couscous est de loin niveau quantité/qualité prix qui est meilleur avec une inspiration méditerranéenne. Puis finalement le magret de canard est succulent, servis en médaillon, pomme de terre grelot et salade qui faisait chou vert. Très bon.   Niveau qualité prix, il y a un moyen de bien manger, un verre de vin pour 50-65$ par personne, mais il y a aussi moyen de monter très vite."}
{"text":"Que dire sur cet restaurant? Ambiance:Check. Bouffe succulente et bourrée de saveurs: check. Service très sympathique et donnant de bons conseils: check. Je ne peux rien dire de négatif cet endroit. J'y suis allée avec une copine un jeudi soir. Tous les plats que nous avons pris étaient à notre goût, comme si on ne pouvait se tromper en choissant un item sur la carte. Je vais y retourner définitivement."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, had the scallops and the sausage salad. Very good! Great ambiance good food good service!! I'd recommend it to anybody! We will go back to try their evening menu!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of four.  The restaurant has a very extensive wine list, including sparkling, which is available on their website as well.  We started off with a sparkling wine for appetizers, and switched to a nice bottle of red for our entrees.  To start, we split 3 appetizers between the 3 of us - the honey glazed chorizo, the gnocchi with duck confit, and the grilled octopus.  The chorizo was my favorite, which was paired nicely with a navy bean salad and garlic puree.  The chorizo is on the sweeter side even before the honey glaze, though, so know this is not a spicy dish in the least.  The gnocchi was also tasty in a creamy truffle mushroom sauce.  The octopus was my least favorite, mainly because I've had much better grilled octopus. It wasn't overdone, but usually with grilled octopus I expect a nice char and crisp to the skin, which was missing in this rendition.  The sauce was tasty however.  For mains, 2 got the catch of the day (striped sea bass) in a rice crust with quinoa and beet salad.  A second ordered the deer chop, which replaced the beef striploin on the regular menu.  I ordered the miso marinated black cod.  The cod was really fantastic and well cooked, leaving a nicely glazed and flaky fish that melted when eaten. The 'braz' style potatoes were matchstick potatoes in a chimichurri sauce of sorts, which added a nice textural contracts to the fish.  The sea bass and deer chop were also tasty, but the cod was the clear winner here.  Strangely enough, the restaurant lost power midway through our entrée. The waitstaff hardly missed a beat, however, bringing out candles to each of the tables in addition to what was already there and continued to provide service as seamlessly as possible under the circumstances.  Luckily, we were not looking for dessert, so we didn't miss out on any courses as a result.  The restaurant was still able to accommodate credit cards the old-fashioned way, which also made a difficult situation easier on everyone.  All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to tourists and locals alike - next time I'm in town, I'll stop in and try the brunch too!"}
{"text":"I was at Sel Gras recently with a very large group of people. Like, I mean we took over the place. I had the cool experience being able to try a very little bit of a lot of what they had to offer. I was wanting more....  Here's what I tried with a whole lotta great red wine:  Grilled chorizo over a bed of white beans and freshly sliced tomatoes and herbs. I really enjoyed this one. Tuna tartare with grilled mini-pita breads over a bed of tomatoes and herbs. Not one of my fav's but I'm not a tartare kinda gal. Radicchio & romaine salad with sliced grapes, toasted walnuts and caramelized onions. I LOVED THIS SALAD. Period. Grilled chicken over lentils, grilled brussels sprouts and cabbage. This was delicious, I really enjoyed it. Mini Pork chops over potato purée, sauté broccolini, bacon bits in a gravy type juice. I also really enjoyed this one. Salmon over very creamy risotto and bok-choy. This one was good but was a little mushy in the mouth.  I would return here for another lunch or dinner. The restaurant is small so I wonder if reservations would be a good idea... if it's a busy day, there may not be a seat for you!"}
{"text":"Awesome new spot on St-Laurent in the Mile End neighbourhood. The place was opened by people with tons of experience in the restaurant business in Montreal and it shows.   FOOD: Great! I ordered a pork cheek stew with lentils and it was OFF the hook. My boyfriend had the black cod and it was delicious. We shared the stuffed calamari and tuna tar tar appetizers and they were delicious. The plates are gorgeous and the portions are actually pretty big considering the caliber of the food (places this good usually serve smaller plates).    SERVICE: This is the type of place where the servers know what they are talking about and actually care about wine and food. Service is quick but casual which I like. Super chill, super quick, and honest. Could not be better.  VEGETARIANS: My boyfriend is a vegetarian and there were tons of main dish menu options for him. Although the appetizers mostly had meat in them, the kitchen was awesome and prepped those with the meat items on the side (so we could share and he could avoid the meat).  AMBIANCE: The place has a good vibe. Stylish but not overly fancy. The music was fun too (but maybe not ideal for older people as it was a little eclectic and verging on too loud for the middle-aged crowd).  I'll definitely be going back. it's now up there with my fave places in Montreal of this type like Tuck Shop and Salle a Manger.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"When I started my appetizer I was pretty sure it would be a 5 stars. However, the main courses came way too salted even if the meat was absolutely amazing. Worst, the waiter started chatting at the bar for about an hour. We spent a total time of 2 hours and half at the restaurant waiting to be served. Last but not least, the desert was a joke, we got a donut for $10. The whole desert menu was way under my expectations for a restaurant of that kind of standing. My stars only stands for the appetizer and the meat, but the rest deserves a zero. Definitely not a recommendation unless they change their deserts and most importantly their waiter."}
