{"text":"I adore Mexican food, so imagine my delight when I discovered authentic Mexican right in my neighbourhood. Unlike most of the popular burrito places popping up around town, this place is really a taste of Mexico. Soft corn tacos, tasty guacamole, nopal (cactus), queso fresco, hot sauce that actually is hot instead of the zero spice stuff that most burrito places try to pass off as \"hot\". I've been twice and had the veggie burrito (which was delicious; grilled queso oaxaca, mmm) and veggie tacos. I'm looking forward to trying more, and am sure the meat dishes are just as delicious. I'm hoping this place has the success it deserves because I want it to stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Just had a chicken burrito for lunch and it was absolutely delicious. All the fixings for less than nine dollars. I sat in to eat it and they brought me some nachos and guacamole free of charge."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite today before my stomach ate itself. This was my second visit to The Mexican Burrito and it was even better than the first.   Their food is authentic, tasty, well priced, and served with a smile and all the fixins. I'm so grateful that the Mexican Burrito is right around the corner from me!  I recommend: fish tacos, pork tacos, and ask them to just fix it how they would eat it.  My only request would be to have flour tortillas (maybe they do, I didn't ask), because I'm a gringa from Texas. Corn is more authentic though.   Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I had a veggie burrito and it was just okay, I've had better. But the owners were SO NICE and brought us chips and guac to our table. I'd probably go again since it's close-by."}
