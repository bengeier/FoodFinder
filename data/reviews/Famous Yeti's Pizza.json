{"text":"Famous Yetis is our favorite place to eat in Stoughton if we don't want to make the trek into Madison. They have good pizza and we are from the Chicago area! Love all their basics and their yeti spaghetti is fun. We have also tried their meatball subs which were tasty as well! Cute place and good service."}
{"text":"Just had a thin crust pepperoni and sausage pizza delivered. It is very flavorful and delicious! Skip the chain places and get Famous Yeti. It will be our new go to pizza place. So happy they delivered to us on the North side of Lake Kegonsa."}
{"text":"Famous Yeti's Pizza has their mojo dialed in. We had a plain-jane 16\" hand-tossed with pepperoni and sausage and it was damn near pizza perfection. Crust: perfectly charred on the outside and chewy and slightly sweet inside. Sauce: garlicky and pleasantly tomato sweet. Cheese: real savory mozzarella-chewy and super stretchy! Pepperoni: mouth watering. Sausage: the best feature of this superior pie. I know the house has a solid secret recipe, but I am tasting good pork, black pepper, fennel, some heat (maybe paprika or a bit of cayenne) and just enough garlic. Whatever else they do is magic!"}
{"text":"The pie is okay, the sauce is on the spicy side if you like spicy you'll enjoy it if you don't you won't. Felt they were a little bit chincy on the toppings got like two pieces of sausage per slice but overall it's not bad"}
{"text":"Just had a \"Zen Garden\" Stuffed Pizza delivered from Famous Yetis.
It is one of the best veggie pizzas we have ever had, of any type, anywhere.  Stuffed with large chunks of fresh vegetables: Spinach, Green Peppers, Onions, Mushrooms, and, Tomatoes, with Feta Cheese and black olives.  Tangy sauce and plenty of cheese. 
It is not a low-cal,for sure, but it was superb. 
Thanks for the great pizza!"}
{"text":"We've been to FYP several times now for date night, and have never been disappointed with the food or the service.  It's hard not to choose one of the stuffed pizzas (they are so good!), but we've also had the hand-thrown crust, and I'll tell you, it's a tough choice.  Honestly, sometimes I want to order one of each just so I don't have to choose!  We'll definitely keep coming back for more.  Long live the Yeti!"}
{"text":"Best. Stuffed. Pizza. Ever!!! And we're from Chicago. We absolutely love their pizza, the stuffed is hands down amazing, the atmosphere and staff are great!!!"}
{"text":"It's to bad that they have lost the value of good customer service. My pizza was 40mins late.  I got a nice sorry about that. 
I called two times and they said it was on the way."}
{"text":"Sauce is a little spicy for my personal taste, the Yeti Spaghetti is unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"The Yeti can prepare traditional favorites but also some creative pies, as well as salads and other fare.  They do slices for your weekday lunch, or full pies any other time.  Dine-in, carryout, or delivery.  Great quirky theme and atmosphere, friendly service."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than they serve the best pizza  in Stoughton. Great crust, sweet sauce and if you're willing to make your meal even less healthy, try dipping a slice in their homemade ranch dressing. Sounds a little gross, but it's not. 

The staff is really laid back and friendly. Sometimes we joke that at times, they seem just as baked as they're pies, but they have never provided anything but exceptional service. 

Other menus items are really good, and the garlic bread is soaked with butter and is wonderfully bad for you. But we don't really give the other items a chance because we like the pepperoni pizza so much."}
{"text":"We use to love Yeti's pizza, but the last few times I have noticed the spice level has increased, their meatballs Where so spicy I didn't enjoy them, and my son who use to love their pizza now can't eat it because it's to spicy, kinda sad that my favorite pizza place in Stoughton isn't what it use to be"}
{"text":"Best food...
Great ambiance!
Amazing beers, and fair prices."}
{"text":"All I have to say is if you happen to be in the area and like spaghetti you have got to try their yetti spaghetti pizza. Two of my all time favorite foods combined perfectly. I loved it."}
{"text":"You know...I was kinda super excited to try Famous Yeti's pizza.   It sounded unique, I heard great things about it, and it was off the beaten path and almost hard to find (thank god I have GPS).   What started as excitement turned into....eh...it's ok.

No, I am not going to bash famous Yeti's for their pizza...it was good.   Was it the best....oh hell no. But, it was not bad and if I was in the area...would probably go order form time to time.  Order take out!

While I love the \"Yeti\" theme of the place and some of the funny decor...the atmosphere sucks donkey balls.  if you go in the summer and it is hot....be prepared to be hot since they have no air conditioning....or at least it was not on.   That makes for some not fun eating with the kids. On top of that the place needs a makeover and do not expect table serve or happy workers...they have no table service except bringing your pizza out to you and staff is rude, loud, and just ehhhhhhhh.

I feel bad because I know this is a small business owner just making pizza and trying to make it but when I cannot comfortably sit and eat, have a rude wait staff, and then it took forever for our food to arrive....just not willing to give a decent review.  

As I said..the pizza was good...the atmosphere sucked...I miss Marsala's Pizza in Stoughton."}
{"text":"We had heard some good things about this place....so we were excited.  However, it's sub-par at best.  Service was slow and rude....a rarity in this part of Wisconsin, and the pizza was edible but I don't understand why people think it's that good.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh my God, really good. We ordered the Yeti Speghetti stuffed Pizza and a thin crust pepperoni. Both were great.  Light crispy crust, great sauce, fresh stringy cheese. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"this is an amazing find with specialty pizzas with a unique ingrediants.  The staff and services is amazing, always going the extra mile to make the experience a posative."}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza.  its a very original menu with some unusual creations (my favorite is Yeti Spaghetti) but even a simple \"create your own\" is special thanks to the sauce and the crust.  Plus, the people who work there are awesome.  After just a few visits, the owner will be greeting you by name.  Its the kind of local business that gives our town personality.   We usually do carryout, but it also has a cozy, comfortable, dine-in area with a nice selection of area brews in bottles."}
{"text":"One word outstanding both the food and the customer service.  Order the cheese sticks they came with both pizza and ranch dipping sauces and plenty of them.  The cheese sticks are basically a cheese only 12 inch pizza.  We had the stuffed pizza and it was excellent.  We drove 2 hrs to try this and would do it again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best deep dish/stuffed pizza you will find outside of Chicago.  Their hand tossed and thin crust are also delicious!
Famous Yeti's is locally owned and you can tell they put a great deal of attention into making each pizza a unique and delicious experience.
Their pizzas include many house made recipes, it spoils you for the frozen stuff or the big chains. Crust, sauce, giardiniera, and sausage are all amazing recipes created by the the Yeti himself.
The menu is a treat to read - their pizzas, sandwiches, and salads all have unique yeti-themed names and a great description to go along with them.  I highly recommend checking the menu out just for laughs http://www.famousyetispizza.com/
This pizza is worth the drive to Stoughton, and a great treat if you are in town!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in town! Not even a question, go here if you want the best pizza! It never disappoints and the people are kind."}
{"text":"Had the Yeti Spaghetti and it was amazing. I was invited to join some folks coming in from Madison to try this pie (I'm from Stoughton but hadn't tried the place yet). While I'm not typically a spaghetti fan, I loved this pizza. Loved it loved it. I'm glad we have this in our town. We need more good restaurants like this. Planning on inviting some folks to come on out and share another with me in a few weeks. Can't wait to share this with people who love food. Great job Yeti!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but my sandwich was slightly over-crisped. Maybe some people like it that way. Takeout was brisk on Saturday night. Fabulous menu includes deep dish stuffed pizza. No single slices on weekends, and smallest pizza is ten inches."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great staff! All around a great experience. It's hidden in a strip mall attached to a gas station. Who on earth would think this would have been one of my favorite pizza joints in the country? The flavors were amazing. Had the Guido and Zen Garden. I loved them both. I'll defiantly be back. Go try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza very authentic! 100% better then Pizza Hut. If you want pizza go here first!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the Madison area.  Homemade sausage, fresh veggies and friendly service.  A warning about the stuffed pizza, you better have a large group all with big appetites.  They are huge!  So far no one has finished the spaghetti stuffed pizza alone. 

Sandwiches are sharable and the lads are very fresh.  Dressing is made on premises by the owner.  

You can't go wrong with whatever you order!  You can take home a movie from their free shared movie library if you are staying home."}
{"text":"Ordered from there out of the blue finding them here on Yelp. I got a custom stuffed pizza and I couldn't be happier. Not only was the pizza a great value overall, but it was also really really good!

Btw, I'm from the Chicago area, so I've had a lot of great deep dish and stuffed pizza. This ranks up there with the best of them!"}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza and salad fare.  The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, service was friendly, reasonably priced...what else could we ask for?!  If you're in Stoughton, you should definitely stop in for a pizza pie."}
{"text":"Our first swing through FYP was a worthwhile investment of all, time-money-appetite. We enjoyed our pizza thoroughly, and will be sure to return again. Thanks FYP for bringing another great option to Stoughton!"}
{"text":"SO I had to update my review. There was a fire, that closed this place down for awhile. Since they reopened I have eaten there several times.  Their cheese bread is excellent. The handmade sausage is probably some of the best  I have had in recent memories. I really enjoy having this place two blocks away!"}
{"text":"Checked in to Yeti's for a slice for lunch. Immediately noticed the chill music and casual ambience. Had two slices of the vegetable - thin slice, big piece of cheese, mushrooms, artichoke, and feta. Their sauce had a bit of heat. A+ on food and setting"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com. Stoughton's best pizza. Garlic bread is the best I've ever had. Salads are fresh and offer a lot of variety. Owners and staff are all friendly and fun to talk with. Famous Yeti's has become a family tradition, my favorite pizza hands-down!"}
{"text":"Famous yeti AKA hidden gem. Picked this place to meet a friend at entirely based on Yelp reviews. We got there and it's sandwiched between a citgo and a liquor store...um...ook. We decided to give it a shot since neither of us were familiar with stoughton and we were so glad we did! 

The decor was hilarious, I haven't seen that much \"yeti\" decor since the Everest ride at Disney. It was unique to say the least and very fun. Tables and restroom were very clean. We had the stuffed yeti spaghetti pizza and the cheese bread. To be honest, the combination of spaghetti and pizza didn't work for me, but I have yet to stop thinking about what the garden or margarita stuffed pizzas might taste like (and will totally trek out there to try them). The cheese bread was delicious and reheated well. The beer was AWESOMEly priced! 3.50 for a spotted cow!? Yes please!

Finally the service....such nice guys! It's counter, but they were very patient and courteous to two twenty-somethings who caught up on life (very loudly at times) at one of their tables for three hours. 

I can't wait to bring my husband here in the future, it's great!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves in Stoughton & decided to give Famous Yeti's a try. So glad we did! The food was fantastic!! We ordered a small Marco Polo salad & a 10\" Spaghetti Yeti for the two of us. We had plenty of leftovers! The salad was amazing, a small would be a meal in itself but we shared. The pizza was perfect. The sauce had a slight spicy kick to it and the crust was excellent. 
I highly recommend giving this place a try. Well worth the drive if you live in Madison."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time on \"two slice Tuesday\" and it was the most magical pizza I have ever eaten. The sauce is super unique and a little peppery I loved it. Defiantly wish i would have gotten more than 2 slices. I would recommend getting the pink lemonade with your pizza. So magical."}
{"text":"Two words: Yeti Spaghetti. 

The Yeti Spaghetti is one of the craziest pizzas I've ever had. Spaghetti, small and flavorful meatballs, and a spicy sauce get wrapped up in a crust galette style and then topped with a layer of melty, browned cheese. The spicy sauce is everything - it gives it the kick that keeps it from being too heavy. 

I've had this pizza a couple of times as a to-go order and am still shocked by its heft when I pick up the box. It takes about 30 minutes to prepare which is perfect for the drive from Madison. The large is truly a ton of food - a small is enough for two people with leftovers; the large will feed two people for days. 

The interior of the shop is cute if small - I've never dined in so I can't speak to service, but the counter workers are always kind and have me in and out in a few minutes. 

Someday I'll have to branch out and try another pizza, but it's hard to turn down this delicious spaghetti monster."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Stoughton period!  Ingredients are fresh and high quality.  We usually always get it delivered and they always come within their time window.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place! We've had their stuffed pizzas, delish, handtossed with supreme toppings, amazing, and thin crust, so good! I recommend their garlic bread (seriously the goop is that amazing) and or cheese bread."}
{"text":"Stuffed pizza is delicious and fast. It's like two crusts with tons of stuff loaded between. Different from stuff crust. Good prices too. Six tables to sit at but decent soft jazz type music"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Had the stuffed pizza, and it was extremely flavorful and delicious. Definitely will be ordering again when up in WI."}
{"text":"I crave their pizza all the time! The crust is amazing and every pie we have had has always been nothing short of heavenly. Staff is always nice and take out orders always prompt and accurate. LOVE the yeti!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!!!!!! 

Never had a bad experience. The staff is always efficient and friendly!

You really cannot go wrong ordering your pizza from Kale and the rest of the Yeti's crew."}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING place to gut pizza. And they even rent movies out of the store as well! Neat.  The only downfall is that they do not serve single slices after 2pm. Which is normal, but there needs to be more piazza places that sell by the slice in Stoughton and yeti's would be genius to make that an all day thing.!!"}
{"text":"SIMPLY FRESH...!!
   So much flavor can only come from fresh ingredients.  
   I got the Bumble's Best deep dish pizza..... and it did not disappoint at all!!
 
   I was stuck at a truck stop waiting for the snow storm to pass over. I pre-ordered the pizza but I did not have a ride to pick up and I was too far for delivery.     I struggle to get an Uber or a taxi ride out to get the pizza.  When the pizza was done the guys took pity on me and delivered the pizza (6 miles away from their location) to me.  I happily compensated the driver for delivering pizza in such hazardous weather.

     I wanted to eat the whole pizza but could only take three quarters.  Normally my body would make me regret for eating so much.... but not this time.   Which tells me they took the time and care to do it right (FRESH Ingredientsand not excessively greasy)...
      I imagine that's why they would rather risk driving through bad weather then to see an Awesome Pizza go to waste.

    Thank you Guys at  Famous Yeti's Pizza!!
You made my day..!!"}
{"text":"There pizza was amazing!  We're new to the area and ordered delivery.  We got a thin crust topped with red peppers, green peppers, banana peppers, and pepperoni.  Amazing!  We'll definitely be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good.  I am a big fan of the crust and the sauce on these pies.  The option of giardenera is a nice spicey one.  My only knock was they don't use kalamata olives in the Greek salad.  The stuffed pies look unique and challenging.  I will have to try one next."}
{"text":"I like their pizza. But honestly I really love their meatball grinder. It's delicious and HUGE. The Caesar salad is also very tasty."}
