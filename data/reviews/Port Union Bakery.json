{"text":"This is such a nice bakery on Port union road, and has the best no fuss coffee. ( To me). They re donuts are nothing like anything you get at a Timmys, starbucks, country style, anywhere but a small bakery that makes they re own donuts. They re a bit crispy, even the yeast donuts, but not stale, Ive never had a stale donut from this place. They re a good size, and they re cheap.  .  Now they re coffee, its just really good simple coffee!. I have no idea if its fair trade or any of that and really I dont care, its always fresh, and never burnt tasting. I cant go on about coffee because I dont know all the fancy lingo people used to describe it, but its GOOD!."}
{"text":"It's great having this little bakery in the neighborhood! It's our one stop shop to pick up a loaf of bread, some hot dog buns and pandesal. I really like their empanadas and ensaymada as well. I really have to lay off their little cakes and donuts though.  The little store front is very functional, but they really should spruce up the joint."}
{"text":"This is an amazing bakery! Sandwiches or pastries, even donuts - you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this bakery!  It all started about a month ago which started with the donuts and since then I've tried just about everything the have...yummmyyy!!!  Even their day old muffins are very yummy and still tastes really fresh.  I've been going their 2 to 3 times a week to get their donut, Boston cream are my favourite, or their chocolate croissants ."}
{"text":"Port Union Bakery was one of those places, based on reviews, that I really wanted to like.  For one, it's a neighborhood joint, family run. Also, the thought of local fresh baked goods was alluring, as I am a fiend for carbs. And, it's only a 10 minute drive from where I live, so total score right?  Well, here are my thoughts. I headed out this morning around 11 am to grab a doughnut or two. Prime time for baked goods, I would hope. They had quite the variety: Chocolate Dip, Vanilla Dip, Sugar, Cinnamon/Sugar Twist, etc. All were yeast based I thought, or at least not cake doughnut-like.  I chose the Boston Cream, and Dutchie. They both had crumbly textures and were on the drier side. Disappointing :(  I had anticipated the fluffy, chewy texture associated with a yeast doughnut, and was totally let down. May be they use baking powder/soda here instead? I don't know. Moreover, the vanilla pudding/custard/cream in the Boston Cream was spread sparingly. No squishy, gooey goodness here.  I hate to say it, as I am one to root for the underdog, but Tim Hortons has better.  I may return to try their Empanadas down the road."}
{"text":"My parents introduced me to this place. The donuts are the best and the dinners rolls are fantastic, yummy yummy"}
{"text":"This is a strong four! Great organic banana bread. I still want to try their apple bread."}
{"text":"I love their chicken and beef empanadas. First time I had them was back 2006 at my cousin's wedding. Whenever my cousins come visit me or vice versa these empanadas needs to come home with me.   One time thought it was way tooo much pepper."}
{"text":"I stopped in here while waiting for my colleague to drop his car off for service. It smelled god so I floated on in with the aroma of baked goods.  They must have just opened their doors because it was a little sparse on the product.  But that's ok.  I grabbed a donut.  Donuts make me happy. End of story"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts and very friendly service! Best kept secret at this place? Chicken empanadas! Delicious, flaky pastry encase a delectable meat filling. Two of these make a yummy and convenient lunch, specially when served with a salad or soup. They only have these mon-Saturday, and is often sold out in the afternoon."}
{"text":"I don't eat sweets and instead go here for the whole wheat bread and hamburger buns.  Simply the freshest fluffy whole wheat in the area."}
{"text":"I was in the area and I heard really good things about this place so I thought I would give it a try. Aww.....delicious I absolutely love this place. The donuts were to die for.  I mean literally if you eat too much you could die. I.really like the chocolate crossaint. The front desk was very friendly and patient. The parking wasnt too bad, just be careful cars are  crazy here.  There was a line up which tells me that if you go early you will get a better selection. I think I should avoid this place for my waist line but those pastries...my mind says I must go back!"}
{"text":"Port Union bakery is exactly what you would expect from your local bakery.  A small local bakery, that is.  They offer usual variety of breads (white, whole wheat and multi grain loaves, some buns and dinner rolls, banana bread...etc), small snacks like sausage rolls and Jamaican patties...etc) and pastries in a tiny 200 Sqft store with barely enough room to move around with a stroller.    Since the store is owned by Filipino people (I think), they also offer Ensaymada which I have yet to try but will update this review once I do.    What they offer is a good old basic staples so if you're craving a nice crusty baguette or a buttery flaky croissant, this place may not do it for you.  But for your everyday need for the basic stuff, you can be certain that you'll be served with a smile."}
{"text":"I've been eating food from here for over 10 years & I think it's worth checking out if you're in the area! It's a no frills kinda bakery. Nothing very fancy, take out only, kinda out dated. The people working here are very sweet & make some yummy food.   Best time to come is early in the morning to get it while it's still hot. My personal favourite thing they make are donuts! Super yummy! They also make awesome muffins, cookies, pudding, croissants! I'm personally not the biggest fan of the buns because they're a little sweet for my liking but my Mom adores them.   I'd stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I like their pandesal. It's always fresh when I buy it. I also like their chocolate chip cookie. It's a no frills bakery and family run. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Still 5-star worthy in 2014. I'm not here year-round, so I only get to check in a few times a year, but everything is as I remember in my last (more extensive) review.    As Vijaya notes in her review, the donuts are yeast variety, which I don't usually like because of their consistency (I usually prefer the denser cake-donut variety). But here they do something to give the very light donut a bit of a crunch. I put it down to \"magic\".  Vijaya also notes that the Boston creme filling is spread, not injected - I see this as preferable to a big glob in one quarter of the donut, because you get creme in every bite.  To each their own, I guess.   On my visits this summer, I was overjoyed to see BUTTER TARTS. I'd asked in prior years if they ever made them, and was told \"only around Christmas\", but by popular request they had them, and on special for $4.50 for 6!  These are not huge tarts, but they are excellent, and for comparable quality they would be twice the price at \"The Flaky Tart\" and other winning tart makers. I'm not a fan of raisins in my butter tarts, and P.U.B. makes them with and without, also a plus for me."}
{"text":"This was really close to a 5 star rating. My wife and I stopped in here because we needed some bread.  Our first time here we were pleasantly greeted by a lady behind the counter. We picked up our loaf and proceeded to check out the pastries and donuts.  I opted for a dutchie and my wife got a cheese Danish. The dutchie was *really* good it was just sweet enough and fresh. My wife loved her Danish, fresh and yummy. We also got 2 coffees to go. This was our only complaint I prefer a stronger coffee and this didn't cut it for me.  If the coffee was a bit better this would easily be a 5*.  Some of the baked treats we've had in a while. Great prices."}
