{"text":"This place is great!! Their food is excellent!!!    Some of my favs are the Red Chili Burrito enchilada style, Green Chili, Shredded Beef Tacos, Cheese enchiladas and their Cheeseburgers!!!  They also make these awesome Cheesecrisps with Red or Green Chili (open or closed) that are YUMMY!  You have to stop by this restaurant and try it out!  It's in the downtown area of Buckeye but worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"First of all BIG shoutout to Joseph.  He is my man.  I love their food.  You can't go wrong with a number one combo, or a GCC, or both.  I have never received bad service there, they are GREAT!"}
{"text":"I Love tacos, but these tacos I could barley even swallow ! Nasty nasty nasty I was very disappointed . I will never go back ."}
{"text":"My husband wanted ground beef enchiladas and I suggested going to a new place. I looked online and the menu had ground beef. We walked in the waitress told us sit ianuwhere. We walked aimlessly to the back section and waited 5 minutes for chips. ( we just stood up to leave) my husband ordered his meal and the waiter Saud we don't have ground beef. I said your menu has it on 3 different itens. He Said We Aren't ALLOWED To substitute. So he ordered fish tacos and I got a taco grande. My chicken was from a can and was very dry with some lettuce, tomato and guac. $7! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"}
{"text":"Only giving one star because zero is not avail!!  Told it was excellent. Service absolutely sucked and we were ready to walk out after waiting so long when someone finally helped.  While eating, a roach crawled across the table and I almost threw up.  Stopped eating, paid the bill and NEVER returned!"}
{"text":"We came here for the 1st time. Our service was very good but the food was nasty! I ordered the carnitas which was on a skillet full of onions and a tiny bit of meat and tons of oil! So I payed $13.50 for a skillet of onions and oil! I would not recommend that dish for any one. Also they were completely out of chicken and steak.. Maybe we came in the wrong day idk but very doubtful will will return."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the food the first time I took a bite of tortilla chips and salsa. Boy did it burn (I'm a wimp), but in a really great way. I have eaten there about 6 times in the course of three years now as it is near where I sometimes work and I look forward to those opportunities. The only drawbacks are that the building is very old so it's kind of dirty inside, but not gross dirty just old building dirty. And when they are very busy you have a very hard time getting help, but overall the wait staff is friendly and prompt. They have TV's up in one half of the restaurant and the other half is nice and quiet, which I really like. They play traditional music, which I also like, even though I don't understand what they're saying. If you don't mind a place that is plain to look at but serves good food, then give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm here to visit from San Diego Ca... this is by no means Mexican food, the salsa takes like its,store bought, the chips as well.  I ordered carnitas plate and What I got was fajitas a bunch of saut√©ed onions with chunks of pork by no means carnitas....it too them an hour to serve us. Guacamole,  rice and beans nasty..Never comming here again.  Giving them a one star because there's no zero stars"}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped by this restuarant while driving back from Yuma to Phoenix.  The Pork Carnitas I had were well seasoned, coming on a cast iron skilled with grilled onions.  The sides were nothing exceptional, but on the key portion of the mean (the carnitas) the food excelled. My wife had the shrimp fajitas and given a generous portion of shrimp that she also thoroughly enjoyed. You have to go a bit out of your way if you traveling along I-10 or AZ 85 to get here, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place deserves an award for the most consistently awful service. I brought friends from abroad here and the waitress was so rude I was embarrassed. Another time we came and waited 40 minutes from the time we ordered (and nobody came to  give us drinks at all) and when we told them we were leaving, the food finally came out. No apology. I don't know how they stay in business. Their food isn't superb, the location isn't great, you would think they would go out of their way to make patrons come back."}
{"text":"I took a chance and stopped for lunch. I had two tacos and a cheese enchilada.  Service was perfect. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I am a bit of a salsa snob. While good, this food deserves a better salsa. I highly recommend stopping in for lunch. Nice authentic tacos and enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"We just moved to Buckeye and like to try out the local eateries and this was on our list.  When we walked in the lady at the register never looked up to greet us, she just told us to \"sit anywhere \".  Our waitress greeted us promptly and while not overly friendly,  she was efficient and attentive.  I ordered the chicken chimichanga that comes enchilada style. The plate arrived hot but the food was just warm. It was topped with guacamole and sour cream which I love, but there was probably a 1/2 a cup of each plopped on top! A chimichanga is supposed to be deep fried and this one was not deep fried and seemed like they just dunked it in some old oil!. The chicken inside was overly peppered with black pepper, but tasted ok. My husband had something with shrimp and he said it tasted like they took it out of the freezer, rinsed it and threw it in the dish.  It was not cooked. The chips and salsa were mediocre. So we can check this restaurant off our list and then cross it off as I don't think we will try it again."}
{"text":"I have heard how great this place was, so thought I would give it a try.  I have to say that the Green Chile Cheese Crisp is amazing, so simple and add some of their great salsa it is a winner.  However that being said, the place was a mess!  We were ignored the first 15 minutes we were there.  The restaurant is DIRTY. the tables the floors the walls just gross dirty.  The health department should shut them down just for that, can't imagine the kitchen!  If you were a fan of the tv show Will and Grace, you will be happy to know that Rosario has found work here, and she is just full of mean, no funny!  The food was bland, there was no seasoning at all that I could tell and it was all so mashed together on my plate I wasn't even sure what I was eating.  Brave it Once for the Green Chile Cheese Crisp then find a place that has some flavor, and that is clean!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic along with the chips and salsa. The service is good as well. The dining area is very open a lot more like a bar than a restaurant. It's a great place to go to watch the game and have some food and drinks. Their bar has a nice selection of hard liquor but only a couple beers on draft. Overall it's a decent experience for a decent price."}
{"text":"Best food around! The CGCC is by far my favorite.  Love that servers care to know your name.  It gets busy-so be patient-- it's definitely not a drive thru.  Love the relaxing vibe!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, their food is subpar and over priced. I think it's a 'either you love it or hate it' thing. The shredded chicken tastes re heated."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have ever had, or remember ever having"}
{"text":"The last time my sister visited we decided we want to try a place we had never been. This fit the bill as we have never eaten anything in Buckeye. It has the small town feel to it and the folks serving you are friendly. I remember the food was quite good, but no idea of what I ate. It is a place we would stop in if ever we find ourselves in fabulous downtown Buckeye again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! ! Passing thru,  and was craving some authentic mexican food.  Delicious! !"}
{"text":"Subpar food with mediocre pricing.  Food took too long, not worth the wait. Nothing to consider authentic Mexican nor southwestern."}
{"text":"I love going here... I haven't been in awhile.. But when I do go I always get the # 4 and it's my favorite...."}
{"text":"I've given this place three tries and what's weird is the rice and beans are good but everything else is below average at best. Usually it's the other way around.  I've had green chile twice and carnitas once. All three plates arrived quickly and hot, but they all lacked real flavor and authenticity.  Service is okay but you have to pay extra for a smile.  Last thing, the chips and salsa are good but aren't worth stopping in for.    After eating there a few more times I am updating my review.  Avoid the carnitas.  They are nothing better than cubed pork on a bed of grilled onions with pepper.  No sauce, no sides, nothing.    Everything else is okay.  But be cautious of ordering off the menu, at the very least ask how much they're going to charge you.  I special ordered a burrito and lunch cost me $18 with tip.  That's way too much."}
{"text":"Love this place. The service won't blow your mind but   the food is great.  It's the only reason I look fwd to driving into downtown Buckeye."}
{"text":"La Placita Cafe is a very large restaurant. I went in for lunch with a large group, and the atmosphere was alright - the eating area of the restaurant nicely decorated with traditional western settings, but the bathroom seemed old and a bit unsanitary.   Perhaps it was because we came in a large group, but the waiters not attentive. My water was never refilled, and the food came out a bit cold. Our tortilla chips were never refilled. As for the actual food, it not the best Mexican food that I've had; the tortilla shells of the tacos tasted dry and oily, the beef inside was tasteless, the rice and beans were too salty, and the enchilada... well, cafeteria-like.   Actually, La Plactia Cafe is great for large groups because the restaurant itself is huge and can hold lots of people. I would recommend calling ahead to place orders before coming in, though, because it might take a long time to prepare the food.   That being said, I probably won't come back unless an event or occasion is held here. I don't dislike this place; rather, it didn't strike me as anything better than \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"We went here on the night of the light parade.  Somewhat busy but it wasn't the first time Buckeye had a light parade.  They should have been more prepared.  We waited 30 minutes for our food.  The nacho supreme was horrible.  The meat must have been sitting out a while.  Never got my refill.  And the phone!  It was constantly ringing and nobody ever answered it!  I wanted to pull it out of the wall!  We've been here many times and many times we have sworn we would never go back.  Once in a while they get it right."}
{"text":"This place was straight up N.A.S.T.Y.  I am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals. I'm not a picky person. I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be edible....that was until today! I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore. I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table, I wasn't even willing to order something else. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here a long time, not because its the best, but because its close to work. Nothing has changed since they did the addition in the back, which was probably 2001. it's been around forever, and you can't go wrong with the classics. I recommend keeping it easy with a couple tacos, beans and rice."}
{"text":"2 stars all because the hot sauce sucks now. 2 stars: 1 for a Buckeye Icon and 1 for most of the food is not bad.  Service is bad and slow. Servers are not trained in good service skills. Dirt parking lot sucks, be carefull not fall into one of the holes. Hope you are not handicapted and have to use the bathroom.....it's outside and to the left, suprised the Building department OK'd this place."}
{"text":"Really like this place! All of the employees are always moving quickly and are very friendly. The food is very good and reasonably priced. The environment is casual and welcoming."}
{"text":"My friend was out here from Chicago and I decided to take her to La Placita, told er it was pretty good food, however while eating our chips and salsa there was a hair that got hung up on my chip and it just grossed us out. We let the server know and showed her and her response was \"do you want me to cancel your food so you can leave?\"  What kind of response is that?  No, I'm hungry and I came here to eat. So, she goes back to the kitchen after taking our salsa away. Brings out our food.  She asks if there is anything else we need. \"Yes! We would like some salsa.\"  She stood there and decided to get it from the front rather than the kitchen, she put it in a styrofoam cup, not sure how she expected us to continue dipping our chips but we had to pour the salsa into our tacos.  She disappeared and never came back to check on us once, someone else brought our bill and we were charged full price for our meal. No apology or anything to rectify the hair in our food.  Good service you would go the extra mile to make it right so your customers come back.  My friend spoke to the girl who brought our bill and told her what happened, she just said let me get your server, the same girl came back and said all she could do was take off 2 tacos, which is fine, it's something. But then to argue about the whole thing and it caused a scene in the dining area.  The manager nor the server who took our order never came out to deal with the mishap.   I am rather disappointed in how this was handled. Good management would come out, talk to your customer and do what you can to make your customers happy and encourage them to come back.   Now, I won't recommend nor take any friends or family there again.  Poor service, poor communication, and lack of professionalism."}
{"text":"Being from a large city, I have experienced great Mexican fare, and I would have thought that being so close to Mexico and having a large Mexican population, there would have been good Mexican food around here. That may be true, but I have to be honest and say that this place leaves much, possibly too much, to be desired in the realm of awesome eats.  Maybe it's that I walked into this restaurant with too high expectations that they were unable to live up to. Maybe the food wasn't that good. It is possible that both are correct. I am thinking the second statement was more accurate than the first.  I had the combo plate with twp tacos and an enchilada. I asked for steak tacos. I got tacos with thin strands of steak, similar top barbacoa, that weren't very flavorful and were somewhat dry.  The enchilada was covered in a kinda bland mole.  Service was decent. The food was passable, but not very good."}
{"text":"Wow, I brought my family here for dinner while visiting from Los Angeles.  I have to say that this restaurant has to have the worst service and food PERIOD.  WE waited over an hr for our order, and the orders were all wrong.   Not sure how this establishment stays in business.  Worst experience EVER."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am only giving 5 stars to one item: The Green Chili Cheese Crisp.  Having grown up in Buckeye, I have gone here more times than I can remember.  This place was praticially a weekly occurrence in my youth.  I have NEVER gotten anything different.  Yeah I am sure they have other food items, they may actually even be good, but they could never compare to my GCC.  I may have moved but my love for these amazingly juicy yet crispy pieces of heaven has not left.  Every time I go visit my parents I have to stop by.    Other than that, service is so so, either you get your food in a hurry or you don't get it at all.  You should probably ask for a to-go drink cup as the regular cups are as old as my grandma and look kind of gross.  Oh and all the art on the walls is for \"sale\" however when I tried to buy one once no one knew how much it was or who painted it so they couldn't sell it."}
{"text":"The food is awful and the service is slow. The carnitas are dry and tasteless and all onions. There are a hundred other mexican places better than this one in the valley, don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"This place is so so.  Ok food.  Ok atmosphere.  Just a decent restaurant in Buckeye."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here all the time! It is still my go to place. We tend to eat there about once a week. The staff is really nice and very accommodating to kids and families! They are very fast too! I like their green chili cheese crisp (GCC), a bean burrito enchilada style, and they have the best rice and beans! I love this place. But people who are not from Buckeye normally don't like it at first. However, from my perspective it's the best!"}
{"text":"Stay away!  Their green Chili Cheese crisp is just a flour tortilla with cheese and canned Ortega Chilis,  OMG their salsa was awful tasted burnt.  Menu was dirty and had left over rice and beans smeared all over pages.  My husband ordered the Beef taco Delux!   Ughghg super dry!  I had the three tacos with a chipotle sauce so gross!  Our bill was $49 Beer was cold glass had lipstick.  They need a dishwasher and a cook.  My advice go to Taco Bell and get a 6 pack of beer somewhere else!  The good reviews must be family!  This place bites"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful!  Terrible food!  The worst Mexican food I've had in years.    My wife and I ate here last Friday night.  There weren't many patrons inside when we got there.  (should have  tipped us off)    I ordered two beef enchiladas with a beef  taco, rice and beans.  Flavorless rice, beans were salty, the enchiladas had some kind of dense, stringy, beef-like, dry substance inside, with canned enchilada sauce.  Barely edible.  The taco was something I've only seen prepared similarly at  \"Jack-in-the box\".  They had deep fried a corn tortilla with a lump of dense, dry, meat-like substance inside.  (the same material as in the  enchiladas, apparently)  There was no cheese, lettuce or sauce in the taco.  No seasoning to the material inside, just a dry lump of meat-like substance inside a deep fried tough taco shell!  Horrible!   I don't know how they can serve food like this without knowing how bad it is! Doesn't the staff eat any of this?!   Unbelievable!    The one bright spot was our waitress, who was friendly and did a good job.  Our grandson got the hamburger, which was pretty good, so he was okay.  Pretty sad, when the only food we had that was decent for dinner, was a hamburger at a MEXICAN restaurant.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place.  The food is seriously that BAD!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Nothing special here! Lots of tvs to watch your favorite game. The place was fairly empty but plenty of space on a busy night."}
{"text":"I would give the food a 4.5 but the service a 1, so I'm giving an overall a 2.   Food- pretty good, salsa is great, this was our 1st time so we ordered #'s 1, 10, and 15. The tacos (beef) could use more seasoning and was a little bland, and there was so much lettuce on everything, it was a little ridiculous. Next time order with no lettuce. The rice and beans where the stars of the dishes, don't skip!  Service- I called in, waited 15 minutes and went in to get the food. There was no one working, just 2 kids that I assume are related to the owners running around. The phone was ringing non-stop and after about 15 minutes I had one of the boys get someone to help me. Even then I had to wait about 7 minutes for her to cash me out, then another 5 for the food. I was going to write this place off until I had the food, now I'll have to give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. Dey need to improve der service."}
{"text":"What a great place. Perfect ambiance for great casual Mexican food. The bartender made sure we we bring taken care of. When we finally sat down, our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. With a no rush atmosphere it was a perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"Okay, this is my hometown Mexican food restaurant.  I have eaten this food all my life and I grew up less than a block from the original owners, The Amabisca Family.  That said, it's not gourmet Mexican food, but it's good enough for me.    In fact it's good enough to make me crave it a few times a year when I drive back out to the homestead to check on my parents and the rest of the relatives.  Specifically I crave their shredded beef taco plate with sides of rice and beans.  Oh man, I dunno what it is about their oily, salty, shredded beef tacos with beans and rice, but I love them.  And they also have a very unusual hot sauce that they serve with their chips, that I *swear* has oregano in it (and I like it) but it's definitely an acquired taste.  And another thing they make here that is amazing is their Green Chili Cheese Crisp.  So damn good!  So, this is a decent little place for *Americanized* Mexican food, UNLESS of course you are a bone fide food snob, in which case don't bother because you'll probably just decide you hated it as you pull out of the parking lot, sneering at the little town of Buckeye as you screech away towards the I-10 cursing the Food Gods that somehow misdirected you here in the first place..."}
