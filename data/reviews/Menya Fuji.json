{"text":"One of tbe best ramen restaurants around. Better than Kinton, the broth is very rich and less oily. Portion and prices are decent. Only problem is it's right at Yonge and Finch, so parking is going to be a problem."}
{"text":"Menya Fuji is conveniently located on the intersection of Yonge and Finch. It offers not only traditional Japanese ramen, but also special and unique dishes, such as Fuji Mountain Ramen, that you won't find in other Ramen restaurants. 

Food: 
I tried Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and Cold Vegetable Soba Ramen.
-Cold Vegetable Soba Ramen: It's surprisingly very refreshing. If you are a vegetarian, or wants something light and refreshing, this is it. Most of all, you won't feel guilty finishing the whole bowl. 
-Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (with sweet corn): Chashu on top of ramen has a full fire flavor. Unlike other Ramen restaurants, Menya Fuji's soup base is light and leaves clean after taste; it's not oily and thick. But, it also has rich and full flavor of pork bones. 

Service:
- Staffs are very attentive and friendly. They are always nearby to make up to customers' requirements. I did not find a single problem with staffs. 

Atmosphere:
- It's like a cute little button in the neighborhood. Woody interior delivers the warm feeling. It's almost like a late night small eatery in Shinjuku Omoide Yokocho in Tokyo. Since it's a small place, it's best to make a reservation for party of 4 or more. 

If you are looking for a decent bowl of Japanese ramen to warm your body, Menya Fuji is the right place to pay a visit this winter.

{"text":"I am not a big fan of ramen but I have been to the place twice , both time was very pleasant! I love the broth and curly chewy thick noodle. I had shoyu ramen and miso ramen, and I liked both of my them! The place is very clean , service  as was very delightful! I always had water and hot tea in my cup. I know one of the server is Chinese , and heard that one of the owners is from Japan. Chef Fuji has a very interesting background and experience! I just can't wait to try more of his creations!"}
{"text":"Since I walked in the staff greeted us friendly with a smile. The atmosphere is great as well as the music. Food is of best quality and very delicious. And yes, they got a really nice green tea. Thank you Menya Ramen! See you next time!!!
 \(**)/"}
{"text":"It was ok, maybe related to what I got. I tried the Fuji mountain ramen cause it looked cool with everything piling up. There were about 3 pieces of pork chashu, 2 boneless chicken karaage, and 2 half pieces of the soy egg. The noodles would be about the same as other ramen then the filler was all cabbage and bean sprouts with some broccoli as well.  Took so long to get thru cabbage, I just moved it to the side eventually, can't eat that much cabbage or bean sprouts...the soup base was ok."}
{"text":"Recently tried out this ramen joint near Yonge and Finch. I had the Tonkatsu ramen and thought it was great. Not too salty, just right. Also tried the karaage as a snack. It came in a generous portion, hot and crispy. Definitely hit the spot on a cold winter night. The house lychee sake was also good - came with a lychee fruit in the cup! Would come back again for some ramen."}
{"text":"It's okay. I had the $19 menya ramen special which in my opinion was a large portion but consisted of mostly bean sprouts and was hard to eat cause I was digging for the noodles the whole time without eating everything on top. My favourite thing ever in ramen is corn.. but the corn in the bowl was tasteless and not sweet. The soup base was average.. I was a bit confused with the vibe of the restaurant because of the playlist of random kpop and mando songs lol... overall an average experience and none of which reminded me of a bowl of Japanese ramen (safe to assume they were going for this, right?) I didn't try anything else so, this was based off of a one time visit on a quiet evening. Nothing bad to say about the service."}
{"text":"Ramen is really good! It definitely is one of the best ramen restaurants in town! 

The ice cream is amazing!! I got the sesame and matcha green tea. It is definitely premium quality!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good, and my standard for ramen is pretty high. I had the tonkotsu ramen and my girlfriend had the spicy miso one. She's a spice fiend and was surprised that she didn't need more hot sauce to add to the taste.

I do recommend this place and it's still new so not that many people. I really recommend it if you want good ramen that's not a hot oily mess.

New go to place maybe :D"}
{"text":"The soup was perfect, not too salty as compared with some of the other popular ones.  It's very flavourful and not too oily at the same time.  The portion could be a little bigger, next time I'm definitely getting some extra noodle next time.  To be honest, without appetizers, I would still be hungry after the ramen.  Also a little bit more generous on the pork would be better, I think the noodle I got came with only two pieces.  Also I added extra sweet corn and couldn't find many in my soup.  

Limited selection of ramen, wish there were a bit more choices.

There is no parking basically, street parking on Yonge street and then walk to the restaurant but that's with any other restaurant around Yonge and Finch area.  There is a tiny parking lot right beside the restaurant that's got like 4 parking spots and it's tiny, go park somewhere.

Service good, restaurant is very small but clean."}
{"text":"Dropped by after work since it is within walking distance from Finch station. Its a very small quaint restaurant with the rustic feel. 

Food:
Tried their ramen and it can come with a small karage don if you add $2 or $3.  The ramen texture was okay with some accessory ingredients. The broth was so so....Nothing spectacular. The chicken karage was good, nice and crispy with moist chicken inside. 

Atmosphere:
Service was good and food came out fast."}
{"text":"Small cozy simple fast - perfect for grab a bowel of noodle. Very taste we had the black soup can add veg which I really like the flexibility. Match cheese cake a little bit heavy at my taste, as it actually taste like a North American cake. Love the wood spoon and small wood chair. Ordered fry octopus ball very taste"}
{"text":"Service was good.
Food was average - broth was too salty for my taste.
Will I return? Not really. Doesnt stand out much from other ramen places. But the location is really good - close to ttc station and its right near the major intersection - yonge and finch."}
{"text":"A cute little ramen shop right at the corner of Yonge & Finch. I was drawn-in by the Fuji Mountain Ramen, as the pictures look amazing. The taste, however, leaves a lot to desire. The broth is nice and nutty but a little flat on the depth of flavour. I was expecting more. We also ordered the chicken karaage and it was pretty good. 

I made the mistake of ordering takoyaki and it was repulsive. When I bit into it, the octopus inside was still frozen--disgusting. 

Sadly, there are better ramen shops in the area and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Got take out from here for dinner; ordered over the phone for pick-up. I knew they had the option for vegetarian broth, and being a vegetarian that was a huge appeal. They were patient in explaining the ingredients and toppings/options for vegetarian bowl over the phone. Ended up ordering their regular vegetarian ramen bowl with extra spice (which they charge an extra $1 for [worth it; it was spicy!!]) Veg ramen bowl includes scallions, tofu, mushrooms, bok choy, corn, half boiled egg, mushroom broth and noodles. The portion was a pretty good size for 1 person. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the toppings that the bowl comes with is fairly little. Even though the bowl with the broth and noodles is very filling, the toppings of corn, tofu etc are very scant. Would love it even more with some more of the delicious toppings!

Overall, definitely a great go-to place for me for those ramen cravings."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service! 

Portions may be a bit small for some people. 
It's a small restaurant so it can't seat too many people. Seating-wise, the design is similar to other ramen places. If you like your personal space, gg.

When I went, it was cash only (their card terminal isn't set up yet) -- make sure you bring cash. If anything, there's a TD bank with atm across the street where Starbucks is.

They also have \"ramen of the day happy hour\" which is 3pm - 5pm Monday through Friday. It's 50% off then.

Would I go back? Yea."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for a bowl of ramen. I ordered the Fuji Mountain Ramen. It had three thick slices of chashu (seasoned pork), two giant pieces of karaage (deep fried chicken), a soft-boiled egg, and healthy amount of veggies, all on top of noodles and miso soup. I enjoyed the amount of meat I got from this dish. But to me, the soup was mild and it felt like the noodles were only a sidekick. I would have liked a more powerful soup. I got 15% discount for posting my photo on the web. Based on my experience, I felt the discounted price was just right.
This place is in a very convenient location. I may come back for a second visit, to confirm that my first impression was correct."}
{"text":"i love this place, to me i think it is underrated comepare to other Ramen places. i ALWAYS GET the fuji mountain. 

The fried chicken still cripsy and moist inside. For me i always add black garlic oil in it for that extra flavour booost
would recommending trying.."}
{"text":"I like the space, not big but not tight...servers were attentive since I walked in and the shio ramen hit the spot.  My kind of comfort food truly"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good ramen. Hits the spot flavour- and portion-wise. Also love the authentic feel and decor of this small shop. My new go-to for ramen breakfast."}
{"text":"Cute little ramen place near Yonge and Finch. The service is friendly and attentive. They currently have a lunch time special for Asahi: $3.90 from 11:30-3pm. I got the spicy miso ramen ($12.95) which they made mild for me, otherwise is would've been too spicy. Mine was made perfectly though, just the right amount of spice but still really flavourful. The chashu is smaller than I'm used to, but it was tender and smoky. I ended up getting extra noodles ($2), it was that enjoyable.

Right now, if you tag their food on Instagram or Facebook and share location, you get %10 off. It's conveniently located for me, so I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered a Fuji Mountain Ramen which is huge. The ramen came with a lot of meat. It came with two pieces of chicken karage and four pieces of chashu. The chashu is very good, the chef torched the surface but the chicken karage tasted too salty to me personally. The ramen itself is the thick noodle which is ok to me. The bowl also has other vegetables, like sprouts, broccoli, bamboo shoots and an egg in two halves. The soup of the noodle did not taste like authentic boiled for several hours but the kind that made with seasoning powder. 

There is a lunch special going on right now that you can order a glass of Asahi at $3.90 together with a bowl of ramen. This is quite a good deal. There is another promotion for limited time only that you can get 10% off if you post the pictures of your meal on Instagram or Facebook."}
{"text":"Came at lunch hour for a quick meal. Fast service, and good meal. The tonkatsu shio soup base was very creamy and delicious. For $10.95, this meal was worth it, with 2 slices of chasu, half an egg, and some bamboo shoot.  Post a picture on instagram (You got to tag their account!) for 10% discount. 

Wifi is available, ask waitress for password."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fuji ramen- $19.85. That's really expensive for a bowl of ramen... you get the same amount of ramen as any other bowl but its filled with meat. There were 2 big pieces of karage (fried chicken), and around 5-6 slices of pork belly. There are also A LOT of bean sprouts. After eating all the meat, you are basically left with eating bean sprouts and ramen together..
The flavour was fine but I don't think this ramen is worth $20 :(

They charge $2 for hot tea without telling you!"}
{"text":"This place is so overrated. The fried chicken is neither crispy or juicy. I ordered the spicy ramen, it is very salty! And nothing special. I also ordered the takoyaki, nothing special again. 

Even though I just live 2 minutes away from this restaurant I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Another ramen shop popped up in the Finch/Yonge area. Sadly I can't see this place competing with Sansotei just a few streets down.  It's certainly an alternative if Sansotei is crazy busy.  Server informed me they are giving a 15% discount off food only as a grand opening special but on the bill it works out to be really 9%.  Don't know if this was an honest mistake or just misleading customers. Either way it's not a good first impression.  Debit system not in place yet so only accepting cash presently.

I tried the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen which is smaller than normal.  Pretty standard toppings of chashu, negi, egg and bamboo shoots.  The wavy thick noodles were alright as well.  However, the broth I found was overly salty and very oily like an Exxon Valdez disaster.  I tried to mix everything around but the layer of oil just wouldn't go away.  To be fair, it is a newly opened restaurant and they probably haven't had the time to develop an outstanding product or learn math.  Will give them another try at a much, much later date if they're still around."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5 stars

Location/Service
At the corner of Yonge and Finch - to be exact it's at the south-east corner of a small plaza.
It's not a big restaurant - probably fit around 20-30 people with tables available for small groups as well.
I like their decor of wooden tables/stools/chairs, giving a local Japanese ramen boxy feeling.
Staff were also friendly and fast with service.

Food
I came here for a quick lunch so the only item I tried was their Shio Ramen (around $11.50).
Portion wise was a little smaller than expected. But the broth was pretty nice and flavorful. It had bamboo shoots, soft boiled egg and char su (pork belly). The egg and pork was done to the right level. Noodles were also chewy and not too soft (although it would be nice if they had noodle options to choose from).

They do serve other small snacks and offer cold noodle (not sure if it will change for the winter). It's a nice place to swing by for a quick bite or have a comfort feeling on a chilly day."}
{"text":"Love their thick aldente noodles. Broth was a little salty for me which I think is because of the dried shrimp. Aburi pork belly was good. Egg was a bit overcooked. But you must get their chicken karaage, they have a spicy version too (not really spicy though)."}
{"text":"Boasting as authentic Tokyo style ramen, I had high hopes. But really - it's just your usual bowl of tonkotsu ramen. Prices are average, though add-ins seem steep. The shop is clean, well-lit, and overall quite comfortable! You'll see a sign on the table for 10% off if you post a photo of their food on Instagram of Facebook and tag them, so feel free.

My table ordered the karaage and spicy karaage - they arrived at the same time and we discovered the only difference was the mayo on top. This was disappointing, there's no additional spice tossed on the fried chicken for the spicy one, and the spicy mayo was not all that interesting - it's the same kind you get on a spicy maki roll. There were perfectly four pieces of chicken, and for what it was I didn't want to pay $4.90.

I ordered the tonkotsu shoyu ramen with corn added and cheese. I was happy to receive my cheese served separately in a small bowl, and the portion was well-sized and almost generous. The tonkotsu broth is nothing to write home about, and the ramen is as expected. The egg was not flavourful and was a little too raw in my opinion, which deducted points. My friends ordered the spicy tonkotsu at a $2 premium, and they all said it was almost too spicy. They're normally medium-hot wing eaters at places like All Star or Wild Wings, so I was surprised they felt so overheated! They said the spice overshadowed the rest of the broth's flavour, and nobody had any comments beyond \"spicy\" that were of note.

If you're in the area, I recommend taking the extra 3-5min walk to Sansotei on Byng Avenue. Not sure if everyone is just hyped about a new ramen shop, but I really didn't feel anything special about their noodles here! Glad to see a decent food spot though, hopefully they'll up their game with some more time and join the myriad of great restaurants at Yonge and Finch."}
{"text":"Little Shop, Big Taste! We found this little gem by accident as we walked around this busy busy intersection. What a find though...
We had the Mount Fuji Ramen and Shoyu Ramen. --
The Shoyu ramen was delicious. The saltiness level was just right. Not like someother places that just load up the salt and fat. Soup was good. You can tell the broth was something they took a lot of care in making. It was like liquified bone; all flavors in.
The Mount Fuji ramen has a good portion. It's a miso based soup with a healthy serving of karage fried chicken plus one of the best chasu pork cutlet I've ever tasted. Omg, its so juicy and the soup is so savory! Noodle itself is just as good as any other. What really makes it pop though is the combination on everything.  Its a tad pricy but totally worth.

Decore was ok. Looks like they are still working on it. But clear signs of going in the right direction. Not bad for a couple of weeks in.

Food: 10/10 (best ramen i have had in a while.)
Location: 10/10 (so convinent. There is also free parking around the corner )
Service: 9/10 (gr8 service. Nothing much to say there)"}
{"text":"An awesome addition to the food culture at Yonge and finch! I strongly recommend the Karaage Don + Takoyaki."}
{"text":"Started with the fried chicken. It was awesome. Make sure to order from the black menu for a unique taste. The service was also quick and very friendly. Went for lunch on Saturday. We were the only ones here. Come support this place :)"}
{"text":"Saw this on the drive home. Decided to give it a try. It's currently a soft opening, so cash only for now. Had the karaage and shio ramen.  Broth was rich and noodles just the right firmness. Chicken was crispy and tasty. Definitely will come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The restaurant deserves a 3.5 star rating, which is mostly driven by the amazing texture of their noodles. 

From the exterior, the design of the restaurant signage reminded me of Chinatown so I wouldn't have guessed that this was a ramen joint without discovering it on Yelp. 

We ordered a Mazesoba Ramen ($11.95) and this variation came without soup. The toppings included diced torched chashu, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, scallions, and half of a marinated soft boiled egg. I personally found the bonito powder infused sauce a bit on the salty side. This dish came with thick noodles, and they were made and cooked to perfection. It's been a very long time since I have had ramen noodles of this quality. I asked the waitress if the noodles were made in house, and found out that they are actually imported from a supplier in Japan. 

My husband ordered the Tonkotsu Shio Ramen ($10.95), which came with a dash of shrimp oil. Generally, we prefer our soup piping hot, but like most ramen joints, the soup was just hot enough to avoid overcooking the noodles. My husband didn't enjoy the addition of the shrimp oil as he felt it overpowered the pork bone soup, which lacked depth of flavour. However, like me, he raved about the texture of the thin noodles. 

Even though the sauces and soups didn't quite hit the spot, we would definitely return just for the noodles. It was just that good. 

We finished off our meal with the taro ice cream ($2.9), which came with corn flakes, a surprisingly good combination.  I immediately recognized the flavour, and that the supplier is likely Ozawa, which sells it in 5 or 6 litre tubs.

As we paid for the bill, we were offered a coupon with a 10% discount for our next visit. Definitely a good way to entice patrons to return."}
{"text":"I tried their shoyo ramen during their soft opening. It was good. Just like other reviews, sansotei and other established ramen place is a tad better, but I still recommend this place. location is super convenient, its right across yonge and finch. Their spicy karage was delicious."}
{"text":"New(ish) ramen place right on Yonge and Finch, replacing an internet cafe. 
The decor is quite nice, and there are a number of seats available despite the small space.

The washrooms are located in the basement, but it is also well designed down there. Much better than most basement washrooms.

Service is alright. Refills on water come frequently.

Ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with an order of takoyaki and karaage with sauce on the side.

The ramen was ok. The noodles had a nice texture: not too soggy, not too hard. They didn't have as much flavour as I was hoping from the broth, though I found the broth to be not as rich either. It was a bit watery, halfway between soup and the kind of broth you find in some other ramen places like sansotei or kinton. The chashu was thin and small, but was easy to chew. Would probably get ramen elsewhere given the options in the area.

The karaage comes with 4 pieces. They were nice and juicy, with crispy breading. The breading was not too thick, though I found the karaage to be a bit inconsistent in size.

The takoyaki came with 5 pieces. Unfortunately, there was one small piece of octopus inside and overall kind of flavourless.

Someone had ordered a small karaage don for $3.90, which comes with 3 pieces of karaage! Literally, half the bowl was chicken! If you're looking for something small with lots of protein, that is not a bad choice! I would probably come just for that.

Tea is offered at a $2 charge. A lot of japanese places I've been don't charge for tea, whether they are chinese-owned or otherwise. They have nice glasses for their water though

One of the waitresses spoke to us in mandarin at some point by accident, probably because everyone looked chinese, which is fine. But some people might be caught off-guard.

We went on Jul 13 and was informed of a 15% discount if we post about the place on social media, and that their card systems were not working yet and therefore cash-only. It seems like someone else had a bad experience with the discount not actually being 15%, but we were given the correct amount."}
{"text":"Ordered the mountain ramen and a beef with rice. The 4 star is for the ramen cause the rice is not that good. 
Ramen was cooked perfectly not too soft or too hard. 
If you are sharing the mountain ramen it comes with a lot of bean sprout and not as much noodles. Soup base was good that can compare with the ones in Japan. 
The cha siu is well cooked and torched that makes it very tasty. Chicken karage was also very good and juicy. 
Overall for the price is much better than other ramen place cause lots of places only give u 1 piece of cha siu that's it and paying for the amount of money. Worth it to give it a try when around the area not order the rice ."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday evening to give this fairly new place a try. 
We ordered takoyaki, chicken karaage and of course some ramen and black sesame ice cream.
Everything was very tasty but as others have stated before me the ramen portion seems a bit smaller then what you usually get served at other ramen places. 
The ramen comes in a bowl that is pretty pointy/narrow towards the bottom. Almost like a cone with a wider top. I could eat easily two of those.

The interior design is nice and simple, the food was quickly served and the service was ok, too. 

We may go back but at this moment it is not my favourite ramen place."}
{"text":"I've never been here. Yelp won't let me leave this page unless I type a review and hit continue. I've never even heard of the place but most japanese food is really good so 3 stars! Yay!"}
{"text":"I tried the tonkotsu shio ramen. First impression is how small the bowl was! Be prepared for smaller portions compared to other ramen joints.

Broth isn't the rich and creamy kind which is what I prefer. It didn't have as much depth and flavor compared to sansotei or kinton. It's VERY salty too, I drank 3 glasses of water to go with it!

Noodles are chewy and al dente which I liked a lot, probably one of the better ramen noodles I've eaten.

Toppings included only half an egg *why not a full one? :( 2 slices of pork belly was pretty good, slightly charred. Bamboo shoots were bad, tasted just like those Chinese pickled shoots from a jar.

I'd say give this place a try, but I'm personally not a fan and would rather go to the other ramen places in the area."}
{"text":"The staff are quite attentive as I visited Menya Fuji on a Friday during lunch, and the tables were quite full. Luckily, I only needed a table for 1, and was seated immediately.

I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen ($12.95). I found the soup base to be spicy and flavourful, while the noodle texture was al dente. 

Currently, they're doing a soft opening with 15% off if you post an image on any social media site and tag them. 

The restaurant is also cash only and no take outs, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"I was an eager beaver when it came to testing out Menya Fuji.  Finch Station is my main hub for going to and fro from work, so I often stopped in front of the restaurant to see when its construction was done.  It started operating recently and its reviews on Yelp are stellar; 4 and 5 star reviews dot the business page with raves about the flavourful broth.  Unsurprisingly, my friends and I organized a small meet-up for dinner here two nights ago to give the food a whirl.

The service here is quick.  The servers even talk quickly and in a pointed way in order to hop from diner to diner.  This was not off-putting.  Rather, I appreciated the efficiency of their work.  The interior design of the establishment is eye-catching as well, with its brown, red, and black colour scheme.  If you've ever been to Donburi in Markham, you will definitely see the similarity between the two restaurants.  As for the food, however, I will be frank:  It just didn't cut it.  Even tea wasn't free.  

We ordered the following:

- Takoyaki:  It came with 5 pieces, which is an average amount for the price.  The texture was confusing in laymen's terms because the filling was chewy rather than having the usual \"doughy/goopey-ness\".  The flavour was even more peculiar with its lack of any real flavour at all, save for a solitary piece of octopus inside. 

- Karaage (fried chicken):  This was pleasant.  The breading was neither too thick nor too thin and was subtly spiced.  The meat was juicy and boneless, which is my preference.  I eat \"chimaek\" (Korean fried chicken and beer) regularly and I wouldn't have minded just eating their karaage with a pint of Sapporo.  

- Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen:  From other Yelpers, I had heard that the broth of their ramen can be quite oily.  I honestly believe that may have resulted from them choosing to try the spicy and miso varieties on their first time here.  As such, I opted for the shoyu ramen because it would contain their simplest broth.  The broth was quite salty, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to what's served at large chains like Kinton Ramen.  It had strong flavours and I could see myself enjoying this quite a bit despite not liking high-sodium foods.  The caveat however, was everything else!  The noodles, albeit having a nice firmness, was average and all the toppings were minuscule compared to what I'm used to receiving at other ramen restaurants.  Even the portion size was small, though I think the amount of noodles was average, so it's possible that they just use less broth, thereby making their ramen seemingly smaller.

If you're on a ramen crawl in the area, I would recommend you to give Menya Fuji a try, but in all fairness, there are other better competitors in the area."}
{"text":"Ramen was flavourful and full of meat. For the price and the size it's very reasonable. The ambiance and setting fits the ramen resto. theme. Definitely would go back to try the cold noodles next. This time I had the mount fuji and shisho.."}
{"text":"4 stars.

I'm always down to trying new ramen shops and this one happened to opened right at the corner of Finch.

I had the Tonkotsu Shio with extra chashu and my bf had the Fuji bowl - beware this is a huge portion so if you're feeling super hungry try this one! The Fuji ramen bowl consists of two pieces of kaarage, 4 pieces of chashu, some broccoli with a whole lot of cabbage and bean sprouts.

I found my broth to be just right, not too salty like some places. It was the perfect bowl for me, again if you're feeling really hungry, try the Fuji ramen bowl. It's about $20!

The service here is pretty quick, we didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive even though the place was quite busy so that was good. Give it a try if you're down for some place new!"}
{"text":"Came back again to give this ramen place a second chance. At night time, there is LED lights, I wasn't too comfortable. Then the noodle, I am never full after eating the bowl. I had to go get snack from the Korean truck down the street. 

They still haven't fixed the machine and it's cash only. Next time I will go back to my regular ramen place down the street with better flavour and portion."}
{"text":"good toppings. service is quick and fast. great place to grab a quick bite with a group of friends. noodles kinda seem to be the only thing I can really complain about. prices are good and the menu is very simple"}
{"text":"Came here to try out all the new ramen places near Yonge and Finch area. So I started with this place as it is closest to subway station. I walked in, the restaurant is small and it's a bit darker on the decor. Also, they got these wooden stools that tries to imitate a Japanese ramen store looks like. (I haven't been to Japan yet, just an observation from all those travel shows). FYI, mind your first step after walking in thru the glass doors. 

So I sat down, and started browsing their menu. They got about two handful of choices. This, I like. There isn't an over abundant amount of choices thrown at you. Which also means they are good at these specific dishes. So I've settled for the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen with a side option of Chicken Karaage don. (By the end, I had to say this was a good choice as one bowl of noodle is usually not enough for me). My friend ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu ramen (not in picture). We waited for a bit and the Chicken Karaage Don came out first. Not long after, the ramen bowls came out. At first I took a sip of the soup and it's not too salty. However, compare to other ramen stores, the soup isn't as rich as I like. That's okay, just an observation. The pork belly isn't bad. Overall, I think the experience is just okay. As for my friend's Spicy Tonkotsu, it's not as spicy as she likes also. So again, overall experience was okay. My Chicken Karaage Don ain't too bad, again the taste is also okay? So overall experience is okay. I like the location of this place, it is very convenient. 

Will I come back? I will see. Rating is a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Ramen here is actually pretty good.  Broth is tasty and the noodles were just the perfect texture.  I'm not sure why a few people gave low stars, but I personally find it as good or better than the other highly rated ramen places in the area.   I'll be back here often!"}
{"text":"Menya Fuji lives up to its claim of being as authentic as Tokyo ramen.  Although it is not exactly as good as ramen in Japan, it comes quite close.  Being a vegetarian as well, I didn't expect to find something unmodified on the menu that I could eat, but they surprised me with offering the Ramen Salad.

The noodles were thick and chewy, and the soft-boiled egg as cooked to perfection.  (I love a well-done soft-boiled egg).  The chill of the noodles were refreshing, especially mixed with their  Menya House dressing.  I can't say much for their meat-based ramens, but vegetarians, you will have at least one dish to try at this place!"}
{"text":"Great service!

Servers were very attentive and filled my water many times. 

We ordered the takoyaki, was very good. And for ramen we went with tonkatsu shio and tonkatsu shoyu. It was not bad. Soup base has a charcoal type flavour. Chasu was a little fatty for my taste. Serving was a little small. Will be back for a quick meal to try other things."}
{"text":"Menya Fuji is just beside the cash money east of yonge and Finch. My friends and I got here on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't too busy. I've come here before and this was consistent with that time as well and the review will consider the first time I attended as well.

We were greeted at the door and seated quickly. The restaurant was well kept and the lighting was not that bright. Right after we got the menu, I noticed that the cold veg soba ramen was discontinued. This was a set back because one of our friends was vegetarian and that was the only option on the menu. We consulted the waitress to confirm and she said that they will be introducing a new vegetarian broth starting January 2nd of the new year (I went at the very end of December 2017 so it should be available now). After hearing that the vegetarian main was unavailable, we decided to pack up to leave. BUT WAIT! Luckily that's not how the story ends, as the waitress came back from the kitchen after confirming that they had enough sauce to put together the last vegi soba bowl of the year which made my friend very happy and the rest of us as well given that it was freezing outside and it wouldn't have been fun finding another location in the cold. We ended up ordering the cold vegi soba, Fuji mountain ramen, tonkatsu shio ramen and the spicy karaage (fried chicken) as an appetizer. 

The cold vegi soba ramen ($11.95) was good, the sauce was flavourful and the different toppings (sweet corn, egg, cherry tomatoes,  and lettuce) added nice colour and texture. This was a broth-less ramen that relied heavily on the soba sauce, the noodles were great and not overcooked, and the eggs in all the dishes were cooked perfectly though the taste of marinade wasn't that prominent. I'd give this dish a 3.5/5. Next was the Fuji Mountain ramen ($19.95). This ramen looked amazing, but didn't taste that great. It was topped with slices of pork, karaage, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, sweet corn, scallions, and an egg. My friend mentioned that there was a lot of bean sprouts which made up the mountain part  and the price did seem reasonable considering the toppings. However, the broth was very disappointing, it was pretty bland which took away from the dish as a whole. Overall I'd give this ramen a 2.5/5 -though if you're hungry and wants something to fill you up, this is the one. The ramen I got was the tonkatsu shio ramen ($10.95), this was pretty good, but what makes the dish in my opinion is the shrimp oil they add onto the broth. That addition makes the whole broth taste much better and enhances the flavour profile of the whole ramen. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the egg was great and the bamboo shoots added a nice texture. The broth was not overly salty -though still on the salty side as it should be. It definitely wasn't overwhelming  towards  the end  as most ramen broths are so cleaning the bowl was really easy. The chashu wasn't anything special, though it wasn't bad either. Overall a 4/5. Finally the spicy karaage ($4.9), this wasn't that great, though the chicken was cooked thoroughly with some spice powder sprinkled on top, and the spicy mayo was good - but that should be standard. If it was freshly prepared then I feel like it would have definitely been better but the ones we got was cold and was probably just sitting there for a while. I'd give the karaage a 2/5.

Overall the service was consistently excellent both times that I've been here, and they also had a promo that's been going on for a while where you get 10% off if you take a picture and post either on Instagram or Facebook while tagging them and their hashtag. Look around when you get there to see if it's still available! I will come back for the shio and the mazesoba ramen (which I got the first time I came here) one day, and if you come here I'd recommend these two dishes as well!

Tip: there is a very small parking lot beside the restaurant, but you probably won't find a spot should you get there during peak hours."}
{"text":"It's a small and cozy ramen shop. Its compact, but it's comfortable enough. The seats are similar to those at other ramen shops (wooden box stools). 

The menu has a good selection of choices, but also keeps choices down so you're not overwhelmed with a million choices. I love menus like this, because typically this let's the cook focus on making those dishes well, and I can make a decision for what to eat easier. 

The ramen is really tasty. The noodles are a good thickness and are fresh. The broth is hot, rich and flavorful. Good portion size for the price. Lunch special has Asahi for $3.90 (cheap!!!) if you want a cold beer with your ramen. 

Service is quick from the servers. They are friendly and polite. In such a small shop, it's easy to get attention of the staff. 

It's a good choice if you're looking for ramen but don't want to go to the more well known places that are crowded. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"\"Watch out for the step!\" Those are the first words I heard upon entering the restaurant. I'm super thankful for them. I actually didn't see the step. I'm a klutz. I would have most certainly fallen.

I came with a few friends last week. We started off with the spicy chicken karaage. It wasn't very spicy. The spice came from the spicy mayo, and my piece didn't have much on it. These are large chunks of chicken. I prefer mine a little less two-bite, just in case I get stuff stuck in my teeth from biting into it. Tasty stuff though. Juicy.

Three of us got the tonkotsu and one got the devil spice miso ramen (not on the menu yet, but stay tuned. It'll be there soon). The tonkotsu was just a tad salty for me, but not as salty as a number of other ramen places. The broth was very tasty though, especially because they add their homemade shrimp oil. The shrimp oil isn't just oil. It's got little shrimps in it, and those little shrimps get added to your ramen for a tiny bit of extra crunch. I tried a spoonful of my friend's devil spice broth. One sip was enough to tell me it burned, but it was also delicious. Kudos to them for not creating a spicy soup just for the sake of spice. I poured the rest of that spoonful into my tonkotsu ramen and it gave my ENTIRE bowl a nice bit of heat. I wouldn't want to down a whole bowl of it, but for the spicy lovers out there, this is the ramen for you.

We got lychee sake. This wasn't a lychee flavored sake. It was a lychee in a sake cup. You pour the sake into the cup. The longer the sake sits in the cup with the lychee, the more lychee flavor is imparted into the sake. That sake was delightfully sweet when I had it at the end of the night, and the lychee was delightfully boozy after soaking in the sake. I think I like boozy fruits in general.

We finished with ice cream: taro, black sesame, and matcha. I appreciate the corn flakes topping the ice cream. For those of you who don't know, cereal and ice cream go really well together. My favorite line of the night: \"The taro tastes like taro.\" That sounds like an obvious statement, but given how many taro flavored desserts don't taste like taro, that this one does taste like taro ought to be celebrated. The black sesame and matcha were tasty as well, but the taro stands out.

Service was very friendly here as well. If I'm in the area and craving ramen, I know where to go!"}
{"text":"The flavour of the noodles is excellent with AAA service. Especially the vegetarian noodles is an extra bonus for this visit. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Location is really good, just across the street after you exit finch subway. 
takoyaki was not order made. It was the frozen food. Takoyaki used to be really hot inside but it was just a bit warm when I took a bite. 

I will go back again when I feel lazy to travel far but not my first choice in this area."}
{"text":"My favourite type of men- definitely ramen. 
This place is new and has very compact seating, but it's cozy and comfortable. The girls are really efficient and nice.

Lots of options on the menu for different things - dons, ramen, appetizers. Yo, if you work in the area, you've got to come here. A pint of asahi is $3.9 for lunch special. #howtogetlitatwork
There is a vegetarian ramen that comes with no soup.. what's a ramen without soup?? NOTHING. that's what. I got the spicy miso, which was creamy and has a great, unique spice. I didn't eat the cha shu, but it did look soft and well cooked as I lifted it out of my bowl. Takoyaki was also well done, crispy but well cooked on the inside. 

Prices weren't too bad. Pretty average for ramen in north York. They also have a speciality bowl- mountain ramen, which I swear can feed a small family. It's $19. Rough. On your wallet and your stomach. If you're DTE (down to eat) - goooooo for it."}
{"text":"The food and prices are good but I would appreciate more than one veg main on the menu. The existing veg soba needs more vegetables in the dish!"}
{"text":"Possibly another strong contender in ramen battle in North York! I loved the light layer of grease float around the mild-medium thickness soup, which is very rare to find in ramen brands in gta these days thanks to msg mixologists. I tried shio (salt) ramen which consists of mild tastes overall. Ah yes, I'd only wish if the chashu was a bit bigger! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good. An authentic Japanese Ramen store, chef is origin from Japan. Must try the vegetarian soba noodle, you will be amazed, best Raman for Summer."}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
Staff gave a friendly greeting as we walked in.  The place looked clean and cozy.

Food
====
I ordered Mount Fuji, as it seems to be their signature dish.  My fiancé ordered their Spicy Miso.

Fuji: 
- Too much sprouts and other odd pairings of veges.  I literally could not access the noodles without first eating through a layer of sprouts and cabbage.
- Meat was nicely charred and well seasoned.
- I liked the fried chicken.
- Noodles were ok.
- Soup was not as rich as I was imagining, I think the massive amounts of sprouts and cabbage watered down the flavour of the soup a bit.
- There was broccoli and fermented bamboo shoots thrown in the mix as well--for me this was an odd pairings. All these veges change the flavour of the soup, and so I'm not sure if I can fairly review the soup as it might have been great, but with the addition of all these vegetables the flavour was just kind of everywhere.
- The egg was ok. 

Spicy Miso:
- Soup tasted better
- The Spicy oil was strong, and had a really strong \"charred\" taste.
- Noodles were ok.
- Egg was ok.

Would I come back?
===============
It doesn't really hit the spot for me, like it doesn't satisfy my ramen craving but it if I just want some noodle soup and I was in the area I would drop in for a bowl."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem!  And I mean it, this is a gem!!!  Staff were super friendly, service was moderate (depending on what you ordered). First impression when we walked inside, very clean table tops, we were greeted immediately, chairs can be used as storage for your purses or belongings (don't forget to retrieve ur belongings when you leave!) Ok so what do I recommend: The Maze Soba!! Rich sauce,not too sticky, pork belly was just the right portion, would be nice if there was extra soup broth on the side just in case the noodle soaks up all the sauce.  Absolutely will come again to try their mount fuji ramen ($19.99) next time when I am SUPER hungry! It actually looks like a whole mountain piled up with all meats & ramen!!"}
{"text":"There are no good ramen places near me so imagine my reaction when I walked out of doctors appointment and found myself in front of this gem, as my tummy rumbled for food.

The ramen was divine. Exactly how I like it. Gooey egg, chewy noodles, perfectly seared yet soft pork, and salty bamboo.

The service was super fast and friendly, and needless to say it was a great experience. I already want to go back. Yum!"}
{"text":"I decided to go because I saw a few posts on instagram. When I arrived I realized the reason for the publicity was because they offer a 10% discount if you post a picture and checkin there on Social media. The highlight of this \"authentic Tokyo ramen\" are the noodles, it has a chewy texture, which I like. The noodles are thicker than other ramen places. As for the cha shiu, it should have a smokey, charcoal taste to it; but to me it just tastes burnt. The soup was also a let down - the broth is full of msg. It should be rich in flavour of pork bone broth that's been simmering for hours."}
{"text":"They are currently doing a soft opening on there store. 
Also they have a 15%discount if you post the food item on any social media. 

The serving seems a bit small for the price, (I'm basing this to the amount of ramen places I've been)
I had the spicy miso ramen. It wasn't  spicy as I expected but it has a slight kick to it. I wish they had some added spices to we can adjust the level of spice to our liking. 

The server is helpful with refill of drinks as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fuji bowl, and what a disappointment. It comes with 2 pieces of fried chicken, 4 slices of chashu (thin slices), 2 broccoli florets, and a mountain of bean sprouts. There were BARELY any noodle at all. The volume is an illusion, guys. I guess this is a good low carb diet menu for your next cheat meal.

The soup was also very bland, no flavor at all. Will not return for the ramen, I give it a 0/5 star.

The fried chicken was pretty good. Crispy and juicy, and just the right amount of saltiness. 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"There are so many ramen restaurants in this area and I am always willing to try new ones. I wanted to see how Menya Fuji compares to other ramen shops in Toronto. 

The restaurant is small and there aren't many seatings available. I came here when it wasn't peak hours so I can't say how busy and full this place gets. Me and my friends were greeted and seated quickly. 

Food: I ordered the shio ramen. My first impression was that there were few pieces of thin meat. I am aware that ramen don't usually come with a lot of meat. But the portion here was very small. The broth was nice. The broth was flavorful and it was very heavy. Other than the broth, the overall ramen did not impress me. The noodles were very average. There wasn't anything unique. Plus, there weren't a variety of toppings. It was mostly noodles and broth. 

I can't say I love this place and I probably won't make an effort to come back. They have a nice broth but it wasn't enough to convince to return."}
{"text":"I think after trying a good handful of ramen places around the yonge/finch area, this is probably my favorite!

There's something about the tonkotsu ship ramen that makes you want to drink the entire bowl. I believe it's the shrimp oil, which compliments to the saltiness of the ramen. This isn't something that I see at other ramen places, which is why I think this ramen at Menya Fuji is truly unique. I'm also a huge fan of bamboo shoots!

I also got to try the no-soup ramen, which has a more fried noodle kind of taste to it. There is some soup in the bowl, but it's very minimal. 

There's a promotion going on right now that if you post on your social media with the hashtag #MenyaFuji, you get 10% off your entire bill. 

Overall service was really great and fast. I'm definitely going to come back again for more!"}
{"text":"It's a new Japanese Ramen place that opened up about a week ago so decided to check it out with my friends. We ordered our respective Ramen noodles and some Chicken Karaage and Takoyaki balls to share. The Chicken Karaage was okay. The Karaage balls looked like it came from the supermarket. My bowl of noodle was yummy and texture of the noodles was good however portion was kinda small. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"There is some staff parking on the side of the building otherwise have to park far.  We ordered Karaage as appetizer.  It was very tasty and fried perfectly.
We ordered the Tonkatsu shio.  The noodles are just like the ones in San Francisco.  It's chewy and not starchy like the other places close by. The soup is perfect and very tasty.  I really like the soup base here.  The egg is very good with the centre running like its supposed to."}
{"text":"Have been driving pass this new ramen place but never had a chance to try it.  Decided to go with my girl as our favourite China noodle hangout was closed.  Ordered the Tonkotsu Tokyo ramen and it was a small portion. I tried the noodles and the noodles are not the pasta type nor freshly made, it seems like the noodles were frozen kind of noodles.  The Cha siu had pork smell in it.  The store did not turn on the AC on a 34 degree September night which made us both sweat like crazy."}
{"text":"New ramen joint in the Yonge and Finch area.  Saw some decent reviews and photos of this place so decided to check it out. Went on a Saturday afternoon with my food in crime partner and ordered the Original Karaage, Spicy Miso Ramen and the Mazesoba.  

Original Karaage $4.90 for four decent sized pieces of dark meat chicken.  Juicy, flavourful, can't really mess up deep fried dark chicken meat.

Spicy Miso Ramen $12.95. Thick soup broth, flavourful with a hint of smokiness.  Their spicy version is nothing special, it's basically Miso base soup with a tablespoon of the chilli oils you find at fast food joints.  It comes with these standard toppings free of charge, half boiled egg, bamboo shoots, corn and bean sprouts (which I opted out) and two pieces of chashu. Nothing special about the chashu, tastes like how chashu is supposed to taste like.  The noodles are a little thicker than the traditional ramen places I've been.  Has good chew and it doesn't feel like it will get soggy if you don't eat the noodles within 10 minutes.  My problem with this bowl of ramen? It's kid size portion.  Four slurps of the noodles and you're done.  Before you can actually savour this dish it's already gone.  

Mazesoba $11.95.  It's a dry version of pork ramen, think Chinese Lo Mein.  The pork pieces are not sliced but cut into bite sized pieces and comes standard with toppings listed above.  The noodles for this ramen is different, it's a little thicker with the same chewy texture.  Reminds me of thick wavy egg wonton noodles.  There's a smoky soy base like sauce with oil (maybe pork fat?) drizzled ontop of the noodles.

I give this Ramen joint two stars based on the following.  This place is mediocre compared to the other ramen restaurants just in that area.  There's nothing spectacular about their ramen.  Also for the price they charge for the portion they serve it's really not worth it.  You won't be full if you're expecting a meal out of one bowl... even after drinking the soup.  Not a place I would go again as there are better tasting ramen options in that area.  Also if you're looking for traditional Japanese Ramen this is not the place to go.  The owner is Chinese and you can taste the Chinese influenced flavours in the ramen.  From the chilli oil, the soup base which is heavy in seasoning instead of pork broth and thicker Asian style noodles."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food.
Must try their cold noodle and the ice cream!
Asahi on tap is great too!"}
{"text":"FOOD 4/5
SERVICE 5/5
OVERALL 4.5/5

We dropped by for some ramen on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was maybe 3/4 full, so we were able to get seats immediately. I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu, and my boyfriend ordered the Fuji Mountain. 

The fuji mountain is their special, and it comes with some great fried chicken. They mixed up my order and ended up giving me the Shiyu. I was debating between the Shoyu and Shiyu anyways, so I accepted the bowl. It was still a great ramen meal, and I especially liked the touch of shrimp oil. They ended up giving us 10% off for their error and a coupon to use in the future, which I didn't expect. Will have to come back to use that discount!

P.S. There are a few parking spots next to the restaurant, but they were occupied when we arrived. Ended up parking on a side street down the road."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen. Prices are fair, the ramens come with generous variety of add-ons (egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts etc.). Very fast service. Broth is flavourful, a bit on the cold side, I wish it was hotter. My favourite so far is the spicy miso. But it's definitely a tad spicier than what the average can handle. Tender noodles, pork tastes good, nothing too special. Overall awesome value!"}
{"text":"New ramen joint in Yonge & Finch neighbourhood. Owner is Japanese, they makes ramen in house.

We ordered two ramen, one is soup based, and the other is non-soup.

Tonkastu Shio Ramen: soup is less greasy and dense than those form Sansotei/Kinton. Because it's less dense, it's also less flavourful. I don't mind it actually, and I actually prefer this kind of soup. Portion is small. They use regular thin noodle for this. Unlike other ramen places, you cannot substitute to thick noodle. I asked them why, they said the owner think thick noodle gets soggy in the soup, defeat the purpose of chewy ramen. 

Mazesoba Ramen: LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH! The noodle is thick, super chewy! Best ramen I ever had in Toronto! And comparable to the ones I had in Japan!!!!! There are some pork in it, not a lot. Back to the noodle, this is probably the only ramen place that offered soup-less ramen. Honestly I have no idea what they put in the sauce, it is heavenly... YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT!

We also got two side dishes, fried chicken and octopus ball. They are just mediocre, nothing special."}
{"text":"Mediocre ramen. Place was small and not that busy. Takoyaki was just OK as well. It didn't taste fresh. Similar quality that you would get from a buffet. Previous reviews were right that portion was small. Good thing I got an appetiser. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I went to eat at this restaurant with my family. The service was great. But the food was ok. We ordered 4 dishes. Two rice and 2 noodle soup bowls.
I can't remember what the dishes were called though.  The best dish we had was the noodle dish with the chasu and noodle in soup. This was spicy."}
{"text":"I ordered the eel rice it's so delicious that I want to try later soon. The environment is pretty good. The staff will come to add water several times( like every 10 minutes), and they are kind. I will try ramen next time!"}
{"text":"Typically not a fan of ramen, but quite enjoyed this place. When entering the servers greet you and immediately seat you. Great service throughout the meal. We ordered the spicy miso ramen (pretty damn spicy), tonkotsu shio with shrimp oil ramen, spicy chicken karaage and takoyaki. The apps were both really good. I especially liked the takoyaki. I enjoyed the spicy miso ramen broth even though it was a lot spicier than I normally eat. I feel like the broth is more complex than the ones at Kinton, Kenzo, and Sansotei. One tip is that the tea is not free which was a little odd to me. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Always passed by this place but never got to try it for a long time until now! 

Must say a very convenient location indeed if your getting off at Finch station you can just walk across the street and your there. Only downfall is that there is very limited parking as this place is located right at the corner of Yonge and Finch... The place is pretty small from just the looks from inside it can only accommodate around 20-25 people.  Came around noon on a Saturday and wasn't too busy. 

Ordered the spicy tonkatsu pork ramen and a side order of karage. The karage was very large in size. Good value for the price. The ramen was also pretty decent as well. It was spicier than what I had thought but still tolerable. (had a sniffy/runny nose afterwards tho).  The only downside of ramen was the pork was very thin and small. Noodles were good and soup base had good taste and flavor. 

I would like to come back and try more of their other ramen bowls next time and see what they taste like. Ramen here is not bad but I recommend the karage as the pieces are large and quite good."}
{"text":"The good: the ramen was surprisingly quite good. Broth was on point. It's not the best of the best (I do believe sansotei and santouka are a touch better), but it does well for the next best thing after those. I ordered the menya Fuji mountain ramen special. It will definitely fill you up! But it's probably something I will not order again (will prefer the regular sized ramen at a much lower cost). The spicy ramen was good too, but...

The bad: it was odd that the spicy ramen alone cost $4 more just to add some chilli peppers. Soooo up to your discretion if you want that. It was good though.

The ugly: nothing too ugly about this place

Blurb: definitely would come back, great for smallish groups, can accommodate big groups but limited seating. Still in soft opening for 15% off :). Will come back to try the rest of the best!"}
{"text":"We've been excited for this new ramen store to be opened right in our neighbourhood. It's very clean and spacious inside and the location is just perfect. 

We ordered the spicy miso and the shoyu ramen. Both of them came with egg and pork chasiu and I have to say that the ones here are nice and thick. The pieces that had mixtures of fat and lean meat tasted great and chewy but the pieces with lean meat tends to be alot more tough. The ramen selection is just the thick ones, which I prefer but they don't have the same curves as Sensotei which I much enjoy. 

The spicy miso soup was decent - slightly average and it had a medium flavour - not super spicy but I felt that the dish had too much bean sprouts instead of the ramen ratio. My partners shoyu came piping hot which was great (mines was just slightly warm) and the soup was lighter. Definitely better in my opinion. 

After eating the bowls of ramen we both felt rather thirsty.. I think the two of us drank 3 cups of water each but we had our waters refilled nicely every time. The service was attentive. 

Overall, It is a very competitive location to open a ramen shop especially with strong leaders such as Sensotei just around a block down. I do hope this store the best. Will come back next time to update this review - I probably won't be as generous then. I hope menya continues to improve their ramen quality then, I hear they have great success on the other part of our country!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to the neighbourhood! I went in the afternoon, it was a nice snack to be honest... I was hungry a bit later on. The ramen broth was delicious - I got the Spicy Miso. There was a nice texture to the noodles, however the cha shu was sliced quite thin, one of the ones I got was even a bit dry/overcooked (see photo). Really small portion compared to other ramen spots nearby. They just opened so I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"If you want to try a different shio tonkatsu ramen, you can come try this place! They add shrimp oil to their shio ramen which makes it more flavourful (you can actually see tiny dried shrimps in the oil). This was what my friend ordered and I tried a bit of it and quite like it. I ordered the spicy ramen and asked for less spicy, it tasted pretty good too! My friend and I both really like the texture of the ramen noodles because it was the right thickness and chewiness. The cha siu in the ramen was average though, so I took off one star for that. Overall not bad if you are looking to grab some quick quality ramen!"}
{"text":"Menya Fuji is your typical ramen place but the service here was excellent, quick, and attentive. I decided to try the Black Tonkatsu ramen and the broth was nice and flavourful. The black garlic is created from the long fermentation process of white garlic and apparently has double the antioxidants than that of white garlic! (Not sure if it is a significant amount but yay) The noodles had a tad bit of the instant noodle texture to it but nonetheless the toppings combined with the broth definitely made for a great meal on a cold windy day. They have long wooden tables with bench seats and a cube underneath your seat where you can store your coat or other items. It is also a dark place with low lighting but comforting for the eyes. Definitely this is another great ramen place located conveniently close to Yonge and Finch. Thumbs up Menya!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and got the tonkotsu ramen and chicken karaage to start. Chicken was moist and crispy, although could have used a bit more seasoning. Ramen was very good, broth was rich and well seasoned and noodles had a nice texture. If you're really hungry I would suggest the mount Fuji ramen as I found the regular ramen was satisfying but could've used a bit more noodles."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen broths that I have tasted.  It is rich, creamy, not too salty and has a nice strong but balanced mushroom earthy taste.  The ramen noodles also have a pleasant chewy texture.  I've been here twice and both times the service was excellent.  Compared to most ramen restaurants, this one is much quieter and allows for conversations.  It is ideal for small groups and it is not overly packed.

I feel like this restaurant is underrated, and likely because of it's secluded location (off of Yonge and Finch), and it's subdued decor that doesn't allow it to stand out from other restaurants in the area.  I'm convinced that if Menya spent more money on their decor, there would be people lining up out the door for their ramen."}
{"text":"My new favourite ramen place! Better than sansotei, kinton etc. 

We ordered the Tonkotsu Shio, Spicy Miso and Karage. 

They add shrimp oil to their tonkotsu shio ramen which gives it a huge flavour boost. The chasu slices were a perfect balance between fat and meat. Their noodles are by far the best I've ever had. 

The karage was 4 larger than normal pieces of thigh. Definitely recommend. 

Overall it was amazing no complaints. This place is still pretty new so it wasn't a long wait for a table and you get 10% off for posting on insta or fb."}
{"text":"The Black Tonkatsu Ramen is pretty good here. The garlic oil is not as overpowering as it is as SansoTei and the broth was very satisfying. I can see how the portions can be considered too small for some but it was perfect for me. The only complaint I have is the chasiu which was not tender enough. I'm used to SansoTei where the meat breaks apart. This one was a bit chewy. Overall I think SansoTei is still my favourite ramen place in North York."}
{"text":"Came to this place when it just opened up.  This is a chinese owned restaurant serving japanese food.   Bad idea!   I ordered the japanese ramen.   Not sure what I got.  portion were so tiny.  the noodles were chinese noodles.  the pork chashu was horrible.   the broth was attrocious.   not sure what they were trying to pull here, but if they are trying to serve japanese ramen, they failed miserably.   Try to rebrand your restaurant to serve chinese noodles.  You might do better."}
{"text":"The food was delicious at the soft opening.  Had the karage and miso ramen. Soup was a little salty but the flavour was very good."}
{"text":"Great little place !

The noodles was great and the portions were well sized. 

Recommend this for small groups."}
{"text":"good service. the service is really good. Ramen is tasty. The amount is that lot. However, it fits me. Generally, 4 stars"}
{"text":"Got the Fuji ramen for 20$. Not worth it. The whole bowl was basically beansprouts propping up the: two pieces of fried chicken,  flavour less chasiu, two pieces of broccoli, and some sprinkles of corn. The takoyaki was ok. Spicy ramen was not so spicy. Seating is decent, not good for big groups"}
{"text":"10% off if you post on FB or Instagram.  Doesn't say when this promo ends.

Mini rant here.  Not a fan of ramen in general.  I can over salt my own broth in noodles then add canned corn and half an egg.  Not sure why people pay for this.

Anyways, I ordered fried chicken on rice.  Taste was good, not too much mayo and reasonably priced.  I would go back for this.  Great location with it being so close to Goodlife."}
{"text":"Finally checked out this newly open ramen shop at the SE corner of Yonge and Finch :) Menya Fuji not only serves Tokyo styled ramen noodles but also delicious rice bowls, snacks and desserts.

You have probably seen photos for the huge bowl of Fuji Mountain Ramen ($19.85); it is definitely insta-worthy and can feed me for days lol.

I would highly recommend the Cold Veg Soba Ramen ($11.95). It is served with thick chewy noodles (my fave!) and with a nice peanut sauce (no soup). You can have it spicy or non-spicy.

The karaage fried chicken ($4.90) is also served hot x fresh, and very juicy! #mustorder! The seaweed salad ($5.90), on the other hand, is a tad expensive for its size but nevertheless, still tasty.

The taro ice cream ($2.90) is a nice way to end your meal here! It comes with cornflakes on top, which is a nice touch :)

Lastly, the 150ml house lychee sake ($5.90) definitely stole my heart. It is served cold and each sake cup you get has a lychee fruit in it too ^^

{"text":"If you always feel like there's not enough food in your ramen, get the Fuji ramen. It's got everything. But it's $20 per bowl. Not bad. Worth a try. :) 
Good service as well."}
{"text":"5 stars for the ramen!! 

Spicy Miso Ramen: Any non-spicy noodles taste bland to me and I always add extra chili peppers or other spicy sauces to eat soup based noodles. This bowl of ramen, however, is the perfect amount of spiciness so I drank almost all of the broth. The portion is pretty small though! It comes with half an egg and 2 slices of pork. I added an egg to it and still not full after the noodles and drinking the broth. I'm 5\"2 and don't eat a lot so guys might want to order extra noodles or chashu. 

Unagi Don(BBQ eel rice) : The sauce was WAYYYYYYYY too sweet and they put WAYYYYYYY too much sauce so I couldn't even have one peaceful bite of plain rice. The It's all good though, took it to go and probably will make some extra rice to soak up all those extra sauce."}
{"text":"Great ramen place and a very welcome addition to the Yonge/Finch area. Small resto right at Finch TTC station area. I was hesitant at first given that it doesnt look all that impressive on the outside, but inside the resto it is charming and has the typical Japanese resto look.

Our groups ordered one ramen each and shared some appetizers - karaage (fried chicken), and takoyaki (fried squid balls). 

I was especially impressed with the karaage. There are just too many bad versions of it elsewhere, and the one here taste really authentic and has a nice crispiness on the outside where still able to maintain a moist and tender inside. Delish!

For myself, I ordered the  Fuji Mountain ramen. It is absolutely huge and if you dine alone I would not suggest getting any appetizers at all if this is what you'll be ordering. It is a meat-lovers ramen, with two slices each of 2 different cuts of pork (belly and shoulder), karaage, and an whole egg + sprouts. It is absolutely delicious. The miso broth is really nice and flavourful too, and not oily. I highly recommend getting this.

As far as my favourite ramen places goes in Toronto, Menya Fuji rockets up to my top 3 list, and definitely the top place in the North York area."}
{"text":"Saw this place a lot on Instagram and decided to go for a friend's birthday. 

Price Range ( Not including Tax and Tip): $3-$7 for appetizers and about $11-$15 for ramen which is on par with other ramen places. 

Food Quality (Taste, Serving Size, Menu) - 4/5
I had the Spicy Miso Ramen with extra Pork and my group split the Karaage and Spicy Karaage. I thought I could handle the how Spicy the ramen but I was insanely wrong. The flavour was really good and I liked how the pork taste, but I should probably a less spicier version next time or train myself to handle it haha. The karaage was really good as well, decent size and crispy. I preferred the spicy karaage over the regular but enjoyed both. The menu size was what you expect for a ramen place. The portions were good and I like the meat to noodle ratio as well. 

Atmosphere - 3/5
It's a small place and doesn't offer a lot of seats, so I recommend calling in before if you have a large group. It's near Yonge and Finch so I'd recommend parking at Finch Station on weekends since it's free and a short walk. For a ramen place it has a modern looking going which I liked, made it standout compared to other ramen places. 

Service - 3/5
The staff was nice and did a good job at recommending dishes. They didn't come around to fill up water as much as I would have liked, could have used it for how spicy it was haha.  They were more hands off, came when we asked, consistent with other ramen places. The food came at a reasonable time and everyone in our group got our food around the same time. 

Would I go again?
Yes! I liked the flavour a lot, I want to see how much better it would taste with my mouth not being on fire. 

Lash's Recommendations 
Spicy Miso Ramen - If you can handle REALLY spicy stuff more than I can, this dish will make you happy. 

Kaarage - Great appetizer, will def have you leaving this place happy."}
{"text":"Menya Fuji is tucked away at Finch and Yonge. Plenty of ramen joints en route but trust me, you want to save your appetite for Menya. Came in past 3PM for 2. I am a serial karaage eater so to share we ordered spicy karaage, tonkotsu shoyu ramen, and the tonkotsu shio ramen.

Before I get into food let's talk about the service. Perhaps it was because we were the only guests (missed the lunch time rush) but we were treated like king and queen. Our server was happy, checked on us often, and was timely to fill our drinks. She gets a 5/5.

Let's talk food. The deep fried chicken comes in a set of 4 well-sized pieces. The chicken is tender and juicy. But it was not spicy at all, it was the normal order of karaage with spicy mayo drizzled on top. If you have had spicy karaage at Kinton you'd have higher expectations.

The ramen bowls were bueno. The noodles were cooked to perfection - had the integrity of a tough but palatable noodle. The soups were tasteful, not overly salted, and drinkable to the bottom of the bowl. The chashu had good torched flavor but was too fatty. The meal as a whole gets a 3.5.

Absolutely recommend Menya Fuji to all you ramen lovers. Don't sleep on the 10% off by checking in on Facebook or Instagram with a photo of your meal."}
{"text":"2.5 is my rating
For some reason I wasn't really feeling it with my meal  and the food just wasn't tasty.

Fuji Mountain Ramen ($19.95)
Large pieces of cha shu, karaage aka Japanese fried chicken, loaded with a bunch of veggies including broccoli, cabbage and bean sprouts, all topped on a bowl of ramen. The cha shu was mediocre imo, it was cooked by torched so didn't have much flavor and each piece had a lot of fat. The karaage was good, large pieces but got soggy since it was in the soup. Lots of veggies so that was nice. The egg sucked though, was not soft boiled and the yolk was cooked. The soup was slightly bland imo, the regular shoyu ramen was saltier and had stronger taste. Large bowl of noodles with a lot of ingredients, but kind of expected given it was $20.

P.S. they charge for tea, $2"}
{"text":"Used to come here as a go to ramen place with my girlfriend and we both loved it and now our hearts are broken because it has been replaced by a Chinese chain restaurant :((("}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to learn of the opening of this place, especially after hearing/reading all the fine reviews. After trying it out recently, I am really not sure what the hype is all about.

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE:

The service was strong and efficient given the busy rush they had while we were there. Decent atmosphere as well - they make good use of fairly limited space, and had some stylish decor. I imagine the patio will be enjoyable once we make it through this winter as well.

FOOD:

However, the food itself was a bit of a disappointment. The \"Spicy Karaage Chicken\" was nothing to write home about (although apparently enough to write to Yelp about). Perhaps it was the aforementioned busy rush, but the dish was on the cold side, and the batter not particularly crispy. Affordably priced however, compared to some other similar places.

I also went with the \"Fuji Mountain Ramen,\" which appears to be the restaurant's flagship item. They clearly do a fine job with its presentation, but that appears to be its best feature. At almost $20 a pop, it was quite disappointing to learn that the \"mountain\" of ramen was mostly (almost entirely) bean sprouts and cabbage. Aside from a couple of large pieces of brocolli, which did not seem to add anything beyond aesthetic value (they're trees next to the mountain!), there was not nearly enough pork or noodles to justify that price point. The broth was quite tasteless as well. I searched for chili oil to add, but was unable to find any :(

Perhaps I'm being too harsh given the high expectations I had going in. I'll probably try it out one more time, and see how other dishes fare."}
{"text":"As people who have had famous ramen in Japan and all around the GTA before, we highly recommend this place for authentic pork ramen. Better than Kinton, on par with Isshin at Bathurst & College.

We saw this new ramen spot at Yonge and Finch on Blogto and decided to drop by to give it a try. The shio and miso ramens that we had were tasty and of a good size. The quality was fairly better than the Kinton just down the street. The staff are friendly and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Like most reviewer said, not as good as Santosei! Overall doesn't taste bad, a few things could be better 
1. My ramen was really oily; like a thin layer of oil on top
2. The egg yoke wasn't as runny as it should be 
3. Very hot inside the restaurant 

My wife's miso ramen wasn't bad tho"}
{"text":"The staff is very nice and attentive.
And their kara-age (Japanese fried chicken) was nice and juicy.

However, their ramen was not the best.
I tend to be more picky when it comes to ramen (I've been eating ramen in Japan since I was 5) and it didn't really cut it for me.
But they were really nice!"}
{"text":"Soft Opening was a amazing experience for me. The staff and the ambience was really pleasant. A nice step up for Koreatown"}
{"text":"I love the ramen here and the spicy karaage was top notch. I got the shio ramen which was awesome. I thought the portion size was fair. I do prefer sansotei's creamier broth but this was good too. The karaage is definitely the best though. There was no wait this weekend lunch which was a nice change from other ramen spots with long waits. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"While the meal wasn't bad, it didn't stand out either as I had expected. The service was a bit hit and miss too with them trying to take our bowls away 2 or 3 times when we still had noodles in them. Then when we asked for our bill, they forgot and we had to ask again. Nothing significant, but considering the many options in the area it certainly wouldn't be my first choice to eat. No wait on a Saturday at 7 pm though."}
{"text":"This place is not authentic at all. We ordered the Fuji mountain ramen that is $19.99, was expected the portion would be double the amount, but the whole bowl of ramen are just filled up with bean sprouts, I've never seen a bowl of authentic ramen with bean sprouts and broccolis. The cha sius were not good as well. The cups that they provided us were not clean as well, there were some oils at the bottom, so we had to ask them to exchange it. Overall, I won't come back again, not worth for the money."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of my friends because I heard good things about their ramen but overall, my experience was pretty average. While the prices are on par with other ramen spots, their portion is much smaller than expected. I'm not a huge eater and I didn't get full after my meal.

The spicy miso ramen I got was quite tasty - it was true to the spice level as indicated so if you can't handle spicy food, I would suggest adjusting it to mild. However, my friend got the Fuji mountain ramen and he requested for no bean sprouts. For $19.99, you would think you would be getting double the portion but instead the \"mountain\" is just a mountain of bean sprouts so when he got his order, it looked like a normal bowl of ramen. Wouldn't really recommend anyone to order that even though it's their specialty, it's a complete rip-off.

With so many better ramen options in the area, I'm not sure I would visit again."}
{"text":"Holy shit it cured my fever and cold in one sitting I'm not even kidding. Broth isn't starchy, noodles are springy. I had a class A goddamn experience eating their black garlic ramen. However, it came out at room temperature? How does that even happen? All in all, WOULD GO AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Ok new favourite ramen spot!

I usually don't like to eat ramen too much as I find the broth too salty (am I the only one like this?) but decided to check this place out after seeing the good reviews on Yelp. 

TIP: please be careful entering this restaurant as there's a step down and I did not know and almost slipped and wiped out (would've been 5/5 yelp stars on embarrassment)

I had the shio ramen and the waitress kindly suggested to try the chicken karaage or takoyaki as appetizers. My friend and I decided to go with the chicken karaage and it proved to be an excellent choice. The ramen was just the right portion too and I loved the light broth - I felt so much healthier haha.

Curious to know how their takoyaki is so I guess I'll have to update this review soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night and between the six of us, I think we covered most of the ramen on the menu and I think the consensus is that the ramen here tended to be on the creamier side.

I ended up getting the new Black Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.50 + $1 for sweet corn) and found it just ok. For me, ramen is first about the noodles which I found to be on the softer side - I prefer my noodles to have a bouncier springy texture. The black tonkotsu broth was infused with black garlic which is created by fermenting regular garlic under stringent heat and humidity settings. This added a sweetness to the broth but I was hoping for a little more depth in flavour (like the smokey tonkotsu at Konjiki). What I did like about the broth was that it was quite creamy and heavy which helped to keep me full as the portions are a little bit smaller. I was also hoping for more toppings in the ramen which really only had some enoki mushrooms, green onions and half a soft-boiled egg.

Space wise, it's small and cozy and will probably accommodate around 40 people and there is very limited parking next to the store. In true Japanese style, they have wooden tables and chairs which have storage underneath it so that you can enjoy your meal without crowding yourself with your bags or jackets. Service was fine but I was sure that they didn't bring tea to the table - I found out afterwards that apparently they charge for tea."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen in the neighbourhood! The noodles are chewy and are never over cooked. The Spicy Miso Tonkotsu is my go to, but the Tonkotsu Shoyu is good as well. Beware of their hot sauce, it is really spicy and you only need a little for a kick. Portions are a little small, but Karage Don (small) or Karage is a good side to share between two if you're still hungry. Lastly, the icecream comes with cornflakes at the bottom and adds a yummy crunch to the dessert. I would definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Tried their special ramen with everything in it and unfortunately there was too much stuff going on. The vegs diluted the broth. There was also too much bean sprouts in comparison to ramen noodles. 
I do recommend getting their chicken and rice, large portion, reasonably priced and delicious"}
{"text":"After passing by Menya several times, we finally decided to give it a try.

We went on a weekday around dinner time and was seated quickly. The shop is quite spacious, which is something you typically don't experience at a ramen store. Service was quick and attentive.  

Fuji Ramen (aka the Mountain Ramen): 
It was alright. The noodles were bouncy however the broth was too salty for our liking (after our dinner we found ourselves thirsty for water.) The cha siu was delicious and the soft boiled eggs were done well. The skin of the karage tasted powdery and the chicken looked slightly undercooked. The veggies complemented the meal well. 

Takoyaki:
Pretty good. It had a crispy exterior and was not too doughy like other places. One star would be taken off as the filling was still cold.

Overall impression: not bad if you're craving a quick meal, though there are other options in the area that may satisfy you better."}
{"text":"Tuesday after a long weekend I noticed a sign that said ???? (that's ramen in Japanese) on my trek to Magic Noodle with a group from work that I didn't notice before.  However, since we're already commited to Magic Noodle that day I decided that I will try that restaurant out some day that is...

Wednesday (the next day).  My food buddy/co-worker and I were looking at a sign in front listing the menu items and explaining that chashu wasn't a typo for cashew to my colleague. 

The thing that caught my eye was the Fuji Ramen which costs shy of $20, but looked really appetizing.  Unfortunately I had Booster Juice already in the morning so I wasn't too hungry, so I was explaining I will get the \"default ramen\" which is the Tonkotsu Shio Ramen.

BIG WARNING for new visitors.  There is a very steep and sudden step past the door that is hardly noticeable which is very much a tripping hazard.  Just be careful with it.

For $10.95 the Tonkotsu Shio Ramen was not bad for the area. It adds a bit of extra fragrant flavour compared to the regular Tonkotsu Ramen because of the shrimp oil.  I think that's better than the black garlic oil that other ramen places use. It had the regular fix ins such as the soft boiled egg and large pieces of chashu. The soup base was good too and as a nice bonus.

The umami levels are just right it's not too over powering which is good for lunch. If it was stronger I may not be able to work too well. 

No MSG feels even with their egg. Other places I tried in the area such as Kinton and Sansotei has MSG in their eggs at least I get the feels when I get their eggs. The soup was good I drank and ate to the last drop. 

Considering how this place is so close to work this is my official default for lunch now. And service was good and efficient. I didn't have to ask for water refills either. 

The next day, Thursday, I had steak and eggs for breakfast. So that means I couldn't risk eating the Fuji ramen. So I went for the next item on the menu which was the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. It tasted as expected. Like it came from Eldoon Noodles (from Ace Attorney 4). SOOOO SALTY!  Though I expected it. Unfortunately I couldn't handle the excessive sodium content so I wasn't able to finish the soup. Though I still ate all the other parts. I just won't order this $10.95 dish next time. 

Friday. I skipped breakfast short of a glucerna bar so I won't be too hungry before they open at 11:30 in preparation for the Fuji Ramen. 
I planned it well enough in advance so that I do my deployment tasks for work before lunch and set up the meeting invite with my food buddies so we can go there as soon as possible and block off their calendars. 

When it arrived it actually wasn't that big looking as the one on the sign.  I was kind of relieved at that because the picture in the sign looked like it may be too much for lunch. 

I started picking through the ingredients. Starting with the extra large pieces of chashu. The taste scales up with the size. Ooh so yummy. 

Then I started pecking at the karaage (fried chicken bits) ooh so juicy. I never had karaage with ramen before. This is awesome. 

Then the rest were pretty much standard fare only a lot more. Before I got to the noodles. 

It also took a while as well to get to be able to even use the spoon to drink the broth. 

Overall the combination was divine. 

The only problem I had with this but since I was too hungry I didn't care was the egg halves was slightly over cooked and not as runny. 

About just past the half way mark I was feeling challenged already. My colleagues already finished their Tonkotsu Shio Ramen. And the bowl was doing the Nelson Hah-Hah at me. 

I wasn't going to let it beat me. 

At 80% completion I was about to surrender so I just talked a bit with my colleagues about work to help me digest as this will not taste good as left over. 

Eventually I beat the bowl. Whew. 

But I didn't feel bloated at all just a little over satiated. Slightly worried wondering how I will work later in the afternoon.

However the food was relatively digested with the short walk back to work.  And I was able to do my work. Though I am in too much bliss to figure out what to write for the review until today."}
{"text":"I dropped by Menya Fuji a few weeks ago with a friend on a weekday night. Place was not busy at all and service was friendly and attentive as staff frequently refilled our waters. 

For food, I ordered the Tonkotsu shio ramen while my friend ordered the cold veg soba ramen. Honestly, the ramen was underwhelming in terms of flavour. The noodles had the right consistency and texture but whole dish itself was forgettable. Only great thing was that we were able to get 10% off if we posted our pictures on social media.

Overall, good service, average ramen."}
{"text":"What I ordered: 
*Shio ramen with pork slices (chashu)

I'm going to keep this review short. 

If you're looking for ramen that rivals the best in Japan (ex. Ichiran), then stop, you won't be happy with what you find here. 

If on the other hand you're looking for one of the better bowls of ramen in North York, then you will be pleasantly surprised."}
