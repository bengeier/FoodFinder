{"text":"Nous étions 5 et avons tous beaucoup aimé. Tout était excellent, très bonne cuisine indienne...Samosas, oignons baji, pain nan, poulet tika masala, agneau korma, légumes au cari etc. tout était vraiment bon. Bon service et en plus c'est un AVV. Nous y retournerons c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from this place - they messed up our order after it got here an hour and a half after we ordered. The owner said we live too far (it is a 15 minute drive from the restaurant). They offered to make it right by offering a credit on our next order. When we called back and asked for the credit, we were denied. The staff is extremely impolite and rude - especially the woman who answers the phone. The food is not worth the trouble. Go somewhere else where the management actually cares about its customers."}
{"text":"Propreté chancelante, service ordinaire, nos deux pizza un peu fade et ordinaire. Bref..."}
{"text":"De la qualité à prix honnête. Portions généreuses (combo végétarien) et livraison rapide!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés ma conjointe et moi à ce bon petit resto de quartier et nous avons été agréablement surpris de la qualité  et de la fraîcheur de la nourriture. Le poulet au beurre est excellent et les portions généreuses!  A découvrir!"}
{"text":"J'ai choisi le thali non végétarien. Le riz était froid.  L'agneau n'était pas assez cuit et toutes les sauces étaient trop sucrées.  Service rapide par contre."}
{"text":"We were tired and hanging out with our neighbours and decided to order in a pile of food to have a relaxed dinner together. Tandoori Mahal came up on the app I had on hand, we quickly ordered a pile of vegetarian things we were craving and they arrived in about 30 minutes. 

The dishes we ordered including a palak paneer, channa samosas, vegetable korma, aloo gobhi, and a rice and some naan. We were quite happy with everything! Not mind-blowing maybe but really nice subtle flavours, everything tasted quote fresh and well cooked. The rice was aromatic and perfectly textured. The flavours in the channa samosas were my favourite, and I loved the creamy korma. 

Overall a delivery success!!"}
{"text":"Walked by this bring your own restaurant.. and stood there for a few minutes. Ok I looked inside and thought ok it's an Indian restaurant and looks good. Then I looked up again and something didn't look right! Indian and Italian restaurant .. 
So Tandoori Mahal Indian resto AND Casanova  Italian resto.. 
Masala meet Lasagne
Seems like this use to be an Italian resto and it was brought by an Indian chef. So he desired to open an Indian resto and keep the Italian menu as well. 
I found the price a little high but I was impressed with the portions.
The tasting menu was well worth it. I can't say it's the best I've had. The naan was a little on the bread side then the lighter. The lamb was ok, found it a little hard and chewy. Flavours were good, I can't say they were amazing.. the  desert gulab jamun was really good.. 
The service was excellent and we have a comfortable two seat booth. 
I would go back... I'd like to see what the pizza is like ;)"}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe indienne à prix super raisonnable. Très calme comme endroit. J'ai de la misère à ne pas prendre le Tika Masala parce qu'il est vraiment bon!"}
