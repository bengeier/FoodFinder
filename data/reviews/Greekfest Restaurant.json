{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Greekfest on a recent visit to Phoenix. Authentic Greek food and prompt/courteous service made for a lovely evening. Our server even offered to take a photo of our group before we could ask him to do so.
The only drawback I could envision for this restaurant is it's tucked away from the road. We had trouble finding it, even with our GPS. I'm so happy we did though!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food at reasonable prices! Highly recommend greekfest salad and gyros meat with an order of pita! Delicious and you won't leave hungry!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a friend. I am a vegetarian so I had the eggplant dip & Greek salad. The eggplant dip was very good & had a different taste than the middle eastern/Lebanese type I am use to. The salad was good, but the tomatoes on it were not great which is typical in Arizona if you don't buy local/organic.

My friend had the lamb & she raved about it, said it was one of the best lamb dishes she had ever had. Our waiter was very nice & the owner even came out to check on us. I was avoiding wheat today so I did not try any of the breads & just had cucumbers with my eggplant dip. I am anxious to go back & try more things next time."}
{"text":"For some reason I'm gonna give them 4 stars even though the food was kinda cold. I would go back again to give them another shot. Service was good though."}
{"text":"So,  overall great food BUT VERY MISLEADING.

We sat down got offered bread- with dinner were offered a salad or soup- bill came... And found out that we were surprisingly charged for all of above. 

The server made it seem that everything (like a normal restaurant) was included...

We were very disappointed with that- so restaurant goers BEWARE."}
{"text":"This is a truly wonderful Greek restaurant - one that my wife and I return to over and over again.  No, it's not always all that busy - but that's not because the food, the ambiance, and the service aren't terrific; I suspect that most people simply haven't yet had an opportunity to try delicious Greek cuisine.  And no, it's not fast food - it's great food.  All of the dishes are made with care, and with flair, and Tony and Susan and their staff are as gracious as they are skilled.  My wife and I love this place.  The fish, the lamb, the chicken, the appetizers and desserts - everything is fresh, and everything is superbly made.  

Greekfest is truly the best!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Easily the best and most authentic Greek food in Phoenix. Their best dish is the arni(lamb shank) but you have to call ahead and request it. Every time I come I feel like I am back in the village in Greece!"}
{"text":"This is a must try when you are looking for your Greek fix. The sampler appetizer is great. I had one of the casseroles and it had huge chunks of Lamb that were tender and tasty. The server was extremely helpful and never let a water glass go empty. A very positive experience."}
{"text":"There is a difference between authentic and antiquated and unfortunately this is the latter. The food was ok but spending HOURS on a weeknight waiting for food in an empty restaurant in the most uncomfortable chair I've ever sat in was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Greek food, this is the place to come. Some of the dishes are a bit pricey but well worth it. The flavors were incredible and everything was fresh. Our waiterZeff was the best.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Here on business. I had the lamb and it was great. Their roasted eggplant is very good. Their rice pilaf is very good too, has some broth-iness to it. Very nice staff. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"There were so many positive and negative reviews I could not decide if we should go here for dinner or not.   My friend received positive feedback from a pal at the gym who guaranteed her this was the best Greek food in Phoenix.    Annnnnnnnnd, they were wrong.    We walked out after our vodka and tonic's came back tasting bad.  Who can mess up a vodka and tonic??

Pretty restaurant but the food and drinks were awful."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and tasty food. We loved it so much we're going back soon. Best greek restaurant in Phoenix. Ambiance was unique and authentic. Pita yum. Yogurt yum. Made for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I actually give this place 0 stars. food-wise, our meal was alright but service was pretty slow. after dinner we ordered tiramisu for dessert. after our server brought it out, we started to eat it, expecting it to be delicious, but no! the first thing we noticed was the disgusting bitter taste and then we took a closer look at the cake. right away we realized the cake was moldy! and I don't mean a little moldy - it was chock-FULL of green mold!!! of course we had already taken a bite because we were not expecting that, so we just started spitting it out like crazy, but could not manage to get the horrible taste out of our mouths. we told our server and he did not believe it at first so we insisted the cake was moldy. he took it away and brought us a fresh tiramisu, which we no longer had an appetite for. the owner came to talk to us when he casually apologized and did not offer to compensate by reducing any part of our bill. the only thing he did for us was give us some free biscotti, which we weren't the least bit interested in. on the bill we were charged for the full meal including the dessert. obviously NEVER going there again! and from now on when dining out we ALWAYS carefully inspect our food before taking the first bite!"}
{"text":"I made a wrong turn and decided to pull into parking lot to get headed in the right direction again. That's when I spotted the front doors to Greekfest. My husband loves Greek food, used to live there when he was a little boy. I thought. \"We should try this place out!\"

As soon as you walk in, all the details come into view. The color scheme, d√©cor, wood floors, Grecian art and accents. I love how clean and well kept it looks. We were promptly greeted by a friendly server and sat at a corner table. Then, our culinary adventure began!

We ordered the Dolmas, flamed lamb sausage, Spanikopita, grilled octopus, ouzo, and ended dinner with Pastitsio. Portions are enough for 2 people and served tapas style. It's so much fun to try a little of this and that. So... how was it? DELICIOUS! We were so surprised that we hadn't heard of this place before and are so happy that we now have our \"go-to\" Greek restaurant. 

What really sets this place apart, beside the delicious farm to table food (the chef picks his greens and herbs from a garden behind the building), is the charming staff and friendly owners. They came to our table and talked to us about our travels and the history of their restaurant. When the owner found out my husband and I were recently married, she came back a few moments later with a to-go container of Greek wedding cookies a lovely card wishing us the best in our new marriage. It's little things like that that make the dining experience so much fun. 

We will definitely be back!! Thank you for everything, Greekfest! :)"}
{"text":"This is the finest Greek food in town.  If you think of Greek food as cheap and casual, then you will probably be surprised.  This is a fancier, and pricier, version.  The food here is absolutely amazing.  It's fresh, authentic, expertly prepared, and delicious.  Everything we have had -- soups, savory pastries, seafood, lamb -- has been terrific.  I especially appreciate that you can find menu items here that are common in Greece, but rare in the many Americanized Greek restaurants that are scattered around town.  This extends to the list of Greek wines.  We go elsewhere for delicious casual Greek food (see my review of Cyprus Grill), but this restaurant tops our list for a date or a special occasion."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. This is my first yelp review-I am finally breaking in because this place deserves 5 stars and a fabulous review! 

We started off with the small dishes like the calamari and lamb sausage and then split an entree for two. The flavors were unbelievable. So many different tastes and textures. Could not have asked for a better dinner experience. The staff was so welcoming and helped us with wine pairings and decisions on the menu. We will definitely be back...and will bring friends!"}
{"text":"Maybe I caught this restaurant on a bad night, but my experience was terrible. Having no experience with Greek food, I expected my waiter to be knowledgeable and be able to speak English to recommend a dish. However, our server spoke broken English, was extremely touhcy feely and overly attentive. When we arrived there was not a soul to be found in this restaurant. When I asked what certain things were on the menu, I couldn't understand his responses and ended up randomly picking something. My meal was awful. I couldn't tell you what it was, but all I know is I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! The staff recommendations were spot on. The tomato, cucumber and onion salad was the best I have had. The owner even came out and had a good conversation. The atmosphere is both country and relaxing. My wife and I really enjoyed ourselves and it will certainly become a regular in our date night rotation."}
{"text":"My entire family is Greek and I lived in Greece for 10 years. My parents owned a restaurant growing up so I know good food. This place has AWESOME food!!! It's the type of food you'd get at a fancier restaurant in Greece. Typically, those restaurants add a gourmet spin to traditional dishes, and that is exactly what they do at Greekfest! The food is high quality, you can taste that it's fresh. Best dolmades in town, NOT from a can. They taste like my grandmother's. The owner, Susan, greets every table, while her husband cooks everything. The octopus is perfect, and so is the calamari, and Aegean Eggplant. Authentic Greek music plays in the background always, and the servers are great. From the moment I step in there, I've got a smile on my face because it reminds me of home. Try to get there before 8pm because things typically start to slow down after, but just go, you wont be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Not too sure what to think about this place the Greek restaurant trying to be fine dining maybe 20 years ago it was but today standards not really the prices are not too bad until you get them the portion sizes are super small so it's and you really paying double the price because of this start off with the hummus very small portion literally it's like 3 tablespoons and two pieces of bread we have to order more bread and whatever they charge you the flavor was pretty plain who didn't have their pomegranate sauce on it it would have been really Bland I got some lamb dish can't remember the name of it but basically was lamb rice and tomato sauce pretty small Ramekin that was okay I like the lamb it wasn't too gamey the rice with it was cooked perfectly but not a whole lot of flavored and flavors what you expect from Greek food or any foods in the Middle East lots of spices in oil always fantastic but they missed it here maybe they're trying me to Americanized not sure so after hummus and the lamb dish I was still hungry was going to get a dessert baklava until they told me that $6 price for one triangle so it half a piece of baklava one bite I guess not server is pretty cool though laid back met some good recommendations few things you told me not to get but overall it was okay may try it again in the future not sure yet"}
{"text":"The best Greek food this side of Greece... enough said about food! The Waiter Dwayne gave exceptional service! I even personally met the owners, Tony & Susan who were most gracious! I highly recommend it if you are looking for a delicious Greek food experience in Phoenix"}
{"text":"What a great an unexpected change from the chain restaurant overdone landscape of Arizona. This place was amazing. The owners personally came out and spent some time with us, which made us feel at home. The calamari was crusted perfectly which gave it the right texture. My personal favorite was the rack of lamb which was cooked and seasoned nicely. I was pleasantly surprised by how inexpensive their wine list was, including several Greek wines that are difficult to find. Our waiter Zefer was entertaining and not afraid to make some recommendations: Order the flaming cheese appetizer you won't regret it. It's flat out just a great spot."}
{"text":"Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.

  My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold. 
No bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.  
There were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.

When a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, \"thank you.\"  All the \"Best of Phoenix\" favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old.
The bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird.
We vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town. 
Save your money."}
{"text":"This was the worst Greek restaurant I ever  experienced in my life. Very small portions and their prices are sky high.  I came from Chicago 12 years ago and I can't believe that Arizona still doesn't have a descent Greek restaurant. My advice is just go to Greek festivals and eat the real stuff. Or save some money and visit Chicago or even Greece. But  please don't waste your time and money to go to this place."}
{"text":"I love Greekfest.  It's the best Greek food that I have tasted in Phoenix.  Everything was very flavorful! Great portions for the price.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow I feel sorry for this place. I went in on a Thursday night for a quick salad. The place was empty, only one other table. I got a greekfest salad. It was small had one olive and one onion slice and 3 pics of lamb meat for 12 bucks. 

I even got charged for the pita bread and tzitki sauce.

Wow out the door for 20 dollars. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know how this is the best Greek in Phoenix.   This place is horrid.  I'm so use to fantastic Greek food in Chicago.   Everything didn't taste like it should.   Will not be coming back here.  Ever!  Don't wast your time."}
{"text":"Tony and Susan have made their mark in the Biltmore restaurant scene with Greekfest. I used to live in the area for about 4 years before moving back to the midwest and Greekfest was a place I could come to, to treat myself for any celebration I deemed necessary. My wife and I had our first \"business date\" here and the rest is history. We were in the early planning stages with Susan to have our wedding here, but certain circumstances had everything move to the east coast. 

On my first visit here back in 2006, my parents and I learned that Tony brought all his herbs from Greece and transplanted them here. You can taste the difference in the food and realize that this is not your run of the mill Greek restaurant you can find just about anywhere in the US. Tony thought about the texture and taste to each dish on the menu. I believe I have just had about everything on the menu during my 4 year residence there and everything had a unique and distinct taste from the last meal. My Yiayia always used to make me, my brother and my cousins beautiful food and I always would set the standards by her TLC cooking. Tony, does the same. The amount of TLC he puts into his food is unmatchable.

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful. We also learned on our first visit, that he brought back as much copper and tin items that he could when he immigrated over. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with the items and the white table cloths and walls bring you to the islands of the Agean sea. I could always feel transplated when I would step through the door.

During your meal service from the exceptional serving staff, Susan makes the rounds to the each table getting to know everyone on a personal level. Over the four years, we have gotten to know each other as well as we could from those 5 minute conversations, but she is able to recall what we spoke of the last time. That is hard to find these days. Someone that listens.

I wish this place much success and when I am back in Phoenix, I can not wait to give them another visit and feel like I am sitting in Yiayia's kitchen eating the food I grew up loving.

By the way, ask for a bag of kourabedis before you leave ;)."}
{"text":"This is truly a mom and pop run delight. Did you know the ma actually cooks all food in the kitchen and it is delectable? There are flavors I've had here I haven't enjoyed since living in Greece."}
{"text":"Greekfest has something that drives it to the top of my lunch list:  friendly, warm wait staff, cook and owners who remember my name every time I go.  This is why you return to a place - it's not so much the food or the ambiance, but how you are made to feel when you walk in, and Greek Fest needs to file a patent, because they have it.  The authentic delicious Greek food is an added value.  The mousaka and youvetsi defninitely shine here, as does the curious greek salad with the peppery, sharp taste.  Don't be shy - order what the Greeks eat, and leave the gyro alone."}
{"text":"Our dinner club went to this restaurant last week and I will start out with the positive. The inside was very charming and lovely. Our waiter could not have been nicer. Unfortunately he was overwhelmed. There were two large parties in the restaurant on a Saturday night and two tables of two people. Obviously the parties were reserved so they should have been aware of what kind of wait staff they needed also kitchen staff. We were in the restaurant for three hours and the food was horrible. I was drinking water and it has such a foul taste I put lemons in it and I now realize it was in a copper pitcher so maybe that was it. Before I realize this I switch to ice tea which was served in tiny little glasses. One of the women asked for a picture to be put on the table since two sips and the Glass was empty. The waiter replied that he was not allowed to leave the pitchers on the table because they were valuable. One gal ordered a Diet Coke and nearly spit it out.... when the waiter was told he said oh yeah our carbon dioxide doesn't work well in the soda drinks. The lemon soup was delicious but it was about a third of a cup to a half a cup serving in a tiny little bowl. The vegetable soup had no taste and again a very small portion. The main course was about $14 and came in a small bowl. It had a nasty flavor unlike similar I have tasted. I have been there twice now the first and last time!"}
{"text":"We came in sorta late for a Tuesday and even though it was only us the place was great and didn't feel empty. The owner of the restaurant chatted with us for a while and so did the chef! The waiter recommended a really good Greek beer and it went well with the salad and the food was yummy. I am definitely going back"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, very comfortable decor, and delicious food!  I enjoyed a sampling of a few different mezes and a greek salad - just wonderful!"}
{"text":"I love walking into a restaurant and being enticed by the aroma of good food.  We had a light dinner. Hummus and pitas. Gyros. Hypocrites salad. Followed by a desert that I can't even begin to pronounce. Everything was very good, and I loved the normal portion sizes.  

Our waiter was superior.  Attentive, yet not too.  I'd love service like this everywhere."}
{"text":"My friend Christos from Thessalonika (Greece) took my friends and I here when he was in town and ordered half the menu items. It was fantastic. Christos said it's the best Greek food in the city."}
{"text":"Traditional Greek food, and all was delicious!!  The staff was welcoming, knowledgeable, and helpful from start to finish.  We shared various appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts and everything was great (okay the shrimp might have been slightly over).,  but we will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Greek food and ambience. The owner came and chatted with us for a while."}
{"text":"There is a reason this restaurant has been voted the \"Best Greek Restaurant in Phoenix\" for 23 years. It is wonderful! Phoenix has a pretty vibrant (and highly competitive) restaurant scene with many excellent options. It's unfortunate that many of our long-standing establishments are overlooked by those trying to patronize the latest trendy restaurant. 

We made reservations, but sadly they really weren't needed.  The entire time we were there, there were only 2 other tables of customers. Greekfest doesn't have the best street visibility, so perhaps that is why. Or, maybe it was just an off night or perhaps we were there too early in the evening. The d√©cor has a definite Greek island influence, white and blue and very crisp feeling and we were warmly welcomed and seated.

Our server came over and welcomed us, asked if we had any questions, and took our drink order. The Greeks have had 3,000 yrs. to perfect their culinary expertise, and Greekfest prides itself on theirs. The menu is almost overwhelming, and then there are the specials! Our waiter rattled off several specials, all of which sounded scrumptious! Decisions, decisions. I don't think you could go wrong with anything (unless you don't like eggplant like me).  We started with the Trypoites (Greek cheeses & herbs in phyllo). Off to a great start as they were yummy. Entrees included the lamb shank special which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious - perfectly prepared. Ditto for the lamb souvlaki! Our waiter suggested a Greek red wine (Amethystos) to accompany our meal. Never had a Greek wine before and was pleasantly surprised. The portions were so generous, there was no room for dessert. Next time for sure!

Our experience at Greekfest was wonderful from the moment we walked through the door. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable; they sincerely act as if they are welcoming you into their home. Very nice, authentic ambience.  Most importantly...the food was awesome! That's what we want when we dine out, right? 

Do not, do not - drive by this place when you want authentic Greek food. This is a great spot for two, four or fourteen. Support this local restaurant instead of a national chain - taste the difference!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant we have found in the area.  Just a warning that the menu on Yelp is not accurate.  We specifically came here because the menu (on Yelp) showed that they had Kolokithakia Skordalia (which no other Greek restaurants in the area seem to have).  However, it was not on the menu in the restaurant.  But... they agreed to make it for us, and it was excellent!  Everything was delicious, and the owner was very friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"I've been delaying this review, partially because I did not want to relive the experience and partially because the owner is so nice that I didn't want to say anything bad about her restaurant.
But...
My experience was horrible.
I had gone to Greekfest with my parents when I was younger and I loved it. My parents had nothing nice to say, but for me it was the greatest. I was 12 years old and not paying for it, which might be the difference. It has apparently not changed in that many years.
I went on a Tuesday evening with a fiend of mine for what was to be a three hour long ordeal, not because we were having a laid back, relaxing dinner, but because the restaurant could not handle being \"slammed\" on a weeknight. The truth is that there was a group (who had made a reservation) and one other table when we walked in. Even when the group had gone and we were left there all on our own, the service was horrendous.
The hummus was alright, but we were charged for the accompanying pita. I thought, given the price of the entrees, the pita could have been included.
I ordered the swordfish and a friend ordered lamb, I think. They were out of both. I ended up with the salmon and she had the steak. While she enjoyed her steak, I feel like I could have had better salmon in my own kitchen. It was overly spiced, and drowned in sauce. There was no taste of salmon to be found.
The desert was not as great as I remembered, but they sure are pretty. We had the galatabouriko, my favorite. We also chose a fig desert, which was a little grainy.
The whole ordeal came to about $90 plus tip. Usually a good tipper, I left an appallingly low tip to make a point.
Occupying the only table in the restaurant, we should have had better service. Toward the end it seemed like a joke. We stared at the owner and waiter waiting for the check, and then had to wait another twenty minutes for them to pick it up before we finally went up to the front to pay ourselves.
I won't be back. I won't tell other people to go.
The atmosphere was nice, but they seriously need to improve the quality of the food and the service before they can charge the amount they do.
The two stars I left were for my friend's meal, the physical ambiance, and nostalgia, along with my hopes that the owner will read this review and improve the restaurant."}
{"text":"Christmas party at Greekfest. I had the steak and my wife had the salmon. I suppose it is possible that they were having a bad night but everything seemed nearly flavorless.

None of it was good.

The desert was about the only thing worth having.

The atmosphere was great and the staff was helpful but they need to rework the kitchen if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"We love Greek food and have eaten it all over the world - including Greece....  This wasn't all that impressive.  First clue should have been that the place was virtually empty on a Saturday night....  Calamari was mediocre - definitely had much better elsewhere.  We can make Tzatziki that is equivalent or better in quality.  Moussaka was a huge disappointment - dry, undercooked eggplant...  Best dish was marinated swordfish - but definitely not worth $18..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendliness of the owners - who visited my table personally.  My server was very efficient and had my meal out quickly.  The taste was very good and I enjoyed it very much.  I would go back again for the food, ambience and experience."}
{"text":"We ordered in from Greekfest yesterday and I was underwhelmed.

Most notably, they delivered quite possibly the worst Avgolemono soup I've ever ingested in my life.  It was pretty bad.  The rest of the food was ok but very pricey given the portions.

I'm crossing them out."}
{"text":"Ok.... Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The only thing that was decent about this place was the waiter. Neither of us liked the food, and when we sent one of the dishes back, the owner comes out and to talk to us.She was very nice but clearly took offense to us sending the food back.  The decor is authentic and the atmosphere is great, however the food was not appealing to me or my partner who LOVES greek food. Lastly I would say that they are overpriced for the portions of food. (all of ours went to the dog....she wouldn't eat the stuff either!)"}
{"text":"The server was horrendous. Worst service i've ever received. Think his name was Jeff?  Very pushy, very edgy. Made a lot of inappropriate comments to my business partner and I. Server thought it was a date and made comments about our luncheon. Seemed to be very twitchy and wouldn't make eye contact with us. Even approached me after all was said and done to ask for a job because \"who knows when this place will close down.\" Yeah...REALLY professional man. 

The food was hit and miss but the value wasn't there. I ordered the lamb meatball salad (unsure of the appropriate name) and I received 4 meatballs on shredded lettuce. For $14 I expect more than that! There's nothing else on there. 

The appetizer was great! Pita chips with the roasted eggplant dip. Amazing! Pricey for what we received but tasted great. 

Disappointed that we weren't more well educated on the menu and what it had to offer. Would have loved to hear more about each dish and recommendations.

Might return, but, won't be served by Jeff."}
{"text":"The decor of Greekfest was great and really gave the feeling of being in a restaurant on one of the Greek islands.  We had the Spanakopites and Arnopites for appetizers and they were wonderful.  Then for dinner we had the Ravioli dish and the stuffed chicken breast dish and they too were out of this world.  Then for dessert, we had the Baklava which is a must for any Greek restaurant and Greekfest's Baklava was really really good.  Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to go back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Sorry... didn't care for the server, perhaps cultural differences got in the way.  Food was just okay, we ordered a lot, I only cared for the calamari - and I am Greek.  They don't carry most of the wines on their list, so that was how we got started, trying to figure out what they had and what we wanted.  Music was not traditional Greek music.  Place is authentically decorated, but I have no desire to go back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"The food is not authentic Greek food.  My mother was from Greece, so, I have tasted the real thing.  This is an expensive imitation.

The Avgolemono soup was ok.  The Tzatziki was good.  My Hippocrates salad was fresh, but, overpriced, especially since the smoked salmon was frozen.  The desserts are ok, not as rich as my mother's.  The one dish that was very disappointing was the Spanakopites.  Not only did it not have enough cheese, it tasted funny and made both of us sick.

We got there at 5 PM on Friday evening.  We were the only two customers in the restaurant until 6:15 PM.  Not very busy for a Friday evening.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for many years. As a resident of Northern California, I have dined in many of this countries most acclaimed restaurants. I LOVE this place. It is like dining in the home of friends. Tony and Susan pour their hearts and souls into every aspect of this establishment. The rack of lamb I had last night was simply the best ever. Great service, impeccably clean top to bottom, and food from the heart of Tony and his imported, one of a kind oven (ask for a glimpse. It's really something) I can't recommend this place highly enough. Thank you Susan and Tony for the warmth and excellence!!! We eagerly await our next visit!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent service. Great food. And it looks like Greece inside. Beautiful, very nice dining. I always eat lunch, but I really want to return for dinner and have wine. I love everything I have had. Saganaki (Opa!), salads, spanakopita, and baklava. It's a great find. Hidden gem. Great for a date. Great for lunch."}
{"text":"Great for date nights, and special celebrations.  Gorgeous atmosphere, friendly staff, upscale (but healthy) and DELICIOUS food. A++ LOVE that the portions are normal sized instead of fattening super sized like most restaurants. You come in, eat a normal sized, healthy, delicious meal and go home feeling satisfied and content. If you like fine wines they have an huge selection of choices for you that are hard to find elsewhere. And if you do want to splurge on calories I highly recommend the saganaki (it's a yummy splurge and my kids LOVE that they set it on fire with a flourish and an \"Ompah!\").  

(Also have lots of gluten free choices - do you know how hard it is to find an upscale restaurant that's mostly gluten free?)  Love it!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the whole Phoenix area!

I have friends from Greece who won't eat at any other Greek restaurant in town -- ONLY Greekfest!

When the natives tell me it's the absolute best, and my mouth agrees with them, who am I to argue - either with my friends or with my mouth???"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I went to Greece about a year and half ago and have been looking for a good Greek place in town and I have found it... GREAT service, from the owner herself, fresh products and JUST GREAT GREAT GREAT! I don't recommend food lightly and this place is top notch! Portions were not small... and have great dessert! 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"How this place stays in business I have no idea. Food is gross,  the place is empty all the time, small dishes, over priced. Service is totally crap. The parking lot  looks like a place one could get raped in. If you're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building. Pot holes everywhere, I can't believe they haven't been sued yet for the condition of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Wonderful old school Greek.  Very friendly staff, you're treated like family.  The decor is wonderful I wanted to take a shopping bag of various items to decorate my place!  Food is great, saganaki is perfect, and the small plate gyros taverna was just right.  Hummus was excellent.  The Greek coffee looks wonderful but I passed.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife on Wednesday and enjoyed it. I ordered the swordfish, she had the kabobs, and we had hummus for an appetizer. 

The place is set back off Camelback a bit and I've just never noticed it. Went to the BofA over the weekend and \"found\" it when parking behind the building. 

That said the exterior is nice, white and traditional Greek looking. The place was completely empty when we walked in. Not one other person or coupe eating lunch there. My wife mentioned she saw a take out order, but only one other couple came while we were there which is a bit unusual, especially after tasting the food. 

To start with the hummus was slightly odd to both of us. She's Indian so perhaps it's just not her style, but it was a little bland and one dimensional, but the pita bread was very soft and fresh. 

The swordfish came chopped on a bed of salad and was great. I should've got the dressing on the side as traditional Greek they put way too much for my liking :)

Her kabobs were great also, as was the salad, with again quite a bit of dressing again (realizing others may really prefer this). 

Will definitely go back, and they cater also so we would certainly consider them for an event. With the nice Greek decor I'd even consider an event on premise."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. 
Our waiter was wonderful and very personable.
We ordered octopus and it was BURNED. Pita bread, every other piece BURNED. Okay, there is still time to redeem themselves. On to main course of chicken soulvaki...let's just say burned is an understatement. More like cremated chicken. Rice was soggy, eggplant was greasy and soggy.
$70.00 later we walked out hungry and irritated. It should have been a warning sign that on a Friday night there were two tables occupied, including ours. It was simply uneatable. Needless to say, we won't be returning there. I just wish I took pictures, because it's hard to believe what they served us."}
{"text":"My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made. 

The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have known about this place for years, but just went for the first time last week as a default when we discovered that the Big Fat whatchamacallit place across the street had closed. What a nice surprise. The staff was very friendly although they hovered a bit too much for my liking. The food was spectacular, and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from (although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian, but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes). The array of desserts was to die for. My main complaint? Pricey like woah. And it was sneaky pricey. There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each, with a $9 appetizer, 3 desserts, cocktails, etc. and the bill was over $160!!! I thought my poor boyfriend was going to crap himself.  I honestly don't know how it got that expensive. The drinks? The desserts? Were the baskets of pita $8 apiece? I mean, a Greek meal costing  more than a steak extravaganza at Cork and Cleaver? Come on. While all three of us just loved it (a rarity, as we are all differently picky), at that price, it's going to have to be reserved for special occasions. Sheesh!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelp reviews and close proximity lead us to choose the restaurant for dinner a few nights back. The service was phenomenal, the food was delicious and the overall experience was incredible. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive but amazing food! The portions were small so those who shared a dish didn't get a decent size meal like you would at other places."}
{"text":"THEY ARE OPEN FOR LUNCH!  I just wanted to help them out by saying that, because I dropped in at lunch and there were no customers. Yes, it looks like a dinner place, but you can just drop in and get a quality, affordable salad like I did.  The owner was pleasant and even came over to chit chat. I thought the place looked so beautiful just like a Greek restaurant should look like.  It was clean, organized and beautifully white with beautiful dinner ware set on every table. I will plan on bringing my family in on my next visit to Phoenix. I wish I lived in town because I would come in on the weekends for sure."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this restaurant! Admittedly it's been 10+ years since I moved out of the area and haven't been back. So when I found myself in the neighborhood at lunchtime, I jumped on the opportunity. The empty parking lot should have been my first clue. Or perhaps the fact that we were the only patrons in the entire restaurant... I guess I got carried away with nostalgia. Let me implore you- don't fall for it. My sister ordered the lamb salad medium rare. It arrived with a few gnarled pieces of lamb - over cooked and over spiced (heavy on the allspice) served over an overdressed bed of romaine lettuce with a couple underripe pieces of tomato. My Greek salad and arnopites (lamb stuffed phyllo triangles) combo wasn't much better. It's like they threw her lamb in the blender and wrapped it up in phyllo. :-(  It's like losing an old friend, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"OPA!

As if dining on the Mediterranean itself, more than just going out for dinner, Greekfest is an ethnic experience.  Marathon lengths have been overcome to solidify Greek authenticity.  The owner ensures a personal experience by often stepping from the kitchen to visit guest at their table; educating about the Greek experience or just making sure everyone is happy.  The saganaki is made with kefalograviera cheese which is what was originally intended; also offering an exclusive sausage saganaki.  Directly importing ouzo from Greece these labels will not be found at Total Wine or BevMo.  Avgolemono soup; if you can't pronounce it, just ask for \"the lemon soup\", they'll know what you mean.  More than once I've filled up on appetizers, soup and ouzo, keeping the tab less than a ticket to Athens."}
{"text":"WOW one of the WORST meals I have ever had anywhere in the world.  Stopped for lunch today as I was in the neighborhood.  Had a greek salad with lamb in phylo dough.  The salad looked like it had been reclaimed from someone else's plate the two phylo dough tasted burnt on the exterior while the filling was burnt.  Unable to get the taste from my mouth.
Rating of NEGATIVE 5 stars is more appropriate"}
{"text":"Perhaps I was possessed.  Perhaps I was having a moment of Hellenic pride.  Maybe I wanted to feel like I was on the island of Chios smelling the marina and humming along with all the traditional anthems.  Perhaps I was hoping to break a few plates after toasting a wonderful plate of desperately sought out seafood in the desert.  I am not sure what it was that night I simply had to have Greek food. I had a dream is more than an ABBA greek tribute.  But here is my reality...

Having recieved awesome directions not thanks to my Garmin which placed the restuarant to the right versus the left off 19th and Camelback, but from the owner's wife, I pulled into an empty Tuesday night parking lot about an hour and a half before closing.  Perhaps this was my very first mistake but with this economy, I realized that the place might have been hurting more than my yearning for horiatiki and tzatziki.  Still, the women's voice was alluring and authentic and promising.

Enter stage left, a host.  Truly, I thought  that I was part of an elaborate prop set for what would be a Greek tragedy.  The place is certainly capable visually of transporting you to Ellada.  The place was also as barren as an off season tourist trap near Plakka.  The two other people there seemed to be regulars.

I admit that I was VERY impressed with the menu.  Again promising.  I went ahead and ordered Ktopodi traditional and kalamarakia.  Homemade bread that was made the last time the restaurant was full appeared at the table with sweet butter that was also frozen at that same time.  A wine list featuring more Greek wines than anyplace else was also promising, but I knew I would have a long drive back and well, you know me and that speeding thing on Interstate 17...I digress...

After waiting for almost 25 minutes, I got one tentacle of  what must have been the world's smallest octopus and that octopus was suffering from anorexia.  It was camoflauged in a sea of fava bean paste to give it a fuller appearance.  It was dry and not tasty.  To be more clear... imagine a child's finger being grilled and placed in front of you after being dehydrated.  Yea.  That is what it was like.

The salad was fair.Meek, but fair.  Nothing to really yelp about.  The kalamarakia were horrid.  I think they were anything but fresh as they were laden in overly fried onions and sopping in oil with the breading stripping away.  I must have been desperate for the fruit of Poseiden to be enticed in any way to put a forkfull of this stuff in my mouth.  It was the absolute worse that I have ever experienced.  Hands down.  

I am certain from the many posted accolades all over the walls of the place, that the GreekFest was indeed great.  But its day has come and gone and its legendary service and cuisine is all but a page of mythology.  I was extremely disappointed.  I am only giving two stars because the server was ok and the setting and music was so authentic.  I can only beg the Marvrides to consider a return themselves to their heritage of excellence that seems now so far away."}
{"text":"Took my wife to the Greekfest for her birthday and she loved it.  Great service, good food, not crowded or loud. We will be back with family and friends."}
{"text":"We were celebrating my husband's birthday and Father's Day combined and I had make a reservation ahead of time via Open Table.  I mentioned that we'd like a quiet table as my parents have some trouble hearing.  So wonderful to be greeted as we came in the door and to have our request acknowledged!  The lovely owner/hostess mentioned that she had selected our table personally based on our request and offered others if we didnt like it - so nice!  Sometimes those requests fall into the black hole so it was wonderful to be treated like a special guest.

We had eaten here before and were looking forward to all the wonderful food and were not disappointed - everything was delicious - moussaka, calamari, saganaki, gyros plate - all great!  The bread is very special too - I think it has a touch of anise.

Our waiter was very attententive and made us feel special!  Thank you for a lovely evening and we're so happy we chose Greekfest for our celebration!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant in town. A true authentic Greek bar. The owner personally greets all patrons. She is wonderful. The bar is truly Mediterranean. Don't pass up the rotisseries. They all rock."}
{"text":"I posted the following review on Rewards Network and received the following response which given the circumstances was actually enough for me to decide to not return to this establishment. While the food is good and our waiter was good the responder is a piece of work. It should be known that my service animal was wearing a vest with an insignia on it. The question should have been answered just by that. The fact that I and anyone in ear shot could hear her was calling undue attention. Whatever the health codes etc are the ADA is VERY CLEAR and this restaurant is this/close to violating that act. 

----review and response below.......
The restaurant service and food were really good. Everything tasted fine and was presented beautifully. The drawbacks were just minor but they added up...as did the bill. Our waiter was friendly efficient and left us to our devices while we ate after he checked on how we liked things. He did however take a long time to bring the bill. The drawbacks were as follows: We have a service dog and they made a bigger fuss than necessary. We could hear a woman (I am assuming the owner) asking repeatedly if the Maitre d'hotel checked to make certain she was a service dog. He assured her several times, yet she loudly asked him again to verify it. Had the restaurant been crowded it would have been embarrassing enough for me to consider leaving. It is really no one's business besides mine that I have a service animal. Not that I can hide it, but the woman made it seem as though she doubted my disability and or need. The prices were pretty high for what was served. I think 2 people should be able to leave a Greek restaurant for under $60 a person even with wine appetizers desert and coffee. We didn't order the most expensive wine either. Just a Greek Rhoditis. Ultimately I would probably go back but I might try other places first. Being a former Chicago resident a lot of places I go to for Greek food end up being compared to the phenomenal restaurants one finds in Greek Town there. 

The establishment replied to this comment on 06.28.2014:
We regret that you felt the response to your dog was \"over the top\" - however, as the Health Dept is adamant about no dogs other than genuine service dogs in a food establishment - it was necessary to determine that the server had the correct information.. Your server was not a maitre d'hotel and as there have been language barriers that resulted in miscommunication in the past it was important to ensure there was no misunderstanding. There were other issues that unfortunately you were not aware of. We have had many, many diners with service dogs and as well, we have had guests who have \"laughingly\" called their pets \"service\" dogs. In the interests of meeting strict health code parameters it is better to err on the side of caution. We are here to provide a healthy environment and will continue to strive to surpass these expectations regarding both the environment and of course the food. We thank you for taking the time to share your comments. SM"}
{"text":"It was totally empty to begin with but that's okay went in for lunch with my daughter we were excited to try a new Greek restaurant! And we ordered several different dishes to share and one by one they got worse and worse we both think the health department needs to be contacted there was rancid walnuts in our salad the oil and vinegar bottle was covered with hair and dust like its been sitting for ever I have no idea what they do in that kitchen but it was disgusting to stay the very least! We started looking around and it  was very very dirty...  We had to send back even the salad which smelt like dirty sponges maybe they dryer the lettuce leaves off with a used wet towel in the kitchen...  it was so gross .We will never go back cannot even imagine that they're even still open!!!! :(
EXTREMELY  DISAPPOINTED! !!"}
{"text":"Holy mackarel! I can't believe no one has reviewed Greekfest yet!!  Greekfest is the best restaurant. It's not that easy to find and you'll probably drive past it once or twice before you spot it tucked back a little ways off of Camelback road.  The thing I love about this place is how authentic it is. You feel like you're really in Greece when you eat there, not Arizona and the food is as authentic as it gets. 

Try the Youvetsi, Cypriot Ravioli, shrimp souvlaki, tyropites, spanakopites and the feta cheese and olives- all are delicious!  It can get a little pricey, but it will be worth every bite!"}
{"text":"Back for our annual vacation dinner at Greekfest. As before, we started with some Retsina white wine and the antipasto appetizer (which comes with warm pita wedges). The antipasto (described as: \"Taramosalata, Melintzanosalata, Tzatziki, Homous, Dolmathes, Feta Cheese, Fasolia, Kalamata olives and sweet onions\") is a terrific sampler for two, and highly recommended. The Greek salad was also excellent, while the Steak Makedonias (filet mignon with reduced cabernet-pomegranate sauce) was tasty, but a little dry at the edges -- they recommended medium-rare, but I ordered it medium, and the result was more like medium-well. And filet mignon is probably not a Greek specialty. However, my girlfriend's calamari was delicious.

I'm already looking forward to next year...."}
{"text":"This was such a fantastic find, tucked away in the heart of the Biltmore area! 

My fianc√© and I hadn't had Greek food since we moved to Phoenix nearly a year ago, so when I stumbled upon this spot on OpenTable, I knew we had to visit.

We arrived a little before 7:00 PM on a Friday and were surprised to find ourselves the only patrons there. I realize that it's tucked away in a business plaza off of Camelback, but it was still a shock to walk into a completely empty restaurant.

As far as ambience and aesthetics go, this place is A+++. As someone who has always wanted to travel to Greece, I adored the decor and Grecian pieces throughout the restaurant.

Service was impeccable. While I know they weren't busy, our server was very attentive without being intrusive to our space. Two thumbs up!

From the appetizers to the dessert, the food was delicious! We went with the hummus and tzatkiki  (sp?) app to start. It was splendid and was served with warm, fresh pita bread. For dinner, we split the Greekfest salad and the Lemon Chicken, wow! Unique lemony and mint flavors permeated the chicken and the salad was fresh and of good size.

We went with this custard pastry for dessert, I forget the Grecian name for it but it was amazing and melted in our mouths.. Had hints of cinnamon and honey and was served warmed.

There seemed to be many awards and newspaper/magazine articles throughout the restaurant from 10-15 years ago, commending the restaurant and ranking it as one of the top in the valley. With our service and great food, I can't understand why more folks weren't here on a Friday night, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with high hopes after having poor luck finding good Greek food since moving to Phoenix. I only ordered pita bread and the chicken avgolemono soup. The pita bread was fresh, which I appreciated. However, the flavor of the soup was truly offensive. Though I can't comment on the quality of the rest of the menu, for such a staple (and simple) dish to be such a disappointment, I don't anticipate I will be back to try any other dishes.

Otherwise, the decor inside was nice and I found the service acceptable."}
{"text":"Greekfest is the best Greek restaurant in the Metropolitan area of Phoenix, hands down. We've been to them all - and we keep coming back to Greekfest on Camelback. Tony and Sue have been there forever - and there's a reason for that - the food is the best.  

By the way - my wife is Greek - related to John Stamos the actor. We have eaten Greek food in Greece including her home town near Argos, and Greekfest is one of the few restaurants we've been to in the US that recreates the atmosphere and flavor of our times there. Some may find the food challenging - but that's because Tony makes it authentic - with sharp garlic tasting Skordalia and other delicacies that taste different from American food.  If you know Greek food - you will love Greekfest.

Where does one start when it's all so good?  The dips, the octopus, the lamb...all excellent. The mixed dip appetizer is a work of art that includes all your favorites including dolmades to die for. My favorite is the fried smelts - which are cooked to perfection - but they are not available in every season. Everything with lamb is spectacular. The lamb meatballs have an intricate yet overwhelming taste that reminds me of that old saying...there are two kinds of people in the world, Greeks and those who want to be Greek. After tasting the meatballs, the sausage saganaki, the lamb...you'll wish you were Greek, too. Second best is eating at Greekfest Opa! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for lunch three times recently and have been impressed each time. They have great salads and affordable prices for lunch. They also have some pretty decent appetizers on the menu.There is construction going on in the area and they're not easy to see from the street but they are definitely worth the trip.

I love the Decour of this restaurant. Very beautiful interior makes you feel like you are in Greece. Definitely looks like an upscale restaurant with pretty reasonable prices. They also have a full bar in the restaurant.

When I was there they were not very busy for lunch. Service was very quick and friendly. Every time I went there to eat the owner came out to make sure everything was good."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea what some of these reviews are referring to. My father in law is full blooded Greek, and we have eaten at numerous Greek restaurants throughout the greater LA area, and this place was one of the best I've ever had. The server was very friendly, but to be honest my yelp reviews are 90 percent based off of the food. We ordered a house salad, and he recommended we share one because it was enough for two and we still couldn't finish it. My husband is 6'4 and a big eater, portion size is not an issue here. The server explained that the gyro taverna is a plate of gyro meat not a gyro pita. They have a gyro pita option if you want it served in pita like a taco. I'm obsessed with quality moussaka, it's my go to. The cook had the server come tell me that their lamb is robust and heavy on the allspice WHICH IS GREAT. The moussaka comes out in a stone roasting dish like a le creuset. It was DELICIOUS- but if you don't like clove or all spice ... traditional moussaka just isn't your dish. Hubbys gyro was tender, not dry. We ordered the galaktoboureko, and it was just as satisfying. It's a custard baked in phyllo dough, and we had the house roasted coffee. As in, they roast their own beans!We are definitely coming back, and will bring his Dad to try the Pastitsio."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the calamari and came with rice and eggplant slice. Very delicious and the waiter did a great job!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Greek Food offered with Excellent Service in an authentic setting, unfortunately very overpriced.  Difficult to enjoy a proper meal for under $100 for two people.  We may be back, but only on special occasions.  We'd be regulars if prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I don't know if all of these positive ratings are of the owners' friends, or do these people really not know what food is. This place was awful. Do not waste your money only to go hungry.

I lived in Chicago and grew up in Greek Town with real Greek food. I even traveled to Greece and I could say I am very well-rounded of Greek food--this restaurant is a disgrace and humiliation for the Greeks and I honestly don't understand how they are still standing.

The place was empty when we walked in and smelled like an old attic. We went there for mom's birthday and ordered 4 dishes and 1 salad:

1. Youvetsi $14.00 - my dad ordered this lamb dish, only to be ridiculed by a creme-brulee-sized bowl with just a couple pieces of lamb in there--not even enough to feed a baby. Embarrassing. Do not order this dish. My dad is over 250lbs and was served this pathetic dish, the waiter could have at least told us what to expect 

2. Chicken lemonato $18 -served in a sushi-plate-sized plate. Look up this dish on Google. I guarantee it does not look like that. This dish is traditionally served as 1-2 whole chicken breasts stuffed with spinach and feta. What my mom got was a joke. Not to mention 3 tablespoons of some nasty sweet rice which I never seen made in Greece ever. Disgusting

3. Chicken souvkaki $15 - another sad \"sushi plate\" with the nasty rice. This was about 5 tiny pieces of chicken. I never seen souvlaki prepared this way in my life

4. Gryos - never seen Gyros prepared this way in my life. Does not come with Pita bread. Only meat, tomatoes,  and tzatziki sauce.  We paid extra for some cold pita bread.

Cucumber tomato salad waiter said was big to share --barely enough for 1 person. Nothing special 

Bread served before meal was not fresh and crispy as is served in real Greek restaurants 

Was served gross tap water

The restaurant is lucky we did not complain or return our food. We were very unhappy. Paid $60-$70 only to go home hungry. Will never come here again. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE"}
{"text":"I ordered take out 30 minutes before closing, and the gentleman working was kind. That's the only reason I didn't leave one star. $22 for 3 prawns with a lackluster side of rice and eggplant. Also ordered the chicken lemon soup, which was watery with little rice and no chicken or seasoning. Zero flavor and $6 for a small cup. Haven't tried the rice pudding dessert yet, but by looks it's not worth $7.50 (and appears burnt on top). The shrimp was yummy, but for $22 one would hope to get more than 3. The soup was a waste. Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"We've now been to Greekfest a half dozen times. Basically any time we go through Phoenix. The food is authentic and everything is homemade. The place is a bit pricey, say $40 per person but very good. We have had most everything on the menu by now and it's all good. As others have posted, you can't go wrong with the lamb."}
{"text":"What a fun dining experience. We were a group of nine and they could not have been more accommodating and fun. Several specific food needs were not a problem and enjoyable  suggestions offered. Great food selections and wine pairings.  Don't miss the greekfest ravioli, spanakopita, baklava and the lamb exohiko. Our
waiters were wonderful and kept us laughing the whole meal. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Poor service (understaffed, waited 30 minutes to get a drink order in, didn't come to check after food delivery...), overpriced menu, food was ok at best ( salad tasted like a packaged mix, under/over-cooked main courses, baklava tastes like plastic). The ice/water tastes like machine hasn't been cleaned in years and the soda was flat. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. I threw a surprise birthday party for my sister at Greekfest and it was absolutely wonderful. One of the owners, Susan - worked with me to perfect the event - which included constant and clear communication, recommendations, working within my budget and making sure all guests would be happy. She even helped me coordinate parking for guests as this was a surprise party!
The Space - ARE WE IN SANTORINI? The interior of the restaurant looks just like something you would find in Greece. They even had a concert pianist playing! 
The Food - The food is authentic and delicious! We went to Greece last year and found all of the same, authentic foods on the menu at Greekfest. Everything is fresh and tastes amazing!
The Staff - Susan and her staff are wonderful. Like I said before, Susan really helped make this party amazing! The customer service was like any other I have ever had in Phoenix! Our waiter Zephyr paid great attention to detail, made sure the guests had everything they needed and was very professional.

Can't wait to come back for lunch of dinner!"}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to love this place, but that was not the case. I had seen this restaurant featured on 'Check Please Arizona' and because it is within close proximity to my house, I thought I would give it a try. First, the appetizer platter was not great.  The hummus was below average, the tzatziki was ok, the babaganoush was not good at all, and the pureed pink caviar was too awful to stomach.  The platter was over priced and the amount of food was small.  Next, I ordered the shrimp saganaki, which was pretty good, but again, small and over priced ($14 for an appetizer of 5 shrimp). The pita bread was actually very good, however. My companion got a salad with smoked salmon and she didn't enjoy it at all and told the server she didn't like it and he said well that was the description on the menu... and did not offer her anything else or take the uneaten salad off the bill. Our drinks ran dry and the service was terrible.  I will not be back. Across the street is a place called cyprus grill, it is a lot better than this place."}
