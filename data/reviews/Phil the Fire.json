{"text":"Went on my birthday and it was the most horrific experience EVER!  

Every step was a HUGE wait and still get it WRONG cluster F@#*

I was so very angry...the owner (Phil), his GM and waitstaff person came to our table to apologize. I told them, flat out, we were greatly disappointed and would probably not return. They asked for a 2nd chance...which I did do, on Sunday Brunch Buffet. It was amazing! Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared and I promised the management team that I would share this online. 

We ate till way past full, because all was sooo good, I tried most items on the buffet (cuz I paid for it!)  They really took to heart all  our service suggestions. Glad I went back, as they redeemed themselves.

What's worth a try? Mac and cheese, chicken, waffles, collard greens, any desert, grits, sliced turkey, potato hash, catfish nuggets,omlette station (our waitperson actually said I did not have to get up...he'd take my order and bring it back to me....yay!). The only dish I did not care for was the Red Beans and Rice....the sauce was thin and lacked flavor profiles (salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, etc).

I just heard the prices went up, from abt. $20 bucks to $25.....hummm ..is this the price for standard service?"}
{"text":"So glad to have Phil the Fire back in town. We discovered chicken and waffles way back in the Shaker Square days and have tried it other places (Deagan's, Southside) and nothing tops Phil's!

It's an odd locale in Woodmere, attached to a Fairfield Inn and in the company of Red Lobster and that Bahama place but a nice space (really big) with good service, at 2 on a Monday anyway. 

Chicken and waffles is just one of those things that sounds like you can go through life without experiencing. Trust me, you are wrong if that's what you think."}
{"text":"Love the food. They just need to have greeter handle only incoming customers and to never leave the door.  Too much confusion and waiting with her having too many task. People get frustrated and leave."}
{"text":"Reviewers on Yelp seem to love Phil the Fire.  Reviewers on tripadvisor don't appear to be so convinced of this place's worthiness.  So, for what it's worth, here are my $0.02.

I was staying at the adjacent Fairfield Inn & Suites and did not have a rental car at my disposal, so my only dining options were Phil the Fire or heading across the street to either Bob Evans or Red Lobster.  The reviews on Yelp pushed me towards Phil.  That said, I'm really glad I went.  

Like others have said, the biggest downfall here is that the service is really slow.  However, I'm judging that as a native New Yorker who appreciates things at a quicker pace.  Despite the speed of service, they are very friendly.

Once the food arrived, I was really blown away.  This was probably the best fried chicken I've ever had and this also marked my first experience with the whole 'Chicken & Waffles' thing.  Not sure I'm a soul food convert just yet but it sure was tasty.

Post meal, I opted for the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Definitely not bad, but probably just a better idea to fill up on your tasty entree.

The other surprising thing about this place was how pricey it was.  At $30 (including tax and tip) for my salad, chicken & waffles entree and cheesecake dessert it wasn't exactly breaking the bank...it was just more expensive than other dining in Cleveland.  

Bottom line: Food was delicious, ambiance nice.  Worth a trip - judge for yourself."}
{"text":"We were in on a Thursday at 6. All 3 of us ordered coffee, it was good but we never got another cup, despite multiple requests. The place was mostly empty, there were less than 5 tables. Our waiter was courteous and friendly but we rarely saw him. We ordered fried green tomatoes, a fave of mine and I've never had a bad one til these. Well not bad just blah, the sauce was good tho.  My sister ordered the chicken and thought it was good but then she got a nice side salad too.  It had a nice mix of greens, cukes, cherry tomatoes, croutons. She was satisfied with the food but outraged by the service which just wasn't there. I ordered the meat loaf and mashed potatoes and a side salad. Oops! We ran out of potatoes. Seriously at 6 on Thursday?  So I had the sweet mashed which were good but a little too sweet. The meat loaf was OK, kinda dry, not very spiced. . I had ordered a side salad that came with no dressing. Remember my sister's? Well this was nothing like that. It was spinach leaves, period. I had ordered balsamic vinaigrette but spent the meal asking people to bring some. 
At the end of the meal our waiter finally showed up and told me they don't serve balsamic what else would I like? Uh... just the check please. So what is wrong here? Disorganized?,not enough staff? Poor supply ordering? I think all of the above. I won't go back unless i see 'New Management\" sign which is a shame but there are other really good places with southern, cajun, soul, Nawlins type food around the area."}
{"text":"I went for the Sunday Buffet. You have a choice between breakfast food or soul food. The food was not too expensive for a family of four. The food is excellent and the staff is superb. I plan to go as often as I can."}
{"text":"Good to have Phil back into the Cleveland mix and with style! Maybe I hyped its return a little too much in my mind.  Not sure, but I will be back again. I cheered when Phil moved to the city... I cried when Phil left Shaker... and yes... I cried when they closed the city location, thus leaving me void of premium catfish, waffels and fried chicken. The day I learned that he was opening back up, was a very joyous day.  

Maybe my taste buds changed in the few years that his establishment has been closed, but the food alone (in his new location) did not inspire me like it once did.  Phil the Fire is \"a-ok\" and hopefully I will be more impressed the next time I go. I loved the Mac and cheese and the collared greens, but the following is where I get a little sad: Their catfish sandwich was a tad undercooked and under seasoned. For the longest time I had worshiped this sandwich like few others and now I am at odds with my feelings. I will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and had to try to the chicken & waffles. I got the boneless fried chicken option, the chicken was yummy but did not care for the waffle. I had to get extra syrup b/c my waffle sucked it. The waffle had the cinammon-spiced flavor and a cinammon butter to use too. Not to crazy about that. The meal came with hot sauce & syrup.  My friend went with the catfish sandwich and fries. There was tons of  hand cut fries and the catfish was jumping off the roll (plenty of fish). We did have to ask for more tartar sauce. The portions are big and the sauce comes small FYI. We also decided to try the german chocolate cake. It was a big portion and it was just A-Ok too."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday to use my Groupon.  Overall good experience, and I would be willing to go back.

When we arrived, we stood at the check-in desk for probably 5-10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us.  It seemed rather chaotic and unorganized.  However, once we were seated we had good service, so it wasn't a big deal.  The restaurant is suprisingly large with many rooms, so it looks like it would be good for groups.  

We made it just in time for happy hour (ends at 7pm M-F), which features discounted drinks and half price appetizers.  We had the catfish nugget appetizer, an ODB (dirty martini w blue cheese olives), and a sweet lemonade (lemonade w vodka).  The cocktails were excellent, and the appetizer was good.

Since none of us had been here before, we wanted to try a variety of things on the menu.  We got an order of the famous chicken and waffles, a meatloaf dinner with the special cornbread muffin, cheesy grits, and mashed potatoes, and a side-dish sampler entree with mac and cheese, collards, and jumpin' john (black eyed peas with red beans and rice).  The cornbread muffin was excellent, sweet and dense.  The portions are all very large (for the record, the side dishes that come with the sampler are the same size as those that come with any other entree).  Everything was good.  The jumpin' john was my favorite of all the sides we tried - just the right amount of heat.  The desserts looked really good, but we were too full to try anything.

The only negative things to say about the food:  the collards were a little bit too salty for my taste, and the mac and cheese was a little bit greasy.  The meatloaf was just ok.  Overall the meal was delicious.

The biggest negative, and the reason I took off a star, was the price.  The drinks were good, but I wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for them.  My side-dish dinner was $15 and didn't even come with cornbread.  The side dishes range from $5-7, which is too much in my opinion.  The meatloaf dinner was a better value for $15 (comes with 2 sides and cornbread).  An extra cornbread muffin for $2 is worth it though."}
{"text":"Wow, do I have a story to tell. The basic points first, though:
1. Yes, the food service was a little off. Though that could have been circumstantial. Our server seemed frantic and concerned with too many other things. I felt a bit rushed in the end. Read ahead for the potential reason he was so wild. 
2. The restaurant was clean and the interior was welcoming.
3. The food was fantastic. Though I've had better grits, I really liked what I got (they were buttered, but not enough ;) ). The mac and cheese was delightful and the fried green tomatoes were so tasty. The chicken and waffles was superb. The cinnamoney deliciousness of the waffles paired with the perfect crispness of the chicken was great!! 

Now for the entertaining part!! Yaay!

We went on the last night of Groupon deal, so naturally, everyone else did too. When we got there, we felt pretty good about the wait, since we were about 40 minutes early for our reservation. Not a problem. The hostess promised we would be seated as soon as possible, though it wasn't looking like we'd be seated before our reservation time. It was a beautiful crisp evening; not too hot, not too cold. Nice. 

We went back inside nearer to the reservation time, starting to get pretty hungry. We suddenly noticed that the crowd was getting a little anxious and they obviously hadn't seated more than one or two diners since we got there. Suddenly, a woman comes in from outside. Stout, shorter than me, and irate. She immediately starts whining, \"Why can't we sit down?! We've been here forever! You're making us suffer outside in the fresh air! Oh gosh, how will I survive this night?!\" 

Ok, ok, I used some generous hyperbole, but you get the picture. The hostess calmly tells the woman that they're having some troubles in the kitchen and can't seat anyone until they're all cleared up. If they can't serve them all menu items, they're not going to seat people and turn them down from their menu selections. It made sense to me and my boyfriend. But apparently we were the only ones that understood what was happening despite multiple iterations. This woman demands her Groupon (money she hasn't really spent yet) be extended because she can't endure any more of this. The manager comes out and extends the Groupons, but people still don't seem to understand that they're not seating for a legitimate reason. Instead, the furious crowd seems to think that this is a personal attack on them and they're just being downright mean here. 

Here's where it gets good, Yelpers. As the crowd bum-rushed the hostess kiosk for their extensions, one woman stands on her tippy-toes and starts screaming, \"The food is good, but not THAT good. The service here SUCKS. I WILL NOT BE BACK HERE AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER. **WRITE YOUR REVIEWS, PEOPLE, WRITE YOUR REVIEWS!!**\" And she proceeds to push people out of her way and leave the restaurant. Personally, I am SO. RELIEVED. that I didn't find anyone on here reviewing Phil based on a Groupon catastrophe that couldn't have been avoided. The whole debacle was poor taste on all of those customers' parts, especially that \"reviewer\" woman. I was disgusted by the lack of manners and decency the public showed.

On the other hand, the hostesses were so completely fantastic here. They handled the situation with a much more calm, warm demeanor than I could ever hope to have done. Much applause. 

We waited it out and only ended up waiting about an hour or so past our reservation time. It seriously wasn't as bad as everyone was making it seem. The food was good and I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"I read the great reviews for Phil the Fire but after a recent visit there I was greatly disappointed. The service was extremely slow. We ordered chicken and waffles...the waffles were cold and the chicken taste better at KFC. We sent the waffles back but they came out cold the second time. If they are gonna boast good soul food, the chef needs to take a few lessons from my mother.  The mac and cheese was cold and looked as if it had been sitting all day. As a side note, the desserts are definitely NOT from scratch. I was very disappointed and do not plan to return. Way overpriced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Gave this a try since there were quite a few positive reviews based on the shaker location a few years ago.  I should state that i am from texas and am a tough grader on anything \"southern.\". 

The bar atmosphere is great.  Warm color scheme and plenty of space and plenty of flat screens.  Background music about the right volume and music selections fit the bar.  Service was very good with one minor exception (later).

I ordered the catfish.  1 filet is $14.  2 is $23.  I asked the bartendef if the filets were a pretty good size. \"Sure\"..... Ordered the single filet option.  Pretty meager size as it turned out.  Quickly asked for the upgrade to a second filet which was handled cheerfully.  The catfish was prepared perfectly (not much to fried fish anyway).  Batter coating was not too heavy.  I expected a bit more \"kick\" but it was a ok.  The tartar sauce container would have held 1 ounce if it was filled to the top which it wasn't.  Went thru 2 easily.  The sides were \"fresh\" and the cole slaw was probably the best i have had.  The \"sgnature\" corn muffin had been hanging around the kitchen for several hours before it hiy thr plate.  It was big and heavy but not appetizing.  

The only service issue was the busboy who picked the very moment i took a bite to stsrt clearing my side dishes, unused utensils, napkins etc.  I mean everything except my plate and the fork in my hand.....\"hey, give me back my teaspoon of tartar sauce!\"

The bill for the 2 filet dinner and 1 beer was $31 including tax.  Seems a bit high for the meal served but i will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Food is very good, and the service awesome.  They will make the food the way you want it.

Can get kind of slow at times."}
{"text":"Very good chicken on a fluffy waffle with syrup ... Frankly delicious plus they have single malt scotch.  Simple, straight forward Southern cooking ... Very tasty!
Plus service is friendly and prompt.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I went Sun 09/04/11. The service for Sunday was buffet style. The chicken was especially thick and good. The rest of the food was good as well. I was a bit concerned that there was more meat and less fruit and veggies, however Phil The Fire is known for his chicken and waffles. I hope they grow the menu to add more fruit and vegetables in the futures. I think the buffet could be a little better organized."}
{"text":"It was my intention to visit Phil The Fire way before their one year anniversary, so I was really happy to be able to meet up with someone near and dear to me tonight.  I love the warm atmosphere of the restaurant & soul music playing in the background.   The  Blackened Catfish, Greens were prepared to perfection.  Best of all was the POUND CAKE!!! I live in Michigan now, and can't wait to come back home for some Chicken and Waffles! Great service, great food with great company make your restaurant the perfect place for me to hang out in whenever I'm home in Cleveland. GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Phil the Fire.  The food each time was veery good.  The first time we went on a Saturday night and the wait was 45 minutes (with a reservation).  This time we went on a Monday and the overall experience was pretty good.  My husband had the blackened catfish dinner with Mac-n-cheese and fried corn, portions were huge.  I ordered fried shrimp (received sautéed shrimp instead). I ordered collard greens and jumpin john (which consists of red beans and black-eyed peas over rice).  I received hoppin john (just black-eyed peas over rice) instead.  I didn't complain about either mix-up because the food was just that good!  The corn muffins were very tasty.  Our server, Denise, was very friendly, attentive, and professional.  

We will definitely return (on a weekday:-)"}
{"text":"Draft beer was rancid. Service slow . Fried green tomatoes OK. Fried chicken very greasy.  I'm bummed because I love this kind of food and it is hard to find in NEOH. But I don't see me coming back here. Pricey slow service mediocre food.   Don't bother."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why people rave about this place. The food is good but not overwhelming so. The service is decent most times but I have had terrible service on a time or two and management did little to correct this. All in all its just okay but worth a try as there aren't many \"upscale\" soul food restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Started the meal with the catfish nuggets. They are pieces of catfish battered and fried. They were extremely greasy and nearly inedible and I like greasy food.  My main course was 1/4 fried chicken, cheesy grits and collard greens. The chicken was also greasy, only not as bad. After removing the skin (which is normally my favorite part) the chicken was ok. The cheesy grits didn't have much flavor but the greens were awesome. I should have just ordered three sides of greens. 
To top everything off service was absolutely horrible, and the place was not busy what so ever.
I did meet Phil on my way out, which was cool. Had he visited me while I was eating I would have told him my issues.  I would go back for the greens, but a man cannot live on greens alone so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Been waiting to see what the buzz about Phil The Fire was all about. Then Groupon offered a deal, so it was a perfect opportunity. Went there with the wife and kids. Disappointed to find that they didn't have a kids menu (or at least one wasn't shown or mentioned to us). It is a more upscale setting in what used to be Houlihan's connected to the old Holiday Inn. I've always been used to comfort/soul food as take out or served by a very small restaurant, so this was interesting to me off the bat. We went on Mardi Gras and they had awesome live music by jazz band Horns & Things. Overall, we very much enjoyed our food and our visit. The kids each had a waffle with the chicken breast baked right it (called the J something). My wife and I decided to get one of their shared entrees. A plate full of fried chicken breast slices and large fried shrimp was $45. It had about 8 pieces of the sliced chicken breast and maybe about 15 shrimp, served over what seemed to be deep fried spinach. It was good! But for $45? I wouldn't get it again. In hindsight, we should've gotten the chicken and waffles, but we wanted to be a bit adventurous. We also got dessert - a sweet potato pecan pie and a red velvet cake. Both were okay, but too sweet. didn't seem special enough to be considered \"upscale.\"

The service? It was okay. Our server was friendly enough, but he made us feel rushed the entire evening. When he first came to our table to take our drink orders, I also ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer (they were good). He said we should place the rest of our order at the same time because they were busy, so we had to make a decision on our entrees quickly. Then when it came to ordering dessert, he made the assumption and said \"you want that to go?\". We got the idea and just said \"sure, we'll take it to go.\"

So I'm deducting stars for my perceived value of what we ordered at this visit, then the so so service. But we'll come back again to try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to get chicken & waffles here for her birthday.  We had a reservation (Saturday evening, seemed like a good idea).  Waited about 10 minutes for our table, didn't think it was a big deal.  Sever was nice, drink order arrived quickly, everything seems fine.  Ordered dinner.  Waited.  And waited.  And waited.  After about 20 minutes, our server apologized, brought some mini corn muffins.  About this time, I start really paying attention, and NOTHING is coming out of the kitchen, except for a couple of desserts.  Another 15 minutes, we ask for the Manager.  She says she'll check into it & heads to the kitchen.  After 5 minutes, the family (ok, my parents, it is a family birthday dinner out) are in full revolt, and I do something I haven't done in a long time.  We walk out.
I enjoy the food here, I really do.  But this place's service issues are terminal.  Get your chicken & waffle on somewhere else.

Of course, I worte this on the mobile platform a couple weeks ago, then saw the place was closed in the Plain Dealer today."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING. I'd heard this restaurant talked up for years, and when a Groupon for bunch appeared a few weeks, I took the plunge.

It is in Woodmere, right off I-271 (across from TJMaxx and Whole Foods), very convenient. Plenty of parking. The restaurant itself is a former Houlihans (and I think a former Uno Pizza?); a very attractive, cozy brick interior with fireplaces -- nicer than the exterior (attached to a hotel) would imply.

But we went on an August Sunday and either the service is poor OR the Groupon overwhelmed them (and it is their 2nd one I believe). Service was terrible. We had a 30 minute wait for a table, even though we could see empty tables from the doorway. The problem apparently is not tables, but servers and FOOD. They did not have enough of either!

There are two lines; one is breakfast items (including the famous waffles) and the other is dinner items (the famous chicken). In the bar, is a very small platter of fruit, and tiny samples of dessert in little lucite drawers -- an odd way to serve things.

Good stuff first: there is amazing homemade mac n' cheese -- best I've ever had. And collard greens with hamhocks; delicious! A real treat. The humingbird and red velvet cakes were good. Catfish chunks were OK but there was NO tartar sauce OR lemon for them.

Also blackeyed peas and rice (average). There was a bowl of packaged-type salad greens with some dressing -- really, a waste of space. And they looked \"tired\".

The bad: if you are a chicken and waffles place, the chicken and waffles must be superb. They are just fair here. The chicken -- which they ran out of!!!! -- is just dark meat, drumsticks and half-wings. No white meat. The batter has little seasoning (presumably you are expected to dose in hot sauce). The chicken itself was TOUGH and sinewy. VERY disappointing. The famous waffles? undercooked and pillowy, like white bread. Not crisp AT ALL. The famous cinnamon butter? more like \"cinnamon margarine\" and they restrict you to a tiny dab -- make it seem like a treasure they don't want to give away.

Tiny corn bread muffins and biscuits were tough and bone dry (too much heat lamp). Scrambled eggs: undercooked. Sausage OK. French toast -- some kind of disgusting, dry, overcooked, BLACKENED triangles -- inedible. Also: no maple syrup (hot or cold) for the waffles OR french toast! I don't eat grits so I can't comment on them. They were making \"to order\" omelets but were so far behind, you must order from the table and we got ours as we finished desert -- it was over browned and super-tough. They lacked ham or bacon for them, too. 

This is a somewhat costly brunch at $25 a person, and frankly, there was not that much food, since I think you count on eating CHICKEN and they ran out every few minutes. I filled up on mac and cheese, and collards but is that worth $25? NO.

Service was so atrocious I could not leave a tip. They were badly understaffed, and even though we were early, also ran out of catfish and mac n cheese! A lot of folks standing around hungry and frustrated.

Just a total disappointment, especially at \"upscale prices\"."}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent and the service was great!  The shrimp and chicken skewers were amazing - great flavor.  

I loved the mac and cheese and the red beans and rice.  The pecan sweet potato pie was a first and yet it was a great combination.

I absolutely loved the chicken and waffles.  The cinnamon on the butter was a nice twist.  The syrup was yummy (and I am picky about syrup).  The combo was delicious.  I ate the whole thing.

I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stars: 4-

Pros: 
The thing to get here is clearly the chicken and waffles. That said, I got the \"half chicken with waffles\" option. The portions were huge. 2 big chicken breasts and a wing and a thigh. My friend order the same and received similar (1 breast, 2 thighs, 1 wing).

The chicken was juicy, the skin and breading was thin and crisp. Very well done.

The fried chicken came on a large waffle, which was fluffy and delicious. Came with syrup and hot sauce. 

Sweet potato fries were good. Could be a bit crispier tho.


Cons:
First of all, any southern style comfort food place that serves semi-decent fried chicken as its main course is generally going to have positive reviews. Unless you  1. underfry the breading so it is not crisp, 2. add way too much breading, or 3. overfry the chicken so that it is not tender anymore, it is rather difficult to mess fried chicken up.

The waffle is large, but it is just a plain waffle, something you can get anywhere. Nothing special here.

Fried green tomatoes were alright. Didn't exactly like the taste (a bit bitter), but I think that's generally how they are. 

Pricy for just fried chicken and an ordinary waffle. we didnt order drinks or dessert and it came to be $20 (tip and such included) per person.

The hot sauce tastes exactly like tabasco sauce and again, nothing special.


Bottom line:
It tastes good because its fried chicken and a waffle with maple syrup. hard to expect otherwise. Phil the Fire fits the bill and is just what it is supposed to be.
But if you order KFC and make your own waffle, it tastes just about as good and half the cost. Try it if you dont believe me. Just make sure you add maple syrup and tabasco sauce to your KFC.


NOTE: be sure to try their sunday buffet. It is very pricey (25$ / person) compared to even sushi buffets ive been (we are talking Cleveland here)... but i hear its really good."}
{"text":"18 filtered reviews--13 of which gave one star:  I felt compelled to give Phil the Fire a try.  To start with, I wasn't a fan of the space the restaurant was in--an old Houlihan's (with what seemed minimal interior adjustment) connected to a Fairfield Inn.  The environment seemed to suck away the character of the restaurant and the food--the self-proclaimed comfort food for the soul.

Fortunately, the food proved better than its environs.  The Quarter Chicken (Breast & Wing) Chicken and Waffles was solid.  It wasn't the best fried chicken (a bit drier than I would have liked), nor was it the best waffle, but it remains a pretty satisfying combination.  In retrospect, I wish I had gotten a bigger side of the breakfast syrup to pour over my dish.  I also wish the syrup was served warmer.  I didn't taste \"The Jake\"--two pieces of chicken breast put in a waffle pocket, but it didn't look that appetizing (even topped with a small mound of cinnamon butter)--seemed like a kids food version of the chicken and waffles combination.

The sides were really good:  I loved the Red Beans & Rice (by far and away my favorite thing of the night), and the Fresh Green Beans were a good accompaniment as well.  I wasn't that crazy about the Fried Green Tomatoes appetizer, but they are improved with the remoulade.  The Sweet Tea had a mix of lemonade in it (not sure if this is standard operating procedure there or not)--which is fine if I wanted an Arnold Palmer, but it cannot rightly be called sweet tea.

Unlike some of the opinions in the filtered reviews, I found the service to be rather inviting and friendly.  Our server even let us know that they had only been open about a month and were taking comments very seriously in an effort to improve.  The execution of the service was a little flawed, however:  We actually didn't get our appetizer order until after the entrees and sides came out.  Hopefully that will get better as things smooth out further.

This is a tough restaurant to rate.  I'm not personally in any rush to go back, but I think it's worth a try--at least to give the Chicken and Waffles a go.  Again, it's not amazing, but in its simplicity it rises above the concoction over at The South Side (airline chicken breast) as well as the gourmet gastropub version at Deagan's (Amish chicken with blackberry maple syrup).  I will note that Phil the Fire was a little more expensive than I anticipated:  The Breast & Wing Chicken and Waffles was $17 and the Fried Green Tomato appetizer was $9."}
{"text":"Was not that hungry so I ordered the angus burger.  When it came, it looked and tasted like a turkey burger.   It was also only about a quarter inch thick.  When I am paying $12 for a burger I expect a decent size portion.  Service was OK"}
{"text":"My grandfather and I were given a suggestion to go to this restaurant by the man working at the desk at the Hampton Inn and Suites across the street. We were absolutely one hundred percent pleased, surprised and satisfied. I had the blackened catfish (a personal favorite; it was great, although it could have used just a bit more blackening. But I like things super spicy.) I got macaroni and cheese (homemade and cheesy and perfect) and collared greens (leafy and tender and absolutely glorious) as sides. Grandpa got chicken and waffles. Our server's name was Harold and he was attentive, kind, and knowledgeable. He even stuck around to make sure we knew how to do the chicken and waffles \"right\"! I had a bite and they were absolutely wonderful; the chicken was juicy and not overly breaded and the waffle was fluffy and cinnamony; especially with the hot sauce and maple syrup, they were an absolute treat. We had to have dessert, of course, and chose the peach cobbler. Now, I've had bad peach cobbler. And this was fantastic. It had just enough spices and the crust was flaky and fresh (not soggy at all!). 

The portions were plentiful and every bite was just as good as the last. And for an added surprise, we got to meet the owner, Phil. He was walking around and talking to customers and he was just as nice as could be (and with a great handshake to boot.)

I recommend this place like crazy (which means a lot coming from a Virginia/DC native like me.)"}
{"text":"Eh. Service is slow as others have mentioned, food is okay, but fairly overpriced for what it is.  I've been here twice at this point, and don't see a need to come back.  

I got the chicken and waffles the first time, and the quarter chicken with mac and cheese and corn the second.  The chicken is good- don't get me wrong- but not mind blowing by any sense of the word.  I'll take Hot Sauce Williams any day over this place."}
{"text":"Descent food. Horrible horrible service... This restaurant would live up to the hype and would be amazing if the staff was better. Never even got refills nor our ketchup until the end of our meal.  Took us 20 mins to get our bill and had to wait 20 mins just to get seated with reservations. 20 mins to order. Wth is up with this place.  The atmosphere was nice, but other than that the hype isnt there."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Courtyard Marriott across the street and thought I'd give this place a try. 

Glad I did. We sat at the bar and it was a full house. From what I here, it is always a full house in the bar. They had live soul-full music. Reminded me of the Temptations or something...it was lovely.
It was very loud though, making it almost impossible to carry a conversation, but it was nice distraction from the awkward silence you get when you go out w/ people you dont really know.  

Also, there was a good mix of people in the restaurant. It was a comfortable place to drink & listen to music if you are a loan traveler, or if you are w/ friends its a good place to catch a bite to eat before going out. 

Food:
I ordered the \"Wrappers Delight\", which was a deliciously moist Catfish toritilla wrap w/ awesome bold flavors. I was very impressed with the flavors, giving me a small party in my mouth. 
The only thing was I ordered the Sweet Potato fries and recevied normal french fries. This mess up may have been due to how crowded one the bar area was, with only one server doing everything. It was a good mistake, because the french fries were greasy, but good. They were fried with the potato skins still on the, which gave it some extra flavor/texture. 
Overall I was pleased w/ this restaurant and would definetly go back."}
{"text":"Went there for their very first Sunday brunch.  Left feeling like I wouldn't be able to eat for a week.  On Sundays the only option is the brunch buffet for 19.99.  My dining companion and I only wanted to try the chicken and when we were told yes it is available with brunch we decided to stay.  The chicken was everything fried chicken should be.  Crisp, tender it was delicious.  The collard greens came full of pulled turkey and were my favorite of the whole meal.  They were also the only green thing or even semi-kinda healthy thing on the buffet line.  Unless you count the grits without the cheese in them.  Which there really was no purpose for since the cheese grits right next to them were extremely heavy and there was no promised red-eye gravy to put on the grits.  They were just plain.  Also the turkey bacon tasted like shoe leather.  I would just get rid of it and serve regular bacon.  The fried catfish nuggets were tender but a little over-battered.
I'm actually not a big fan of belgian waffles.  They all taste the same to me and phil's were no different, but the cinnamon butter was a nice added touch.  They only offered one dessert, a red velvet cake that had an amazing frosting but the cake itself was a bit dry.
One of the real standouts was the fresh-squeezed orange juice.  It was five bucks a glass and we were given one refill.
There was a pretty solid crowd and they were on a wait when we left.  I probably wouldn't go back for the brunch.  It was a bit pricey for what you received, but I definitely would go back to try another chicken dinner."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on Sat 9/17/11.  We were there early and only a few tables were occupied.  However, the service was a little lacking. Our server had one large party of 10 ppl and our table of two. She seemed somewhat inexperienced. I was a big fan of Phil from the days on Shaker Sq. and I was thrilled to learn it was coming back. I couldn't wait for the chicken and waffles to return. Of course, that was what I ordered...and I was totally satisfied. It was delicious. The waffle had a great flavor and it was hot when it arrived at the table.  The chicken was crispy, flavorful and delicious!  Next time I'll try something from the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Lots of their Sunday buffet food items overlapped with complimentary hotel breakfast, for example, sausage links, scrambled eggs, soggy French toast,  below average waffle, and all of their dessert items. But this isn't the worst part......the terrible, long, disorganized wait!!! We arrived at 2 pm for our reservation at 2:15 pm. We weren't seated until 3!!! As it turned out, the kitchen has decided to stop serving more food to the buffet area because they were afraid they would be out of food to serve their dinner customers and they told the front manager to stop bringing customers in. However, when they all of the sudden declared it, there were already 30+ people waiting to be seated either with reservation or without for over an hour!!! Total chaos!!! And manager kept on apologizing and dished the disharmony between kitchen staff and waiting staff. It didn't look good at all to the business. I only wish the owner can be notified about this and do something about it. If your buffet is conditional, make it clear for everyone, including your employee!!! Fried chicken and fried catfish nuggets are good. This soul food experience was not good at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Phil the Fire because I was eager to taste the food. Unfortunately, the experience was not good. Everything from the food, the service and management was bad. Needless to say we will never go back."}
{"text":"Phil the Fire in its original home in Shaker Square was an absolutely perfect combination of delicious soul food and a great location. In its current iteration, it seems not much has changed. Yes, Orange Place is not quite as charming as Shaker Square is, but it's a much shorter drive for yours truly, so that always helps.

The food seems to be the same: delicious. The chicken and waffles are the height of sweet and savory harmony, while the macaroni and cheese tastes homemade and fresh. The double butter peach cobbler, which I remember as being one of my favorite desserts, seems to be a little less fresh than it used to be, while the ice cream on top was freezer burnt. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, just not as good as it used to be.

Overall, it appears Phil hasn't lost a step despite the new location and a years-long hiatus. Bravo."}
{"text":"During a first visit to a restaurant like Phil the Fire, I generally follow the guideline of ordering the house specialty.  But I also have a much stupider rule of refusing to order the same thing as my dinner companion, which has led to me eating a lot of subpar food, as my eating pal looks on in amusement.  

Needless to say, I should've stuck to my guns and gotten the chicken and waffles, rather than the catfish variation.  The fried fish and the waffle tasted fine by themselves, but there was not enough salt in the fish to counteract the treacly Belgian underpinning.

We also ordered the fried green tomatoes, but the highlight of that small plate was the creamed corn.  The mashed yams also came recommended, but it was just to potent for my tastes.

Overall, Phil the Fire was a good dining experience, but for the relatively high expense, I'm unlikely to come back. There's just much better soul food out there (and if anyone who knows where in the Cleveland area, please do let me know!)."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles are delicious!! I'd never had it before and this won't be the last time. The waffles are fluffy with cinnamon butter, the chicken is crunchy on the outside, the syrup is sweet and the hot sauce is spicy, but not too spicy. It's perfect! 

I went with the boneless chicken breast and waffles. You get two big chicken breasts, which is more than enough food. My husband had the bone-in breast and wing. He said he might go boneless next time, just to make it easier to eat! 

We also tried the \"Soul Rolls\" appetizer, which has \"collard greens, red beans, cheese, tomatoes and onions rolled in a tortilla.\" I wasn't sure if I'd like the rolls, but they were great. They come with a slightly spicy salsa and sour cream on the side. 

We will definitely be back. Can't wait to try more soul food!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for soul food. The 216 unfortunately doesn't have enough offerings, so when I hear Phil was opening back up, I HAD to go. All I've heard since moving to Cleveland is how good the Shaker location was. 

We arrived as a group of 5, and I started having doubts about the location. Its connected to a hotel, and the lobby smelled of pool chlorine. However, once inside it was warm, cozy, and rather upscale. 

I subtracted one star because our service was SO slow... Our waitress Tanya was super attentive, but she kept complaining to us about how behind the kitchen was... which made us think from the beginning that we needed to settle in for a long night. All in all, we were there for about 2.5 hours.

But, MAN was it worth the wait! I ordered The Fire Cocktail... and as soon as I ordered, the waitress asked me whether I was \"sure\" because it had Absolut Peppar  in it and most people send it back because its \"too spicy\". Umm... YES, I am definitely sure! The sound of sweet and spicy mixed together sounded right up my alley. Then, the bartender personally delivered it to see whether I'd really like it! Maybe their regular customers have a different taste palate, but I was in heaven. Although, I think that she skimped on the Peppar, not to be cheap, but because they thought I'd turn up my nose at the flavor. So - it ended up being more sweet than savory... kind of a disappointment. 

Everyone at the table got chicken and waffles - because what else would you get there?! IT WAS AMAZING! Absolutely amazing. The waffle was fluffy and crisp, the chicken was done perfectly, and the hot sauce was perfect. I got the boneless, but several other people got various bone-in pieces of chicken. Its a preference thing, but everyone had the same opinion: Phil is ON FIRE!

I will definitely go back...again and again.... This is a great addition to the East Side selection."}
{"text":"I never went to the original Phil the Fire, but based on other people's opinions I expected to be amazed.  I wasn't.  For the amount of employees in the restaurant, nobody should have to wait for anything.  There were at least 6 people cooking and an additional 10 people serving/bussing/hosting and talking.  We had to wait 5+ minutes for a table despite there only being about 5 tables occupied out of the 15 or so in the main dining room.  Every table I looked at had a different server.  Our server was very friendly but took a bit of time taking our orders and we got our appetizer before she got our drinks from the bar.  The bussers were extremely eager to clear EVERYTHING off the table, whether you were using it or not.  One took my friends 2nd fork before she had even used it and right after the appetizer!  The catfish nugget appetizer was pretty good, the fish was cooked well.  They didn't have the type of beer my friend wanted and they ran out of boneless chicken breats for my friend's chicken and waffles.  The only alternative was \"The Jake\" which has bits of the boneless chicken breasts in the waffle batter and then cooked.  She said it was kind of weird.  I got the fried leg and thigh with a waffle.  I was told they were out of the cinnamon butter that comes with the waffles, yet there was some on my waffle under the chicken.  When I asked, 4 different people came by to tell me there wasn't anymore cinnamon butter, including one of the cooks who was pulled out of the kitchen by another server.  After about 10 minutes, I was told by our server that somebody had turned on the \"whipping\" machine and there was more butter being made.  It's cinnamon....and butter.  I don't know how hard it was to just make more when it was getting low, but whatever.  The chicken was cooked well and had a great crispiness, but didn't taste like ANYTHING.  Seasoning in not in the vocabulary and I had to dip it in syrup to give it flavor.  The 3-cheese mac and cheese was pretty basic.  It has cheddar, monterey jack, and a 3rd non exciting cheese.   We were also told that they were out of banana pudding when we went to order dessert.  I may have to wait to take another trip there.  They have some kinks to iron out for sure!"}
