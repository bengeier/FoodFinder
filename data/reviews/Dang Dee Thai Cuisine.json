{"text":"This place was great - you just gotta know what you're going in for.  It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall Thai joint, but with that comes some authenticity.  You can feel that the place is run by real Thai people and you're gonna get real Thai food.  The decor of the dining room is slightly indicative of what you might actually find in Thailand.  Not so romantic, but legit.  

Food was tasty, we got Green Curry and Pineapple Fried Rice.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is hard to find, it's the kind cooked with curry powder.  The staff was kind, gentle, and almost shy, but more than happy to attend to any requests.  

It's a nice change of pace, I'll be back here soon - Thumbs UP!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about three years (approx. once every couple of months) and have *just now* attained a yelp acct. for review.

I love coming here. The staff is always really friendly and even starting remembering me after only a couple visits, which is pretty nice. They're also really accommodating. I came here for my graduation dinner in '13 for 8+ people and I called ahead to see if they would stay open one hour later than their initial closing time and they were more than accommodating. 
I usually either order the red curry or the pad thai with tofu and it's amazing every time."}
{"text":"Been a year since dining there; more of an FYI to help other yelp'ers that, like me, like to have online menu access for pre-ordering, carry out/pickup etc. AND yelp restricts their own edit functions from adding any online menus from anything other than traditional branded domains.. Not helpful yelp!? 
Dang Dee Thai's menu is on their Facebook page at:

{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, 
Service was great, nice, professional courteous,
Food was delicious, I love thai curry, and I tried dozens of thai places all around the US, this is one of the best curries I had!
prices are very affordable and they also deliver.
good, simple place, delicious food.
Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"my favorite place for pad see ew, which costs $10.76 with tax. large portion size for me and worth every penny. it's so good. very fast and friendly service. clean atmosphere. spacious yet inviting. you can get a loyalty card to redeem points for free food. closed on sundays."}
{"text":"Food takes way to long. Decorations okay but not the best. Took 30 minutes to get 1 order of Pad Thai out. Server barely noticed us. All in all service was horrible and I would never come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is always friendly. Prices are great and the portions are good. 

I love the yellow tofu curry. I've also ordered half a tray of chicken Pad Thai and took it to work and everyone loved it! 

The sticky rice dessert is really good and their Thai tea is amazing! 

Always look forward to coming here."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went out for our anniversary and we decided to try this little place for the first time. I kind of liked the inside, there were only a few tables and nothing fancy, but welcoming. We were pleasantly surprised by the inexpensive menu (dinner for two was $15.00), we got a really delicious soup to start off, that came with our meal. 

I ordered Rad na, which is my favorite Thai dish, I liked it because the portion was large and the noodles had less of a burned flavor than any other restaurant. My husband had Kung Pao Chicken, his portion was a bit small, but well worth the $6.95. I know we will be back, I am already thinking of having that yummy soup again, which was perfect for a cold winter night."}
{"text":"RIDICULOUS PRICES! tried to charge me $13.00 for pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"a nice surprise - great food, good price."}
{"text":"The rewards card has been discontinued.....and has not slowed me down. 

Some dishes I recommend, :
Singapore Noodle w/ Chicken; 
Panang Curry w/chicken; 
Pad Thai is great. 
The appetizers; fried tofu or the Chicken Satay.  
And you must try the Black sticky Rice dessert."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! I work close by so I stop here to eat once a week.
There $7 lunch specials are always so filling, so far I've tried the curries, the 
orange chicken, the pad thai, the sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken 
noodle special. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very relaxed, large, and very well ventilated
compared to some other restaurants where you can smell all the lingering odors
of the people or the food."}
{"text":"Went to a new Thai place (well new to me), I usually get the basic Thai dishes to try out first, my theory is that if they can't get the basic dishes good then it's not worth the second trip there. We started out with the Shrimp Tom Yum salad, I have to say it was awesome, better then the pork larb salad I usually get. The other 2 dishes we had were the yellow chicken curry and shrimp pad Thai. Those 2 were some of the best I have had in a long time.  This is worth a second trip there."}
{"text":"Coming in I saw a mixed result of reviews. After coming here many times I can't seem to find the negative side of this place. This place has amazing food and service. I've been coming here many times now and they consistently make my food in an efficient manner and usually when they're busy they'll take a little longer, but that's expected for any restaurant. The food is high quality for the price you pay. 

I really love their basil dishes as well as their tom kha. 

They have certainly earned themselves a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Truly excellent home-cookin Thai food.

Nope, it ain't fancy, but the service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious! 

I've been many times now, and have never been disappointed. From Pad Thai, to several different curries, Beautifully flavored Tom Kah soup, and Thai Spicy Basil - it's all good. 

My only criticism is that the fried tofu always seems a bit watery and kinda bland. It would be much better if they pressed some water out of it before frying. Still. Not bad.

The biggest surprise was when I asked for sticky rice with mango -and was disappointed to find that it was out of season. The server suggested instead the black sticky rice with shredded coconut.

I was leery. Black sticky rice?? No mango?
It was fantastic!!! I may just order it as my meal next time.

Great prices. Great service. Great food. 
I'll be back again (and again)!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since they opened I just absolutely love the red curry chicken dish is has this taste that just make your taste buds long for more. They also have a great wonton soup. Keep up the great food and the nice smiles."}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to take me out to dinner to celebrate the end of a long week at work for both of us.  I decided on Thai food and this spot was super close to home and didnt have any bad reviews, so it seemed like it would be worth a try.  When you come in the smell of the bread from Subway is definitely notable, but I got used to it pretty quickly.  The place looks neat and clean, not an ideal room for sit down dining but they make it work.  I was kind of worried that the food would be terribly bland and generic but in the end was satisfied.  The waitress was friendly and the food was better than I had expected.  My gf isnt an adventurous sort, so she had chicken pad thai and she liked that.  I got the Dang Dee Salad, chopped iceberg with mint and cilantro and I'm pretty sure it had ground chicken, calamari, and some shrimp that had a kind of ceviche thing going on.  I was pretty impressed with how good it was for costing under $9, even if a part of me worries any time I get seafood at a lower price than I expect.  

So yeah, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month and both times it was delicious. I got the Pad Thai and an order of spring rolls to split with my husband and we were both very impressed. Both times I ordered carry-out and the girls who took my order were super friendly and the food came out quick. My 1 year old didn't mind the short wait for the food either, there was a fascinating fish tank to occupy him while we waited! This place is also right around the corner from where I live, so very accessible to me. Fast, friendly, delicious, convenient and kid-friendly I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Tom yum soup with shrimp is amazing! No heat added is perfect! Pad see ew with beef is great, I love those fat noodles and there's real veggies. Pad Thai is also great. I haven't tried anything I didn't like from here. They are very nice and explain things to you. Great food great service! Try it!"}
{"text":"I got the pad thai with chicken for lunch and it came with about 5 pieces of chicken. The food was good but not fantastic."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to eat.  Nice and quiet, friendly service and delicious food.  I was ecstatic they had my Singapore noodles!  Especially liked the Thai basil in the dishes."}
{"text":"We have become regulars at Dang Dee.  Reasonable prices, friendly service - they quickly learned what we tend to order and remember every time we visit!  Great food!  Dang Dee easily satisfies our Thai food cravings!"}
{"text":"Food is Amazing. Most Authentic Thai food in comparison to all the Thai restaurants I have ever had. Beef was exceptional. Perfectly cooked . Waiters are very sweet as well. Can't get enough of this place. Food tastes the closest to actual food from Thailand . Hole in the wall type of place , not elegant at all but food is good"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here and I can truthfully say...this place is a gem. It's not so big, but their food quality is fairly yums to me. 

Ordered the Mongolian beef (I suppose this isn't very Thai-ly of me), the chow mein, and the yellow curry (super yummy!!). The service was actually good, we didn't feel rushed, nor did we feel like being hovered over. 

Food came out quickly, and was delicious. I love how the spicy ness is just right. Quality, it was authentic. I didn't feel like it was made by just anyone. Can't wait to come back! It's close to me, and I love how it's not so big. Definitely a hidden gem in my books!"}
{"text":"What a gem! We came here by chance and discovered a treasure we hope to come back to."}
{"text":"This place was way better than expected. Staff is friendly. Had the chicken pad Thai and my wife had the shrimp pad Thai, and we both shared a wonton soup. Food was amazing. Will definitely be returning and recommending."}
{"text":"Boring lunch specials and I was not impressed with their Pad See ew its so close to my work but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and how I have not reviewed this place yet is beyond me. The staff is always courteous, the prices are affordable, the portions reasonable, and the food just darn-right delicious!

My most recent meal here I had the Lemongrass chicken. Was a great dish that I wholeheartedly recommend, the flavors were well balanced and the chicken was cooked just right. I can also similarly recommend their Pad Thai and Seafood Combo Soup (I think that's what is called), all are exceptional dishes I have had at this restaurant and I imagine there are many more. I hope they continue to be a great place to visit for years to come!"}
{"text":"Shout out to C F. for mentioning this spot in a Talk thread.  A friend and I went today, and it wasn't bad at all!  We ordered the green curry with beef ($7.95), and the pad see \"lew\" with chicken ($6.95).  I also indulged in a Thai iced tea ($2.00), which was a nice balance of sweetness and creaminess.  

While not the best I have had, I really liked the green curry.  At a spice level of 4/5, and with a little bit of added chili powder, it had a nice strong flavor with no sweetness.  I wouldn't say that the character of curry itself was all that unique or interesting, but it was a nice, liquidy strong one.  With the added ingredients of zucchini and egg plant (which was very yummy), and very tender beef, I found myself going back for seconds!

The pad see lew (like ew?) wasn't my favorite, but it was still good.  It was a bit sweeter and saucier (perhaps too much teriyaki) than I prefer.  It had sliced carrots, American and Chinese broccoli, cabbage, and even a single piece of bok choy  I wished there was more bok choy though.  All of the meat and veggies were fresh and nicely prepared.  Although definitely edible, I prefer a drier version of this dish, so I wouldn't order this one again.  

I can safely give this spot a 3 star review, but it may be better than that.  The lunch menu is pretty small, so we ordered off of the dinner menu.  It was a pretty simple, standard Thai menu, nothing that was really stood out from other places that I noticed.  The prices were just right; pretty much everything was in the $7-10 range for dinner entrees."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is now my best kept secret for great Thai food. Don't be fooled by the outside, once inside it has a warm feeling and very clean. The tastes of the foods which we ordered quite a few were amazing. Especially the attention to detail. \"A must try for Thai\"."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials !! Friendly, quick service. Kind of a dive but very clean. Yellow curry, medium spice was super. Food was fresh & portions were fine.

Good stuff..."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Stick to their Thai options (as opposed to Chinese) and you won't be disappointed. Try the shrimp fried rice, yummy."}
{"text":"We loved the pineapple fried rice! The pad kee mow was too sweet and I wouldn't order that again. Also tried the mango sticky rice which was really good but not sure if it was worth $7 in a casual place like this! Service was good."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for several years. This is the food we remember/enjoy when we travel to Chiang Mai, our favorite destination in Thailand. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic thai food! Ive been to all the thai restaurants in area and vy far tastes the best! Try their rad na..absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place!!! Great food and service!  The prices were reasonable and you get to pic the level of spice you want.  Also, the service is pretty quick but the quality is still good."}
{"text":"Can't beat the prices. I only wished these places used real white meat chicken breast. For under $7 I got a side salad and a full meal, and I left feeling satisfied. My friends got the garlic chicken and they felt a little skimped on their plates. Their portions were definitely smaller. I got the chicken chow mein and it was pretty delish."}
{"text":"Green Curry and Pad Thai, Green Curry and Pad Thai, Green Curry and Pad Thai. 

I don't like anything else. Especially dislike the Tom Yum and Tom Kha. 

Bonus: Last time I dined in they gave me ice cold watermelon slices because they are cool like that. 

Just remember Green Curry and Pad Thai........."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to be able to say \"Daaang Dee!\" after my meal, but instead it was more like, \"You're okay, Dee. Real talk -- you're not my favorite Thai joint in town, but you're an upstanding small business and I respect your hustle, so keep doing you even though I probably will have my lunch elsewhere.\" Relax, that all went down in my head not real life. 

My bf and I were seated immediately in a booth, but weren't approached until about ten minutes later. There seemed to be only one server in the house juggling four tables, also doubling as the one handling phone orders. Poor girl. So yes, lunch service was rather slow. 

If you can't read good, you're in luck for once -- picture menus! This is also convenient for Thai food newbies, visual learners, and maybe babies. All lunch specials are $6.95 and include soup. The soup we got didn't look very appealing, drab in color, and at first glance seemed like it lacked ingredients. I didn't post the picture because it was ugly. I still don't know what it was lol. 

My pad thai with tofu was generous and made with skinnier noodles than what I'm used to, but that was fine. It tasted a little sweeter than anticipated, but still good. My bf got his usual chicken yellow curry at a 1 out of 5 spicy scale, but it tasted bland and watered down. Lesson: get at least a 2 or skip the yellow curry altogether. Order their Thai tea, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Def my fav thai in henderson! Had the tom kah soup today and it was awesome! They made it spicy enough but not deadly. The flavors were just significantly better than most thai places I've been. My whole house agreed"}
{"text":"Very good second time this week. Food is excellent,  fast and friendly service. Good portions, good prices. Very clean place, I eat Thai food all the time this is one of my favorite places now. Be sure to check it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place is quiet and super clean and very nice server . Food was delicious and very reasonable prices compared to the food on the strip!! I will come again!"}
{"text":"The decor is ok, nothing to brag about. It's clean, and the service is great, I have never seen it crowded. The food is top notch, for the variety that they serve. All of the curry's and pad thai dishes are served to perfection, and the quantities are also good."}
{"text":"Super authentic Thai food! I love the service and food every time I go. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice, quiet and authentic place to eat. Far away from the rush and wild atmosphere of china town. I'd say this is the next best thing to Bangkok Thailand. The best place to eat in Las Vegas for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Best red curry, crispy tofu and coconut ice cream in town! Our family has been a loyal customer of this place for several years. We've brought friends here for all occasions and they become regulars. Family owned and operated, the customer service is excellent and the food is superb."}
{"text":"Very rude service, I genuinely felt I that wasn't wanted here.

The waitress barely said more than 7 words to me, \"Know what you want?\" and \"Take a seat.\"

The food was okay. I got the lunch special; the waitress dropped a bowl of soup on my table without saying what it was. No spoon. No refills.

Too many better places to go in this area to waste a visit here, especially with the award winning Carlito's Burritos across the street.

Oh, and I got food poisoning too."}
{"text":"So I came here to get lunch portions for my friends who loves Pad thai
The lunch portion is small
I ordered 2 pad thais, 1 singapore noodles and 1 pad see ew. I am not really impressed with the Pad Thais but I like Pad sew. 4 orders cost 23$ total. 
When I walked in , the place was dead quiet, but after talking to the waitress, she said the restaurant has been opening for 8 months, 
Overall, The taste was not bad for such a cheap price."}
{"text":"I became a regular here because of their amazing orange chicken! The best Orange Chicken I have ever had in my life. I have since then tried several other plates and have always been pleased. There is a chicken soup I am obsessed with, not sure what its called but, I will be a forever customer!"}
{"text":"Yellow curry and Pad thai is my all time favorite and you cant beat their lunch specials. and the girls in there are always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is at least a 3.5 and I will try it again and hope / look forward to raising the review stars to 4....  Worthy place to check out.

1.  Service - If you come at lunch, there are plenty of business lunch people coming here, so it is very crowded. In addition, it seems that really there is one main server with others helping a bit, so it can get busy. Nice, friendly, economical.

2.  Food - The price here are extremely reasonable, which is probably why there are so many people coming here. Many of the entree are 5.95 - 8.95 and it is basically full meal on one plate.  Spice levels are very reasonable, so if you like it with a kick, order up a notch or two on the spice level, as the food is not too spicy.

I ordered Massaman Curry, one of my favorite.  Now, normally, I am aware that Massaman curry is traditionally served with beef, however, the waitress asked if I wanted chicken and I said yeah sure.  The chicken was cube cut and a bit thick as well as a bit tough. I find if it is sliced thin and against the grain, it makes for a much better texture and flavor, rather than cube cut.  Not too sure if many asian style restaurants cut in cube style anyway..... 

My fried ordered the Spicy Eggplant with pork and she liked it.

All orders come with soup, some kind of basic Tom Yum style soup. 

3.  To try - I always compare restaurants with either the Spicy Eggplant with ground beef, or the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle)   So I plan to come back for this.

The place is very, very casual, family oriented, and overall pleasant.  

GK says check it out."}
{"text":"The food is great but do not get delivery! They say 15 minutes but it takes over an hour and then the food is cold. Definitely not worth it! But pickup is always fast just make sure you check your order before leaving because sometimes items are forgotten!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both eat here quite often since he works nearby. The food is always good and the service is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here randomly on a weekday for lunch.

This place is pretty small and has the feel of a hole-in-the-wall. I got the lunch special Pad See Ew, which also came with a clear broth. Both had great flavor and the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"great food friendly staff pad kee mao how was amazing"}
{"text":"The walls are lined with airline and Thailand posters. Other than that, the decorations are almost nonexistent. 

Came here for lunch on a Sunday. The staff were all sitting at a booth when my party of four came walking through the door. The place is dead quiet and a bit unnerving, because how busy a restaurant is usually indicates how delicious the food is. It is a good thing that I went against this initial theory because Dang Dee is fantastic for the price. Their lunch specials run around five to six dollars for an entree with choice of chicken, beef, or tofu. If you want shrimp, add two dollars.

We decided to dine family style and ordered the red chicken curry, spicy basil beef, spicy tofu eggplant, and chicken pad thai. All of our food was ordered at a spicy level of four out of five. When the food came, it looked and smelled amazing. When we tasted it, it was flavorful and just was wonderful on the palate. The red curry is filled with bamboo shoots, zucchini, tofu, and chunks of white meat chicken in a robust coconut base. The beautiful pieces of eggplants were a vibrant purple, soaked up the garlic well, and was complimented by the soft tofu. Two people in our party do not like tofu and still enjoyed this dish. The pad thai was delicious, but pretty standard. The basil beef possessed a delicate smell and was just as flavorful. The only problem with any of these dishes were that they are not spicy at all. I am not sure if they were holding back because we were a primarily Caucasian party, but it seriously tasted like a one. After doctoring up the dishes with the tiny pickled green chilies, it was more like what we had expected. We ended our dining experience with the mango and sticky rice. The glutenous rice with sesame seeds was soft and soaked up all the delicious coconut milk. The mangoes were rip and sweet. It was a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. For $4.50, it was worth every penny.

The aromatics, flavor, and portions are all spot on. The only thing they need to work on is presenting a dish that meets the spice level that Thai food should possess."}
{"text":"The lady working this evening was exceptionally friendly. A very warm greeting, big smile and very pleasant throughout.

The yellow curry with beef was outstanding! The pad kee mow had great flavor but was a little on the hot side for \"medium spicy.\" The tom kha soup was very good as well.

The only mistake was leaving out the white rice to go with the curry. I'd ordered brown rice as a side and she may have misunderstood thinking I wanted it for the curry so not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.

All in all we were very happy and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an impromptu lunch the other day and was very pleased. I got the Pad see Ew and cucumber salad. I got home and dilly dallied, still hot when I opened the box finally!! Everything was fresh, delicious and I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Not bad considering the staff isn't Thai, but there is better food elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"I ordered #4 out of #5 spicy and my mouth was burning for the entire dinner. Be careful not to order #4 unless you like REALLY spicy food!  Everything was fantastic, though!!"}
{"text":"Boo Ya! This place is amazing. The food, (Pad Thai is some of the best I've had!), the staff- So nice and accommodating, all perfect. Cant think of anything that could make this place more awesome. Been here twice now and the first time after our meal, they gave us some super fresh, delicious orange slices, 2nd time I came, they gave us chilled watermelon slices with ice on top. Perfect palate cleansers after the spicy (if you want it that way) Thai food! YUM!

Cant wait to come back again and again. Seriously a staple."}
