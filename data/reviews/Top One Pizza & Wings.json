{"text":"Amazing pizza and HALAL options too! Yes halal pepperoni pizza!! Truly the best I've had in town. Wings are great too. Owners are nice and clean place."}
{"text":"Good pizza and good delivery. Has improved immensely  over the years. My hubby doesn't like the wing. He finds them small and sometimes looking like they come from abused chickens. Subs are ok. Nice people working there."}
{"text":"The crusty was dry and hard and the pizza itself, lacked sauce and the toppings were dried... Won't be going back. Otherwise, the staff was very friendly.."}

Ordered two large pies one topping on each. Came to 20bux picked up. From the pictures you can see that it was made with care. Highly recommend this place. Awesome service and great ingredients."}
