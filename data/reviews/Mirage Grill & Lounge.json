{"text":"Can Yelp please allow me to give 0 stars?

This place is absolutely disgusting. I feel terrible I suggested going here just because I was lazy to go on Hwy 7 to Demetres. 

We ordered the crepe with ice cream. I have NEVER seen crepe so thick and hard. We didn't even eat the crepe and just ate the icecream. The crepe looked like DEAD SKIN. Sorry - it may sound disgusting but imagine eating that.

The steam milk with flavour shot was way too sweet too. Only their cakes were decent. I'll give them that.

Don't go there, unless you want to eat dead skin on a plate."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends to have dessert.  We arrived 5:30 and before being seated for five minutes the waitress came up and told us that there would be a ten dollar sitting fee should we stay after six.  We started looking at the menu and five minutes later the same waitress was back again to ask us if we were ordering anything and to let us know that there was a $10 sitting fee.  Although I know it is important for Mirage to make money but it was totally unnecessary and made us quite uncomfortable.  I had the mocha almond meringue cake ($7) and it was nothing amazing.  Just something shipped to them that they cut.  My friends ordered ice cream and it was nothing special either.  Would not come back for dessert."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of colleagues for a work lunch, and after 90 minutes we still had not received all of our food. The\"all-you-can-eat\" menu advertises pictures of options that aren't actually available as part of the all-you-can-eat deal, and when I commented that this was misleading, I received a lecture from the rude waitress that it's a really good deal so I shouldn't complain."}
{"text":"Don't come to Mirage too hungry because the menu is quite lengthy to get through and you will spend 15 min end-to-end before picking something out.

They are most at home doing Italian fare so order from the pasta and pizza portions of the menu to ensure highest satisfaction.  I give them credit for offering a very generous bowl of hand-made ravioli when some other Italian resto raviolis can't cast a shadow on the dining table (ahem, Terroni).

Nothing wrong with the taste of most of their dishes; and certainly no complaints about serving size.  But I simply feel sometimes that more energy could go into improving the quality of ingredients, such as fresh chicken breast as opposed to frozen and pre-seasoned. 

Oddly enough, the only food item I have seen undersized would be the appetizer bowl of soup.  It also seems to be of soup-mix calibre.  If confronted with the decision, go with the Caesar instead.  

Desserts are delish - go with the Perfect Couple or a Brownie Chill - and make sure you have at least 3 other peeps to share with. 

I will say that Mirage lacks in finesse, it makes up for in a manager who would do anything to make the guest happy.  I have seen it myself - he really wants you to eat well, relax and enjoy the crowd.  There's potential here, if they could survive the Yonge & Eg curse at Lillian's corner."}
{"text":"Mmmm...lunch was over 4 hours ago and I still can't get over how good my wrap was.  I ordered the Mediterranean Wrap with some skepticism: Beans in a non-burrito wrap situation?  Now I see why this was a \"signature dish.\"  The wrap was perfectly grilled and had a nice toasty flavour.  It was totally rich and delicious and not what I was expecting.  My salad was a bit overdressed, but that's my only complaint.  The service was good: Courteous and reasonably quick.  If you've got time for a sit-down lunch I think this place is a great option."}
{"text":"I'm only putting one star here for an important reason: THE RESTAURANT IS CLOSED.

Before it closed, it was an excellent place to dine or have drinks with friends. The atmosphere was friendly and not too loud.  You could actually have conversations without yelling.

The food was not only great-tasting, but presented very well.

Unfortunately, I went to the restaurant last week, and found it closed up with no signs indicating why.  Had to phone around to find out that they've been closed for a couple of weeks.  Their published phone is disconnected too - so this is not a temporary thing.  

It's too bad, and a real shame."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant a few times and thought that the service was terrible, the food was average, and the dessert was okay. Since knowing a former employee, my opinion about this place has worsened. Ill start off with some pros

Pros: 
The decor and atmosphere is pretty nice. Its very relaxing and a nice place to have a drink with a friend. Some of the dessert is good as well but nothing exceptional.

Cons: 
The service on busy nights is terrible. Very very slow. After meeting a former employee I found out that the servers are over worked like horses. The owners do not want to spend any money on labour and the restaurant is very frequently understaffed. The few servers are expected to take care of the entire restaurant, expected to actually go behind the bar and make their own drinks and make their own desserts (because owners do not want to pay a bartender), clean the washrooms in between this, all the while getting yelled at by the owners for not doing this faster. They dont even have time to wash their hands when they make desserts because theres so much to do. Basically they are expected to work like robots. I witnessed a waitress getting some heat from one of the asian managers and she looked like she was going to cry. Service was slow but It was obvious her and the other server in the restaurant were over stressed. The food itself is also pretty poor but I found that the quality has been improving since the management was switched. You can find some tastey things on the menu.

Overall:
I wont be coming here anymore. After experiencing poor service and avg food on more than one occasion, and witnessing and hearing about how terrible they treat their staff, Ill take my business else where."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING.  I ordered a piece of their chocolate explosion cake ($7) to eat with my friend, but only had a few bites from the end and took the rest to go.  When I got it home I realized it was full of GREEN MOLD!!  Like every layer was full of green fuzz.  I am beyond horrified.  How is this place--with their overpriced menu, awful food, cheapy decor, and mediocre service--still in business????

If you have a late-night hankering for good cake, go to Future Bakery on Bloor.  Heck, even something from your local grocery store's pastry section will be better and fresher than anything at Mirage."}
{"text":"I only go for desserts and they are not expressive. Service is generally bad during the day and my review isn't very helpful."}
{"text":"Cafe Mirage has a stunning interior, which provides a lounge-like feeling for guests. This has been a default dessert spot for me for a long time. They serve a wide variety of desserts, and out of the ones I have tried, I have thoroughly enjoyed. The drinks are also really good and decently priced. As for their food, I'm not the biggest fan. It's just very mediocre, and I would not come here just for dinner. 

So if it's late at night and you're looking for a nice place to grab some drinks and dessert, definitely check out Mirage!"}
{"text":"It gives me a feeling that the whole restaurant is almost empty during dinner hours.  We order the Prix Fixe Menu for $30.  The appetizer is Mixed Greens Salad mixed in balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The portion is big and the greens are fresh.  The entr√©e we ordered Grilled Chicken Breast which is tender.  The sauce with sundried tomatoes and spinach is average.  I expect better than that.  The salmon is a bit overcooked.  The Chocolate Explosion Cake though is the best part of the meal.  So I wonder why.

I then see people coming in the restaurants at around 9 to 10 p.m.  No need to say, these people are not coming in for the dinner.  They go for the desserts.  When I look at the table behind us, everyone has a big plate of dessert.  We order the Perfect Couple and the Waffle Cups, Not only the presentation is good but they are delicious.  The portion is huge.  Each costs equal or more than $10.  It is worthwhile to try.  At least for this night.

There is also solo dancer performance at night.  The belly dancer will dance for about half an hour.  She will invite guests to join her. 

We have a very large party later on that requires advance booking.  The coordination is so bad that after more than a week later, we got a reply saying dinner time may not be possible but indeed we want to book for lunch.  This location cannot be confirmed.  I am wondering why.  Is this location going to be moved?"}
{"text":"dirty washroom, unattentive waitstaff, noisy but i love their waffle w icecream. nothing else."}
{"text":"Met a colleague here yesterday afternoon. 

Perhaps I just happened to go at the right time, but I didn't have any of the substandard service I've read about from other Yelpers. 

I was the first to arrive, and since there really wasn't anyone there, I was seated immediately. The server came to take my order, and I got a water while I waited.

The decor seemed a tad cheesy, with the fake Venetian murals and whatnot. But hey - I give them points for trying. 

Our server got my latte order incorrect, but I think that was probably because I didn't specify. The chai latte I ended up getting was ... interesting. I liked the fact they made it with honey. But I could've done with a larger serving. (I blame Starbucks for ruining me for other chais.)

The desserts were okay. I had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, which I found a little bit rich and surprisingly heavy. (This is coming from someone who LIKES her chocolate in any form she can get it.) 

My friend had a slice of the pecan pie, which seemed a bit dense as well. 

(Funny moment of our visit: My friend asked our young server if she could nuke her pie \"for, like, two seconds\" - to which the server replied, \"You mean, like, LITERALLY for two seconds?\" One of her senior associates came to her rescue and handled my friend's request.)

I'd say it's worth a visit to judge for yourself. But having once been a patron of Flavour Dessert Cafe - formerly located on Kennedy Rd. near Progress; it's closed now - I'd rate this place as just okay."}
{"text":"My gf had noticed the place as she works in the area. One Friday we decided to give it a go and see what's happening there. Beautiful decor, immediately seated and prompt service. So far so good...

The food however was incredibly poor. The nachos were terrible (barely any toppings) and the Caesar salad was meh... The cost in the end was relatively high and we left with that feeling that the place has so much more potential if it can make better food than that."}
{"text":"The place looks nice looking but is so dead.. The food is good. The service is bordering at terrible. I have been here multiple times because its so close to where I live and coz there is noone here, its a perfect place for my bf and I to catch up. But man... is their service crappy. You will have to practically dance on the table to get the waitress's attention, which is weird coz there is noone else there! 

This one time, I used a groupon there and they practically lie to your face about how they cant accept groupons unless printed out. We argued for a good ten minutes after which, I was frustrated and wanted to talk to their manager. Suddenly, all was well. They had no problem accepting my groupon. This is specially weird, coz you would think for a customer that visits often, they wouldnt try to play such dirty games. 

NO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Ok...So living at Yonge/Sheppard, I used to go to this place A LOT (even in the days when it was Symposium). The desserts were great (esp. the avocado shake).
A few months back, we get there in the evening, and the place is full, so we stand at the entrance waiting for a table. We look right towards the front kitchen (desserts), and here's what we see:
guy wipes the counter with a rag, then wipes the cake knife with it. Later, wipes the floor too.
Picks up some dessert item with his hands, then wipes his hands on his jeans.
Other staff member stands by waiting for the plates, and doesn't look shocked at all at this (so I guess this is standard/acceptable behavior there)!
And this is the front kitchen . Can you imagine what goes on in the back?!
Needless to say that we are NEVER going back there again."}
{"text":"Went to this fine restaurant/lounge last night, but didn't get around to writing a review until tonight, because the Yelp iPhone app doesn't let you post reviews --  PLEASE FIX THIS YELP :)

Fourth time out to this great place -- if you're looking for a place to just chill and hang for a few hours with friends, this is it. The wait staff aren't rushed, or hurried, and don't pressure you to keep buying things, nor do they want you in and out like other places.

Warm, soft lighting, big comfy chairs, soft cozy booths -- really a great atmosphere for a lounge.

Most appear to get desert or appetizers, which is probably why their food is so good, because it really is prepared fresh.

Long list of unique hot and cold drinks, deserts and appetizers.

But their meals are great too.

Last night, I had the Bruschetta Pizza, which had diced tomatoes, red onions, and lots and lots of feta cheese. I love feta cheese, so I loved this pizza.

My girlfriend got a pesto chicken pasta, with hand-stuffed pasta. I tried it and it was really good too. Hers came with a side Caesar salad, which I've had before, and is also very good.

I wanted to try their seven layer chocolate cake, but the girlfriend wanted something less sweet, and we got one of their other cakes, which was fantastic. Don't remember what it was called, but it had a almond mouse filling, cruchy cake centre, and chocolate icing.

We sat there all night, taking our time -- no rush -- great place to just chill.

Make sure you ask for Alina if you go, she's the best waitress they have. Although all the staff are friendly, she's always there for her customers. Some of the other staff take forever to get to you, and you may end up having quite a wait before even placing an order, but never with Alina :)"}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience. Nothing like the cafe Mirage in the Kennedy Commoins (401 and Kennedy) or the cafe Mirage in Vaughn (hwy 7 and famous players drive, across from the Famous Players Colossus).

Although it has a trendy design and comfortable  ambience, this cafe Mirage seeks to be an upscale eatery, which it falls to do. 

Although the setting is nice, the actual food and drinks, coupled with the prices, are subpar.

Shared a few rounds of beer with my friends. No real special beers to be offered here, and saying the price is above average would be an understatement. Expensive beers would only be tolerate at the Bier Markt downtown, and at least those beers are special and unique.

The coffee is terrible, possibly even worst than terrible, but I'd rather not waste the energy to think of another word, since the watered down coffee was unable to supply me with any caffine what so ever. For a cafe, you'd think that coffee would be the most essential aspect of the resturants repetoire.

The food we ordered were finger foods, hoping to have a delicious snack with our drinks. First the chicken wings, but more likely described as Chick wings, as they were tiny. tiny tiny tiny. The flavour was nothing special, and for the price, a complete rip off. We also ordered sweet potato fries, which too, was a tiny order for a heafty price. 

We dared not stay for dessert.

If you were thinking of going to this establishment, don't. You're better off going to the beer store or LCBO, picking up a six-pack, get some frozen wings and snacks, and enjoy it at home. The beer will cost less, the food would taste better, and you would have saved yourself from a terribly disappointing night."}
{"text":"Good customer services. Manager is so friendly, helpful, and smiley. I love their desserts, but i do not recommand for going for luch or dinner. Main courses are not tasty. But the desserts are highly recommanded. I even liked th fact it stays open till late hours ."}
{"text":"I'm trying to think of things that distinguishes this place from the Boston Pizza next door, and only one thing comes to mind.
'No carpet on the walls'

Another wobbly table restaurant I managed to find. All the decor were black, brown, and dreadful. I think its trying to emulate a gentleman's social club ambiance. The key word here is 'trying.'
I think I ordered the something with fries, not that i care to remember. The place was shabby. In fact, I was so disengaged with the restaurant, when the waitress came to drizzle my wine glass for tasting, it took me a moment to realize what she was doing. The idea of tasting your wine before serving it in an establishment like this skipped me completely. 
I don't know what kind of people come here for coffee, hard whiskey would be more appropriate. Which is available at the bar, tended by a ghastly Woman with neon coloured hair.

My best friend wasn't feeling it either, and so naturally she wasn't in the mood for wine..which meant I had to down an entire bottle of Bordeaux on my own. Given the situation, it wasn't that difficult.

This is not a place for young people, at all. 
The only reason I could see myself in here again, is to dump my fictitious girlfriend. Seems appropriate."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there. You'd think it would be easy to make a good breakfast, but Mirage didn't get the memo.

Eggs were ok, but the bacon was barely cooked, the potatoes were super-bland, and the toast was terrible. Yes, it's possible to make terrible toast. Bread was dry and barely buttered.

Atmosphere non-existant.

{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, the place was very busy. Took the server 10 minutes to come to our table and then took an additional 20 minutes to get our drinks.

I had a brownie sundae with hardly any brownies.  Also, I have never seen a restaurant where the servers cannot pour the coffee and have to wait for the bartender to give it to them.

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Like many other reviews, I am too on the border of giving this place between a two star and a three star. Because this place is near my work, I don't think of this place anything other than a work-lunch place (if I have time).

I have been here for dessert after a late night movie, and for that, it's not bad. Service has always been pleasant so no quams there. Unfortunately, I too have also had a bad cake experience where there was green mold on my piece. Management told me that the cake they gave me was a display piece and quickly gave me a new piece and comped me for it. I'm not sure what to think of it other than if you do order cake, just take a quick look.

I am not a big fan of their Chai Tea which is super super sweet (lots of honey)...I wasn't expecting the real thing, but at least, not so sweet (this may be good for some people though).

Food is average, but I think this place is more of a tea/coffee place (if you really can't find anything else in the area). Can't beat location as it is right in the Sheppard (subway accesible) Mall and close to the movies."}
{"text":"Yes, I continue to go back...but what can I say, it's close to my apartment, and I'm lazy.

Service was still the worst - ever - but this time, the black napkins dyed our hands, and faces black. Can we say, perm"}
{"text":"Went to their Richmond Hill location (East Beaver Creek plaza) early December after it was recently opened about a month prior. Considering the ridiculous amount of business other restaurants in the plaza get, my guess is that word hadn't caught on yet with this place cause it was EMPTY on a Friday night. 

The Mocha Crunch cake was great - meringue & mousse were light, and LOTS of almonds. Their serving sizes can definitely be shared - I foolishly ordered it for myself alone and ended up struggling to finish it.

A friend ordered the Fudge Brownie Cheesecake which was literally.. chocolate crust - cheesecake layer - brownie layer. Very dense, from what I remember. Also a feat to eat by yourself (again, not recommended).

Considering our conversation kept getting interrupted as one of us would suddenly realize something else awesome & comment-worthy about the decor...I'd say they did a pretty nice job - classy & modern."}
{"text":"From the outside this cafe appears to be very nondescript, when you enter through the side door however a trendy lounge unfolds. Rows of low contemporary couches and cozy table settings fill this multilevel cafe and lend for a casual environment, where one can grab a coffee or a full entree. It is unusual to see a \"cafe\" that serves such a wide variety of coffees, desserts and entrees. Their dessert counter was full of various delicacies and the three page menu lended to even the most colorful of palates. I was out with the girls for a late night chirp-fest, and thus iced coffees and appetizers were on our agenda. After the frothy frozen latte, I could barely consume the bruschetta and calamari. After a few bites however, I made room. The calamari were not your usual over fried mini bites, but rather large looping seasoned morsels. Homemade tzaiki finished the bite perfectly, as the greek yogurt cut through the light garlic and greek seasoning with ease. The bruschetta will get an OK only as the bruschetta itself was over chopped and parsley-d. It was a healthy portion and several members of the party thought that it was great. All in all the calorie-fest was worth every penny. The only thing that dropped this from a four to a three star, was the lack of reliable service. Though we were spoken to relatively quickly, our waitress left halfway through the meal, and her replacement was forgetful and a little bit dippy. She forgot several of our drinks, and all requests for refills fell on deaf ears. I'm sure that a different waitress may turn this 3 star into a 4. Bottom line, a return visit is in order, and hopefully the service won't be a mirage. (pun intended)"}
{"text":"Whenever I've come to this location I haven't had to wait that long for seating and the waitresses aren't pushy or come bother you all the time - they leave you alone and are pretty friendly. Every time I go there I always order the roast beef sandwich and they always make it amazing every time. 

I love that dish and the last time I was there, I came walking in through the mall and two men seated at the front immediately noticed me and stood up to greet me and were so friendly/helpful. The gentleman who took my order also told me he would heat up the roast beef himself so it wouldn't take that long and the time before that actually, I ordered the exact same thing without the fries and paid less, however the chef by accident added fries and didn't charge me extra! 

I have also come here with friends as well and even then we had great service and good food with minimal supervision and a very laid back setting which to me didn't bother me at all. With the prompt and friendly service that they have displayed thus far, I will for sure be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cafe Mirage.  This is one of my favourite places for a nice & simple dinner with friends or a late night snack/drink/dessert.

The Entrees:
Their entrees are great and the portions are huge.  I'm always satisfied with any of their salads or their seafood dishes.  The best part is they will cater to my dietary needs (gluten and dairy free).

The vegetarian chile is also really good!

The Desserts:
All of their desserts are phenomenal from their crepes, to their waffles, cakes and ice-creams.  The best gluten/dairy free option is the mocha crunch cake... yumm... delis!!!

The Drinks:
The drinks are amazing from their alcoholic beverages to their coffees/lattes and specialty hot chocolates.

You should definitely try the Nutella Hot Chocolate!  It is scrumptious.  They also have soy milk for any lactose free clientele.

The Ambiance:
The ambiance is great.  It's really pretty, sophisticated and comfortable.  I love the chandelier at the end of the restaurant.

I highly recommend this restaurant.

The Waiters are friendly and attentive.

You definitely have to check out this amazing cafe  :)"}
{"text":"I was in the area for drinks and dessert after dinner with a couple of friends today. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to share and pitcher of sangria. The cake and sangria was good but the environment and service was substandard.

ENVIRONMENT:
There was an abundance of fruit flies and mosquitoes in the dining area that I can only imagine what it's like in the kitchen.

SERVICE:
It took more than 30 minutes to close the bill because our server neglected our table. They also refused to honour a $10 gift certificate because it was not signed. I feel it is unacceptable to fault the customer for oversight by their own employee when this gift certificate was issued.

Parking in the underground lot is normally covered by the restaurant so my friend (who drove) asked to have her parking slip scanned.  Our server explicitly confirmed that he had done so but as we exited the parking garage realized this was not the case. We ended up paying the daily maximum parking fee.

All in all we left with $17 dollars less than we should have and a very disappointed experience with this establishment.

CONCLUSION:
Customer service is a distinguishing factor in today's competitive environment and this restaurant doesn't cut it. I will never return and I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick dinner weeknight, our server was real nice and cheerful, ordered the pizza (as it was listed as freshly made in the kitchen) and did not disappoint.  there was abit of an accident on the ocean harvest (and there were way too much of grilled pepper in the dish), but the manager got it taken care of for us diligently.  Decent place overall."}

Lounge-y. Had the tuna salad which was enough for 3 ppl but I was there with a pal before a movie (hey park underground, cinema validates parking  m-f after 5:00 p.m.)

coffee's look good, all day breakfast. Kinda funny having all day breakfast in a spot with waterfall chandeliers. 

Service was attentive. 

Anyways, it works. I like it."}

I miss the old ambience with roman cathedral like ceiling and paintings. However the fancier glitzier chandelier is not bad. They can sure work on their drink menu a bit more. Maybe improve their wine selection. However the  Chocolate brownie waffle is my to go for many years in the past and many years to come."}

{"text":"This newly renovated (within the year) Cafe Mirage got a much needed face lift! It looks pretty hip now, but would it live up to it's new kicked up image? That was the question my friend, when I went today for lunch.... 

If nothing else the staff are extremely friendly and personable! It was pretty empty when we went (apparently Monday's are the worst day of the week).  I ordered a veggie burger as a recommendation from the waitress and my compadra ordered their smoked salmon salad.  My meal overall was pretty good.. The only complaint I had was that something in my burger tasted like the freezer.  I'm not sure if it was the bun or the actual burger, but it had a definite freezer-like taste.  My fries were nice and crispy though, I enjoyed those thoroughly! 

My co-worker seemed to enjoy her salmon salad, and it did look pretty fresh (at least the lettuce did, I'm not experienced with smoked salmon to make that observation).  Pricewise was a little pricey for lunch in my opinion. I do believe they use the same menu for lunch and dinner, which would explain the dinner-like price point.  I wanted a pasta initially, but the one I wanted was $14.99.. It was a little hefty considering it was lunch and I wasn't paying, so I didn't want to seem like I was taking advantage of the situation.  

All and all, I'd go back, but would probably order something different. I'm eyeing the greek salad.. Look out baby!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Sunday night. Going in, having read the reviews I prepared myself for the worst, and came out being pleasantly satisfied. 

Lets start with building itself... When I look at the place I think someone wanted to make a restaurant that looks like a Moxies, without spending the same budget on the decor. It came off as fake fanciness and being attached to a mall doesn't help it at all. Another big problem is that they were letting people go out and smoke on their patio but as people came and went gusts of smoke would filter into the room (including one fellows stanky cigar aromas). The bathrooms were at least nice.

Next, on to the drinks... Tap selection of beer was pretty weak, only being able to choose between Mill St Organic and Tankhouse, or Ricards Red. I went with the Organic, while my date chose some kind of blue martini ($8.5) from the drink menu.

We were there for a later dinner, so decided to just split an app and went for the Pita Pizza ($8). It is exactly what it sounds like. A pita, with some sauce and cheese and some sliced red peppers and chicken pieces on top, cut into quarters. Basic, but was what we expected and was actually pretty good.

For the mains, despite the pretty extensive menu, we were both attracted to the Tuscan Chicken ($18). Normally it almost seems like a faux pas to order the same thing at the table but we went ahead with a couple variations in which salad we ordered it with an which kind of potato. I had the caesar salad while she had the organic house salad. My caesar salad was bland and a bit watery, whereas hers was appparently quite good. The tuscan chicken was actually pretty delicious though, both with the garlic mashed and baked potato options.

A few beers and a couple mix drinks ($5 for a cranberry and vodka) later we decided to have some dessert. We opted for a cappuccino ($5) and Fudge Brownie Cheesecake ($7). The cheesecake was quite tasty. Not groundbreaking in any dessert worlds, but still pretty good.

The service was a bit un-attentive, but our server was nice and it did seem like the waitresses were pretty stretched out between al the tables, but the service didn't really get any better when the place started clearing out later into the meal so take that as you will.

All in all... The meal was pretty good without any real complaints. While I wasn't necessarily impressed, I was satisfied enough that I'd consider going back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, what I love the most is the selection of cakes!
I love absolutely love anything that is sweet and baked, and cake is my favorite. 
The coffee is pretty good too. The place defiantly has a lounge feel to it.
And the salad plates are quite funky. 

I would recommend any of their desserts."}
{"text":"I'm really on the fence between 1* and 2*.  I hate slating places if it wasn't ALL bad, but there weren't many redeeming qualities..

We went as a group on a Friday after our other options were 2+ hour waits.  When asked about what they had on tap, the hostess who sat us sounded rude when she said 'your server can tell you that', but I think she was just shy since she was so young.  Our server was pleasant enough, but loved to chat - there was no sense of urgency at all.

The time it took for drinks to arrive at our table was absolutely ridiculous.  After our first order, the server came back to say half the drinks weren't available.  It then took at least 20 more minutes for my drink to arrive.  We even started ordering two drinks at a time.  The place was almost empty and there were plenty of servers, so I cannot even fathom what the issue was.

The food was presented well, but in general it was mediocre at best.  The caesar salad tasted exactly like the ready-to-make bags you get at the grocery store.  My pizza was pretty lame and the reviews of the steaks weren't great.  The food was slowish coming out, but additionally we got things we specifically didn't order (like a shrimp skewer on a steak) and soups coming out after the mains, all of which of course was on our bill.  

At the end, they gave us two huge plates of dessert, which is a nice gesture and we were thankful.  But by then we just wanted to get out of there!  We were obviously drinks-focused, so a smart manager would have comped a round or two of drinks.

All I'm saying is that there's a reason this place is always empty.  Seems like nice people working there, but they have to get their act together if they want to compete with all the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've just discovered this place recently and have been back several times.

The first time I went I ordered one of their pasta dishes.  It was so delicious!  The portions were huge too!!  I could hardly finish, and took it home to have for lunch the next day.  Definitely worth my money :)

My friends and I also held our Kris Kringle here in December.  It was great, they blocked off our own private area.  I ordered a waffle this time, and it was so big that I had to share with my fiance.

Would recommend to everyone, and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Had brunch and dessert at here couple times. It's a nice cafe with little classy touch. Good place for a quite brunch or just to have a nice conversation with friends before or after movie.


At most recent visit, I had Egg Victoria : pouched egg with smoked salmon on english muffin in their house hollandaise. It comes with small salad with no dressing, potato and few fruits. Pouched eggs and potato were perfectly cooked. I enjoyed a lot. However, their hollandaise sauce was lack of flavour and quite powderly. It took all the enjoyment of pouched eggs away. Also salad was really dried that I felt like I was eating wet paper. I also had a fresh fruit shake and espresso. Fruit shake was just a mix of fresh fruit and juice. Both weren't bad.

Not sure about why people love their dessert so much tho. They are all okay but nothing really stood out for me. There are many other place with better desserts. 

Service was bit slow but very attentive. My server came by to check and ask how we are doing. It was not too less or too often. It was just perfect.

I will definitely recommend this place to people who are looking for a quite hang out spot or late classic brunch. But if you are looking for dinner, this place is okay but not the best."}
{"text":"I've been to this place, but the one in Scarborough.

It's more of a late night eatery/chill joint for the young crowd.

They have everything under the sun on their menu from pizza, pastries, cakes, etc.

They have lounge couches and tables set up. It has a Roman times feel because of the murals on the walls. 

Fond Memory: I remember observing this one couple out on their first date in which the guy looked completely disinterested in the girl with that \"get me out of here\" face.  Haha. People watching is so amusing sometimes."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until recently.  Tucked away on the 3rd floor of the North York Center, Mirage Grill & Lounge apparently has one other location in the Scarborough area near Scarborough Town Centre.

Arriving one late snowy afternoon for lunch, I was surprised at the relaxed, dark wooden decor that would otherwise belong in a chic restaurant like Moxies or Milestones.  It had more of a lounge seating that doesn't reflect the name on its signage, Cafe Mirage.  

Having been informed that this place is under brand new management, I was invited to try this place out from my usual spots of Joon's or Nome Izakaya across the street!  

We were warmly greeted at the door by the hostess, who showed us promptly to our table. A gentleman working on the laptop in the corner near the entrance took great interests in how and where the hostess was taking us to, of whom I can only assume was the manager or the new owner. He had multiple copies of the menus nearby and didn't wear the restaurant's uniform.

Anyway, upon seating in their very comfortable dark cushioned seating, our waitress took our drink orders. I had a Stella while the others in my group ordered beer as well.  Quickly glancing at the menu, it was very similar to Moxie's or Milestones, maybe even Pickle Barrel.  However, the presentation more elegant and was packed with photos of the foods, savouring our appetites of what would be a great meal to come.   The dessert section at the back of the menu featured a huge plate of waffles and two different kinds of ice cream drizzled with chocolate syrup and strawberry syrup, topped with whip cream.

Today, the pastas section won me over as I ordered something seldom seen at most non-Italian restaurants: spaghetti bolognese. The others in my group ordered the NY Steak, and the all day breakfast featuring 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes with toasts and fruit medley.

After 10-15 minutes, our food came.  During the wait, our waters were filled up without asking, our waitress came around and asked if we wanted more beer as well.

I was delighted with how my spaghetti bolognese came in what must be the coolest pasta plate/bowl hybrid I've ever seen. It looked very fancy like it belonged in a much higher end restaurant.   I was all too eager to bite into the pasta.

The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was not too thick nor too watery, it was just right. There were ample ground beef in the sauce, just like it should be bursting with flavor. It tasted better than any spaghetti bolognese I've had in a long time. There was also a wedge of garlic bread that came with the spaghetti.  Did I mention that portions were bigger than meets the eye? For around $17 for this dish, you get more than your money's worth!  I really enjoyed the sauce, subtle hints of tomatoes, garlic, chive danced around with the marinated ground beef in a medley of flavor!   

Alas, I could not finish my lunch and had to take it away.  

A quick survey of my friends whom were with me and they too enjoyed their meals and thought the portions were more than they expected.  

One of them ordered the dessert I briefly mentioned earlier in my review.  I fell into temptation and had to try it and my goodness, by the end I was ready to blow at the seams.  Two large full slices of waffles, a few scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, topped with syrups and strawberries...  We tried and tried and finally was able to finish it. 

Throughout the meal we noticed that the place was getting more and more busier, surprising as it was a Sunday afternoon around 3-4pm.  A lot of people seem to come here for the desserts at this time, something I would find out later that this place is known for.

Despite being grand at desserts, their regular food menu offerings weren't too bad at all.

I'll definitely be back to try their other foods like their salmon, or eggs benedict as they also do brunch. We left satisfied with Mirage, and would definitely consider coming back, having had a great experience on our visit.

They also validate parking when you park underground in the North York Center's garage."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Mirage today to celebrate a couple of birthdays.  It wasn't too busy and our orders were processed fairly quickly.  We were all pretty happy with the food and the service was pretty good.  I've been here numerous times over the last few years and I'd recommend it.   Cheers..."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised by our Valentine's Day lunch today.  I was apprehensive when we walked in at 1 PM for a late-ish lunch.  We were 2 of 4 people eating at the establishment.  Don't know why there's not much more traffic there.  Started off with the chicken wing appetizer and a mixed green salad.  The chicken wings were perfectly crispy on the inside and coated with BBQ sauce on the outside with just the right amount of acid/vinegar.  I had a turkey club sandwich with fries and my husband had the steak with mashed potatoes.  Both were very good.  I had a delicious smoothie and husband had a glass of wine.  All in all, I would definitely come back.  Mirage does have an extensive menu, which again, left me a little wary initially, but I can post my pics here and you'll see what I'm talking about for some good eats and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"It was empty. SOO very empty on a Tuesday evening (I guess that's why).  They were closing at 12:00 PM (when the website and the time on the doors said 1 AM).

Service was okay.

However, nachos were horrible.   Cheese wasn't melted very well, and it just... wasn't right.

Dessert was mediocre as well.  My friends and I shared the \"day and night\" waffle (is that what it was called? It basically had the vanilla and chocolate ice cream together).  For some reason, the waffle tasted stale, and the ice cream had large chunks of ice in them.

Unimpressed."}
{"text":"We had 20 people that day.  I was really surprised that they even allowed a bunch of us there (although, we did have reservations).  Service was really great considering that we had 20+ yapping young adults who almost sat there for about an hour trying to decide what to get.  We even got separate bills.

I ordered the Supercrema di Gianduja: New York style cheesecake coated with Nutella spread, dressed with fresh bananas and thick chocolate fudge.  It's to die for.  All my friends were in love with it, and I was quite the happy girl.  

Cafe Mirage is a place for desserts, but not suggested for entrees or dinners. 

Great plus: Also, you can get your parking pass validated if you parked downstairs at Sheppard Centre!"}
{"text":"My rating of the restaurant is based on a recent dinner experience. My party ordered the farfelle, tortellini, and linguini dishes. We all agreed that pasta is not their strength. My linguini came with 4 pieces of shrimp, a bland cream sauce and some wilted spinach for $16. I've been to many restaurants in that neighbourhood and many of them are pretty good but this one is NOT the place to go for dinner especially pasta. Maybe that's why it was empty when we went in at 6pm. 

Service was friendly, although we had a wrong order, but it was taken care promptly. Decor is nice and chic. Bathrooms were trendy though lighting is very dark inside. And just a side bar, all but one stall had toilet paper available. 

All this said, I do think this place would be nice for drinks and desserts. As we were getting ready to leave, I smelled some delicious intoxicating coffee brewing in the background. I was almost tempted to stay for that if my dinner wasn't so disappointing.  And I know their cakes are pretty good if they use the same supplier as the location in Scarborough. Overall, I would recommend this place for desserts and coffee after a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night at 8:30.  The place was less than half full, but yet service was slow and less than attentive.  

Our friends had pasta dishes which were served with a caesar salad as an appetizer.  The friend's comments were not favourable as the salad was over-dressed.  The pasta itself was tolerable but salty.  We had a smoked salmon appetizer for two, which was ok.

It was a cold evening and the layout of this place allows all the cold air to blow in, meaning that because we were seated near the door, we were freezing all evening.  

Our server was not knowledgeable about the menu, and when asked for their martini selection said \"Off the top of my head, we have chocolate, lychee, cosmo, or we can make what you want.\"  Not what I expected from this type of establishment.

I would not go again."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy the decor here and the service. I have been a going here for awhile and the girls always make it feel like home. 
From the smoothies to Martinis to the latte's I like the fact I have so many drink selections. 
The food is out of this world especially the Tuscan chicken. I also love their all day breakfast menu. 
As well today I tried their all you can eat Mediterranean menu, for 14$ it's amazing ! You seriously can not go wrong !"}
{"text":"We frequent Cafe Mirage at Kennedy Commons, so we popped in for dinner on a Friday night. 

My mom and I shared a pesto bowtie pasta with vegetables. As Rainie also reviewed, it's edible but definitely not their forte. The asparagus soup came out piping hot but it tasted strangely sour and was heavily salted. 

The dip and pita platter ($11) came with fresh carrot sticks, celery sticks, pita and salad with a light dressing. Everything with it was fine, except that my mom thought there was vinegar in the hummus. When I tried it, it burned my mouth; I had to explain to her that hummus is never made with vinegar. We were, in fact, served food that had gone rancid. We told the waiter, who kindly took it back and gave us baba ghanoush instead, but neither he nor the manager came out to apologize. You'd think you'd be embarrassed if you gave your customers something like that! 

Definitely will not be coming back here. Music here is also terrible."}
{"text":"We wwent to the Richmond Hill location.

The worst experience i have ever had in my life.

The waitress was over friendly first of all maybe because she knew what was to come.  The food tasted like microwave everything.  They even screwed up with the salad.

They forgot my order twice and when the food came it was already 45 mins.  To add to the insult, while they had forgot my order the second time, a friend got his and sent his steak back because it was so bad.  That made me cancel my order.  The manager tried to make us happy by sending us a free pizza.  Who was the cook?  Someone who is unfamiliar to cooking in general.  We refused to pay because we didnt even eat anything.

WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.

Beware!

{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant.  My boyfriend brought me here because he said they have a really good dessert menu but by the time we got there we were hungry and ordered dinner instead. He had a chicken Caesar salad and sweet potato fries. Probably one of the best sweet potato fries I've ever tried! Seasoned well and just delicious and his salad was good too. I had this shrimp pasta don't remember the name it was a white sauce. Absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the sauce was mixed in with the pasta and it was sitting it a pot for a while in the back and they plopped in in my plate and served it to me. I ate the garlic toast and the shrimp and left the pasta. The pasta was sticking together it was just gross.  The service was ok nothing to rave about. It was the end of the night and I guess they don't have a staff area out of sight because they were all just chillin and chattin in the corner. Doesn't bother me but I'm sure it would both others. I still want to go back for dessert though."}
{"text":"I invited a friend to go there last night, which was a Saturday. The place was packed and my friend thought the place is classy. I wouldn't entirely agree with him though. The people there were dressed from classy to business casual.
The Hawaiian pizza we split was great and we liked our drinks. My only problem was with the waiter who was a slim nerdy looking guy with glasses. I have a feeling he is Indian or Pakistani. I could be wrong though. He kept calling me \"love\", which is an entirely inappropriate term to refer to a customer whom you don't know. I was like excuse me? I didn't realize we're on a date! He forgot to bring back the menu after half an hour and he was sort of standing by our table every 5 minutes to eavesdrop and see if we're ready to leave.  Utterly disturbing attitude! I hope the manager teaches him how to treat lady customers in the future."}
{"text":"I'm sort of on the fence about this place. I've walked past Mirage numerous times, usually on the way to the Sheppard Grande. It always looked like such a posh place, hence the bar was set high. That's why I was rather disappointed when I walked in for the first time. My disappointment was little to do with the food and more to do with the service. During the weekdays, the vast floor is covered by only a couple of waiting staff, and given the strange and labyrinth-like seating, it may be almost impossible to get their attention.   

Food: 6/10
Service: 3/10"}
{"text":"Cafe Mirage's Richmond Hill location is brand new only opened for a week or 2. 

Nice and chic decorated. There are 2 big sections at the back and in the front with big windows letting the sunlight filtering in. So it is nice no matter when you go all day breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

Dropped by for lunch using Groupon. My waiter was really courteous, friendly and attentive. (+1 star) Sometimes you do get frowned on when using coupons or waitstaffs giving you a hard time. Here my coupon was more than welcome! 

Bistro Burger ($10) 
- meh... the meat patties really over seasoned . (TOO Salty!) The bun a little over toasted 
- fries was really crispy.. supermarket frozen standard... 

Italian Sodas Mango Flavour ($4) 
- Nice and refreshing.. not overly sweet 

Bistro Latte with Amaretto shot ($6) 
- The best part of the meal, liquid dessert!! Yummy! 

In general I found the food a little overpriced...the food is meh...at least the one that I have. But Cafe Mirage might be a good place to drop by for a drink and chill out with your friends."}
{"text":"Caf√© Mirage's over expansion resulted in their demised over the years. Many of their operations had shut down in 2011 and 2012. The lack of quality control is an indication of design failure. It was apparent that Mirage had many scalability issues. There were too many menu options. Mirage had lost sight of their core competencies.The restaurant was filled with performance bottlenecks."}
{"text":"This place is just awful. I had major food poisoning after having a tuscan chicken dish. They gave me 5 pieces of chicken - all of them had gone bad - the sauce itself tasted like it had gone bad... I was really really hungry, so I ignored my gut feeling that it tasted off... and I ended up sick the entire night. The place is also completely empty, I should have known better."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and thought it would be a cool little place to grab dessert or a beverage. Cafe Mirage was packed the Friday night I ventured in, and instantly thought that I had found a great place to unwind over a beer. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. I had to wait forever to order another drink and was never proactively asked if I wanted anything else. It took so long for the server to come back and ask about another drink or the bill, that I had to actually get up and go to the counter and ask if I could receive the bill. 

I don't want to provide a poor review based on what could be just a poor server, but it certainly tainted my view of Cafe Mirage. Hopefully, I have better luck next time......if there is one..."}
{"text":"The menu here is pretty much the same as the other locations, with a good selection of cr√™pes, waffles, sundaes and cakes. Caf√© Mirage also serves lunch and dinner food, but I've never eaten here other than for desserts. On this occasion, one of our party ordered the perfect couple: one side of the plate features a single scoop of small-batch vanilla ice cream covered in fresh berries and strawberry pur√©e. The other boasts a scoop of rich chocolate ice cream and sliced fresh bananas dripping with silky chocolate syrup. The cr√™pe is huge, so sharing is highly recommended. One notable feature is that some parts of the cr√™pe are crispy, almost like a biscuit, which some people really like. I personally prefer the usual soft texture. 

I ordered the New York Cheesecake with a choice of pur√©e, and I opted for blueberry. Although they garnished my cake with real blueberries, the \"pur√©e\" didn't taste like blueberries at all! I also didn't like the flavour of the cake itself, as it didn't taste very cheesecake-like."}
