{"text":"We visited in May 2018 and had a sampler of momos - 5 of each chicken, pork and veggie. All are mildly spicy and very delicious! The owner is very friendly and made sure we were happy and asked for feedback. We were surprised that at 5-6 pm in the evening on monday there were so few visitors, since the momos are absolutely delicious and freshly made! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"moÂ·mo  /m?m? Noun (in Tibetan cooking) a steamed dumpling filled with meat or vegetables.  If you don't know now you know.    If you happen to drive in this area and notice this somewhat hidden and inconspicuous restaurant front, your first thought might be, \"Burgers and momos? What the heck are momos and what do they have to do with burgers?\" Well, besides sharing a fleeting similarity in it's ingredient of ground meat, almost nothing. So why are they both offered and presented as the name of the restaurant? Probably in an effort to substantiate the lesser known Tibetan cuisine with something ostentatiously Western.   Now, aside from the peculiar name, the mo-mos here are serious business. Served with a side of what I only know as momo sauce, these succulent little steam cooked suckers come in 3 varieties of filling including chicken, pork and vegetarian. Slightly doughier than Japanese gyoza's (but not overly so), they each contain a good amount of filling. I personally liked the vegetarian ones the best but my lunch buddies preferred the pork which had a delicious soupy filling and others the chicken (try them all!). Now, I wouldn't say they're the best momo's I've had, but they certainly rank up there. If I had to go back for one thing here though, it's their Everest noodles (they're SO good!). It's not advertised on the menu, but you can ask for them and they'll know what you're talking about. It's a little oily, but pack a serious punch of flavor and packed full of chicken and veggies. Between the five of us, we had 4 plates of momos and 2 plates of noodles which was WAY more than enough. We could barely stand after this meal and struggled to finish the last 10 momos. Price wise, each plate ranged between $8.99 - $9.99 and included one canned drink which I thought was more than fair.   5 stars for good food, good pricing and a passionate business owner who made sure we enjoyed everything. It's not fancy, but for a quick lunch or dinner, it works. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Finally, i found the place to satiate my all time craving for momos and I have become a huge fan of their nepali momos. Being a traditional delicacy of nepal, they made the momos so authentically that every time you have the momos, you can't get enough of them. I have tried both chicken and veggie momos and both are best at their level. In case you don't want to team up momos with momo sauce which is spicy, try for chipotle sauce.  Portion size is good enough and liked their packaging of food whick keeps the food warm. Food is genuinly priced and worth the amount spent."}
