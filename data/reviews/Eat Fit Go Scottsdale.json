{"text":"Concept, presentation, appropriate portions and customer service all good, but the deal breaker? The actual ingredients in the food!!!   How can you market your product as healthy and use hydrogenated oil (aka trans fat)? Everything seems to have sugar also or even worse, chemical sugars. In general, if you scrutinize the labels on the meals there are far too many ingredients.  The food tastes processed.  It reminds me of the nutrition labels for programs such as Nutra-System--- they read like a chemistry text book.  Yuck. I've done several meal plans in other cities and they were fresh and far more simply made.  It can be done.  Also disappointing amount of vegetables in the meals. Primarily meat and carbs.   Marketing for convenience is one thing, but don't deceive people into thinking they are getting something truly natural & good for you when it's far from it.  It's also expensive to add insult."}
{"text":"The people who work there are very nice, helpful and knowledgeable. The food isn't powdery, not sure what the last review was talking about. Never had anything dry or lacking in quality. It is pretty pricey but if it's what works for you, you can't put money on health until you're in the hospital or on medications."}
{"text":"This is must try for seekers of healthy fresh homemade style food. plenty of parking and if you don't take your food with you you can eat it at either a counter or a table."}
{"text":"With all honesty the first time I came here I got very good service with a guy that works here I got my food he told me which one was better tasting with good quality and good proteins and he gave me what I wanted it was really good and he also offered me a cup of water which I really respected and liked the place I respected the hospitality and I expected the next time I come around it would be the same respect but I just walked in here today and I got the same thing but this time a girl was working and she never asked me if I would like a cup of water or anything so I went to her and ask her if I can have a cup of water and she said no we cannot do that I wish she gave gave me a cup of water because I really like this place but now I am never going to recommend this place to anybody they should start giving free water cups because I'm paying for an expensive plates"}
{"text":"The customer service was great, But the food isn't worth the price at all. The meats seem to be very dry and all the food is powdery tasting. The meals seem to lack the required nutrients needed to maintain a healthy balance. Its great if you dont like to cook and do want to begin meal prep and like I said the sales associates are super helpful."}
{"text":"Quick healthy food. I have been grabbing lunch  and sometimes breakfast here for about a month now. The staffs is helpful and friendly. Typically they have 4-6 different options to heat up right in the shop.  Pasta & Chicken was good, Salmon and rice is my favorite. It's not going to be the most flavorful dish you ever had, but it's clean and low fat that's hot and ready in 2minutes!  I grab a few for the fridge to snack on later.   *Price: Small and Large portions available. Smalls run $8-$9, Larges are $10-$12 range.   Starting to really like this place, because cooking simply takes TIME"}
{"text":"I popped into this Eat Fit Go location after a lunchtime retail therapy session at Nordstrom... I was in need of something healthy and quick to take back to the office with me and fuel me up for a productive afternoon.  Zack helped me by giving me the lay of the land... he pointed out which refrigerators had breakfast meals, lunch meals, dinners, snacks, and kids cuisine.  He also pointed out the packaging which clearly states the \"packed on\" date and an \"consume by\" date, as well as the different sizes and nutrition information.  I love that!  The space is modern and clean and the perfect layout for what they offer.  The prices seem a bit high, but quality seems high and if you're shooting to eat clean, one could argue it's worth it.  I ended up with an Asian Citrus Salad... it was just over $12 and perfect for the occasion.  While I don't think I'll go out of my way to become a regular here anytime soon, I'd absolutely pop in again for a meal or snack on the go... It's also worth mentioning that they do have a \"PERFECT WEEK\" option for people to purchase meals for an entire week - not sure if there is a discount when you do that but I like the EFG philosophy / belief in the 80/20 rule - \"nourish your body correctly for 80% of the time and indulge a little 20% of the time.\"  It's all about moderation!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Wish I had money to buy franchise. Simple, neat and clean space and eating."}
{"text":"A super cool concept, but the foods quality was not worth the price.. at all. My boy friend and I both did a weeks worth of meals which was totaling in $280... FOR ONE WEEK. I repeat, one week! It would be one thing if the food was actually good. The eggs they use for breakfast were definitely the kind that is powered in little packages, the food was extremely bland and the pasta I had wasn't even cooked all the way! If you're gonna spend that kind of money for a weeks worth of food  I would hope that the quality and taste would be at its best. Once again, cool concept but.. nah.."}
{"text":"Very expensive, $189/week for 5 days worth of meals.  For that price, I'd better be getting large portions of steak and lobster.  I could swing $100/week as it would replace 90% of my groceries, but when you start creeping up to nearly $200 a week and almost $800 a month for 5 days worth of meals, the value just goes down.  Neat idea though, not very practical."}
{"text":"Lucky for me they did not take my 20% off coupon to get a week's worth of meals so I just got a few meals to try instead. It really just is not worth it. the quality of food is lacking and the thought of having healthy food and microwaving them in plastic is concerning. I give two stars because the staff is friendly but when I complained about one of the six meals that I did try they did not offer me a discount or another meal. The pasta in the smart chicken parmesan was hard and as if it was not cooked when I complained they basically told me that it was the way I was microwaving it it felt very condescending and I do know how to microwave and follow directions as to what they have on the package. I also had tried the salmon Alfredo where the pasta was dry, lacking sauce. I tried to breakfast and the ground turkey looked like dog food I just fed my dogs and was sprinkled with egg whites.... In both breakfast s, I was reminded of experiences if eating airline food. I give two stars because I did enjoy the Asian citrus chicken salad and friendly staff....but I feel when a customer complains, especially a newly opened off Scottsdale Road, they would want to make that customer happy because Word of Mouth means alot. Don't just blame customer.  I do know how to read directions or use a microwave...will I be back. Me thinks not."}
