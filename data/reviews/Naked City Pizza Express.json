{"text":"My first time at this location, and the staff was very rude for no reason at all. I was there to pick up a order, and this ignorant blonde was taking my orders was just rude. No greeting, no nothing just rude. You all need to fire her. I will not be coming back, and I will tell my family and friends don't ever go here. I will not recommend anyone doing business at this place. Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"I have tried every weekend for the last month to order a pizza from this place. I've called, been put on hold for 15+ minutes, and then every other time all I get is a busy signal. This place is a pathetic excuse for a business."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza ever.  I always order the guinea pie and substitute pepperoni for meatballs.  #gameover"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. Lady on the phone wasn't friendly. I got a chop salad and it had olives in it that wasn't listed on the menu. I didn't think olives would be in the vegetable category as they are on the menu.   I should have asked but thought olives would be listed separately. It was $9.50 and not good at all. The fries were also very soggy. Cheese pizza was ok nothing over the top. Maybe their specialty pizzas are better. If you want a salad, go to McDonald's for one."}
{"text":"Awesome semi-deep dish pizza. Still has the dive-bar feel of the Moondoggie's location. I used to go to the original location once in a while, as the pizza was worth a 30-minute drive, but now that it's only a few minutes away it will likely be a regular meal. 

My wife and I polished off a quarter sheet with a slice left over. I'd definitely recommend the Bianco and the \"Back Home,\" although just plain cheese is delicious as well."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars I'd give them.  The pizza and fries were soggy and oily  we were sick for 2 days. I 'm assuming the folks giving great stars haven't had great food in some time.
this wasn't worth 46.23 and to be sick all weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Had the naked city special with no onions. Awesome! Also had the suicide fries, definitely hot but I couldn't stop eating them."}
{"text":"Best pizza within 10 miles, as for service ive only been there on off hours and never had a problem.  Complaints of a smoky bar is valid, but it is a bar.  Pizza is a tad salty like other reviews say, but the pizza is great. Ive personally never had a service issue here.  The pizzas really good

Steak sandwiches tho barely have any meat, french fries r good even the suicide ones ( heat is high but tolerable).

Pizza and fries r a 5 star, sandwich is like a 2.5"}
{"text":"Had no idea what I was missing out on. This is good pizza, thick pan style. I had the back home. Cant wait to try more. Best pizza in southwest"}
{"text":"They can't seem to work out how to serve dinning guest and the influx of uber, postmates, food delivery people, so they royally fuck up and burn your pizza to shit at this location after you wait forever for it.  So dissapointed the naked city pizza near us is this total shit show."}
{"text":"Pre ordered pizza and wings for the McGregor fight last night. It was a hit of the party. Always great food! Thanks guys keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews first about the wings now I believe somebody got paid to write reviews apparently.!sitting at the window to order took 5 minutes of being ignored and finally got his attention. Took 25 minutes for the worst wings in my life. Asked what kind of sauce I wanted I replied extra ranch but get home to one blue cheese smh at this point 10wings and the wrong sauce no flavor or heat for hot and unsalted fries like I'm 90 yrs old. I'm done about the hype about naked city pizza,nice bar and bartender"}
{"text":"Where is the one that was Dinners, Drives and Guy Fierietta. The food chancel guy. 
Ex Jersey guy and pizza out here stinks. Want real stuff and it on the food channel. 
Were is the good place? 
Tell me please. 
Mc"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Im not a fan of your local neighborhood bar but this Pizza express is located inside the bar. Small window to your left as you walk in.  I don't smoke so I pre-order and go in and pick up.  Thinking of visiting the other Naked City locations. Would like to sit down and enjoy the pizza right away!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The quality was really good and the dough wasn't too heavy or rubbery. I would definitely go back and i highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and wings!!! So happy to finally have quality pizza in Mountains Edge!!"}
{"text":"3 Stars because the pizza was actually very good. This was the saving factor for the review. The wings weren't bad either. Overall not satisfied with customer service, set up, or wait time. Delivery was going to take TWO HOURS!! What in the world?! That is ridiculous! So I asked to pick it up instead. I went in to get my order at this tiny window that has no line of sight so you're left waiting awkwardly because you can't see them and they can't see you. Then I'm told with my order one item was not available. I simply asked them to take it off the order and was told \"no I can't\". I'm sorry what? So I'm not getting the product I ordered, yes you offered something else that was not wanted, but refuse to take the expense off if the offered replacement is not taken? This makes zero sense to me. As stated the pizza was good wings were ok too. We will give it another shot some other time and ten update the review here. Not overly impressed yet by this spot."}
{"text":"Ordered fingers med hot and they were very hot and sogy , second time we have tried the food here , 
Love the food at moon doggies 
Please step up your game out here"}
{"text":"Not impressed with their customer service. I ordered from Uber Eats. They sent me the wrong thing. When I called to let them know, I was told I would have to call Uber on my own and take care of it. Then I was told that if I wanted what I actually ordered, I would have to submit another order and pay another delivery fee. Super disappointed with how this was handled."}
{"text":"Grrrreeeaaaat customer service  #nakedcitypizza buffalo ny style pizza and wings. Add a 2 Liter of POP to your order."}
{"text":"Tried to call in an order for pick up ...no answer for 45 mins..went through uber eats ...only to get delivered the WRONG ORDER... show up to the EXPRESS where they attempt to correct just to get home and find out the order is still wrong. I have patronized this place for 7 years. Even after reaching out to the  owner and letting him know about the experience, he passed along to his brother who runs this location.  It's  been over 10 days with no response. No attempt to apologize or make right. I truly love supporting small businesses but this one just lost my loyalty.  My dollars may not run the place but my loyalty was there. I spent $ there, even held an event at a location,  recommended it to others and out of towners for hometown flavor.  Time to find a new place. So sad that a  little success makes you look beyond the \"little people\""}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Why four stars? Frequently under staffed, long wait times, sometimes the phone isn't answered, and it's expensive. However, the quality speaks for itself..."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, the food here is amazing. The customer service is terrible. I have been here 4 times and 3 times they have messed something up. CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE! 
Last time I ordered wings and a pizza, they made wings but not the pizza. The time before that I was told 25 mins to come pick up. I get there and I have to wait an additional 20 more mins because they weren't ready, I'm guessing they messed up someone else's order. On top of that my 1/4 sheet was missing one of my toppings. 

Today, I ordered a pizza and wings w/fries. I check my order, the pizza has the wrong toppings and the wings don't have fries. This place is really frustrating bc the food is awesome! Unfortunately the staff can't be trusted to do anything right. Ironically there is always different people working every time. They will fix the mistakes but by the time I get home my wings or my pizza is cold and nasty. Just get it right the first time! Is that to much to ask? If I'm going to OVERPAY for food I need to have it done right. Unfortunately they will be losing what was a loyal customer. I guess this NYer has to go find decent pizza else where. CHECK YOUR ORDERS people."}
{"text":"This place is gonna be a problem....I worked next to the one on Arville and used to get the guinea ALL the time......and now there is one literally 3 blocks from my house.....hello pounds!!!! Lol!!!! This location is amazing and just as good (if not better) than the original.... the only reason they lose points with me it they don't have poutine!!!! One of my favorite things about the one on arville!!!! PLEASE START MAKING POUTINE!!!!"}
{"text":"Love that this new location is in the southwest! The pizza and wings are top notch, nothing like it in Vegas. It's solid, real food for good prices. You can feed your whole family easily. 

The pizza is amazing but the wings are also fantastic. I love the Sicilian ones- herby and garlicky! 

Stop in today and give them some of your business. You can even order using the yelp app and grab it on the way home. Quit ordering from chain pizza places!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places of course skeptical first time as it's a small window to order food inside a bar but delicious everytime"}
{"text":"Wasted half an hour trying to order on uber eats. I placed an order waited 10 minutes and then it would be cancelled. did this a couple times. Uber eats customer support said the resturant was cancelling the order. thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Had the chicken finger pizza and it was very delicious portion sizes were prefect. I definitely recommend  you to try it out"}
{"text":"Yummy Pizza!! I have had the \"Back Home\" pizza at least 4 times and I just had the \"Rebel\". The  consistency and flavor always meet expectations!  You definitely get what you pay for at Naked City! You will not be disappointed! If your lucky, you will have a delicious lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Doesn't seem sanitary to me...

I was extremely excited to try this place because of reviews and photos of their pizza online. I base almost everything off of reviews because reviews from peers always tell the story, granted there are always garbage reviews that are negligible...regardless. My experience was terrible. 

First off, if you step inside you will be disgusted, unless you like ordering food in a smoke pit. Went early evening, left in two minutes smelling like an ash try. The guy working there was super nice, however, the woman was extremely rude to the other employee while he was taking our order. Talking in a condescending fashion to him and yelling at him while he was talking to us. Not a great second impression. Once we were told it would be a 40 min wait we decided to leave and come back next time to try it, didn't feel like waiting tonight. After leaving (after two minutes like previously stated), I couldn't believe how much we smelled of smoke. Thinking about it, this concerned me as this pizza shop is constantly open to the bar. I don't like the idea of my food being exposed to smoke 24/7 prior to it even getting prepared.

I see other reviews talking of the smoke and most with people ordering delivery. If those of you who order delivery saw the atmosphere your food is prepared in i'm sure you wouldn't be as enthused about the product.

Don't get me wrong, I love bar food and frequent others in town, however, the cook area is never open to the smoke area...never in my experience! Whether it's a door or something that divides them. The ordering window is always open meaning the food is always exposed and at this point, all the food back there has been soaking in the smoke of all the people at the bar for the last few weeks...disgusting the more I think about it. 

In the end, never ate the product, although I'm sure it might be good, just might try another location...definitely not this one"}
{"text":"Food is a definite 4.5 stars
My experience last night brought my rating down to a 3.
I was beyond exited for Naked Coty Pizza to open right down the street from me in Mnt Edge. I had been to their original location inside Moon Doggies and was a fan!! (Not to mention they were featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives....huge fan of that show too)
So what happens when it's pouring down rain all day and the mommy doesn't want to cook...you order pizza of course.
I looked on Yelp at the reviews and menu and the NCP website where they suggested Uber Eats so I downloaded the app and was ready to order.
I placed my order around 5pm and the app said delivery would be around 556pm.... perfect timing because I usually do dinner around 6pm!!
Let's talk food... I ordered one 1/4 sheet which is 6 slices and two 1/2 sheet pizza along with wings and fingers and garlic fries. 
Food is on point sauce on the pizza is a tad salty and pizza could have used a couple more toppings but whatever it's freaking good!!!
Now to the problem.... like I said Uber Eats quoted delivery around 556pm and I know it's not always accurate but my delivery time jumped to 651pm at the time I was supposed to be receiving my food.
After 2 calls to Uber Eats they finally were told by the restaurant that they didn't see my order so they hadn't made it so that's why they added an hour to my time.
I get it mistakes happen but they could have called...it was their mistake.
Anyway we finally got our food around 642 and we were so hungry I didn't take pics but trust me when I say it's GOOD!
I will order again and hope we get the food on time.
Best of luck NCP you have a great product!!"}
{"text":"I always get delivery, so I've never stepped foot in the place, but my family and I have yet to be disappointed by Naked City Pizza Express. We've ordered everything from a plain cheese to the chicken finger pizza and it has all been soooooo good. I don't usually notice details when it comes to food, but Naked City does something to their crust that keeps you going back for more. 

The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the prices can be a liiiiiiiittle steep. That said, you certainly get what you pay for. 

If you're in the area, don't be afraid to hit this place up and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this to open as we have very limited good pizza spots in this area. It is located inside the Blue Diamond Saloon which is very smokey and can be bothersome for some. Depending on how long you have to wait for your pizza, you can potentially come out smelling like an ashtray. 

Pizza: we ordered the Back Home which, for the most part, was good just a little too salty for my taste. Not sure if it was the sauce or the cheese or the sauce AND the cheese. 

We also ordered the garlic buns, which were salty as well and most were burnt on the bottom. 

I think next time we will try another pizza and give it another shot. Lastly, they don't have their own in-house delivery crew. You have to go thru Uber Eats or Bite Squad. Not sure about Bite Squad, but Uber Eats charges a $4.99 fee so I just did pick up."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome. Garlic knots are a must try! Service is awful, they are always so rude and act like customers are an inconvenience. Takes like 40 minutes for an order so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Uber eats delivery.   This was my first time trying the food. I got a pizza with meatballs.  Omg  it was amazing. I got wings , which my daughter ate, and she eats nothing.   I will order them again"}
{"text":"Horrible . Came here for pizza. Nobody is available to help. Asked the pizza lady teoce if she got my online order, she kept saying no. I told her id order ahead since im already there but she wasnt paying any attention to understand that there is a customer who wants pizza. Left because i dont want to deal with any of this poor service."}
{"text":"Okay so we usually go to the full restaurant on Paradise but we were in the area of blue diamond and Rainbow and decided to try Naked City Pizza Express and glad we did it was very good just like back home in New York not too thin not too thick lots of cheese very fresh and hot and the customer service of the guy working was awesome. We ordered a half sheet half cheese half mushroom and it was delicious."}
{"text":"After all the hype given by the local people, we tried this place. The food was okay, not exceptional. It was pricey for the amount served. The place is in a bar pick up window. It was not horrible food, but most likely I will not be back. I am still on the hunt for great East Coast Pizza here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered uber eats on national pizza day. I was excited to try the new pizza express.  The pizza arrived fast and hot.  I ordered a white garlic sauce with 2 items and double cheese.  Cheese was more than generous for a dbl cheese order. My #1 pet peeve with toppings is when charged a considerable amount for each additional item but the pizza shows up looking like a cheese pizza with a couple of zits.  Sorry, there are too many unlimited item pizza places with quality ingredients nowadays. I find it infuriating to pay for items and there is is 1-2 pepperoni per slice or 1-2 sausage per slice. If items are unimportant to you, I think this place is fine."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and most likely my last. I was truly excited to finally try what I saw on Triple D so I ordered the Guinea Pie and Naked Salad.  So I ordered using Grub Hub and live approx a mile away from the location. I was not feeling well otherwise I would have went myself. Anyway, email from grub hub said order should be here about 630-645. No problem maybe 30-45 min. Ended up arriving a little after 7. Once again, not a problem close enough. I eagerly grabbed the food from the delivery girl and ran inside with wife and children waiting. Upon opening the pizza box, I could tell it was a little over cooked (burnt by some standards). I figured well lets give it a shot. Took our first bites and it was like biting into stale cardboard lol. The crust was so hard my dog tried to bury it
In the yard and she never lets pizza crust go to waste. My wife says that it must be from freezing the dough and then cooking it. It was difficult to eat to say the least. So we said at least we have salad. We asked for Ranch to be put on the side if possible instead of vinaigrette and got vinaigrette anyway. Not sure if its an option. So our salad was supposed to have iceberg lettuce and spinach and contained only spinach. Luckily I had $10 off from grub hub otherwise if I would have spent almost $40 on a pizza and salad I would have been pissed for this kind of quality. If I am going to spend that kind of money for a pizza it should be as good as or better than Grimaldis up the road. Never had an issue there. So, so disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly service and the food is EXACTLY like the other Naked City locations. Wings are damn near perfect, and you can't go wrong with the Grandmas Meatball pizza!!!

Reasonably priced, good old fashioned pizza just like from back home in northeast PA. It's even delicious cold out of the fridge the next day :) FANTASTIC all around!!!"}
{"text":"Great location in the Southwest area - definitely the best pizza and wings I've found around there! Good quality food and very reasonable prices. All of the combinations they have are perfect for feeding couples or families. My favorites are the char cup pepperonis and the hot bbq wings! Great options to either order before and pick up, or get it delivered!"}
{"text":"Pizza was big, but for from great. I had no idea this place was a little hole, literally, in the wall inside a smoky bar....not pleasant to say the least. The only way this place I would consider eating here again is if I was piss face drunk and needed food to help sober me up or to help throw up all the alcohol from the bar this place is in."}
{"text":"Called at 7:08 they said my order would be 25-30 mins. I arrived at 7:45, food not ready yet. Had a drink at the bar while I waited. Checked on my food again at 8:15, not ready yet. Finally got my food at 8:20...then I had to bring it back because they gave me the wrong pizza. The employee was arguing with me about why it took so long but agreed it was bad service. Then he shook his tip bucket at me after finally giving me the correct pizza... and there was no arugula in my arugula salad."}
{"text":"Stick with the original location. Like most expansions the customer service and quality is severely lacking in this location. Its unfortunate because the staff and the location is great, but beware of using uber eats grubhub or delivery when you order from here... 

they cancelled an order or left out an item 3 times! Messaged Robert the General Manager and here is his response 

\"I do appologize for this inconvienience but we no longer carry the steak subs at our paradise location. We have recently updated our menu and our deliverie services are still working on updating it on their end.\" 

I checked their website and they still have the sandwiches up. I don't understand the need to lie. Don't blame a 3rd party delivery service when you don't even update your website.

Stay away from their express locations and stick with the main location."}
{"text":"I'm so bad at names, (please forgive me!! Lol) but the gentleman was awesome! He was honest that there was something wrong with the app, as I placed my take out order through YELP. I did wait a few more minutes, probably 15? No biggie though. The bar was obviously smoky, I could have waited outside but I didn't. I have had  Naked City Pizza for years. LOVE their pizzas!! Have had guinea Pie, the breakfast pizza, chicken finger pizza etc.from both Desert Inn location & Office Bar on paradise locations. My office ordered a lot from them! Yesterday was my first time at this BD location though. And first time ordering this steak sandwich! Let me tell you how HEAVENLY  this sandwich tasted!!!  I ordered it for my son and I had way more bites off of his sandwich.  It was DELICIOUS! The fries ended up soggy when we got home but otherwise, it was  TASTY AS HELL. Forget the pizzas! I may just come for the steak sandwich next time!! Please don't ever get rid of this on the Menu!  Thank you again!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Right down the street from my house. Love that I can order it and pick it up. I highly recommend the guignea or back home!! So delicious"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was good. However my kids didn't care for it. And they looove Pizza.  I didn't like the wings. I feel like the wings didn't have a lot of meat on them and lacked flavor. The roasted garlic buns were pretty good."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THIS VIA YELP/GRUBHUB..

they will not make your pizza or deliver.. please remove this ordering option using grubhub, it's a headache talking to multiple people trying to get the order cancelled, not to mention potentially tying up funds in the process.. work your sh!t out please.
wish i could give this 0 stars."}
{"text":"Had never tried their pizza before, but now that they've opened 3 miles from my home, I couldn't wait to give them a try.  EXCELLENT!  I am ordering again in a couple of days for dinner again.  I ordered the 1/4 sheet (6 slices) with pepperoni.  I can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best wings ever! 3 stars because this place never answers their phone. They either have it disconnected or never answer! I wouldn't mind if the food didn't take so long to make."}
{"text":"I went to this location on 11/11/17.  It's inside a bar so I wasn't sure if the quality of the pizza would be good.  However, it was absolutely the best pizza I've had!!!!  In addition, one of the patrons of the bar saw me struggling with an armload of pizza's so he helped me out the door. Great place!!! 

I can't wait to return for more pizza!  Who knows, I might even have a drink while waiting!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area. Been here twice already and phoned in pick up orders both times. Ordered pizza and the roasted garlic buns! Both were still good and hot when I got home! The pizza is good but not the best pizza I've ever had, but that's probably because I prefer my crust thinner. The roasted garlic buns were amazing though, my daughter preferred to eat more of it than the pizza. Since this is in a bar, you obviously cannot bring children BUT I've called when I arrived and asked them to bring my order out to my car because I had my daughter with me the last time and promptly brought it out! So thank you for doing that!!"}
{"text":"We asked how long it would take for a half sheet sausage pizza when we walked in. We were told 15-20 minutes which is not a problem. Well first it took an hour and 15 minutes, and somehow they burned the pizza to the point where it is inedible.  We will stick to the one on Arville"}
{"text":"Be prepared to get stuck waiting in a smokey bar because every time I order ahead and get there per my pick up time they haven't even started cooking my order and I have to sit in the bar for half an hour.  It's a shame because I like the pizza but it's just becoming not even worth it. You think if you are spending $50 on 2 pizzas and give them 45 mins to make it you wouldn't have to wait 30 more mins on top of that. And this has happened to me 3 for 3 times at different locations. I'm done."}
{"text":"My order delivered was wrong, they don't even bother reading the notes for the order, and the pizza looked gross with hardly any cheese. This location is not like the naked city pizza at moondoggies. Very disappointed in this Express location. Save yourself the time and go to the original location off of Arville."}
{"text":"I come from Western New York the same area as the owners of naked city pizza, my brother has lived here in Vegas for 20 years and said when you get here you have to try naked city pizza on Arville because  it reminded him of western New York pizza, and of course their wings buffalo style because they're from Buffalo and they know their wings. Just to throw this in I owned three pizzerias in western New York myself for many years so I do know what I'm talking about. I'll make it fast and simple the dough used to make my pizza was called Dead dough , or garbage dough which makes the pizza not rise because the yeast is dead the pizza was terrible and I asked for extra sauce on my double orders of wings and they came  practically dry along with cold french fries. The order was 20 minutes late for my pick up and that is happened multiple times, and they raised the prices without even telling you or  changing the menu or website. I love naked city pizza on Arville but blue diamond needs some attention. I personally don't like food establishments that are hit or miss"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and finally decided to give in and check it out.  It's located inside the Blue Diamond Saloon which is a great spot.  We came and got the suicide wings and the suicide fries.  Both were great and very tasty assuming you can handle heat.  The wings are probably the best in Vegas.  We will be back to try the pizza as the people next to us we're raving on about it..."}
{"text":"The pizza is amaaaazing. A half sheet is huge and the garlic knots are the best I've found."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here. This is not anywhere close to the actual Naked City pizzas. Pizza was cold, doughy, bland. I've have better frozen pizza. The wings were decent. 

Also there was barely any pepperoni on the pizza."}
{"text":"Second time ordering via UberEATS, last night. It came much quicker than anticipated! First time we got a half sheet of the guinea, and wings, and everything was great, though the wings were a smidge dry. We didn't finish them, though they looked really good. Oh well, it happens. We devoured the pizza, it was perfect. Last nights delivery was two 1/4 sheets (guinea and back home) with their garlic knot/bun/whatever they call it appetizer. Those buns were so delicious! Bigger than expected, with a perfect cheese pull. The pizzas were also delicious, unfortunately a little burnt though. Still edible! Just a a little black around the edges. Again, these things happen. Will definitely be regular customers from here on out. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got The Rebel to go. Yes it takes a while to make your pie but it's worth it. Just as good as the original location on Arville. Looking forward to frequenting this establishment often now that it's in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after hearing from a friend that their pizza was really good and ordered two slices to go for my son and I (one pepperoni and one slice of the day). Only the slice of the day was ready but he said he would make me a fresh slice of pepperoni and it would take about 10 minutes. Not only were both slices hot and delicious but the flavors and crust were soooo good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The guinea pie we ordered had literally half the toppings as the one ordered at the Arville location and tasted rather bland. The bar atmosphere is similar and the drinks were ordered with ease; however I won't be coming back because of the pizza. I honestly think they used 3 meatballs sliced up for the whole pizza (1/2 sheet). There were several slices with no meat on them at all. Save your money and go to the other location if you want good pizza."}
{"text":"Good quality ingredients, the Guinea Pie is incredible! Very filling and appreciated the fast, friendly service. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a location close to my house.  The crust is more like a loaf of Italian bread than pizza crust. Top it with their white sauce and any toppings and you are in heaven"}
{"text":"Just opened today and we where so ready!!we have driven to the two other locations and they where not in the best areas but by far our favorite pizza. We got the 1/2 sheet and large fries and it was more then plenty for our family of 5.

I was the first review and we where so excited but the service is bad and a few times the pizza has not been done and the last time the fries where not done. I wrote a PM on yelp to tell them i didn't wanna re review with no reply."}
{"text":"This pizza is INSANE. Might be my new favorite place. I can definitely see how it won the \"Best Pizza in Vegas\" bracket! 

Ordered Naked City from UberEATS last night and so happy I did! Let's start with how ridiculously delicious the pizza is. It's the perfect level of thick crust- soft and fluffy. The sauce has an awesome level of spice and is flavorful. I added the roasted garlic crust for kicks, and OMG. It was like eating pizza combined with garlic bread. So good. I gave a special order; it was delivered accurately and on time. I think they also upgraded me to a full-size (huge) pizza for no additional charge! Thanks! 

Seriously, everyone should try this place. These guys seem to go the extra mile to take pizza from generally tasty to absolutely fantastic. That's not something you can find anywhere, especially at a bar location. Can't wait to eat again...and again!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 times from here online. 1st time on  Postmates and the 2nd Eat24. Both times I go in to pick it up and they tell me they never got the order. Tried calling. No answer. Terrible service...too bad because the pizza smells and looks awesome but I will never know.
They don't care about your business."}
{"text":"Placed my order through Uber eats.. the photos of the food def fool you. Not sure if they treat take out differently than eating in but felt the cost exceeded the value and base on a limited selection of items, NCP will not get a second round from me or my family."}
{"text":"Update: the owner of this restaurant called me immediately after I posted this comment. He was appalled and upset at the behavior of the employee I described. This was not a manager I spoke with apparently. He offered to make restitution for the experience and wanted me know that that the crew would spoken to about the issue. This is more like the Naked City brand I know. Also the outside the smaller portion salad and only serving half-sheets the food was pretty good. I look forward to trying it again!


Worst experience with this Naked City. Gives the brand a serious bad name! Never coming back or ordering 

I was able to contact the manager of the store to detail the issue with the food. the gentleman was extremely rude and inconsiderate about the issues. The pizza was uncut and the manager suggested that I get in the kitchen and use a knife to cut the pizza myself. his excuse was that they were too busy. So I mentioned the salad being extremely small and he said that they are meant to be small and that they are an express place that doesn't serve restaurant portions. This has ruined my overall experience with my first UNER EATS experience."}
{"text":"Wow, it's hard to support a local business when its staff is so rude. I called to ask a question and had one of the worst customer service experiences ever. I've never eaten here and after a 1 minute phone call with this location, I never will. It's a shame. I always prefer to support local businesses."}
