{"text":"I ordered a lamb roast plate , the plate comes with rice which was Ok roasted potato which was bland salad and garlic spread is good and hummus that has nothing to the humus . the lamb was well done but bland no test the service was ok with me but I see the owner wasn't nice with another customer"}
{"text":"My son and I were looking for a restaurant in walking distance from the truck stop. We ordered the beef shawarma plate. The portions were very generous. Although the potato wedges were a little under cooked, they were tasty, and the entire meal was delicious. The price was very good considering the amount of food in the meal.  I know where to go next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One star for failing to deliver an authentic shawarma.My so called shawarma turned out more so like a wrap that I could probably find at any pita shop. I wanted mine to have succulent meats and veggies. Unfortunately this place falied to provide. There are MANY shawarma places in Toronto; however, this isn't one of them IMHO. You can find much better for more reasonable prices and great shawarma taste. My hunt for my next shawarma continues!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Shawarma sandwich which was a good size and tasted pretty good. I also ordered the Tabbouleh. The meat and sauces are very good and have a very pleasant flavour and aroma. They also have quite a few fresh condiments to choose from which was great. The tabbouleh was freshly made but boring as hell... All it was is chopped parsley, chopped red cabbage, maybe 2 pieces of sliced tomato, good amount of salt, tiny bit of lemon juice and maybe some olive oil.  All in all I would go back for the Shawarma sandwich or Shawarma plate but I will not get the Tabbouleh again unless they make it the way it should be made."}
{"text":"They make pretty good shawarma.
However, their customer service is terrible and requires a lot of improvement. Especially because of one lady who is always unhappy and rude towards customers. I am an occasional customer, but the attitude at that place makes me go to other places to get lunch."}
{"text":"It was overall meh. I feel like there was too much happening on the chicken shawarma plate. This chicken was okay at best, and the sauces seemed way too sour for my tastes. It was okay for a quick fix but I wouldn't say satisfying. Not too mention over $12..."}
