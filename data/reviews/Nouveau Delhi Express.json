{"text":"Tres bonne nouriture. Souvent nous le commandons par telephone et allons le chercher.   Avons mange quelques fois sur place. Deco sympathique. Sieges moins confortables avec les coussins. Mais la nourriture vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is excellent. Have been more than a dozen times and looking forward to go again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. They will make cheap replacements without warning you. American cheese has no place in Indian food instead of accepting their mistake they made the same dish again using American cheese again except cut up smaller to try to hide it. Then refused to refund when I decided I didn't want it."}
{"text":"J'étais un habitué de ce Resto sur la rue St.-Denis.  Je n'ai pas aimé mon repas.  Il y a tellement de bons choix dans l'ouest de Montréal....  J'irai ailleurs...."}
{"text":"Cela faisait quelques années que je n'avais pas mis les pieds au Nouveau Delhi Express. Hmmm et bien je suis un peu déçu, les plats sont ordinaires pour de la cuisine indienne et le service un peu expéditif...ma plus grande déception les épinards, je les trouvais très fades..le poulet tikka était bon mais un peu sec...les coussins sont assez larges et confortables pour installer un petit chouchou de 4 mois. Cheers to that!"}
{"text":"Nouveau Delhi Express, was, no doubt, the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in Montreal. As a person who really, really loves Indian food (it is my soul food), I was incredibly disappointed.  To start off, the taste of the food was terrible. I went with my family, so we ordered a set (which had 3 main dishes, rice, naan, and a dessert), chicken biryani, vegetable korma, and a paratha. After the first bite, we all had frowns on our faces because literally everything was unbelievably sweet. The paratha was also really thick and crumbly, which is not what it's supposed to look like. The worst was the vegetable korma, which was so sweet it could've been dessert. I called the waiter and complained to him, to which he said it's the way people like it here in Quebec (which I really, highly doubt). He then said he'll add more spices, as though that's going to make the dish less sweet. He then brought the dish to the kitchen, it was obviously, still sweet when he brought it back. I still don't see how spices could've \"fixed\" the sweetness of that dish. That was the worst, but the rest of the dishes (like butter chicken and even naan) were very sweet. The vegetable korma was just at the extreme.  They brought the wrong order for my sister and when I asked them to replace it, the waiter said, \"This is good, you should try it,\" instead of apologising for his mistake. I had to firmly ask again for them to switch it to the right order. After all this very unprofessional service, the waiter still had the audacity to come up to us and ask us how the food was and tried to do small talk.   The entire experience was laughable now, but it was really unpleasant. I definitely will not recommend going here."}
{"text":"So I used to love coming here untill they opened up Taj Mahal down the street which is amazing.  I don't enjoy the cushions u sit on it brings ur legs right up to the table, I moved the cushion to sit on a hard wood bench covered in crumbs. I was in leggings so it was gross.   Butter chicken was super watery and not as good as I've had form there and I've ordered and been there a bunch of times.  I wouldn't recommend going there I think it's even cheaper down the street and 10 x better."}
{"text":"A good neighborhood Indian restaurant. Food is tasty, service and setting is nice."}
{"text":"Products are good but preparation and service is so slowwwww... don't trust the indicative time they d give you if you ask, add 50% to it."}
{"text":"This is A-OK Indian food in Verdun. They have quick delivery and the food is ok. Of course I have tasted better, but that would mean that I would need to go to Parc Extension or Downtown to get better stuff. If you live in Verdun, this is a good place to order your take out or delivery from.  I have not actually sat in the restaurant, but I have walked by it, and it seems ok."}
{"text":"J ai vraiment aimé !!!!"}
{"text":"Have ordered from them a number of times and haven't been disappointed. Value-wise it's weaker but my experiences have all been group ordering in bulk where it comes out to $20pp and we're all full, or through JustEat with their delivery discount that makes it a $50 (after tax/tip/delivery) for 2 people to gorge and there still be left overs. That being said, their regular menu prices are steep considering they only include 1 meat and 1 side whereas I can get a thali plate from most places (meat, veg, nan, rice, papadam, salad) for the same price if not cheaper."}
{"text":"Ordered a take away twice.  The pizzas were extremely delicious. The smoky flavour of the tandoori meats was delightful. Indian food however was mediocre. Nothing for which you might want to make a special visit since it's not cheap either."}
{"text":"Bon resto indien, bon rapport qualité / prix !"}
{"text":"Ordered online.  The man ordered a butter chicken with rice, and I ordered a chicken Korma with naan.   The naan was absolutely delicious. I honestly wish I had ordered another.   The chicken Korma was sweet, a nice thick sauce, and they didn't cheap out on the chicken.  The butter chicken had a great flavor to it, but I personally prefer a little bit of a thicker sauce.   I think all in all this place is really good. I just wish for the price, they had offered either complementary naan or a samosa or something."}
{"text":"Bouffe correct, jolie ambiance, bon service, bien aéré, repas pour emporter aussi. Pain Naan mmmmmmmm :)"}
