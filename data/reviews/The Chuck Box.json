{"text":"One of the best non-commercialized burgers I've ever had. Thickness is good, diameter of the patties are large, and they're nice and juicy too. Definitely recommend this place if you want an excellent home-cooked burger. Fries were great too."}
{"text":"I am fir the idea that the chuck box is a great restaurant . Firstly in my opinion , it ia cheep . For example , the meal is $13 , so you can you can buy more than one . Also I think the waiters are friendly and funny . In addition , its is near the university and the downtown area , thats why students eat from it in the break . Finally I strongly believe that the main thing that makes me loce the restaurant is that they sells delicious meat and chicken . In summary all of these reasons let me love to eat this restaurant that let me guve it five stars ."}
{"text":"This place is legendary. I am somewhat of a burger coinsure, and I have not found a cooler place with better food yet. This place has been here for a long time, so obviously its  good. Its old fashion yes, but whats wrong with that? And who doesn't like to put their own toppings on, come on! Its very western looking inside, and they have beer. I have no complaints and Ive been going there for about 10 years."}
{"text":"Flame grilled burgers, build your own veggies and sauces and throw in a beer. AWESOME burger place."}
{"text":"great hamburger, Juan is one cool dude, I've been eating there for years, one tip get there about 11:AM for lunch to avoid a long wait, but even if there is a line it's worth it, it moves fast."}
{"text":"So, this was my first time visiting this spot after living in the neighborhood for 2.5 years. I was at a beer festival in downtown Phoenix and really wanted a hearty burger after all of that drinking and light railing it. Since, I run a huge Meetup group that prides itself on supporting local establishments throughout the Valley I decided to check out the Chuck Box to feed my beer filled, yet starving stomach. 

I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with Swiss Cheese. I am used to Swiss cheese having the wholes in it, but this one did not. I was a little nervous to eat it, but I did, and I am still a live. I am a major foodie and know when things are of great quality, etc. 

Moving on, the burger was damn tasty, in fact kind of hair blowing.  The condiment bar looked a little shady, but once again, I am alive and did not get food poison. The Bacon Cheeseburger came out to be a little over $6.00 just by itself, which to me is kind of pricey for what you get. 

The ambiance is not appealing on the inside, but the outdoor seating looks to be a little nicer. I am happy to have visited this spot, but will not return.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Went to Chuck Box after hearing about how awesome the hamburgers were. I really liked the burger and fries(which were awesome) except for the seating area. I would say that they may want to find someone to keep an eye on the tables for cleaning as we had to wipe down our tables with napkins. Not that I am above cleaning but I do enough of that at my house and going out to eat is to get away from all that. So food wise, great, but if I do go again, I may just do take out."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall you'll want to frequent. As a pescetarian, I order the garden burger, and due to the \"do it yourself\" bar of condiments, I can never go wrong. My boyfriend is a man's man, so he gets the real deal... and we continue to frequent Chuck for a very good reason. So do many others considering the consistent long line regardless of the often long wait ... made to order takes time, kids. I don't recommend the fried zucchini, however, just because it was a bit too cheap tasting and put together. Opt for a different side or create that ranch/hot sauce combo to make anything amazing. One last note, the guac is the consistency of \"baby poop\" I've been told. We did recommend that they switch the current guac out with a chunkier version. Then again, you might like your guac to have the consistency of mayo. Up to you. At the end of the day, this is a great joint for lunch if you're in the ASU area and looking for a cheap, tasty burger. (They also serve chicken)."}
{"text":"Heckled for not having cash. It's 2017! Not sure of why a seemingly established free-standing restaurant only deals in cash. (Hmmmmm...?) Rude dudes behind the line (cooking line). Not very nice. Did not order a thing. Will never return."}
{"text":"Cheap, endless condiments, sitting on wooden crates, smelling like open flame cooked burgers after you leave, the old burlap sacks lining the ceiling, the televisions...

This is a dude establishment. But it's delicious, so it's ok! They even have veggie burgers, but you might be made fun of for ordering one when you could get the huge burger with grilled peppers and bacon on it. Manly!

Real men pay in cash or they don't get food at all."}
{"text":"Burgers done on a grill with a toppings bar.  It was, I believe, cash only at the time I went.  It was very delicious."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick, filling, simple burger near campus? This is the place! 
The best part about this place is that their menu is simple and ordering is really easy. You just tell the guy at the front of the line what you want and he starts making your food. You grab your own drink and after you pay there's an area of toppings so you can put on as much extra stuff as you want. 

I've been coming here since I was a freshman at ASU living in Hassy (freshman dorms on campus) and it hasn't changed at all and is still pretty good. I definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area who wants a simple, delicious burger."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger joint around!!! Great service bomb food affordable price you can't go wrong really. Everything here is great I come here with my son and husband all the time great setting even for families!"}
{"text":"The Chuck Box will always have a spot in my heart. As an ASU student in the late '90's it was my go to burger joint on the edge of campus. On a recent visit to Tempe, I was delighted to learn that the place has not changed one bit. It is my all-time favorite burger. These are large fire grilled burgers or chicken, choice of cheese, just stand and watch as your burger grills right in front of you. The dressings come on the bar so you make it to your own taste. It doesn't get any better than this for me. My must visit spot in Tempe, AZ. Love, love, love the Chuck Box. Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is pretty pricy for burgers, but it's a piece of Tempe history. It has been around for decades and you are not a true Tempe resident until you have come here. It offers something different with the assembly line style burger customization. The food tastes delicious and the atmosphere is rather pleasant considering it is esentially fast food. Check it out for sure... p.s. my girlfriend wanted me to include that they really hook it up with lots of guacamole (a definite plus)."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, do not go there with babies and or little kids. The smoke is overwhelming."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town? Yeah, probably! The Chuck Box has consistently good burgers! I always get a 1/3lb or 1/2 burger and I love that there's a condiment bar so you get to dress your burger to your liking! The only downside is that it's cash only but I suppose you get to make demands like that when you're a staple restaurant!"}
{"text":"Chuck box have average price for all people. ASU students can visit chuck box every day. The cheeseburge price is $5. You can add fee any vegetables. The sorbet price is $2. The french fries price is $3. There is special offer any meal by $9."}
{"text":"We were over in Tempe today and it was lunch time.  My wife told me about aplace for a burger that  she used to go to when she was going to school over there.  She built it up a lot so I aid lets go.  Well this time the hype was justified.  One of the  best burgers I have had in recent memory.  We also had the onion rings.  Also worth the trip.  We talked to the cook and he said he had been there for 35 years.  His expertise shows.  I would drive twice as far for a burger that good."}
{"text":"The best burger. They grill them over mesquite in front of your face. Perfect every time. I've been coming here for years. The burgers are awesome."}
{"text":"This place has the best real-deal-this-aint-no-sissy-gourmet burger ive ever had. Its a lofty claim I know, but they can back it up. They also happen to have the fried zucchini that set the bar from which i now judge all other fried zucchini. This joint is no frills and dont expect a hug from the staff but the burger is legit. Definitely put this on your to-eat list yelpers."}
{"text":"Like having a backyard-grilled burger. It's good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Whats worse: an ex-con burger flipper who actually barks at you for your order, a filthy condiment bar, cash only, a cashier that walks up and asks you for your drink order and then walks across the restaurant as he goes and clears a table after he just asked you a question, or the fact that if you don't have cash you get to pay an extra $4 on top of your $5-7 burger to use their cute little ATM machine.

I KNOW: the fact that for some reason people completely overlook it all: \"If you go to ASU, you have to go to Chuck Box! So good dood.\"

I was in line, realized I had no cash and began to turn around to go to the ATM up the street. Spatula Master must have noticed that I was about to eff-up his patty streak before his next Skoal break, and shot me that \"I'll put 50 wounds into your torso with this Bic pen\" look, to which I respond: \"I'll be right back\" 
And the response I get: \"OOOK? Whatever!\"

Really? :-O

I would have left, but I was there with friends - damn.

They even have a sign posted claiming that they take cash only because they need to speed up the line. I got an idea: how about you employ more than TWO PEOPLE to service your entire restaurant. No? OK, waste my time and my money instead. I get you. Oh but, that can't be so, not if your website states:

\"Besides a cold beer and a burger, I'll be here to greet you with a smile and a hug.
- Big Juan\"

Big Juan must've gotten mugged by the two thugs working the grill at burger number 278. Poor Big Juan, I'd probably like this place if he was still around: I was able to make a pretty tasty burger out of a 1/3 lb. on wheat with pepper jack, jalapenos, and onion.

And no, this isn't what it means to be a Hole in the Wall; go up the street to Pollo Supremo: literally nothing but nice Mexican ladies serving you unique and very tasty food for a really good price. Yes they don't take cash, but they don't make excuses, and never would I expect to be greeted with that paint-peeling ex-con death-stare. And whats with the gimmicky Western decor? Hole in the Wall? The closest reason Chuck Box could be categorized Hole in the Wall: I'm afraid to eat here because if I piss off Spatula Master-Burger Nazi, he'll probably grab that red hot grill and flip it over on top of me... you gotta be mildly afraid to eat at a Hole in the Wall...

In all seriousness though, there's no excuse to treat paying customers like they're wasting your time. Maybe people don't know how to react, or they think that somehow its cool to go to Chuck Box and get treated like a roach. 
OOOK? Whatever!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this business. No parking. Very poor customer service. I got the big Juan and it was under cooked. The lettuce and tomatoes and extras were all very warm to the touch. Over all very over priced. 

I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Chuckbox, been going there for about 6 years, and I still have to maintain that its the BEST burgers I have ever had.  I also and slightly addicted to the fried zucchini.  Yep, its good.  Fresh cooked over an open flame right in front of you, pick your own toppings.  I will usually overestimate the size of my stomach and get a Great Big One, and eat it all. Then 20 mins later, need a nap. Come get the food its great.  PS i like to get a chili pepper on mine, so good."}
{"text":"Went to Chuckbox yesterday with my dad; hadn't been there since the early '90's when I was a student at ASU. I don't think ANYTHING has changed there; and that's a good thing! Still the worlds best burger! Although I can't handle a great big one as easily as I did back in the day! 
I went to Smash Burger for the first time a few weeks ago and it's mighty good. My dad and I decided we had to make a trek back to Chuckbox to decide who has the best burger. We both agreed it's pretty much a tie. Different tasting burgers. VERY different environments; both outstanding!
My dad's comment was that Smashburger tastes 'corporate' and Chuckbox tastes homemade. 
If I had guests from out of town we'd go to Chuckbox every time!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Charcoal grilled in front of you. Except for cheese you can choose your add ons after leaving the line. This was my first time here and I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers! good sized meat patty, toasted buns and smothered with extra cheese and bacon. You pay extra for the cheese and bacon but it is well worth it they don't skimp on anything!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to check out every once in a while (shouldn't be eating burgers every day anyway).  Food is cooked right in front of you and you can customize any way you want.  Pricing is fair for the quality of meat you're getting.  Their condiment bar has more options than anyone should ever need, but it definitely comes in handy.  You could be ordering the same burger 10 different times and get 10 different experiences out of it.   Very chill environment for the young people to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"My first experience, and I felt like crying when my burger was about to finish. It could be the best burger I've ever had in my entire life. I'm really sad that I'm leaving Tempe in a few days."}
{"text":"This place is literally right across the street from the ASU campus, so I came here quite regularly while I attended there. Every time I come back to visit Tempe, I have to make a stop here. The bacon cheeseburger was my personal favorite. After all, who doesn't love circular bacon? Everything is made right in front of you, it's a lot of fun to watch. One of the trademarks from the cooks is to yell 'FRIES\" if you order them. There's a condiment bar where you can put your own stuff on your burger. The Big One is also a popular choice. I loved the BBQ chicken sandwich as well. 

Burgers are very reasonably priced, everything is made to how you want it. They serve beer to wash everything down with as well. It is cash only, but they do have an ATM inside. Parking lot is a little small and it can get very crowded at lunch time. Best to go when ASU is not in session or on the weekends when students are too hungover to go for lunch. But if you're looking for any burgers not named McDonalds or In-N-Out, then this is absolutely the place"}
{"text":"I stopped eating beef in 1995 but recently introduced myself to burgers again. My first real chargrilled burger in 19 years was here. It was divine. Perfectly grilled, with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles and fry sauce (ketchup and mayo) on a wheat bun. Combo of shrooms and zucchini on the side. It's simple - but that's what makes it so great."}
{"text":"Really cool place. The cook was super nice and the vibe was relaxed. You basically make your own burger, which is always nice. Definitely recommend and the price was cheap."}
{"text":"I'm a very big fan of burgers and take them pretty seriously. This place seems promising but ends up falling short. 
My little sister loves this place because she is young and still prefers cheese burgers with boring toppings... like plain cheese and ketchup. The chuck box makes a good boring burger. They fall short of their topping options. The lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, ect. are subpar. I believe a good burger needs a good selection of fresh toppings. 

The don't appreciate the value of fresh burger fixings. They would greatly benefit from putting more effort in keeping the fixings fresh."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken sammy, put the cheddar cheese on cold at the end, can't vouch for anything else there."}
{"text":"Must eat more! Love this place! I've been going here for the last seven years! Only down side, the line is to long! But that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Located right next To Arizona State University, Chuck Box has gained a colt following amongst students (And for good reason). In the most convenient expressions: This place is the bee's knees... Simple, Fast, and fresh burgers over an open flame for the right price. A condiment bar,  perfect for personalizing your burger along with superb fries/onion rings makes this joint one of the finest burger spots in town. 
CASH ONLY* so don't whip out the plastic like a rookie. 
Only downside is that you feel like you're in an oven in the summer time, but in the winter it's nice and cozy so dress accordingly either way. I love you Chuck Box. 
Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.    
 -Cheers"}
{"text":"This place is a whole in the wall and had some good food! Its worth the experience and the nice thing is that it's at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is a Tempe classic. I love the simplicity of the place and they make great burgers. I always get a classic cheeseburger and their onion rings, which are perfectly crunchy. It can get really busy and seating/parking can be challenging but its worth it."}
{"text":"I love ChuckBox. The quality of the meat and the status it is the place to go in Tempe. 
My own real issue is how busy it is  all the time and the loud atmosphere other than that my burger and onion rings are always good and fresh!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly people and terrific atmosphere. The old picture of Reagan in a B movie with a gun tells you immediately that this place has character, and is not afraid to show it."}
{"text":"A couple of friends took me to the Chuck Box for lunch and as soon as we stepped through the doors, the employee across the counter barked at us for our orders. I tried to explain that I've never been there before and didn't know what I wanted but he   was very impatient, and quite frankly rude. We all just picked the first thing we saw just to make this guy stop asking. I would've understood (sorta...) if it was busy but there was absolutely no one in line behind us. When we got our burgers my friend and I were waiting at the cashier for our other friend to get his burger and pay (he was paying for all of ours since we didn't have cash and they accept nothing else.) The cashier asked me who was paying and I pointed behind me and said something to the effect of \"the guy waiting for his burger.\" The cashier shot back, \"There's a lot of guys behind you.\" Dude! It's not like I was trying to skip out on him or anything. I was waiting patiently at the cashiers office (again, with no one behind me) and my friend would be there as soon as his order was ready. It was a really uncomfortable experience and really, some of the worst service I've had. 
The food wasn't anything extraordinary. You put your own toppings on, which were your standard toppings. The fried zucchini were pretty good. The food definitely did not make up for the employees."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time.  You have to be a fan of wood fired grills if you are into burgers.  Since it is not my usual hangout, I always get the \"great big one\".  You put your own toppings on them after you \"check out\", so if you do not like certain toppings, it's your choice.  Two minor gripes would be, 1, it is cash only, 2, no free refills on drinks.  What few if any, eateries do not offer free refills?  This won't stop me from coming here, but it does make this place feel \"cheap\".  Parking is kind of hit and miss too.  Oh well, what do you expect from Tempe?"}
{"text":"I was reminded of a backyard BBQ burger. BUT 100 TIMES BETTER!!! The experience was so good! My first time yesterday & I plan to come back again & again. Great service. Great quality tasting food. Nothing like it. The French fries changed me. I definitely recommend The Chuck Box to anyone looking for lunch on any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was little.
I love the food and the ambiance.
it's a very small place but I love the condiment bar to allow you to have your food the way you want it. Fresh meat charbroiled goodness!"}
{"text":"The popularity of this place defies logic. The best explanation I can think of is the fact that it's been a staple of Tempe for about four decades. But the service is terrible and the burgers are mediocre.

The first time I went here, I thought it was just a bad night for the staff because I had heard such great things. I came here a second time and the staff was just as rude as before and the guy at the grill once again paid no mind to whose order belonged to whom, creating a cluster in the middle of the line of people waiting to get their food. 

The first time I went, my order was wrong. I had to wait another few minutes for the guy to fry the bacon. I assume this is because he gave the other bacon burger to someone else (I saw someone walk away with one just as my oder was supposed to be finishing) because he just doesn't pay attention to any of the customers. The second time I went, another person almost walked off with my food again, but I said that I thought that order belonged to me. Only then did the guy at the grill look up and nod in agreement. Thanks, guy.

Another review here described an employee as \"bark(ing)\" at him. That seems about right. The cashier is no better. He's curt and doesn't seem to care at all about the fact that there's a line of people who want to give him money. I almost handed him my credit card the second time I went, forgetting that the place is cash only. The cashier gave me a disgusted look and pointed at the cash only sign. I had the cash, but why couldn't I get a simple, \"Sorry, we don't accept cards\"? Instead, I get the silent treatment and a look that suggests he couldn't care less where I take my business. Message received.

Some people assume if the food is from an independently owned shop, then it's better. Chuck Box proves this is not true. At 40 years old, the establishment has not expanded, probably because there are better options everywhere else you go in Arizona. Even in Tempe, fastfood chains Smashburger and Five Guys both have better burgers. I'm not a big In-N-Out guy, but I'd definitely eat there over Chuck Box. I've even been to McDonald's restaurants with better service than what I've seen here.

If independently owned places are your thing, there are plenty of other options for you in Tempe. Obviously there's Four Peaks. I also recommend Mac's Broiler & Tap at McClintock and Guadalupe. They have a good burger and beer special you can take advantage of and their food is delicious."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious, hot burger with tasty sides, this is your place. It's rustic interior is charming. You get to watch your burger cook. It's not as fast as mcdonalds, but that's a good thing. It's quick and delicious. The fried zucchini were fantastic."}
{"text":"They make a pretty good burger, nothing out of the ordinary. Onion rings are very good, and the atmosphere is kind of cool."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers; like backyard bbq amazing!  ...and awesome fries, too.  Huge condiment bar -- but don't go if you're a germ freak or pay for everything in life with plastic:  This place isn't for you.  No fancy seating or bright lights -- it's tiny, you sit on old logs and there's usually a line -- but don't worry, it's worth the wait.  No \"product uniformity\" here, but who cares -- they're damn good!"}
{"text":"Charbroiled wonderfulness right at ASU. This place makes the best classic style charbroiled burger in town. Get in the line (it moves quickly), look up at the board to decide what you want, and be ready early because they'll ask you in order to get it started and move things along quickly. After you've paid you get to dress up you burger to your wishes at the full condiment bar. Good experience for kids too. So, bring your CASH and hope for a free parking spot in their own small lot (or pay across the street)."}
{"text":"A charcoal grilled burger and a pitcher of beer? Yes, please. The buns are just supermarket buns and the fries and onion rings are previously frozen, but I like this place a lot for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Friendly staff, nice old school look to it and fast service. Love this place! My friend brought me here to try out the burgers and have been hooked since!  If you are out in Tempe and want to try some great burgers and fries come to this place, trust me is worth it and the price is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Man this place is a dirty pit ran by ex-con's. the food is tasty but eat it at your own risk...."}
{"text":"My dad used to take us here all the time and now that im a student at asu I love coming here for the great memories and food, the veggie burger is great! No frills here and the fries could stand to be better but I will always love this place :)"}
{"text":"Loved this lil local dive!!  AMAZING burger and nice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get a burger in Tempe. This place pwns in and out and five guys. I usually get the big one, but have fucked around with the tijauno torpedo, as well as the great big one (too much meat for my taste). They also have great appetizers (mushrooms, and onion rings), but tend to avoid the fries. The wings here are unique, worth a try, but stick with the burgers."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the char grilled burgers here very much. The meat is fresh when placed on the grill. Once your burger is cooked, you put all the side on (as little or as much as you want). 

Fries are good, but not great.

Has a relaxed atmosphere. The place always is busy when I go or drive by."}
{"text":"If you like long waits and sweating your a$$ off then go here. I have no idea if the food is good, I left because I couldn't handle the heat.  No AC??!! Come on guys it is Phoenix. I get the \"we take cash only\", too cool for school mentality but why torture your patrons?"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best burgers in the entire Phoenix area. I love the fact that the burgers are fresh and grilled right in front of you on the giant wood grill. The flavor that the grill adds is excellent! The decor is simple and to the point with a very rustic feel. The staff is friendly and they have a giant \"build your own\" salad and toppings bar. If I had to nit pick one thing it would be that the fries are just OK. Just keep in mind that it is cash only. So if you are looking for a good fresh burger, check out Chuck Box."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers that will leave you wanting to come back! Juicy, charbroiled goodness that melts in your mouth. The onion rings are fresh and some of the best i have ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of the classic burger joints in Phoenix. Just walk up to the grill and place your order. The Big One is the standard but get the The Great Big One if you're really hungry. Slide on over to the left and grab a drink. Then just be patient and they'll have your burger ready in a minute. Slide over to the left again and you can grab a fry. Then time to pay--cash only, mind you. Now the beauty of the process is the condiments bar. You can make as simple or complex of a burger as you want. Nothin fancy, just a burger done exceptionally well.

I miss the second location they had in Scottsdale on Scottsdale and Shea. An Oreganos replaced it years ago and I still hold an irrational grudge against that establishment."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to the Phoenix Zoo (28 miles) we look forward to feeding our faces at the Chuck Box. Sure it's a little different with ordering also with the same rustic atmosphere from the first day they opened. Whats great you can see your food being cooked in front of you. Nostalgic for a 1973 ASU Alumni we've been going there since it opened and nothing's changed. Which is great for us.
They have the best barbecued hamburger, actually all the food there is great. Lov it.
The line can be long but they get you thru it quickly, bring CASH to save you the chance of having to use the ATM machine. 
I don't mind the cash part especially when the food is good also having the rustic atmosphere makes it pleasant."}
{"text":"I love the Chuckbox.  Juan, great tasty burgers, great ASU Co-Eds, condiment bar, onion rings, etc etc etc.

I have never had a bad experience there.  When working off of Priest a few years back, a group of us would go weekly.  Can't miss."}
{"text":"Best burger around. This is like grilling at home but without the work! Try the torpedo!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The only down side is they charge for water, or at least they charged us when we got water and we told the guy we got water. Overall, food is awesome, environment is awesome, the little burger bar where you can decorate your burger is awesome. Keep it up guys. :) Get the half n' half on the fried mushrooms and zucchini, yum! I also love the prices for everything."}
{"text":"First time having this place & they were great! It was at least a 15 minute wait for my chicken breast to be done but I'd rather have it cooked than to get sick from it. Plus the chefs were friendly"}
{"text":"Food was great! I don't normally review but I had a not so great experience the cook Anthony was very rude to my family and it just ruined our whole experience the cashier Mike was nice and tried making everything better for us. Overall food made up for it though..."}
{"text":"One word:  Awesome!!
If you've never ate  a burger at the Chuck Box, then you haven't really had the best burger ever made, period....

Its a must for me to eat here once more before I leave  Az."}
{"text":"This is a traditional stop with my Daddy on my way into town for a visit. Tucked into its spot on ASU's campus, you could totally pass up this place if not for the heavenly smells and the crowd lined up out the door. The cooked to order burgers, chicken and sides are heaven on an open flame. Great toppings bar and a cold beer to boot, this is a great value for the money. Be sure to bring your money too. Cash money, no exceptions and there is an ATM inside. 

Get there ASAP."}
{"text":"You have probably driven past this joint a dozen times without even thinking about it.  Next time, make the stop.

The Mustache loves a good greasy spoon, and this is a prime example.  It's a tiny shack with a charcoal fire roaring at one end.  A condiment counter sits in the center of an eating area that is little more than boxes turned sideways for sitting, and tables left with \"gifts\" from the folks who sat there previously.  You see, the place gets so busy with seats at such a premium that there isn't time for staff to clean tables in between when folks leave and you sit down.

The burgers are juicy and flavorful, with that \"dusty\" charcoal flavor incorporated within them.  The buns are thick and over-the-counter, probably Aunt Hattie's or similar.  Fries are tasty and thrown at you piping hot.  There are also options like fried zucchini or fried mushrooms, but who wants vegetables?!

This brings up a pair of side points...vegetarian options are a no-go here.  There are plenty of places in Tempe that will offer vegetarian or vegan meals, this should not be seen as one of them.  In related health news, the smoke from the charcoal pit frequently overwhelms the smoke-ejection system and backs up into the restaurant itself.  If you have respiratory problems or are otherwise fearful of breathing in occasionally-thick barbecue smoke, you can choose outdoor eating or just take your food to go.  A member of my party reported stinging eyes from the smoke, though to me it just felt like a fun backyard barbecue with all of the smoky aromas included.

The ordering process is old-school.  You enter and immediately form a line to your right, which snakes in front of the cooking area.  Your order is shouted at whomever is behind the counter, he in turn shouts it to the cook, who shouts something back to him, he then shouts to you to walk to the register and stop holding up the line.  Yeah, it's a bit daunting for a newbie.  All the shouting and confusion take you back to your first baseball practice as a child.

You'll quickly snap out of it at the register, where you'll pay in cash and then go about the business of finding a seat.  At lunchtime, this is a very difficult task.  Note that seats by the door offer you better ventilation from the aforementioned smoke problem, but will crowd you with folks lining up to order their food.  Condiments are sitting at a central counter, you can load up on them to your palate's delight.

Fifteen minutes later you are fat and happy, and your arteries are begging for mercy.  But that's what a good burger joint is all about, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Pretty solid burger, cash only. I think it is slightly overrated because it seems to have a cult like status in Tempe while they are pretty good burgers, I don't think they are as good as their rep."}
{"text":"This place is an ASU and Tempe tradition.  Cash only.  The burgers are good and you get to see them grill your burger and toast the buns inside the shop.  Awesome atmosphere and friendly service.  If your around ASU check out the Chuck Box."}
{"text":"I don't normally give five stars. But this place deserves it. Best burger ever. Draft root beer was delicious too. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Cool place, found it by accident was driving down the street and was hit with this hickory smoke coming from this little joint and pulled in and have been going ever since. Burgers are always good, price is great and the poppers are always crispy."}
{"text":"Excellent! Best burger in Tempe. Bring cash, no credit cards here. Fast, delicious and fresh"}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint.  A must when visiting ASU."}
{"text":"Was told about this place when I worked in Tempe.  Everyone raved about it.  Went and felt like I was at a Fudruckers.   Was overall disappointed in my experience.  Burger was ok.  Maybe just an off day?"}
{"text":"Three stars all for the burgers. Reminiscent of the original Dairy Queen (from 20+ years ago). Flame broiled burgers. Just plain good. None of the fried sides are necessary. Go big with your burger and pile on the condiments from the craaaaaaaaaazy salad bar!  Side note- the chairs are just wooden crates."}
{"text":"Of all the burger places in town, this is one of the best ones, if not the best one.  It is usually packed.  The burgers are always cooked consistently.  The best thing about this place is the toppings bar, you can make it exactly how you want it."}
{"text":"I used to eat at the Chuckbox when I went to school at ASU and loved it. Years later and after living in Texas and California, I still haven't found a burger that compares to it.

That is, as long as you accept it for what it is: a straight, non-fancy-pants burger on a charcoal grill. The way a burger should be. If you want a fauxbe-beef burger with truffle oil and scallions, you're in the wrong place. If you're easily put off by being shouted at while you dilly-dally about what kind of cheese you want, you're also in the wrong place. 

And, while you while you wait for your burger by the grill, you can pass the time by trying to decipher the code of little swords and cups that identifies an order. It's pretty complex."}
{"text":"The buns were bought from a place like costco. The fixin bar was limited. The tomato was cold and therefore had no flavor. The meat tasted good."}
{"text":"What?! Are you freakin kidding me?! You never ate at The Chuck Box???!!!! They only take cash cuz they get so much business they don't need your stinkin' credit card!  They didn't spend money on comfortable seating cuz they know that your not going to give a f#@$ as soon as you start eating... Best burger!  Get the big one with bacon on it.  Oh yea this place is nice."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in the valley. Not a fancy diner so this was right up my alley.  They have a pretty good selections to choose from (beef - chicken) and assortment of deep fried foods, of course. I usually go for the double with american and onion rings. But their fried mushrooms and equally amazing. Bring cash. No CC accepted here."}
{"text":"Arguably the best, freshest burgers in town. Staff is always friendly and food is always good. Probably my only complaint is that it's pretty small inside- but hey, the small cozy wooden ambiance is what adds to the experience. Tastes like burgers at at back-yard BBQ."}
{"text":"5 stars if it weren't cash only.
Fantastic burgers, great onion rings.  This is my go to spot in Tempe."}
{"text":"Place is old and dingy with a unique historical feel but I'm not there for the atmosphere. Overall, one of the best burgers you can get in Tempe."}
{"text":"Good burger. Made to order right on the charcoal grill. You select your patty size and type of cheese.  Customize your own burger with basic condiments.  Add fries and a drink.

Customer service, nonexistent. The cashier didn't even say thank you when I handed him a tip.

The store itself was hot and muggy. It felt like it was hotter inside than outside, and outside was over 104 degrees!

Overall, a decent burger but not worth it."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall atmosphere. Cash only. Friendly and efficient staff. We had the torpedo and little along with fries and onion rings. Everything was delicious beyond my expectations. They cook on what looks like a sewer grate over charcoal. REAL beef; Not frozen patties! Self serve bar for all the condiments and fixins. The line moved fast despite the large crowd."}
{"text":"Being a pescetarian,  my options were extremely limited,  yet as you see, I gave this place 5 stars.  If any smell is gonna get me to eat meat after 5 years, it's the smell of Chux. No frills. All old school, making cheap food taste amazing. Doing a great job, Chux. Keep it up, & I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of burgers but I loved this place.
I like how MANLY this place seems to be, if you want some burgers cooked by some real men, this is where you go. The people who cook it seem like they just came out from prison, I love it. 
The only down side is that you have to have cash but with burgers like these, who cares?"}
{"text":"Great burger joint. Not a high class place more like a real low key burger place that cooks your burger in front of you with yummy sides. Has a condiment bar as well."}
{"text":"The time finally came to try Chuck Box. It was definitely worth the wait. First off, the burgers are the only credibility to this business. The rest (side orders) are average. Burgers are very good, and may taste unique in a way. I've tasted so many char-grilled burgers, I have lost count. However, CB's burgers are on top. Some times they over make fries and need to get rid of them. You will see one of the workers walking around offering customers fresh fries...like whaaaatttt? :)

Only downsides are this place only accepts CASH. Also, inside seating may be limited when busy."}
{"text":"this place has a couple of great things working for it:
- pretty original place with some character... sometimes hard to find around ASU...
- tasty burgers
- condiment bar
- simple ordering process
- decent seating indoors, even some outdoors for the few days of un-hellish heat.

for these same reasons, i think it's got a couple of things working against it:
- it's across the street from a college, and it's not college-kid prices for those of us that dont have daddy's dime.
- cash only is not very convenient when you need a bite between classes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast, and cheap! The burgers are freshly grilled at order. You can put whatever you want on it. The building is small, but has been there a while. Not a ton of seating inside, but lots of outdoor tables. Even if there is a line out the door, it does not take long! Fun place to go and visit. Definitely should go if you are a visitor!"}
{"text":"Chuck Box is awesome. Its cheap and the burgers and chicken are great.  Indoor and outdoor seating in a sort of log cabin/ farm house setting, cooked to order, condiment bar, very relaxed atmosphere.  If i lived close enough i would totally walk here hungover in PJs with my hair fro-ing to get some grub and feel totally fine about it.  Only down side is i dont think they serve alcohol, but who needs booze when you have heaven on a bun, huh?"}
{"text":"My favorite memory of the chuck box is watching a group come in and sit down at a table, getting huffy when no one brought them a menu. I wanted to tell them they need to go stand in line an order their food, but they looked like mean tempered stuck up snobs so I sat an enjoyed my mesquite charcoal grilled burger and watched them huff and puff about bad service before they got up and walked out. 

If you're a person that likes to be cuddled and kissed up to just because you ordered food, this isn't the place for you. 

If shouting your order to the order taker, over a crowd of people in line frightens you, this is not the place for you. 

If you somehow thought eating a chuck box burger would bring inner peace or some semblance of meaning to your pathetic life, this is not the place for you.

If you want a simple burger, cooked the way you cook it in your backyard or out camping, and you're not afraid to assemble your own toppings, and you're just as comfortable sitting on a wooden box as you're sitting on a stack of tires or a log, this place is for you."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Phoenix.Charcoal grilled and great fixin selections to suite individual taste.Beware...cash only!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burger and great service, do it yourself. Great lunch place before the Cactus Bowl.  Go Dawgs."}
{"text":"You're not really going to ASU unless you go to Chuck box at least once. It's as part of the campus as the MU or Gammage. The food is amazing, 100% delicious. I've had people recommend the veggie burger, the big one, the chicken, but i love love love the hotdog. I seriously can't get enough backdoor BBQ but in the winter that's incredibly difficult to come by. Unless you know about the Chuck box. If this place doesn't give you the warm fuzzy feeling of summer and the forth of July grilling, nothing will.

Beware, they only except cash, and the line is very difficult to get into from the east door. The seats are uncomfortable, the other customers are awful, and the busy times last for hours upon hours, but it's all worth it, I promise. I would wait three hours for a roller coaster, and I would wait four hours for the food at this place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I went to ASU and it was the best then and 10 years later they still have the best burgers in town!  Now I share it with my kids who love when we go there.  If you try all the chain burgers, then you are missing out by not trying the chuck box"}
{"text":"I almost always have the garden burger, which is not cooked on any meatless portion of the grill--but that's not what Chuckbox is about. At least they offer a garden burger. The jalapeno poppers and fries are great.

Once you grab your burger and drink, you pay, then head over to the fixin' bar.

Be aware that it's cash only, but if you forget, you pay the price at the onsite ATM."}
{"text":"Ever wonder why a place that doesn't have seafood has a warning that the food served may contain shellfish products? I do! Just a question to ponder while you what in a long line for a juicy burger at this no-frills eatery.  We showed up on a beautiful Friday, so of course there was a mad rush. Unfortunately, there was no free parking available, so I paid for parking across the street at the ASU lot.

After walking up to order a bacon burger and fries, we got lunch served on a paper plate, like you would at a family BBQ or picnic grill. Seriously, it's no frills. Then, you head over to the condiment bar to get your own lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, onion, etc. Just like if you were at a family BBQ. Noticing a trend?  Now, find a place to sit, but warning, it might be sticky!

On to the food: the burger was juicy, and had good flavor, but the bun was TERRIBLE. Grocery-store-white-bread-soggy-in-10-seconds, wait, the kind that you get at a family BBQ, bun.  Toppings were acceptable, not exceptional.  Fries were decent.  You gotta eat pretty fast before the sandwich falls apart.

Pros: juicy burger.
Cons: bad bun. 

Come here if you miss your family BBQ! And what is up with that food allergy warning?"}
{"text":"The Chuckbox brings to the table what is possibly the best burger in Tempe. If you take In-N-Out out of the picture, this burger is uncontested as the tastiest burger. They have a simple menu that consists of different sized meats, cheeses and different appetizers (such as fried mushrooms). Their burgers are freshly cooked in front of you and their fries are absolutely delicious. They have a toppings station where they have burger toppings as well as dipping sauces and condiments. Their seating is similar to that of a cabin (very cozy though). As far as service, I've always gotten exceptionally good service (except for one time around two years ago). Very friendly staff and very professional at what they do. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a really good burger in Tempe."}
{"text":"The best burger joint in the valley!
Double Big Juan w/cheese and a side of fries.
You will love this place."}
{"text":"I am for Chuck box  being a great place. First of all . In my opinion I Believe that chuck box is a great place for lunch and dinner , because a lot of families are happy when they are at chuck box second , the chuck box is off campus it's near to ASU. Third , the quality of service is good and staff at chuck box is so friendly . Finally , for there reasons I think chuck box is good place to eat . :)"}
{"text":"The absolute best burger in Arizona. When I was in college, I couldn't afford to eat here 3 times a week but I did because it was that good. If I am going to be anywhere near there I detour over for a burger. Love the Chuckbox!"}
{"text":"I'm sure glad I discovered this little bit of paradise.  Great chile; great wings; great burgers; and reasonable prices.  I'm taking my daughter there tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Food wise if you like burgers then these guys are a solid 5. Everything else 3. 

Went for the first time today with some co-workers. Long lunch crowd, not a fan of the guy taking orders yelling asking people in the long line for their order and I had to yell back before anyone actually got to the front, I had no idea what they offered and would have felt embarrassed if I hadn't been given a paper menu by a co-worker so I could order right away. 

The place was warm, humid, my seat was a wooden box that was planted to the ground sideways so I wasn't able to move my feet very easily with the small space under the table. I'm not a fan of self serve topping section, reminds me of a smaller less air conditioned Fuddruckers except they don't have Buffalo or ostrich burgers for me to try.  

They don't take cash...come on, why make people borrow from friends or pay an atm fee(my friend said their bank reimburses them). I'm curious if chuck box pockets the $2 charge in addition to saving the credit fees. They're clearly not hurting for business and they don't have a dollar menu so  just suck it up and pay the 15 cents for every $5 burger you sell for customer convince. 

I don't normally pay $5.50 for a burger (over $8 with fries and tax) but they're burger was very good, their fries were great too. 

There are many, MANY places to eat around ASU and if I feel like paying 8 bucks for lunch again I'll try more places I haven't been before I come here again."}
{"text":"The flame broiled burgers are awesome. There are no actual chairs to sit on, only wooden boxes. This of course adds to the western chuckbox theme and charm of the place. 

My only gripes are that there are no refills on drinks and there is a condiment bar that was pretty messy which led me to believe that it isn't attended to as frequently as it should be. Also, the condiment bar uses cheap picnic plastic ware that could easily fall into the product... Not very sanitary. Being that this place appears constantly busy, I'm sure it's not easy to keep the patrons from trashing it. 

Those are the only issues I had which would have otherwise netted The Chuck Box five stars.  I would still recommend this warm and homey little joint to my friends. :) 

Like I had stated: The food is awesome and the staff are friendly and accommodating. A definite place to go if you want a real burger done right!"}
{"text":"City of Tempe and its residents should be excited to have this place around! 

Awesome burgers and fries, wine or beer on tap, help-yourself condiments bar, chill atmosphere, indoor and outdoor seating, super affordable prices that are specifically designed for small budgets (college students), great service, etc.

The only con is that it's on cash only basis but they have an ATM machine inside."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and fries! But they don't accept credit so make sure you bring cash so you don't have to pay those stingy ATM fees!"}
{"text":"The Chuckbox is a good hole in the wall place to eat. Really good burger. It was my first time hear and they impressed me. It was a nice good cooked burger right over the grill and you could taste the freshness of the burger."}
{"text":"First dined here in 1973 as an ASU freshman. Nothing has really changed and never should. A throwback in time. Flame grilled burgers right in front of you, hot and crispy fries and an awesome fresh condiment bar. Bring cash, no credit cards. My fave is a Big One with cheese. Over 278 sold"}
{"text":"I love this place, but every time I go the service seems to get worse. I know the Chuckbox isn't known for its friendliness but  lately their servers seem to just be annoyed at their jobs. Twice I have clearly ordered BBQ chicken and I was given a buffalo sauce. It's fun to go once or twice but it's pretty expensive. Sometimes the condiments look ok, sometimes they look pretty gross."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised I forgot to review this place when I ate here some months ago.
I doubt anything has changed.
WOOD COAL flame grilled burgers made to order right in front of you, condiment bar, and beer available. It is unknown whether beer choices have improved over the standard yellow piss. Someone message me.

Rustic and dingy atmosphere, and spartan seating.
Please DO NOT be turned off by this.
You're here for an AUTHENTIC flame-grilled burger.
You top your burger how you want!
Order it medium.
Absolutely scrumptious burger.
Juicy.
Smokey.
TOTALLY REAL.
You can't get any more real.

THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.
Except CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Although I went to high school out in Tempe, I never attended ASU or went to this esteemed spot. Remember if you visit the Chuck Box, they only accept cash! Now if you're looking for an amazing char grilled burger, this is the hottest spot near Mill! The burger was tender and juicy, with the meat seared to perfection on the char set up! The size is hefty and it is cooked to perfection on the flame. As a burger afficionado, this was definitely up there as one of the best! Beware of the long lines and wait, but the food is totally worth it! The fries were awesome as well! I had friends driving through AZ from another state and they agreed that the burger was spectacular. Chuck Box you win! Just wished I visited this place sometime earlier in the last 10 years during my time in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This place is a Arizona Establishment. My dad would tell me stories of studying in the 70s here. 
We went back for burgers and he told me it hadn't changed a bit.

A few mentions:
#1 Cash only establishment.
#2 Open Bar condiments. 
#3 Know your order BEFORE you get into line.
#4 Nobody will ask you if you want it \"To-Go\". You do it when you order.
If you don't think you can handle those things. Don't come. You will hate it regardless of how amazing the food is. 

This is an old school- make it when you order it, cafeteria style (but quite clean), no frills, nobody holding your hand - burger joint. Burgers are big with no fillers. Staff will take no guff from you or apologize for your mistake. Condiments are fresh (their pickles are amazing!) Onion rings the best (Beer battered). Beers are cheap. Prices are low. Bus your own tables."}
{"text":"Love the concept and the back to basics nature, problem was the burgers had no flavor, everything was good, it just lacked the flavor, the beef didn't have it and the bacon didn't either. Fries and mushrooms were good and the burger as a whole was good, but lacking flavor and the congestion of people moving backward and forward in life made hinge difficult. 80/20 ratio would be a better tasting burger, will come back!"}
{"text":"Finally I have found a great hamburger place!! I suggest adding the green chili (adds flavor without the heat). If you are really hungry go for the 1/2 lb as you may still be hungry after with the 1/3 lb. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday night. My first time. I have to admit, the burgers are among my top 5. Amazing!  I shall definitely be returning and am more than happy to recommend them."}
{"text":"I really like coming here, everything is always superb! The hamburgers are quite large, and the dressings they provide on the condiment table are very nice. The onion rings and fries are nice and crispy, and cooked to order, just like everything else. I love the toothpick system the hamburger chef has for knowing which cheeses and toppings to put with which patties. Trying to decipher it keeps me entertained while waiting in line.

Hot dogs are just okay, they slice them in half and grill them like burgers, even serve them on a burger bun! I usually just stick with the hamburger, even the lil one is enough for me."}
{"text":"I've been here many times as I used to work across the street from '78 - '84. The food was much better back then. Hadn't been in for quite awhile, so I came in on a Sunday at 10:40 am. It was fairly busy, and the wait standing in front of the grill is BS! They need to change their system. I had a double great big one with cheese, to go. Unfortunately my burger which I ordered medium rare was close to medium well. Totally brown, and on the dry side. I can make a better burger at home for the same $$ I paid here. I despise overcooked burgers, so I will not be returning as it is really nothing special in the first place."}
{"text":"Always delicious!! Definitely would recommend anyone to at least give it a try. Yummy. Also would recommend not \"over doing it\" with the condiments because the burger itself is flavorful"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in Tempe, cash only but worth every cent. I'd recommend adding the green chili to your meal."}
{"text":"I must be missing something... Just not my kind of place I guess.  Other than having close proximity to ASU, I have no idea how this place stays in business. Definitely, not a place to sit down comfortably (chairs are actually Woden crates sitting on their sides) and relax on your lunch hour. Extremely loud and everyone is fighting for a spot at the Condiment bar to add some sort of flavor to a low end meat burger. I've also had better fries at Wendy's and McD's...With Portillo's a mile and a half away, why would anyone go back here?"}
{"text":"This review will remain a 1-star until you quit being lazy and accept other, less antiquated forms of payment than cash. Get with the times."}
{"text":"This place rates stars for just being cool.  The building is small, dressed in plank wood like a shack.  Even the name is cool.  I love places like this, never daring to pretend they are something they're not.  It's a burger grill.  There are several tables in there but most of the room is dedicated to the big a** grill and the toppings bar.  Their line system is efficient since you fix up your own toppings and their menu is simple.  The service is friendly but not over-done.  Like the reviews here say, this is not a place for truffle oil, bacon jam or broccoli rabe.  It's just burgers lovingly crafted on a grill.  This is one of the places you take your co-worker from out of town to show them that one Arizona hole-in-the-wall which will make them envy you when they leave."}
{"text":"The food here at The Chuck Box is really good and delicious.The burgers here are delicious and so are the fries.And I love the history here about The Chuck Box"}
{"text":"This place is great. Wow. I love meat and burgers and hearty food. Got the bacon cheese burger and man was I impressed. The bacon was circular and flat instead of strips, it was a nice touch. Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Awesome!! I go to this place every time I'm in Tempe. It's a bbq indoors! Made to order chicken, burgers, or hotdogs. Laid back atmosphere but bring cash. They don't accept credit cards. Top your food the way you like with as much as you like."}
{"text":"What  a cool place... CASH ONLY but the prices are good and the burgers are fantastic!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint easily. I highly recommend their original burger the \"big one\" or their \"hot 'n' spicy chicken\". Everything I've had here has been delicious. The food is cooked over an open flame while you watch. The place is always packed, so I recommend going either for an early lunch or late lunch to avoid the crowd. Its cash only, so plan ahead and bring cash. There is an ATM, but there's an ATM fee, so its better to just bring cash.

update:
If you've never been, this place, GO. Its rustic/cowboy themed. You walk in, shout your order over a noisy crowd packed in the small building. Then watch your food get cooked over a wood burning fire. Once you pay (with cash), then you can pile on toppings at the self-serve toppings bar. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Also, there is beer on tap and free soda refills.

This is the ONE restaurant that I frequent that has never disappointed me, even in the slightest way."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Its a very basic burger and fry place. It can get backed up because of the way the line is set up and the soda machine is in a really poorly chosen spot. They only take cash which is kind of annoying.


Good burger

good fries

good onions rings"}
{"text":"A veritable Tempe establishment. Whenever I tell my dental hygienist I go to ASU, she asks me if I've been to the Chuckbox.

Sometimes, you just want a simple burger with no frills. No floofy brioche bun with sundried tomatoes and blah blah blah. The meat has great flavor from the charcoal and mesquite and you can get a 1/3 lb Big Juan and still have change from a 5.

And the condiment bar is fantastic. I can put tons of tomatoes just because I want to and there's lettuce, onions, and ranch dressing too so you can make your own little side salad. 

Now there's lots of other options by ASU like smashburger, five guys, fatburger, etc, but when I have a hankering for a good burger, Chuckbox is the place to go."}
{"text":"Don't want to wait for a waiter, then The Chuck Box is the place for you as long as you don't mind a line.  To order you queue up in a line by the front door where a gentleman will take your order from their simple, yet good menu hanging overhead. You then walk cafeteria style to the end of the grill where you pick up your tray of food and pay. This makes for a great in and out style of eating while getting higher quality food than take out.  From my experience I would say they have good burgers and fries.  I also love their chicken strips as long as they don't come back over done.  Last recommendation is the fried zucchini.  Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's probably obvious but this place is by no stretch healthy food so if you were looking for a healthy meal or a veg/special diet friendly place the Chop Shop next door might be a better bet. 

That being said this is by far my favorite burger place (and maybe restaurant) in town. The atmosphere is awesome: cooks shouting orders and smells from the grill right in front of you. Even the hungry patrons in line are in a great mood, we always seem to make friends with the people in line. Despite the rustic feel and run down look the place is always surprisingly clean and tables are cleared right away to make room for the piles of people that come in. 

Now the important part: the food. Burgers grilled right in front of you are all cooked the same way, to perfection. I highly recommend adding bacon (and cheese of course) to whatever burger you order. The fries are great and the onion rings are better. We usually get one of each and split. The burgers don't look that huge but they are very filling. 

Draft root beer and beer both come with mason jar mugs and are a great bonus to this guilty pleasure meal. You haven't really experienced the best of Tempe without coming to the Chuck Box!"}
{"text":"Awesome great burger!! I ordered a double cheeseburger and my wife had a single with melted cheddar cheese and it was off the chain!!! The bread was on point and all the fixings were available on a table after you order. My wife got the chili cheese fries that I wasn't too thrilled about because they had beans in the chili, so overall the service was great and a good time to go is after the lunch crowd. I will be back for more....this is the best burger I have had in years!"}
{"text":"The guy cooking was super friendly. The guy checking us out was so rude. Fries that were sitting on the counter before we got there was being served to us, when asked for fresh fries the guy said \"what am I going to give the guys behind you?\" I was shocked! The place had flies buzzing around and the burger had a diapery taste. Nasty place, I will never go back."}
{"text":"After hearing many good things I decided to stop by Chuck Box.

It lost points with me right when I walked in, \"Cash only\".  They have atms inside but they require a surcharge which annoys me.

I ordered the big juan (1/3 lb burger) with a side of onion rings.

While I was waiting for my food I noticed the topping bar, consisting of your typical burger toppings.  This is a nice plus because you can really have it how you want it.

I got my food fairly quick after watching them grill my burger in front of me.

After i got my cheeseburger, I put lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo and jalapenos.  I took my first bite and thought it was very good.  However my second bite I noticed it wasn't quite as good.  My third it was very average.  By my forth bite I was tired of it.  I don't know what it was but it just did not taste that special to me.  The meat itself just did not taste great.

Also the onion rings were very average.  Not bad but not sure if I would recommend them.

Overall my first experience at the Chuck Box was a bit of a disappointment.

I came in with people hyping this place up so much with one person even saying \"best burger ever eaten.\"

Maybe I came in with too high of expectations.  Maybe I just came in on a bad day.  Maybe its just not my place.

Overall Chuck Box was not bad, but I do not understand all the hype."}
{"text":"A   v  e  r  y   tasty burger!

Yes, at the chuck box I expected very little but got a different friday lunch experience, thats for sure. Yes, it is odd that one shouts ones order over a line of waiting patrons to the loud chef in the kitchen - but that just add to the experience.
 
Weird - a bit
Unorthodox - absolutely
Wrong - not at all

Then after joining the crowd of hungry, waiting customers I start to checking out the place. Red hot fire that the burgers all are braised over makes it kinda genuine in a way. A bar in the centre with all condiments and fixings, is up for grabs once the correct burger has been fetched and paid for. 

As I stated initially, I got myself a very tasty burger and a small serving of very tasty onion rings. It was Friday, so I'm allowed to.

I even liked the crates that substitutes for chairs and makes sure that as long as you are here, you are here to eat. There was a few things that could been improved, (and the ill manner isn't one of them) but overall I really enjoyed the chuck box and I will come back. Oh yes, I will come back."}
{"text":"The charcoal grill gave it such an amazing flavor! We got the Tijuana Torpedo with pepper jack cheese and whole green chilies. It's so fresh, and I love the toppings bar too. It makes it much more customizable. Cute atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"The condiments bar was fresh and delicious. The service was ok. The food was not bad. I actually enjoyed the chicken breast. The burger wasn't as great as hyped. It was ok. I think the expectation had been set so high that I left full, but disappointed. CASH only kind of sucked, I mean who does that anymore? I've definitely had better burgers and been to better restaurants within walking distance of this place. I don't know if I'll give it another try? Too many options nearby."}
{"text":"Best burger in Arizona, bar none. Unique setting as well, very plain and rustic."}
{"text":"A Tempe favorite for decades... My favorite burger is the Tijuana Torpedo but ALL of their burgers are awesome and are grilled while you wait. Cash only and please be ready to order when you get in line. Once you get your burger, you can go to the huge condiment bar and customize it how ever you want.
The Chuck Box  is a true Tempe institution and you will not be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Place is rustic and old,  not a bad thing since it is thematic of the restaurant itself. I have no problem with old but dirty is a different story. I must have come in before the annual mopping because the floor was... greasy. A burger and fries came out to be 7.68 or so, a drink would've pushed it to 10. For that money I could go to In n out and get a better burger, fries and drink for 2 people. While the wood fire grill is a unique touch, the burgers are thin and lacking.  I came here under the pretense that this place would have juicy, thick ground Chuck steak patties.  Not the case.  Fries sat under a heat lamp and were dry inside and out,  dusted in Salt.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"If your just looking for a GOOOOD BURGER then this is your spot. Nice selection of burgers to choose from. I took off one star because the place was a little warm in the summer but I really like all that smokey goodness. Its a must stop when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Made a stop here before the ASU U of A game on Saturday. 

Food was fine nothing over the top but very solid. They did a great job of keeping the line moving as there were a lot of people there picking up food before the game."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Kinda like being at a campfire type of a feel.  We always get the big one with the beer battered onion rings.  The onion rings are a must.  Forget the fries though (frys are just eh) and try fried zucchini instead."}
{"text":"The best burgers and chicken sandwiches you will ever eat. You can't make one of these burgers at home."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. I got the John Wayne with hot sauce and it was AMAZING! The hot sauce brings out the flavor without killing the taste with unnecessary heat. I did not order fries, but I did get a pitcher of beer. The beer was ice cold. 

For a person going there for the first time I would recommend looking at the menu ahead of time. They take orders really quick and you need to be ready to order almost right away. Expect a line, but it moves pretty quickly.  They have a toppings bar for your burgers or chicken sandwiches"}
{"text":"Saw this shack of a dilapidated-looking \"house\" and wondered what it was.  As I came closer, I saw what appeared to be outdoor tables with tree stumps as seating.  Went in and low and behold---a burger place.  Better yet, I could see some great looking burgers cooking on a fire grill. Even better yet, the wood fired grill uses mesquite wood!  We ordered two burgers with fries which were cooked perfectly (rare is hard to get as most restaurants are afraid to serve rare meat).  A condiments bar includes lettuce, tomato, jalapeños, pickles, sweet onions,as well as the usual toppings of mustard, ketchup, etc.  We topped our burgers and ate one of the most delicious burgers we have ever had.  The fries were perfectly fried (I asked for extra well done) and salted.  I can't tell you how great the burger was!   They are open 7 days a week which means... I will be there again soon.    
BTW:  This is a CASH ONLY place.  Fine by me."}
{"text":"As a former ASU Kid, this place was a staple in my diet. The smell is amazing and if you happen to study close by it can easily creep into your classroom. There's always a wait and it's sometimes difficult to get a seat but well worth it. The burgers are a make your own when it comes to condiments, may not seem too spectacular but wait until you bite into one of these mouth-watering gifts from heaven! Anything on the meu is good but two of my favorites are their fried zucchini and fried mushrooms, not the healthiest restaurant out there but well worth it for anyone visiting Tempe and ASU."}
{"text":"If your ever in Tempe Az this is a must. Cash only but awesome little hole in the wall restaurant."}
{"text":"If only the Board of Regents knew what a powerful incentive they had at their disposal in attracting students to Arizona's largest state university.

I like to say that the Chuckbox was one of the main reasons I went to ASU. Although I didn't mention it in my personal statement, the delicious smell of mesquite-grilled beef and chicken, sometimes wafting down University Drive as far as PV East, also certainly didn't discourage me from returning this year for law school. The Chuckbox has been an affordable, unhealthy indulgence for me for years. It's hard to go wrong with their sandwiches (except maybe with the veggie burger... but I've never tried it), but my favorites are the Guacamole Bacon Burger and the Tijuana Torpedo. In my opinion the fries and onion rings don't quite live up to the glory of the grilled items - I think they buy them frozen - but they're not bad either and I pretty much always order some anyway. Same goes for the fried zucchini: probably frozen, but delicious anyway with a burger.

I find the atmosphere - loud, a little smoky, definitely aptly described as a \"shack\" - perfectly complementary to the fare, but some might disagree. I've also developed a weird sort of respect for their cash-only policy... this Old-West burger joint doesn't give a damn about catering to the demands of twenty-first-century suburbanites for convenience and they don't have to (well, I guess they do have an ATM in the corner). But I can also see how many would see that as more of an inconvenience than a hip quirk.

If you're in the area, definitely stop by. In an area mostly dominated by chains and cheap, college-town blandness, the Chuckbox is a one-of-a-kind beacon."}
{"text":"Extremely rude people. Wouldn't give them your business. The very large man seems to be super unhappy and unkind to all. No matter how good food is, which its ok, I prefer to be treated kindly. I saw a woman trying to calm her crying baby in the parking lot. She was in a wrong space and he literally told her he didn't care and to move. There are plenty of places around here to go. Why go to a place with a man who stands outside, polices parking, and is grumpy to all?"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER around! Also, a fun little joint to sit with some friends and have lunch. Will be back again and again !"}
{"text":"This place is an institution... I used to come here back when I was a poor Sun Devil student.

They make the burgers right in front of you on a pulley-system charcoal grill.. and you can notice that in the flavor of the patty.  Plus, they make their patties in varying weight sizes (1/3#, 1/2#, etc) so you can get as much or as little as you want.  The very flattened patty is placed on the grill and I think this is perfect for cooking quickly and safely.. also, moisture is still maintained in the patty since it's not overcooked (what you do when you have thicker patties).

They have pretty typical greasy sides.. fries.. fried zucchini.. onion rings.. it's all good standard grease-stop fare.

I wouldn't at all say this is the cleanest-looking nor the most modern (cash only) or well-maintained burger joint.. but I will say that if you want a no-thrills damn tasty burger, you should give this place a shot.  

I went a couple of nights ago and it sure hasn't changed in the past 7 years... nor has it probably changed in the last 10 years :P  I did, though, really enjoy my 1/3# burger.. cooked to order, simple bun with onions, mayo and ketchup - delish!"}
{"text":"Brought a friend from out town here and it was a big hit.!This place has worked for so long because they do burgers and fries the right away...over a charcoal flame right in front of you. When you first walk in you can find the menu is above the grill area, and then you place your order with the person taking orders next to the grill. The menu is short and simple. ..so it shouldn't take long to figure it out.

 I got the standard burger with cheese, and fries. After paying, cash only, you go to the condiment bar and get the toppings you desire.  Rustic atmosphere and TV usually playing some sort of sports game in the corner.  I find the fries (not soggy, just the right amount if crispy)  and burger are  much better here then In and Out."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. This was an ASU staple back in the day but it's gone down hill. It's confusing trying to figure out where the line goes, the wait takes forever and it was very unclean inside. Tasted like typical fast food burgers and gave us all slight indigestion. Cash only. If you want a good burger go to In-n-Out on rural."}
{"text":"Its an ok place to eat.  My daughter loved her food.   I would come here again if I was in the area.  The burgers looked pretty amazing.

 Here's the thing....as we stood in line, they got the two people's order in front of us wrong.  They ended up cooking the burgers for the order for the two people behind me.  So those people ahead of me had to wait for the 6 orders behind me before their burgers were cooked.  Accidents happen but if they rush like this often, that's not a good thing.

Bring your own water.  I don't know if theirs is tap or filtered but if it is filtered, it needs to be changed/maybe have the machine cleaned."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, this restaurant has one of the best tasting grilled chicken sandwiches! I order the same thing pretty much every time - the regular grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese. Their topping bar is great too so you can help yourself. I typically get lettuce, tomato, onions, & mayonnaise. Their sides are good - my favorite is the onion rings but I've also tried the fries (sometimes a little salty), fried zucchini, & fried mushrooms. This restaurant also has delicious ranch dipping sauce which is one of my favorites for food like this. The line is almost always really long but well worth the wait. It's fun to watch them cook your food in front of you & they serve it cafeteria style. I will say however that a couple of times, when we've ordered our sides, they've gotten a bit cold or have been taken, especially since the wait is a bit longer for chicken to cook than the burgers. The prices are pretty reasonable & it's a great hang out place as well for groups."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of burgers, but this is always an exception. Each burger is made on the spot which means....you will get a freshly made burger to your desire. I enjoy \"the big one\" with grilled green chile and pepper jack cheese. Don't forget to get their fried zucchini and their ranch is delicious."}
{"text":"Yo Chuck box... No one likes your shitty burgers. Close down so we can bulldoze your restaurant and make a parking lot for better restaurants like The Original Chop Shop. Thanks."}
{"text":"How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?  Sorry.  I went there.  Couldn't resist.  

With that said, that stupid tongue twister is all I could think about inside the Chuck Box.  I certainly wasn't waxing poetic about the food.  I thought the burgers and chicken burgers here were OK, but just average.  The chicken burger with pepper jack was cooked just right, but nothing about it struck me as better than normal.

I've seen other burger joints with condiment bars, and was hoping for something distinctive, but no - just the typical average fixings.  The feel in here is very country or Midwestern with the wooden boxes as stools and burlap sack ceiling.  I dunno.  Can't really place it, but it's very laidback and unassuming here.  I like it, but The Chuck Box felt and tasted just average to me.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Note: do not bring first date here. 

This is a place for a well done burger. Nice people. Convenient location if your on campus. But it is not the prettiest of places."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I last visited this spot. I used to work a mile away so I would come almost three times a week that I became a regular. Sadly, I switched jobs so I never have the time to drive over to this area. I think after tonight I'm a have to change this habit. 

After eating this burger, I realized why it was one of my favorite burger joints before they started popping all over the valley. It's absolutely terrifying delicious. It's like the best backyard bbq burger! The meat is tender and flavorful! It soaks up the burning wood for that smokey taste. Great seasoning on the burger and that round patch of bacon is awesome. I'm a fan on the way the cheddar combines with the patty on the grill. 

Fries are delicious. Rings are greats. But the burger is what keeps you coming back for me. It's the key to this place. I miss Juan and the older faces because I see a bunch of young cats running the joint. Chuckbox will forever be my go-to spot when I'm being indecisive. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Remember, cash only folks! 

All hail O Great Big One"}
{"text":"This is the type of place that exists in practically every college town in the country and hopefully will continue for the foreseeable future. There's nothing fancy about The Chuck Box. They do burgers, chicken sandwich You come in, line up, and get ready to place your order because they don't wait until you're at the counter, instead you get to yell it across the entire restaurant and watch as they don't write anything down, but instead mark the buns with an intricate system of toothpicks, that might be the restaurant version of a semaphore code. Somehow it works though as everyone gets their order and the food is ready (or nearly ready) by the time you get to the front of the line. Also, even though it seems really busy, there's almost a table available once you have your food, although the system can be messed up by people who insist on sitting down while other members of their party get the food.

So next time you're on the ASU campus and you want a genuine college experience, go to The Chuck Box. Oh, and bring cash... they don't take any other form of payment."}
{"text":"The burgers aren't life-changing or super wonderful.  They are yummy and taste very homemade/real.  I did think the workers were very nice considering we aren't the normal clientele (parents and 5 kids including bratty toddler). I think part of their kindness stemmed from not wanting to hold up the line on a Friday night but anything works.  The root beer was so good!!! I don't like onion rings, but my husband is a connoisseur and he didn't like his."}
{"text":"Big burger that you put your own toppings on.  Pretty much have Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle.  No spread though.

So to make this review quick.

Big burger.  Onion rings and a coke.  12 bucks and change.   You got to be joking right.

Just go to IN-N-OUT and get a Double Double combo and it will be around 7 bucks and taste better.

Chuck Box.  More like Overpriced box."}
{"text":"Our group often pops by The Chuckbox when we are in Arizona for our annual Spring Training trip.  Great burgers, great price!

I hear the complaints about the ambiance, but I come for the burgers, so I don't really care about the decor."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Chuck Box, I felt like I had De Ja Vu. It seemed like it was exactly like the Original Hamburger Works in Phoenix. Were the same company? I still don't know! Either way, this is a decent place for a quick collegy burger lunch. I enjoy their bbq burgers, the smoky, backyard grill taste, and the cheap prices. However, I don't enjoy the staff and most everything else. Oh, and the clientele can be a little annoying too...as its across the street from ASU. (HAH). I'll give them one thing though-- I do still crave their fried mushrooms from time to time. If you're into this sort of place, I recommend Original Hamburger Works in downtown Phoenix-- less of a hassle, same exact menu, burgers, and condiments bar, but with far less attitude and an old fashioned cowboy bar."}
{"text":"The place is good. Think of it as going to your neighbor's BBQ. This place isn't gourmet, but who cares. It taste like normal food over the standard commercialized food, which is an awesome change of pace.

The only thing I'd change is the amount of food. I got a Guac cheeseburger and fries and went back for a little one... and STILL was hungry. Ha!"}
{"text":"This place is very small and only accepts cash! The burgers are really good! Fries are good too. I had the Tijuana Chile (something Tijuana) burger and it was really good! You get the burger, pick your drink if you want one, pick up your fries if you ordered some, and pay. After you pay you can go put condiments on your burger. It took me off guard that they use paper plates haha. But the burger was so good with oozing melted pepper jack cheese that I didn't care. I'd come here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I have to address the \"cash only\" complaints.  I've worked in the credit card processing industry, and the thing that most consumers don't know, is that when all is said and done, the business (if they're lucky) pays an average of $0.20 cents and 2.5% of the total charge to the credit card industry every time you use your credit card.  That means, that on a $5 burger, it would cost Chuck Box $0.33 cents if you used your card.  That's over 6% of the tab.

Personally, because of the cost of using a credit card to the business, I try to only use a credit card when there's a corporate owner (and believe me, they get much lower processing rates)

Anyways, love the burgers, especially the quac/bacon/cheese burger.  Ok fried 'shrooms, and they have a surprisingly good chili.  I've gone in JUST for the chili and a beer at times

The only real complaint I have about the place is that they open so late on Sundays.  When I lived nearby, there were many a hungover Sunday morning where I knew the only thing that would save my life was some Chuck Box.  Dare to dream that they'd stay open 24/7 . . ."}
{"text":"Wow, these are the best burgers and fries I have had in a very long time.  I asked for my burger to be well done, and it was made just right.  You can add all sorts of stuff at the fixings bar - even jalapenos!  I also ordered a delicious pitcher of beer - mmmm - they have several brands on draft.  The onion rings were \"just OK\".  Try the jalapeno poppers - they are also awesome.  There were four of us and including the beer, the entire meal was less than 30 bucks - you can't beat that!  Service was also outstanding!  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"While in Tempe ate here twice.  I'm not a huge burger eater but these were awesome.  Loved the size options and then can put your own toppings on.  All cooked right in front of you and to your perfection.  Cash only and very casual atmosphere but we loved that!  Great little place for a burger!"}
{"text":"it was ok but  2 burgers a tiny portion of fries and a coke for 14 bucks i coulda went and got sum charcoal and ground beef and made it  at home. next time i want a burger im goingto fat burger. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE"}
{"text":"As long as you are aware going in that this place is a dive, you won't regret having a burger here. We've been coming here for over twenty five years, and they alway serve a consistently good, greasy and delicious burger grilled over an open flame. Just be sure to have cash on hand or be ready to use the nearby ATM as they do not accept credit cards. Good stuff, though, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These people are such jerks. Plus you have to stand in a crowded area waiting for your burger to cook. Can you pay and sit down and wait for your food to be finished?  No... You must stand in a crowd like a fool for your food to be done. I tried to step out of this insanity and just pay... they said no, I had to wait right in front of the grill... \"So the video cameras will see me pay\". That's their system. What a joke!!! Cancel my order... No thanks. Maybe college kids will put up with communist style service... But no thanks."}
{"text":"The box is THE place to go 4 an excellent, top it yourself (which I like) perfectly cooked burger....I usually have the big one. If you're really hungry go 4 the double. Excellent rings 2. Word of warning though....PAY ATTENTION here folks...NO AC...if you're not a local, this is NOT the place 4 u after May 1st, got it....the rest of us don't wanna hear u crying in July!!!!"}
{"text":"Freakin best burgers have ever had. They make everything in front of you, which I absolutely love. Herd about the place from my boyfriend and I am in love! Friendly service, great staff but most importantly great food. Please bring cash before you come here, they do not accept credit or debit card. Kind of noisy but worth it. :-)"}
{"text":"I could enjoy a bid bacon cheeseburger every day! Always cooked in front of me, server hot with onion rings. No heat lamps here. Bring cash, no CC accepted."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.

The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.

The Angus burger at McDonald's has better flavor than this one, and that's pretty bad."}
{"text":"Sorry I accidentally hit takes credit cards, ChuckBox only takes cash. Never fear if you don't have cash, they have an ATM machine in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Felt like memory lane-ing it today, so I headed to Chuck Box. It is as required at ASU as ENG101, so I am an old hand at this, but as a new Yelper, I found myself looking at it with fresh eyes today.

Yeah, you yell your order from the back of a long line. Yeah they clown you if you look confused. Bacon swiss medium. Fries 

\"FRIES!\" 

Buns are Aunt Hatties, cups are styrofoam, however they go paper on the plates...standard Costco that my mom serves all of our family party meals on.

Meat is great, one of the best burgers in town if only because it is the one of the only left that doesn't resort to frozen patties. Bacon is delightful.

Under 10 for everything including tip. Sat on a wooden box turned sideways. College chic. Okay, college dump, but it is much more wonderful under the haze of a few hundred hungover weekends.

Basically, a very solid independant no frills burger joint, kept thriving by those at ASU, and those like me, who still hold on to that fond charbroiled memory of ASU.

Cash only."}
{"text":"I love me some mesquite grilled burgers. The Chuck Box does it right!  Stopped in tonight as I was really in the mood for a good burger... They absolutely did not disappoint.  Contrary to other reviews, they do have healthy options... Wheat buns. ;-) their fried mushrooms were also very tasty.  Give it a try, you will absolute go back again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, like the burgers I remember growing up, tasty, juicy and plentiful. I ordered the basic burger with American cheese. The patty was huge and tasty, not dry at all. The buns they use are pretty basic, sesame seed. It did start falling apart towards the end but that may have been because of all the toppings I added. The toppings bar is off to the side so you can add whatever you like and add as little or as much as you like. Their fries, onion rings and fried zucchini were fine, nothing spectacular but weren't bad. CASH ONLY btw!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, decent prices the only downside is cash only. I understand there is a fee associated with taking  cards. But it's 2014."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is that they only accept cash. Other than that this place is on my number 1 list for having the best burger I have ever eaten. To describe the burger I had was sooo juicy inside, the outside was chared crispy from the open flame, the bun was air fluffed soft and the cheese was very cheese. I would take a bite I can see the juices from the burger drip. Everytime I think of this place my mouth begins to water :-P"}
{"text":"What a great burger, cooked on an open wood fire, with plenty of toppings to go around. Went here on the recommendation of a friend and got the bacon cheese burger with pepper jack. The bacon isn't your usual bacon, something a little closer to canadian bacon. Not crispy but just very thinly cut bacon in a large circle. The fries were really good too and the place has that old wild west outpost feel to it. 

Sadly there's only one drawback to this place: CASH ONLY. I was very sad to see this as I don't carry cash usually. I would have bought much more if I could have used my debit card, and I was really disappointed that i couldn't. This will certainly limit how often I will return."}
{"text":"Favorite spot to grab a burger in the valley! Offering can be complicated so if you didn't go to ASU ask questions. Burners are always exceptional and filling. Give it 11 stars if I could."}
{"text":"One look at this place and you know they are going to serve you up a manly slab of beef!  Great place for burgers, one of my favorites in the phoenix valley.  Its a staple in Tempe, I just hope ASU doesnt tear them down like they do with all the good local places.  Go in and support a great restaurant and get a tasty burger while your at it.  

Condiments bar is a great touch!"}
{"text":"Spots okay nothing amazing, always packed inside. Hard to find a seat, only takes cash.. Burgers are nothing crazy.. I've had plenty of better burgers. The selection is nice and free of charge to put anything inside. Place is okay. You can find better in tempe."}
{"text":"Very sad day when the Chuckbox moved from Scottsdale Rd and Shea.  I guess the real-estate was too valuable.  Great prices, now  I have to take a drive BUT well worth it"}
{"text":"I have worked a block away from The Chuck Box for the last three years, but I only gave it a shot a couple of months ago, and then I kicked myself for not walking in this place years earlier.  I'm a vegetarian, and this may be the reason I would have never considered going into this place, until I discovered (via Yelp) that they have a veggie burger on their menu.  I order my veggie burger with pepper jack cheese, and two slices of grilled pineapple, and it is delicious.  By the way, hands down, The Chuck Box has the best fries in Tempe.

Now, there are a couple of reasons why I'm giving The Chuck Box four stars instead of five:  1) They only take cash, no cards, and this is a little frustrating in 2009.  There is an ATM in the place, but of course there is a fee for taking cash out, so you can add $2.50 to the cost of your lunch, which can kill the cost-effectiveness of eating at this place.  2) This place can get really busy and the ordering system is abrasive, i.e. the cook yelling at people to take their order.  Now, some people probably love this system, because it creates a unique atmosphere, but I just find it kind of nerve-racking.

A side note for vegetarians: If you have a problem with your food being cooked on grill that has had meat products cooked on it, where your veggie burger is in close proximity to meat on the grill, you will probably have a problem eating here."}
{"text":"A great new fun memory. 5 stars for the entire experience and service. The burger was great and reminded me of a backyard BBQ. 

Good times. Thanks"}
{"text":"Great Burgers and it's next to ASU in Tempe. This place is always a fun and a tasty treat. The outside is an old rusty brown building that reminds me of a hippie shack out in the woods. The smell of mesquite smoke and burgers hit you as you get out of your car. The inside is also very hip with a simple old timey feeling such as thick wooden crates for seats, barrels for trash cans and amusing tidbits hanging on the walls.

Easy menu to pick from with several burger or chicken options as well as sides. You can choose from Little to Big to Great BIG as far as sizes of burgers. I always get the Great BIG one which is a 1/2 pound of juicy CHUCK with the cheese of my choice and some green chilies. They cook it right before your eyes while standing in line. I also enjoy the onion rings which are beer battled and really big and tasty. The condiment bar is very large with plenty of room to stock up on all the things you would want at a family picnic and then some. Nice.

Parking is tricky being next to the campus. Bring change for the meter if you cannot get in their private lot. Also get there as early as possible to avoid the long line of HUNGRY people. CASH ONLY. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perfect timing as we rolled into this joint just before a massive crowd built up behind us about 8pm on a Saturday night. Our two burgers were the only ones on the grill for a good five minutes before an avalanche of chicken and beef entered the foray. I ordered my 1/3 pounder from Juan well done and it was fresh beef and seasoned with salt/pepper it seemed. Good sesame buns and a solid order of onion rings (its from a bag, but a gourmet bag at least). Condiment bar was well stocked and it was  a great burger with a unique ordering experience and atmosphere. Unless your at Behihana, you never get to interact with the cook, so now if he didn't make it well done. I can give up it right back, but it was. so no problem. Probably the best in the $6 burger category."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. Don't be fooled by the way it looks!!
It is not very customer service orientated but the food makes up for it. Trust me"}
{"text":"Amazing burger spot. Juan (who's worked there for 30+ years) really has the science of a perfectly grilled burger figured out. With that and competitive prices you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I am always in search of a good burger...while my search will always continue this place will go in my top 5! We must have gotten there just at the right time because there wasn't much of a line. I did however see the \"cash only\" sign right away which might be annoying to some. This is my kinda place though-a hole in the wall with delicious simple food! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and I loooove how they made the circular bacon to fill the whole burger! I can see how the condiment station might be a turnoff for some but considering I like my burger pretty plain it didn't really bother me. We rode the light rail so we didn't have issues with parking but I can see how the parking might be problematic around lunch time. I dig the tree stumps as chairs but that's just me. We got 2 burgers/fries and 2 drinks for 20 bucks and it was worth every penny. Every few months I think about becoming a vegetarian, it's places like this that make me realize what a ludicrous idea that would be!"}
{"text":"So, I finally got to try the Chuck Box. I took the advice of other reviewers and stayed away from The Little One and got The Big One and was very happy with it. First of all, BRING CASH - no cards accepted. There was a small setback while we were waiting for the food to be cooked, however the staff handled it very well and quickly picked up the slack. My boyfriend got the Tijuana Torpedo with green chilies on top. It was great. So were the onion rings, perfectly cooked! Wash it all down with a lemonade = VERY REFRESHING! I can't wait to go back. With all of those toppings, I'm sure even the garden burger would be delicious! (Not that I don't like garden burgers; I do! I just didn't think it would be the best representation of the Chuck Box.)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here and it's been too long.  Burgers are outstanding!  This a quintessential college joint, a true gem in Tempe."}
{"text":"I really liked The Chuck Box. It was recommended to us by a friend. It's not a fancy place by any stretch but the wood-fired burgers are great. They do not wait on you. You go through line after you order and pick up your order as it is made. I will go there again the next time we are in Tempe."}
{"text":"No frills and chill burger joint. Cheap too! Their fried zucchini and fried mushroom sides were interesting.

I got the barbecue chicken sandwich, which takes longer to cook. Boyfriend got the big burger. They have a toppings bar, so that was cool!

Parking lot is tight and the line can get long during dinnertime. Also, it's cash only, but there's an ATM inside.

I thought it was cool they have wine on tap!

It's cheap enough that I would come back if I wanted a burger better than McDonald's but didn't want to cook it myself.

They grill the burgers with coal. Hank Hill would be mad!"}
{"text":"this wood shack has been in tempe for as long as i can remember and i've probably been.. two times, maybe three?
for as much as everyone swears by these burgers, i thought they were just ok. it's served and order counter style, so it's very casual -and very busy at lunch time during the week.
nothing in particular to complain about, just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Nothing great about this burger. The grill is most impressive. After that it just ok. Part of it may be expectations. I had high expectations because it reminded me of a grill place in Albuquerque. I can't decide if that is it, or I just didn't like the burger. Green Chile was like lettuce, iceberg lettuce. The onions that I piled on, were also flavorless. However, I did think they had the smoothest, great tasting root beer! Wow. Now that is special. I wish it was sugar free so I could drink more of it, but no. I just had a few sips from Brad's glass. It is dark inside, which I liked. The decor is simple and ingenious. Very comfortable seating. Had to try it, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best local burger joints around.

Its a unique experience. A definite must for ASU students and visitors. This place is part of history. The burgers are fairly priced and taste delicious. The environment is unlike any other burger chain.

Quick service. Great burgers. Cash only though."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a feeling that you feel that you ate too much but you still feel good and not heavy? It's that kind of place. It tells you for the quality of food. I used to think rehab burger is the best joint in Phoenix..but then yesterday I went to Chuck box. Simple and cheap menu but it the meat is fresh and light. They cook it right infront of you and you can see the sizzle. It's a perfect place to go for a burger. Cash only so be prepared. I believe it's the best burger in the valley. One of the best I have ever had. Awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Phoenix. (Disclaimer: I've only lived here for a year, but that being said, thus far, best burger I've found around these parts) 
PS get the onion rings!!!"}
{"text":"This is where you go for an AMAZING burger. The food quality is just unbelievable! First time here I really wanted jalapeño poppers but the order was too big considering i ordered fries and a burger and onion rings already all of which were superb!  As if that wasn't good enough one of the guys brought me a small order with 3 jalapeño poppers and they we're so delicious! It has a nice little kick back feel to the place. I will definitely be  back, the prices are so reasonable and the food has such a great taste and quality to it. If you like good food and great prices definitely come here! Literally best burgers in town! Lenny's ain't got nothing on them! I would literally give this place 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Upon entering the chuck burger, I was welcomed with a yelling \"WHOS NEXT\" and an annoyed request for my order.  Although they have guacamole, the chefs are too lazy to slice avocado for more health conscious customers.  The bacon guacamole burger was a 7/10, pretty good! The fries weren't bad, but the tap water leaves an unpleasant metallic aftertaste.  Although the food is good, I would not come again."}
{"text":"This place is the real article. The meat is cooked right in front of you and it's all custom. The fixings bar rocks. Everything is really fresh and delicious and the ambience is what you expect for this type of food."}
{"text":"Everyone talked about this place and how great the burgers were. I have to disagree... I didn't like that there were not a lot of bun options or even topping options. To me, it was just a plain burger I could have made at home and paid less. In and out serves better burgers."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had.  I feel like almost everyone in Tempe knows this already but I was reviewing another lesser than burger place and all I could think about was why didn't I just go to chuck box? Get the big one with bacon and maybe try the grilled green chilli pepper on top!"}
{"text":"06/29/2018. Great place if your craving a nice grilled burger or chicken. The menu is pretty simple and your able to add your own unlimited toppings. I love the bacon its comes in round shape perfect for your burger. Onion rings were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joint there is in AZ. Fresh grilled burgers on an open flame grill they use wood/logs and not charcoal. Cooks it right front of you and you wait for your burger to be finished cooking before you pay. 

I first found this place when I was going to ASU, some classmates and I were wanting to go somewhere to study for our final exam and we were all hungry. One classmate referred this place. So we ended up here and I loved it.

I havent been here for years after, until one day my BF was craving for a burger and he wanted a real burger. Not no Mcdonalds or Burger King burgers. So I told him there was this burger joint that I once went to when going to school. I took him over here. He ordered a one patty burger and I had the chicken sandwich and he was in Love. He never knew about this place and always wanted find a place that makes a real burger. Now hes all about Chuck Box. The second time I brought him here he ordered the double patty. It was quite big and fulfilling for him. We usually order a side of fries and sometimes the onion rings as well.

Theres a condiment station when in the middle of the shop where you can add whatever you want on your burger which is pretty cool because its to your liking and you can put whatever on it. 

One side note: they ONLY accept cash. So make sure you have cash before you come here. However they do have a atm machine, but to avoid getting charge a fee I suggest you come with cash in hand ready."}
{"text":"This immediately became my \"i need to eat here every time I'm in Phoenix spot.\" I don't even care that it's not cooked to my preferred medium-rare. It's that good. Cool spot. Love watching them cook it right in front of you. Great that you get to put whatever ratio and amount of toppings on yourself. Instant favorite."}
{"text":"Flying solo.  It's a burger joint.  Plain and simple.  Small menu with the basics.  But the basics are so good.   Great burger.  Juicy.  Cooked just right.  Would love to come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this place! The burgers are cooked right there in front of you so they are really fresh and hot! No worries about what you want on it except cheese. There is a condiment bar so make it your way! There fries were pretty good. And the burger maker guy was cool! The cash guy lacked personality but maybe he was having a off day!
The only draw back is the cash only part...But 3 of us ate for 25 bucks!!"}
{"text":"Even after all these years, the Chuck Box is still cranking out the beat burgers.  They have been doing burger the right way since my first visit in 1979.  They still only accept cash, they do have an ATM if you forget.  Great selection of toppings including jalapeños. Only item missing was Thousand Island.  Even without it the burgers were great.  We were not even the oldest either.  We can't wait to go back.  Small is perfect for most appetites but they have bigger sizes for larger appetites."}
{"text":"A very good charbroiled burger. Lots of topping choices. Onion rings were awesome and most importantly,  they are effecient."}
{"text":"We heard about this place constantly for a year when we moved here, so we had to give it a shot. I would go back for the atmosphere.  The food and price was alright, considering the atmosphere.  I really like the way they decorate the place, and the fact their toppings you can throw on yourself were fresh every time we showed up."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal if you want some awesome burgers near ASU. Chuck Box has been around for decades and I just had to see what the burgers were all about. I decided to try their small cheeseburger and fries. You can tell that them putting the patties on the charcoal grill makes a huge difference as far as taste, and it was very good. Their fries too are some of the better ones that I've had as well.

While the food was certainly very good and I would come back here again, there are some gripes that I have with this place. Parking around here can be difficult which could potentially deter me from coming here more often. Also, the ordering assembly line style can be awkward somewhat at times but it's not a big deal to me. As long as the food is good I don't really care about those things but I just wanted to make others aware of them.

I do anticipate coming back here again as the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Omg I couldn't love this place any more than I do. They will always be a great place to get a burger your way! I love the sitting area, its old school fabulous and doesn't change. Change isn't always better. They cook the burger to your liking, you add what you want on it. It goes fast so don't be discouraged when you see the line. Its so cool to watch the guy cooking. You will love it and your burger too!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past The Chuck Box for years, but never stopped and ate until yesterday! Brian and I were in the mood for a nice juicy burger after church and just happened to drive by and decided to pull in. Thank God we did! OMG... this rustic looking burger joint in the heart of Tempe has the best fricken burger in town! Grilled right over a fire, this chef is Amazing; we enjoyed just watching him cook the burgers - a treat in itself! We were impressed how fast the service is how the burgers are cooked JUST PERFECT.  The 'fix'n' bar is cold and fresh - the tomatoes were my favorite! Mmmm... I could go on and on... I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it. I had the great big one and Brian had a double great big one. We also got fries, onion rings, and two beers. Everything was GREAT = we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice smoked burgers cooked on a real charcoal grill in a quaint little southwest style cabin. I like the \"great big one\" with green chillies (aka: tijuana torpedo)."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night around 9PM.  There were a few small groups in the restaurant, if you want to call it that.  Their burger is similar to a BBQ burger.  Nothing too unique about the taste.  Fries though were crispy and fried well.  The condiment bar was well kept and fresh.  The ambiance was pretty depressing.  I felt like I was in a tavern established along an interstate.  I needed to get in, get out with something in my stomach that would get me by.  Job accomplished."}
{"text":"The best way I would sum up ChuckBox is that it is a really really good backyard burger. It's very juicy and delicious. The burgers are simple, and that's how I like.

Notes: Cash only, ATM inside"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best burger I've had in about 8 years... been there a few times now, and they are consistently good.  As others have mentioned, cash only... Also not cheap.. but simple and really good for what it is.  I suggest going later in the afternoon, or get there around 11 or slightly earlier, they are packed during lunch/dinner, but 3:30 if you do a late lunch or early dinner is pretty mellow.

Onion rings are great, as is the fried zucchini and the fries are decent too."}
{"text":"The bad reviews really bug me. If you don't like the burgers it's your own fault because literally everything on it is because of you! It is the most authentic backyard barbecue/ campfire burger you can get. It's served on paper plates just like a campsite or a backyard barbecue. Are we too classy for paper plates? The burger has charred edges and makes it authentic and amazing. And the cost?? You can't. Can't. CANT! Beat that cost. You are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here. Only downside is cash only. NOTHING food related. I will be back. OFTEN."}
{"text":"Man, I usually have my spots but after word of mouth from a friend, and seeing the reviews I HAD to  come check this place out!! This place throws down on some burgers!!

I got the Tijuana Torpedo, wifee got the cheeseburger. We got the drinks and fries, but saw they had beer battered onion rings. I'm a sucker for them, so you already know !

The food was amazing! Sounds like a lot of hype but very very good and reasonably priced. The grill chef cooked the burgers perfect! Tipped him just for that fact! 
Very appreciative he prepared my meal. Did I mention they cool on a charcoal grill!!

You can tell the fryer oil was fresh too. My fries were golden colored, and not tinted like fries cooked in old oil usually look. Onion rings golden brown....SO GOOD!

The condiment bar was all fresh, and the crate style seating is awesome!!

Note: 
Make sure to bring cash. If you don't have any no worries, they have an atm inside.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint that's reasonably priced (for a large grilled burger)  It's a little pricier than fast food, but it's much more than any fast food burger. They work pretty fast to get the line through and get the orders done. It can be a bit of a cattle chute - but that tends to be part of the atmosphere. They have a large, if pretty standard condiment bar - ketchup, mustard, lettuce, pickles. If you want something beyond that, this is not the place - unless you bring it along."}
{"text":"First of all, the ordering process is hassling at best. You have to wait in line with tons of rowdy, ugly college students/grumpy elderly folk for your order. They need to have a better format for that because the lines are constantly crowded with people jostling each other.

Second, my dad makes better burgers. And his are only moderately satisfying. There was nothing special about these burgers, and don't get me started on the substandard wings. I feel like I insulted myself and my taste buds just by letting myself go to this place. You can find better, cheaper burgers at In-n-out.

:)"}
{"text":"First things first, this is the best burger in Tempe.  Juicy, flavorful, and just the right size (if you get the great big one).  Good selection of condiments, too.

The onion rings and mushrooms are good, too (although it's hard to finish the mushrooms).  Nothing like a pile of grease to get your heart a workout.

The fries are nothing special.  They taste like your standard notch-above-BK fries... Not crap, but won't have you coming back like Five Guys fries."}
{"text":"I went to ASU for 4 years and only visited ChuckBox once due to my roommate dragging me along.  I remember it being packed and we ended up having to sit outside in the heat so my experience at that time wasn't the best and I never went back.
However the other day I was craving a burger and decided to give it another try.  Man, I don't know what I was thinking the first time around.  The burgers are amazing!  I love the charbroiled taste! 
It does take a while to get your foot because it is cooked as needed right in front of you, so the line can grow to be fairly long while people stand there and wait for their order.  They have a bar in the middle of the restaurant that has all the fixins for you to add to your burger (ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.)
Some of the downsides that made me give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are no refills on drinks, it's cash only, and there aren't any covers for the small fixin bar (there where a couple of flies hovering around the lettuce and pickles that grossed me out).
But in terms of their burgers, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"So...
I stopped in around mid afternoon for a couple of cheeseburgers with mom and I gotta say it's been awhile since I've been able to get in due to heavy foot traffic for this establishment. I ordered and sat with our food and it was very dry and not even juicy like it was the last few times. I seen him cook burgers before but... he had a large takeout order after ours and I guess he forgot how to cook.
So disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Love the hamburgers and that they have A1 steak sauce. Onion rings are good also. They only take cash though."}
{"text":"Friends and I  were near Tempe and it's spring break so we might actually get in without much of a line.  Crowded but not overly so, recognized a staff member of two that were still there from my ASU days.  Brings back good memories and a few foggy ones, burgers are still nice and fresh but thin and spread out instead of thick which is fine, if you want a medium you might order a medium rare and adjust the other options as needed.  Great to get back to an old time favorite."}
{"text":"The positive is that the ingredients are fresh and you are able to moderate what's on your burger. Ummmm..still thinking....yeah that was the positive. The burgers are okay nothing to come
Running back to. The place has an original appeal but always seems unclean.  I've had better I've had worse. If you want a burger and are in the area this will do."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Chuck Box... Droooool...

So this place looks kind of run down, some of the staff looks a little scary, and there's literally a 1\" thick layer of grime on the brick next to the grill that's probably taken 40 years to build up, but damn is it a good burger. This is one of those places where they go out of their way to disgust you and you still come back because the food is so good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My girlfriend doesn't like burgers but if its Chuck box, she craves it!!!

The burgers and fries are good, but a MUST try are the jalapeño poppers!! These things are freaking delish to the point I have to get one for me and one for the girlfriend. 

When we go to AZ this is 1 of 3 spots we must make time to eat at!"}
{"text":"Average burger joint, I like the idea of making your own burger but there's nothing really unique about the taste. Burger was average tasting, the bun was sesame seed average, and the toppings were average as well. I'd go here again if it was my only choice at the time."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best burger in AZ. 

Very simple, great ingredients and the best tasting grilled meat.  

You place your order and then watch it being cooked, then head over to the condiments bar which is always fresh and filled with great ingredients.  The place has a nice old western vibe and the focus on the food which is all you want when you go to grub."}
{"text":"Wow. This is everything a no-frills burger place should be. The burgers are cooked on the open charcoal grill right in front of you as you wait. They have a perfect list of toppings for your burger without it being overwhelming. We went around noon on a Tuesday while school was not in session. No wait and just enough room for me and my 5 coworkers. I can imagine it's probably busier during the school year. 

I got the The Big One with cheese, bacon and green chile and a side of fries. It was the perfect size for me for lunch. I couldn't get over how amazing the flavor was on the burger. I'm still thinking about it three days later. The fries were good but nowhere near the star. I would've been fine without them. But that burger. Mmmmm. I can't wait to go back!!

PS - It's cash only but they do have an ATM on-site. Also, it's very affordable!"}
{"text":"So Michael and I drove all the way here on Sunday because he was craving a hamburger (again)... of course there are quite a few places in central phoenix that have good burgers but I guess we were feeling adventurous and decided to travel to downtown Tempe to the Chuck Box.   I have memories of the Chuck Box from when I was a little kid and used to go to work with my dad during the summer... he worked at the ASU Student Book Center on College Ave and we would come here often for lunch.  Back then everything seemed much bigger from the size of the place to the size of the burgers.   While Michael and I were perusing the menu we noticed (out loud) that the menu and the condiment bar were almost exactly the same as Hamburger Works in Phoenix.  The guy behind the counter mentioned that the manager of the Chuck Box was part owner of Hamburger Works... it all makes sense now:)... and i guess we didn't have to drive that far after all.   The burgers were tasty and so were the fries... it really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Best Burger in Tempe.
Guys are great and the atmosphere is refreshing no chain burger joint a real treat !!!"}
{"text":"What you get: Burgers grilled over mesquite while you sweat in front of the fire, a table of fix in's to complete your masterpiece, and ice cold beer in a mason jar.  Oooooh, baby..

The Chuckbox is a worthy Tempe institution.  It looks like it was built by the first settlers, and they did a damn fine job.  At lunch time there's usually a line, so it can be harder to gain admission here than at ASU.  But it's worth he wait (and it won't take 4 years to get out).

The big one (with cheese) is terrific, and so delicious even beer like Michelob tastes good.  Or get an incredibly delicious Great Big One, or fries or rings or shrooms.  On a nice day, the porch is great for watching the world  go by while getting mustard on your shirt.  You just can't go wrong here.

If you're not alone, the pitcher is a better deal.  Dont worry, if you look thirsty, they'll remind you."}
{"text":"This place is a total hole in the wall you walk in and it seems like your in the middle of Juarez. the roof is covered in bean sacks, tables are made of crates, the place doesn't take credit cards cash only but the food makes up for it! Awesome fresh burgers cooked in front of you also a good local beer selection which is served to you in a mason jar. Gotta love it."}
{"text":"This is great spot to get a flame broiler burger and your own fixings.  The prices are great.  Come if you're craving a burger and you're in the area.  Def not necessary to make a trek over.  Parking is sparse and the place will likely be packed with college students."}
{"text":"Best place to get a burger in Tempe! The burgers have that off the bbq grill taste which is the best. Been here twice and i was not disappointed at all.The condiment bar is cool too. I like how it's decorated in the inside. It has a cow boy theme to it which alot of people hate for some reason. It's cash only but going there when you only have cash makes it a special treat."}
{"text":"The Chuck Box has fresh and delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches.  They grill  your food right in front of you and they have a great condiment bar so you can get just the right amount of toppings."}
{"text":"On our first trip I ordered a chili cheese burger. The burgers were huge and the chili kept sliding off. It was so messy I couldn't enjoy it. The place was packed, the line was long and my overall feeling was \"meh\". I didn't plan to return. 

Recently I went back with my brother when there was a small, reasonable line (and he wanted a burger). This time I went with a basic cheeseburger. My brother had a bacon cheeseburger with fries. We both enjoyed the fresh meat and toppings. They also had a fruity  iced tea which not only tasted great but was very fresh. It's now back \"on the list\" of burger spots!"}
{"text":"I'd heard of this place but had never been there until the other day when I was in the area and we decided to stop for lunch. It was ok, dumpy and hot inside, restrooms are located out back. I get that this is probably one of those places people are nostalgic about more than a place they visit for the food itself.  Our chargrilled burgers were ok, I guess for the money I'd prefer to go somewhere a little nicer and more comfortable than sitting on a wooden crate. The onion rings were probably the best part."}
{"text":"Large burgers that will be sure to stuff you! The outside and inside may appear a little dingy but don't let that steer you away. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it certainly was worth every penny I paid."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great burgers! Loved the fries and their ranch! Definitely need to check it out"}
{"text":"I realized today I haven't reviewed my favorite burger joint in the valley. The Chuckbox is truly the best burger place in town. I am careful with the types of oils I put in my body. I don't have any really weird requirements I just prefer to eat things that are natural, not chemically altered mutations. That being said Chuckbox uses healthy oils (still fattening but not mutated) for their French fries and it is fabulous to indulge in that sinful pleasure. Their burgers are made of the highest quality meat and cooked to order (yes even rare) on a huge wood burning grill. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. If you are a true foodie I know you have already discovered this Tempe gem but if you haven't get in your car and head there ASAP. You will thank me profusely for this review. I would give them 10 stars if I could. One thing before you go, bring cash, they do not take credit cards. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Chuckbox with a group of friends. First of all, I don't think it was stated enough it's closer to a fast food place than restaurant. It's a similar setup to Ted's Hot Dogs except it's pretty dark in there and when we went there were only 2 people working there. 1 guy on grill, 1 at register and doing everything else while he was at it. Which meant he wasn't always at the register. The burgers were good, not great and I'm not sure I agree with most of the hype. Great place if I lived near ASU to walk and grab a quick burger but overall it was pretty average."}
{"text":"Not so good sorry. Dirty, and just not good. Will not go back  the service was awful, the condiments were old and crusty! There was no A/C, the tables were dirty. Didn't want to eat my food there!"}
{"text":"So I came to the chuck box off of a recommendation from a friend.  He stated that it was the best burger he's ever had and even was wanting to throw down a 20 dollar bet on this burger he was so confident.   Well after my first visit here I think he owes me 20 bucks. 

First I want to say that I've had a lot of burgers in my day.  Some really good and some really bad.  One of the first signs to me of a burger that won't break my top 3 list is when I can't order it medium rare.  

We got to the chuck box around noon and the place was packed to the gills.  We waited in line and I ordered the big one with cheddar on a white bun.  The burger looked decent off the grill but the bun was something I could buy at Costco (another sign of a top 3 ranking burger is a good home made bun)

I didn't have an issue with the lack of options at the condiment bar other than how the onions were diced to put on a burger made for an awkward experience. 

First bite was decent enough and all the onions then fell off the burger due to how they were diced.  About half way through the burger, my bun was completely falling apart.  The onion rings were decent but yet again I've had better.  

All in all it wasn't a bad burger but it wasn't at all the best I've had.   I'm pretty sure this place stays in business because it's on a college campus, it's cheap, and what college kid doesn't love a good cheap burger.  Since I have no college memories of this place to make it seem better than it really is I am impartial and can just rate the food.  All in all a decent experience but doubtful I will make the drive again for lunch."}
{"text":"This was by far the best meal I had all week.  

CONS:
*cash only - I HATE that.  Very inconvenient.  I never have cash.
*the process of standing in line, yelling your order over and then waiting for your food to be cooked while still standing in line.

PROS:
*$20 for 2 big burgers, fries and a pitcher of beer!!!
*The most delicious Tijuana Torpedo burger ever
*yummy fries
*ice cold, frosted beer glasses

I can't wait to go back.  The topping bar did nothing for me but the chili and cheese on my burgers were plenty for taste and moisture."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place so many times and always wanted to stop in.  We decided to take the light rail this weekend and check it out.  Delicious burgers and fries in a rustic, fun setting.  Love that you can top your own burger too.  Make sure to bring enough cash or your card to withdrawal money...no credit cards accepted here.  Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Love this place....they do burgers right! Great service too....the guys are real down to earth and customer focused....the
Menu is relatively small.....but there's no reason to eat a burger anywhere else inTempe....."}
{"text":"Excellent yummy deliciousness and all of the above!
I'm visiting from Cali,SD & driving around Ariz. Lookin for a Spot to eat, I stumble into this littl corner of Real Charbroil heaven! Food is so dam good and customer service is off the grill!  \"the grill master-Juan is #1\"!
On my way back to Cali, I grabbed a box to go. 
I soooo recommend this spot. Mmmmm good"}
{"text":"Been to this place since I was a kid and still have the best burgers around.  They do everything charcoal grill which taste so good.  Only burger joint I know that serve beer on tap.  Cash only place.  They do not accept credit card since they have to keep the price down."}
{"text":"Chuckbox before an ASU football game.  Great tradition and great burgers.  The Tijuana Torpedo is my favorite.  Good tasting onion rings as well."}
{"text":"I was told that the Chuckbox would have the best burger I EVER had, ever.  
I was not lied to.
The 1/2 pound burger I had was fantastic.  I also had onion rings and and an ice cold beer to wash it all down.
Their menu is not extensive, but it did not need to be.  They do one thing, and they ARE the best.  
Well, at least the best I've ever had yet.
If you can recommend a better burger: please let me know."}
{"text":"I really don't get what all the fuss is about. There was really nothing special, nothing even average about the place. The burger had no flavor to it - just tasted like ordinary ground beef with seasoned salt. The fries weren't all that great, and the bun was nondescript. There was a ton of bacon, which may sound like a good thing, but several layers of thin bacon will never beat a single layer of good quality thick-cut bacon.

It really isn't the friendliest place around - the guy taking orders wasn't really rude, but didn't seem to go out of his way to be friendly.

But it did get very busy a little after I got there, so obviously a lot of people disagree with me. But I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I sometimes forget how great a burger is served here. Flam cooked to order with your choice cheese, Chile or sauce. Great for everyone with choices of chicken, beef and veggie burgers. Toppings are added on at your choice from a toppings bar located inside the \"box.\""}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!! Bring your outside voice when you order here cause you may find yourself at the back of the line and being asked what you want. The burgers are cooked on an open flame right in front of you and are full of flavor. I can make one of these at home but when eating out this is the place to go. Get a Great Big One!"}
{"text":"If you don't have a grill in your own backyard and are looking for a classic American 4th of July BBQ in the park kind of burger, The Chuckbox is the place for you. We finally visited this place after hearing about it from even before coming to Arizona. It is a bit of a legendary location in the local community.

The atmosphere reminded me of a loud, crowded cafeteria, which is not my style for dining in. I found the ordering process to be unpleasant. You basically stand in a huge line and wait for the burgers to be cooked, which does take a few minutes. Meanwhile, the line interweaves with people who are placing orders, so everyone is in everyone's way. Then, once you receive your food, you wait another 5 or so minutes for someone to come to the register and cash you out. Ironically, while you wait with your ever-cooling food at the register, you are faced with a sign that explains how they only accept cash because it keeps the line moving fast...

The burger itself was pretty good, but nothing unique or special. As I mentioned, it really makes you think of that classic American grilled burger. One thing that I liked was the condiments bar, which allows everyone to add their own extras to their plain burger. In particular, I noticed that the tomatoes, pickles, and jalapeños were all extremely fresh. It's hard to get a decent tomato at a Subway or a even a 20-star fancy restaurant, so I commend this place for serving such fresh toppings. In addition, I took a bite of a very tasty not-so-all-American garden burger, which tells me some of the non-traditional burgers may be worth trying."}
{"text":"Went here when I was visiting Tempe! Decent place with the grill out by the counters. I got a chicken burger which was good but not too great! Also got the fried mushrooms which could have been seasoned better.  

Also, they are CASH ONLY so remember to swing by the ATM."}
{"text":"I usually try to make it here a couple of times a month but in all seriousness I could eat here every day and never get tired of the place. Best to get there before 11:00 just to find a place to park. Nothing beats a great cheese burger and a cold draft beer."}
{"text":"Been here once in 2010 but it was great.  It's a throwback to the 80s, no credit cards accepted, cash only.  Not sure how much business they lose doing this but it's a local eatery, it's that place you only know about if you live here.  Burgers were delish, freshly cooked, great flavor.  If you're after great tasting meat, and you're not vegetarian, come here."}
{"text":"Chuck Box = best fast food burger in the Phoenix area.  Not to mention, they're fries are awesome.  Their fried zucchini is to die for.  Yes, you might clog an artery eating here, but it's a burger joint.  I'd much rather gain a couple of pounds here than at McDonald's or its counterparts."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Their grilled chicken sandwich with green chilies is pretty incredible too.  Thank you, Chuck Box Team for always making our visit delicious & memorable."}
{"text":"I fly to Arizona just have a burger at the Chuckbox...ok just kidding.
I travel to PHX fairly often and one night I was jonesing for a burger. I called up Fatburger and they were closed at 8PM. OK seriously, who closes a burger joint in a college town at 8PM? That's just pure insanity but I digress. So there was no burger to be had and I had to has a cheeseburger NOW! By a stroke of luck someone mentioned the chuck wagon and I wondered how bad could it be? I trekked through ASU and then I reached meat heaven. It wasn't the Chuck Wagon, it was the Chuck Box. I ordered my cheeseburger and fries. Just picture that scene in When Harry Met Sally. It was so good I needed a cigarette when I was done.

I've been back a few times and the last time I tried the Chili. It was a generous serving, very tasty and most importantly it didn't give me the farts."}
{"text":"Best Burger in the valley! Even the Garden Burger is Amazing! The condiments are always fresh especially the tomato's.  Reasonably price, just be aware this is a cash only business! Parking can be a pain some times but that's any where on or around campus! The employees are very straight forward, If you're cool with them they will be cool with you! Be ready to order, they'll ask you what you want while your standing in line. I recommend adding green chilly to any of the burgers! Don't forget to order fries, they are not included..


The Chuck Box Is Number Juan!!"}
{"text":"The chuck box was good. The setting was pretty cool when walking in and the service was great. The food was good and had taste. You can put whatever you want on your burger as they have a salad bar for your amenities."}
{"text":"I came and had lunch and it was your standard fair. Another time I was a paying customer and needed to run to a separate business and they actually had a bouncer make me move my car despite having utilized their business. That ticked me off.  No question about how much time i might need (20 minutes) just to blow off. So i get they need their parking, but during summer and with a good 7 or 8 other empty spots cut ppl slack. Consequently I am never going there and I am going to ly think bad of you. Btw, it's hot in your shack, your decor sucks and the seats uncomfortable and the condiments bar looks like it came out of my 5th grade cafeteria memories."}
{"text":"pros:
- probably the best burger i've ever had
- unique toppings
- wood charcoal grill
- fast service
- friendly owner

cons:
- cash only
- cold customer service

burgers alone, the chuck box takes the cake. they've perfected wood-fired grilling and manage to cook the meat to the right amount of juicy every time. they have ortega chilis that are to die for, bacon circles, pineapple, and anything else you could want on a burger. their chicken sandwiches are good, especially with teriyaki, but don't compare to their burgers.

by and large, though a couple staff members are amiable and talkative (especially the owner), the customer service is unfriendly, and even borders on rude. the restaurant exudes a pretty palpable sense of toxic masculinity, amplified by the western glorification theme, and this mentality seems to be adopted by some staff members. in terms of your experience here, this becomes relevant in the differences in respect they show toward men and women; my mom is never treated the same as my dad. an unfortunate and completely avoidable situation, but one that seems only to be perpetuated by their new hires. 

one last note: they only take cash, but have an ATM inside. would strongly recommend for a quick bite while in the ASU area."}
{"text":"One of the best classic burgers you can get. Gourmet burgers are amazing, but most of the time I just want something a little more simple, and this place does that the best. The staff is friendly and I love watching them make the burgers right in front of you. Insanely reasonable price too."}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger place.  We don't live close, but are willing to make the drive at least a couple times a month for this place. Our kids love it and have even requested it as their birthday dinner. I always get the Big One with cheddar.  The jalapeno poppers and fried zucchini are a must have.  The condiment bar has everything you need and has great ranch for dipping.  The cost is fair, for 2 people burgers and drinks with poppers and zucchini to share will run you about $21 dollars.  They only take cash so make sure you're prepared or you'll have to use the ATM inside which charges a fee.

The place looks very dirty and run down and you have to sit on crates.  The employees aren't the friendliest and the cashier/fry guy in the do-rag is scary (think Soup Nazi for you Seinfeld fans) so you better make sure you order correctly and quickly including which type of bun, stand in the correct spot while waiting for your food (basically right in front of the soda machine), move when you're supposed to (as soon as they call out your burger), have your cash ready and don't talk to him (unless you're going to talk about Star Trek).  

If you want clean and friendly don't come here, but if you're looking for the best burger around make sure to give it a try. The place can get pretty busy especially during the school year, so if you don't want to stand in a very large line try to get there for a late lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"First off, this place has a great name. One of the most famous burger places in the Valley, and definitely the most famous in Tempe. The building itself is pretty iconic. It's an all wood shack that you'd swear should be next to a swamp somewhere in Louisiana. Inside, you're immediately smacked in the face with a smokey aroma as they use a wood-fired broiler to give the burgers a mesquite flavor. It's set up cafeteria-style and kind of feels like you're expected to know how to order as it's all customizable with a  selection of toppings, cheeses, and bun types. For the veggies and sauces, there's a self-serve salad bar style set up for further customization.

The Burger - 7.5 (out of 10)
The marquee aspect of this burger is definitely the wood-flame broil as so few places cook their burgers that way. It's not the most practical cooking method and makes for a really smokey environment. Is the Burger Guy convinced this is a better burger cooking method than a well seasoned griddle? Nah. But it does give the burger a distinct flavor. The flame broil gives it a nice char that you can't get with a griddle. I got The Big One, a 1/3 pounder that I added American cheese and bacon too. My burger was juicy, cooked perfectly, and had a really nice flavor. What I wasn't impressed with was, well, everything else. The bun was a very pedestrian sesame seed job. The bacon, likewise, nothing to write home about. The veggies were basic but even the iceberg lettuce was looking pretty pitiful. And my biggest gripe: Because of the broiler, they can't grill onions! And you all know how The Burger Guy feels about grilled onions. A burger just isn't complete without them. Lastly, I don't think I like building my own burgers. I always screw up the ratios! Overall, a pretty delicious meat patty that's dragged down by the other components of the burger.

Note: Score is for the burger only. Other factors such as service, price, and ambience are not considered.

{"text":"Delicious yet so simple. Love how you they have the bar so you can out whatever and as much as you desire on your burger. Despite it being packed you get your order pretty quick"}
{"text":"I love this place! You build your own burger and the atmosphere is the best! I love the rustic look of this place and it is the best burger I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in AZ. The beef burgers are awesome, chicken burgers are great, fried zucchini are excellent. Fried mushrooms and onion rings are Ok.The restaurant itself is Ok, I think they should remodel and make sure to keep the tables clean. 

Negative would be that it is cash only. 

Go here if you want a really good burger and fried zucchini in a very casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Straight up best hamburgs in Tempe. Fresh beef grilled over mesquite charcoal  Simple and straight forward. No gimmicks.
 
I've been coming here since I was a kid with my family. 25 years. This Temple classic has stayed true to it's roots. 

One complaint. There is a guy who's always working there, usually on register, who is a complete A-hole. Aside from his crappy attitude the place is perfect. Thankfully you only have to deal with him for a minute while you pay or get frys."}
{"text":"Closed early, wouldn't serve me, not cool, not coming back. I've been going to the Chuck Box since I was a little kid - I'm an AZ native. This was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best burgers around.  This place hasn't changed in decades, and why should it!  I studied here for finals between 1976-80, drinking beer, reading, eating, drinking, then walk back to apt in dry desert heat.  Great memories, and great burgers."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers in town!  The best time to go is before ASU football games...it is packed though, be ready!  They have set up a second grill outside to help with the line.  Personally, ordering instead is worth the wait. 

One of the best things about this place is the bacon on their burgers.  Most places just throw a couple slices on the burger.  Not Chuck Box.  They have preformed pieces that are the shape of your burger.  This way, there is bacon in every bite.  YUM!  

Little known fact: they will add slices of green chile to your burger.  Just be aware they are actual slices, not chopped green chile so it will be slippery and add to the mess factor.

Be ready for the following things: cash only, parking sucks, and there may be a line (ESPECIALLY before games) so go early."}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations. Unfortunately they fell a bit short. It's a good place, but nothing to make a drive for. They only accept cash-- but it is reasonably priced. The food is good, it is sort of comparable to eating outside when your dad grills. All in all decent experience and decent service"}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat very often but this place is worth it! It was a GOOD hamburger. It's a treat to come here. The meat is cooked well and you get to put on the fixings the way you like it. I've got no complaints."}
{"text":"Best burger in town.  And their veggie burger is awesome as well.  Rod and RAF are always super friendly, food is always good.  Bring cash or you'll have to use the ATM inside.  Very local spot, 45 years in business casie they are the best."}
{"text":"Same great food. Same great place for 100 years. Came here 30 years ago. Exactly the same today. Service is great. Food is great. Bring your cash thought. Nothing else accepted. And know what you want before you come in because the soups Nazi works here. No soap in the ladies room in the bathrooms are a little sketchy."}
{"text":"All I can say about Chuckbox is YUM. This is by far my favorite burger place in Arizona..maybe ever. I love the Tijuana Torpedo, which has a huge patty, green chiles and pepper jack cheese. I am a condiment whore, so having the option to pile my burger with whatever I want is a definite plus. By the time I'm done making my own burger, it's way too big to eat, so I have to dissect it into smaller portions..which is fun for me and highly entertaining for my friends.
The only reason it doesn't deserve my 5th star is for ambiance and speed. If you're in a hurry, chuckbox might not always be the best option. But if you're in the mood for a juicy well cooked burger then go there.. now.
and don't forget to stop by an ATM on the way, because this old school place only accepts cash."}
{"text":"I have a small appetite so I had the Little One burger with Chicken Tenders. Both were great and I would go back for the same thing for the rest of my semester at ASU"}
{"text":"My Co worker buzz starts popping off at the mouth about how great this place is and blah blah blah so I say, \"sure, let's try it...\" watching the guy cook the burgers is kind of cool if you like watching burgers cook for an eternity. He finally hands you your burger and you have to grab your own fries, assuming you ordered them, then go to the condiment bar and build it yourself....in one hand I think that's pretty cool because you get to be creative and you know it's going to taste right but on the hand, I think to myself, you pay a decent price for a burger and they're doing the least amount of work to it. Over all it was ok. I wouldn't seek this place out but I'd go if everyone else was going."}
{"text":"I didn't really notice until my girlfriend said something, but it's totally true:  We, being from Southern California, are used to having a burger joint, a greasy hole in the wall, everywhere you go.  If you go to the bank, there might be a little burger stand inside.  When you wash your car, reach your hand through the window and hot wax and grab a beefy little snack.  

In Phoenix, not so much.  There ARE burger places, but most often, they're a chain:  In N Out, Five Guys, Smash Burger, Fat Burger, Whataburger, etc.... and while they all vary from being pretty damn good to at least not embarrassing, it's just not the same as going to some little hidden gem, tucked between two buildings.  You have great, gourmet places like Fez, but, like I said, it's not the same.

To be honest, it's something that you really start to miss about \"home\" even though it hasn't been home for you in a long, long time.

I've ridden past the Chuck Box quite literally, hundreds of times.  It's right on my way home from work tucked somewhere into my peripheral vision and had been ignored by my brain for YEARS.  It wasn't until my sister recommend we pop in before a movie that I even knew it was there.  I'd seen the sign, but my brain never connected the dots.

This place does help to fill that void.  Not 100% but the burgers were really, really good and I love the set-up to actually see your burger get made.  Then you add your own garnishes with their floating island thing.  The price ain't too bad and the decor inside is warm and cozy.

In fact, I plan on hitting it up tonight."}
{"text":"Great backyard bbq tasting burger. I have the bacon cheeseburger. I can't wait to go back and try something else"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best flavored burgers I've ever had. Cooked over open flame, these charbroiled burgers are well worth the drive and the wait in line. 
The cooks keep the line moving and will take your order even when you are 10 people away from the grill. 
I got the double big one (2/3 lbs) with cheese and it was delicious.
They have burgers down pat. 
Also offer chicken breast (real ones, not patties) but seeing that the burgers are so good, I don't foresee trying the chicken anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers grilled over charcoal and dressed the way YOU want it at the self-service condiment bar. One of top 3 best burgers I've ever had, and full of smoky grilled flavor goodness.  Very reasonably priced!  I made my way by bus on a long layover at the airport, and it was well worth the trip and time spent."}
{"text":"This place is really good for a good burger and fries. I would recommend them but make sure you have cash because they don't accept debt or credit but they do have a ATM. It's better then you typical fast food restaurants or five guys."}
{"text":"Flame broiled burgers a must when your craving some flesh in Tempe. Stopped by a few times to the burger joint and have not been disappointed. Those flame grilled burgers really have a different flavor to them. Anytime to you get a fresh charcoal grilled piece of flesh you'll never go wrong. 


Now when you enter the building its kinda a cluster F@@K but once you get your order in its made fresh in front of your eyes. You have a bar to add all your flavors to it. Now that bar is kinda nasty but they maintain it so dong be to freaked out.

I'm sure you'll enjoy the burger experience here if not the In & Out burger is down the street on Rural Road."}
{"text":"One dude, no name tag busting his ass on a busy Saturday. Other dude \"norm\" reading newspaper. Food is always awesome."}
{"text":"Great Burgers, Great Fries, Cold Beer, Great Fountain Coke, Great Staff.  The Burgers are so good you will wonder why do I eat burgers anywhere else?  Fries are the perfect. They have a build your own burger bar.  Cash only, but they do have an ATM.  Hours are great because they are open late 11pm Mon-Sat.  Treat yourself today."}
{"text":"I'm came to visit a friend all the way from Northern California and came across this place 5 years ago.  This place has the most quintessential burger that I've ever tasted, and I've had a lots of them.  And I have to say I hardly give high praise to restaurants because I am very critical and picky.  Without being organic, grass fed, or whatever, this place is amazing.  The burgers are cooked right in front of you and they season it just perfectly.  The size of the patty is perfect where it's not too thick to be considered a steak much like that of gourmet burgers nor is it too thin like the lame 5 Guys chain.  The condiment bar has nice and fresh ingredients.  I also have a theory that it tasted so good because the place is so locked in.  I don't remember much windows in the building and there was a lot of smoke inside because the grill was inside.  Maybe that's what made it extra smoky tasting.  I remember the burgers being so good I walked 2.5 miles from my hotel to eat it for lunch after having had it for dinner the night before."}
{"text":"A friend tipped me off on this place. What a find!  

I had the Tijuana Torpedo....a large beef patty that appeared to be stuffed with jalapeno cheese, then topped with grilled chilies. It was fantastic!  I added cheddar to mine and some fixings from their excellent condiments bar.  

Their fries are nothing special...I'll have to try the onion rings next time.

The building is small and dark, but this isn't a place you go for ambiance...just grub down man!  

The guys behind the grill were very helpful and are efficient with their jobs. 

The greatest thing about this place is how cheap it is.  We were able to get EXCELLENT burgers, fries and drinks for what it would have cost to go to a chain joint and order their top end burger.  AMAZING!

WARNING:  CASH ONLY!! (but there is an ATM in the building)"}
{"text":"Simply the best burger in the Valley of the Sun. There is nothing else that can be said. Long live Juan!"}
{"text":"I didnt have high hopes for this place, mostly because of how the burgers look. I know its shallow but steered me clear of other spots where the \"locals\" thought was a good place but wasnt. I came here on an afternoon and was taken aback the moment I walked in. The vibe is family friendly but in a distorted way. There's lots of paraphernalia on the wall, but it also doesnt feel super homey. Almost cafeteria like. The servers are god hearted but dont necessarily seem cheery. The layout is not fancy and all of your ingredients in the condiments bar seem like a cookout. The chuckbox is no gimmick. It truly is alive, wood burning fire that sparks outside of the grill. Theres even signs alerting you of the sporadic dangers of the fire. Standing by the chuckbox feels like IM getting a sunburn because its so hot! 

Nothing is wrong with what I described, but it wasnt reassuring until i ate my food. I almost wished I ordered a double juan with cheese and bacon, but a single 1/3 patty with cheese got the job done. To me, this is how Burger King should taste, The meat was moist, had a nice, even charbroil flavor, and worked well with all the other ingredients. I like that they toast the buns as well. Its also really cheap to eat here. My sandwich was under 5 dollars. Its cash only but its not that big of a deal. You could pay with quarters from your car console if you needed to. 

Overall, I was highly satisfied with this traditional, no-non-sense burger. They are nothing special, but for their price, they are good."}
{"text":"These are some of the best burgers I've ever had. Nothing too complicated, just good ingredients and perfectly broiled. Really, the cooks here know how to get the burgers just right, so props to them. When I eat here I just get cheese and bacon on my burger, but there is a condiment bar so you can load up your burger with whatever at no extra charge. This place is seriously my favorite burger joint out there, It makes me want to move back to Tempe."}
{"text":"The food was good, but after I got my food I waited ten minutes to pay with no one in line. They're cash only because they claim cards take up too much time, but even when I had cash it took a while because they're low staffed."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers. Best fries. Attention to detail is second to none. The patties are grilled on coals and fries are done in small batches. Ruthlessly efficient too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the experience here.  Took some time to find parking nearby as I came during the dinner rush.  It was worth the wait.
They grill your burger right in front of you, which is a nice experience.   But more importantly, the burger tasted great!!!!   I had the Great Big One with jalapeno jack cheese, green chlies, and bacon.  It was very delicious.   I also had an order of jalapeno poppers.   Not too bad either - although they are obviously frozen and not made fresh.
Overall - I'd definately come back and recommend this place to others.  
Oh yeah - cash only, so bring some greenbacks."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Tempe. Great flavor, fresh bun, and the fries and cold beer are the perfect compliment. You get to build your burger like you want it. The line goes much quicker than it might appear. Highly recommend this burger joint to the world."}
{"text":"Some bs going on here. Came in here thought I have enough money. Total came to 25.98$ and I poured myself an ice tea. I didn't find that .98cents so I told the dude if be wants to remove the drink
He actually removed the drink and throw it away infront of me! That's some bs s*** yo!! Like you seriously that griddy? Never ever coming back! Infact I'm sitting here rn and have no desire to eat this burger."}
{"text":"I went here in November 2003 and was not impressed at all.  The place is dark, dirty and dingy...my burger was small, overcooked (and I like things well done!) and not all that impressive - taste wise.  The fries/onion rings were about average and the cost was not as cheap as many people would like you to believe.

Now, keep this in mind - I had yet to try In-N-Out Burger when I decided I did not like The Chuck Box...once I had In-N-Out, it was all over for The Chuck Box.

I have no idea why anyone would go here with In-N-Out only a short distance away.  In-N-Out tastes better, it's cheaper and definitely cleaner...I wonder what frequent visitors to the Chuck Box think about it being dark as hell...maybe to cover up the grime?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great for ASU students because its so close to campus and its pretty cheap. It has its own parking lot too, which makes getting there a breeze. The workers are always friendly the place has a very casual atmosphere. My absolute favorite is the guacamole bacon burger. Their fries are good too (extremely important if you ask me) although I have yet to try the wings. Tip- they only take cash! An ATM is available for use in the store."}
{"text":"The differentiate factor of this burger place to other restaurant that offer burger is in their method of cooking patties which is through grilling using charcoal. 

Some people might not like their patties because it is only grounded beef. Seasoned salt is the only seasoning added while the patties is grilled. However, since it was grilled with charcoal, the meat has better aroma. In addition, you can ask for extra toppings on your burger like grilled bacon stripped, just look at their menu for further extra toppings.
For the condiment, you are free to choose because they have a table full of condiment. 

The problem with chuck box is inconsistency due to who is in charge of cooking the patties. I cannot give this place more than 2 out of 5 because I have tasted better burger than their burger. Yet, I like to go to their place for lunch because I like charcoal aroma on my meat."}
{"text":"Seriously...this place can't be beat. 

You watch them grill the burger to your specifications...fresh meat...fresh condiment bar...deep fried sides (which you KNOW you love)...and usually some ASU chicks to check out as you stuff your face. 

BEST BURGER IN TEMPE for my money! LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE THIS PLACE! Been coming here for years and work definitely continue to do so!"}
{"text":"The Chuckbox is so tasty. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with a BACON WREATH and it was delicious. It's made to order on an open mesquite fire right in front of you so it tastes super fresh! They also have beer and wine if you're thirsty  and FYI it's cash only."}
{"text":"I think it's important to make a restaurant distinction here. If you appreciate dive-like settings with a) good food and/or b) good service, then you'll like Chuckbox. Oh, also being a meat-eater would help. If you're a sanitation-freak, I wouldn't come here.

Having eaten my lunch too early, I walked across the street from my office to the Chuckbox to give it a try. I stood in line and a nice man behind the grill took my order. A Big One, wheat bun. He then reaches into a bag o' buns and pulls it out with his bare hands, stabs it with burger and cheese identifying toothpicks, and tosses them on a flat grill surface to toast. Then he grabs his spatula and continues to flip.

The burgers move around the heat according to their done-ness, and the chicken goes where the burger was, the pineapple goes where the chicken was....get my point? If it wasn't cooked, maybe some would be worried about cross-contamination.

Anyway, the burger was AWESOME. I thought it was juicy and had good flavor. It looked like he sprinkled season salt on it--I could be wrong. I love a ton of condiments, so I really appreciated having a bar of them to myself. The lettuce was lacking--just a hacked up iceberg with some not so yummy parts, but everything else was what I wanted and more.

This place is all about expectations, and that's why I rambled so much about what some would love and what some would be terrified about. 

I'll come back and try the chicken."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place before a show at Gammage and I am so very glad I did.  Had a hankering for a flame grilled burger and some fried zucchini recently and I can tell you that I will be dreaming about them in the near future.  The set-up was pretty awesome, got there just in time to beat the rush.  I think we showed up around 6ish and had a few people in line ahead of us.  The ordering process was easy and the food was delicious.  VERY reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  I will definitely be back and it will be very soon."}
{"text":"really good charbroiled burger and cool old school place - but come on man canned briny green chilies really?!!
You in the SW where green chilies rule!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. I love that I get to dress my own. Kept the line moving too!  Fries were good though the portion is on the small side. Probably good that they don't serve the giant sizes some chains so..."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Unique environment that adds character to the meal. I come here everyday when in town for Spring Training."}
{"text":"I came here around lunch time and this place was packed. It is kind of \"cafeteria style\" where you place your order and then move down a line while you wait for them to cook up your burger. You move down a line and pick up your fries or other side items, then you get your burger and pay at the cashier. There is a condiments bar that features all the standard burger toppings. It can be a little chaotic trying to grab everything you want, and essentially make your burger. I felt really rushed since there was a ton of people there, and so it was kind of crazy getting everything. I would rather have the toppings already come on the burger instead of having to go through the hassle of doing it myself. The seating inside is somewhat limited, and very cramped. I liked this place overall though, and would definitely come back here. I thought that the burger was really excellent. The fries and fried zucchini were really good as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely great burgers. Onion rings were good.  Fries were not great, not sure how you can not make great fries. Love the condiment bar."}
{"text":"Slam Dunk!

I do NOT eat burgers.....

I ate here- the basic burger with cheese- it was great, tasted like a beef burger and my stomach is happy!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in az.  I don't throw that statement around, so try it for yourself.  The burger is cooked fresh, not frozen, over an open flame.  The onion rings are fresh and you can truly make it your way at the condiment bar.  Only bummer is that it's cash only, but nothing will keep me away from a chuckbox burger.  I wish they had drivethru."}
{"text":"Delicious and no BS. That's what I love about this place.

Know what your order is once you get in line -- there's no time to dilly dally (or the equivalent). The food is cooked for you right then and there on a grill. The spicy chicken breast sandwich is awesome. Burger, great. Has a self-serve condiment bar. Good prices too!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at The ChuckBox and definitely is gonna be the first of many! Sure I'm coming back. Have it your way !! The burgers are just good as they look."}
{"text":"Phenomenal burgers and an Arizona State University Sun Devil staple!

Perhaps no other restaurant in the Tempe area embodies ASU more than Chuck Box.  Directly across the street from campus, it has been serving up some of the best burgers around for decades. 

The atmosphere is simple and the burgers are great.  

To borrow a tagline from a commercial I saw years back advertising a product I don't remember, \"They're not great because they've been around for so long.  They've been around for so long because they're GREAT!\""}
{"text":"This is defintely an interesting place. To start, the place is cash only and it wasn't a friendly place to be at for my first time there. I had to yell to order at lunch which was fine, just didn't understand the atmosphere. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and jalapeño poppers. The burger was awesome and tasted like a real home cooked burger.a nice refreshing taste aside from the other fast food joints and bulk processed fooderies. My only issue would be that there wasn't enough uniqueness to their food. The jalapeño poppers were pretty good and enough to come by, but the flavor was definitely lacking. This is a place you could go every once in a while to grab a quick bite away from other places you'd normally eat at for lunch. Ps. Parking is horrendous."}
{"text":"Holy crap that's a good burger!

Hot damn them's good french fries!

I'll be a monkey's uncle, that's some quick service!

Unfortunately, the condiment bar kinda grossed me out, and they were out of Coke.  Who runs out of Coke?  Still, KILLER burger, AND cheap, AND just a short walk from the light rail stop at Veterans and College.  Couldn't have asked for a better place to stop and grab a bite on the fly."}
{"text":"Really good burgers here.  I had the Tijuana Torpedo 1/2 Burger with green chili and jalapeno jack cheese.  Delish!  They grill it over flaming hot coals right in front of you.  It gives it unique mouth watering taste. I added in blue cheese dressing at the condiments bar to it.  Fresh.

The Sonoran Draft Root Beer is very good.  Comes in a cold mug.  I don't normally drink soda pop but occasionally I will drink this.

Cash only. ATM inside.

I love coming here when I'm in the mood for a really good burger."}
{"text":"This place makes a darn good burger.  I went here with a friend a couple days ago for the first time.  We went around 12:30 and didn't have any trouble finding parking but it was Memorial Day so there were less people around.  The seats inside were all full so that's usually a good sign.  We waited in line to order - they cook your food right there in front of you.  We actually saw them lift up the grill and stir up the charcoal underneath - pretty cool.  Burgers were made exactly as we ordered and they were legit!  Absolutely delicious - best burger I've had in quite a while.  They only take cash so be prepared.  (If you're not prepared they do have an ATM inside.)  They have a condiment bar after you pay which is where you add whatever you want to your burger (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc).  We sat outside on the patio (they have misters so it wasn't overly hot) and enjoyed our burgers.  It was a really good lunch and under $10 for the burger and fries.  Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"The best chicken box in Tempe guys great foods The best service good price great clean food"}
{"text":"So tasty! I've been here a few times and I'm always happy. They have a vegetarian option(It's cooked on the same grill as meat) and it's mighty tasty! They have pretty good options if you ask me. The only downside is it's no cash, BUT they conveniently have an atm inside. Try if you're in the mood for classic picnic burgers."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great local burger joint, this is the place for you.  Make sure to bring cash, though, and a loud voice to yell your order in from the back of the line. 10/10 would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Phoenix is known for many restaurants, but how many are considered a part of Tempe history?  Then again, is nearly 40 years considered history?  For students at ASU, it sure is!  It's more than double many of their ages.  

There are some parking spots though I've always found it easier to park elsewhere and just walk over.  The moment you walk into the restaurant, you instantly notice one long line that looks like it will take forever to order and receive your food.  The Chuck Box knows how to handle a big line.  They take orders as you stand a bit back into the line and keep the line moving along.  As you walk up, you get your drink and by that time, your food is already ready for you.  Looks can be misleading, and they certainly are in this case.  

There is a very nice condiment bar that everyone seems to enjoy after you get your food and leave the line.  It's nice to personalize the burgers, chicken, fries, or whatever else of the simple menu you choose to order.  There are little ones (burgers), big ones, and then great big ones.  I've never gone hungry with a big one or a double little one.  They're all tasty no matter what you order!

It's hard to imagine that this classic restaurant has been rejected by Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  That's the story around Tempe.  Perhaps it has to do with with them only accepting cash?  Or their choice in furniture (log ends as chairs), which I personally appreciate?"}
{"text":"This is hands down, the best burger restaurant I've been to. The BEST burger I have eaten. 

You go in, order the size of your patty, and decide if you want one or two patties. You chose your bread and your cheese. Done... for now. You watch the patty being cooked right in fornt of you. 

You pay (cash only), take your burger to the ingredient table. Then you put in the ingredients that you want into your burger. Whatever you want, and how much you want of it... but play fair!

I used to go here on a weekly basis when I lived close to it, now I live further, but I still make sure that I visit my favorite burger place ever. 

200% recommended!"}
{"text":"Charcoal grilled grub, small digs with old crates to sit on while you stuff your face, what's not to love about this place. I ordered a Tijuana Torpedo Burger w/fries and a Sonoran draft root beer, also got a Double Big One w/pepper jack chz to-go. My only knock is that the college SJWs working there are useless. Luckily the man working the grill runs the show. I'll be back, I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"A step back in time when MTV had just kicked off and we would stop in for a burger and a pitcher before class.  Well a ga-zillion years later the burgers are good and Norm the fry guy...cashier guy is a douche!

Its hard to dis on the Chuck but good lord, throw me a bone guys how-a-bout at least some semblance of customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burger places I have had the privilege to eat at. The building/atmosphere is a little quirky, but it's what makes chuck box the burger joint that it is. Considering the amount of food and the fact that the food is fresh/made to order, the prices are very affordable. You get to see your food made in front of you, which I always like. There is a condiment bar, which is nice because you can customize your burger. This place is cash only, so bring money. They do have an ATM if you forget. If you go to ASU or live in Tempe, this place is a must-go in rider to complete your experience!"}
{"text":"hamburgessa heaven.  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.  Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant"}
{"text":"The burger patty while thin was still juicy. I loved the condiment bar, put exactly what you want and how much you want of the burger. Tasted great. The fries were just average and the seating outside doesn't work well with shorts or skirts as it's a tree stump."}
{"text":"Chuck box getting only 4 stars is total BS. I have been going for over 20 years. Never has the food been less then excellent."}
{"text":"Yum!  How are there not more burger joints like this one?  Tell your order to the chef, watch him cook it for you.  Eat your delicious burger, or whatever beautiful piece of meat you choose, and enjoy their onion rings.  Beer+.  Food, done perfect!  Tvs.  I'm happy.  Thank you chuckbox!"}
{"text":"I like burgers... a lot, and I eat them wherever I go!

I tried the Chuck Box because of YELP reviews, and I can't express enough appreciation for those YELPers who turned me on to this place.  FANTASTIC burger and rings.   I had the Tijuana Torpedo -- a most tasty concoction of wood-grilled meat, spicy cheese, and green chile pepper.  I've had many similar burgers but none quite so tasty.  I wish I had more frequent opportunity to be in Tempe."}
{"text":"Well I have yet to have the food but this past holiday weekend the wife and I just wanted to scope the place out. The smell was overwhelming and they make everything to order right on the grill. I can't wait to try the chicken sandwich and when I do I will update this review. Now be advised they only take cash and the parking could be a bit tricky. They draw tons of foot traffic because this establishment is located right in the heart of Tempe and ASU students I imagine are in abundance. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here with my dad since I was a kid.
On a recent trip to AZ I went here with a friend from high school and my little one. Everything was exactly as I remembered it-awesome! Love the do-it-yourself fixings and the whole experience is one to savor. Will continue to come back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is pretty delish. I always liked their burgers when I ate meat. I wanted to write this review because I was EXTREMELY impressed with their veggie burger, and when I looked at reviews myself, there weren't any pics of the veggie burgers.

I had asked what was in it, and the employee didn't really seem to know and said \"carrots\". I was worried because I've had some funky veg burgers with shreds of carrots in it. Anyways, I was definitely worried. Buuuuut when I got my burger and bit in, it was delicious!! It had a really nice faux meat taste, rather than that vegetable taste. My partner actually liked my burger more than his real meat one! We were both really impressed with it.

Plus the fries are always on point."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed this place during my time in Tempe. I do have to say that the place has a unique Western style, and that I liked how you can watch them make the food as you wait in line. They have a nice system for you to put different types of condiments (of your preference). That being stated,  I felt that it was a standard solid burger, and is a good place to be at to hang with some friends for lunch."}
{"text":"I have never had a better burger than the burger at Chuck Box. I try so hard to recreate the awesomeness that is the combination of the lean 80/20 beef (bought from a local Scottsdale butcher, and hand pounded using old Mexican preparations), crisp greens (or grilled green chillies/pineapple), and lightly toasted bun; but my efforts are futile. It cannot be done. I have to admit, I worked at this run-down looking little shack, but it wasn't until I recognized the \"flavor\" that I knew I had to be part of a legend. Don't expect a cute little smile when you walk in the door, and don't wear your sunday best. Rest assured that anything you order will be the best you'd ever have. A guide to ordering at The Chuck Box: White or wheat? Chicken (Plain, Hot n' Spicy, BBQ, or Teriyaki) or Beef (Little Once (1/5lb), Big One (13/lb), or Great Big One (1/2lb))? Cheese (American, Swiss, Pepperjack, or Cheddar)? Bacon? Green Chile? Pineapple? Guac? (believe it or not you then dress it up yourself at the best condiment bar). And on the SIDE: Fries, Onion Rings, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Jalapeno Poppers, Chicken Strips, Chili? ......Man I want some right now...."}
{"text":"This is arguably the best burger joint in the entire state of Arizona. They use fresh meat and vegetables. The only thing I don't like as much, is the condiment island which can sometimes be a little messy. Other than that it is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The burgers remind me of Micnics, remember Micnics?

This is what I don't like about the place:
1)  standing in a long ass line and having someone yell at me to yell my order back at them
2) the buffet of fixings that allows you, flies and everyone else and their filthy fingers to make their own burger
3) its dirty
4) I smell like a grease ball when I leave
 
I want to kick back and relax when I eat a meal, this place is too much work for too little pay off."}
{"text":"!!! ~ CASH ONLY ~ !!!

This place is an absolute HOLE IN THE WALL - but in the good kind of way.  There is no diet menu here.  The Chuck Box is for Carnivores!

Very casual, very open, great outside seating and perfect atmosphere.  they sell beer to help wash down your tasty burger.  I'm hooked!

Parking is limited and the lunch crowd borders on almost our of control.  Get there early!"}
{"text":"Pros
-Pretty great food, great burgers
-fair pricing
-cool condiment bar

Cons
-cash only
-would like fresh french fries, zucchini, and mushrooms instead of reheated pre-made frozen stuff
-awkward way of having to yell to order from the middle of the line rather than the front when you get there"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Lonely Island - Dick in a Box)

You know you've been there for such a long long time
And now I'm ready to wait for it in the line
Well, you know it's Lunch time and my mouth is open wide
Hope you gonna give me something tasty so you know what's on my mind

A burger real special, so take off the bun
I'll take a look inside it's at the Chuck Box!
It's at the box

Not gonna get me a Burger King
That sort of burger don't mean anything
Not gonna get me a In-and-Out
Cause, you've got my shining Yelp star

Not gonna get me a Mckey burger
I guy like me needs something real
I wanna get me something that'll hit my heart
Something special man!

It's at the Chuck Box
It's at the Chuck Box man
It's at the Chuck Box
Ohh, It's at the Chuck Box man

Where should I start!?  Hmmm...

Well I was told to come here years ago from a friend, but never traveled my way down to the Mills Ave. much anymore since I'm way past my 20's.  However, it was always on my mind and now; Bam! I did it!  

The Chuck Box I guess has been around for ages, not my age apparently.  The place itself is a dive.  Made out to look like it's right out of a pioneer wagon with boxes as chairs.  Seating is limited so arrive and be prepared to wait or pickup and go.  The burgers are made from scratch literally.  It's a \"build your own burger\" place so add toppings by asking the chef.  Overall, the burger is perfect.  Best firewood grill burger I've had!  Mesquite firewood is what they used. The burger is nice and juicy with a smokey scent!  I went lightly on the toppings since the burger itself is so big!  Ordered me a side of zucchini fries and I'm golden!  

In the end, I can be a burger snob, but The Chuck Box impressed me.  I don't care for \"build your burger\" places, but I'll let this one pass with an A grade. - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Awesome laid back atmosphere with made-to-order burgers! The condiment station makes it easy to design your perfect burger to pair up with the onion rings, jalapeño poppers or zucchini, which are some of my favorites. Give it a try, and don't forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"Best Burgers Period.

I no longer order burgers anymore due to them never standing up to a Chuck Box burger. I always get a little one and I can barely finish it but I push myself every single time because they are worth the pain of over eating. The onion rings are also a must. I still need to try their chicken sandwich but it is just so difficult due to their burgers being that good. Honestly I don't know how many times I can say this but they are the BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard A LOT about the Chuck Box over the years, so I finally decided it was time I gave it a go.

Atmosphere-wise, nothing to write home about. It has a similar vibe to the Original Hamburger Works, with a wagon full of condiments and a similar order, watch them grill your burger, pay setup. The place looks old, which I guess is part of it's appeal. They only accept cash for payment, which is kind of lame in this day and age.

The burger itself was good. Good like a home-cooked burger on the grill would be. For $8 and some change, I'm not in a rush to hurry back here, but I won't say that I'll never return. Overall, I just didn't feel it lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Family member LOVED the the burger. I liked it but felt it's more of a place you to eat at opposed to getting to go (which is what we did). Next time we are eating there. Burger was cooked a harder than I would have liked. I believe I probably could have had them take if off the fire sooner but I was busy boxing up the burger fixings. Onion rings were good but only one serving so don't plan on really sharing with anyone. Lol all in all great experience. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The best burger I had at Phoenix... Must visit place for burger lovers. The ambience is also awesome. Dont forget to take some cash (They dont accept cash)."}
{"text":"Chuck Box burgers are hands down one of the best burgers in town.  The place is very dive-y but the food cannot be beat.  Beware that this joint is CASH ONLY, although an ATM is right by the door.  Burgers (and other assorted items) are cooked right in front of you after you order on a charcoal grill.  After your food is ready you are free to help yourself to the condiment bar.  There's also plentiful outdoor seating which is great for people watching!"}
{"text":"Legit yumminess. Tijuana torpedo is my pick and if i need a change i do the chicken breast."}
{"text":"One serious burger. The chuck box is an experience  in itself. From Juan asking whatcu want the second you walk in the door to paying only with cash, this place rocks. As an ASU alumni, I went here all the time when I was on campus with friends. Occasionally on the weekends we'd have beer and burgers here, can't be beat. The line an get pretty long but that's because the food is good. If you order chicken, expect it to take a while longer than the burgers, and get out of line but keep an eye on it. I read a review from someone calling the place dirty, which is funny because they must not get out much. The place is not dirty, it is old and authentic, and clean as it is going to get. If you're in Tempe and hungry and have cash and want a burger, come here. It's not fast but it's delicious."}
{"text":"Only Restaurant with a burger named after me... \"The Great Big One\" get you one!! Good food cool people!"}
{"text":"Best Burger on Earth.  Yep, it's a dive and yep, it's a dark dingy place. But I've never had an overcooked or under cooked burger.  They've always made my perfectly and the orders always come out quickly.  

Bring cash and walk away very full."}
{"text":"Best burger you've ever had in your life. If you disagree, you either know something I don't or your palate has no business writing reviews here."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this spot. It's a simple, down to earth, no frills burger joint. But at the same exact time, it's mind-blowingly amazing!! It's constantly busy so give yourself some time when you decide to head there. You enter, and there's usually a pretty hefty line. But be patient an just wait. It'll all be well worth it. When you decide which burger you're going for, they'll ask you on what kind of bun and how you'd like your party cooked. They charbroil their burgers made to order the good ole fashion way - over an open flame. Also, they're CASH ONLY. So make sure you've got some one you. But if not, there's an ATM inside. All the condiments are presented to you \"salad bar\" style and they also make some amazing fried zucchini bites and onion rings. If you're craving a great burger, give this place a try. You're welcome. ;)"}
{"text":"one of the best burgers in az, just get the big juan and thank juan after! order it, then they grill it and makes your mouth water waiting n watching. then pile your own stuff on at the bar."}
{"text":"A Sun Devil staple! Located just across the street from ASU's campus, this place is always busy. Burgers grilled to order with a well stocked  and clean condiment bar. Grilled peppers, guac or bacon. Lots of yummy options here.  Yes, you may leave with the smokey aroma of the grill but that's just going to make everyone else jealous. This place is consistently good and one of the few places on University or Mill to survive the standard turnover rate of the area!  That should tell you something. 

Tip - Don't forget they are cash only!"}
{"text":"Try the big Juan! This is the staple burger of ASU. Don't let the shack like appearance of the restaurant fool you!"}
{"text":"Another epic  Tijuana torpedo. Always a great burger here.  Been enjoying Chuck Box burgers since I worked at the one that used to be in Scottsdale many years ago."}
{"text":"The most simple, basic burgers you can think of.
I mean that in the absolute best way. Sort of a 'salad-bar-build-your-own' feel to it.
They give you the meat of your choice, the cheese of your choice, and a bun, and let you do what you want to it.
Cash only, so heads up on that.
Delicious."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers I've ever had. Gets busy during the school year, so I try to go at night. Everything on the menu it's fantastic. My personal favorite is the Tijuana Torpedo. The green peppers are incredible with the cheese and it's so good that the condiments are made into a side salad instead of going on the burger. I would recommend this to every burger enthusiast."}
{"text":"This place is iconic ASU! As soon as you get there you can just feel the classic vibe! The building has clearly been there for a long time and with good reason. The food is fantastic and the staff is nothing but excellent. I highly recommend trying the fried mushrooms! 
Great when my dad was a student and great now as a student. A must if you go to ASU or even just visiting."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with our family. This place is nothing fancy, but the burgers are excellent. You sit on wooden boxes for chairs. The building looks like a dumpy shack. The burgers are cooked over an open grill using real charcoal briquettes. The staff here is very friendly. Wished I lived closer to the place so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"Famed for their burgers, they also grill the best chicken sandwiches I have eaten in my life. So dang succulent. The university-adjacent location means that parking can be difficult, waits can be lengthy, and seating can be impossible. Stop in when they're not too busy however, and you'll be glad you did. Pro tip: they will add a grilled green chile or a grilled pineapple to any sandwich! Cash only."}
{"text":"At The Chuckbox, you are in the grill. You are a part of it, well at least that's what it feels like in the summertime coming here. I was reminded of an old tinder pile of wood, in case you were looking for the place and could not find it. I honestly do not know how they have managed to not go up in flames yet in all of the time they have been here. They have misters outside if you want to brave the desert heat and sit on the patio.

Why would I review a place that has over 100 reviews? because then you can read a recent review instead of one from 2009. I am a vegetarian so I don't know if my review is baloney or what, but I assure you my gardenburger was the bomb. Draft beer anyone? My partner is a meat eater/carnivore and he assured me his burger was seared perfectly on the outside and very juicy on the inside. I could not for the life of me get him to shut up about the damn burger. I tried talking about musicians, porn, firearms, all to no avail! 

I really like the condiment station where you can do it yourself and pile on whatever it is that you pile on your burger. I feel like I walked into old west with hammered copper top tables and wooden crate seating. You can watch your burger being grilled and it is not frozen beef but fresh chuck. The fries were good and although I did not get the onion rings, they looked excellent on other people's plates. Just make sure you sit next to the air conditioner."}
{"text":"I went to ASU and I never ate here. So I was probably the only student who didn't follow the tradition. 

Today it was super busy. I came here during the lunch hour. I had the bacon cheeseburger. You call out your order while you wait since the line is so long. The burger was a decent size. This place is cash only but there is a ATM on sight. What was cool is they have a condiments bar for your burger. I thought this was neat. My bacon cheeseburger was pretty good. I ate the whole thing. Prices were decent too. I wouldn't get the onion rings again. They were just okay. There was a man making sure the tables were clean too. 

So my cherry was finally popped for this place. I will  go again for round 2"}
{"text":"The burger was good and I liked how they had a buffet table full of toppings and condiments where you can customize your burger. However, it being my first time there the place was a little intimidating so one tip to newbies out there is to not stand in front of the menu because that is the line. Right when you walk in, the menu is above on the right. Make sure to walk further into the restaurant so that the worker knows you aren't ready to order and so that you won't block the way of other customers who are trying to get in line."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come if you are in the mood for a homemade-tasting burger. They cook over a large charcoal fire, making it taste like something my dad would cook up in the backyard on his grill, but BETTER! So delicious and very decently priced. 

Make sure you know what you want when you go inside...they will ask for your order even if you are far back in the line. They move very quickly here!"}
{"text":"Minus 1 star for not taking debit/credit cards

Tasty burgers, fun atmosphere, cold beer.

Yay!"}
{"text":"You're going to leave smelling like smoke but also feeling very satisfied. When I was visiting from NY, this place was recommended by a local, and it was definitely the write choice. The burgers were fresh and had a backyard BBQ feel to them. I ended up ordering another one after my first and even though I could barely move, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I tried the Tijuana Torpedo here and wow, probably one of the best burgers I've tasted. Everything is made to order, staff is cool, and just the atmosphere is completely laid back. They do only accept cash though just to make sure there are no long waits."}
{"text":"Pretty good basic burger, add green chiles to make it a great burger. I highly recommend this place & there burgers. But it's cash only so hit the atm first."}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is a Tempe staple that's been going strong for 45 years.  I remember eating here in elementary school and loving it.  Hubby was craving a burger and I thought this place might be good to revisit after all those years.   It still looks exactly the same as it always has and the burgers are still delicious.  You can really taste the wood coal in the burgers.  Anywhere I can add as many pickles to a burger as possible is a great place in my book.  Hubby was super happy with his burger and frosted glass of root beer.  If you're looking for a simple and tasty burger at a good price, get your cash together and try this place."}
{"text":"Chuck box has the best cheese burger & fries next to WhataBurger. Love there grilled burgers, just like the back yard BBQ. Just someone else us cooking!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl with my parents.  They have the best hamburgers here that you dress up the way you want.  You can choose from a little one (regular size) and big one (big) and a great big one (HUGE).  Of course whatever condiments you want too.  They have seating outside and the whole place has an old west feel to it.  They only accept cash, but it is totally worth taking a trip to the ATM. Oh yeah, get the zuchini, soooo GOOD!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town????? Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with other Yelpers. I've stopped by a couple times since I stumbled onto this place and I'm a fan! I will quickly refer anyone here for one of their delicious hamburgers. A couple options in patty size, cheese experience and additional toppings on the grill. A couple fried vegetable options to choose from, zucchini & fries hit the spot for me. A full condiment bar to top off your burger to its perfection. Not much more you can ask for.....

FYI-They only take CASH so bring sum chedda. They do have an ATM tho in case you forget. Also, good food can sometimes equal a bit of a long line to get up to the grill and with being smack dab in the middle of ASU this place can get packed. Have a prospect grab you some seats is my recommendation while you drool in line for a delicious bite to eat"}
{"text":"I have got to say that this is my favorite place for a burger period just make sure you've got cash although they do have an ATM on site. I love everything about this place: the atmosphere, location, food, and the people that work there. This is the kind of place that doesn't try to be something it's not. I've never had a burger that wasn't incredible and I absolutely love watching the guy behind the grill make the burgers.

If you're looking for a great burger with that classic charcoal taste this is absolutely the best place to go. You have to check it out."}
{"text":"unpretentious dining area with really juicy mesquite-grilled hamburgers. cash only. dont expect any veggies or any healthy sides other than guacamole"}
{"text":"Wow. You know, I already have a favorite burger joint in town, and it's not The Chuck Box. I went here tonight because it was it's a few miles closer than my normal favorite and wasn't up for the drive. I'm glad I did. I was a bit skeptical of how my burger would turn out because I saw it being cooked, and in my foolish opinion I thought it was overcooked. Nonetheless, I made my burger up the way I like it (they have a condiment bar, as I'm sure you've read), with tomatoes, ketchup, mayo, and lettuce. When I took my first bite, I got the charred edges of the burger, but also a mouthful of delicious beef, and realized it wasn't burnt, the cook meant to do that. The patty wasn't quite as thick as I prefer, but the flavor was excellent. 5 stars, and a very close second for best burger in town."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best BURGER in Tempe! Cash only is probably the only negative"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fast burger then this is not your place.  They cook the burgers right in front of you so it takes a while.
The food was good, the ambiance was rustic.  The taste was good, although it would have been nice to get a higher quality bun. I felt that the customer service was ok, not great.  I loved that they have a condiment bar.
I wouldn't go our of my way to go there, but if in the area I would go back.
TIPS: go during odd times as rush hour is packed and don't forget your cash.  No cards accepted."}
{"text":"I think the burger in chuck box is very delicious. In addition, the fruit and some topping are fresh. You can get free drink refills. You should try it."}
{"text":"This place is so good! It doesn't look like much, but it is! You stand in line, order, watch your food cook and pick up your food, all before you get to the register and pay. There's a big middle bar of toppings. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger which was delicious. Also, I got an order of onion rings which were AMAZING. Lightly battered, not overly greasy, they were cooked perfectly. I would've ordered 2 orders of them had I known they were so good. The pricing is also very reasonable but it is cash only."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town, better read the menu you get here. The line gets big and the order taker is ready for you to yell at him with your choice of burger. Well worth the price and wait."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. A real Tempe staple. I love this place so much. Grew up on it. If you are in town visiting, Chuck box is a must stop. Great veggie burgers too if you ate vegetarian like my friend."}
{"text":"The Juan and only! Head toward ASU/Mill Ave and bask in the Mesquite Grilled splendor. 

The Chuck Box is truly a long standing and radiant gem in the valley. I've been going here since the mid-80's when I was at ASU. Very little has changed and that's a good thing.. a very good, deep-down thing. 

This uncomplicated burger experience will leave you satisfied and pining for your next trip... as it has for me over the last 40 years. The are certain foods in the valley that would be unmistakable in a blind taste test. A Chuck Box burger is one such food. The flavor of the meat, cooked over mesquite, is exceptional. 

Advice: 

It's a cash-only establishment, so bring some... or pay the ATM fee.

Great portions cooked on a grill over a mesquite pit for an unbelievable combination of charring and wood smoke that makes me drool just thinking about it.
Ambiance, decor: well, pull up a barrel stool and put the burger in your mouth and tell me that stuff matters.
On a personal note, I've been eating at this place since the mid 80's, nothing much has changed, and I'm glad.   If you want the process at 5-guys, or the posh of Fudd Ruckers, go eat at one of those places so I don't have to wait as long for my burger."}
{"text":"My first Chuck Box experience was in 1989.  It is good to see a business that has maintained through the \"redevelopment\" of the area around ASU.

Fast-forward to my return to the Valley in 2011...and in cruising through my old stomping grounds, observing that ALL the favorite spots (Mama's Pizzaria, Ozzie's Warehouse, 6 East Lounge and Long Wongs) are no more.  The Chuck Box, complete with rusty-appearing roof, still stands, though.  It is gratifying to see the puffs of smoke from the grill.

On walking in, the decor has not changed.  The tables still have copper tops, and when you sit inside, you are sitting on wooden crates.  The condiment bar is certainly one of the best I have seen in a burger joint.  It makes customizing the favored double burger with cheese and bacon SO easy!

The prices are good, the beer is cold, and the onion rings are certainly up to par.  The only thing that has changed (and maybe it is because I am 20+ years beyond my first visit) is that students seem to get faster service."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for an appoint men on 10Feb, and I was going to meet a friend the night before, she suggested the Chuck box, for both it's price and location to her home.  (She is also a former ASU student,)
I liked the building as soon as we pulled up.
Inside was a wood fired grill  I ordered my Great Big Bacon Cheese Burger.  It took a while to make, but they cooked it it right in front of me.  I ordered my onion rings crispy, and the cook shouted to the fry cook.
I had my drink onion rings and burger, now over to the condiment bar to get topping for the burger.
My friend suggested we sit outside, as it was warm night in Tempe.  
It didn't take long to chow down on a very good burger and rings.  I will be back the next time in the metropolitan area!"}
{"text":"So I was back at the Chuck Box and I noticed something I had not before...

Most restraunt bathrooms have a sign that says: \"Employees must wash hands\" and I have a standard joke about what a pain it is to have to wait for an employee to come by to wash my hands, I'm perfectly capable of washing my hands ha ha ha. 
But the, otherwise unattractive bathrooms at the Chuck Box have a clearly worded sign that says: \"All Employees must wash their hands before returning to work!\"

Good burgers! Grammatically clear sanitary signage! What's not to like!"}
{"text":"Just a regular good burger you can make at home, wasn't too impressed. Not saying it was bad just wasn't to die for like I expected"}
{"text":"How do my husband and I convince ourselves that visiting family in PHX will be painless? We fool ourselves with a fire grilled burger and an ice cold beer at the Chuck Box. 

It is a classic burger, experience and I'll always pay a visit before I say hi to mom."}
{"text":"our incredible light rail adventure on v-day headed east after a stop in central phoenix. yay for me! that means lunch at the chuckbox for the first time in at least 7 years, probably longer. 

we could smell it from a quarter mile away. we could almost taste it when we  got to the familiar wooden patio. and we couldn't get it fast enough once we ordered ... damn, dude, we  l o v e  the chuckbox - maybe even more today than when we went to asu. juicy burgers, tasty chicken, thick bacon and a (kinda sketchy) condiment bar with lots o' fun stuff to class up your burger with. this place is all around good. you just can't say enough nice about it. they've got a system, and the system works. you'll get what you order and it will be super fresh and tasty. i can't give them less than 5 stars. i love you chuckbox. i will be back to see you again soon."}
{"text":"We love this place for a tasty burger and fries or onion rings. Add their local root beer to wash it all down! The place is unpretentious and is interested in serving you good food. If you want to he catered to or sit in a brightly lit and romantic place, go somewhere else. Otherwise just enjoy this ASU area classic and bring cash or your ATM card to get cash as it is a cash only establishment."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious. Popped in during lunch to satisfy a craving and was not disappointed! Bring cash! There's an atm here with $2.00 fee. You have to try if in Tempe."}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is an excellent place to go to for anyone looking to grab a quick, yet completely satisfying and incredibly tasty burger. With a variety of sizes to choose from it will surely fulfill anyone's hunger, no matter how big your appetite is. 

Also, the food is prepared in front of you, so you can watch the entire process. 
Minus one star for having a rude and uncharismatic server with absolutely no personality. But all in all, great food, great place."}
{"text":"While the interior appears to follow the name of what you would expect a chuck box to look like, I wasn't at all thrilled with the wait, or the product.
I went with a hot dog (yes I know it's not their specialty) but really a hot dog served on a hamburger bun? That info should be disclosed before you order. Why would I want a long hot dog on a round bun? Not at all appetizing either and the fries needed salt. A popular condiment that should be cooked into the food.
You wait in line to order which can take a while, pay cash only and condiments are on a salad bar type table. 
Hubby had a burger which was great in flavor but unspectacular otherwise. 
I think the biggest draw for this place is the location and price. It's worth going to but be careful. Hubby also almost choked on 2 toothpicks that were somehow in his sandwich. He didn't want to say anything about it so it never got mentioned but first impressions mean a lot."}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is one of the best burgers you will find in the Phoenix metro. 

The style is kick back, with wood chips on the floor and a pick-up counter, so you can never feel \"too scrubby\" to go to the Chuck Box. And the condiment bar is top notch, which is always major points for me. If anyone has been to the Original Hamburger Works near downtown, they know what I'm talking about, and this one is comparable. 

Fantastic hangover food and really good the rest of the time."}
{"text":"I finally made it to The Chuck Box and I am very glad I did! Like other reviewers stated, the ordering/paying system is screwed up, but ultimately, I'm here for a delicious burger and fries! Make that a Double Big Burger with bacon and American cheese. It took a little while, but good things come to those who wait. And man, was it good. I'm ranking it at either second or third in my Best Burgers of Phoenix list. The Chuck Box grills their burgers over an open flame, giving it a great flavor.

I get people's issue with a fixin's bar, but when I was there it was in decent shape. I'm willing to forgo my slight germaphobia in order to get whatever I want, the way I want it, on my burger. Also, the midwesterner inside me loves the fact that they offer free ranch dressing for all your French fry dipping pleasure. (Please note: I'm not at all from the midwest)

I went with a friend after a day trip to Sedona for some hiking. We both heard great things and wanted to give it a try. After an impromptu decision to head directly to Chuck Box, we made a second impromptu decision to make it a Tempe burger tour and give Lobby's a try as well. Both were great, but I'm giving the nod to Chuck Box, while my friend voted for Lobby's."}
{"text":"Ventured here for lunch  today with my good friend Austin. Another successful lunch! 

The Chuck Box knows exactly who their customers are, exactly what they offer and they execute with precision. Charcoal grilled burgers, fries or onion rings and a condiment bar with the essentials to finish off your meal how you like it. A home bbq weekend when ever you're in the mood.

It's simple, it's effective and above all, it's good.

Their cash only policy is a minor annoyance that you quickly forget after sinking your teeth into the fresh-off-the-grill meal."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get it. 
Long lines, weird service, and literally store bought buns out of a plastic bag. The burgers are okay, but nothing that great. It tastes like a typical 4th of July bbq. 
That said, the onion rings are pretty darn good, and the smell really does draw you in."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Be prepared for a bit of a wait because they start cooking your burger when you order it. You can stand in line and watch them as they grill up your delish meal. Oh and be prepared, this is a cash only restaurant! They make up for this slight inconvenience with great food and a condiment bar. That's right, you can put what ever you want onto your burger!"}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is dark. Very dark. Even in the day time it feels like night in that place. This doesn't help when it comes time to put condiments on one's burger. I am skeptical as to how well the condiment bar looks in good light, which may explain the choice of lighting. Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.

Every time I go to the Chuck Box I feel as if there is going to be something wrong with the food, and this something is being concealed from me by the lack of lighting. Yet, each time I go I have a delicious veggie burger or grilled chicken sandwich. My friends have also enjoyed \"real\" burgers there as well. 

Maybe it's best they keep the lights dim, but the food tastes so good there may be nothing to fear after all."}
{"text":"a favorite spot when visiting ASU.
great burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"For a burger joint that caters to the local college kids in Tempe, this place is above average. You should go to The Chuck Box just to experience the way they cook their burgers in front of you while you're in line. 

Also above average: the price. Expect to spend a little more than the average burger when you come here, but it's well worth it. And considering the venue is local, it's an even better excuse to get your booty here on your lunch break."}
{"text":"We all have our favorite burger haunts, and the Chuck Box is a favorite of mine, especially since it was one of the first, well, dives I ever went to for a burger.  I finally got a chance to go back there after several years' absence.

I'm sure that when it was built (which I don't know when that was, the Box was a veteran burger joint when our family moved to Arizona in the early 80s), it was on the north side of Arizona State University, but as ASU has grown, it's probably more accurate to say that it's now kind of in the middle of ASU.

In any case, the Chuck Box is basically a burger shack, emphasis on the shack. It's old gnarled wood, and it sports a definite sloppiness in construction that's the hallmark of a \"shack\". Actually, sometime in the 80s I remember the place had a bit of a makeover, in which they added some windows (greatly increasing the light level), added some ventilation (greatly reducing the smoke level from the grill), and removed a lot of the accumulated crap on the walls and ceiling. I think I liked it better before, but I'm not a building code enforcer, either.

But, even though the random mementos on the wall are interesting (including such oddities as a picture of Ronald McDonald signed \"Even Ronald likes to go to the Box!\"), the real features of the Chuck Box are the several foot long charcoal grill, several Frialators, and a big giant condiment bar (that says \"Have it your way... but play fair!\"). Basically, it's all about having a grilled sandwich, with the main features being the \"Big One\" 1/3 lb burger, and the \"Great Big One\" 1/2 lb burger. They also have a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches and the like. All the burgers are available on white or wheat buns, with several cheeses (including pepper jack), bacon, or even fried peppers.

Finally, you can round out your burger with the free condiments bar. Nothing terribly elaborate here, but it's got a decent array of your basic burger toppings (onions, pickles, pickled jalapenos, mustard, etc).

Pros:

1. This is a seriously good charbroiled burger done right. I opted for my normal, a Big One with swiss and grilled peppers, with a bunch of onions, mustard, and jalapeno piled on.

2. Free well-stocked condiment bars should be the norm at any burger joint...

3. The fries (a.k.a. Chuckbox Potatoes) are quite good here, with a nice crunchy exterior and a mashed-potato-like interior. Seriously, I like the fries here.

Cons:

1. Being in the middle of ASU, parking can be an issue, and on occasion, it's pretty crowded.

2. If it's not sunny out, this place can be danker than Moe's Tavern.

All-in-all, I was glad to see that one of my favorite burgers for over 20 years is still a solidly dependable burger."}
{"text":"Completely over rated.  I've been there about 7 or 8 times and never had a fantastic burger.  It's not bad.......it's just not great.  Maybe it's because my childhood was never a memorial day BBQ kind of childhood, that I think thin burgers are pretty meh.  They just never have that juicy medium rare middle that I long for.  Lines are too long during peak hours and you wind up waiting just as long on off peak hours.  It's hot.  The chairs suck.  The fact that the bathrooms are outside for some reason grosses me out.  

It's not that I will never eat there.  I just won't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5

This was my first time coming here. A couple locals recommended my sister and I come to this place. We looked at the reviews and had to try it out. The location is right next to the ASU campus. It has an old western look on the outside. On the inside is a casual look with a condiment bar right in the middle. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger. The burgers were instantly put on a grill that broils the meat giving you that family BBQ type of look and taste. I was excited to eat my burger the minute I saw it cooking on the grill. Once the burger is cooked you can put whatever condiments you want on it. The burger was good it tasted like a typical burger cooked on a grill. I just felt like I needed to have another because he portions weren't to big. Overall I did enjoy trying this place out definitely recommend eating here if your in Tempe."}
{"text":"They have the best burger ever! I have yet to find another place that has burger like chuckbox's. I sure miss this place since I don't live there anymore. Only drawback is that it's cash only, do make sure to bring cash! I love my burger with pineapple, yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this burger joint a lot. Been coming here for almost 10 years. I moved out of town but every time I'd come visit, I always make sure to stop by the chuck box. I love this place. However my last visit really turned me off about this place. I took my boyfriend to this place since I've been raving about it. While I was getting condiments one of the guys that worked there made a sly transphobic comment towards me then tried to cover it up and yelling across the room at his coworker. I was very disappointed that it ruined my good experience from this place from the past. Will never come to this place again and will not be recommending this place anymore to people I know."}
{"text":"Whoooo child! I would've gained so much weight if I went to ASU. That Torpedo burger looked legit but my appetite was not up to the challenge. 

Burgers were juicy and cooked to order, topping bar had everything we needed to load our burgers.

Jalepeno poppers were perfect popper size and onion rings were nice and crispy."}
{"text":"I left here full, not stuffed, satisfied and a fan of this delicious little establishment. I just left and already I can't wait to go back. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries and poppers were a lovely addition to my meal."}
{"text":"The absolute best burger i've had. Hands down. The chicken sandwich is great too! Don't skip out on this place if you're in the mood for a burger.

Also, like people said--- they only take cash. Be careful!"}
{"text":"The Chuck Box is a staple for any Arizonan as its been at the Tempe location for over 30 years.  Sadly the Scottsdale location (Taken over by Oreganos in about 2003) was much closer to where I was raised. 

If you are a fan of IN&Out and 5 Guys, and want to change it up, I think this place is a great place to go.

The burgers are some of the best chuck you will find, grilled over mesquite wood which gives it a savry smoky flavor.  They cook the burgers right in front of you if you desire to wait in line, or they will just yell out what order is up while you grab a seat.  Toppings are self serve and fresh.  The burgers come in sizes of \"a great big one\" (3/4 lb), big one (1/2 lb), and a little one (1/3 lb).  Make sure to order the fries extra crispy, though onion rings and fried zucchini are local favorites.

I recommend anyone visiting Phoenix and claims to be a hamburger aficioando, to try this place.  Be mindful of the Cash Only concept."}
{"text":"5 star burger for sure. Made to order over flames in front of your face. Boom. If that's not enough, the chicken and the beef patties  are fresh, fat and delicious. 

Toppings are done buffet style and you sit on a wooden box. Lol serious. The chairs throughout are wooden boxes. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfectly portioned burgers and fries for under $10! I got the bacon cheeseburger and loaded it up with all the fixins at the condiments station. 

Really cool atmosphere with crates to sit on instead of your basic chairs. This place really knew how to dazzle me. 

Only pay with cash so bring those hundiessssss!!!"}
{"text":"Local Favorite! Grate burger cooked on a Mesquite Wood Fire Grill who could ask for more. 
The meat is good quality not the best of the best but good. The portion size is very good and you place your own toppings so how can you go wrong.  This place has been there forever serving the Big Juan and has been successful so they must be doing something right. That something right is their Wood Grill that perfectly cooks your burger to order."}
{"text":"I've been either living in Arizona (in the 80's) or for the last 25 years coming to Arizona and never miss a chance to stop at Chuckbox. It was said in the eighties that John Wayne would have killed for one of these great burgers and it's still true today. They tend to run a little too short on staff at night (and you'll get to hear Charles bitch) but the taste of that mesquite grilled burger makes up for it. One of the best burgers ever!"}
{"text":"I always thought The Chuck Box was a dive bar that was known for their burgers...man was I wrong!

Very simple decor. Very simple. To the point that you may think \"Do I really wanna eat here?\". You do!

The prices are more than affordable and you get a good amount of food for what you pay. The staff was nice, the food was really good, and my only real complaint is that the center \"island\" that has all the fixins was really low.

This is a great place for a quick, hearty bite."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places! Char grilled and delicious! I usually have the \"Tijuana Torpedo\". Football shaped patty with green chili's and your choice of cheese. Then you have a large choice of condiments at the condiments bar. 
For a side ordered jalapeno poppers and deep fried mushrooms. Poppers were great. Mushrooms needed some salt but, other than that, good."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in a looooong looooong time. Mainly because it was too close to ASU and working as a TA there was not the safest place to scape from my students.

The good side is the grilled patty!! that is a winner on it's own!! then you have completely freedom to do your burger the way you want to. Juan knows better!"}
{"text":"Chuck Box, I love you. Are you perfect? No. Are you completely sanitary? Probably not. Do you conveniently take credit cards? Perish the thought. But you serve one helluva good burger. Give me a tijiuana torpedo and some jalapeno poppers and I'll forget all your flaws."}
{"text":"The  burgers were very tasty. Fast and friendly service. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This little dive is such a sentimental piece of my life. My father has been coming to the chuck box since it opened 45 years ago, and he has been bringing our family ever since. We have spent countless years having dinner here before the ASU football games and I can't imagine ever going anywhere else when I'm in the neighborhood. The menu is simple and the most important tip is that they are CASH ONLY!! Take head people , and bring your cash. You get to stand and watch as they grill your burger and fry your sides right in front of you. The place is tiny , for big events they set up and extra grill their parking lot with tables and chairs to help accommodate their dedicated fans . I swear to you they are the Best burgers in Tempe ! Go try them , you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever!! Definitely try out the \"Great Big One\" or the \"Tijuana Torpedo\" (A little messy, but definitely worth it!)."}
{"text":"While cruising down University killing some time, my friend noticed The Chuck Box, and stated that we had to go there.  Other than the obvious mentioning of hamburgers, we had no idea what to expect, but based on the fact that it was a little wooden shack that was spouting smoke, we assumed it HAD to be good, and right up our alley.

Later that night after a Fall League baseball game, we decided that it was the perfect time to try The Chuck Box.  The parking is a little sparse, but there was space for me, so no complaints there.  The exterior is about as dive-y as I would have guessed, to no complaints there either.  Upon entering, the interior is total dive, wooden walls, tables, benches and stools.  No velvet ropes here, but a bigass chain to separate those in line with the rest of the customers.

I ordered a Big Juan, and savored the pleasant aroma of a slab of beef going onto the grill right before my eyes.  It was cooked perfectly to order, and I took my time at the condiment area to load it up with what I like.  But not too much to eliminate the flavor of the beef, which was cooked just right, still a little juicy, but nice and warm, with good natural flavor.

My only knock on it is the cash-only policy.  There is an ATM there, but typically I don't carry cash on me, but since I was being all touristy, I was prepared.  But that just meant I had to pay for my ill-prepared friend who was being too cheap to get decked with ATM surcharges.

Otherwise, The Chuck Box was a fantastic find, and well worth the experience, and was a fine burger overall."}
{"text":"This is still the gold standard for burger's in the Valley for me.  The Tijuana Torpedo is my go to, although I've had all their burgers.  They throw green chilis on their WOOD FIRE pit and grill them, before placing a fresh patty of beef which has pepper jack cheese pounded into it, and then throw hot sauce on it (which is not really hot, it's more of a chulula type thing).  It's freakin' huge, and it's so good because of the method of cooking with the wood.  

You pick your own fixins and then sit down in a cool saloon-ish vibed place and just enjoy your burger.  I live in Scottsdale and will trek down to Tempe just to get it sometimes.  Yeah, it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here every time I'm in Tempe.  It's a 5 minute walk from most places on the ASU campus.  Really good charcoal grilled burgers,  the fries and rings are okay but not spectacular.  But I like the no frills setup and self serve condiment bar.  Cash only.  Arrive hungry and leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Seems they switched their veggie burger to some sort of store bought crap. Which sucks, they had an awesome veggie burger. Oh well, its lucky I'm an omnivore! 

Still an awesome place to eat, but I miss that veggie burger!"}
{"text":"By no means the best burger I've ever had but still quite good. The guacamole bacon cheese burger was especially tasty. 
The atmosphere is awesome, no fuss."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a Port of Subs that he swore he'd seen in Tempe, and while we never found it, we ended up at The Chuckbox!  And I'm glad we did, because it was delicious!  It's sort of like a Fuddruckers, but I think the burgers were waaay better!  I got the guacamole bacon burger.  The guacamole wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty decent.  They cook the burgers on an open flame right in front of you so when you get them they're hot and juicy and delicious!  I also got onion rings, which were pretty darn good as well.  I will definitely go back there whenever I'm feigning a burger!"}
{"text":"Chuck Box is amazing. It is the best Burger Joint in town and an amazing place to get a burger. They grill the burger right in front of you, the staff is awesome, you decorate your own food, and my favorite to order is a great big one with onion rings and a large soda. Thank you chuck box"}
{"text":"Jess' fiancee here, D.

I moved to Tempe from Ohio 2 months ago, and as far as burgers have gone, I've been extremely disappointed. \"In-n-Out\" is supposed to be a legendary chain on the west coast, and I was let down extremely. Smashburger wasn't any better either. So, I talked it over with Jess, and she suggested The Chuck Box. 

Suffice to say, this blew every other place away. I ordered \"The Great Big One\" a little prematurely, as I saw the \"Tijuana Torpedo\" only after I ordered :/

Anyway, the burger itself was cooked to a medium perfection. Incredibly fresh, seasoned throughout...couldn't have been a better patty.
The bacon was probably the nicest surprise. Cooked, but not too crispy. Also, IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR BURGER. Ingenious. 
The condiment bar was a nice addition as well, but shredded lettuce/onions/etc. is a pain in the ass. 
The only complaint I have is with the bun, they just don't seem up to par with containing the burger. Pretty bland.
The beer was pretty reasonably priced too, it made watching LA winning the Stanley Cup just a little more bearable.

That being said, this is my second/third favorite burger place of all time; they do nearly everything right.

4.5/5 stars for The Chuck Box, I'll definitely be back a lot of times in the future."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with my girl, a friends dad, and a rescued bulldog named Nina. First visit btw and aside from the wait everything was amazing! Burger was cooked medium as requested and the condiment bar just topped it off. It is cash only but don't worry they have an ATM just as u walk in. The four of us including the service dog Nina, had great food and a great time. We will def b back. Thank you for being a great establishment"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite joint in Tempe it's as good as it was 20 years ago when I came to asu. I haven't been to In-N-Out in over a year now that I live close to chuck box. Please don't ever change. But I'm not boycotting inout I just need to get my fill of chick box. And those onion rings rock"}
{"text":"Holy Molly!! If its near a university it has to be good!! I was.

Dont expect fancy. It ain't.

The hamburgers patties and chicken breast are thrown on as you wait in line. One of the best chicken sandwiches and burgers EVER!! If they had fresh fries and onion rings, it would be the best fast food in the universe. Seriously!  

Someone convince them to use fresh fries and onion rings.........hint hint

The beer selection rocked. I love local brews. Tasty stuff Maynard!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for a regular burger . Even smash burger better than this place. I've tried cheese burger but it's taste like a regular burger, no tasty flavor or special sauce to attract you"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the Chuck Box is One of the few places that, if you're an ASU Student and you don't go to, you didn't do ASU right. The burgers are brilliant and/or life changing and cheap. It's simple. Not exactly 5 star atmosphere, but you're not going for a classy place with candles, ties or suits. Hell, they have potato sacks on the ceiling. The place isn't pretty at all. If anything it's reminiscent of a sty. Still, you're not going there because it's pretty, you're going there because they have some burgers that can make you squeal with joy and push the limits of your belt buckle. These burgers set precedent for all burgers everywhere. It's part of the college experience at ASU."}
{"text":"This place is cash only. I know that has been mentioned a few times in other reviews, but it's always a shocker for me. 

The Chuck Box is a-okay. These are definitely not fancy/gourmet burgers. Think of it more as a dive-y bar burger. Oh, and don't expect to escape the heat at the Chuck Box. When you first walk in the door, you are greeted by the grill and a plume of smoke. 

The Food: I ordered the veggie burger with fries (FRIES). Although this is a vegetarian patty, the burger is not vegetarian. The patty is cooked on the same grill as all the meat products and there is no separation of patties or utensils. If you are a strict vegetarian or a vegan, do not even think of coming here. 

That being said, the garden/veggie patty was fairly good and at least the Chuck Box has a veggie patty. (I'm looking at you, In-N-Out!) The fries were also good. Not the best I have ever had and far from the worst fries I have ever had.

My ASU friend got the great big one (1/2 lb.) and the guac bacon burger with cheddar. Both burgers were thin, thus cooked well done, like a normal fast food joint. He said the bacon was okay and the guac was a little spicy, otherwise to average, smoky burgers. 

The Condiments: In the center of the restaurant is a large station for adding your own toppings. My friend enjoyed the opportunity to put as much stuff on his burgers as he wanted. It was a mess of onions, pickles, tomatoes, mustard, and jalapenos. I added a bit of ketchup, lettuce, and tomatoes to my burger. The lettuce was just sad looking. So, so sad. Maybe bring your own lettuce?

The Drinks: No milkshakes here. Just soda and beer. The former is served in styrofoam cups next to the grill and the latter is served in mason jars. 

Overall, this is a cash-only, average burger establishment. No frills, just thin, smoky burgers."}
{"text":"I just fell in love with this place. ironically, it was rally quiet when I got there! Just go for double great big one"}
{"text":"Pretty good in terms of affordability, but don't expect anything that stands out from a standard burger at a pub ot bar. They do, however, create a cool rustic environment, with the wood furniture and dim lighting emitting a nice western feel. But, other than that, i dont think they provide much more than other burger chains like Five Guys or In and Out (I actually prefer those two). Especially if youre looking for something to eat in Tempe, I would suggest trying a different place to eat."}
{"text":"The best hamburger I've ever had. The one from Matt's Big Breakfast comes close. Bring cash. Get here early. The line can be long but I've never regretted the wait. I'm a huge fan of the onion rings."}
{"text":"I like it! I like it! I like it! It's cheap and good.

They salt the hell outta the fries and the burgers are grilled right in front of you. It's about 4 blocks south of the light rail, so it's easy to get to from the Light Rail. And you can get beer!

The interior is dark, sparse and a bit run down, but that's what they are shooting for so, so be it. Basically a damn good burger at a good price."}
{"text":"Im not gonna say its the best burger in town like others cuz in my opinion it's just mediocre flavorless meat. The condiments is what makes the burger really n i got the biggest burger 1/2 lb. N the meat was pretty big but the bun was like ummmm we need more bread.lol , i did like the fried zucchini it was delish, onion rings were good to++the setting inside is small but pretty cool. Service was fairly fast n polite a plus. I think the prices were a lil high for the burgers n the xtras ,bacon,avocado,chilli etc. If u never been I'd try once n see how u feel."}
{"text":"Never fails..best burger I've had and the fact that it's always packed tells you how good it is. Rafael is on the grill and nails it every time. Must try!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a flame broiled burger. Had the Double Great Big One. Was not disappointed. Small joint with local feel. Best of all worlds. Wish the fries portions were bigger and wish they had tots. Otherwise giddy up folks."}
{"text":"Gotta love back-to-basics places like The Chuckbox! Simple menu, affordable and cash only, and quite the bang for your buck in terms of deliciousness from such an unassuming spot.

I got \"the great big one\" and a side of fries and it was all awesome! Don't be too intimidated when they throw that frisbee-sized burger patty down on the grill (it shrinks up to just a bit larger than the bun). The thinness allows them to handle the large volume of customers and leaves you with a perfectly-cooked burger. I'm not sure what their blend is, but it's a delicious patty! The fries are pretty standard, but they were cooked perfectly (not too dry, not too soft, and not too salty).

The fixin' bar is nicely stocked and clean, despite what you'd expect upon entering a place with such divey vibes, as well. The only thing that was a bit intimidating as first-timers was the ordering process. If it's your first time, maybe check the menu online before you go. If the lines are long, don't be surprised if they ask you what you want well before you get close enough to the menu to make your decision. The staff is nice, but you certainly feel a bit rushed by their system! Luckily, I'm guessing they do a pretty good job with whatever they turn out, so you could likely order anything on-the-fly, and you won't be disappointed.

As a fan of places like this, I appreciate their pace, quality, and service, and would certainly visit again if I ever return to Tempe! Oh, and the cheap prices don't hurt, either!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in town. Once you walk in, you can see that it is very unique. They use charcoal to grill the burgers and have a condiment station. Not only are their burgers amazing but their side orders as well. This place accepts cash only! They do have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Um, so if you're a stickler for sanitary methods of food preparation including the island where you get condiments, you might not like this place.

I don't believe that there's anything quite wrong with this place with that regard, but the fact that there isn't air conditioning doesn't make me want to get a burger here in the middle of a Phoenix summer for so many reasons.

That aside, the burgers are delicious. I don't like their fries and would probably skip those. When I was here about 6 months ago they still didn't accept any form of payment besides cash. They have a skeezy ATM machine in the corner, but I'd really rather not pay the 2-4 dollar fee for a 6-7 dollar burger.

It is good for burgers and I wouldn't recommend for anything else. Definitely appeals to red-meat loving men."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is slammed on gamedays for a reason."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Only down side is they don't take any sort of plastic/card, but that doesn't seem to stop anyone. Always busy around lunch. Burgers are cooked as you order on the grill right in front of the queue line. Reasonable prices and super fresh ingredients with an entire bar dedicated to all the toppings you can handle. They do an awesome job. Easy and relaxed casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here with my Boyfriend - We love it!!
They grab your order while you wait in line and the burgers and the battered onion rings are soo delicious!! 
They serve beer too
The place has a condiment bar , clean bathrooms and you can watch them cook your food while you wait! 
I definitely wanna go back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere staff parking all above expectation! For everyone family and college creatures ! Best part local and cash only"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Chuck Box. My father introduced me to this place, and told me that he had been coming here since he was a kid. The burgers are amazing. They're juicy, and full of flavor. The lettuce is crisp and fresh, and the cheese just melts in your mouth. I love this place, but I live far away so I can't come here often"}
{"text":"These are real flame broiled burgers, you can see and feel the flame while you are waiting in line to pay.  Arguably the best burger in the Valley."}
{"text":"The best burger in town. I have been going to the Chuckbox for well over 10 years and it is still a treat. Cold beer, delicious burgers and fries can't be beat!! Make sure you bring cash though - or else use the ATM located inside and suffer convenience fees :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the Gold Standard of hamburgers!

At age 73, you can imagine I've been around the hamburger track once or twice.  

Lived in multiple cities in CA, OH. courtesy of years in the airline business visted cities world-wide, and NOBODY makes a better burger!  The burger itself is always done perfectly, and with the enormous condiment bar, it's enough to die for.

Again, absolutely the world's best!"}
{"text":"After a 20+ year hiatus I happened to be in the area for lunch. Same great burger as I remembered from back in the day. Now that I have kids at ASU hopefully we can make this a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"OK, this is my FAVORITE burger place in AZ (maybe anywhere)!

But, they get ridiculously crowded (not a whole lot of people per se, but the place is tiny and the grill setup is awkward for ordering and standing in line).

Each burger is made to order in the order it was ordered :-D

Delicious, but they almost lost me as a customer last time, because it was 5 min before closing and they said they were cooking anymore orders :-(

I once ate the largest burger on the menu too :-)

I am sorry, I worked in the restaurant industry for years, and if you are OPEN, you are OPEN.

Pissed me off so much, I vowed to not return, but....I did...just cant resist these mesquite grilled patties of deliciousness!

Cash only so bring it-they have an ATM but stupid high fee.

GO AT LEAST ONCE!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2008 and each time it's the same great taste. Best burgers in Tempe."}
{"text":"Overall the food was ok. I didn't like how they don't take credit cards, that was painful since I don't carry cash. I had a burger, onion rings and fried zucchini. The zucchini was my favorite between the three. In fact that is why I am giving this place 4 stars. That will be the reason I return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my big one double patty with bacon and cheese and green chile was worth the price because I didn't want to go home and make it the French fries were the best the fixing bar was nice too put as much as you want on your hamburger"}
{"text":"The best hamburgers ever!!! Forget going to chain hamburger places like Five Guys or even In N Out...if you want a juicy hamburger cooked on a real grill, this is the place! My dad came here when he went to ASU and passed this restaurant along to me! I always get the small hamburger, because even the regular hamburger is wayy too big! Plus an order of onion rings, zuchhini, or mushrooms completes the meal!"}
{"text":"This place is a legend! Nothing comes close! Been a family favorite for YEARS! The long line at lunch time is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has been here forever & its no secret why. I can remember the very first time when I was a kid & Madre was wrapping up her masters at ASU. Zia was in the same parking lot. My kids throw Chuckbox in the mix when hankerin for a burger (Ive never said \"hankerin\" before & I promise never to again)
Chuckbox is not for burger snobs so stay the hell away & shut up. If you want a generous sized burger cooked over blazing mesquite, this is the place. Slide over to the sneeze guard protected relish bar & finish it how you like....simple, quick, yummy & cheap. Just like me"}
{"text":"I've only ever heard great things and Chuck Box was one of the only places in Tempe that I had never been to. So I had to see what it was all about. 
All I can is, Meh. I like the old building, I like the patio, the burger was decent, like something you'd eat at a summer barbecue, but nothing that blew me away. I was surprised that it was a little pricy. 
The fries were under a heat lamp and reminded me of cafeteria fries, you know, the kind that come frozen in big bags from Costco. 
Smashburger and In-and-Out are both in close proximity and I'd rather go to one of those places than here."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Fresh beef, chargrilled over mesquite give it great flavor. They only take cash though. If they took debit like the rest of the world, I would have given it a five star."}
{"text":"Great burger, fun environment, fast and easy. Took a group there and it was a great experience. A must go to restaurant if you like something different than a typical sit down burger joint"}
{"text":"The chuckbox...wow. The burgers were phenomenal, the fries were good but not amazing, the condiment bar was scary but I did have the cajones to put mayo on my burger and I walked away with narry a hint of a problem. I won't make a trip to Tempe for it but if I'm around campus and wanting a burger, this is where I'm going.

btw - the cash only thing, annoying but not a deal breaker. I wish I was the owner of that ATM machine."}
{"text":"These are the best burgers ever cooked right before your eyes they have chicken sandwiches too sides like fries and onion rings, there is a condiment bar to add whatever and they have beer and wine too its cash only but there is an atm in the corner they have a small parking lot"}
{"text":"Best burger in Arizona. If you disagree you are wrong. Simple, good quality, great hard working people. Nothing extravagant but a well made burger. Place is not fancy or overly polished but it's a burger place... don't overthink it. Also it's a real life crusty crab."}
{"text":"I think The Chuck Box has been around since the time my dad went to ASU, which was many, many years ago.

When I was living in AZ I would come here occasionally & I've been here a couple times over the past few years when I've been in town for a visit.

The burgers (and BBQ chicken sandwiches) at The Chuck Box are DELICIOUS!  If you like burgers & can care less ambiance/atmosphere then come here.  If ambiance/atmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review & ignore the five stars.

Like I said the burgers & BBQ sandwiches are fantastic (and according to my mom and sister the hot dogs are as well...they're served cut in half on hamburger buns).  Everything is grilled to order so it all tastes fresh.  A couple things at The Chuck Box that I think get overlooked because of the burgers are the sides....particularly the fried mushrooms & zucchini.  I don't know what it, but the mushrooms in particular are to die for!  In addition there's a large condiment bar w/plenty of fixings w/anything you can think to put on a burger including ranch dressing, which is perfect for the mushrooms & zucchini.  

The place itself isn't much to look at, but who cares?  There's only one person taking orders as you walk in, and there's often times a line almost out the door.  They also just call orders out as they're ready, not necessarily in the order as they were placed, so things can gets a little helter-skelter, but in the end it's all good, and the Chuck Box is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced burgers. It's great that you can customize your burger & watch it be grilled. One of the better burgers I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and omg I don't know why I haven't been here before!! Definitely will be coming back. Food is fucking amazing. I got a guacamole bacon burger and it's now my favorite!! They grill everything fresh in front of you and you get to put your own condiments on your burger. Great prices too. I think my burger was like 7 bucks. I recommend this place for sure!!!! 

It's Cash only."}
{"text":"I fixed my friends' computer so he agreed to take me to lunch. Of course, I had been meaning to check out Chuckbox a while ago because all of my friends go every Friday for lunch. In fact, for some of them Chuckbox is so special that it can only be had on Fridays for lunch. As such, I was kind of excited to see what the hype was about.

Ordering your food is really simple, their menu is really basic and its easy to figure out what you want to eat. Even though I don't care much for the white or wheat dilemma, I still thought it was cool that they offered such a choice. But I like to be old fashioned, \"Big one\" + fries and a cup of water. You can smell Chuckbox from a mile away sometimes because they are grilling ridiculous amounts of meat. The aroma is extraordinary, and you would probably forget that you're in the scorching AZ sun. 

Once you actually get your burger you pay, cash only, and take your sandwich to the condiments bar. They have pretty much all the basics you'd want in your burger. They even have extra lettuce and ranch, which equates to a free salad. Are you winning yet?

Overall, the burgers were extremely flavorful, and it was plenty of food for the money. The only downside is that beef patties were frozen and that takes away from some of the flavor. Its not that I have anything personal against frozen beef, it just doesn't have the same juicyness as something that's not frozen. For this same reason, I think it loses a star. Other than that, its a perfect burger joint."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I ate at the Chuck Box! Despite being a prodigal patron, with as far as a decade span since our last meal here, the burgers are still good as ever, with reasonable prices for what you get.

I browsed through the menu and decided on the Tijuana Torpedo ($6). It was a monstrous meal, with 1/2 of ground beef, 2 whole grilled green chiles, and jack cheese. The burgers are grilled right in front of you, and sides include fries, onion rings, and fried zucchini.

The burger bar has a plethora of toppings to choose from after you get your burger. Such options include lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, onion, mustard, ketchup, and relish. 

The burger was quite tasty, with a pleasant grilled flavor from both beef and the green chile. The green chiles I had were pretty mild, so if you want to kick up the heat, add some jalapenos from the burger bar.

Be sure to remember that it's cash only here. This keeps prices down, but at the same time it can be inconvenient if you typically don't carry much cash in your wallet. They do have an ATM machine though if you've forgotten!"}
{"text":"Like I always say, meat always taste better when you have a heaping amount of veggies. The burgers are great and the open salad bar makes this place all the more delicious."}
{"text":"It's only taken 25 Years, but I finally made it to the Chuck box! I had \"the Big One\" 1/3 pound burger cooked on Mesquite, juicy and perfectly cooked. You put on your own condiments, I don't like the wilted Iceberg or that the condiments are all in open containers with some flies buzzing around. Seating is crates for chairs inside and logs outside. The inside is VERY small and smells of burgers and fries, aka greasy. That being said, again, tasty, tasty burger! The grilled chicken also looks really good. No Trans fats used to fry with, good news. A big one and a soda runs $8.50.... in the ASU campus area, craving a burger? Check out this Tempe landmark. 4 star burger, 3 stars because of the interior..."}
{"text":"To quote Jules from Pulp Fiction, \"Mmmmmm...this IS a tasty burger!\"

The Tijuana Torpedo is especially good!  Jalapeno jack and green chili on top of flame-broiled tasty beef goodness!   

Have had the fries (of course), mushrooms, and zucchini.  All which are pretty good.  

If you go on a Saturday during lunchtime, parking can be kinda of crappy.  Finding a table might be interesting.  And the line inside to place your order, get a tasty beverage, wait for your grub, and pay....a kluster-F!    BUT, the burger is worth it.  

The condiment bar is super sweet!  Always fresh and stocked.  At least when I've gone it has been.  

This place is CASH ONLY, so plan accordingly.  Unless you like paying ATM fees!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's tiny, casual & from the looks You'd think it was a dive. It's home of one of my very favorite hamburgers. You can't beat it!! It's a family tradition to eat here before any ASU event!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out based on the recommendations of multiple people.  Met a friend there around 5 PM.  I was happy to find on site parking available which is rare for that area of Tempe! (FYI:The parking lot has multiple signs stating that the lot is reserved for The Chuck Box and the tattoo parlor next door.  I wouldn't advise parking there and walking to a different business because they will tow your car.) I ordered The Big One with Cheese and a side of fries.  I was hoping to have a beer with that but the selection was very limited so I opted for water.  The food was so so.  I was expecting the burger to be amazing based off of what people had told me.  It was decent, for the price, but nothing to rave about.  Even with all of that, i would have gone back to try something else on the menu had it not been for the horrible customer service i received!! I have to say that the young lady who took our order was very patient and sweet. She didn't rush us while we were trying to make up our minds and she shared her suggestions with us.  The problem came when after i had ordered my fries, (had a hard time deciding between fries and onion rings) i heard my friend say she was ordering a combo.  I then said \"oh! That's an option? I'll take the combination too!\" thinking that meant it would be a combo of fries and onion rings.  Well when we got to the fry cook i saw that it was fried zucchini and mushrooms. I told the gentleman that i had ordered a combo of fries and onion rings. He replied, with an attitude, that this was not an option.  Being that I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms i was trying to think of a solution. I said fine I'll take the zucchini, mushroom combo.  The fry cook says that there are extra fries there and to take some if i want.  I then said that was fine as long as i didn't have to pay for an extra side.  He then rolls his eyes at me, hollers over to the cashier while pointing at me, telling him not to charge me for the fries.  Thinking I'd still be getting the zucchini/mushroom combo, i paid for my meal and proceeded to visit their condiment bar for burger toppings. The cashier told me that he would bring me the combo but never did.  The fries ended up being undercooked as well! I can understand that it was my misunderstanding that caused the confusion, but there was definitely a much better way to handle the situation than to be dismissive and rude.  Because of this, i will not be dining there again."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times but never tried it. The whole \"cash only\" thing sort of threw me as well. 

Well, I have definitely been missing out! Their menu is pretty basic (but in a good way). I went with the Big One with Cheddar cheese. The burger was great! I didn't get fries this time but definitely will on my next visit. Seriously, check this place out! Oh, and they have an ATM there, FYI..."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers in Tempe! I think I've been getting the Big Juan or Tijuana Torpedo for 20 years and never dissapointed.  Not places cook on a 100year old grill these days.  Sooo good. Who can beat the view of the ASU ladies walking by out front too! 
Are they still cash only?"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good burger with loads of smoky charcoal flavor. Grilled in front of you over actual charcoal, this burger place makes them just like your family did for cook outs on the fourth of July. They even have you put on your own condiments like you did back home.

Which all in all is great, but also pretty limiting. They do make burgers a bit better than your dad ever did, but not by a whole lot. It really is like eating food from a family barbeque--tasty and full of nostalgia, but not much more. It IS cheap, to be fair, but doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. The best burger joint in Tempe. The Tijuana Torpedo is my favorite."}
{"text":"In the heart of ASU campus.  

Come and enjoy a fresh made chargrilled burger.  

Nothing fancy but then again burgers aren't a fancy food.  

The ambience of this place reminds me of a run down cabin. 

The lines to order usually are long but it moves fast.  

All the fixins'  are in the middle of the place, odd."}
{"text":"One of the best things about moving to Tempe from Chandler was being closer to The Chuck Box. My older cousin and uncle took me there as a treat when I was a child. As a grown-up, I was there almost weekly.

Few things make me happier than scarfing down a perfect burger with a cold Coke, snacking on some fries, sitting on a wooden box and swatting at the occasional fly.

I miss you Chuck Box, and I want a framed portrait of Big Juan for my living room."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised-  I recently saw this place feature on Serious Eats (excellent food blog, foodies out there ) - and it gave this place an excellent review
NOW - granted - I am about to give you a three year old review, but I came to this place enamored - weird lines, strange seating, didn't give a crap, I was all about that log cabin with the smoke billowing out of it - given the way Arizona operates, this little shack must make one HELL of a burger. 
Well - not really - the burger was smokey sure, but over cooked. The wings were OK, but not what I was craving - nothing about this spot was memorable, except that for a guy who seems to visit AZ once a year, I was never tempted to come back..."}
{"text":"I have been going here for decades! The best burger in town. The line is well worth it. Cash only, top your burger to your liking. The owners are the best! My birthday was a tattoo, and Chuckbox! Now that's the best birthday."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for their burgers but have to give em 3 for their fries.. It's nice but not AMAZING in my opinion. I'm definitely coming  here again and would highly recommend it. The patties are half an inch thick and it's nice that you can specify how you want the patty cooked. 

Cash Only! So be prepared or use the arm inside. 

There's parking available but DONT wonder off the premises and keep your car in their lot it will get towed. 

Friendly service and while the line may seem long at first it moved really fast. The inside interior is cute and simple, a little rustic even. I like the outdoor seating area where you are sitting in giant piece of rounded wood - I forget the name heheh ..
Anyways come here and get a double patty, if you're not super hungry and don't have a giant appetite get a double \"little one\" otherwise get the BIG ONE.. And I got a double little one w cheddar cheesex2 but my next visit will be one cheddar slice and one Swiss - nice balance I think."}
{"text":"Came here after reading reviews. This was a delicious burger. The bacon was perfect on there. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I came here with higher expectations because I had heard that this place was awsome but I thought it was just ok and barely that. When we walked there was no AC and it was around 110 that day so you can imagine how hot it was in a place where they are grilling up food. It was super uncomfortable to sit there and eat when your hot and sweaty. They had dusty old fans blowing that look like they hadn't been cleaned in years. The place has a very old dingy look and feel to it even from the outside. As for the food also just ok, nothing impressive. 

I have to say I did not try the burgers, I had a chicken sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"This is an example of a no frills traditional type of burger instead of fancy cheeses and buns. The taste is on point and good. Only thing I would wish I could do is ask for mine medium don't know if they can do it but next time I will ask. Trying coming around 1 the line tends to slow down."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have to be the odd ball out I guess. I have eaten at Chuck Box about 5, maybe 6 times and I have tried  both the burgers and the chicken sandwich. I truly don't understand the hype. It's okay but nothing spectacular. However, the onion rings are fantastic! 
The staff is usually rude, I've only been once where I think someone was pleasant. The burgers aren't cooked to order. The condiments are all sitting out and for some reason it bothers me. Don't know why really, it just looks...off...like I can see people waiting in line and I get this irrational idea that people are just standing there...breathing on everything. I don't know! Also the reason for a two star verses three star review is that they don't take debit or credit cards but instead have a lovely little ATM that is expensive. It's 2013, almost 2014 actually, stop taking a stand or making whatever statement you're trying to make and just get a card machine."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger kind of girl, but I do like this place. I'm very picky about beef and quality and here it's pretty good. Love that they flame broil the meat right in front of you and you get to put any toppings you want, and as much of them as you like because there's a little toppings bar. Very casual place to eat, and has that cool, western rustic feel."}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of this place an quite frankly I never have been. The entire ordering system is completely screwed up. You walk up and order and then you are supposed to stand there and wait for them to cook your burger, while people try to pass in front and back of you to get their food that is done before yours.  This is also the same place where the refills are so you have to maneuver around the condiment table and through the line to get a drink refill. 

The condiment stand is a haven for germs. Last time I was in I saw a dude sneeze and then use his fingers to grab pickles. Geeerooos. I went pickle-less that visit. 

The seats sucks and the tables are dirty and you wind up smelling like a campfire from all the smoke. No thanks. 

And they only take cash!"}
{"text":"I have lived and grew up down the street from this place and never been to it.  Until one night my friend and I wanted something to eat.  Was craving a burger but not from fast food. I have to say this is hands down the best tastiest burger I've had in a long long time.  Juicy grilled right in front of you.  Omg. Just make sure you have cash they are cash only."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's sister goes to ASU and has an apartment in Tempe so when our first choice of lunch ended up not being in the location I remembered, (Dave's Dog House) she suggested coming to the Chuck Box to have their \"amazing burgers.\" We got there a little after lunch rush which was nice because it wasn't crowded at all. There was a line of people but the cook seemed to get every order spot on.

 For sides we asked for two french fry baskets and onion rings. I filled my drink and was waiting for my food when a younger guy who was behind us in line walked in front of me to grab his burger, and took our order of onion rings. At first I assumed he had asked for some as well and since his order was for one person, and ours for three, I figured it took less time for his to be done. But as I waited to see if any more onion rings were being fried up, no one started them. I mentioned this to the cashier and he told me that this happens often and it doesn't really matter because you pay for everything at the register when you get to the end so it's not like people walk away with your food free. Still he had to ask the cook to put in a new batch of rings and it took a minute or two. Obviously I should be taking stars away from that oh so respectful gentleman that needed onion rings in a hurry, but he is probably out playing beer pong or tubing down the salt river. 

The food is amazing to say the least. Fries could have been crunchier but hey you can't win em' all. The condiment buffet was surprisingly free of flies even though the doors swing open frequently. 

Will be back sometime soon, and hopefully keep a better eye on what I order!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I lived at the dorms. Don't come here much anymore, but I do try to make it down once or twice a year.

Chuck Box is some of the best burgers and chicken sandwiches in town. You see your whole meal made right in front of you, which is great, plus they have pitcher beer (nothing special, just standard American piss beer). The chefs are very animated and will be more than happy to help you make your choice (as long as there isn't a huge line). Once you have your burgers and fries, you go to the topping station and customize your meal. This is my favorite part. Can't beat their burgers with onions, pickles, ketchup, lettuce, the works.

It's pretty irritating that these guys don't accept credit cards--I always forget this before I come and I end up needing to scramble to the ATM. BRING CASH! There is a Bank of America ATM on 7th caddy corner from this place and I think they have some no-name bank ATM inside. Also, parking is tricky so just be sure you don't get towed wherever you decide to park."}
{"text":"Very unique. It feels like your making hamburgers outside your home. They don't have thousand island sauce though!! Noooooooooo"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall burger joint. No pretensions to be anything else. Great cooked to order burgers with a fixin's bar. Very casual. Cash only. Satisfies a burger craving perfectly."}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger spot, they are a throwback, in the best way possible. No frills, just fresh delicious burgers, chicken and even a tasty veggie burger too! Just bring cash, they do not take cards. Staff is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"It's just a burger. Sure, it's good, it's cooked to order, and you can top it how you want it. I wouldn't drive 20 miles to eat here. (FYI: cash only)

Pros: It's cheap, about $4 for a burger. The quality of the meet is good, and the cooking crew knows what it's doing. The onion rings are also excellent -- actual rings of onions, no bits and pieces.

Cons: 1) Dingy, dirty, dark. I don't mind the rough and simple setup, but it would be nice if they cleaned all the drips and spots off the condiment bar from time to time. Finding tomato slices in the mustard is not pleasant. Garbage overflowing the barrels is also a problem. 2) The french fries are sub-par. They're undercooked, barely crispy. Stick to the onion rings. 3) The lines. This place doesn't have enough room for all its customers, and it can be a zoo. Go off hours, if you can figure out when that is."}
{"text":"A must-try-burger-joint in an unassuming spot; delicious, affordable, and a unique atmosphere!

Be aware of 2 things:
- CASH ONLY
- Be ready to yell your order at the guy well before you get to the front of the line."}

If you have been searching your whole life for a box that serves chuck, the name doesn't lie, look no further.  In close proximity to Arizona State University, the Chuck Box fills that niche for a homesick student looking for some of daddy's buggers made on the grill.  No need to wait for the weekend, the onion rings are also great and the condiment bar is free range just like at home.  You can order you burger by the size or by non-free topping or you can get chicken.  There is also outdoor seating if you don't mind sitting on a stump."}
{"text":"I must say... for a place that specializes in burgers, this was the worst burger I've ever had. (And I do re-emphasize, this is based on places that specialize in burgers.) The taste was definitely nothing special. They had toppings at the toppings bar, which reminded me of Fuddruckers. But this was basically Fuddruckers but with poor quality burger patties and poor quality buns. The fries were nothing to write home about either. I didn't try the onion rings, but I'll admit they did look good. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Delish!  Take cash and don't worry about the calories - it's worth every bite!"}
{"text":"WARNING: Cash or GTFO

The Chuck Box feels like a place where a bunch of gruff guys just decided to start a simple, no-frills cookout cafe from their backyard. I want to complain about the long, disorganized lines in which you place orders 8 spots from the grill by yelling what you want...but it seems to work. No one's order gets messed up. 

The burgers are legit...nice quality, lean beef that you get to watch sizzle on the flame. Don't order yours well-done, or the staff will roll their eyes, and people like me will give you dirty looks for holding up the line. I got the Tijuana torpedo, which is just pepper jack and green chile. Even though the bun is a simple, wimpy sesame, it still holds up to be a nice meal. Fries aren't shabby, either. I'd like the burger to get seasoned just a tad bit, but then again there's a couple dozen condiments for you to choose from.

The menu is simple, affordable, and filling. You can grab a table and a beer and catch some sports. It's just an old-fashioned establishment that deserves to survive the gentrification of pretentious local-this and organic-that eateries."}
{"text":"This is the only place I eat burgers from. Because I don't eat burgers. But I need to go from time to time to Chuck Box! It's super tasty and so well done! Don't care about the wait and the smell because that's part of the experience. I would maybe pay more attention to cleaning but that's all."}
{"text":"Been eating here for decades.  Tijuana torpedo is perfection with onion rings.  It hasn't changed at all and that's a very good thing."}
{"text":"Delicious burger being cooked in front of you on a wood fire grill. Yes, please! I was curious about this place after seeing some pictures and was not disappointed.  A couple of notes:

- Cash Only 
- It's not fast food, they cook the burger when you order it.  
- Get french fries you won't regret it! 


A place to go for a simple great burger, it's one of the best burgers I have had"}
{"text":"So I am going to rate this place 4 stars. I may come back and change that, and my friend who took me would call me blasphemous. 

The service...you walk in stand in line order your burger and sides and watch them make it. All fine and dandy it was very cool actually.

The food. I had the regular burger, and it was good. Great even, but from the heavenly experience my friend mentioned I wanted just a tiny bit more from the meat. (Yes make your jokes now.)

The fries were good, the onion rings were fantastic and their ranch dressing? Im gross but I could drink that stuff.

I want to go back and order the Tijuana torpedo...I think that may be what Im missing here to make this five stars. When I get back there I will update you guys!

It also doesn't hurt that its located right NEXT to Pop Culture Paradise (Sorry the Geek is showing)!"}
{"text":"An ASU institution! Great burger cooked over a wood fire, customizable like no other place I know. Also chicken and hot dogs. They have a great system, a very efficient process. Everything is fresh, cooked to order. 

There is a very well stocked condiment bar for making your burger just like you want it. Peppers, ranch dressing, relish, onions, pickles, all kept cold over ice. 

Warning: bring cash, your plastic is no good here. Parking can be tough during busy times. 

Never a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with how well the food tasted here.  This is one of the best tasting burger places in The Valley!

It is not a glamorous establishment and it takes cash only.  However, the burgers and chicken are grilled on a huge charcoal grill right in front of you as you wait in line.  They have all sizes of burgers.  You can choose between a white or wheat bun and you can choose what cheese you want.  Also, there is a bar with condiments and toppings that you can choose from.

The fries were about average.  I don't like onions, but my friend said he liked their onion rings.

I would highly recommend this burger joint to anyone!  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the chuck box since first going to college at ASU in 1988.  It was great then and its great now.  I love the burgers grilled on an open flame right in front of you.  
I love the elaborate toothpick communications system they have to indicate what meat goes on what bun with what cheese.
It seems like they used to have some yellow/ banana peppers on their condiment bar but the last time I was there they only had jalapenos.   I enjoy the Big One with jalapeno jack on a wheat bun.  I get  side of fried mushrooms.  
Everything about the place is just about right.  No five stars because they don't take cards - cash only."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place but never had a chance. Today was my day. Didn't know what to expect but it's very rustic, western looking with wooden carton boxes as the seats. 

There was a long line to order and they take your order while your in line. It's almost somewhat like a cafeteria style. Wait til your burgers are ready then you can pick up everything else like drinks, onion rings, and fries. Also, cash only. There is a sign that says they take cash only so they can get the line moving faster. They do have a ATM machine by the ordering line. LOL

We ordered the Great Big One which is a 1/2 pound with american cheese and wheat bun. My wife got the chicken breast on wheat bun. They charcoal grill your burgers and chicken right in front of you. It's amazing that one guy is grilling and can remember everyone's order. Really good memory. 

Once you get your burger then you go to the condiment bar to put your own condiments that you want. 

The burger was really good. Love the charcoal grill taste. Very juicy and tasty. Also, tried by wife's chicken breast and it was very moist and tasty.  We both enjoyed our burger and chicken.  They give you a small order of fries but they were good. 

I really enjoyed this place and the food. Close by ASU and I know I will be back. Love the concept. Not too fancy. Just good burgers. Enjoy. I sure did."}
{"text":"It seems like they're enjoying what they're doing. Their food is the best. Burger King or McDonald aren't comparable to their burgers. Even though the waiting for the food is long, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for over 15 years and by keeping it simple has kept their food delicious! Best filling fire grilled non-chain burger you'll get. Always worth it."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than this. Great burgers, friendly service, reasonable prices, and the perfect location. Come here to feel proud of good ol' American food."}
{"text":"It was an excellent joint!!! Burgers were great juicy and huge burgers. Definitely visiting when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Bun falls apart
Meat was dry
But the mushrooms were good (fried)

I like Ted's better for a cheap cookout-esque burger"}
{"text":"Great location.  Decent burgers and ok wings."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome staff!! I love how they cook right in front of you and on an charcoal grill. Seems to be very busy when we go and that is a good sign and also they have a sign about how long they've been open and it's almost full which is awesome! 45 years strong"}
{"text":"The place is simple.  Don't expect anything fancy.  However, expect to get a great burger.  A bunch of friends and I came here after a game.  I initially thought it would be a mistake to go in.  I was pleasantly surprise.  Try them out. You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Hey, with over 600 reviews, I don't think my review is going to make a big change. But, I'm putting in my two cents.

I went to the zoo with my son then did a little hiking and then went to the Chuck box. It was actually recommended by a friend, and I saw good reviews on yelp, so I thought I just want to get a good burger and would try it out. 

It's a fun place, to begin with. Simple - - paper plates, you actually sit on boxes, no fancy-schmancy service. But, friendly. It is cash only. If you don't figure this out by the various cash only signs posted as you order the food, you're kind of dense . There is an ATM in the facility.

Stand in line order your food and wait in the same line. It gets a little crowded in the line, but You get to watch your food getting grilled over the hot coals. I had a bacon cheeseburger, delicious. My son had a hotdog and it was served on a hamburger bun, they sliced it into multiple sections. There's a help yourself condiment bar with all the Fixin's, including ranch dressing which is a must for my son while he dips the onion rings.

You go to the Chuck box for just a good old delicious charbroiled burger, and a hole in the wall atmosphere. Clean restaurant. And the place was packed. I'm giving this four stars because it's what I expected. Just a good burger. I've had better burgers at some places, so I'm reserving a five for the best of the best. But I'd go to Chuck box again anytime, and plan on taking other people there. Hope this helps"}
{"text":"Honestly, I will not let Norm ruin my, one third of a century long, love of Chuck Box burgers and would come back and eat here again. But if nothing else, maybe somebody should talk to Norm about not treating customers badly. SO here is what we went through.

I have been coming to this place for the last 33 years. THE FOOD NEVER DISAPPOINTS. Great tasting burgers. So the two star rating is NOT for the food. (That deserves five stars)

I am a creature of habit so I always order the same items. The Little One (it used to be the Big One but I'm older now) on white with jalapeno jack cheese, french fries and mushrooms.

My friends and family always want to go to the Chuck Box when they visit from out of town. This evening was just such an occasion. I have family visiting so we went there. No disappointment in the food......except when Norm tried to pull a fast one on us. Other than about six people already dotted around the dining room there was no one there. So we placed our order, and moved up to get ourselves our drinks and wait. 

We watched the cook, start the beef patties on the grill and throw the mushrooms and onion rings into the fryer. After watching him for a few minute, I thought maybe he had not heard my order of the fries, so I mentioned that I wanted fries as well. 

Suddenly Norm appeared from somewhere and said that he had them. He proceeded to get some older already cooked fries out from the tray next to the fryer, threw them, with an attitude, into the fryer, and pulled them out after 15 seconds. He then put them into a couple of paper fries envelopes and placed them under the heat lamp. 

We were a little concerned with this. Then a minute before our food was ready Norm threw in two batches of frozen fries into the fryer. I looked at that and thought, \"OK so we don't have to have the re-fried fries\". So a few minutes later when our burgers, mushrooms and onion rings were ready we collected them and moved to pay. 

Norm rang us up and asked why we did not take the fries. So we said that we would like to have the freshly fried fries and we could wait for those. So he got upset and said that he had made those fresh just for us and the new batch was being made fresh for the new people that had walked in after us and if he gave us those new ones then he would have to make more for them. 

So I stood there trying to understand if Norm is a liar, or if he actually believes that taking already fried cold fries and throwing them into hot oil for a few seconds makes them fresh or maybe he does not actually know that we were standing in front of the fryer watching him and the cook the whole time. I finally said that I did not want the fries he was offering us, so he promptly picked them up and threw them into the garbage. (If they were so fresh why did he not just give them to people who were right behind us in line?)

Anyway for the first time in the three decades that I have been eating here I was disappointed by the service here."}
{"text":"Best burger in the state of Arizona.  My only complaint is that I now live farther away than I used to.  Flame-broiled, good-sized burgers, and you put your own condiments on them.  We also like the onion rings.  My father in-law always requests to go here when he's in town from Texas."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger, there is no better choice then the Chuck!

I first discovered this gem while attending ASU, and can't get enough. Don't be alarmed by the very old decor, there is no missing when it comes to burgers in this shack with the charbroiled awesomeness and the overflowing toppings bar.

Try the Tijuana Torpedo!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of bone-in hot wings? Neither was I, until I came here. These are the only bone-in wings I'll eat in the Valley. The wings are so hot that if you get the hot sauce on the table, the copper finish fucking oxidizes. This won't stop me from indulging in the never-ending goodness of a big platter of them. 

Oh yeah they also have the most AMAZING gigantic burgers ever. I don't care how much they cost, it's worth it way more than any chain burger joint in town. No wilted lettuce or soggy pickles here. Fresh condiment bar. Unique Western setting as well. 

PS I'm not affiliated with them or paid by them in any way, by the contrary I usually end up with the empty wallet here but it's totally worth it even on a college budget."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bacon, avocado burger + cheese is everything!!! Their onion rings are also really good. 

This time I also treated myself to an old-fashioned root beer and was not disappointed!!! This place is overall a great place for lunch. 

They are cash-only & have an ATM."}
{"text":"Ok the last time I was in this shack President Carter and Billy Beer hit the USA. Nothing has changed, just aged a bit.

And as Samuel L Jackson would say \"Mmmmmm...this IS a tasty burger.\""}
{"text":"This is one of those places that just gets it right. It's a simple recipe for success too. Make great burgers and have a great location. I can only image how much money they must make as the place is always packed. 

Parking is crazy pretty much all the time, seating is tight too. But when you are in Tempe and want a really good charbroiled burger then this is your spot to go."}
{"text":"Not the best tasting burger in the world, but not bad. Fun atmosphere, ASU tradition. Best root beer in Tempe for sure."}
{"text":"Fresh, charbroiled juicy burgers! Had the Tijuana Torpedo and will be back! Burger bar with fresh fixins too and great tap beer. Small place and busy but these guys do it up right and tasty. Go now!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, once again! Love the guacamole bacon burger. My daughter's had the \"The Little One\" with bacon and they loved it.

Can't wait to return! Even for just the smell of that meat on the grill...."}
{"text":"I swear, I love this place...My rental car always makes a beeline when when land at PHX to the Chuck Box........there is nothing better watching your big fat juicy burger getting flame burned on a charcoaled grill.....My mouth simply drools on the floor watching the cook flame your burger.....Amazing burger, awesome environment.....Nuff said,,,,It is simple an awesome....grab you a Chuck Box burger ! ! ! ! !"}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh and hearty, but the lettuce provided kept falling out of my burger. But overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic! The fries could've used a little less salt."}
{"text":"Had a burger here today with a buddy for his birthday.  Great fries, great onion rings, and great burgers!

The condiment bar is a huge plus.  All of the traditional condiments, and lots to choose from including jalepenos, which makes me happy.

The tables have real copper tops, which is pretty rad.  You sit on old wooden crates, and if you sit outdoors, you sit on old wooden logs.

I love that this place has never updated the decor.  No need to.  

If you think it is too hot inside, you should check you surroundings.  They are cooking with fire, and you wait for your food right in front of the grill.  You know the old saying, if you can't stand the heat...

When I was there today, other people were ordering chicken sandwiches.  Honestly, anything is going to taste great cooked over that mesquite fire.  Can't say I've ever had one.  Gotta get the burger here."}
{"text":"If you want a good burger that's NOT frozen or from a fast food restaurant, but also is a GREAT price for college students ..... Look no further! The Chuckbox is awesome!

The burgers are big and juicy and homemade and their fried mushrooms/zucchini are REALLY good, if you don't mind fried food....which I don't :D

Also, all their employees (well most) have been there forever! Making it pretty cool that the joint has so much history. For example, the place opened 37 1/2 years ago and the current supervisor has worked there for 37 years! The main burger chef has been flippin' for 20 years! And other employees have been going into The Chuckbox now for 9 years and counting. 

Oh, and they cook it right in front of your eyes while you wait in line to pay :D how fun!"}
{"text":"Very Classic burger joint. They make it right in front of you like your uncle does at a cookout (only with a lot more professionalism). The bun flip at the end was good too.

The burger was cooked well, good taste and a surprisingly soft but. Top it as you choose and you've got a good burger. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat before seeing a part at ASU, and these folks are up the street. When we walked in the door our mouths started to water. Sign says cash only to keep prices down & their prices are great and the food OMG! I had bacon cheese burger, mom had teriyaki chicken where shared onion rings. The have a condiment bar so you can fix your toppings to perfection.  The portions were huge! Worth the money & then some! Found our new BEST burger place for sure!  The only thing they can improve... The seats, no padding, bring a pillow if you can't sit on a wooden box. LOL!"}
{"text":"went here for the first time the other night and i gotta say i was very impressed my burger was delicious! and the bar of condiments and other goodies, looooved it. i will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I arrived at ASU for my freshman year in 1997 and I just went to Chuck box for the first time... TODAY!!!! Nuts.  My boyfriend loves it and I told him I was craving the kind of burger you get at a friend's backyard bbq.  Chuck Box was exactly that.  It's not fancy.  It's good.  I kinda think it's expensive, but then again... as another yelper put it- it's a Memorial day bbq burger and I'd rather pay the $6 (kinda pricey) for the a la carter burger then go out buy charcoal, buns, meat, etc, etc. 

Negatives: cash only.  so annoying.  it is a flat patty so just a heads up.  overall it's good, but nothing to go out of your way for.  

the best thing: you don't feel sick after.  I always feel that other burgers like in and out of five brother are so greasy you love eating it, but feel bad for doing so after.  that never happens when you eat a backyard bbq burger like this one!!! think about it.  i hope that makes sense! :)  enjoy."}
{"text":"Took a drive to Tempe to The Chuck Box.  Delicious hamburger.  They offer 3 sizes the great big one at 1/2 lb.; the big one at 1/3 lb; and the little one 1/5lb.  Great tasting french fries..  Great burgers, home made root beer. Easy parking with a private lot."}
{"text":"I gave The Chuck Box five stars because in my opinion it's one of the best places there is for a good burger at a good price.  It's nothing fancy at all...just good.

One of the things I like most is that they have a condiment bar so that you can choose exactly what and how much you want on your burger.  I love pickles and no matter how hard I try, I just never get what I want when someone else does it.  Everything is always fresh too.  

If you don't want a burger, you can get a chicken breast or hot dog, but it seems almost sacriligous.  

This is a good spot for lunch on weekdays if you work in the area.  It's not as crowded as you might expect given it's location in the middle of a university campus.  And it's amazing how quickly they seem to get food out ( you have to wait in line for your burger ).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Cash only! There is an ATM inside. There are signs clearly stating this but people are always surprised, so I figured I'd mention it here. 

Burgers are very good. You have the choice between a big and a little patty, and one or two patties. I think the double little one with extra cheese is the perfect meat/cheese/bread ratio. 

There are various other items you can have added to the burger upon ordering. They have bacon that is shaped into a ring the size of the patty to ensure complete bacon coverage. Other options include pineapple and green chilies. 

Other toppings (pickles, onions, lettuce, etc) and condiments are available at a self serve buffet table after you receive your burger and pay. 

Fries and onion rings are just average."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a bunch. I like the idea the history and the atmosphere of a shack but this place is somewhat overrated.

To me the guacamole is what does this place in. I cant get over the use of  frozen artificial guacamole. The burgers are decent but could use a little improvement.

Over all I do like this place and may be harsh on the rating I wish I could give it at least three stars but I feel their overpriced for what they serve."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I got the bacon cheeseburger with mayo and with American cheese w/ fries. They cook your food right in front of you over a charcoal grill so it's fresh and hot when you get it. Their root beer off the tap is awesome and served in a cold chilled glass mug. 

Kinda sucks that they only take cash for payment but they do have an ATM inside for you to use. I think it's a $2 fee to use it though.

If you're in the area, check this place out. If I ever come back, you better believe I'm stopping by this place. 4 stars because they don't accept CC."}
{"text":"Ummmm... Awesome?? Yes indeed!! The double burger is priced right for the deliciousness that engulfed my mouth after the first bite. Open flames and cooked right in front of you makes this joint 5steps above its neighboring 5guys burger. 100% pure beef from this joint and the taste certifies it! If someone gives the place a non 5star rating, it's likely because they're a blind def mute with no taste buds.  I stopped here while passing through the city and Boom!!! New favorite joint in Tempe found!! Can you give me a what what??? Baller status for sure at this cash only burger joint."}
{"text":"GREAT ! Burgers  fresh fresh fresh   and I like the way to put your own topping on.  great flavor and 3 sizes to chose from and double it if you want.   Had the jalapeno poppers they were great as well.  we will be back, many times!"}
{"text":"Has quickly become my favorite place for burgers. I am addicted to the chicken burger along with the veggie burger! Simply the best I have had here in arizona! Yes it's cash only, yes the cashiers might not always be engaging BUT their food is simply amazing. Oh and THEY'RE BUSY. Located in the heart of ASU"}
{"text":"I have only been to The Chuck Box once before this, and that was just around my first month of living in Tempe. That was almost 5 years ago and I certainly forgot how good this place was!

I can't recall what I ordered here the first time I came but this time I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with Swiss cheese and some fries. With a medium drink added to that I was just a few cents north of $9. Not a bad deal when you get the satisfaction of seeing the actual ground beef patty being grilled in front of you. Everything was delicious again!! 

In a world that seems to be into the shi shi burger bars like Delux and Zinburger, it's great to still have an old fashioned burger joint like this around.

Oh yeah, don't forget to bring cash or you'll pay $2.75 getting cash out of their ATM. Just FYI."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty chargrilled goodness.  Dynamite burger.  The only problem?  It was so big it fell apart when I picked it up.  Get the burger with grilled chilis...the Tijuana!"}
{"text":"Birthday lunch! Great big one with bacon and cheddar. Love it.

Long lunch line, moves quick, worth the wait!

This is one of the great burger shops, the decor, the smells, the cash only, all add to its personality and charm.  Dont miss this place"}
{"text":"Used to be the best of the best, but not anymore. The counters, kitchen, salad bar and tables are dirty most of the time. 
The white guy with the beard who handles the cashier sometimes isn't friendly comapred to the others. 
My all time favorite order that I recommend if you are visiting them: Jalapeno Poppers, Big one with avocado. 
Oh, Cash only! (WTH!!! We are in 2014)"}
{"text":"Positively awesome cheeseburgers. Maybe one of the better ones I've had. Getting a green chile on it is a good idea, folks. Do it. The fries lack any personality, but they're good. I don't know if they make them fresh, but I really wouldn't be surprised if they were frozen. But everything else is incredible. As far as service goes, I'm taking a star away for that. Confused as to why this place is cafeteria style. Even if there are only a few other people in line, you'll be standing in line for 20 minutes, watching burgers cook. It's cool for about 2, then I just get hungry. That, and the guy running the cash register was a jerk. Girlfriend had her expired id while trying to get a beer(she's 24). She apologized because she'd simply forgot to throw it out. She pulled out her passport which she carries for work, and the guy still barely agreed to give her a beer. He lectured about expired ids while he literally took 2 minutes to pour the slowest poured  beers I've ever laid witness to. Let it go, guy. We got the picture. I even offered to just forget the beers if he was really THAT uncomfortable or afraid of getting in trouble over serving someone with A PASSPORT as id. He said no it's ok and then kept lecturing as he took a full minute to make change for us. Seriously had to walk away in the middle of his sentence because I felt like I was a kid again, getting lectured by my dad about learning to behave for the baby sitter. Loved the food and will obviously be back, but that dude shoulda taken a chill pill, brah."}
{"text":"Great burgers cooked right in front of you, good onion rings, rustic decor, place has been here forever"}
{"text":"This place makes the best burger in Phoenix and the price is very reasonable. I'm also very found of their hot and spicy chicken sandwich. My only complaint is that some of their new staff members just aren't as sharp as the old schoolers. I've been a loyal chuckbox customer since 2002 and I really miss some of the old faces. That said, you still can't beat the burgers...or the price."}
{"text":"First time here!! It's awesome! Fresh and fast!! There can only be Juan!  And the ranch is so good! l"}
{"text":"If you are not a vegetarian, this is the place for you! (Although they can do vegetarian it is still cooked where meat has been cooked.)  I personally didn't eat anything here except for the fries and come condiments, however it is a fantastic place to get a delicious burger exactly how you want it. We took friends here and they were blown away. It looks intimidating because it is a small old building in the heart of downtown Tempe, however it is a landmark and the service and prices are excellent. Parking is $2 across the street at the pay lot which is not bad considering what parking costs elsewhere. Be prepared for a long line out the door because everyone knows this is the go-to place for a hearty delicious burger and fries. The line says it all - they know what they are doing and people are willing to wait. Everything is cooked on an open wood fire grill and worth the time it takes to get your meal. Seating indoor or outside in the sun. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Old building dark and dingy inside. Wooden box chairs not comfortable. The burger was just average. If you grew up going through a drive up window you may be impressed by the fix it bar. Not anything special just average toppings."}
{"text":"Went in and had a bacon cheeseburger, hot dog and onion rings. Tried the fries too. Everything was pretty good. I wasn't able to finish it all because the burger is a pretty good size and it's nice watching everything cooked in front of you. It's not the best burger I've ever had, but it's good. It's the type of place that would be good to hit during lunch with some friends. The guys working the front were nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Chuckbox is a classic, a great, juicy burger with tons of flavor from their mesquite grill, run-of-the-mill-frozen fries, and a fixins bar that's real nice. They offer up a few extras, like a great chicken sandwich, but the star here is the beef and the charbroil it takes on.

Cash only is obnoxious, but the staff is consistent and the burgers are damn flavorful and good sized."}
{"text":"You can take Lobby's, Steak n Shake, Smashburger and all the other mid-west/east coast joints abd close them down.

THE CHUCK BOX IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE BEST.

The food, the staff and the location rock, almost the only place left that feels like home and a college hangout.

The burgers are great :) Fries rock, drinks are cold and everything is served by a staff that still gives a dang about making people good food.

For anyone that knocks this place ? Go eat cardboard as that is all you deserve..."}
{"text":"Great fresh burger that I'm not supposed to be eating (paleo), but they are as close to that backyard grilled burger as it gets with just about everything you'd like to put on it. Nothing else I saw on the menu makes this place stand out. The downside or upside (depending on your budget philosophy) is that they are an all cash business. We had two burgers, two fries and a drink which came to $23."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a burger! Always made to perfection. If you like guacamole and green chilis, I recommend the Great Big One Bacon Guacamole Burger with green chilis!"}
{"text":"These burgers are by far the best I've had in a while ! Bomb dot com ! The cook is cooking your burgers right in front of you with a great attitude helping you choose the burger that will hit the spot ! Cashier sucked ! Wouldn't even look at me to confirm my order too busy looking at the baseball game going on -.- would of got 4 stars but the cashier knocked the fourth one off smh"}
{"text":"So much simplicity that its to the point of being quirky & inconvenient & not worth the trouble.  

Its a shack with a wonderful odor of charbroiled burgers emanating from it.  The line is a few people deep but the line is kept moving as the burger crafters have you shout your order to them.  So yeah, just because youre not at the front of the line, you still need to be ready to order your big one, great one, great big one or whatever and fries, rings, zuchinni.  

Then you stand in front of the cook and watch your food get made like youre a 6 year old at a car wash.  Ok, i'd much rather order, pay & have a seat while my food is made, but apparently i need to watch it get made.  ok.

After youre food is made, you finish off the process at the condiment bar.  I like the flexibility & freedom to top it with whatever you choose.  But, i'd much prefer it if they were confident in their craft to construct a proper burger for you, instead of it being like grilling at a backyard high school party.  

I ordered a 1/3rd lb burger with cheese.  i should have gotten a bigger patty or a double since it was dominated by bun   :/

Oh well, i'll give it another shot.  The price wasnt bad, while it wasnt great, it wasnt bad."}
{"text":"On the culinary horizon beyond frills, shtick and gimmicks lies Chuckbox. The sign out front perpetually reads \"over 278 sold.\" The menu is simple. Cash only. The condiments are DIY. You get punched if you use the word seasonal, local, or organic. The great big one is both great and big. 

Undeniably, it's a wild world out there, with many a burger to tempt you. One day, you'll be ready to settle down... no games, no pizzazz, just pure, unadulterated sustenance. Chuckbox will be there to welcome you with open (cafeteria line-style, endearingly apathetic) arms."}
{"text":"The Chuckbox is severely overrated. On the strength of its reputation, it was one of the first places I tried when I moved to Tempe. Over the years I've stopped by now and then to see if it had gotten any better.   Nope, still the same boring burgers.

Char-broiling a burger over an open flame just doesn't do it for me. It always results in a dry, bland burger.  Mesquite or no, it doesn't really make much difference when you're quickly broiling the burger. And it doesn't help much to pile on a bunch of junk from the condiment/topping bar--it just makes the thing a big mess.  I'd much rather have a burger cooked on a flat griddle-surface like they do it at Delux and Welcome Diner. And when the kitchen applies the toppings for you, it results in a better melding of flavors with the rest of the burger."}
{"text":"Dirty little hole in the wall. all the guys are really nice and probably the best burger I've had in years"}
{"text":"Went here on recommendation from a good friend. Kids were out of school for winter break, so I brought the family with me. 

The sign on the west door says the line takes about 10 minutes from that point. More like 35-40.

Burger was pretty good. I had \"the big one.\" I like a food flame broiler burger. No seasoning at all though. Would have been better if the American cheese was tossed on a couple minutes before so it could get nice and melty. 

Toppings bar was fresh and well stocked

Fries were good. Dipped in BBQ sauce and the house made ranch dressing. 

No huge complaint. Wasn't best burger I've ever had but it was good. I don't know that I'd drive back again just to eat here, nor would I want to stay in a 40 minute line to eat here though."}
{"text":"Burgers are bomb and fresh just as they should be. This is a no frills, cash only, sit, eat, please gtfo and leave asap so more people can sit down joint. Because it's so simple, there's not much to go into detail about. 

Fries could be bigger because they remind me of the fries that came in my happy meal when I was 5, but that's just me and my fatty-ness roaring out loud. I heard that they used to take M&G, if that is true, then Chuckbox, Y U NO ACCEPT MY TAX FREE MEAL CARD?!!

Parking can be a pain in the butt sometimes, so watch where you park. There's about 8798723 red and white signs telling you that if you make the wrong choice, the odds will not ever be in your favor and Tempe towing will gladly make your night a living hell."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a mesquite flame grilled burger (or chicken) and you value the taste and quality of the meat as well as the overall grill flavor of the burger....

Then the Chuck Box is the only place to go in Phoenix.  There is a reason its packed at lunch.  There is a reason its been around for years while other places come and go.  There is a reason the locals swear by it.  There is a reason the atmosphere is minimal and the main draw is the burger.  The Chuck Box burgers are that good.

Why are they that good?  Its a mesquite open flame grill that has not had time to cool down in 20 years.  Trust me the burgers are moist and oh so full of that grill flavor.

As far as Mullac's review: Garbage, his other reviews are of bistros, not a burger expert.  As far as the condiment bar, its minimal because the burgers are 1lb and trust me when I say they only need minimal condiments to add flavor to the burger.  He prefers \"flat griddle-surface\" for a burger, that disqualified the review right there.

Oh and Lauren: Its busy during lunch because its that good.  If the burger at the Chuck Box was OK where did you have better?

Sorry I love food, and the Chuck Box got me all through college and is still a favorite.  Yes I created a Yelp account just to write this review.  Look at all the people who know what they're talking about, all the ones rating Chuck Box a 5."}
{"text":"Another staple of Tempe, Big Juan has been cooking up these char grilled burgers for some time now, it's a staple of Tempe.  Nothing fancy here, just good old American style greasy burgers.  Grab a Big Juan, Zucchini sit down play at the old school pac-man and enjoy your surroundings by ASU campus."}
{"text":"Been coming to this burger joint for over 20 years - back when it was in Scottsdale. Each summer we travel to the PHX area to stay for a couple weeks... Every year we come here at least once. In all those years I have never had a bad experience. Burgers are always spot on, delicious, and fresh. Great character, too! Love the Chuck Box!"}
{"text":"This place is Deelish. One of the best burgers in the Phoenix Valley! Everything is flame broiled over real wood charcoal exhibition style right before your eyes. Portions are good sized and the burger meat is fresh with plenty of charbroiled smoky flavor. Many fresh toppings available too. I had a \"Big One\" with Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and huge Anaheim Green Chiles that were also flame char grilled before they went on the burger. Buns are also toasted and hot. Very good fries and onion rings too! Extensive self serve buffet veggies and sauces to custom finish your burger too. They also have Chicken Sandwiches, Hot Dogs, and other choices too. Can't miss here!"}
{"text":"Perfect college burger place that has the appearance of having been around for a million years.  Real charcoal grill in-house and the burgers a cooked while you wait after you give you order head of the line.  As I now understand (and others may have said), the choice seems to be what you want...burger, chicken sandwich, hotdog, veggie burger, etc.  What kind of cheese?  Bacon?  Green Chiles? Guac?  Fries or onion rings?  Stop past the grill, get your drink, wait for them to hand your plated, freshly prepared order (pre-cold veggies).  Walk past the drinks, grab your fries or, and pay.

Lots of fresh prepared veggies and condiments on a salad bar type of island for you to add as much as you like.

Very basic interior and very basic single spot necessary (a his and a hers) on the out porch.  You know the place from college if you were lucky enough to go some place that did the thing just right.  This is just right, and has the BIG extra of wood grilled meat.

This place is as well done as the best of the breed.  Excellent!  I don't give many fives, but for what it is, it is just right."}
{"text":"Best burger in my town and probably your's as well.  I have people who come in town and the first place they want me to take them to is The Chuckbox in Tempe, AZ (close to ASU campus).  Great burgers, fries, cold beer simple.  ASU Staple for 30-40 years."}
{"text":"For hamburgers that are fresh, tasty, and cooked to order this has to be the BEST place in town!

Very packed during the lunch hour, so plan accordingly. With that being said, you open the door, stand in line and order.

As you approach the grill, you see your order cooking as you wait for it. Then you slide on down to the beverage station and get a drink. (I do believe they sell beer here)

After you pay and try to find a table you can than add your CONDIMENTS!

The Condiment Bar is always FRESH! You name it they have it!

If you don't do burgers that's OK too, they also have Hot Dogs and VEGGIE burgers!

Small menu - Big appetite!

Try to go after lunch around 1:30 and avoid on the weekends, especially since this is in college town Tempe.

Enjoy and let me know what you think when you try them out ;)"}
{"text":"Chuck Box has been around when I was a student '77 - '80.  THE BEST Burgers ever! After practice we would eat and drink (COLD beer) on the deck and watch the sights walk by, the best.  The Box has not changed.  Still the best burgers.  The great big one with everything on it!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.  I can grill a way better burger myself.  The fries were aveage at best.  I first came here during a busy lunch weekday.  I like to think that I'm marginally intelligent.  My friend and I both have master's degrees, but we were not smart enough to figure out the ordering system here.  Apparently they ask for your order while you're in line about 20 feet from the counter.  Strange.  I've eaten in a LOT of restaurants in my lifetime and never experienced that.  So we walked about to order, then had to find our way back to the line.  Very weird.  Took forever, then finally got our burgers, and after bumping into numerous people and stumbling around looking for place to sit, we found a junky old wobbly picnic talbe outside that was falling apart.  I've had better bugers at backyard BBQs.  And I've had better fries at McDonald's.  Disappointing, to say the least."}
{"text":"Bar none my favorite burger in 42 years of eating them.  The meat is awesome and grilled perfectly every time.  You can dress it up with whatever you want with how much ever you want.  I put a ton of stuff on it and throw it down.  
I don't care if the restaurant is dumpy.  I don't care if the single file line is out the door.  I don't care if they only take cash.  I get a perfect burger and decent fries and it is all worth it."}
{"text":"As a person looking for a good delicious burger...I would say this is average...maybe its the history that goes behind this place, but the burgers are not as they say. even signage on the walls proves that at one time they were good. back about 1/2 a decade ago.

The burgers, over the flame made them look delicious, and the idea that there is probably a few decades of grease going into each burger makes it that much more yummy at thought. But once I got the burger, MEH!!! i said. every bite disappointed, maybe adding a beer or being a drunk ASU student after a football game when having this burger would make it that much more better. 

The search continues...."}
{"text":"Chuck Box has been my favorite burger spot since moving to Tempe! As a college student, a huge plus for me is the affordability of this place. You can easily get enough food for 2 meals without spending more than $10!! Don't even get me started on the flavor: the charbroiled burgers have saved my life on multiple occasions and the buffalo wings are literally to die for (would also like to give an honorable mention to the chicken tenders + fries). The condiment bar is huge for me as well because I am usually too embarrassed to order all the weird extra stuff I like on my food. All in all The Chuck Box is an awesome spot if you are looking to eat like a King without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"The chuck box was recommended to me while in Arizona. I love a good burger. Im glad I went. I ordered a great big one  ( 1/2 pounder ) with cheddar cheese. I was hungry but I think I should have ordered the big  one which is 1/3 pounder. I am stuffed. Seasoned just right .  My friend ordered the fried zucchini, which was delicious. The line moves fast and you can dine in or take out . Cash only . Staff was friendly. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"THE place in the ASU area to get a badass char-grilled burger.  Brak recommends you go for the Big Juan with cheese, and a side of o-rings.  The o-rings are outstanding, beer battered and fresh.  Yes, the place is old, dumpy, clearly a MAJOR fire hazard, brutal parking at busy times, etc... but once you bite into that burger, you won't give a flying farkle.  Pure burger bliss."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! It reminds me a lot of Bun Huggers in Flagstaff (grill/cook the food in front of you, condiments bar, nearly identical menu), but they have much better french fries (which is a big deal to me - I love me some fries with my burger). We went here before seeing a show at ASU Gammage, and I'm a fan. I only wish it wasn't so far away from where I live (Peoria), but it's now one of my East Valley food spots for whenever I'm in the area. The prices aren't bad, and you get a lot of food. The restaurant isn't exactly nice inside, and the employees aren't what you'd call friendly, but I didn't mind much because the food was so good. The one annoying thing is that they are cash-only; however, they do have an ATM inside, where you can get cash for a fee (ours was $2)."}
{"text":"Fresh juicy burgers grilled to perfection right in front of you, golden delicious fries and a clean, fresh, well stocked condiment bar. Not much more I could ask for. The hot dog I got was awesome too. It was kind of odd that they butterfly the hot dog so it fits on a burger roll. Works for me though."}
{"text":"This place is over exaggerated, but they aren't bad. I think it is above the average burger joint and deserves some credit. The guacamole bacon burger is probably the best thing on the menu. The condiment bar is pretty fun and decent. They could use a little more variety though. The place is a little to small for my liking. During the summer it gets wayyyy too hot and humid."}
{"text":"The best burger place. Ever. Firewood grilled burgers! If you haven't gone yet, I highly recommend that you make it happen since it is an awesome burger."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty burger! I had the Tijuana torpedo which is a half pound piece of beef with hatch chilies and jack cheese. It was served on a regular bun instead of the torpedo roll on the menu. This burger was really juicy and cooked perfectly. The slight flavor of mesquite smoke was really nice too. Didn't really taste the chilies that much though. 

It took a while for it to come out though. I saw 2 people order the great big one after me (separate times) and they still got their food before me. Had fun seeing the huge bursts of flame as the burgers grilled over the open fire. I don't recommend the fries though, pretty small portion size and not especially good either. Parking in their lot is really hard too.

I'd come back for another burger though. That's saying a lot since I'm notoriously cheap and a $6 burger is \"expensive\" to me. I'm now going to start a quest to find the best burger in the area after finally trying this legendary place."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had.  Basic, no frills joint - but excellent.  We got there around 11:15 and were glad we did.  When we left closer to noon, there was a line of at least 8 people waiting to order.

Parking is a bit of a pain.  They have a tiny lot but then you are on your own to navigate street parking and in that area can be a challenge."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  The Chuck Box is the kind of place you can just plop down, relax, and have a good meal after a long day at Arizona State. 

I was first dragged to the questionable looking joint by my two fellow Digital Artist classmates at the time.  I can't remember the exact name of the burger I got but it had plenty of guacamole.  That alone makes this place a winner!

The portions are huge, the food is yummy, and there's always something special about watching your burger being cooked right in front of you.  Definitely give this place a try if you're around the area.  I wouldn't make any special trips out here though.  Also to note:  cash only."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Plain and simple. They cook the burgers in front of you when you order and then you go to a little bar area that has all the toppings so you can make it exactly how you want. A little pricey (for a fast food burger), but definitely worth it every now and then. They season the burgers really well and the meat is super high quality."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Tempe by far. Right off campus of ASU so it is in a prime location. They are usually really quick and Efficient. The only complaint is that they don't take card which can be inconvenient. Overall, definitely a place to check out if you're visiting Arizona State."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a backyard family barbecue. The juicy burgers and fried zucchini are great. If you're a bacon fan, you'll fall for the grilled mound of bacon on each of their bacon burgers. The Tijuana Torpedo is also a winner.

Their cash only policy is a slight inconvenience, but my gripe would have to be the inefficient ordering process. It does allow you to watch your burger cook, however."}
{"text":"My wife made us go here--right smack across the street from ASU.  Sooo...cash only place-fine, we knew this.  Best flame grilled juicy burgers ever!!  My wife can't have beef, so she had chicken breast--lovied it!  My burger was the best ever...and the toppings buffet was ice cold and the burger toppings all well chilled.  Just awesome!  Left very very satisfied and happy she made us go.  Will DEF be back!! :)"}
{"text":"Best burgers and dogs in town, cooked over a giant flaming grill before your eyes. Nothing fancy at all and that's the point. This is one of my kids' favorite restaurants of all time. Beer and wine available. Grab a stool and get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Simple yet perfect.  great flavor, fast line.  loved it"}
{"text":"FRIES!!!  If you ask for fries, you'll hear the guy yell 'FRIES!!!\" quite loud as the line moves on through.  Great personality to this place, from the atmosphere to the employees.  

When I visited here in the early 1990's there was the same guy everyday who did the fry yelling, and it's sad to not see him there any more.

Burgers and such are grilled right in front of you.

Cold beer served in cute mason jars.

Hot fries and other fried sides.

Condiment bar can start to look a little sketchy over time and there's limited seating during prime hours."}
{"text":"A million years ago, when I was a desert-dweller, the Chuckbox was my absolute favorite stop for a smoky tender chicken sandwich. The place is a dive, and was literally falling apart, just like their soft juicy meat. They grill the meat as you wait in a cafeteria style line with carniverous anticipation. Probably a vegetarian's worst nightmare, this spot is a MUST for any BBQ lover who is trapped in a desert college town."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!!!!! 
Cooked on a real wood fire grill and a topping bar with much to choose from. Love this place - take every out of town guest to eat here !"}
{"text":"My number one food choice is a hamburger. Outstanding burger with no frills. I like going to a place for the food and keeping the price in line. If I want ambiance I will go to a traditional restaurant. This has been around for years so it has stood the test of time. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at The Chuck Box for years and despite all the influx of high end burger joints, this is still my favorite burger in town. In fact, I am giving a five star rating here purely on the hamburger, which is absolutely delicious. 

Another positive is the condiment bar for the burgers. It is well stocked, so you can add what you want. The fries are good, and I like that they don't offer a huge portion at an inflated price like some burger joints in town.

As another reviewer alluded to, this restaurant definitely has character. It can get very crowded and parking can get sparse, so try to go during off hours or when ASU is not in session. it is also cash only, though they do have an ATM there."}
{"text":"This place is so good. However I didn't like the idea of putting your own toppings. But the quality of the meat is really good. I would come her again."}
{"text":"Love it! Great burgers and fries, they also serve coke products, a big plus! Great atmosphere and all the toppings u could want. No negatives I could find. Yummy."}
{"text":"First time here food was great loved how fresh food was better then a backyard bbq lol we've been looking for new burger places and came across this place would for sure come back!!! And can't wait to tell other burger lovers!!!"}
{"text":"Wow well...i successfully obliterated the Lenten fast, but boy did it feel nice! I'll be making a trip to the church soon, either for a funeral from cardiac arrest or for a confession after enjoying this food a sinful amount. This place has humble aesthetics and is kinda grungy as any good burger place should be. Take your choice of burgers, cheese, and cooked toppings, then you can decorate your burger with any number of condiments and produce. You can grab a local craft beer and enjoy your deliciously greasy creation on either of the two porches. Cash only!"}
{"text":"What you see is what you get at The Chuck Box. Straight forward, delicious and consistent!"}
{"text":"I had fond memories of the Chuckbox from my student years, although I hadn't been here for quite a few years. Oh, what I have been missing!
     The burgers did not disappoint. They were as wonderful as I remembered. Burgers are chargrilled to perfection, meaning exactly as you request them. Then you proceed to the condiment bar and dress the burger until it is just as you want it. 
     I added a side of zucchini and am so glad that I did!  They were delicious and I topped then off with the \"homemade\" ranch dressing provided at the condiment bar. 
     This would have been a five star review if they had accepted credit cards. Cash only here. That's a bit of an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Dirty place with employees that don't care if they got your order right. Meat quality was nasty. Never again. Yuck."}
{"text":"Circular bacon!  Yes, that is my favorite things about this place. You don't miss a bite without it. They have many options for burgers and a variety of cheeses and other toppings that you put on yourself.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. The onion rings are worth the wait too.  This is not going to be the biggest burger you have ever had,  but it is tasty and honestly I could not finish mine so I was very happy with the value. This is a busy place- you wait while your burger is cooked, so guess what... it is fresh! Seating is casual with a western decor and you can sit outside as well.  Parking is the biggest challenge, but if you are hungry you will find a spot. And as everyone else has said-CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"You have to be crazy to stand over a mesquite fire in the Arizona heat flipping burgers.  

But that craziness pays off in a remarkably charred patty, that has been licked with smoke and fire, after it has been cooked on a well seasoned grate.

It is one of those thin patties that one might expect to be brown all the way through.  But not here.  Not even after the patty has shrunk to over half of it's original size.  

For what it's worth, this place reminds me of a dirtier desert version of Clown Alley in San Francisco.

Fries are crisp.  We got the chicken strips for the little one, and they were well seasoned, and came out literally still sizzling with oil.  I would certainly consider eating some of their other fried foods.

My only nit is that I do wish they had rings of raw onion, instead of the large chunks of onion pieces.  I LOVE raw onion on my burgers, and these were just an unfortunate shape.  Either smaller or larger would have done the trick.  

On the plus side, I have to admit, I love a place that is so committed to cheap beer that the best things on tap are Budweiser and Michelob.  It was cold.  It was cheap.  It went great with my burger.  And naturally they sell it by the pitcher."}
{"text":"There will most likely be tons of people and it may be tricky to find a parking space but it's well worth it. These burgers are as simple or complex as you want them to be. They're cooked on a grill right in front of you and you can then add any toppings you'd like from the self-serve condiment bar. The staff is friendly and quick. Love this place and the burgers are just like a homemade burger off your own grill. It's no wonder it's always busy and it's been around for so long."}
{"text":"The is one of the greatest burger places I have ever been too. I love that they cook the food right in front of you and you get it fresh on your plate. They have a great condiment bar, the prices are fair and the staff is very friendly. Will definetly be coming here more."}
{"text":"As I was eating lunch today I was trying to figure out the last time I ate at the Chuckbox.  As best as I could figure out it was somewhere between 1978 and 1980. 

So anyway today I had the big burger  and split some fries and onion rings.  

The burger meat itself was good.  Everything else was kind of meh.  Fries and onion rings really weren't anything special and were a bit cold.  The burger bun was a on the stale side.  As mentioned the burger meat was the best part of the meal.

Overall I found Chuckbox to just be ok."}
{"text":"Unique spot. You stand in line and they cook your burger on a grill to order. You then order your sides (fried zucchini, mushrooms, onion rings, fries, etc.) and pick them up on your way to pay the cashier. Be sure to bring cash - it's cash only! Once you check out, you put all your toppings on your burger in a buffet with all the fixings. You can pick your own table to dine at and sit inside or outside. 

Food was pretty good although the burgers didn't have a ton of flavor to them. Service was also good and I appreciated their attention to detail. For instance, the bacon on the burgers is in a circle so that each bite gets bacon. They're also constantly refilling the toppings on the buffet. Homemade root beer was great, but no refills. They offer all the burger toppings you could think of, trash cans throughout, misters if you're sitting outside and need to stay cool, and even a free parking lot - which is pretty unheard of in downtown Tempe. 

I'd return because the old western decor and concept are pretty cool. It'd be a fun place to bring a large group as long as you warn people to bring cash. And I can see kids loving this spot too."}
{"text":"This place puts out the best hamburgers in Arizona, period. The way they are cooked over the mesquite wood is reminiscent of having an excellent hamburger while you're camping up in the mountains. The pricing is very reasonable and everything tastes just amazing. Even their ranch dressing is awesome, to some that might be a small detail but to me it's huge. Anytime I have to go to Tempe I make it a point to visit The Chuck Box."}
{"text":"This is a Tempe institution.  If you've never been here, shame on you!

Surprisingly, DH had never been to The Chuckbox in college, despite its proximity to ASU campus.  When I found this out, I dragged him, DD and DM for some good eats.

The menu is simple and so is the decor.

You must bring cash with you to pay, but they do have a handy dandy cash machine inside in case you forget.

The onion rings are good, the burgers are delicious and the drinks are cold.  
I'd also like to mention that the order of chicken strips is HUGE (5-6 full sized strips).  If you have small kids, two or three could split one order.  

This is counter service, so like in the famous Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld... just place your order and move down.  You don't want to annoy anyone.  ;)

We've been back a couple/few times just to grab a quick, consistent bite.

Stop in and enjoy The Chuckbox.  I know I do."}
{"text":"This is a landmark in Tempe and a mecca for ASU Students. 

The original place for building your own burger. Order the different size burgers and then add on your own fixings of lettuce,  tomatoes, onions, pickles, etc.

The burgers do not sit under a heat lamp and are placed on the grill after you tell them which size or how many patties. So you have a fresh burger and toasted bun which is placed on a paper plate. Great grilled taste and add customize to your liking.

We also ordered fries, onion rings and deep fried mushrooms which were all prepared well.

They also have hot dogs and other items but you have to come here for the burgers. 
When in Tempe or asu this is a must and then 20 years when you come back it will be almost the same with a little extra in price but not enough to have to break the piggy bank."}
{"text":"It's a dive but I swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had.  We used to come here a couple times of week when I was in college.  The BBQ sauce is to die for.  And it is so cheap."}
{"text":"Great thing about mom and pop shops, they offer some of the best food. Chuck Box did not disappoint. Made a visit when I was in Arizona. It's like a Subway, you walk in, you pick the meat then the toppings then pay. 
Meat was super moist and super delicious. Only downside to this place aside from the \"CASH ONLY\" is the crowd. Since it's located really close to ASU, expect no seats."}
