{"text":"If I ever willingly come back to Cleveland, it will be for the Brussel Sprouts at The Greenhouse Tavern. Service was fantastic (Thanks Kevin!), and the aesthetic? Lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tasted--duck confit wings, Brussel Sprouts (pan fried in a maple reduction--amazing), and venison bolognese (a little spicy but alotta tasty). For dessert, the pot de creme is a must. If I could give 6 stars, I definitely would!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a creative, perfectly executed, laid back meal with quality ingredients, this is the spot. It's my #1 dinner recommendation in Cleveland. 

The atmosphere is great. There are classic VHS tapes lining the walls for movie night, bikes hang, the bar is big and beautiful, and the ambiance is convivial. I like to sit at the bar for a quick bite and drinks with friends, but often find myself being joined by more than expected and movie to a table. Both are great. 

The menu changes, so go with what looks best. But, the crispy chicken wings confit are the best chicken wings in town and not your normal wing. The fois gras clams are perfect and the cooking liquid is great for soaking up with fries and/or bread. Also, get the crispy hominy. If you're with friends, these are great choices for the table. The roasted pig head is really great, but I'm not sure it will appeal to everyone. Also...

Animal style fries.

I typically drink whiskey when I come, but there is a good craft beer selection and I actually like the wine list as well."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken wing confit tasted good and fell off the bone but was very dry. The gnocchi wasn't really gnocchi but instead a shell pasta they do make in house and tasted good. But not gnocchi. And NO. I will not let you write down my CC# and run it later because your POS system is down."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pricey meal this is the place for you. Perhaps it is justified with the flavors that explode in your mouth-hole every bite. However, still pricey. So, if you're looking for uncommon menu items served to you by the phreshest hipsters this is your place. I've now been a few times and haven't left un-satisfied."}
{"text":"Ein weiteres gutes Restaurant auf der 4. Straße. Gutes, zum Teil vegetarisches essen, gute Weine, entspannte aber dennoch gehobene Atmosphäre. Zum Mittag oder zum Abend. Sehr schön!"}
{"text":"1st visit anticipation + highly recommended from friend + great reviews = disappointed?
Four of us went there for dinner on a Saturday night, the place was properly crowded and everything was looking great...but then the service was slow, enough so that it was a topic of discussion at the table.  Food ranged from great (I had a pork tenderloin entree that was dynamite) to weak (the Devils on Horseback were closer to cool than hot and left me with the impression they were made the day before and had been held in a warmer and the same went for the crispy chicken wings confit).  Dessert was great but it took so long to reach the conclusion that it ended up being anticlimatic."}
{"text":"@ Isabella C. - Totally nailed it.

Have been wanting to come here for a while and finally had an excuse to meet a friend from out of town. We were seated outside and ordered drinks...that arrived about 25 minutes later after asking about them (two bottled beers). I attempted to order the PLT...which the waitress said they were out of (out of bacon, lettuce and tomato?). 

Anyways, I ordered the pork sandwich instead and it was as Average is it gets - alot of bread, less than stellar amount of meat, no recognizable flavor. Service was slow and less than attentive.

Might give this a shot for dinner but other than that, this JUST OK."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Extra points for a creative menu."}
{"text":"Really interesting place.  We stopped after the browns /ravens game.  Lamb burger and pork chop did not dissapoint.   We are Interested in trying some more unique stuff.  Maybe next home game."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing special. This is a good place to go for a nice bear though, they have a huge selection. Great place to have fun in a group but I would go elsewhere if food is your primary concern."}
{"text":"Last time we were here was 1 1/2 years ago and it was fantastic! We just had dinner (6 people) for our friend's birthday...and everyone was absolutely disappointed. The waitress completely forgot about my dinner...after 10 minutes we decided to say something and she brought out some cold, soggy fries to make up for it. When I finally got \"Nana's Meatloaf\" the 2 slices were _maybe_ 1/4\" thick...not anything like _my_ Nana's meatloaf. But it wasn't just me! Every dish consisted of a meager amount of food on a gigantic plate...I'd expect this from other pricey establishments, but not from Greenhouse. The burger (ordered medium) was still cold and bloody. Altogether, we left hungry, $115 poorer and disappointed. We're not in any hurry to come back. The recent hype outweighs the experience."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on business with a co worker last week on our way to Detroit.  We needed a place t stop for a late lunch and cane across this trendy 4th street area with several restaurants and businesses along a cobblestone street.

Since it was late afternoon, they only had a limited menu but with the 4+ stars from Yelp and other sites we decided to give it a try.  It was not crowded; the wait staff was very attentive with a wonderful knowledge about food as well as the city.
 
We started off with a good brown ale, they recommended fries animal style, which is French fries fried in duck fat, in gravy and cheese curds and chunks of bacon with 2 fried eggs on top.( Not even close to the In-N-Out Burger animal fries)  Their fries are awesome!  We also ordered the Ohio Beef Burger which and the Grilled Lamb Ohio Burger, that comes with a side of chips, both burgers were juicy and had great flavor.  

The atmosphere is cool, (trendy) with bicycles hanging from the ceiling, with a 2 floor seating and a roof top deck, which was closed but due to open in a couple of days. (probably will open for opening day)
As for drinks they have some beers on tap, don't expect Bud or the like, also they don't have a blender or have soda guns, so forget the margaritas or rum and coke.  But bar is stacked with an eclectic selection of organically produced alcohols from boutique distilleries. 

Overall a good food experience"}
{"text":"The duck wings are phenomenal! Everything you can expect from a chef driven menu and resturant."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in town, hands down.  The fries are also amazing.  Those are the only two items I order on the menu anymore.  DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, you'll be hard pressed to find a better gastropub anywhere -- hence the 5 stars.  Greenhouse Tavern has an identity and it delivers on the promise.  I went here to try the Gravy Frites that were featured on Food Network -- those were as good as advertised, but they were upstaged by the lamb burger, which was the best burger I've had anywhere (steakhouses included).  Perfectly cooked to medium rare, juicy, with a simple topping of shallots and yogurt, served on a super soft roll that soaks everything up without getting soggy.  Don't add a thing to it -- just eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Had a bunch of weird Shiet on the menu. Tries way too hard to be hip. Extremely overpriced. But.... The wings were good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this Greenhouse Tavern is amazing. I can see it being even better in the spring / early summer. 

Wait staff is friendly and very accommodating. They enjoy the food on their own menu and you can tell. They are willing to help with honest recommendations and do it all with the smile and attitude that they have known you for years. 

Great selection of beers on tap. Local favorites, Midwest favorites, and more. 

The menu I'm told is ever changing but it has it's constant staples. I enjoyed the roasted pig head and a colleague enjoyed the lamb burger. Food was top notch and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I was born in Cleveland, so I have a soft spot for anything good there. Greenhouse Tavern is as good as it gets--anywhere. Whenever I am in town, I stop in, sometimes eating at the bar or outside or in the window. The crispy chicken wings are packed with flavor and fall off the bone. The pork chop saltimbocca is crisp and tender and juicy. The gravy frites are terrific, too, but are best shared. And do try the buttered popcorn pot de creme.....it really does taste just like buttered popcorn. Service has always been engaged and helpful when I have dined there. Do walk down the steps to the basement kitchen to watch the magic. And, yes, you might end up staring at a pig's head."}
{"text":"After seeing this establishment featured on Andrew Zimmerman's \"Bizarre Foods America\", myself along with a few other family members decided to give it a try.  We made reservations for a Thursday night around 7:00pm.  Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us with a smile and promptly escorted us to our table.  We were taken upstairs to a loft/dining area with about 8 tables.  

Almost everything on the menu here is unique.  Our waitress was nice enough to take the time and explain the menu to us.  She made sure to answer any questions we had and afterwards took our drink orders. I started out with a Manhattan, which took me all of two minutes to drink.  The mixed drink sizes were on the smaller side, so I switched over to beer and had a few delicious IPAs.  

Onto the food.  My uncle and I ordered the two dishes Greenhouse tavern is know for.  He ordered the bores head and I ordered the Fred Flinstone rib.  Both of these dishes took a little over an hour to cook, so we had time to enjoy some chicken wings while we waited.  The wings were cooked in duck fat, rather than conventional oil.  These were by far the best wings I ever had.  The flavor was just plain outstanding.  Very savory, with a flavor you might associate with lime, but is actually ginger.

Then, our main dishes were served.  It seemed like everyone sitting around us stopped what they were doing and watched the spectacle that was our dinner.  The plates that were placed in front of my uncle and I were not plates, but rather platters with enough food on each to feed a small family.  I almost felt intimidated trying to figure out where in the world to begin.  It truly looked like a meal Fred Flinstone would eat if he was a real person.

The rib flavor was similar to a good roast beef.  However, it was a chore separating the fat (lots of it) from the edible pieces.  After a while, I just got tired of the taste and gave up on it.  I'm not saying it wasn't good because it was.  I just think the dish is more about the \"overall experience\".

I wish there was a half star option because I would have given 3.5 stars instead of 3.  Excellent service, small mixed drink portions, excellent wings, decent entrees, pretty much sum up my opinions about Greenhouse.  Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! 

Finding a nice restaurant in downtown Cleveland is difficult, but after seeing GHT boast vegetarian and vegan options, I was excited to try it out.  

i will first start by saying that this place is NOT vegetarian friendly.  While they have had two main courses that  I could order, I chose the Winter Braised Vegetable Potee. It came  with 2 cubes of tofu, 2 cubes of polenta, and 6 cubes of vegetable and was grossly under seasoned.  It came in a plain broth that was not meant to be consumed and just made everything soggy. I could have prepared something at home that would have tasted 100% better and would have cost 10% as much.

Futhermore, I was completely disgusted by those around me ordering entire pigs heads.  One came at a table next to me and I completely lost my appetite- which may have been ok because the dish I ordered would not have filled me up.  

I cannot say one good thing about this place and I wish I could warn everybody to never go there."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for the first time and we had initially wanted to go to Lola.  But, luckily Lola was completely booked and we made reservations for Greenhouse Tavern instead!

Overall, a great restaurant with high quality unique food.  Would have given 5 stars, but it was just a little too salty.

Recently I've been on a gastropub kick, so this was exactly what I wanted.  Everything was very very flavorful!  It kind of reminded me of Chego in West LA, but, instead of intense, strong, asian flavors, Greenhouse Tavern's dishes had super salty citrusy flavors.

We opted to order one of the \"thirds\" and a 4 course chef's tasting menu (at $44 it is such a good deal!)  Best decision!  We got to try so many more dishes and they were all full portions, unlike some of the other tasting menus I've tried.

Crunchy Hominy - a little too salty, but hominy is always great and the pork cracklins are a really nice complement.  

Crispy Chicken Confit - delicious!  Not too greasy and cooked so well!  Again a little too salty after you eat a few of these, so I wouldn't necessarily suggest ordering both this and the crunchy hominy at the same time.

Fish of the day - really well cooked halibut & again, super salty sides to go with it.

Pork Chop - Definitely recommend it!  Comes with two types of pork chops and delicious sides.  Also cooked so well.

Stoner's Sandwich - OUR FAVORITE!!!  Ice cream over this waffle/bread/cake with chocolate crunch in between.  YUM YUM YUM!  Even though the BF doesn't really like sweets, he really wanted another one!

Victoria Brew Draft - really good!!  very light and crisp.  Exclusively brewed for Greenhouse Tavern!

House Red Merlot - also suprisingly good for being the house red.  Spicier than I expected for a merlot, but I LOVEEEEEE shiraz and spicier wines, so it was a pleasant surprise for me.

The atmosphere is very fun, trendy and SUPER DARK.  Honestly, a little too dark for my taste.  I mean does it really have to be that dark for it to be cool?  It made me feel like they were trying to hide things/mistakes/unclean dishes :p

Service - Our waiter was excellent!  He provided great recommendations and was very informative, without going overboard and being overly chatty.  

Parking was a little bit of a hassle.  There's valet that gets pretty backed up and there's not a whole lot of street parking available."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times in the past and always liked it.  Yesterday I was not as impressed with the food.  I ordered the Ohio Beef Burger along w/ 3 other people at my table.  Each one of us felt queasy later that night.  The burger tasted fine but to be honest, it was not worth the $15 I spent on it.  I have had better burgers at Five Guys.  If you want a good burger at Greenhouse and are feeling adventurous, try the Lamb Burger.  It's much tastier than the beef burger.

The service was really great, though.  Our server was very friendly & attentive to our table.  I haven't ever had bad service at this place, so at least you can expect to be treated well when you are eating here.  

I am willing to give them another try though, but probably not for a while, and probaby not with the burger."}
{"text":"Read so much about this place and not just in Cleveland so went with the family. The layout of this place is amazing, phenomenal use of the space! The service was great but the menu is very perplexing. This is a \"green\" restaurant allegedly because it uses locally grown ingredients and locally raised meat. though not necessarily organic and not necessarily humane. Case in point the veal and foie gras on the menu which I found peculiar.

Now I have no moral stance, just found it bizarre at a predominantly vegetarian and allegedly \"green\" place to feature two such polarizing menu items like veal and foie gras. Granted, I ordered the veal and it was GREAT! All the food was great, the chef's sampler special thingy is the best option on the menu to try as much as you can and stuff your face full of delicious food. I think they might want to re-examine their \"mission statement\" because honestly, it doesn't make any sense at all and just makes the whole idea sound stupid.

This doesn't affect the food and most people I'm sure wouldn't notice, but I found it bizarre (and the veal is delicious!)."}
{"text":"Delicious and so interestingly different that I would go back several times to try more of the offerings.

Atmosphere - fun and a bit funky and on the louder side but not too loud, smaller than I expected, almost a tongue-in-cheek don't take yourself too seriously but sit down for some really good food.

Service - also a bit funky, not too formal, matched the restaurant.

Food - we started with the crispy chicken wings confit which were so delicious not in a buffalo way but almost asian and I'm not even sure what made them so good but they were; we were there in the fall and tried specials including a cooked in parchment (en papier) local mushrooms drenched in butter and lovely mushroom flavor; a lamb pate of sorts that was my least favorite as am not a big meat eater and while a bite or two of this was meaty and delicious a plate of it was too much for me; and my favorite a fish with buttery sauce and gnocchi that was the best I've ever had so that I'd love to find the recipe and have made gnocchi (not as good) myself twice since.

Pricing - the pricing is fantastic to me compared to Pittsburgh prices. Even the wine and beer offerings were priced very fairly and included interesting and delicious choices.

Location - this little downtown street is blocked to traffic and has some live music and other restaurants. We went to Lola for dessert at the bar and another drink which I also highly recommend."}
{"text":"Eh. Service was quick and pleasant. I guess I was expecting more from the food side of things. We had the wings- they fell off the bone just by touching them but had overall good flavor. 

I was most disappointed in the price for the amount of food when you order from the \"big/dinner portions\". I had the pork chop, which was served with mashed potatoes. There were 5 bite size pieces of pork served with approximately 4 tablespoons of potatoes. The plate itself was 4X as large as the food it held. The pork chops were good, but not enough for ~$30. I don't care how \"good\" something tastes if my stomach doesn't realize food had been put into it. 

I shouldn't spend ~$95 for drinks and food but then leave hungry. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great cocktails, great vibe. Friends of mine introduced me to this place and told me that the creme brûlée would bring me to tears. It's easily the best dessert I've had anywhere. Just recommended it to clients of mine who were in town from New Jersey and they loved it; high praise from people that have a third home in NYC. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Had dinner/ snacks here last night. Everything awesome as usual. Dave was our bartender. He's great!!! Our drinks, food, and dessert were all perfect. I've never been let down at Greenhouse. Still one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland! Foie gras clams, wings, and the pork chop are a few of my faves. Still trying to get the balls to order the pig head...Ill post when i do!"}
{"text":"Really really quite good. Just make sure to have a stress test first, because this food is rich, rich, rich. And if you go for offal, or heads of pig, that advise goes triple. Fortunately, there are good options for the more squeamish, or the more vegetarian minded folks.

That said, everything was really nicely dialed in. A Hipster place and environment that still has good food. I like the upstairs--you can scope out the full scene. Lots of good organic and local grub, awesome wines. You can't help but have a good time."}
{"text":"Underwhelming given the hype this restaurant has received. Service was slow. Beet cured mackeral was completely flavorless. Chucuturie plate was a joke and plated as such. Beef jerkey looked more like a small piece of sausage. Clams were served with burned (not charred) toast. Entrees weren't bad but you could clearly see technical flaws likely from a lack of knowledgeable cooks (or a lack of attention to detail)."}
{"text":"Dad's tomato sandwich was just okay ..sorry I thought it would have more of a tomato taste"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile and was happy to finally get there. Neat inside, vintage bicycles were hanging from the ceiling and there were different levels to be seated on. However, it was very dark and extremely loud. My boyfriend and I had to practically scream to hear each other. Very trendy scene but it was cool that the restaurant attacked a diverse and ecliptic crowd. You could get away with wearing anything to this place- from ripped up jeans and a t-shirt to fancy dresses and heels- it was all there. 
For food we started out with the bread sampler plate. It was pretty disappointing, the bread was awesome but none of the assortments of dips they provided were really that good. It seems like they change up the dip selection so I guess this appetizer could be hit or miss. Next we got the chicken wings and they were so amazing. Literally the best chicken wings I have ever had. They had a nice spice to them without being too much. It was also a good sized portion, nicely filled up my boyfriend and I. For dinner I got the cheeseburger and fries. The fries were absolutely delicious but the burger was nothing special much to my dismay. Overall, the chicken wings were so good that I would come back but try something a little more adventures for my main course."}
{"text":"I'm a minority among the other reviewers.   I am so not a fan of this restaurant.  I've given it the benefit and tried it twice.  The food selection is gamey and very heavy.  Several friends and colleagues have commented the same to me.  Be prepared to pour over the menu and figure out what your palate will be able to enjoy.   Head over to Crop and you will have a much better dining experience -- outstanding menu creation (farm to table)."}
{"text":"I've been there two times and both times the service was alright. The first time was for my 24th birthday but the waiter didn't even acknowledge me when my mom asked about the drinks. I understand I'm a petite woman and look young for my age but he still didn't even apologize or anything once my mother stated I was old enough to drink. The second time I was there they forgot my food. Once my food did come out my order of fries weren't even fries. It was bits and pieces of fry ends. 

The interior design is amazing! I love how unique it looks."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern is a beer lover's dream. Featuring top-of-the-line drinks, tasty food, and sitting in one of the trendiest areas to hang out in Cleveland. 

The Ohio Beef Burger is Greenhouse's try at a gourmet burger and is paired with a brioche bun, raclette cheese & cornichon relish. The bun is well toasted, the cheese is flavorful, and the relish was a nice touch. However, the gooeyness of the cheese and the softness of the tomato led to an odd texture combination. The flavor profile of the burger was pretty neutral and could have used some seasoning to give it a mouthwatering effect. My side of poutine fries and my tasty beer were excellent, still making the Greenhouse Tavern worth a trip."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have only been to this restaurant once, and that was for lunch. Your dinner mileage might vary.

Before it even opened, I'd started hearing a lot of wonderful things about this restaurant. And yet, it's taken me quite a while to get there, and I went there with some real skepticism. The farm to table ethos is deeply compelling, as are the many green accolades the restaurant has received. Clearly Sawyer takes local food seriously. And people rave about the cooking. 

Still, I'd hesitated for a personal reason: I found it impossible to square the designation of this as a \"certified green\" restaurant with its heavy reliance on animal products. Setting aside the cruelty issue, meat production is associated with environmental degradation, deforestation, methane pollution, etc. etc. So how in the world could any restaurant serving beef, fois gras, bacon, etc., be green?? Still, I accept that they make many efforts to be greener than most, and obviously for that they should be commended. Buying locally is always better than shipping products across the globe, whether those products are hog's heads or herbs, right? I'll continue to choose not to eat animals, but it's not as if I only patronize vegetarian restaurants. But there was another catch: there are actually very few vegetarian items even on the menu! This irritated me even more. But eventually, I decided to get over myself, and go see what the fuss was all about. If I had to eat the one vegetarian item to find out, so be it.

My first impression was not great, because the welcome from the hostess was, at best, lukewarm, bordering on utterly indifferent. It was pretty off-putting. The atmosphere inside didn't seem very aesthetically coherent--too dark, an odd mix of materials, an unpleasant long narrow setting--but the outside patio was lovely so we sat there. 

The service was adequate but also disappointing. Both of the waiters who came by were excessively casual and seemed quite uninformed about the food. Questions about what was in certain dishes were met with very vague replies, which was totally inscrutable: doesn't this place pride itself on its ingredients? Being told that a certain dish had x, y,  and \"some other vegetable, I don't know\" was not impressive. Likewise, I was unable to learn for certain whether the soup had cream or a lighter-fat dairy. The waiter offered that \"this cook always says he uses no cream, but that's a lie, he does.\" I'm not allergic to dairy and I'm not vegan, but I do try to watch what I eat and do want to know what's in my food. So the lack of information was unimpressive. We ordered the soup anyway--there really just weren't that many other vegetarian items to choose from--but I wanted the waiter to be more courteous and informative.

After all that, I'm pleased to say I was very pleasantly surprised by the food. Again, this was just lunch, so I wasn't expecting fireworks. But the salad was fresh and lovely, the chick pea sandwich was very very good (though the pita bread was soggy), and--yes!--soup of the day was just out of this world delicious (answer to question: yes, there must be cream). It was described as being a miso soup with carrots, unknown vegetables, cream--i.e. it sounded perfectly meh. But the taste! Ambrosia. A warm, salty, sweet, nearly carmelized brew with the flavors so perfectly balanced that I was unable to identify any of them. YUM. I skipped the dessert but tasted my friend's pot de creme, which was also delicious. 

The upshot: I want to taste more of this food, and will return for dinner to see what else Sawyer can do. If the soup and dessert were any indication, he's a real genius with balancing flavors. But I do hope I return to a more educated waitstaff and a broader range of vegetarian selections."}
{"text":"Poor service. Overpriced food. Went here for the wings after reading they were one of nations best...hooters has better wings. And bigger (no joke extremely tiny, and I had two meatless bones in wing basket),  they were also bone dry.  Waited 20 minutes for waitress to come by for order, then after waiting an hour after ordering entree, we asked for it to go. Will not be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and have a drink. I had the crispy chicken wings confit and pommes frites for a quick lunch. Service was very friendly and timely. Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awful service, awful food!! Not worth the money! Would never go there again. How could you run out of the soup of the day at noon? Not gluten free friendly. Server had no clue."}
{"text":"I took my first voyage to the greenhouse tavern and was less than impressed.  I did the four course meal for $44. The first course, crispy hominy, was drowning in lemon juice.  Eating it was like sucking on a lemon.  Typically limes are a garnish and lightly squeezed on this dish.  I could have drank the citrus juice.  The second course was good and recommended, kale in some yogurt sauce.  But again, nothing to write home about.  For my main entree I ordered their signature pig head, but they were out on a Saturday night.  It seemed odd to be out of a signature dish on a Saturday night.  So I got steak, it was a good piece of meat and well prepared.  Then came time to order the chocolate cake, which they were also out of.  In sum: of the four courses I ordered, Greenhouse was out of 2, and one was terrible.  if you're out on East 4th, I would recommend another restaurant, perhaps Chinato?"}
{"text":"Klasse Essen  jedem zu empfehlen! Netter Service, leicht gehobene Preise, die sich durchaus rechtfertigen. Immer wieder gerne!"}
{"text":"My college friends and I had a reunion over July 4 weekend and decided to check out Greenhouse Tavern on Saturday night. Considering it was a holiday weekend, we (and the server) were surprised  by how relatively not-busy it was. 

Food: 
Most entrees are in the ~$20s range, but portion sizes were pathetically small. I didn't come here expecting Cheesecake Factory-style gluttony, but for the price I paid, I hoped I could leave with a satisfied stomach.

I ordered their beet fettucine, which can be made vegan for those interested (not for me, though). While the flavors were great, there was no way to justify the price for that tiny bit of pasta (which didn't even contain any meat or other obviously \"expensive\" ingredients). The $12 oysters appetizer came with 3 oysters-- is $4 a pop really worth it? My friends say no. The pommes frites were good, though. Three people in my party shared one order of ribs, which turned out to be the most worthwhile entree ($45 but meant to be shared by many). Because of how rich it was, they actually had trouble finishing the dish. 

That said, the menu contains some very intriguing dishes. My friends who got the ribs originally meant to order the pig head (whoa, that's different), but the restaurant had run out by the time we were there (about mid-evening). Try a weekday evening instead if you want to order one of their limited-quantity dishes.

Service:
Service was solid. Water glasses were promptly refilled throughout the evening, and our server was very friendly. Our server actually calculated our check wrong and left off the $45 ribs. As ripped off as we already felt at the end of the evening, it just didn't sit right with our conscience to not mention it, so we brought it up and paid the full amount.

Overall:
I really wanted to like this restaurant, I really did. It's in a cool part of town, and I had heard great things about it throughout my last 6 years in Cleveland. It's one of those places you're supposed to take out-of-town guests to woo them into loving Cleveland. Unfortunately, this just didn't do it for me. The restaurant is fine, but the discrepancy between price and what we actually got left me disappointed in the overall experience. I realize I'm biased given my student status, so I don't have the luxury of wining and dining with such freedom as do my working friends, but even others in my party agreed it was a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Eh. It was okay. The pork chop was interesting. Lots of different flavors I didn't expect. As for the desserts, take a pass. I really wanted sweet or at least good chocolate. The \"choc\" cake was spicy and the dessert I got with the caramel cake tasted sour. Not what I was expecting at all for an $80 bill. The ambiance inside was awesome though despite the beggars outside."}
{"text":"I wanted to take a bath in the beet soup. The fried smelt was awesome too."}
{"text":"We had my sons rehearsal dinner in one of the private spaces at Greenhouse Tavern last Friday night. I can't begin to say how great our evening was. First of all the food was absolutely delicious; the atmosphere was incredible, and the staff so great. We have eaten here several times before and have never been disappointed, so this was the choice for this special dinner.  They certainly did not disappoint. Thanks so much Corey!"}
{"text":"eally interesting place, bit of a work out to get to the bathrooms. We had the meat version- Some of meals were a complete miss, others such as the heart and the \"his\" dinner were absolutely delicious. The waiter was nice but overall the service was confusing and mismatched. 

We spent over 3 hours trying to get through the meal with workers dropping food off in front of us with no explanation of what was being put in front of us. The waiter had said he'd leave a menu to follow along and then promptly took mine that i had set aside, leaving us with no \"cheat sheet\" the menu it self was just titles with no explanations of the actual meals. The courses came in no particular order and when I actually stopped a...\"bus boy\" maybe? that had just set something down in front of me i asked, what is this? response- \"Uh, I don't know, I'll find out\" never to return. We ended up with duplicate courses, half courses, missed a course (i'm thinking it was the torte one). The wine didn't match up with the meals i'm assuming since the wine never came with the meal, it was after we finished a plate or long before the next one arrived, then finally at 11:15pm when we hadn't seen our waiter in a good 30mins, the restaurant pretty much empty, other workers moving to fast to stop and ask when do we get the bill?
My boyfriend had said he had to use his credit card to make the reservation, maybe its like a few other dinners we had gone to where we pre-paid for our meals and were charged the next day after attending \"special\" dinners. So we left, got a call 10 mins later to come back and pay, which we promptly did. When I explained what happened there was a blank stare, a shrug and a mummbled sorry. 

For $250 for two people, gratuity included, no explanation of the meals, cold air blowing up my dress the entire time from a floor vent, it wasn't worth it and left a bitter taste in my mouth. 

To boot, don't go by anything anyone says on their fb page because if you're not raving about the place they'll just delete the review and ignore you. Just like at the restaurant, go figure."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, as I have a few friends who really love GHT...however, things didn't turn out that way.  We did the tasting menu, which is actually a good deal when you look at the pricing of the individual courses.  The highlight of the meal was the first course, with a simple grilled bread and fromage blanc.  And unfortunately, it went downhill from there.

Bottom line, they don't know how to cook a steak, and the food was just mediocre.  When you order a steak medium, then send if back because it is beyond rare, then it is brought back to you barely medium-rare...unacceptable.  You have to know how to cook a steak, and you have to fix it if you get it wrong.

With so many other good places in town, next time I will go somewhere that can cook a steak correctly."}
{"text":"Great beers the pommes frites are very tasty and the wings fall right off the bone awesome service as well"}
{"text":"I came here post-lunch for a drink. I had a cocktail with artichoke liquor, cranberry juice and Ginger beer. Really refreshing and different! 

My husband had 3 beers, all recommended by our bartender. All 3 were excellent, as the bartender proved to be very knowledgable about beer. My home brewer husband really appreciated the service!

We didn't have anything to eat, but if the food is anything like the drinks, it will surely not disappoint."}
{"text":"Went here back in May for lunch. I loved it. We had the bread board with the tasting of butters and animal fats. God was that good. I couldnt get enough of the suet spread. AMAZING!

I followed that up with the bbq corned beef sandwich which was perfect. The combination of the french bread, perfectly cooked corned beef and accompanying sauce was very satisfying. I ordered a side of the gravy fries, which was also very good although I wished the fries were more crispy. 

And to finish off this pig out fest I had one of the best desserts of my life, a johnycake with dolce de leche caramel and hominy ice cream. I cant say enough about how delicious, inventive and well executed this dessert was. This was some serious next level stuff. 

Our server was very polite and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. What a great experience all around."}
{"text":"Okay, this is going to sound hyperbolic but the food here is easily some of the best I've ever had!!! I don't normally use exclamation points but that's how emphatic I am about my experience. I came here for a late lunch with my hubby on a weekday & it was busy but not crowded, filled with mostly the business crowd. Our server was very attentive, the atmosphere is cozy & casual but with an upscale vibe. 

But what really matters is the food, right? So let's get to it: It was incredible & I am not even remotely exaggerating. The real reason we tried Greenhouse is because my husband was hankering for poutine (french fries smothered in gravy & cheese) & it's the only local place we knew that had it. I  would describe the food as bold flavor combinations made from the freshest ingredients. I had the PLT (a BLT with pimento cheese & goat cheese). With the bacon, crusty grilled bread & a rich tomato dipping sauce, it was a delicious flavor explosion in my mouth. My husband had the lamb burger and couldn't even speak to me during the meal because he was so focused on his food. This would be a great place for a business lunch or to take a date or small group of friends."}
{"text":"Went here at the recommendation of the hotel I was staying at, and it is awesome! The ambiance is funky cool, and the food was awesome. The wings and the Brussels sprouts both lived up to their reputation! The wings were not your typical ones, they were very small but very well prepared - moist chicken - and the herbs used excellent. The sprouts were cut and roasted I think so you had charred edges - they ROCKED! the lemony sauce they came with was delicious! 

The steak tartar is not the typical recipe and comes deconstructed - not what I expected, and I could tell some the \"real\" recipe. Well, don't be put off by that because it was an excellent take on it and I *loved* it!!! The meat was tender and fresh, all the ingredients thoughtfully prepared in the right quantities. Big thumbs up to it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this restaurant did not live up to its hype.  I live on the west coast and was in Cleveland for the weekend.   I had a reservation for two but because my companion's flight was cancelled, I was a solo woman.  When I showed up at the restaurant, I was told that my table was occupied and wouldn't be ready for quite a long time.  Then, I was informed that a table in the bar area was available and that this particular table was my \"reserved\" table.  I then proceeded to watch couples be seated.  At one point, a forty-something couple entered, asked for a table but was told by the twenty-something year old hostess that none were available.  However, a table was available about 10 minutes later for a party closer to her age who appeared without a reservation.  This kind of spoils an evening.   I can only hope that the 20 year old is treated similarly when she ages.  Food was OK but kind of heavy.  Too much vinegar on the Greenhouse salad and too much caramel on the Pot de Creme."}
{"text":"One of the best parts of being in a depopulated city is that restaurants are actively trying to bring out the crowds on week nights. Hence Greenhouse Tavern has their excellent happy hour and late night menu, which just goes above and beyond. A particularly comment-worthy item is the steak tartare, which is grass fed beef that is hand chopped into pieces and comes with tiny pieces of onion and cornichon along with mayo, mustard, and a poached egg for mixing. Oh, and it also comes with the most delectable fries and aioli. All this for $9. For the house wine, I think we paid $5 a glass. It's a shame we weren't hungrier, because I could have gone for the $5 burger in addition. Certainly, there will be a next time."}
{"text":"I went to the Greenhouse Tavern soon after seeing the Iron Chef episode that pitted Geoffrey Zakarian against Jonathon Sawyer, the chef of the restaurant. 

They have a house-made club soda that's actually really good and I highly recommend it. My friend and I both got the Devils on Horseback for \"Firsts,\" which are basically dates wrapped in bacon with almonds, chocolate, and fresno pepper. They were the perfect balance of flavors! We skipped the \"Seconds\" and went straight to the \"Thirds,\" when I ordered the Pig Head (weird, I know, but I was feeling adventurous). It was totally worth it, too! I definitely, definitely recommend trying this dish. It was perfectly roasted and seasoned. My friend got the Fried Flintstone Beef Short Rib, which he reported was really good too. For dessert we had Buttered Popcorn Pot de Creme, which is basically just really salty and caramel-y popcorn. While highly unhealthy, it was absolutely delicious. 

Seriously, go to the Greenhouse Tavern. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My in-laws brought me here for a belated birthday celebration last month. Well, Happy Birthday to me! I had one of the best meals of my life and I've had some darn goooood meals in my day. 

Greenhouse Tavern provides a fun, unique take on awesome ingredients, like the pig face for example. Yup. It had teeth and a snout and it was DELICIOUS. Fear not the pig face. It tastes like the best pulled pork you've ever had. It's huge (it's basically an entire head) so I recommend sharing. I also snagged a bite (or 5) of my sister-in-law's beef shin. They serve it in a trough (again portion sizes are generous!) and this thing was incredible. The table shared the bacon wrapped dates, crispy hominy and chicken wings. All delicious. 

The dark wood gives the space a warm, cozy feel.  It's definitely a place I could go to grab a drink and a bite or sit back and enjoy a long meal. Greenhouse Tavern, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"OH, MY GOODNESS!! Delicious kale salad, dressing on the side, with veggie patty is righteous! Chardonnay on the side. Sitting in the window people watching is the best on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Service could not have been better

Wife and I went down without a reservation, put our names in, told an hour 15 minute wait, and went to get some beers.

Called very quickly, and we're even understanding when I told them we're in no hurry, and would wait for another table. Finished our beers and headed back over. Got sat after about an hour wait, total.

Ordered the pigs head, with a side of fries. Tabasco fried chicken for an app cause they said and we knew it would be a while.  Chicken came out quickly, a little too, with the long wait ahead, but was awesome.

Awhile later our fries showed up... but a few minutes go by, no pigs face... and then front of house manager... he explained that he had a crying girl in the office because she dropped the pig on the way up the stairs. They said the already put in an app for us and they would get another one going a quick as possible.

Animal fries came out. They were awesome. Pigs face showed up, we were a little full, but was awesome too. They insisted they had desserts covered, we were full and had to fight them off. They did an amazing job taking care of us. They comped a bunch of our bill and couldn't have been happier with the food, the atmosphere, and the way the corrected the problem. Keep it up, will be back."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern was amazing.  I just dined there this past Saturday night for a girls night out, and all of us had a fantastic meal.  We had the wings for an appetizer (which they are known for) and they were the best wings I have ever had in my life! Literally all the meat fell off the bone as I picked it up!!!! The meat was so juicy and just the best flavor! We also orderd the Animal Frites.....seriously they were the bomb.....Home made fries, fried in Duck Fat, topped with a delicious gravy, fresh mozzarella cheese, crispy bacon and 2 eggs....it was a dream! I will be back for these fries again! 
For dinner 2 of us had the Steak Frites, and the steak was cooked to perfection, but we couldn't even touch the fries since we had the Frites appetizer..we were so full! One of my friends had the BBQ Pig Head which was absoltely fantastic.  It came out on a silver tray with delicious coleslaw and toasted bread.....you had to peel the head back to get to the meat which was fun! The meat just melted in your mouth...some of the best pork I have ever had! Highly reccommend it!! Over all an amazing meal, ambiance, and the staff was truly phenomenal!! At the end of the meal we ordered \"Kitchen Coffee\" for the kitchen staff which allowed us to carry a tray of much deserved beer downstairs to the kitchen crew.  This was awsome to be able to do this for them, and anyone who has worked in kitchen before will know how nice it is to have this done for you! Give recognition to those you cooked you a great meal and get them a beer!!!"}
{"text":"Great little hipster joint.  The decor is very cool and hey have a vintage vibe.  I ordered the sour Shirley because egg white seemed like an interesting ingredient.  The bartender assured us it made a nice foam.  Sure enough it was fabulous and I ordered another.  The strip steak was super tender and the rosemary on the French fries was a delicious touch. We parked ourselves at the bar and noticed the staff and patrons alike were pleasant.  Go here and try something new!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried lamb steak was served literally raw in the middle. I frequently eat meat rare or medium rare, and this was raw. Of course the kitchen replaced the food, but the experience of being served raw lamb ruined the evening completely. It was an expensive, awful meal, one that I would never consider repeating."}
{"text":"Think I got charged the \"tourist\" price for a tap beer. Bottles and cans were listed at $5-$6 and my tap rang up to $7 plus tax."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at the Greenhouse Tavern last evening.  Both the service and the food were outstanding.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of Cleveland's best restaurants. The rosemary garlic fries are to die for too."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Love the mural. Love the drinks. LOVE the food. Love the service.
I think it's great to see a menu that changes according to harvests. Reading about their ideas and initiatives reminded me that Cleveland really can be a forward-thinking city with the ability to blaze trails.
Every trip I make downtown will be punctuated with a visit here. Can't wait to try the new patio!
PS  I want to marry the goat milk & sea salt butter. Really, I do."}
{"text":"The food at Greenhouse Tavern is amazing. I didn't expect such great service or food walking into a \"Tavern\", so don't let the name fool you! 

I had the Chef's Selection and enjoyed every bit of it. The service was also great and we enjoyed dinner out and will recommend to everyone.

{"text":"4 stars because it's in Cleveland, 3 if it were in New York (where I'm from).

The bottom line:
Good food. Great philosophy.

Pros:
- the bread and butter is AMAZING.
- creative ideas (turnip and apple appetizer was delicious)

Cons:
- Ravioli with tomato sauce was delicious, but I was served maybe eight 1 inch square pieces. It was not enough for an entree. I ate it in like two bites, and finished long before my two fellow diners. Was rather surprising and a disappointment. It was also $17.
- Dessert... wasn't anything special. Didn't match up to the food. We shared the chocolate bread pudding (bland), the peanut butter sandwich (shortbread cookies didn't fit very well with the ice cream, I felt - chewy would have been better!), and the tarte tatin. The tarte tatin was good but could have used more crust (the best part!)"}
{"text":"Great food that's overpriced. Everything we ate was very delicious. Service was great. But $8 dollars for 5 tater tots? $8 for 5 fish sticks that are the size of a pinky finger??

Bottom line. Everything is great besides the pricing on certain plates."}
{"text":"Went before tribe game on 7/5, used opentable and had to change reservation last minute. Couldn't have been more helpful and receptionist was great. even tho we all coursed out with no alcohol sales the service couldnt have been better. Sloppy Jo nut is a must have... One of the best dishes in the city!! foie gras and clams THE best dish in c-town no doubt. Can't speak highly enough about how the service staff bends over backwards to make u feel welcome there. Destination place for sure"}
{"text":"Over Christmas I went here with a friend, and boy am I glad that I did.  I  grew up in Cleveland and now live in NYC.  I am so happy to be able to go home and find good food when I do.  This place was terrific.  I got the half a chicken, covered in breaded awesomeness. I had the shredded cabbage and the bacon wrapped dates. This place was amazing.  I would put it up there with a lot of the better restaurants in NY.  The service was great the food was terrific and the location is ideal. All at Cleveland prices, which for someone living in NYC is so cheap!  If you are just visiting the Cleve or if you are from there and looking for someplace new to try out, I would highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been impressed every time I've come. I love that Cleveland has a restaurant that has excellent food but still maintains a casual atmosphere.

As a vegetarian, I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've tried, although the last time I did have the unfortunate experience that they were out of two of the vegetarian items. I understand that it happens, but it is slightly frustrating when your choices are so limited. However, what I did eat was delicious. I recommend getting two \"firsts\" or \"seconds\" or taking half of your entree home, as the entrees are huge! I'm impressed at what a good value you get for all the food. The Brussels Sprouts were AMAZING - who knew this humble vegetable could be so good? The stuffed peppers were also great and tasted perhaps even better as leftovers the next day. 

The service was excellent - our server was extremely friendly and was very helpful in accommodating my friend who has a gluten allergy. I would suggest that the restaurant be more transparent on the menu itself about which items are gluten-free, but the kitchen was very honest about how everything was prepared.

I also loved that the house wine is Sineann. Typically, house wine is basically the cheapest plonk possible, but Sineann is wonderful wine, and it is unheard of to get a terrific bottle of house wine for under $40.

I'm bummed that I missed out on the rooftop patio season this year, but I can't wait to try it next year!"}
{"text":"location/ambience are unbeatable, but unfortunately the food is hit-or-miss. The French fries and main plates are mostly delicious. The vegetarian offerings, on the other hand, seem to be provided as an afterthought -- sometimes the sauces/seasonings of the vegetarian plates are off the mark, and sometimes the ingredients do not match what's on the menu (biggest disappointment: ordering kale salad and getting mixed greens with a few pieces of baby kale). If you want good vegetarian food and don't mind a more improvised atmosphere, a better option is right around the corner: Helio Terra on Prospect."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've never had something here that I didn't love.  Especially the chicken wings confit, they will change your life!  The animal frites are pretty amazing as well, poutin raised to an art-form.  The menu changes regularly, which just means you'll want to come back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"One of favorite restaurants in Cleveland! Highly recommend! Everything I've had here has been out of this world.  And you must save room for dessert and get the Pot De Creme.  Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. We stopped in Cleveland for an overnight visit and walked down to the East 4th Street area on a recommendation from our hotel. We took a quick walk around and spotted Greenhouse Tavern, which had been recommended to us by a friend before we left, so in we went. The outdoors area was packed on a Wednesday night, but the four of us were seated at a community table on the patio area - which they didn't mention was a community table, but it didn't really matter.

The menu was small, but packed with highlights. We started with the bread and butter board, as well as Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) to share. For my main course, I had the strip steak, which was juicy and flavorful, and the party also ordered a burger, walleye pasta, and steak tartare, and the 'very spicy greens and beans' which was more like kimchi. We had two of the buttered popcorn pot au creme for dessert, which were to die for.

You'd be smart to: Upgrade your frites to 'Animal Style' thereby making them poutine on steroids. Absolutely incredible that even under the weight of brown gravy, fried eggs, mustard, mozzarella cheese curd, and bacon the fries stayed crispy and were just delicious.

You'd be dumb to: Not get the tasting menu. The tasting menu (small appetizer, larger appetizer, entree, and a side or dessert) runs $44 with some small up charges. I managed to spend about $44, and not get that much food. Not that I was underserved by any stretch of the imagination, but if you're looking for value, it's a good one.

You could go either way on: The atmosphere. I didn't mind it, but it's about as hip/trendy/hipsterville as I ever expected to find in Cleveland. If you're the kind of person who is bothered by that, you've been warned."}
{"text":"My group of 4 was very excited to try Greenhouse Taven and Chef Sawyer's food.  After reading all the reviews about the tasting menu, we were looking forward to trying it.  Unfortunately, the tasting menu increased to $44, which is not that expensive, but if you add up the four courses individually, it is not much of a savings.  It is also possible to be overcharged if you pick 4 less priced options.  The Devil's on Horseback were amazing!  The pommes frites were just like Bar Cento and very good. The animal frites were interesting, but a little soggy.  They also had an undisclosed upcharge of $3 we weren't made aware of until the bill came.  Also, only I ordered the tasting menu which I got $51 of food for the $47 price after the upcharge.  Another member of our party got charged $44 for the tasting menu even though they ordered individually.  They only got $40 of food for the $44 price because they ordered cheaper menu items.  The food is amazing but they need to disclose upcharges and not charge you for a tasting menu if it would be cheaper individually."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting from out of town.  Wait staff was friendly and helpful.  Decent atmosphere but very loud in the whole restaurant, making it difficult to hear others at my table.  Fun decor with bikes everywhere.

Food is supposed to be locally sourced and seasonal.  They were out of two items our party wanted which was disappointing. I tasted the edamame, wings, fries, and beef burger. All were well flavored and enjoyable although nothing I'd make it a point to return for.  Prices seem super high....$19 for a beef burger?!  I have had equally good burgers for much less.

Bottom line:  decent food, but rather pricey."}
{"text":"Revisiting: quick & to the point

Foods: 
1st: Chips & Dip---over priced for something I can make at home.

2nd: Egg Omelet---local eggs, cream cheese & herbs, eh:/ it's not worth $11. 

3rd: NON-MEAT EATERS BEWARE: STOP READING NOW!
Roasted pigs head: \"shrimp paste BBQ, raw vegetable salad, shallot mignonette, lime wedges & lettuce cups\" The fat is melt in your mouth good. Literally. Pick & poke for meats (hint: buccinator muscle) put on the bun, drizzle some BBQ on top, slap on a bit of slaw= pull pork sandwich :) The skin is delicious.

I feel a little ripped off; the ears & eyes were missing. They incorporated the ears in another dish. 

4th: As always; pot de cream. Sweet & savory; rich velvety chocolate, caramel and sea salt.

Drinks:  \"Not your daddy's vodka\"--- it's slightly fruity and light. I didn't think it was very good; the \"Manhattan\"---mostly bourbon with a cherry top; strong & good."}
{"text":"As a network television photographer I was asked to grab some insert shots of chef Jonathon Sawyer for an upcoming segment on Iron Chef.   Leaving without dinner was not an option for me since  Im a foodie and miss my food network days on a previous show.   The menu was possibly the most interesting food selection I have ever seen.  The animal style frites and whole grilled pardon peppers were tremendous.  The Halibut and pork dishes  were great but no human being on earth should ever, ever leave this place without trying the BUTTERED POPCORN POT DE CREME WITH CARAMEL & SEA SALT.   The first bite just blew me away.  In all my years of covering food, this was possibly the best dessert I have ever tasted.  The staff was fantastic, friendly and helpful and Jonathan was such a fun guy to be around.   I\"m going back with the family next time!"}
{"text":"Was there for the first time, and it is easily my favorite restaurant in Cleveland! First off I love the feel of the place. It's fantastic food and a homey feel. My father and I sat in the balcony. We started off with the oysters. They were fresh and tasty we put their homemade hot sauce on and it was money. Next we had the animal style fries. I've had a lot of fries but the combination of eggs, gravy, and mustard tied it all together. For dinner I had the short rib. That was tender and had tons of flavor. The fat on it melted in my mouth. The portion was huge and could have easily fed 2 adults. For dessert we shared the popcorn pot de le creme. It was the tastiest thing I've ever put in my mouth it was creamy and delicious. I would go back tomorrow if I had a bigger wallet!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for one night. I'm a big time foodie and work in the industry so I did my research on where to have dinner. I decided upon greenhouse tavern. It did not disappoint. Everything was fantastic. I ordered the pork cooked 3 ways! The pork belly was unreal. I'd pay just to eat that again. My girlfriend ordered the walleye. The skin on this fish was so delicious! I'd recommend both items. Their craft cocktails are also very delicious. Our server Jon was very kind and knowledgeable. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Probably the all around best meal that I've had in a long time.

To start, I had the wings which were completely fall off the bone delicious and very well could be some of the best wings I've ever had. For my main course, I had the Delmonico steak which couldn't have been any better and for desert I had this Carmel popcorn desert which I would fly across 7 states on the wings of a Pterodactyl and wade through flooding rivers dragging a parachute to have again."}
{"text":"The Animal Style Frites w/ bacon, two fried eggs, whole grain mustard, mozzarella cheese curd were amazing!  Definitely a meal for two or an appetizer for many.  The pig shaped plate was cute too.  Eat light before you go."}
{"text":"Good pork-centric restaurant. We had the lamb burger and the rabbit Ragu. Even the rabbit has smoked pork belly! The lamb burger was literally one of the best burgers I've ever had. The grilled romain Cesar is made with house made garlic-beer vinegar. It's awesome.  Not a lot of green here but everything that we ate was really well done."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern I'd say deserves 3.5 stars. Definitely has its own unique vibe,  think a cross between library and bike messager turned bar. 
The service I thought was disappointing. Not real friendly,  not rude by any means but didn't smile or seem like they cared one way or another. 
I had the Lamb burger, very expensive for a burger but really good.  
Definitely worth checking out and planning a meal there."}
{"text":"burger was terrible. salad was ok. both not seasoned properly. their homemade ketchup was disgusting."}
{"text":"I paid 28 dollars for about 50 cents worth of spaghetti, 3 clams and 3 oysters. Overall poor food, expect to leave the place hungry. Other than good service, there's not much more to this place other than a nice location"}
{"text":"Very conflicted on the 3 Stars. Because I think food quality is the most important attribute, they get 3 stars. I have enjoyed everything I have eaten there and the wings are a truly crave-able item. Everything else about Greenhouse is 1 Star at best.  Over the top trendster decor and vibe, horribly over priced, and the worst clueless hipster service you could dream up"}
{"text":"Awesome! Celebrated friend's birthday before Tribe game. Perfect location! Service was very attentive. Short ribs are ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great food.  I got the pan fried pork chop.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch! My mother and I went to lunch at Greenhouse Tavern. 

We ordered the pumpkin pasta, chicken wings confit, and cauliflower soup with a kale salad. All were delicious! I finished my pumpkin pasta in less than 15 minutes and would go back for some more. It was served with an egg and bread crumbs--YUM! The chicken wings confit were tasty too; they were covered with garlic and green onions. My mothers soup and salad were great (except the kale salad was a little salty)."}
{"text":"Thought about going somewhere else and glad I didn't. The Greenhouse tavern has the best wings ever! Seriously just fall off the bone. Oh, and they have great beer. Don't think twice about coming here! Ask for Elena!!!"}
{"text":"The food is overrated and I was not impressed. They do not cater to the customer's tastes, rather they tell you what you can have. Example, can I replace the cheese on my burger (some pungent variety) for another sort I see on your menu (cheddar)? No, I can not. The chef will omit the cheese, but refuses to use the kind I like. Unless you are looking for something to complain about, avoid this tourist trap."}
{"text":"A meaty gastro-fest that is so fun, even burst pipes pouring water out of  the ceiling in another corner of the hipster-barn interior enhances the experience!  Said our nonplussed waiter: \"Oh, you've just experienced Cleveland winter at it's finest!\" 

This is an experimental carnivore and frites kitchen that also makes tender, beautiful handmade pasta which isn't that surprising since we found Greenhouse Tavern via Bon Appetit's list of 50 Best New Restaurants.  

We wish they'd add a few more green greens, but otherwise we can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped here an hour and a half before a show we were attending at HOB.  We were sat in the window area which was a little chilly but a cool location to people watch.  We had never been so the waiter went over the menu and got us our drinks.  Then we didn't see him for almost 20 minutes, this was after we had been there for 20 minutes already.  I was excited to try some of the interesting things on the menu but when we couldn't find him realized we were not going to have time to order a full meal.  We were close to getting up and asking one of the hosts for the check and leaving when he finally came back to our table.  We ordered a plate of the fries and made it clear that we were now in a hurry and he apologized.  About 10 minutes later he came up with the fries as well as three other appetizers for us to try on the house to make up for his absence.
The food was outstanding.  The fries were covered in gravy and mozzarella cheese (which my boyfriend calls disco fries, i guess this is a Jersey thing?) which were fantastic.  We also got to try the Devil's on Horseback (dates wrapped in bacon) which were great and I've never had a date that I actually liked, Crispy Hominy which was good but had a bit too much lime juice, and an apple salad which was very refreshing.
I would definitely recommend checking this place out when you have a couple hours to spend at dinner.  Do not plan to split a few of the \"firsts\" for dinner, as they are small and you will still be hungry.  
We will be going back for a proper dinner sometime soon and make a night of it.  Also, you should make a reservation even if it is a weeknight or you'll probably be stuck in the window."}
{"text":"Some one the entrees are tiny... more like an amuse bouche, so make sure you know what you are ordering. 

Everything was delicious, though. Rustic and flavorful. Make sure you get the bread board and don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"3rd time visitor. This place rocks.  On last visit, I started with the radishes - who knew they'd be so good? I went with the wings and foie gras clams as my dinner and egg frites as a side.  I can't describe exactly how delectable and satisfying it all was and how everything just went so well together. The Black Label in cans for $2 was the topper.  The entire place was packed, lively yet our table of 10 was served promptly and courteously.  Every person in our group raved about their experience. Each time I am on the North Coast, Greenhouse is on my list of 'must do's'."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in the greater Cleveland area to not only eat with my wife but to bring every friend or family member from out of town to. Try the Chicken Wings Confiet for an apitizer and the roasted pigs face or Fred Flintstone Rib Steak! Each is enough to share. Make reservations at least one week in advance for prime time dining and reserve the pigs face or rib steak at that time (they have ran out). You will not be disappointed by this place! Atmosphere is hipster and one could show up in casual dress or jeans (I went in cargo shorts and a printed \"T\" for a 9:30 p.m. on a Saturday meal with another couple."}
{"text":"Really like the Greenhouse, I think this is another great addition to Cleveland's restaurant scene.  I am a big fan of Bar Cento and the Fries there, and they have transferred them over here to here as well.   I think the menu in inventive and good, but very specific and some people may not \"get\" it.  Their courses are set up more like small tasting plates and they have a few entree's, but both times I have been there we just got a bunch of stuff to share.  As a lot of people have said, their wings are amazing, love them, they are the perfect combination of breading and crispiness, and dont be worried that they have jalapeno's in the sauce they are not at all spicy, you can just pick around them if you dont like them.  I had the burger once and it was ok, the second time I had the mussels with fries and they were good.  Try the buttered radishes as well, different but good! I really like the fact that they are a \"green\" certified restaurant, and appreciate that the decor is not so much for ambience but for function, but still really stylish. Both times I have been there, the service was great, and the bartenders are very friendly.  I would recommend this place to anyone who is willing to try something new."}
{"text":"Im a fan for sure! We tried a number of different things....the wings are awesome....definitely get them! And I would get them next time for sure. The Lake Erie smelt appetizer was really good....but if you are not a strong fish flavor person, these wouldn't be for you. I had the roasted cauliflower fettucine and my fiance had the pork chop entree. He thought it was good....rich flavoring....and the fettucine was good.....very good flavor. Other people around us got some of the burgers, those looked delish! Oh and we also got the popcorn brulee dessert.....which we decided if we were to go back we could both get the wings, this dessert, and some fun drinks.....those were all of our faves. When we go back, we will def try more of the small plates even though we do think they may be a bit pricey.
Our server was fantastic and the place has great atmosphere. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I loved the street that Greenhouse Tavern is on; you can sit in the interesting indoor space or lounge outside.  I loved that they make a commitment to local produce and businesses.  We had some local hard cider and a saison to drink.  Both were delicious, and it was actually hard to decide given the great beer list.  

As recommended, we had the animal frites to start.  They were decadent!  Fries covered in savory gravy, with thick-cut bacon chunks, melted mozzarella, two fried eggs, and a spectacular whole grain mustard.  I personally thought that they were a bit much, and wouldn't get them again myself, although I definitely see why people love them.  I think they'd be better shared among four people; it was too much food for just my husband and I.

We also had the chickpea wrap and the burger.  The burger was done well and simply to let the grass-fed beef shine, and it was delicious, but it wasn't spectacular.  Just a burger, but with superior beef.  The chickpea wrap was AWESOME!  It's essentially a home-made falafel with pickled veggies to give it some tang and crunch.  I would definitely go back just for the wrap."}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS IN THE WORLD!!! That's all you really need to know. You may come here for the Flintstone ribs, or pork head, or lamb burger, but the wings are the real MVP. My husband and I once drove here during a blizzard, when the city and half the restaurants in it where shut down, just to get wings (parking was great consequently!). Man, I want wings now..."}
{"text":"4th Street is super fun and always bustling after 6 pm. This place had the best chicken wings and fries. I usually hate eating wings on the bone, but the meat was so tender it just fell off. And there's a perfect amount of heat that it doesn't take away from the flavor. We were seated outside on a busy Friday night after an Indians game, so it was obviously pretty loud and our waitress was busy. Other than that, it's a great location with some great food."}
{"text":"With my visit to the Greenhouse Tavern, I've nearly dined at all of the restaurants on E. 4th.  My last holdout is La Strada, but that's neither here nor there.  I went with a girlfriend to discuss some wedding details, and it was absolutely delish.  The service was great, the food was excellent and I left feeling just the right amount of stuffed.

I decided to go with that day's special -- pan-seared halibut over tomato risotto.  Hello!  How could I not?  The fish was flaky, moist and perfectly seasoned.  The risotto was to-die-for and so creamy it's making me drool right now just thinking about.  The dish was topped with a perfect amount of arugula and accented with juicy tomatoes.  Such perfection the first time that I can't wait to visit the Greenhouse Tavern again and again."}
{"text":"Too salty!!!!!   I was warned about this from a friend who had dined there, but had heard other fabulous reviews, so wanted to try it for myself.
The bread board entree was good, but did not include any preserves as described in the menu (and was over-priced).
I ordered the corn carbonera, a pasta dish.   None of us could eat it, it was way too salty AND too peppery.
My daughter had the veggie burger...nothing special and the side salad was unbelievably SALTY.   Salty lettuce?    Just weird!
My husband got the lamb burger.   I thought it was delicious, although he thought it was too pink.   But again, the fries and the dipping sauce were off the charts SALTY.   
We had desserts also.   Vegan chocolate ice-cream was delicious but TINY...about two bites.   My daughter's s'more torte was ok, but even that was too salty!   My walnut ice-cream was good....but not out of the ordinary.
What is all the hype about this place?    Love the philosophy of locally grown organic food etc,   But why cover up the taste of the food with all that SALT??
The atmosphere dining outside is very nice, but the chairs are so uncomfortable!  And too low for the table.
Overall, we were not impressed and do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Loved sitting at the bar foe happy hour. Delicious fresh seafood and fantastic service."}
{"text":"We were Intown for the Coldplay concert and was told by two different people to come to this restaurant. We were not disappointed at all. We had a table right in the window and a fabulous waitress named Tara. We had the brussels sprouts,pork cheeks, octopus and bucatini. I enjoyed the drink of the day which was made with Vodka. The people were great, food is out of this world and none better in service. Come and enjoy, but make reservations"}
{"text":"The meal tonight amazing!!! The chicken wings were zesty and delicious and the Flintstone short ribs were out of this world. Unfortunately I left my blackberry. Fortunately I was incredibly lucky that our fantastic server Christy turned my phone in to the front house manager.  When I panicked later and called it- Christie answered and let me know that she had it at the front and they would hold it for me. The manager Josie us doing a great job there to have such a great team front and back of the house!!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Lame atmosphere. So many better places to eat in Cleveland including McDonald's. Be sure not to be too loud or you'll have to leave. Old people only!"}
{"text":"This is a great farm to table eatery. Fantastic service. Definitely ask about the draft beer not listed on the menu. Beet veggie burger was A+."}
{"text":"My favorite on 4th! I love this place. Have a drink on the roof then settle in for some chicken wings and those crazy loaded fries with eggs and gravy. I have been there many times ~ you have to try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Amazing, knowledgeable waitstaff, incredible dynamic menu, and the best food around. Chicken wings are the best I e ever had and their entrees are fantastic, especially pork chop saltimbocca and strip steak. I love this joint!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, exceptional ambiance and outstanding, delicious food .  It's everything the best reviews have already lumped together in one great amalgamation of yummy goodness.  The pot de creme dessert is one of the best, if not the top, dessert I've ever consumed.  My Ohio burger was top notch and the salad with house buttermilk dressing was insanely edible and perfectly salty to balance the peppery gravy fries we shared."}
{"text":"Love this location right on the revitalized 4th Street area of Cleveland! The interior and the patio both felt cramped, though.

I had the halibut, as well as a mixed green salad.  The halibut was tender and lightly seasoned, and very tasty, and came but the mixed green salad was pretty boring and there was a little too much of the standard oil/vinegar dressing. Service was attentive and friendly, though.

Overall, a nice place to stop by for a drink or bite, but I want to explore other options in Cleveland before heading back here."}
{"text":"Great meal. Recommend the tasting menu. Clams were a standout. 40 day aged steak very good. Walleye cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Creative dishes. Lots of variety. Excellent staff. Order veggie burger, excellent. Husband had a delicious steak tartare. Great drinks.  Had buttered popcorn pot de creme for dessert. Don't let the name fool you. It was awesome. Nothing like popcorn. Just enough for two to satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"We met up with local family for a reunion at The Greenhouse Tavern.  It couldn't have been better, except for a few missing family members! Terrific server paid us just the right amount of attention, helped greatly navigating the incredibly tempting menu.  We sat at a huge high top, opposite the bar, but the busy energetic vibe was toned down enough for all of us to visit and chat, it's all about the background music (low toned, good groove, but not blasting) which enables every guest to hear one another rand not have to shout. The beverage list is a bible, pages of creative offerings, plenty of craft beers on tap, too. Menu designed for tasting, so we all shared some crazy delicious taste treats.  No losers on the table, every dish was clean when it left the table. Too many winners to list. Dessert will send you over the moon though. Go ahead and order one of the desserts, best in the land, I'm sure of it!

We are returning to Greenhouse Tavern , a sure bet!"}
{"text":"I have had a hard time ordering off this menu each and every time I have been there.... but the Beef Tartare has blown my mind to the point that I keep going back and giving the menu a whirl. 

I certainly appreciate the ingenuity of the entire place, and the actual brilliance of the menu, so I will never dis the joint...  

Love the drink menu, love the bathrooms (lol) i.e. the very specific toilets...."}
{"text":"This place is worth driving to. It is seriously the best restaurant I have ever been to. It is gourmet food in a nice relaxed atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The chefs are amazing! I appreciate that they always have plenty of vegetarian options. It is a bit expensive, but you will not soon forget your meal here. My husband and I get the 4 for $44 and then he gets his main coarse which is plenty of food. The menu is seasonal with local ingredients. They have an extensive spirits list to choose from. I love this place more and more each time I go back."}
{"text":"If you are an adventurous eater, this is the spot for you.  Great atmosphere and an eclectic menu."}
{"text":"We met a few of our friends up here to celebrate a birthday.  The food was out of this world!  Drinks were even better.  We each chose a 4 course dinner option and decided to get different items and share.  Every item that came out was delicious, perfectly balanced and well thought out.  I will not go into detail because in total we tried over 14 dishes.  I can confidently say there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.  We also tried quite a few drinks off their menu and my two favorite were the \"not your daddys vodka tonic\" and \"get behind the mule\".  Both were very refreshing and fun :-)"}
{"text":"Been here a ton, weather for a drink or food simply the best restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"After our third fantastic evening here, I am upgrading Greenhouse Tavern to a five! Somehow the food was so good we didn't give a gosh darn about the music."}
{"text":"Great menu that has a variety of different items. Nothing better than having a few drinks and sharing a pig's head with good friends or relatives! The smaller plates were also fantastic and interesting."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, probably the best pork chop I've ever had. Wings were amazing, the bacon date appetizer as well.  Steak tartare was good, not great.  Great craft beer selection and a cool ambience inside the place.....will definitely be coming back if I'm ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I don't see what everyone sees in this place. The staff is so rude and \"stuck up\". They forget who is the paying customer. Food eh. Drinks..if you can find a servers attention. I don't mind a pricey menu... but good service needs to be present."}
{"text":"Let me just start out with this - Greenhouse Tavern is effing AMAZING.  I've heard about this Cleveland culinary powerhouse since it's opening a few years ago but, sadly to say, never checked it out until a few weeks ago.  The planned visit all started when my boyfriend discovered their pig head entree and set himself on feasting on this plate.  So, with that came a Sunday night date night with my one and only and a gigantic head of pig.

The vibe is unique and instantly lovable.  It's very chic and contemporary but has a home-y kind of feel with the natural wood walls and tables - the look is very organic and relaxing.  We started with a beer and wine - great selections btw - and made our order - the chef's tasting menu.  Now beware - this is A LOT of food - so much, in fact, that split between my boyfriend and I we took home about 75% of what we were served (but we're not complaining - the delicious-ness came home with us).  We started with the animal style frites - if you don't try anything else here you need to try these!  Fries with curds, gravy, bacon, two fried eggs, and whole grain mustard - my mouth has never been happier.  The only downside of this was that it was our first \"course\" so we had to force ourselves not to completely indulge since we had 3 more to go - one of which being that damn pig head!

From there we had a version of their Sloppy JO-Nut - again, delicious-ness - which was a stuffed chicken (instead of beef) & BBQ and we had the Crispy Hominy, which was pork skin cracklins, pickled red onion and lime juice (nothing like loading up on pork products before being served the mother of all pork products).  After finishing these two courses we were now left waiting anxiously for the main event.

I'm going to be brief with this part of the meal because I could go on forever about how awesome it was - ORDER THIS PLATE because you will be oh so happy you did.  Everything about it was great - you can make your own pulled pork sandwiches with buns they set on the side, the meat is so tender and the seasoning is mouth watering.  Just know this - these things sell out fast so we were lucky we called to let them know we wanted one because they only had one left that night.  

All in all, I will say Greenhouse counts as one of my favorite dining experiences in Cleveland.  The service was great, the food and drink was excellent, and the overall vibe of the place is incomparable.  I will definitely be a regular of this gem from here on out and will be recommending it to everyone. So with that being said - don't wait any longer and get to Greenhouse Tavern ASAP!"}
{"text":"Most recently came here on a Saturday night to hang out on the rooftop lounge, which is awesome! It's a great space with room to sit and stand. The bartenders are great and they had a great drink special when I was there. 
I have previously eaten here a couple times. Of course, the pig face. It takes a long time to prepare, so if you're SURE you're going to get it, call ahead and put in your order and then show up within the next 30 minutes. You do not want to let it get cold too because it is just amazing when it's just fresh and hot out of the kitchen. Definitely for sharing because the face is a pretty fatty part of the body, I've learned, and although I love me some lard, this is just too much lard for one person. 
I remember having the burger before that was meh, and i think a local fish that was meh. The gravy fries were good, but really all i can remember is the pig face."}
{"text":"The sit down was on time, the staff was excellent and the wine selection was was 

very good.

      There were four of us. 
 
 The food that our wives had was alright but way over salted.

 My friend and I decided on the aged steaks.

   The worst aged beef  that I have ever had. It was a waste of time. Both steaks were

tough and almost uneatable to the point of embarrassment to the owner for serving 

such meat to his patrons.

They say you'll either love or hate the place.
  
Well if the food isn't to par - what can I say I wasn't there for anything else!!!!!!!!


       I 'm sorry to write a review like  this."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a Cavs game and was very happy.  Their wings appetizer was very unique (not anything close to traditional wings).  Very crispy with no bbq sauce, just some garnishes and great flavor.  Drink options were plenty and the server was very helpful with selecting a main course and stopped by frequently.

The atmosphere was laid back, upscale casual and a good change of pace from the other E 4th options."}
{"text":"Had burgers and fries. They were good. Perfectly cooked but really nothing special compared to some other burgers in the Cleveland area. The deserts left a lot to be desired. Kinda reasonable for the price until you get a 7 dollar order of fries which might be a small at McDonald's size wise."}
{"text":"Excellent service and  wonderfully creative & delicious food! We plan on returning to Cleveland just to eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"As frequent visitors to Cleveland's up and coming restaurants, my boyfriend and I stopped into the greenhouse tavern. Within the first moments I loved the decor and atmosphere. Knowing that it was going to be a busy night due to the Cle fireworks, a wait was understandable so we proceeded to sit at the bar to wait for a table. Following a quick delivery after we had ordered we found our feast to be a bit disappointing. A $17 burger should come with whole French fries as they say then we received the end of the pan scraps...

Not only did we have to wait on our own table and take our plates to the bar, but they had the nerve to charge for hot sauce that was mediocre at best. Save your appetite for a different bar and stick to drinks at this disappointing menu."}
{"text":"I had two great meals at The Greenhouse Tavern on a recent trip to Cleveland. The first night, we ate at the chef's table, which was really fun (and mesmerizing). The gnocchi sardi, though oddly named, was a terrific appetizer. For the entree, I really enjoyed the seared walleye, which was accompanied by pleasantly seasoned asparagus and an amazing puree of cauliflower, which had been cooked in coconut milk -- I liked it so much I was wondering if it would be available as a soup (and apparently it is, chilled, on the lunch menu). Our group of four sampled all the desserts, which were delicious and inventive. The second trip, I had the gnocchi sardi again, this time as an entree -- and enjoyed it just as much the first time. The ramp pesto is just so tasty. For the dessert, it was tough to choose -- but I was delighted with the brilliant taste of the creamsicle. Others at the table had the goat cheese semifreddo and pretzel chocolate cake -- also highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Even before post-dinner, early morning food poisoning episode (I'll explain later) I was not at all impressed with this restaurant.  So much hype, so much potential...  completely disappointing.

The waitress was very nice and attentive, though the description of the \"seconds\" dish, Fois Gras Steamed Clams, which she described as a sharing dish, came out with a whopping 6 medium sized clams and 2 small pieces of extremely oily bread.  The taste of the broth was nice, though not much of a sign of fois gras in it, and was almost definitely the culprit causing a full night/morning of vomiting, post-dinner.

The Manhattan I ordered tasted like a college dive bartender mixed it.

My husband had the Pan Fried Pork Chop Saltimbocca, which came out in a messy pile of poorly presented pig fat and potatoes.  Don't get me wrong, I generally LOVE pig fat when done well, but when it's gelatinous and slopped on a plate, you're getting off to a bad start.  

I ordered the Lake Erie Walleye ($28), which was served on an oily, fingerprint marked plate, two small pieces of fish (broken apart and seemingly pushed back together when already plated).  I lived in the San Francisco area for many years and was more than willing to spend $28 on a good piece of fish, but this...  I might have paid $10 if asked what I thought it was worth.  The fish was good, but forgettable.

Other comments from our party were that their meals were not as described.  They were being polite."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say this, but I think I'm done with Greenhouse Tavern.  I was in love with the place during its early days, but the quality of the food has been steadily on the decline over the last year -- most notably when there was a small piece of plastic in my wife's food, an absolute faux pas in any restaurant, much less a certified green one.

Don't get me wrong -- I have so much gratitude for what Chef Sawyer has done for Cleveland and for organic and local food.  But all of the dishes need to rock, and they need to do it consistently.  It can't just be a brilliant bite here and there, depending on which day you go.  I'm tired of talking up GHT to out-of-town visitors, then having them be underwhelmed.

The nail in the coffin was the New Year's Eve 9-course dinner tonight.  Yes, it was competently executed, but it was far too restrained for a holiday dinner, bordering on boring.  Pastry in five out of nine courses -- seriously?

To be fair, the lobster pot pie and main courses were fabulous -- I had the Beef Wellington, and my wife had the Chasseur Plat Du Jour, a fantastic mix of wild birds and game.  But most of the other courses were a mixed bag -- stunning foie gras paired with bland, gray turd-like chestnut gnudi; a salad of amazing, fresh baby herbs overpowered by a too-salty dressing; oysters three ways with a palate-obliterating horseradish vodka shooter.  The sauerkraut cake was a great little bite, but the caviar add-on for $15 was a waste of money -- it added little to the dish.  The desserts were decent but unexciting; again, it was just more pastry after more pastry. Mix it up a bit.

All in all, it was not the memorable dining experience that I had hoped for from a chef and restaurant that have received such glowing national accolades.  There was no dish or flavor that took the meal over the top.  Maybe a restrained, level flavor profile was the intent.  Or perhaps the selections were appropriate based on what local and organic ingredients are available in the middle of winter.  But I suspect that neither is the case.  I think that the culprit was a failure of imagination.  For the money that I dropped, I expect to have my socks knocked off by the entire meal.

A note on service: while the waitstaff is friendly, if a bit quirky, it is absolutely unacceptable that none of them can identify what the food is on the plates.  You can't serve a dish with five relatively exotic meats and not be able to tell the diner which is which.  You can't ask the diner to choose from a dish of various petits fours and not be able to describe what each one is.  I had to request a copy of the menu just to be able to identify what was on my plate.  Unacceptable, especially when you are automatically tacking on a 20% gratuity.

I'll still be rooting for Chef Sawyer on Iron Chef.  And still going to Noodlecat.  But sadly ending my love affair with Greenhouse Tavern for now."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Staff was great and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. However, it just was not the food I was excepting after all the rave reviews. Maybe my diet is too bland but I though the food was too rich. Portions were also very small for the large bill we received at the end of the night. We might try them again in the future, but I'm not dying to go back."}
{"text":"I love the Greenhouse Tavern!  They are always changing their menu and using fresh, local ingredients.  I have never been disappointed.  It can be crowded on show/game nights with everyone eating before the event so it is good to make a reservation.  I would recommend it to any person who would like to eat downtown and go somewhere where the food is not too expensive but is still an incredible dining experience.  This is a Cleveland staple."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to The Greenhouse. I have wanted to order the Pig's Head for two years and finally took the plunge. Not for the faint of heart! The meat on the pig's face is incredibly tender and flavorful. But it is also layered in a massive amount of fatty tissue, and it's a project to get to it all. I'm glad I ordered it. It was certainly a unique and tasty meal. But for me it's a one-time thing. Also note that the Menu in general is fairly limited as to entrees. There are only 6 or 7 main entrees on the menu at any time."}
{"text":"The Roasted Pig's Head might as well be called the \"Early Bird Special\" - with only a limited numer of heads shipped in and two days worth of prep time, the four orders they had available on my visit were gone within half and hour of opening.

Having said that, dining at 9 pm didn't leave much to choose from, so I ended up with the Steak Frites for my entree. The steak was cooked past my requested medium rare, but still tasty for a medium-well and with fantastically crisp and seasoned fries to save the day.

The most poignant flavour profile of the night had to be the Crispy Chicken Wings Confit, which achieved a nice balance of acid, heat, and pungent savouriness with a simple combination of lemon, jalapeno, garlic, and scallions.  Although the meat did \"fall off the bone\", I was hoping for more juiciness in the meat and crispiness to the skin.

The one regret of the night was starting the Chef's Tasting with the Sloppy JO-nut.  Although the idea of a BBQ-filled donut had me licking my lips, the whole dish felt overwhelmed by the monochromatic sweetness of the sauce that covered everything - much more \"cola\" than \"coffee\" is what I tasted.

To close out the evening, I had the buttered popcorn pot de creme.  Seems like everyone is steeping their food in milk these days a la Christina Tosi, including the milk base for this dessert which soaks up the flavour from a good helping of buttered popcorn.  The pairing of caramel and sea salt with the flavour of buttered popcorn was great, although the promise of \"popcorn\" did have me wondering how some sort of crunchy textural contrast could possibly be incorporated into this dessert."}
{"text":"This restaurant made me realize how bland my cooking is. Wow. There was flavor in every dish - even the beef jersey appetizer!!! And who actually likes Brussel sprouts? Well - when you fry them and add whatever magical seasoning dust they use - it was beyond amazing. Love this place and we will go back!!!! We will probably leave the kids at home so we can truly enjoy the meal and ambiance without having to parent. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite things about Greenhouse - well - the chicken wings, the atmosphere, the cocktails. 

-Those chicken wangs fall right off the bone, my friends. RIGHT OFF THE BONE. I'm a garlic nut and there is no lack of whole cloves on those bad boys. Jalapeno. Garlic. 48 hour cooking process. I am in love. 
-The staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable every time I visit. Plus the eco-chic decor makes me giddy. 
-The cocktails are seasonal and delicious, and their wine selection ain't bad either."}
{"text":"We were a little underwhelmed by the Greenhouse Tavern.  I had the foie gras clams (3 small clams) and the fish special which was just a mess.  It's a cool spot with an unusual menu, but it just didn't live up to the hype for us."}
{"text":"Walked to the Green House for lunch from my first day on the job in downtown Cleveland. Completely underwhelmed! It was a hot day so I ordered the Crispy Vegetable Salad $6.50 and added fresh Halibut for $9. What arrived was a very small tangle of greens, a little Chevre that seemed to be melted into the bottom of the plate and a very small piece of watery fish. I'm not a fan of huge portions, but honestly, the portion size was a joke, and both the flavor and execution were a huge miss. So, not including tip $19 for a disappointing little salad and an iced tea. I woudn't go back if the food was free ...  the Green House needs to get over it's not so bad self."}
{"text":"Our party of nine visited the Greenhouse Tavern last Saturday, so I was able to get a good look at multiple menu items. Overall menu items put a unique spin on most dishes, however  as reviewers have mentioned most dishes are quite small and over priced . For instance, the \"Devils on Horseback\" is more artistic than realistic. Consisting of three dates the size of olives, it was more of a Amuse-bouche than an appetizer. Other appetizers were slightly more sizable but were equally over priced,  the Carrots Frites were merely baked carrots with Cumin, Cayenne and a few other spices. Third, the Foie Gras steamed Clams were very tasty, but small. Fourth, the Gnocchi Sardi Pasta was very small but tasty. Of the four appetizers this was the most reasonable portion and best presentation. Unless you merely want to taste food and not quell any level of hunger, I would not rely on any of the dishes on the firsts or seconds menu section. The main course dishes were reasonably sized portions, but for the cost but could have included a higher quality and more interesting side. than french fries. For the main course, several of our group got the Lamb Burger, it was good sized approximately 8 ounces, very well cooked and very flavorful, I tried a bite of my girlfriend's and I would definitely consider the dish if I decided to return. Several others in our group also got the Pork Chops Saltimbocca, they were tender and flavorful, but were on the small side, all but the child in our group complained that they were still hungry. I got the Strip Steak with parsley, shallot mignonette & buerre rouge. Due the high cost of everything of every Entree on the menu $17 and up, I wanted to ensure that I was not setting a dish due to cost. After contemplating the lamb burger and a few other dishes, I got what I wanted the Strip Steak for $28. When the Steak arrived It was cooked as requested and as described was a high quality cut. 

Service on the other hand was quite lacking, our server was quite inattentive and or forgetful. At one point she stood a short distance away and talked for 5-10 minutes. Knowing she would get an automatic gratuity because we were a large party, she did not seem concern regarding the level of service she provided.

The auxiliary staff was quite good and was constantly re-filling my water and promptly clearing the table."}
{"text":"I did it !  I had the pigs head last night and was not disappointed . It was delicious !! The 4 of us ordered appetizers until the pigs head came out and then we all enjoyed it ! The rolls that they give you with it were awesome as well. I highly recommend it if you've been thinking about it . Also had some chicken wings ,carrots, and Brussel sprouts that were delicious as well! Great atmosphere and we had a great waitress Carla as well."}
{"text":"Food was great, really creative menu and fabulous atmosphere. Menu is Especially accommodating for vegetarians and vegans, But we did the 6 course tasting menu and it took over 2 hours. Which put a damper on evening."}
{"text":"Great place.  Great service and very laid back.  They have the best wing app I have ever tasted.  It was a little pricey but will go back again just for the wings.  They also make a wonderful Manhattan."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Greenhouse Tavern I want it to be awesome, unfortunately each time it falls short.  The first time I went, we ordered the fries with a poached egg and gravy - the poached egg was over cooked and had clearly been cooked in a mold.  The pea fritters were tasty enough but the fried taste overwhelmed the pea-ness of the dish.  The waiter was unable to answer questions about where the meat and produce came from; when they pride themselves on local, organic, and sustainable it might behoove them to educate their staff on their food.
The second time I went we split a 4 course meal with tasting portions for quite a decent price, but they did not tell us at the time of ordering that there would be a split plate charge.  I do not mind paying such a charge, but had we known about it at the time of ordering we probably would have ordered separate meals and shared rather than sharing one but paying 1 1/2 times the price.  The food was alright except for the pasta dish featuring morels and fiddleheads had those main ingredients chopped into unrecognizable bits, making it unable to appreciate them.  
The third and fourth times I went we sat at the bar, which seems to be what you need to do to get more than lackadaisical service.  The food sent out to us was ok, however we got cracked clams, semi-cold fries, and another unmemorable dish.  The drinks were delightful, though, and I would go back for just that, but I might wait for the next menu change to give the food another try."}
{"text":"By far the most disappointing meal I have ever eaten. By the prices I was expecting a good quality meal. A group of us went for my friend's birthday dinner- the service was nearly non existent. I was never given a glass of water and had to remain content with my cocktail. Employees continued to sprint up and down the staircase which was in the middle of the dining room, which was kind of distracting and unpleasant while we were trying to have dinner. Some of my party ordered the tasting menu and courses were served to them while dishes from their previous courses piled up on our table. My friend and I ordered the Foie Gras Steamed Clams and the Fred Flintstone Beef Short Rib and explained that we would like them to split the clams on two dishes which our server said would be no problem, however, this was ignored when they finally brought it out- the sauce was wonderful on the clams and I was ready to disregard the inappropriate behavior of the employees until I tried the clams which were over cooked and had obviously been sitting in the window for quite some time before our server brought them out. The Short Rib presentation was incredible- extremely large and looked magnificent- however when we began to eat we both realized that the beef had not been trimmed AT ALL. Half of our meal remained on the platter (which I noticed some of the enamel peeling off- into our gravy no less!) at the end of dinner. Had it not been my friends birthday I would have made it a point to find someone to make a complaint to. This may have been a difficult task because at no point did a manager come by afterwards to see how anything was. It got worse I went downstairs to the restroom after dinner because I felt sick, at this point I wasn't surprised by the lack of cleanliness of the kitchen. I was sick the remainder of the night and the next day. The food was not good at all and the entire experience was terrible. I'm amazed this place remains in business."}
{"text":"Wow what a place.  I read the reviews listed here and I am shocked at some of the negative opinions.  I have been her many times and always a great experience.  Great food, cool space, and the whole Green Thing is an added bonus that completes the experience.  I have lived in NYC and Chicago and this place ranks with some of the best they have to offer.  When you consider the prices compared to other big city restaurants this place is a bargain.  I realize, I am not in those cities anymore, but please even in Cleveland this place is not that pricey for the value, quality and downright great food you get.  I recommend the tasting menu at $44 per person you will eat a huge meal that offers lots of diverse tastes.  Don't listen to the naysayers this place rocks!!

Had the Bacon wrapped dates, gravy fries and the best pork chop I have ever eaten.  Took half home the next day, tasted great then too."}
{"text":"Very good food. Pig's head was delicious! Reasonably priced dishes and great atmosphere. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Okay before you continue reading I DID NOT TRY THE FOOD.  I wanted to go to try the food but we went more for after dinner drinks on the amazing roof top bar.  This review will definitely be updated when I try the food.  The roof top bar was pleasent.  We went on the first night that it opened and it was bussling.  The atmosphere of the entire establishment is amazing.  The bottom floor was covered in VHS movies which was a blast from the past.  The second floor was a dining area and lastly the top floor had the roof top bar.  I started with a long island and it was TERRIBLE!!  I could actually taste fizzles in the tea and it was not very good.  The second drink (a friend ordered cannot remember the name) was much better.  It was late in the evening and the roof top was out of beer and a little unprepared for the crowd they would get considering it was so nice outside.  Needless to say,  I would stick to beer or hope you have a good bartender and I will most definitely be going back to try the pig head or beef ribs."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that chef Sawyer's team makes amazing food, but the best thing about Greenhouse is the service."}
{"text":"while reading the yelp reviews for greenhouse tavern, one word kept popping up: Salty. sad to say, i agree with those reviewers who found their food on the salty side. i understand that salt brings out the flavor in food but it's truly an art to know when enough is enough. to be fair, i can see how greenhouse tavern's food can be truly great - the first 2 bites of my fresh pasta proves that but then the salt hits and it was painful to finish it because all i tasted in the end was the saltiness of the dish. my friend's frites seasoned with rosemary was really good but the more you eat it, the saltier it gets. i can't tell you how many times our server had to refill my water but i know it was a LOT. 

i really wanted to like your food but alas, you and i are not meant to be so good luck to you, greenhouse tavern. i wish you well but i don't think i will be back."}
{"text":"I'm prefacing this review by saying we had 12 in our party the night we went to celebrate a birthday. 

We made reservations well in advance, the table was ready basically on time, and they were able to sit us all together when they first said they would have to split us up. Once seated our drinks came out fairly quickly which set the tone for our expectations. Our server seemed to embody the feel and had the right fit for the atmosphere. However, once we got our drinks we waited a bit to place our order and everything went down hill from there. Once our order was placed we waited close to an hour for our food. Many individuals' (3/12) orders were not correct. Many ordered beef burgers and the buns were completely soggy by the time they came to the table. For an $18 burger you would expect better than that. To top it off once the server knew it was a birthday celebration someone (a different server) brought out ice cream with a candle. When we got our checks (which took us requesting them and an additional 30 minutes to get) the ice cream was charged to one of the checks. We did not ask for this and were not told it would cost anything. Very inconsiderate! Finally the checks were taken with our payment and left unattended at the end of bar where anyone could have picked them up and walked out. 

Overall it is a very good looking restaurant that lacks in substance."}
{"text":"Wow.  What I thought was going to be a great night turned out very disappointing.

Strictly due to the service we received by our waiter \"Steven\", we will not be returning to the Greenhouse.

Our birthday party had a group (14) reservation for 7pm.  We weren't seated until 7:30pm, even though we arrived early and the hostess said they hold the tables open for 30 minutes before seating time for group dinners.

Then, Steven arrived.   And his attitude arrived with him.  Not friendly. Not accommodating. Not a pleasure to be around.  Simple questions (like \" can I order a drink?\") were met with snarky comments.

Our dinner order was finally taken about 1 hour after we arrived.

Then the best part.......Steven decided to respond to one of our guest's comments about the timeline for drinks/dinner with \"fuck off\".  Yes, Steven told one of his diners to \"fuck off\".  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  Management was called and all they did was comp that person's drink order.  Steven should  have been removed as our server, period.  He made his comment in front of another server, so there was no question as to if he said it.

The food arrived and was quite good, although one of the orders was under-cooked and took 20 minutes to re-plate.

Then the checks came and, understandably, a gratuity was added to each bill due to the size of the party.  However, they added a whopping 25% gratuity!!  Not 20%.  Not 18%, which, IMO, is quite customary.  When making the reservations, the restaurant told us there was a mandatory gratuity, but did not say it was 25%.

Oh we had a pre-fix menu, so didn't even have access to the full menu for dinner.

Thus, we had to tip Steven out over $250 after he told our guests to \"fuck off\", and having a reduced menu for dinner.

I spoke with the manager on the way out, who did nothing but reiterate that they comp'd our guest's drink order and that the mandatory gratuity was policy.

Management should have:
1. Removed Steven as our server, immediately after he swore at our guests.
2. Reduced the mandatory gratuity to, at least, something that was in line with the industry and, especially, in line with the type of poor service we received.

Unfortunately, none in our group will be returning to an otherwise interesting restaurant due to the unacceptable behavior by service and management."}
{"text":"Food was fine (I had the wings). Service was awful. I sat at the bar and was basically ignored by waitstaff who were happy to talk up a variety of other customers. Only in town for the day, so not my problem, but please work on your customer service."}
{"text":"1st vsit. Looking forward to many, many, many more. Portions were great and opted to eat at bar. Bar staff was by far the best around, knowledgeable of beverages and menu alike. Good food and great atomphsere. Had the lamb burger at medium and it was AWESOME. So, stop reading this review and get inside and enjoy yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was pleasant, however the most recent experience has discouraged me from ever returning. First, we had a reservation for a party of 7 yet were crammed upstairs next to other large parties. I couldn't even back my chair out without hitting the people behind us. Second, there was little to no airflow. Our entire party spent the evening overly warm with only an occasional breeze from the single fan that was supposed to cool the entire area. Third, we ordered the ribs in advance so they'd be ready in time. When they arrived, one was completely fat. We complained and they \"rushed\" the order to get it replaced. By then, everyone else was done eating so we just had them pack it to go. Even after we got home, one of the ribs was still complete fat. If we do go back, I WILL NOT be ordering the ribs again and will request to sit anywhere but that 2nd level."}
{"text":"Pork is everywhere here - in fat form as an accompaniment to the bread basket, on the waiters' t-shirts, and definitely influencing the menu.  We liked the four for $44 prix fixe menu, and this didn't mean four small plates, either!  Yowza!  Great wine list, too, and when they were out of the cheapest Cab, they substituted a much pricier Bordeaux.  Nice.  Eclectic decor too and nice that there's a second floor overlooking downtown's most fun street, East Fourth!  Our waiter, Kevin, was superior in every way."}
{"text":"I visited Greenhouse Tavern for the first time last night for dinner.  I have had drinks here quite a few times, and they have a nice rooftop patio, but dinner was even better.

Drinks: I had a great drink that was a twist on a French 75.  It was made with cucumber.  It was sweet but not too sweet.  My bf had the rooftop cooler, which he loved.  I am not a fan of ginger beer (their use of ginger beer is actually one of the only things I don't like about this place.  I always order crown and ginger and then remember I don't like ginger beer too late!)

Meal: I had the beef burger.  It was cooked correctly, the toppings were good, pickle was yummy, and the fries were hot and deliciously herby.

My boyfriend had devils on horseback and the Fred Flinstone.  Well, half of it, because it is way too much for one average sized person to finish!  It was an impressive dish.  Though I didn't try it, he thought it was great.

Service: Our server was named Adam, if I remember right.  He was friendly and helpful.  He brought us a taste of scotch that he recommended and an extra devils on horseback!  I think he probably was trying to compensate for the fact that he knew the Fred Flinstone takes a long time to prepare, but we really didn't mind.  He warned us ahead of time that it takes a while.

Atmosphere: We sat in the front window area.  We were the only people in there until close to when we were leaving.  If there were more people in there it may have been cramped but it was nice and quiet while we were there.  The outside patio was on a wait so you may need a reservation if you want to sit out there.

I will be back to eat again I am sure."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Loved the food even better! The jalapeno wings are a great appetizer. And the pomme frites (aka fries) with rosemary and a fried egg are DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. I know it's not a fine dining restaurant but I was expecting a pretty nice meal. We were pretty disappointed starting with the poor service. It took forever to get our drinks. The mixed drinks were not very creative especially compared to a place like Los Albotros. Then it took forever for the waitress to come back and take our dinner order. It wasn't too crowded either. She just seemed unenthusiastic. I got the house salad which was a plate of spinach leaves with a dressing that tasted like soy sauce. A few tiny crumbles of blue cheese also. I got the fish for dinner. I think $27 dollars for a piece of walleye is pretty pricey. Especially since it was served with only a few fava beans and rhubarb that seemed like they were prepped earlier in the day. The fish wasn't that tasty either. It tasted gelatinous in parts. I was hungry after my meal. They could have done some rice or something with it. My husbands pork was okay but small. Maybe we would have been better off sticking to the richer foods like the wings or fried chicken? I left feeling uninspired and hungry. It was definitely not James Beard award winner good. I really hope they can step up there game here. We had to go out for dessert after dinner because we were still hungry. Not the anniversary dinner I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Went here the a few times.  Food is absolutely delicious, but overpriced.  Chicken wings were some of the best I've ever had.  Definitely a great place to go if you're looking for gourmet flavor and are willing to pay for it.

Got a bourbon on the rocks and was upcharged for ice at the end, which left me feeling a bit bitter about the place unfortunately."}
{"text":"Seriously so insanely disappointed! Came with a small group for dinner - waited quite literally 20 minutes before we were even acknowledged by a server. 
We were seated outside - DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE! We were under siege! Bird poop bombs after bird poop bombs exploded all over our table - and in the guest of honor's hair! 
Our waiter was not very helpful - slapping down some napkins and running away while saying \"Yup.. that happens a lot.\" Granted, what else could he do? He was too busy ignoring us to find us another table or offer any other apologies. We also couldn't really talk while seated outside, thanks to the extremely raucous atmosphere of E. 4th. (not to mention the random homeless man who wandered up and took a seat at an occupied table -- the waitress who shoo-ed him made a bit of a scene and we thought it was a bit rude).   
We were not informed about how tiny the plates are - you really need to have at LEAST three courses to be full. 
I inspected the menu thoroughly before arriving, so I knew that there were vegan options for me. The menu online was not kept up to date, and my server didn't seem too keen on telling me what on the menu was safe to eat. 
I ordered a pasta dish that I consumed in literally 4 small bites. I can't even tell you what it tasted like - it was overly salty and tasted of nothing else. I was going to at least order another glass of wine, but we never saw our waiter until he brought us our checks (which he grumbled about, as we [very nicely] asked to split the guest of honor's check between us). 

Insanely over priced, underwhelming food and really sub par service. I really wanted to like this place!"}
{"text":"I love the decor of the restaurant. Seating was a bit close to surrounding tables.  Service was wonderful. 

We had dinner for two people - we got the cauliflower salad,  market fish (halibut), and steak. 
Cauliflower salad was great. Halibut was very overcooked. Steak was also pretty rough and chewy, which I suspect was more due to the aging process (or lack of), rather than how it was cooked. 
I didn't have cocktails tonight - I had them before and they have great cocktails here. 

Won't come here for food again.  Maybe drinks."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, service is always good, food excellent. 

My advice is get the four course tasting menu and ask your server to pick their favorites. That way you get to try things you might not otherwise."}
{"text":"Our first visit did not live up to expectations. Skip the Chicken Wings Confit and Animal Style Frites. They are extremely overrated. Get an exciting and inventive salad instead. The Heirloom Tomato Salad and Deep Fried Watermelon Salad were sooooo gooood! 

I'm going to give the place one more shot and order the roasted pig's head, and short ribs (and bring four of five people to help me). I'll update the review when I make that trip. But honestly I don't think it'll be any time soon. 

I do have to pay complements to the staff. They were very gracious and got us seated quickly even though we arrived earlier than scheduled on a busy Friday night. And our waiter was very fun and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Soooo Cleveland. How so? First, look at the back of the menu. A who's who of grant whoring eco-NEO-locavore-NEO-trend-chasing-NEO-non-profit-NEO poserdom.  Why Joe Cimperman, Green City Blue Lake, other assorted \"green\" glitterati are listed there, or anywhere, in any restaurant, is a mystery. If you have to boot strap your cred on this crowd, on your own fucking menu, you aren't a business, you're a prop.

Next, look up. Yes, that's a styrofoam drop ceiling. They reeeeally want you to look up (hanging bikes! we're cool! hip even!), but whatever this century old industrial sized space has on the other side of that cubicle farm office decor surely must be better. 

Then, the prices, which the back of the menu calls \"approachable\", which I guess means approaching confiscatory. Once more, a CLE restaurant rapes its community, this time charging $54 for a pig's head...no wait...half a pig's head. Don't these heads get tossed anyway? The meat of it was excellent, but washing it down with your bank account is so not worth it. You cannot get out of here spending less than $70. A $15 steak simply must be $35. Do not ask why, philistine. 

As an Italian, I measure a place by its pasta.  If you fuck up a pasta, you don't know what the fuck you are doing.  So I ordered a $24 pasta - not a typo - just to see how salted, over spiced, sticky, and weird they could make it. Was not disappointed.

There is no level of pretentious wildly over priced silliness so pointless that CLE will not embrace it, sing its praises, dance around it in celebration. I have no idea how this place survives, other than as some foundation's tax shelter."}
{"text":"Great food! Wonderfully small and manageable portions reminded of eating in Europe! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for a long time, the opportunity to do so only recently presented itself when entertaining out of town business partners. I love when I get to show off Cleveland, how much it has changed and grown, and going to E 4th is a no-brainer (yes, fully aware there are hipper places to go). 

Our server was fantastic, zero complaints about the service. He was knowledgeable about the cocktails, the beer choices and the menu. We ordered several small plates- the Jerky was meh, very sweet, a couple of the thinner pieces reminded me of a bad, meat fruit rollup. The fried cheese poofs were great, I don't normally like pimento cheese. Pass on the pork and peppers, they are simply way overpriced fried pork rinds. 

I may have made a mistake in ordering their steak, assuming it would be far better than a steak I would make at home. Especially because, as the menu proudly states, it is \"ohio's only certified angus beef.\" (Fun fact, over 85% of the meat you eat is Angus. There is zero difference between certified and non-certified angus beef other than the needless markup.)
The steak itself was only ok. It was cooked just fine, had a nice char to it and was the right amount of pink and temperature for medium. I found it to be lacking in any flavor whatsoever, sorely disappointed.

I would, however, highly recommend their animal fries. A really good take on poutine. 

I'd try it again, but will wait until the menu changes as well as not getting the steak."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for our anniversary and decided to try several different restaurants (apps and drinks). Several other places had said that we HAD to go to GHT and to have the wings. Wow, what a disappointment! They were completely covered in green onions. Even though they were tender, they were also very salty & spicy. I finished with a dessert that was like a creme brulee with a caramel popcorn topping. It was pretty good. I was hoping to stick around to see the pig's head that was one table over, but since they evidently take 1 hr & 15 min to make we didn't want to wait there since they were crowded. The decor is okay, but the place just did nothing to wow either of us."}
{"text":"Terrible. Went with a group for a work dinner. Service was poor. Food was mediocre. Waitress spilled ++ red wine on the suit and dress shirt of someone in our group. Not coming back. Many better places in town"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying I was very impressed with the beer list.  I was happy to see Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Monster Ale and 21st Amendment Black IPA on the list.

Moving to the food, I started with a Market Green Salad.  A truly refreshing light salad w/ cider dijon vinaigrette, pickled red onion & local goat cheese.  It was zestful yet to the point.

I ordered the Dhaal Lentil Veggie Burger for my main course, but they were out of it, so I had a tofu dish with mixed vegetables.  It was good, but nothing to get overly excited about.  It had quality fresh veggies, but it was a little bit skimpy.  I have to keep in mind I am in Cleveland and not California anymore. Here it is challenging for local chefs to find local organic sustainable produce.  Therefore, good veggies are not plentiful.

I sat at the bar and the service provided by the bartender was fine.  I love the ambiance of this place.  It is very modern, but comfortable.

Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Went downtown with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We chose the Greenhouse Tavern for dinner based on their vegetarian/vegan options and good reviews. I had the Acorn Squash Confit and it was completely flavorless. Very disappointing, especially for $24. The Pomme Frites had more garlic with the hull and rosemary than fries. The veggie burger was just okay. When we asked how the appetizer of Fish Quenelles could be made vegan (as the menu noted), the server said it was not vegan but vegetarian. Fish is not a vegetarian item. If you're going to advertise that you're vegan/vegetarian friendly, at least offer a few satisfying dishes and educate your staff on the meaning. We were very let down by the whole experience and unfortunately are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here before the Cavs game Friday night and this was our 2nd time to the restaurant. Yet again, we left very unsatisfied and a lot lighter in our wallet.  One of the most, if not the most overrated restaurants in the Cleveland area, living off its name recognition.  Our server was very slow and rude, she appeared like she didn't care that she was working, several times blowing past our table when I was trying to get her attention.  The food was extremely disappointing, everything was way over salted, and it is not very fun when you have to pick out lemon seeds and garlic peel from your food while you are eating.  We would never go back here again, and I would advise others to do the same.  There are plenty of over excellent restaurants in the Cleveland area to go and actually enjoy your dining experience.  Chef Sawyer should be embarrassed at what this restaurant has become."}
{"text":"I only had a couple of canned beers so I can't comment on the food.  However, even on a Monday evening it had a nice vibe and the wait staff seemed friendly enough."}
{"text":"Absolutely do not eat here. Had the pork and got violently ill about an hour after. Tasted ok but worst food poisoning ever. I will never go back - and advise everyone to stay away. Far away."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what more I can say that other's haven't. I will tell you that when I entertain guests from outside Cleveland, Greenhouse is a mandatory part of my tour. From the creative seasonal menus to the warm midwest customer service, Greenhouse is what makes Cleveland...Cleveland."}
{"text":"One of the best pork dishes I've ever had.  Very flavorful and multiple textures. The salmon poke appetizer was uniquely presented and fresh.  You pay more for how well the food is sourced and prepared, but I could certainly taste the difference."}
{"text":"After many glowing reviews both on Yelp and from friends we decided to brave the Saturday night Indians and casino crowds and try the Greenhouse.  We called and were told all tables were booked but the bar area tables are first-come.  When we arrived we got a drink and a nice couple told us they were leaving their table and that it was self seating.  So...we sat down after they left.  Then we were told that \"that night\" those tables were reservation only.  I had heard the host try to seat a couple of women waiting at the bar outside because they were overbooked so I know they were just giving us a line to save a table.  We decided to finish our drinks and go somewhere else that had better control of their operation.  Then we were told we could have the table...and unfortunately we decided to stay.  

We both went with the tasting menu which gives you one choice from each course so we could experience all the culinary delights we read and heard about.  

First course:  I got deep fried pobrano peppers which were OK, but I tasted way too much vinegar in them.  My fiance got froi gras mussels which were fine but bland- not at all what we expected based on the recommendations. 

Second course:  I chose the famous crispy confit wings which were unanimously rated very high.  The portion was great and the meat fell off the bone, but they were completely buried by chopped shallots and green onions.  The richness of the meat was overpowered by the overuse of lemon.  My fiance chose the beef tartar which was excellent- best thing we ate all night.

Third (main) course:  I chose the pork chop saltimboca.  It's a rib-eye cut of pork chop so they actually take the center portion and do that saltimboca style (prosciutto covered) and it was outrageously salty.  The outer strip was charred and looked like it would be the equivalent of succulent pork belly...but it was utterly flavorless.  It comes with a bit of scrapple which was the best thing on my plate.  My fiance got the fried air cheese which was basically a plank of fried mozzarella in some marinara.  It was just ok, but nothing special.

Fourth:  Fourth is normally desert but we were able to get sides with our entrees instead.  I chose the spicy greens n beans which turned out to be an asian peanut sauce over wilted romaine lettuce.  One bite and I was done with it.  My fiance got basically gravy covered french fries...which would be impossible to not execute well.

In summary, we didn't get much that I would call terrible, but we didn't get anything that really impressed us.  IN their defense they had a large private party on the roof deck so that may have impacted their quality, but we also didn't see much to impress.  I don't write to bash the place, which is why I listed what we ate- perhaps we chose poorly.  We are admitted food snobs and difficult to impress so take this review for what it is, just a review of our opinions."}
{"text":"Did you know I was contacted by the owner about my review 2 years ago? Did you know it took me a while to get back (a week or so) and by the time i returned his message, first by calling the restaurant, and then by leaving him a message on here with my phone number, I never heard back.  I suspect the lack of response was because he was probably told by that point that Bon Appetite magazine had named his place one of the best new restaurants of 2009, and that enough did't warrant a response to little old yelp reviewer, or maybe he just doesn't check his inbox anymore? Or maybe it doesn't matter anymore. 

So anyways, i've been back a few times (after an over 1 year hiatus to let my head cool, and their service improve), and I've been both surprised (good and bad) and pleased. 

The good: The rooftop patio view and menu (no food is a plus in all honesty, keep the campers away), the late night happy hour menu and the atmosphere. 

The OK: Prices of food are usually reasonable for what it is, sticking with the first seconds and halves still holds true as your best bets. the entree's are usually not worth the price. 

The nitpicking: Inconsistant service. I've had fantastic bartenders on the rooftop, really laid back and more then happy to chat, but there is this one bartender at the main bar who must feel threatened by me or something because I got this vibe and response from him that he had to exert an aura of superiority towards me. It's really strange and sort of funny, but he made a stiff drink and left us alone, so I was ok. 

Overall, greenhouse has become a good late night place for food, and a decent beer menu to boot."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. The chicken wings were wonderful. I like that they were not served with sauce. The fries were the best I have ever had. Whole garlic and rosemary sprigs. The staff are helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"We frequent The Greenhouse Tavern quite regularly, so we decided to purchase a $100 gift card for a family member for Christmas. We waited 2 weeks for the card to arrive, and when it didn't, we reached out to the General Manager, who promised to send another replacement card. Never got that one either. However, this restaurant didn't waste anytime charging our credit card. So we have paid $100 for absolutely nothing and it has been over a month now. The manager has stopped responding to us and we are getting no satisfaction whatsoever. Maybe $100 is nothing to The Greenhouse Tavern, but we'd like to get what we paid for. How is this an acceptable way to treat customers?"}
{"text":"Not impressed by our meal tonight. I felt the menu was overly ambitious. Prices are way too high for the quality of the food. The roasted eggplant was burnt, as was the inedible bread that accompanied it. I inquired with the waitress and she told me \"that's how it always is...\" Gross. The eggplant was also $1 more on the bill than on the menu - I didn't argue the point in the restaurant, but a cheap shot, nonetheless. The bucatini was undercooked - beyond al dente - and bland. The brussel sprouts were average for $11. 

Long story short - the food and service should be much better at this price level."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for the first time so keep in mind this review is only based on one experience. 

Hostess was kind and attentive. We were willing to wait the 45 minutes, especially on the rooftop bar! 

Our server Russ was fabulous. He was happy to serve us and I really appreciated that about him. Smiles go a long way. (We even witnessed a homeless man run up and steal a cash tab off of a table that ended up being his and Russ was still joyful and happy considering the unfortunate loss!) 

We started with asparagus and brussel sprouts, which we absolutely devoured shamelessly. 

I ordered the pork belly for dinner, first time ever trying it in my life! The smell of the cumin flooded my nose when it was placed in front of me, which made me fall in love right away. Belly ended up being tender and flavorful in all the right ways. Compliments to the chef. 

My sister and friend both ordered the carbonara. I thought it was a boring choice considering the menu offered so many other wonderful creations but they both loved it. Not a single noodle left behind! 

Decor, food, ambience, and service were all on point in my book. Can't wait to come back and try something new next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Other than the novelty of eating pig head or the Flintstone ribs, don't waste your time. Don't order the cheese sampler appetizer. A skimpy waste of money. Service staff was very good, prompt, know the menu well, and well versed in table protocol.  Dinnerware that was removed with each course was promptly replaced. I am diabetic and asked for a diet coke. Sorry no coke or Pepsi products.  The only sugar free beverage? Iced tea or water.  OK just give me a Miller Lite.  Sorry no light beers. Gluten free guests no problem.  Diabetic? Oh well...  Other than the pig head and beef ribs. The food is forgettable.  Too many other downtown places to enjoy.  I won't be back and won't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! When you walk in there are vintage bicycles hanging from the ceiling and retro VHSs playing above the bar. You then have to make a choice from the endless list of beers, wines, and teas! The menu is spectacular. Everything on it looked so good that I had to ask the server to surprise me! The Lamb Burger was a perfect medium rare, the chips were perfectly thin and crisp, and the brisket was beautifully moist! The only reason I give this joint 4 and not 5 stars is because the service was extremely slow. Overall though this place is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Everyone in my party chose to take advantage of the tasting menu. The tasting menu allows you to pick a 1st course, a second course, a main course and either a side or dessert. You get all of this for only $39! Yes, it can seem a bit pricey for one person, but look at just how many different dishes you get to try! And when you go with a big group it's even more fun- as long as your crowd is OK with sharing  ;)

For my first course, I chose the breakfast radishes, which were served cold with butter, lemon zest & sea salt. These were so refreshing! Incredibly crispy. The heat of the radish was balanced out nicely by the smooth, creamy butter and salt.

My next dish was grilled artichokes and sauteed mushrooms. I'm not sure what sauce or seasonings were used, but they were incredible! I had a hard time sharing this dish with outhers.

My main dish was... interesting. I had absolutely no idea what to expect. The dish was called Puttanesca. Puttanesca is a type of sauce made with tomatoes, capers and OLIVES. Call me insane, but I HATE olives. Of course that would have been nice to know before I ordered the dish. To be fair, I did not ask if the dish had olives in it. And at this point I should probably mention the amazingness that is The Greenhouse Tavern staff. They were all so incredibly helpful and also brought over a few complimentary dishes to make sure our table got the full tasting experience. Anyway, back to my Puttanesca. Aside from the fact that olives make me want to heave, I enjoyed this dish as much as I could. The roasted tomatoes were cooked perfectly and created sweet explosions with every bite. Those few bites alone made the dish worth it. Best dish I tried (and sadly don't have a photo of): Half Roasted Chicken in Brioche Bread.

Oh dear. There are no words. I will be going back to order this dish for myself. And there will be no sharing, I assure you.

Instead of ordering dessert (the horror!) I ordered beluga lentils. Best decision I made. Why? Because these were addictingly succulent. Well, and everyone else was pretty much full by this point, so I had most of their dessert.

One of the things I loved so much about this meal was the fact that I WAS NOT uncomfortably full afterwards! How nice to enjoy so many different dishes and not feel sick! I chalk this up to The Greenhouse's perfect portions - just right for tasting and enjoying, without over doing it.

This was an incredible meal, enjoyed with my beautiful family set to a soundtrack of laughter and great conversation. I really can't think of a better way to spend an evening."}
{"text":"its sucks to admidt I got such bad service for such a good meal. I sat at the bar by myself and probably waited a good 10-15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged I had sat down. I was almost to the point of getting up and leaving, but I am glad I didnt because the food was so good. I ordered the Beef tartar and the Fois and Clams. I dont really remember the tartar because it is blocked out by how good the fois and clams were. It was the richest most delicious broth ever with several pieces of thick crusty bread to soak it up. As pissed off as I was at the service the food made me leave happy. (a couple of blatz beers, only $1.86, also helped curb the anger, greatest drink deal ever) Hopefully the next time I go back I get better service, because I really wanted to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from Chicago and stopped in on a Friday night for dinner and then back on Saturday for cocktails and dessert.  Excellent service, everything was delicious and a fantastic cocktail menu."}
{"text":"The waitress explained the four course chef tasting for $37. 

First course: Chopped Chicken Livers. 

I was expecting the iron, mineral-ly taste I've associated with chicken livers. What I got was something much closer to foie gras. It was creamy and buttery, and had the consistency of pâté that had been ground, not just chopped. Overall very good. 

Second course: Goat Cheese Tart. 

I was prepared for a filo or puff pastry beggar's purse filled with goat cheese. Instead of the dough, the cheese and caramelized onion was nestled into a bowl fashioned from potato chips. Not nearly enough cheese or onion, but not horrible for the second appetizer. The fresh locally grown tomatoes where the best thing on the plate. 

Main course: Steak Frites. 

The description of the dish left me wondering - do they fry the steak? Turns out it was just a lump of local beef, with a bit of herb butter slathered on. What makes it 'frites' was the pommes frites served with it. My least favorite dish of the night. Guess I should have inquired more from our server. 

Dessert course: Jeni & Keri. 

Jeni's ice cream - a beet, lemon, and poppy seed delight. I was fearing that they would mask the flavors with too much sugar. They did not. 

Keri's cookies - two amaretto cookies and a madeleine. Crispy outside, chewy inside. Absolutely perfect. 

Libations - wines and liquors from all over the world. Not many local options. One of the few local drinks was a delightful IPA from Stongsville, OH. I was disappointed in the list. 

The Rub: 

My bill, without my drink, was $40, though I got the chef tasting special. Never one to haggle over $3, I paid without saying a word. I'm sure I could have had the mistake corrected right away, but that isn't the point. It does not reflect well on the server or the restaurant when they explain a special, then fail to deliver. An honest mistake, I'm sure. But a mistake nonetheless."}
{"text":"The menu hooked me into making a reservation here, it seems these guys are pig-worshippers like me and they exploited many opportunities to insert porkishness into the menu.  Kudos for using the incredible opportunity of having Victory Brewing make your restaurant a custom brew to make a lager!  I'm so sick of IPAs and IPAs disguised under a kooky name.  One true test of a brewery is to make a complex flavorful beer in a style which is extremely unforgiving.  It was delicious.  The bread came with a macerated paste of pork meat and perhaps pork fat, another auspicious sign.  Appetizer: Grilled Octopus and Pig Tongue Dolma.  The Grilled Octopus was better, the diced salumi in it did not obscure the wonderful texture and briny goodness of the octopus, and added a little gloss and richness.  

For my entree, I could not resist the whole roasted pig's head (well half a head but by whole I mean \"in tacto\").  This was my only beef (lol), they smothered it in barbecue sauce.  The sauce was burnt, simple, and overly sweet, and only got in the way of the delicious variety of flesh offered by the head.  It seemed like an apology for serving an animal's head as food.  Don't apologize for the pig, Greenhouse Tavern, dignify it's sacrifice by roasting the skin to a beautiful, crispy, golden caramel, so I can look in it's eye and thank it when it comes to the table.  Use your obvious creative talents to come up with a piquant, spicy sauce served on the side (i mean, how do you sauce half a head anyway?).  And come up with a better side than a quick vegetable pickle and a supermarket hamburger bun, the pig deserves it.

The wine and beer menu have a lot of interesting selections, but the one tap is the GT Victory beer and really is the most obvious choice as you can only get it here.  The malbec by-the-glass was middling according to my Argentine wife, but the syrah-grenache Cotes du Rhone was quite good.

They have a nice scotch menu, which eschews more well-known (and often disappointing) Speyside labels and offers an opportunity to discover something really tasty, such as the Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban, a 12-yr which punches well above it's weight.  Finding scotches you like can be extremely expensive but I got lucky this time and wish I could roll the dice again with their selections.  

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"For being labeled, \"Green house,\" their vegetarian options are hardly delectable. A lot of the people like the meat. I ordered their veggie burger and I really didn't finish it. Not the best veggie burger. Maybe somewhere else if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was subpar.  We ordered a few appetizers and two dinners and it took over 45 minutes to get our food.  When we asked about it, the server argued and said they were backed up.  For 8:30 at night, I consider 45 minutes to be a bit long."}
{"text":"Did not like the food at all here. We got the lamb burger, and asked it to be medium rare - when the burger came in - it was almost overcooked, and was drenched in butter. It was just the lamb patty and bread.

A co-worker of mine said this is the second time he came here, and this is the second time he feels disappointment. Not going again..."}
{"text":"Nice attentive staff, inventive food, cool atmosphere. lives up to the hype! i only wish their menu was a little bigger, but I've noticed that most places that source heavily local as greenhouse does, they tend to have a more limited selection."}
{"text":"We heard a lot of good things about this place, but we were totally disappointed with the brunch and service.  The French Press coffee is great, but we didn't know it was French pressed, so we were frustrated with the 20 minute wait. The waffles showed up at our table cold, without plates or syrup.  Our poached eggs with the Benedict were literally not cooked. It was like a raw egg was cracked on top. The waitress tried to explain what poached eggs are to me. I assured her that I eat poached eggs all of the time and I know how they are cooked. They did comp our breakfast, but we would have rather paid for a good meal."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because I'd heard many good things about it. I went there for lunch with my boss and two co-workers. If it's up to me, I will never go back.

I ordered the Big Caesar salad, and as a big fan of Caesar salads, I was looking forward to trying theirs. They grill the lettuce, but rather than doing it right, they char and burn the lettuce in such a way that results in wilting and leaving an after-taste as though I just finished a cigarette. Additionally, the dressing is very light to the point that if I didn't know what I had ordered, I wouldn't have recognized the dressing as Caesar at all! I pretty much dreaded every bite. The one exception was the croutons, which were pretty awesome. 

Our service was also pretty mediocre. We were seated outside, and while our drink order was taken right away, it took forever for anyone to come back. And even longer for someone to check on us--our waitress didn't return until we were long done. 

Overall, a very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"The food ranged from jaw-droppingly amazing to pretty good. My husband and I both had the chef's tasting menu, which is cleverly designed to maximum accessibility. I had the sauerkraut and potato pancake with smoked fish and creme freche, which was incredible, followed by the chicken wings comfit, which were delicious but very salty. My husband began his meal with the \"Devils on Horseback\" -- stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates, and then had a wonderful beef tartar, which was presented in a gorgeous manner. His steak was pretty good, and my lamb burger was a little weird. It had a slightly gamy cheese and came with a curry yogurt sauce, neither of which I enjoyed. We shared the grilled Caesar salad, which I felt was the best thing of the night. We finished up with the buttered popcorn pot a creme. It was wonderful, but I was stuffed, so my husband managed to eat most of it. The service was terrific, really stellar. I heartily recommend the restaurant, but might suggest you avoid the lamb burger."}
{"text":"Great waitstaff that gave helpful options to the city.  Interesting decor that has old VHS tapes in shelves. The menu had a lot of grease choices, however stuck the burger- very tasty! Enjoy the patio 
and order a Luke's cider and do some people watching at this gastropub."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime fan of The Greenhouse Tavern, but my experiences there lately have been less than stellar and I will not be recommending it anymore. It has always been at the pricier end of the spectrum, but that never bothered me since the quality of food and service was superb. But my experience today made me think that is just an overpriced place to avoid. As most Greenhouse fans will tell you, the pomme frites are probably the best in Cleveland and something I always have to order. You used to be able to substitute the pomme frites for the chips when you ordered a lamb burger or a beef burger, but now they no longer allow substitutions. I'm not a fan of the chips, because all you taste is vinegar, so I was annoyed that the chips were my only option and I can't even pay an upcharge to get pomme frites with my meal.  Instead, you have to order a $7 appetizer of pomme frites (who orders French fries for an appetizer?!) and the serving size is so small as to only feed one person as opposed to the 2 or 4 people sitting at the table. Our table ended up ordering pomme frites for each person due to the meager serving portion and the grand total was $28--for French fries. They also charge $4 for soda, which is another recent upcharge on their menu. Save yourself the money and annoyance and go to Bar Cento--their food is just as good and won't break the bank."}
{"text":"We wandered in our first evening in the city and fortunately got seated promptly at the bar. I liked this quirky-looking place and found the food and drink interesting and high quality. The iced tea and hot tea are good. I had a large vegetarian burger and salad. I don't usually seek meat for dinner, so was thankful for these options, which were high quality."}
{"text":"The food and service are both fantastic! I recommend the four course tasting menu; it's an unbeatable price and a great selection of food. 

I've tried the warm bread & butter board, foie gras steamed clam, roasted pig head, animal style frites, and popcorn pot de creme. I highly recommend all of those!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Definitely do the 3 course option + desert.... that is the best way to experience this restaurant (even though it might cost a little more).  Food is delicious!  Menu might take a minute to figure out, but the servers can explain things for you and make suggestions.

Only draw back is the staff is not the best.  First time I was here, our waitress had an attitude and was almost condescending with how she described the menu items.  The last time I was here our server made a mistake on the bill and took almost 10 minute to circle back to our table and then another 10 minutes to resolve the issue.

Definitely worth a try if you haven't been... one of the more unique and popular restaurants in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"JUST DON'T GO.

Salt, SAlt, SALt, SALT, SALTLY, SALTLYEST.......

5 strikes and yer out.
To the edible: (not returned!)
(1)Cold pea and avocado soup - it was cold, but tasted neither of pea or avocado.
The semi-edible: (returned to kitchen 50% uneaten)
(2)Hamburger, the bun was palatable, the meat salted to destruction, the chips a SALT lick. Ate the bun.
The inedible: (returned to kitchen 99% uneaten)
(3)Chicken wings - wings themselves verging on acceptable, until, the lemon/vinegar(?)/WTF/&SALT topping was added 
(4)Big Caesar Salad - a romaine heart topped with a vomitus thirsty-2 ouncer of dressing that started it's life in the Great Salt Lake 
(5)The wait staff: neither concerned nor curious about the returned food, or the complaint that the food was the 'worst food I've ever been served'. 
The response: the manager is out right now, and yes the kitchen does believe they make good food but are too busy to discuss this (week day afternoon at 2p) and gee would you like more water - come back REAL soon!

Brushed my teeth 3 times before dinner to try to rid the salt taste - to little avail.

Should change it's name to Salt Lick - 

My displeasure is such, that I joined to be able to write this.
IT IS THAT BAD.

{"text":"I don't get it.

I thought I would love it, because many of the restaurants I enjoy most are built upon a philosophy of local, sustainable, and seasonal ingredients which are treated with the respect and care they deserve. All the recommendations I've had from my Cleveland friends told me that The Greenhouse was such a place, and one that rated visiting on one of my too-rare stops in Cleveland. Yet the experience was - and this is the only word to describe it - bizarre. 

Their rendition of a Cleveland standard, stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, was stellar, but from there the meal descended into chaos.  Was the Greenhouse was going for the 'greenest' of cuisine, minimalist dishes where the ingredients saw as little preparation as possible, or more of a stylized, structured 'haute' cuisine? We couldn't tell, and neither really worked. The appetizer of roasted peppers with smashed garlic was an example of the former - the two main ingredients were simply treated and mixed upon the plate, the garlic somewhat in and out of its paper, which stuck to the moist pepper skin, making for a ridiculous looking plate and an unpleasant eating experience.   The 'Mushroom Bear Claw' - a cinnamon bun like roll of mushrooms in puff pastry -- arrived looking stunning amidst the rich miso broth it sat upon. While the pastry was good and the stuffing tasty, the miso was both so acidic and so salty that it ruined the dish by overpowering the delicacy of the woodear mushroom filling.  A main course of white bean polenta, Lee Jones vegetables, and tofu occupied the opposite end of the spectrum - that food had been tortured into a structured submission by the chef:  the excellent seasonal vegetables had been tourned (properly, I should note), and placed next to tofu and a perfectly square polenta cake. The highly stylized dish was an odd followup to the minimalist pepper appetizer - and why, if you are showing off the quality of your ingredients, touting Chef's Garden as a supplier, would you tourne them?  The dish might have been fine were it not for the brine that the elements sat in. My date tried to eat just the top of the excellent polenta as that which had soaked up the extremely salty broth was inedible.  My entrée, the Duck Pasta, was supposed to be duck livers and craklins, roasted red onion, and local apples with a cavatelli-like pasta and toasted bread crumbs. The pasta arrived limp and overcooked, with none of the other ingredients discernable - supposedly they must have been the spaetzele-like brown crumbs that coated the pasta. Or was that the breadcrumbs? Or were they ground into the sauce on the pasta? We had no idea.  It seemed to be another rather stylized dish that might have been just sub par were it not for - again - an incredible amount of salt that rendered it truly unpleasant.. Unlike my date's main course, this could not be salvaged by selectively eating parts. After my date agreed, we asked for the check.

Good points: Our server had an excellent (albeit slightly overzealous) knowledge of beer, and recommended to my date a selection that she really enjoyed. They also handled our dissatisfaction well, by removing some items from the bill and offering free desserts (which we declined, as we wanted to leave and find something else to eat).

If I lived in Cleveland, I would go back again as our experience defies everything I have ever heard about the Greenhouse, but as a visitor who loves Cleveland's culinary scene, I'll be looking to other restaurants when I next return."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food, with a menu so fresh you should slap it.  They may like their pork, but I loved their burger.  Their sides are a little small but very tasty.  Rillettes with your bread instead of butter?  Grilled ramps?  Say no more."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and amazing. They had great veg food and a delicious loose red tea, which was delightful as I don't drink and I was able to enjoy it while my mom had a libation."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for the first time tonight and were totally disappointed with our meal and the service.  I can't imagine why others have rated this so highly.  We both had the halibut with smoked potatoes entree.  The fish was beyond bland even though it was served with a sauce -- also tasteless.  We told our wait person that it had no taste and asked for some lemon and salt and pepper.  She didn't comment at all on our complaint but did go to get s&p and lemon for us.  This made the dish more palateble but still not worth the $26 price.  Our server, \"144 Backus,\" made no response to our complaint, such as \"I'm sorry you don't like it,\" or \"can I get you something else,\" etc.  We will NEVER return -- bad experience."}
{"text":"TOURIST REVIEW 

Came here pregame before a Cleveland Indians game. Got the Chicken Wings with onions / garlic and I think jalapeno and they were awesome. Also got some gin fancy cocktail that knocked me on my ass. Great place and AWESOME wings!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the atmosphere was sports bar. I was expecting more interesting organic food and not fries and hamburgs. With a \"greenhouse\" image alluding to the  movement for healthy foods it turns out it is just tavern fare with a hyped up chef.."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years. Service has dropped pretty considerably not to mention portion
Size..We decided to give it another shot because they had an \"igloo\" setup outside. Walked in and asked about it, were told it had no heater but they were taking reservations. We signed up for a couple seats, then we were noticed the next day they require 4 people in the table. Okay. We cancelled and won't spend another dollar there. If you want good food and fun atmosphere there's plenty of better choices in downtown."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to eat here for Valentine's Day. However, we were really disappointed in the food and the seating. We made reservations a few days in advance, but were seated in the tightest, smallest two-top with a wall blocking my view of the restaurant. We were seated so close to the table next to us that we may as well have been eating with them. It was really uncomfortable and ruined a lot of the experience for me because we felt weird even having our own conversation. I get trying to get as many people in as possible but it was a little ridiculous how close those tables were. Then when the food came out we were disappointed once again. I got the duck breast and my boyfriend got the lamb chop special. I expected a sliced duck breast but it wasn't. Instead they give you two duck strips laid on top of each other like grilled chicken strips. We were so confused by the presentation that we thought they forgot the duck! The flavor was good but man for $32 I thought I would actually get a real duck breast. The portions were also really small. His chops were good, but also not quite worth the $42 price tag. Overall the food was underwhelming and the seating was extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"It was date night.  With my 8 year old. Yes, that is what I said.  For whatever reason I was stuck to find a place to take my daughter out for a date.  Do we go to a chain restaurant, do we get take-out.  It was on Twitter that someone reminded me about Greenhouse Tavern.  I have been here before, many times, but it was the last place I thought I could take my daughter.  To my daughter's credit, she is adventurous when it comes to food.  This is a kid who once got down on roasted bone marrow, then demolished a plate of goat cheese macaroni and cheese. So once I looked over the menu, as adventurous as it is, I wasn't worried.  

We started with the gravy frites.  This is a lovely guilty pleasure dish.  Any little voice in your head that is screaming because you are on a diet is quickly drowned out by the lovely brown gravy.  

For dinner I ordered the Steak Frites, and my daughter ordered the Grass Fed Ohio Beef Burger.  

The Ohio Beef Burger came topped with tomato, onion, pickle, and then topped with a terrific tangy cheese.  On the side, Chef Sawyer's very own pickle and famous frites.  

The steak was terrific, perfectly cooked, and coupled with the same frites as my daughter.  I couldn't have been happier with the dinner selections, but what really made this nice was the attention the server paid to my daughter.  Always asked her first what she would like.  That was the most important.  

The service was impeccable, attentive servers, a quick kitchen and a reasonable bill at the end of the meal. 

I can't say enough good things.  Thanks Chef and staff for such a great memorable date with my daughter."}
{"text":"Went for 25th anniversary with my kids, all meals came out overcooked and cold. My son's steak went back twice to get pink. My burger went back twice then I gave up and did not eat. Manager only offered dessert and still charged for the whole meal. Bad experience"}
{"text":"Padlock the door, and throw away the key, because this place is done.  We used to LOVE The Greenhouse, but this will be our last visit.  Tonight they featured a far too simplified menu, unseasoned steak tartar with a cold, undercooked egg, over salted rabbit pasta, and an over cooked steak. At least the beer was good. Oh wait, they don't make that. So apparently Chef Sawyer is too busy with other projects to make sure his flagship stays afloat. Too bad. Two years ago I preferred The Greenhouse to Lola, but now I prefer The Happy Dog to The Greenhouse.  Considering this restaurant?  Reconsider your choice."}
{"text":"I was completely underwhelmed! I had heard so many great things about this place, so I decided to bring important customers out. Man, was I embarrassed! Limited beer and wine list, disjointed menu, 2 entrees were sold out and the table was an antique (we kept hitting the legs with our knees). The braised short ribs was really ridiculous! The server should have cautioned my choice...it is not necessary to serve that much meat to one person!!"}
{"text":"I went to Greenhouse Tavern with a friend looking for a cocktail on an early Friday evening with no plans to eat. Out of the choices on East 4th, this seemed the most intriguing.  I was immediately impressed by the inviting, comfortable, rustic atmosphere and became even more impressed when learning about the way Greenhouse conducts its business, committing to sustainability by using local ingredients and remaining environmentally conscious in its business decisions.

The bar was full when we got there so we snagged a spot on the side.  We decided on some one of a kind cocktails that were perfect for what we were looking for and of course deliciously potent.  While chatting and drinking, we were seduced by all the pommes frites passing by.  We couldn't resist and ordered the basic garlic and rosemary variety. Needless to say, we didn't have any trouble finishing them. I can't wait to go back and try Greenhouse's version of \"poutine\" and I have to note that I especially loved the homage to In N' Out with the Animal Style Fries, though Greenhouse's version looks to be Animal Style on steroids.

I can't wait to go back and have a full meal and may just do that next week when I am in town..."}
{"text":"I had one of my favorite meals ever at this spot. I went for dinner with a few friends last night to Greenhouse Tavern, and I have to say it was absolutely incredible. Between the 3 of us, we shared 2 tasting menus, and it was more than we could eat, but none of us wanted to stop. Highlights were the chicken wings and the short ribs and the pig head. Our server Ally was lovely and the service was great. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ah! Not the greatest and given the price, a significant disappointment. Drinks were only OK (need a bit heavier pour) and the fish dish (halibut undercooked then replaced by bland walleye) lacked imagination and flavoring of the accompaniments. Service reasonable."}
{"text":"Went to Greenhouse for lunch after getting a recommendation on facebook from Michael Symon. We ordered the Siracha(sp?) wrap w/ chickpeas and the french bread pizza. It was clear that Greenhouse uses seasonal and local ingredients, which accounts for the way their food tastes. The veggie wrap was good, but lacked the spiciness I was expecting. As far as vegetarian dishes go, I wasn't overly impressed. The french bread pizza, however, stole the show. The baguette it was baked on was crusty and fresh. The cheese it was topped with was perfectly melted and the heirloom tomatoes on it were gorgeous as well as delicious. I forgot to mention that the salads that accompanied these dishes were amazing. Light, fresh & with great dressing. If I am in the area again, I will be curious to come back and see how the menu has changed!"}
{"text":"Rooftop bar in the summer is a very cool spot to hang out. Very trendy industrial atmosphere. However, it is very crowded and difficult to find a seat or get served at the bar. Apart from that, the drinks were outstanding- the bartenders were great. My group had a cosmopolitan and a couple Long Island iced teas- all very tasty! If you're up for climbing a few flights of stairs to get to the roof, this bar is lots of fun!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and my dinner (rigatoni with duck confit) was excellent (as was the brussels sprout appetizer).  However, my husband ordered the short ribs and they were inedible.  Crazy fatty and tough - not like any properly prepared short rib I've ever had.  We were informed they were prepared \"sous vide\" as if that should justify how unappetizing they were, and with a tone that maybe we're just not sophisticated enough to appreciate them. They did offer to replace it and did so, but only with a further condescending remark about how steaks have fat.  I mean really.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt given the ratings, but this is the second inedible meal I've received from them. I couldn't help feeling that the emperor has no clothes. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been putting off writing this review, because I wanted to make sure that I was clear-headed (in other words, well- rested and not excessively cranky) enough to write it to the best of my ability. So, here goes.

Greenhouse Tavern provided me with one of the best dining experiences of my entire life! I can count on one hand the times I've had a truly memorable, delicious, well- rounded, eclectic meal with superb food and drink in a unique environment. (Other places in CLE that fit this description include the W.6th Crop, Dante, and the now-closed Bar Symon (R.I.P., pork cracklins).

Derek and I went here for our third wedding anniversary. A night off from the world of high chairs and smushed banana is a plus to begin with, but add to that a warm, beautifully decorated atmosphere, attentive staff, and mouth-watering food, and you've got me paying attention.

We decided to each get the tasting menu at $44 apiece. Soooo worth it, because we got a three courses as well as a choice of either a half or dessert. Although the Animal frites sounded remarkably heart- attack provoking, and therefore awesome, I decided to go for the dessert.

Here's what we got.

Me: beet salad, goat pasta, Ohio beef burger, Dobos torte.

Him: bacon-wrapped apples, duck pasta, and a WHOLE BEEF SHIN. Yes, it was ridiculous, and I'm including pictures. People were staring and laughing. (Possibly pointing too.) we ate that delectable, tender pot roast for a whole week. Did I mention they included the bone? Six pounds in all. And yes, we took the bone home too. To add insult to injury, he got the buttered popcorn pot du creme for dessert.

Everything was amazing. My only criticism was that the fries that came with my burger were way too salty. But everything else was great.

I love the extensive beer list, the kinda-casual, but still trendy, atmosphere (because there's only a handful of days out of the year when I can pretend to be trendy, and I kinda wanna fit in), and the bottle of water that remained on the table for us to refill our glasses, even though it wasn't really needed, because we got refills from the servers approximately once every eight minutes.but it was a nice thought.

I will fantasize about this meal for months, and when I return, I probably won't be as impressed, because I'm negative and cynical like that. But I'm glad that I have this memory in my mind of Greenhouse, and I'd like for it to stay there for quite some time."}
{"text":"A ton of cool menu items, very friendly staff, and the food is fantastic.  My only problem was that I couldn't eat it all, which is a good problem to have.  I absolutely love this place and I want to go back to Cleveland just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour/dinner at the bar. Not a great HH beer menu, but arguably the best veggie burger I've ever had. Service at the bar was great too. I can't speak to the rest of the menu, but the veggie burger and rosemary frites get a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"The grilled salmon with kale salad I had for lunch was tasty.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Patio is great for people watching too."}
{"text":"The food and cocktails are among the best in Cleveland. The chicken wings and animal style fries are phenomenal- I'm still dreaming about them. I was expecting this place to be a bit pretentious since it has a more sophisticated menu but the service was friendly and people were dressed in all kinds of attire. It's worth spending a little more money here than you would at other restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on bizarre foods America, I knew I needed to go, and what better way to celebrate the Steelers getting into the playoffs than half a pigs head?

Four of us went after the game, and were surprised it was better than tv and the menu made it sound like. The small portion of animal frites was a meal in itself, and I would drink the gravy from glass, but the star of the show was definitely the pig head. The sauce took me a minute to get used to, but the meat and fat were tender and delicious. I've now made 2 meals from it and still have more left, so definitely worth the price. 

The only negative any of us had was that they were sold out of chicken wings, which having tried other dishes, is completely understandable and just gives us a reason to go back the next time we're in town. 

Even if you live in Pittsburgh like we do, invent a reason to go to Cleveland to eat here, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place last night with my wife.  I cannot fault the food, it really was amazing.  The service was excellent and the server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.

Our situation was one in which my wife subbed a side salad for fries.  She was brought one type of salad, which didn't not go well with the dish; and then the server brought a different type of salad which was also very strongly flavored.  It seems to be a case of every dish being made to excite the palate and have dominant flavors, but this means that they may not necessarily go together well when combined.  

I would suggest to at least have a less dominantly flavored side salad that can work well without competing with the flavors of the main entree items on the menu.  She had to stop eating because she was overwhelmed by all of the different flavors."}
{"text":"Even though it's known widely for its dinner menu, I think the stars of the show here are the incredible service and the pastry chef. We've had the best wait staff here, they are super knowledgeable about the menu and very approachable, especially for a fairly upscale restaurant. I've had some incredible desserts here as well, my usual rule here is if there is something that sounds a little unusual on the dessert menu here you should definitely try it, you're in good hands."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place and arrived with my brother's family (real Clevelanders who love the city and are wonderful folks), but try as we might this place took the evening to a lower level! I've never been to a rodeo but figure I now know what it is like to wrestle a steer after tussling with my steak which came out saddle tough and as tasty as said saddle! The frites were ok but what amateur can't cook a spud! Wine and beers not crafted at the restaurant are simply a choice of vendors. Next, my wife--being a little price conscious, and this place for what they do is way out of line on the pricing--opted for one of her favorite dishes which is a beet salad! Who can disappoint with a beet salad? Well we found out who! Not only was the beet salad a disappointment for the price but it was actually an insult to my wife and certainly an embarrassment for whoever put it on a plate and approved it actually being served in public! It was served on a large plate and we knew it was a large plate because we could see the entire plate except for where a very, very tiny smattering of small beet cubes and slivers, 4 crushed pistachios, 3 USPS stamp sized tears of a green leafy substance that might be lettuce or possibly spinach and 6 paper thin slices of radish rested on the side. At first we thought that it was a joke because of the salad's price and that the waiter must have eaten the actual salad before it arrived but when we realized this was it the laughter ended in stunned silence! We didn't know quite how to take it. Return the plate, literally, sans salad as it arrived sans salad? or continue to think of it as a joke and simply vow never to return to this place again. We took a photo of it and now we have a running family joke and the brunt of the joke is Greenhouse Tavern! Anyway long story short: when in Cleveland do yourself a favor when you walk by the Greenhouse Tavern and feel the pangs of hunger, simply keep on walking to any other restaurant located on this plaza. One star is way too much for this place as it is more like a black hole sucking the life and light out of the evening! Plus the Astros crushed the Indians that night on 6 July 2015! Maybe nothing was going right for Cleveland that night!! We still love to visit Cleveland but only hope that the Greenhouse Tavern will shutter their doors and upgrade the city dining experience! My take away is the half eaten whole pig's head at the table next to us with its toothy grin mocking me silently getting the last laugh!"}
{"text":"Very very spicy greens and beans. Dry aged steak frites. Remember to share with a friend!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I went to after moving to Cleveland.  My brother and sister in law loved the place and swore by the wings.  They didn't disappoint.  Sawyer has a great menu and good drinks.  Buffalo Trace is the house bourbon and they make a good Manhattan.  

Best to make a reservation, especially with sporting events downtown."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience, super friendly staff, excellent food!  Those crispy chicken wings!!!  Short and sweet-  a must go to establishment.  And don't forget to order those wings."}
{"text":"It's almost silly to give GHT yet another 5 star review--but I'm a newly-formed believer, and I *must* pass on the message. 

On an earlier expedition here to Cleveland I've had GHT, but my impression of lackluster food with snottish service (and tons of bikes in awkward positions) left me empty inside, and poor, very, very poor. Honestly, I don't know what was wrong with me...must've been that time of the month. :-P

In the past week and a half, I've been back *3* times. What happened, you ask.... I FOUND HAPPY HOUR. (Seriously though, even without happy hour, I'd be back again). (But no, seriously, happy hour is amazing). My favorite item -- their crispy chicken wings, is a 36% off. Piles of deliciously cooked chicken in a lime, jalapeno, green onion medley... mmm... salivations.

Other noteworthy dishes include:
- appetizer bread order -- fantastic mix and quantity and flavor. Yum.
- short ribs -- what they *don't* tell you is that it's huge. It'll feed 4 small people (excluding hobbits) or 2 largish ones. (No judgment. You decide what you are.)

As to service -- let's just say I'm thinking about naming my daughter Sam, if I ever have a daughter."}
{"text":"After a recent Cleveland Playhouse show, my wife and I went for a Reverse Happy Hour.  We sat at the bar and the bartender took good care of us.  We ordered drinks and decided to sample a few items from the happy hour menu (and beyond).

We ordered three dishes to share...crispy chicken wings confit, poutine and a burger.  The chicken wings were very crispy and fairly salty but had a wonderful flavor.  They are served with jalapenos, lemon and garlic...a wonderfully unique combination.  Their version of poutine was a real rock star, covered with mozzarella curds and a peppery brown gravy (fries were cooked perfectly).  Lastly, the burger was cooked to a perfect temp and served with a side of house made chips.

Great meal and a fun time hanging out at the bar.  Thank GHT!"}
{"text":"Went back for takeout the other night and they were quick and easy.  Food was great as usual."}
{"text":"Hit or miss for dinner. The brussel sprouts were great. The tobasco barrel aged fried chicken was good. The chicken wings confit were overdone and tough. The dressing on top was also an overpowering lime flavor. The beer could have been colder. The guy refilling the water glasses did a good job. Our server was very courteous and attentive. Overall we received a big bill for an underwhelming meal and we didn't order expensive menu items."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch sometimes. Sometimes I really like it, other times I don't as much.  The recently changed the menu, and have this good pho sandwich... it was delicious. Although, they really are too expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Mind blown!!!  Came here to celebrate my brother-in-law's birthday on a Saturday.  Make reservations if you want to get in!

Our table for 8 guests wasn't ready immediately upon arrival and we had to wait about 15 minutes.  We ordered at the bar but felt very \"in the way\" so it was uncomfortable.  One round of French 75s and Cream Sodas for the table cost a pretty penny ($90) and it took a while but deeelish!

When we went to be seated, it was a crazy maze to get to our table but we were pleasantly surprised with a spot on the second floor overlooking the entire restaurant. Cool view, cool vibes.

When our waitress approached and asked if we wanted drinks, we said no because we had just started drinking the round from the bar and she looked visibly pissed!!  Bad start but she recovered. She had so much detailed knowledge about the dishes! Strange bird but smart. And luckily the birthday boy mentioned he wanted to try the short ribs and she told him to put the order in early because it took one full hour to make!!!  She ended up being a great server.

FOOD - whoa! We ordered everything! For apps, The the chicken wings are the best wings in the world!!!!! The Brussels sprouts were crispy yet soft and caramelized.  For entrees, the short ribs were really gimmicky because it's a hilariously large serving but two guys split it and enjoyed the MHEAT! The fish of the day (grouper) was just so-so. The jalapeño fried chicken was wonderful, no grease!  Also got a couple strip steaks and veggie burger - both were a big hit!

My personal fave of the night aside from the wings and Brussels were the animal style frittes!!!! I've never had putin because when you're feeling for some comfort food, this is it!!

Overall great place with an eclectic menu that really has something for everyone. Don't be afraid of the weird descriptions / fancy words ;-)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants Cleveland has to offer.
I came in with my crew for some Picklebacks, I was amazed with the shot. The kicker is they actually make their own pickles here.

Great attentive waitstaff with a wonderful knowledge about food as well as the city. Their fries are so money!

The decor is cool, the atmosphere is cool, this is just one cool place that everyone should experience at least once. I came here twice during my 3 day stay in the city. I hope too come back soon.

Bonus, the main TV was showing \"The Wizard of Oz\" on VHS. If that's not cool, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"Been here 5 times. One of my favorites downtown. Buttered popcorn pot de creme my friend. This is the salty sweet creamy dessert you never knew but once you taste it you will want it again. It is served in a way too small cup and I really want to buy it by the half gallon, or at least the quart.

The animal frites are great although you need a nap afterwards. Every salad I have had here has been amazing. I hope to try the pig's head one day but have not gone there yet. Lamb burger is very tasty although not as good as Lucky's Cafe IMO."}
{"text":"Their Ohio Beef burger was incredible. Angus beef, raclette cheese, fresh tomato and lettuce - that's it. Simple, but fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"It's called a tavern. What kind of tavern has only 4 beers on draft?
The food is pricey considering the portion size. You don't get a lot of food for the big $$$ you pay. 
The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. I enjoyed all the music they played, but the music is so loud that everyone ends up yelling over each other trying to talk. We called ahead for seating and got sat down pretty quickly considering it was a Saturday night. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the menu. We started out with an order of chicken wings and brussel sprouts. They came out super quick. The chicken wings were fall off the bone. I've never had a chicken wing that fell off the bone like that, but they were super salty and vinegary. I only had a little piece of the Brussel sprouts so I couldn't judge. 
My main dish was the hare ragu. I know it's weird to say but it was too meaty and not enough pasta. They plated the ragu to the side of one plate, which made it look like you were getting even less food. 
Everyone enjoyed the meal, but I definitely would've enjoyed it more if it didn't cost an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Great cider list and down homey Ohio food.

Had the jerky plate, gnocchi, pork Ragu and beef tartare.  Loved the whole sweet corn kernels throughout the food."}
{"text":"Came here for bachelor party, probably never see our bachelor friend again. Awesome atmosphere, house lager is excellent, wings are to die for, and arugula pommes frites unbeknownst to us are french fries. That is all."}
{"text":"If you're in CLE, you have to check this place out! This is Chef Jonathon Sawyer's masterpiece but like all artists, he's never satisfied and always looking to improve.

It's all about the food here. It's a hipster hangout but it stays non pretentious. If Greenhouse was in L.A., it would take weeks to get a reservation and every menu item would cost at least five dollars more. Enjoy the fact that it's in CLE and you can get in fairly easily.

Here are some of my favorite dishes here. Foie Gras steamed clams, the best clam dish I have ever had, don't let them take the broth away until you finish it. Hand ground beef tartare, words cant describe how good this dish is. Ohio lamb burger, lamb at it's finest. Veil sweetbread meatballs, I don't know if these thymus glands are even on the menu yet, sorry if they aren't but they are fantastic! Halibut collar, the best pacific halibut you will ever have.

I have enjoyed a lot of restaurant's in this town but this is the only one I will truly miss. Cheers to Chef Jonathon Sawyer, I would give you six stars if I could!"}
{"text":"In Cleveland on business looking for a nice meal, a little late.  After walking from my hotel thru the apocalyptically desolate streets of downtown, I happened on E 4th St.  Now, that's a fun neighborhood.

So, the restaurant.  Service started off good, but the waitress got talking to her friends and became inattentive.  She suggested the oak-aged Manhattan.  Good, but almost too smooth for my taste, the bourbon had no kick.  The steak frites were awesome.  I got the strip version. ($60 bucks for a ribeye??) It was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  The fries and aioli were awesome.

The only miss of the night - dessert.  Got the s'mores tort. Menu says it's smoked chocolate, but it's pretty obviously chocolate with liquid smoke drizzled over it - unevenly.  The graham cracker crust was too crunchy.

Nice decor, cool vibe, good food.  I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Had a Monday night reservation. Sat by the window and had a great server, Brian. 
Ordered the tasting menu, started with the charred ramps served with kimchi, lemon and nuts. Followed by the foie gras steamed clams in a white wine sauce, excellent, glad they serve it with bread to soak up the broth. Speaking of bread, they start your meal with bread served with butter and a pork rillete, yum. Had the GHT salad as my half taste (you could opt for dessert instead). It was simple but delicious,  I love blue cheese and pine nuts, it was a small amount, but yummy. For my larger entree I had the pork chop saltimbocca. It was like pork served three ways with a red eye gravy. The loin was wrapped in bacon,  then there was scrapple mixed with cornmeal, plus the \"fattier\" part that almost had a carmeliztion on it, it was served under a mash potato puree that was silky smooth. Very good and an excellent portion.
For cocktails I had the GHT Pimm's Cup. And the 4th Street Flip, which was my favorite, I had it as dessert as its on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Greenhouse is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  Everything I've had is fantastic and they've had plenty of chances to mess it up--I've been here around a dozen times.  As far as must have's, the Animal Frites are incredible.  As is the Ohio Burger and the Gnocchi.  The drink list is great as well; my recommendation is the Get Behind the Mule--their take on a Moscow Mule with vodka, scotch and bitters."}
{"text":"Haven't dined here yet, but the roof bar is one of the cooler spots I've been in Cleveland. Fairly expensive for drinks, but they have the sustainable model, so I don't blame them. Had a drink with a local Vodka.  That was pretty good stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch here. I was really pleased, husband gives it a so-so. 

Starting with drinks I ordered a cappuccino and a virgin Bloody Mary (give me ALL the drinks). I was pleased they could do the virgin for me because I was absolutely craving a bloody but had a long drive ahead of me after we ate. It was delicious, very spicy, a little salty, and had a strong olive taste. Cappuccino looked pretty, tasted decent enough. Nothing spectacular with that. 

For food I ordered pastrami hash - oh. my. god. The meat was sooo good. Parts of it were nice and crunchy like it was a good piece of bacon, other parts were fatty and stringy like a good hunk of corned beef. Instead of typical toast (white, rye), they grill a hunk of sourdough bread. Perfect to sop up your egg with. The hash was small diced potatoes, red onion, and red bell pepper. I loved his dish. 

Husband got the classic \"steak and eggs\" dish that also came with hash. He loved the hash, but did not like the quality of the steak, and did not appreciate the sourdough instead of regular toast. I guess this is a preference thing. 

Our server was really nice and did a good job. The price is a little steep because this is definitely a trendy spot, not like a small 24/7 breakfast diner. You pay for the ambiance of 4th street and whatnot. Would definitely recommend for a breakfast spot that is innovative and trendy."}
{"text":"For an East 4th restaurant it was OK. I liked that there was a lot of vegetarian options for those of us who don't eat meat.  It is a pretty crowded place.  Perfect before Cavs games."}
{"text":"The last time I dined at Greenhouse Tavern was with some really good friends of our and the service and food was excellent, however this time was just a bit different. It's sad when a restaurant gets too big for it's britches. My daughter is in town from CA and  was really wanting to try Greenhouse because of everything she's heard so six of us tried to get a reservation for Tuesday night. Unfortunately they weren't taking them due to two huge parties that took over the restaurant for the night. They did however have seating outside and above the bar. Our friend got there a bit early and put her name in. They said it would be about a thirty minute wait because they wanted to seat us at this round table. The hostess said she would call her on her cell when the table opened up. Well we all waited thirty minutes and the party in question had no intention of leaving so we asked if they could pull two tables together that were just sitting there empty for thirty minutes and were told that they don't do that. Really! Here is a party of six waiting and wanting to dine at your restaurant and you would rather leave the seating empty. We decided to eat elsewhere and by the way, the hostess never called my friend!"}
{"text":"Overall, a good restaurant, but I have a few minor quibbles.

I visited on a Tuesday night, and the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  The pros:  quick and efficient service, nifty ambiance from the \"reclaimed\" look of much of the decor, and reasonable portion sizes.

I had the soup of the day (vegetable) and the duck and pumpkin pasta.  The soup was very reminiscent of a veggie soup my grandma would make in the fall and winter.  Oh, the nostalgia!

The duck pasta, while tasty, was quite high in sodium.  The cooks definitely need to lighten up on the salt-shaker.

The only other con? The price - but only on certain items.  Granted, you're paying for decent quality, but -- 6 bucks for ONE cup of vegetable soup?  Nostalgia or no, it was still a little pricey, in my opinion.  On the other hand, I think $21 was a reasonable price to pay for the pasta.

Despite my quibbles, I would return, especially since I'm curious about whether they salt their other entrees as heavily as the duck pasta.  Oh, and I didn't get to try dessert.  :)"}
{"text":"Love the food at GHT.  Seriously good eats.  I love their focus on local meats and seasonal produce; for me, this automatically gives them 4 stars if the food is up to par.  

However, their service is off putting.  The first time we went  [on a Friday evening for date night], we had the times of our lives.  The waitress was pleasant, informative and knew when to leave us alone.  The last two times I have been there [on a Friday for date night and then again with a group lunch], the service left a bitter taste in my mouth, completely ruining the amazing veggie torpedo that I had just inhaled (yes, both times).  A little snooty and pretentious, the servers and their attitude can rub you the wrong way.  

Snooty and pretentious as the service may be, the food lives up to it."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars? Because things just aren't what you expect.

   ---   ---   ---

I'm all about things being unique... I'd say I even go out of my way to find uniqueness in restaurants. But there's a certain line that gets crossed, in which an apple is no longer even an apple. It's an orange.

The wings at Greenhouse look like wings, for the most part. But they don't taste remotely like the wings that most people know. They are citrusy, dry, and fall apart as you touch them. More so than wings, I'd describe them as lemon chicken flakes. They did not float my boat.

I kept is simple for my main entree by ordering a burger. There was some funky cheese present that kind of overwhelmed each bite. It was ok at best.

To be honest, I'm probably rounding up to 3 stars here. The menu is interesting enough that if I lived in Cleveland, I'd go back and try some different things, but I've got quite the commute ahead of me to make a return trip."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it did not meet our expectations. I am willing to pay handsomely for a great meal. Unfortunately, I found the prices way too high for the quality of the food. The pork chop was recommended to me. I would declare it just ok. My husband had the tartare and same reaction - just ok. Save your money and go eat a pizza. You will be happier."}
{"text":"Went in for a late dinner and loved it! Had a lamb burger and the beef tartare, both were fantastic! Great experience and it wasn't expensive at all. Burger and the beef tartare were like both around $9 each. Great service and good food, only one thing that bugged me was my table smelled a little bad, probably the towel used to clean it smelled funky. Other than that, service, food, was great!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place before going to the Cleveland Indians game for dinner not what I expect the waiter never brought my drink I ordered a Diet coke and a water she brought my water but no diat coke. The food was ok not that great it could be a little better but I guess if you wanna eat healthy this is the place to come. Oh and the fuynny thing was I got charged for the diet coke that never came to me. 

   So make sure when you go to pay that you check your bill and if its something you ordered but never got bring it to management attention."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating was because we were there so long. Other than that, I would suggest doing the Chef's tasting menu.  You get 5 courses, ranging from an amuse bouche, to a hearty main.  The starter was small and tasteful, a great start to the experience.  I had for my second bacon wrapped dates (devils horseback?).  I then proceeded to a special of the night, sausage cornbread, which was very good.  My next selection, which was enough for the whole table, was the animal frites.  French fries covered in gravy, mozzarella cheese, chunk bacon, and 2 fried eggs.  These were my favorite of the night. I decided for my main to get the Fred Flintstone, beef short ribs served on a turkey-sized platter.  A huge portion, with a great reduction sauce. Another person in my party had the pigs head, which was delicious. Definitely unexpected quality of food, would definitely go back when in town!"}
{"text":"I came into town for the Browns game and needed a place to eat so I tried the Greenhouse Tavern as most places in the area were already closed. I was blown away the service was top notch food was delicious and filling too. Plus there was a great crowd of people because of the game so it was very lively. Definitely worth a re-visit when I return."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland, exceptional ambiance, awesome food, unique decor, and wonderful staff. You cant go without having the Gravy Frites! Our last visit we had the Gravy Frites, Apple and Squash Creste Pasta, Monte Castro Sandwich, and Buttered Popcorn Pot de Crème. The pasta was perfect, not overwhelming with the apple, and big chunks a cheese, but the Monte Castro was so unique and full of flavor, I could eat one every day. BUT the Pot de Creme was so fantastic, I had never tasted anything like it, and could eat a tub of it. Wow what a unique desert and a perfect ending to the meal. Guaranteed you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"We went there prior to a ball game so perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind for this establishment. The menu didn't have a lot of options that sounded good to me and when I received my food - the portions were tiny. I barely had enough food to soak up my over-priced beer. Definitely geared to those desiring to be trendy and hip."}
{"text":"I love this place. I took a client here from out of town here to show him the best cleveland has to offer. He was struggling with the menu so we ordered some wings.  He was floored by how good they were. We eventually decided to order several dishes to share so that he could try more dishes. We went with (another order of wings), pommes frites, tongue and cheek tacos, the snapper special, and tartare. The snapper was excellent and the broth was really good. I wish I had more bread to soak it up in.  The tacos were extremely good.  The cheek was so tender it melted in your mouth. The tortillas were great and fresh real corn. You cant beat that. Its the first time I'd had the tacos and the tortillas made this a must from now on. I wish there had been more(I'm noticing a theme of wishing there was more of everything).  
Overall it was amazing. My client can't wait to come back and he loved the atmosphere. The staff was attentive and very knowledgeable.  There had been some changes to the menu since my last visit, and i appreciated the server being able to explain the items very well.  Manager Jonathan Blair also visited the table and helped make the evening a success

Well done GHT.  Cant wait to be back again"}
{"text":"After having horrible drinks and service at the chocolate bar we wandered down E 4th and popped in this place. The bartenders were AMAZING! They really knew how to make drinks and match everyone's palate."}
{"text":"Glad to see they have an expanded menu as of a Sept. 2015 visit.  Service at the bar was extremely good, and food came out fast.  TWO BIG THUMBS UP for having a half size order of animal frites on the menu now.  But let's be honest...2 PMSing women can easily knock off a full order (speaking from experience obviously) but now I can order wings and a half order of animal frites.  Score.  Their house wines are great, and they make some of the greatest cocktails.  Management is top notch."}
{"text":"I have a friend who raves about this place, but each time I've gone, I've honestly been just kind of turned off. The lamb burger is fine, I guess, I've had it three times. Nothing stood out to me.  The burger was greasy but then the lamb somehow managed to be kind of dry? I've also had the crispy chicken confit, the pommes frites, and the buttered pot de creme. And some other stuff that seems to no longer be on their menu... this one tiny, way overpriced hominy dish comes to mind...can't remember the others right now (I've been here four times over the course of almost two years). 
Maybe I'm crazy, because I know how much people like this place, but I honestly never leave wanting to go back.  I just end up here when others have wanted to go.  I think it's the vibe- it's that young professionals with money who haven't settled down and act like they're still in college/hipster/pretentious thing. You can tell just by reading the menu. It's really not my kind of hang, I guess!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants to go to, always consistently good. Depends on what you order, some dishes are better than others. You will find a lot of different choices, some very unique menu items like the fifth quarter or their pigs head. 
My favorite thing to get is the crispy chicken wings confit. Every time we go we end up getting two orders. Best wings you will have ever, they fall straight off the bone into your mouth. Absolutely amazing! The pot de creme is also amazing, sort of like creme brûlée but in my opinion better ( no crackly top, more like pudding). Their fries are excellent, as well as their market fish and lamb burger. The sauces that come with the entrees usually make the meal. Last night I had the foie grass mussels, and while the portion was very small I still went home full because of the chicken wings and an order of animal style fries for the table. 
Lovely to sit outside and enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"This is hands own my favorite Cleveland restaurant! They have a seasonal menu and try to go local as much as possible! I have never had anything that I don't like. From eh Vegetarian burger to the lamb burger. The wings or the veggie charcuterie. Always innovative. Great drinks! Wonderful assortment of wine and local as well s domestic beers!
The staff are always friendly!
Great vibe at the rooftop bar as well. Say hi to Shawn if he's there! He's doing some great things!"}
{"text":"This place has a great environment and the food is quite delicious.  My waitress was very informative as she explained each dish on the menu to help me in my selection process.  Had a tasting special so got 5 choices - everything was so uniquely flavorful. The chicken wings were amazing - crispy on the outside and moist inside with very unique flavor.  Had bass with Brussels sprouts and potatoes - sauce was delicious.  My dessert was Birch.  Too full so took it to go...

Great spot - will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I did a Jonathan Sawyer double header today and they struck out, sorry. I was really looking forward to the greenhouse tavern, but it just wasn't great. Our waitress forgot my appetizer of crispy fried chicken while my friend got his. When I was finally able to flag her down, she gave kinda lame excuse that she was gonna bring it out with my entree....my pork dish was laden with strips of fat. I know its pork..., the pomme frite w gravy was a bit of a hot gravy cheesy mess. Anyway, while the food tasted okay, presentation, service and food was less than stellar. Along with my lukewarm flavorless ramen from Noodlecat; and although Jonathan Sawyer just won the James Beard 2014 Award, I wouldn't come back.  3 stars for just a meh experience. I wish it was better."}
{"text":"Typical hipster place. Overpriced and underwhelming food. The famed chicken wings were overly salty. Barkeeps look though you if you aren't hipster enough (or white enough,  nothing new to report here same tribal experience in hipster establishments around the country). Beer selection  was very good as expected. You know what you're getting the minute you walk in and see the vintage bikes hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Nice atmosphere. Food is too salty. Even my salad was salty! Shared the half chicken for my entree. It 's wrapped in a nice pastry and brought out before the chef carves it so you can see the presentation. Again way too salty. I eat a limited amount of meat and a lot of the vegetarian options were sold out. Disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"I have been there several times for dinner, maybe 4 or 5. The food is a little ectletic and does not taste bad but every time I've gone there at least one person in my party has gotten sick. It has just been a reoccurring pattern. It must be a certain way they prepare their food. The service though has never been bad and everyone has always been nice."}
{"text":"Had the wings and the clams. Clams were good but the portion size was a bit small. Wings had good flavor and oration size was good. 

I had thought of having the pig's head but it cost $50 bucks-really meant for two people to share. Other items on the menu seemed over priced-prime steak house type prices. 

Oh yeah, also has the gravy fries; couldn't finish them but they were substantial and good."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern is, quite easily, one of Cleveland's best restaurants. The amount of press and buzz surrounding this restaurant in a little over a year is certainly well-deserved.

The tasting menu, at $37, is one of the best values in the city. Choose one of each course (4 courses in all, including dessert), or substitute the dessert for a half-course; it's your call. It's a refreshing change of most restaurants' tasting menus - you choose your own adventure, so to speak.

The wings are seriously the best in Cleveland. Bobby Flay pounded through many plates of those for a reason!  If you're feeling brave, go for the Ghost Wings, an off-the-menu dish made with the world's hottest pepper.

The Chef's Table is a fantastic experience - seats 4 and gives you an up-close and personal view of your food being prepared.

The staff is friendly, accommodating, and the service is top-notch.

Believe the hype, and go there SOON. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with very convivial and knowledgeable wait staff. The food is very innovative and not what you would expect from a quick look inside. They put the most interesting things together in a way that insures you will return. I wish my neighborhood had something like this!"}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to E4th and to the Cleveland scene. Love everything about this place from the decor to the drinks and the food. Yum. The only problem with it is my husband doesn't drink and they don't serve any non-alcoholic beers.. small price to pay for a fabulous meal and experience but I'll take it!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for the Indians versus Yankees MLB series this weekend. I went to this restaurant/tavern on E. 4th St. Let me just start out by saying E. 4th St is a really cool street it is has a European type look to it, the street is a very narrow street with cafes, coffee houses, bars and lounges on it and with some cool looking lights on the side of the buildings. This tavern has some really good food. I got the chicken and waffles, excellent by the way. They had a lot of really good option that I also wanted to try but I had get my chicken and waffles. I would recommend this place its a fun place to eat the atmosphere is pretty cool as well and the waiter was extremely friendly. Overall the place just had a cool vibe to it and the food was great. I would recommend this place if you are visiting Downtown Cleveland plus the restaurant is pretty close to the Q and Progressive Field and the famous Lebron billboard."}
{"text":"Wings are very different, but very good. Good addition to the east 4th strip but very pricey."}
{"text":"Greenhouse Tavern was exceptional. I love that all of their food is local and fresh, the menu is unique and the service was excpetional. It is a little over-hyped BUT I would definitley go back :) Make sure to make a reservation! I just think it is a Cleveland gem, take your friends from out of town!"}
{"text":"EASILY the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.

first we show up and there's a 30 minute wait, which is completely understandable on a Saturday in Cleveland. so we get some drinks at a bar next door and wait to be texted to come back for our table.

once we got seated, it took about 10 minutes for us to be greeted so we are off to a bad start already. when our server took our drink order, we asked about specials and she told us about some drink they had which had gin, st germain and green tea simple syrup, which sounded delicious so all 5 of us ordered that. after about 5 minutes she came back to the table to tell us that only 3 of us can have the drink.. so we were forced to decide who couldn't have the drink? which I wish I was one of the ones who wouldn't of gotten it because it was only about 5 ounces, and $12 for a semi-decent cocktail.

next, it's time to order (off the tiny happy hour menu which has MAYBE 12 items on it). one of the girls I was with ordered the hummus and they informed us that they haven't had hummus anymore but didn't change the menu? 

so the food arrives and she comes by to check on us and we are missing a side of pomme frites (fries) and she goes \"yeah that happens it takes them awhile to come up from the basement\". not a \"I'm sorry I'll go check on that for you\"

lastly, one of us ordered a miller highlife and she goes \"OH highlife\" with a look of disgust on her face. then once she brings the highlife she asks if he wants a champagne flute for it... which after the terrible attitude we've received for the whole visit, this was icing on the cake.

the food was decent but over priced, service was semi ok but her attitude was terrible and I will never be back because of that negative experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner here while in town to visit the R&R Hall of Fame. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Our waiter's recommendations were mostly spot-on. Delicious appetizers we had were fried brussels sprouts and chicken wings. Our friends had the bone in pork belly, which they loved. We had the Ohio beef burger, which was also scrumptious. Their fries are particularly yummy. For dessert we decided to try the bleu cheese ice cream. That was not so good; it just doesn't work as an ice cream! But the apple tart was perfect. Sit outside if you like to hear the music streaming out of the nearby clubs and people-watch."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but service was only mediocre. We ordered a bottle of white wine and it came out room temperature. Appreciated the decor."}
{"text":"***Greenhouse Tavern's tasting menu is a good value, but the food struggles to compete with the gastropubs and upscale causal cuisine you can find in LA; it is reminiscent of Haven (which has locations in Orange and Pasadena)***

Greenhouse Tavern sits next to Lola in Downtown Cleveland and it has built a little bit of a national reputation.  It was featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate and it was named as one of the ten best new restaurants in Bon Appetit Magazine.

Greenhouse Tavern is a gastropub and the decor has several gastropub elements--a dark decor, a bar prominently featured and a comfortable/casual environment.  There is a lot of rustic elements in Greenhouse Tavern as well.

The menu at Greenhouse Tavern reads well.  It is definitely a gastropub menu.  There are a lot of casual and hearty dishes that have been gussied up with nontraditional and seasonal ingredients.  I liked the heavy focus on local product from Ohio beef to Ohio beans.

The menu is a mix of small plates and larger plates; they also offer a 4-course tasting menu (I opted for this), which allows you to pick one of their small starters, a larger starter, an entree, and a dessert for $44.  It is a good value given the generous portion size on the entree as well as the flexibility to order many different dishes (some items require a supplemental charge).

The complimentary bread was kind of an old-fashioned soft bread.  It was served with pork rilettes, but it was a very small portion and lacked the flavor and creaminess of the pork rilettes I've had at other places like AOC.

My small starter was the Sloppy JO-Nut, which was a savory donut filled with coffee and cola braised beef and topped with a BBQ sauce.  There was also a small side of coleslaw.

The sloppy joe was just okay.  The beef was fine and relatively moist.  The BBQ sauce was fine though it was very similar to most BBQ sauces out there.  The donut bun was fine.

My second starter was a housemade pasta of goat cheese morel raviolini with wood ear mushrooms and zucchini.  It was easy to identify that the pasta was housemade.  It had a good texture--just the right amount of thickness and a good flavor.  The filling was good too.

The garnishes were okay, but it was a little overpowered by the use of too much lemon.

For my entree, I opted for the strip steak frites, which was a big portion.  The strip steak was topped with shallot mignonette and some fresh herbs.  The steak was nicely cooked; it was juicy.  The quality of the steak was kind of average (just an okay texture too).

The flavor of the steak was decent, but I did not like the shallot mignonette.

The fries were good though.  They were crispy and had a good flavor.

For dessert, I opted for the stoner sandwich, which was a waffle with a mint and pistachio parfait, chocolate sauce and chantilly cream.  The dessert sounded good, but it was surprisingly very bad.  The soft waffle had no flavor.  The flavor reminded me of a time when I accidentally made a waffle with flour instead of buttermilk pancake taste.

The chantilly cream was not bad.  The pistachio flavor was not really there though that happens with a lot of pistachio desserts.  There was a little bit of a mint flavor, but the chocolate flavor was really bad.  It had a real off-putting flavor and kind of a bad aftertaste.

Service was good.  My server was personable and polite.  The food came out at a good pace.

As mentioned, the 4-course tasting menu was a good value.  The other prices were about what you would expect to pay for a reputable gastropub.  They have a few premium dishes here that get quite expensive.

I was disappointed with Greenhouse Tavern.  After trying a lot of what Greenhouse Tavern had to offer and trying Lola, I wish I would have just spent two nights at Lola instead.  There were a few positive notes throughout the 4-course menu, but too many of the dishes were bland (and a few of the dishes had a bad flavor).  Because of that, I highly recommend Lola instead, which is more expensive but also significantly better.

Greenhouse Tavern is located right in Downtown Cleveland.  There are several nearby parking lots and structures (rates are high)."}
{"text":"I saw good reviews and thought maybe this will be an excellent choice for my birthday dinner.  We ordered the Clams, Duck Confit wings and shared the Pig's Head.  Clams-- were okay, I can make them better, and they only give you 4 clams!!!  It was a little too buttery and not warm enough.  Duck Confit wings, my fiance loved,... but I thought they were too salty.  We waited a while for the Pig's Head, I didn't know it was going to take long, I wished the server would have told us earlier, but it was after the fact, after 30 min of waiting, they gave us fries since we were waiting so long.  That made us happy again!  Fries looked delicious, but I thought it was too salty.  Finally the pig head arrived and it did receive major positive attention from other guests around.  It was probably one of the best pork I've had.. its basically like eating pulled pork.. but I wished they would have gave us some type of bread to go with it, instead of making pork lettuce wraps... I would recommend them giving us some type of min buns, some bbq sauce on the side and that would have made it perfect.  We also ordered drinks, I ordered some girly martini, that tasted awful and my fiance ordered some beer on special.  Yet the beer was a cidar and the server forgot to mention it, and it was also not tasty.  We were very unhappy with our drink selections, clams,.."}
{"text":"Located in the touristy E.4th street by the Indians ball park and quicken loans arena. This tavern has got delicious comfort styled foods.

I went here on a sleepy late afternoon day which just so happened to be happy hour time...Sweet!....and when I walked in I noticed a very laid back vibe with bicycles on the ceiling and everything wood like you would expect walking into a tavern. 

I took a seat at the bar looked through the great drinks menu and met some very cool bartenders and with their recommendation I got the crispy chicken wing confit with roaster jalapeño, lemon juice, scallions, garlic - for people who love garlic and spicy like I do this is amazing and you have to get it heck it is worth coming here just for that!.... and since I was feeling extra glutenous that day I got the no name frites, which is toped with thick cut bacon pieces, fried egg, mustard, mozzarella cheese cheese curd, brown gravy which was fatty and delicious. After I ate all this I needed a nap.

In short:
- Delicious Food
- Friendly Staff
- Great before a sporting event"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about the Brussels sprout appetizer and the bikes on the wall. All my boyfriend talks about us how Ohio beef rains supreme. 

Get the burger and you'll agree that Ohio beef is the queen."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Great, great place... The pig head..... no words... confit wings, very nice. Service? Real people serving with positive attitudes and having fun in a deceivingly rustic but high level culinary environment. Wine was also delicious. Unexpectedly lovely experience. A must stop in the CLE! Didn't expect such good food."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and two friends. I can only say the food was average... everything we had was over seasoned; either with salt, rosemary or some other spice. Service was good on a busy night. Beer menu was overpriced, as was the food. My wife and I spent close to 200 dollars and left unimpressed."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here for date nights, or stopped by after a Cavs game and the food and service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"How this place doesn't get 5 stars consistently is a mystery to me.  Had an amazing breakfast outdoors in the sun with outstanding service.  Food selection (Brunch in our case) was inventive and inspired and the quality and freshness of the ingredients was obvious.  We had a beef burger, veggie burger and hash dish.  Would be happy to eat every meal here if we could.  Tiffany was excellent as our waitress and everyone we interacted with was friendly, professional and skilled.  This is a great spot for interesting dishes and fair prices in an eclectic setting.  Don't miss this one.  There are a ton of choices in the immediate area, but only one other (B&B across the street) that deserves a visit every time you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very excellent experience at this restaurant last Saturday night.  The wings were definitely unique and great.  The Ground Beef Tartar was excellent.  The Pork Chop Saltimbocca was amazing.  They gave me an extra serrated knife to cut it when I could have used a plastic spoon.  One of the most tender cuts of meat I've ever had, it just fell apart, and it was delicious.  Decor was cool with retro hanging bicycles.  Only gripe was it was a bit too dark.  (No pics of the food without flash - and I stopped being that guy a long time ago)  Overall: Awesome."}
{"text":"greenhouse tavern was just OK. the interior design is very beautiful. the service was so-so. we had the tasting menu with goat cheese tart, pommes frittes... i dunno what else i was going to say. started this review back in oct and just getting to it again now. anyway, i'm not that impressed, but i love the concept and the interior is fab. drinks were inspired, too. maybe i'll give it another go!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and I would even give a big nod to the cocktails. The only knock on this place was that the french fries they served were beyond salty.  I was splitting the fries with a friend and my friend agreed. We sent it back and the second batch was only a little less salt.  Don't know what was wrong with the salty fry situation but I would not hesitate to go back here for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor: Order the chicken fingers, but fair warning... Share them with someone you love. The potions are so huge you'll have a challenge fitting that WITH an entree. But oh, so yummy. Devils on horseback are amazing, but teeny portions (yes, I realize it's a small plate). Husband called his food \"Disney World in my mouth.\" Love returning here."}
{"text":"Went here for Restaurant Week with a group of friends, but we ended up ordering off the regular menu for a better variety. I ordered the Very, Very, Very Spicy Greens & Beans as an appetizer and being a spice thrill seeker that I am, I told them to kick it up a notch (Don't do this unless you enjoy spicy food). I must say this is the one place in Cleveland that has been able to match up the food to my spicy cravings. The very spicy greens & beans were exactly how I wanted it and had enough of a kick to make me grab for water by the end!

Now for the main course I had the burger, which was served with pomme frittes. The chef was awesome enough to send over a special spicy sauce he put together for me to use on my burger. Let me just say, it was spicy goodness and my friend made sure she took the leftovers home with her. 

Also if you're looking for something unique to try, this place serves Roasted Pig Head. Two of my friends split this dish and loved it. I'm not a big fan of pork, but if you are, it's a must try! Overall, everyone at the table loved their food and drinks. We were definitely in a food coma by the time we left."}
{"text":"Things I actually said during our dinner there last night. 

\"The House red wine is quite excellent.\"
\"I never realized I could love turnips this much.\" 
\"This is the best salmon I've ever had, ever.\" 
and about the buttered popcorn pot de creme dessert, \" The sea salt changes everything. This is awesome!\""}
{"text":"I'm sure how this \"chef\" is a James Beard award winner as the food was not very good and the service was extremely poor.

We were in town for 1 night and walked over from our hotel after finding it on Yelp.  I don't remember what we ordered but we ordered several dishes to share and none of them were very tasty, below average is what comes to mind.  

Our server came one time to take our order and we never saw her again so we were unable to order more drinks. Too bad for them as we enjoy our cocktails when on vacation and not having to drive."}
{"text":"We have been trying to get to The Greenhouse Tavern for the last two YEARS, but made it here tonight. This restaurant is hyped to the max. It gets great reviews on all types of media. It has a \"world renowned chef\" and they make their own vinegar. So how does it measure up? IT IS BETTER THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT ON EVERY LEVEL!

This is one of the best restaurants in the country, not just Cleveland! 

The chicken wings were excellent. We also ordered the American Fries. This may be one of the best food dishes I have ever eaten in my life. The fries were smothered in cheese curds, brown gravy, pork products, and topped with 2 perfectly cooked sunny side eggs. UNBELIEVABLE TASTE AND HUGE!!!

Our third course was the Fred Flinstone Short Ribs. Not only did it cover the table top with 2 beef short ribs, but it had mashed potatoes topped with turnips and mushrooms. AMAZING!! We took home 2 or 3 POUNDS of meat because we could not finish the short ribs. 

The drink menu is extensive and the wine list offered some really good wines at reasonable prices. Also, Two types of iced tea and a long list of sodas that you will not find elsewhere.

When we finished eating the server asked if we would like to see the dessert menu. I cannot believe that anyone actually orders dessert with the size of the portions. The menu offered some really interesting selections, but we had no room left for dessert.

This restaurant met all of my expectations. The reality far exceeded the hype."}
{"text":"We took our 3 kids for lunch yesterday and it was awesome.  We did tell our kids not to expect bbq wings, chicken nuggets, cheeseburger type of food and they were open to trying new things.  We ordered a little of everything, some we loved and some we will never order again.  The never order again is not b/c it was not great food, just not for us and this is a foodie place.  Every Chicken meal were great, sloppy joe is not for me, meat sandwiches great, salads good but who can mess that up?  Fresh homemade Ginger Ale was a surprise but good.    

Over $100 for 2 adults and 3 kids (and no drinks) is pricey but we say \"first world problems\" and life is short.  Risk it, try new things.  End of the day try every place on East 4th then try more.  Enjoy, happy new year!"}
{"text":"Greenhouse Tavern was our favorite restaurant in Cleveland at one point in time. We feel that our last few experiences have been subpar. Obviously, the wings will always be fantastic, but everything else we have tried recently has been really disappointing. Don't know why things are going downhill, but I hope to see a turnaround."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was bad. I'm 25, living on a budget due to student loans, so finally being able to experience Chef Sawyer's place was exciting. It was a Wednesday night, there were two of us and we made reservations. We sat upstairs, it was actually quite busy. We had one server waiting on all of the tables. I felt bad, you could see he was overwhelmed and had no help. I normally do not write reviews but no matter how good the food is the service makes the meal as well.  I'm full support for Team Sawyer, but don't forget about your staff."}
{"text":"Came here for a couple of post dinner drinks with the work crew. We got a real sense for the place and their focus on sustainability and organics. Beers were rich and potent. Because i briefly glanced at the menu i noticed the pot au feu which i immediately ordered; still full from actual dinner.

The hot broth poured over a layer of tendon and fat to soak the meat and offal below. I don't recall what was contained in it, as there were several items like cheek and other meat but overall the harmonious flavors and richness were a delight to my semi-drunken senses. I savored each spoonful and can only recall a  disappointment in wanting more and not having eaten there to begin with. A surprise that exceeds pleasant and strays into being terrifyingly good."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Best food, and better service! Try the chicken wings confit!"}
{"text":"This was the first time here for a meal. I've been here previously for the rooftop bar which is has an inviting and intimate atmosphere. Was here on a Saturday night with 9p reservations for a party of 2. We got seated outdoors as requested as soon as we arrived. Wine menu was pricey. We ordered two beers and our waiter knew the drink and food menu really well. We ordered the fried brussel sprouts, chicken wings confit and seared lamb to share. My favorite part of the meal was the lamb with mushrooms. The brussel sprouts were over fried... burnt but the flavors were good with the mint and raw onions. The chicken wings I couldve gone without - it was tossed in lemon juice which made it tart, scallions, garlic and jalapeno fried in duck fat. I didn't like the fried and sour combination there. Overall, great service but mediocre food. My recommendation would be to come here for a drink and dip out for food at another location."}
{"text":"Mom came into town and she said she would treat us.  This place gets so much hype we had to go. 

I like the whole concept of the place.  Didn't understand why I couldn't make a reservation at 7 when there was no one in there but whatever.  So if you go early enough on a Friday, there shouldn't really be a wait from what I saw.  

The waiter is worth mentioning.  He was engaging, well versed in the entire menu, even saying he picked the very ingredients from the pasta dish (which changes almost weekly) from the very earth of Ohio in a secret location.  

Started with their chicken wings which were the second best chicken wings I have ever had.  Meat just slides off.  I have never been one to suck on the bone, but I was all up on that bone!  You gotta get these.  

We got the famous gravy fries which are disco fries as far as us east coasters are concerned.  They were great, worth the first timer splurge but I don't know if I would get them again.  The weekly pasta was awesome with a buckwheat noodle.  Hanger steak rare was a little chewy for my liking but didn't regret ordering it.  

Mom ordered a cosmo and it was delish.  They only use natural ingredients in the drinks too so it was sweet and smooth.  They were pushing this organic vodka which was also not a regrettable order.  Mom got drunk and was fascinated with waiters tattoos and went into a whole convo with them about it.  (They are very pro tattoo there.) 

I would go back and try some new things."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go here since I saw the pig's head on Bizarre Foods America. Unfortunately I was by myself on a business trip and it seemed a little excessive for 1 person. Next time.

This place has a cool vibe to it and had a great atmosphere even on a Tuesday. The hostess and servers were very welcoming and were happy to put me at a table as there was no room at the bar.

The menu is one of those where everything sounds amazing so it took me a long time to decide what to have. In the end, I went with the \"crispy\" chicken wings. The inverted comma's are because they are actually soggy chicken wings, not crispy! That's why this place is only getting a 4*.

To be fair, they are still very good and the tangy lemon and garlic juice which makes the wings soggy is mouth-wateringly sharp too. The chicken also slides off the bone and melts in your mouth - even the bones are tender and soft which was weird and I didn't like it when I accidentally bit into one.

I think if I'd have ordered just about anything else on the menu this place would likely be 5*'s as it all looked and smelled delicious. I wish I'd been there with other people so I could have tried some of the other dishes but I won't hesitate to come back here next time I'm in CLE."}
{"text":"1st time there, very disappointed. The wings had so much vinegar on them, they were soggy and sour. The seared duck breast were 3 slices of raw duck. The brussel sprouts were ok, but again were very tart, either with too much lemon or vinegar, so every other bite made your mouth pucker. Service was friendly and prompt, which was a positive. With all the options there on East 4th, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The vegan options are all relegated to cold salad-like options. I like vegan food. I don't want to eat like a rabbit. And no, butter is not a great way to substitute for meat when you're going veg. Not great. Not bad, but overpriced for the food quality. I went twice just to be sure, and yup, underwhelming and salty."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted!  I'm a borderline vegetarian so when my meat-loving husband realized he could get a pig's head, I immediately cringed.  That being said, my review will be from my husband's point of view because the moment the pig's head came to the table, I knew I couldn't eat my pork chop.  I find it amusing they serve vegetarian and vegan meals because I can't really imagine them being able to enjoy those in that environment...  I will say that service was top-notch.  I joked at one point that the server filling the water should just pull up a chair because he came to our table so much.  Our server suggested the pork chop which I got but as you read above, I didn't eat much of it.  We also got the animal style frites which were tasty and my husband loved the whole grain mustard on top.

Anyway...  My husband describes the pig's head as \"tender and bursting with flavor\" and \"it melt in your mouth\".  I cringed when he said the eyeball was the most delicious part of the whole meal and that it melted like warm butter.  Gag, right?  He loved it.  It's his new favorite restaurant but I told him he'll be returning alone."}
{"text":"For starters, we had the blistered shishito peppers, the fois gras steamed clams, and the confit chicken wings - all of which were delicious. I'm a huge fan of the two sections of starters at Greenhouse tavern, and have never been disappointed in a selection. The fois gras steamed clams continue to be an etheral experience, and I find myself spooning that luscious sauce directly into my mouth. :)

Our rating is due to our constant dissatisfaction with the burgers at Greenhouse Tavern. We ordered both the lamb burger and regular burger, and both were cooked to medium well/well even though we had explicitly asked for rare. Unfortunately even if they'd have been cooked properly, they were underseasoned and horribly bland, and disturbingly greasy. I love a juicy burger, but there's a difference between juicy and greasy.

We'll go back for the starters, and perhaps some of the more upscale seasonal dinner offerings, but we continue to be significantly underwhelmed by some of the menu items. I would hope for more consistency overall."}
{"text":"Everything is top notch. Food is very very delicious. Service was excellent. Very cool, unique ambience. I highly recommend eating here. Get the market catch and the fries are some of the best ive had also. Five stars"}
{"text":"I didn't find very many options on the menu that sounded good.
I ordered the hominy as an appetizer and it was very spicy and good.  I would recommend it.
I chose pork chops as my entree and the sauce on top was very heavy.  The chop itself was tender and had alot of fat on it.  I wouldn't order it again.
My friend had clams and enjoyed them.

The ambiance was really nice and our waiter was cool.  But if it weren't for great conversation with an old friend dinner would have been a miss."}
{"text":"Got really ripped off here. Nice rooftop bar, and only good served there is bucket of chicken. F me for not checking the price. Six pieces for $35."}
{"text":"Share the Beef Shin and avoid the strip steak!  This is an eclectic restaurant that serves local food. At first glance the menu is overwhelming with odd combinations of common foods.  The wait staff is very helpful in asking you questions about preferences and guiding you toward a great choice.  For our party of three he recommended that two of the three share the braised beef shin rather than order two.Thank goodness he did! This was about 5 lbs of very slow cooked fork tender meat Au jus. It turned every head in the place when it was brought to our table. It was not salty but was deep in flavor reminiscent of a slow cooked stew beef.  We left with about 3 lbs of it in a bag! Way too much for 2 people.  The animal fries topped with cheese, gravy, fried eggs and spicy mustard were a perfect compliment to this.  One member of our party had the strip steak with pomme frites.  It was flavorful but full of grizzle. Next time, we will all share the shin and avoid the strip! Definitely a place to experience when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hello, best meal of my life.  My foodie boyfriend and myself are going to be apart for the summer so for our last Cleveland meal together we decided to go to Greenhouse.  We've been both dying to try it since we moved to Cleveland so now was the perfect chance.

We made reservations for an early 5:00 dinner on a Friday night.  We arrived early and sat at the bar for a few drinks and an appetizer.  We ordered the bread and butter, which to me was just okay, but I'm also not a butter-lover.  My boyfriend, a butter-fanatic, said it was some of the best butter he's had.

For dinner we were seated at the chef's table.  Amazing,  Best night of my life, no joke.  We both chose to do the 4-course tasting.  I started with the homemade fromage blanc.  Delicious.  mY boyfriend opted for the Pork Pate.  I'm not normally a pate fan, the whole idea grosses me out.  But wow was the this good.  I think the BF was in heaven eating his.

For second, my boyfriend had the Hand Ground Beef Tartare Frites.  He absolutely loved the dish.  I just nibbled a few fries but I can say that they have replaced Michael Symon's fries has my favorite fries on planet earth.  Crunch, thin, flavorful, yum.  Not interested in any of the seconds myself, I asked to swap in a half dish and settled upon the Frisée Side Salad.  A little dollop of goat cheese heaven is hidden beneath the fresh greens.  Delicate and tasty.

It was my main course, however, that blew me away.  I ordered the Half Roasted Chicken in Brioche Bread.  Honestly, I never knew chicken could taste so good.  It was so moist and exploding with flavor.  The brioche bread works magic.  And the bread tastes great, too.  My boyfriend and I are determined to find a way to make it ourselves.  For his main course he had the Whole Roasted Ohio Lamb Crepinette which, surprise, surprise, was out-of-this-world good.  I'm not a fan of lamb, but the dish was delicate and delicious.  

The only disappointment of the evening were the desserts.  My boyfriend ordered the Carmel Milk Chocolate Pot de Crème.  It was the perfect dessert for him because he loves caramel and all things uber-sweet.  I thought it was too sweet.  I tried the Carmel Apple Rum Raisin Crepe and couldn't get past two bites.  Our waitress was kind enough to swap it out for a blueberry tart-type dessert that was a special that evening.  That one wasn't good, either.  Next time I do the 4-course tasting, I'll skip dessert.

One of the best highlights of the night was a free black truffle omelet that the chef offered us at the chef's table.  Holy wow.  If you know anything about fresh black truffles, I don't need to say any more.  If you don't know anything about fresh black truffles, you're missing out.

Our waitress was also amazing and we really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food, ambiance and service is wonderful. Farm to table concept menu with knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff. Draft list is always exciting and has at least one or two brews of Three Floyd's on tap. Three onion truffle risotto was tasty, but a little heavy on the truffle oil. Noise level is quiet-moderate, since I've come on the off peak (early 4:00-5:00p) dinner hours.  Continue to return here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Sadly I wasn't one of the many that rave over this place. 

What I enjoyed was the fact that you get to pick four courses for $44 also known as a prix-fixe menu. Also, the cocktails were very good, especially the one with vodka, lemon soda and an orange.

I started with the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates which only came with three and were very underwhelming. While chocolate and bacon sounds good, it just doesn't taste that great.

Next were the chicken wings, which came with about 10. The meat fell right off the bone which was amazing, but the lime/jalapeno flavor was just not evenly distributed and just didn't mix appropriately.

Luckily, my dinner course was pretty delish. I got the Duck 'n Pumpkin Pasta which was basically ground duck mixed in with a great sweet and spicy sauce with bits of pumpkin in it. I took a risk with this one cause I don't usually eat duck but was pleasantly surprised.

The real treat was the desert. The Caramel Chocolate Pot Au Feu was like heaven in my mouth. Seriously, if you end your meal with this you won't be disappointed.

The girl at the table next to me got sick during her meal, but that's what you get for ordering Steak Tartar. Raw beef and a raw egg never equals a happy stomach if you ask me.

Overall, it was a good experience but I just wasnt as blown away as other people seem to be and I've had much better meals for the price."}
{"text":"I go here every time I'm in Cleveland. It has a great beer selection, good food, and an excellent staff. Plus the patio is great in the spring and summer. Brandon and Alice took care of us last time I was there and they are both excellent people. We actually saw Brandon the next day at the Indians game and he remembered us. Really just a great place and a great group of folks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I didn't have to pay the bill, I'd enjoy this restaurant a lot more.

Yea, yea, I know -- I could say that about any place. But this one seems to fit that statement more than almost any other in Cleveland. 

Two burgers -- perfectly cooked and well seasoned with just the right amount of salt and other mouth-watering dashes of spice (plus the bun was nicely seasoned, something that many burger joints neglect). A decent side of fries. About a dozen chicken wings -- Falling off the bone and \"Chef-ed up\" with lemon juice, scallions, jalapeno and garlic, not simply smothered in a thick reddish-orange sauce.

But why does all of that still have to cost $50? (And those were some of the least expensive items on the menu). 

Nevertheless, the drinks were great -- I had two different unique takes on the Old-Fashioned (who would have thought that Curacao works with Bourbon) and Jeannene had a new spin on the French 75 before trying one of the Old-Fashioneds -- and they were well worth another $50.

Coupled with attentive service and a great patio seating on E. 4th Street, I am happy to give it four stars. But the prices seem to promise a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Summary: Over-priced for very mediocre food.

We had two drinks and shared the teeniest salad you've ever seen and a steak dish.  Even with our fairly minimalist dinner, our check was $75.   If we had gone for any of the tapas-style tasting menu, the check could have quickly been out of control.  Luckily all of the small dishes conflicted with either our allergies or interests.  

The service was slooow and unhelpful.  Our server was very excited, but failed to provide much detail about a specialty drink that was served warm.  He described it as \"drinkable, like drunk juice with a lot of alcohol that you don't taste\" which gave us the impression that it was like a punch...it was basically port, served warm in a wine glass -__-  Not. the right description.  

We asked him if they had a side or house salad and he pointed us to one of the salads on the menu which had to be pretty stripped down to be gluten-free.  The \"salad\" we received was TINY- basically a handful of leaves with very light vinaigrette and one piece of blue cheese.  For $8.   Then we overhead him telling another table that they could sub out a sizable side salad with their meal instead of fries...not sure why he didn't suggest the same for us. 

The rib steak was well-cooked and tender, but sort of dry and overall underwhelming...for $39 we expected more.  The best part of the meal was the seriously delicious potatoes au gratin-style side that came with the steak, but certainly not good enough to justify the price tag.

We saw a couple come in, review the menu and leave- wish we had done the same =/

This place tries pretty hard to be trendy and hip and I guess it's working for them, but we would not be back.  I'm a sucker for farm-fresh, local, eco-friendly, organic and all that happy stuff, but this place is just not a good value."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Good, quality food, unique cocktails, and great service. The crispy chicken wings confit are to die for. If you're feeling brave, try the pigs head. Desserts are delicious too. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A kitschy, charming restaurant in downtown Cleveland with very tasty food. The eclectic decor includes bikes suspended from the ceiling, bookcases lined with VHS tapes, and portraits of piggies. 

Greenhouse is hip and happening, and thankfully the food lives up to the restaurant's coolness. I got the vegan cassoulet, which consisted of white beans, tofu, and a very flavorful tomatoey sauce. It's great to know there are vegetarian/vegan options in a pork-heavy menu. This dish also came with crusty bread for sopping up the sauce. He got the lamb burger, supposedly an award-winning menu item and said the burger, while simply seasoned, was juicy and delicious.

Greenhouse Tavern was probably our favorite dining experience while in Cleveland. Whether visiting from out of town or a local, I'd highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal and people watching."}
{"text":"A small group of friends and I came here during our undergraduate years to celebrate a birthday for lunch and I have to say that none of us were impressed at all.

I ordered the french onion soup to start and it was just way too salty.  I couldn't finish it and after the first couple of bites, I found myself gulping down 2 glasses of water.

I ordered the prime rib sandwich dipped in beef broth and that was very salty as well.  I ended up eating the sandwich by itself and without the broth, it was flavorless and dry.

Sure my first two courses were salty, but surely that cannot apply to the dessert, right?  Wrong!  I forgot what I had ordered, but that was also salty.

Everyone at my table agreed that their meals were too salty as well.  Obviously there was some shady business going on in the kitchen.  I probably ended up consuming close to a pitcher of water by the time I was finished with lunch.  So the good news is that I was pretty full at the end of my meal.  But other than that, it was a very disappointing meal for a fairly expensive price.  I was seriously anticipating Ashton Kutcher coming from the kitchen telling me that we had all been punk'd, but he obviously didn't much to my disappointment (I might have given this review 3 stars if he did).

In the end, this is an experience that my friends and I still laugh about until this day.  But I don't think thats enough of a reason for us to ever go back."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see bad reviews here as we had a great, albeit huge, meal! We decided on the chef's tasting menu which seemed like a good deal but turned out to be too much food, at least for me, my husband finished his.

The first course was a small amuse bouche that was just a spoonful of a melon prepared by the chef.  From there you get to pick a first, a second, a third and either a half of a side or a dessert.  I picked the shinshito peppers as my first while my husband had the heirloom tomato salad.  The peppers were very good but after looking at other tables I wished I had ordered the \"corn bones\" as they looked really, really good.  

For my second I had the gnoochi sardi that was phenomenal and would have been plenty as an entree.  My husband had the brussel sprouts, also good but not entree size.   For our third, I had the lamb burger and was immediately disappointed that I ate all my awesome gnoochi as there was no way I was going to finish the burger.  We got a half of animal style frites which were good but the egg was a bit more cooked than I would have liked plus my gnoochi had an egg on top too which made the second egg a bit much.  

Since we both had the tasting menu we split the one half of the frites and then split a dessert for the other.  I picked the peanut butter crispie.  Good but next time I'll try the popcorn as it also looked good."}
{"text":"Interesting menu.  Be a bit adventurous here.  The flavor combos of their menu items are very good.  Animal fries and ribeye get top marks."}
{"text":"Despite my strange compulsion to call this place \"treehouse bistro,\" this is one of my favorite restaurants.  The burger is one of the best I've had, and if you're very lucky (and can handle a LOT of noise) you can sit at the chef's table.  it's beautiful and consistently excellent.

One caveat--extremely pork-heavy, and it's a good idea if you're avoiding animal fats, say, to check that what you assume is butter isn't, in fact, lard.

That said, I've been here many times and it's always phenomenal."}
{"text":"GRILLED OHIO LAMB BURGER!! Stopped in here for dinner with a small group before a bachelor party downtown. No regrets. A truly exceptional burger from the choice of meat to the way is seasoned. I would have gotten two. Also had a chance to try the crispy chicken wings confit and they were really well executed also. I will return to this gem frequently."}
{"text":"First. The rooftop is only for drinks, so don't be thinking you're going to have dinner up there. We made reservations for two and we were seated at a table that was so close to another table that when I reached my hand over I could lay my palm flat in the middle of the chair next to me. Nobody was seated there so we went along and got drinks. We ordered bacon chocolate dates and the appetizer was tiny for the price. It was one bite per person, and really, it tasted like a chunk of melted chocolate. Before we could order anything else, they sat a couple at the extremely close table next to us. In fact, I think the guy's wife had to rub up against me to get to her seat. It was awkward in a big way since they couldn't even whisper and have a private conversation. Since we didn't want to get raped on price while dining with strangers, we just pain and left."}
{"text":"If you are looking for unique menu options such as a pigs head stop by this restaurant on E4th. When you walk in it's hard to miss the retro decorations including many bicycles hanging from the ceiling. We stopped by before beer fest held at the convention center. We reserved the igloo outside on the patio only offered a few times during the year. I would recommend this experience if you are interested in something new! I had the pork saltimbocca. The pure mashed paired well with the pork three ways. It wasn't served particularly warm but I'm trusting this was a fluke. We used to enjoy the happy hour at the bar which has recently been discontinued. The confit wings are one of our favorite items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, the best food in Cleveland :)  Their drinks are phenomenal as well- be sure to give em a try!"}
{"text":"So freaking good! Food has such a unique flavor, staff is super friendly. And it's in the heart of downtown Cleveland. We came here before the Cavaliers game and ordered 3 appetizers to split- the gnocchi, eggplant meatballs, and fried artichokes. It exceeded our expectations and kept us comfortably full. Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Naples fl, came here last year and had to come back! It is so delicious, maybe one of my favorite restaurants ever. I got the beef tatar last year it was fantastic. This year; crispy brussel sprouts, animal frites, and crispy chick wings confit. Also don't go w out getting the caramel popcorn brûlée"}
{"text":"Good food options to try. Need to try out the chicken wings which go great with any drink. Everyone should try out the crispy pig ears ;)"}
{"text":"Greenhouse Tavern has been the source of some of the best meals I've ever had.  Sadly, that was not the case last night.  Though it was tasty, the portion on the Goat Cheese Morel Raviolini was tiny.  I also ordered the Parisian Gnocchi Brandade Style.  Again, the portion was tiny (more of an appetizer than an entree).  It was also greasy, so much so that I had to send it back.  For desert our party tried the Buttered Popcorn Pot de Crème, the Stoner Sandwich and the Dobos Torte.  The pot de creme was delicious, but the stoner sandwich and the dobos torte were terrible.  We barely touched them.

My love affair with this restaurant is over.  I doubt I'll ever be back.  I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by two Cleveland Natives so it was a must try. 

My first impression was that it was located and this adorable little street, that was closed off for pedestrians and lit up with strings of lights. The ambiance inside was a laid back, cool restaurant/bar with many different floors. The decor was very much old style throw backs but intriguing including the VHS tapes near the entrance. 

We started off with the wings as it was told to us that we HAD to get them. I absolutely loved them, however for my cousin they were a little too spicy as they had something similar to a jalapeno reduction in them. 

For my meal I got the beef burger with a side salad. The burger was cooked perfectly with just enough of a pinkness, but not too red. The salad was the right size and dressed just right."}
{"text":"Very overrated place. OMG I am actually quite shocked how less than uneventful my experience was. 

I visited Cleveland on business and decided to check this joint as it advertised itself as \"earth friendly\" organic, natural food with lots of beer  and wine choices. I am all over it.

I set at the bar and it took a while for someone to recognize my existence. I asked for menu, they took menu from a customer sitting next to me and gave it to me. I asked for a draft beer since I am SD bound beer cruiser ;) they had nothing I liked, tried 3 wines and settled on one \"not very exciting\" chardonnay. It was uneventful and I didn't feel like I was getting a good vibe from the bar crew. The menu didnt sound as interesting either....Since I couldn't order anything I liked to drink I decided to get something small to eat...WHAT A MISTAKE!!! I should have left without ordering anything. 

I got this ridiculously small cabbage salad (size of a tea china cup plate) for $8....OMG....seriously?

Take your money and go somewhere else!!! Customer service was crap, drink, wine and beer menu was uneventful if thats even applicable!"}
{"text":"I ordered the VEGAN BBQ and it was phenomenal!  I've also heard they have the best wings in town and will be in to try those shortly"}
{"text":"After an early afternoon football game, my friend and I stumbled upon The Greenhouse Tavern for late lunch. It felt a little more \"bougie\" in the sense that the menu leaned more on the creative side and was priced higher than most of the restaurants I visited on my trip to Cleveland, but there were plenty of people dressed casually in their sports gear so we decided to settle here.

I settled on a veggie burger (brown rice and black bean) with a small side salad that was tasty but had to eat it with a fork and knife as it fell apart pretty quick. The fries (Pomme Frites) were an additional price. It was presented as more of an appetizer option rather than a side of fries, so the price was higher than most. I liked the infusion of fresh rosemary and made for a different touch.

FYI: My friend and I opted to sit outside during our meal. During our dinner, there were tons of small flies that flew into our drinks and food. I was told by our seat neighbors and waiter that this is a common occurrence in September and October because of Lake Erie."}
{"text":"Our group of 12 ladies stopped at the Greenhouse Tavern this past Saturday for Lunch/drinks.  We were turned away - told that there were too many of us and if we stayed our service would be really slow. - really - who does that?  we went down the street where there were plenty of other restaurants that didn't \"mind\" serving us. 

Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Burgers cooked wronged.. didn't know what was a lamb burger vs beef burger. Sent bucket of chicken out with no plates.. made a poor drink then shoved ingredients in front of friends face! Server was awesome other staff was just unorganized and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great drinks, friendly staff. And you must treat the hard working kitchen staff to a round to see what happens. Do not miss this when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that my boyfriend and I have gone to this restaurant frequently over the years. However, this past week was our last time. We were just here this past Valentine's Day and received excellent service but with sub-par food. We decided to come back because we like the environment. Our server had 2 tables next to us that he was taking care of but completely ignored us and never asked how our food was when it arrived. He only interacted with us TWICE. We ordered the rigatoni and the noodles were cold and very hard. We also ordered the boudin balls and they were dry. The veggie burger was really the only thing that was okay but the salad with it had way too much dressing that tasted like straight vinegar. Funny enough, the manager was standing right next to our table the whole time and never came over to check in. I had to get up and ask him for our check. Ridiculous. He noticed that we were frustrated yet never took the time to ask if everything was ok. It was a complete joke. There are way better restaurants in the area for tourists and Clevelanders to spend their money."}
{"text":"Green House came highly recommended while we were in town, but we were disappointed in the service.  Our food, on a sunday night,  took exceptionally long and not once while waiting for our food, did our server come over and check on us to see if we needed anything until just before our food arrived.  Our entrees - everyone ordered burgers - took an hour. The meal started off on the wrong foot , as we waited for another table to leave from the patio to accommodate our group of 8, while an empty table that could accommodate us sat empty nearby. We finally had to ask if it was an option, and wound up getting seated there, 20 minutes after we were told we were about to be seated.  Presentation of our dishes was also lackluster. Thankfully, food was quite good, but the rest of the experience was frustrating enough we won't return."}
{"text":"Overly priced. Food tastes subpar. I gave the place 2 stars because the waitress was nice. The drinks are expensive and nothing great about them. Eh, I would choose another place to enjoy drinks and dining on e 4th!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool, sort of rugged hipster atmosphere. I love how cozy and casual it is.

To drink I had a spiked hot cider cuz I was freezing, and it definitely warmed me right up. I also tried a drink called Cleveland Roots I believe. Interesting idea and earthy flavor.

I had a whole bunch of dishes with my family: the pork chop was delicious, and I'm a sucker for a good chunk of fat on my meat, so props for that. Carrot tots are a cool idea, tasted fine but could use less salt. Turnips were fine. Fried fish was fine. Chicken wings were fine. Foie gras steamed clams were something interesting.

We had the funnel cake and pile of leaves (I think that's what it's called) for dessert. Funnel cake had a nice, subtle pumpkin flavor. The \"leaves\" dessert wasn't really memorable, although I recall enjoying the candied nuts that were a part of the dish. 

This place has a serious price tag for what you get. You end up spending a good chunk of change for some tiny portions, which isn't really that awesome if the food isn't spectacular. Food was good, but it didn't totally rock my world. Maybe it was an off night? Who knows.

Overall, cool spot, food is a bit of a mixed bag, but go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"So so yummy. This place was perfect for date night! I got the pork chops which came with some delicious mashed potatoes. These were the best pork chops I have had ever. My boyfriend got the steak and fries which was equally delicious. His steak was a little undercooked, but overall a great meal. The wine was great and the restaurant had all around good vibes. Wish it hadn't been raining, the patio seating area looked great!"}
{"text":"First visit was great!  Sat outside (crazy! downtown Cleveland!) on an August night enjoying great Belgian beer and good food.  Went back in November and something changed.  Carn't put my finger on it, but maybe I had certain expectations.  This time had to send back our hamburgers 2x.  $10 for a gin/tonic is steep.  Speaking of steep, the bill for 2 hamburgers and 2 gin/tonics in downtown Cleveland overpriced.  I'd try it again but I think there are other alternatives that aren't chains I'll try."}
{"text":"Strolled down to E. 4th with the wife on a random Monday night and popped in for dinner.  There was no wait, and we were seated promptly at a 2 top up a set of stairs to a balcony that overlooks the restaurant. 

The Great:
I ordered wings as an appetizer.  Phenomenal.  The wings were fall off the bone.  I've never had wings fall off the bone.  Ribs yes, Drumsticks sure, but wings? I never have.  They had great flavor, and fell off the bone.  I had a plate of bones with no chicken on the bone. 

The Good:
Nice beer selection, Nice ambiance

Disappointment:
My wife had a lamb burger that was unbelievably salty.  In the hundreds of times I've gone out to eat with my wife, this was the first time she sent back a dish.  We were thinking they may have inadvertently added too much salt to the lamb meat? The manager did us a solid and didn't charge us for the lamb burger. I had a grass fed beef burger which was also pretty meh.  I'm guessing we just ordered the wrong dishes."}
{"text":"I can't give this more than a 3.  It's okay, but I have no burning desire to return.  The hue of this entire joint is that of recycled paper -- fitting in well with its identity as an environmentally friendly restaurant.  Organic materials garnered from more local, seasonal sources...

The food is all decent, just not impressive, per se.  The beer selection allowed me a Hitachino Sweet Stout.  That's a plus.  I had flank steak which was also passable.

But, aside from seeing the venue from the second level, I have no burning desire to either return or bring another..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have had two completely different experiences at this establishment the first being around a 4.5 star and the second around a 1 star hence the 3 star average. My first experience was great, I dined with two other foodies and we each ordered a different menu item from each category and then tasted each others dishes. The cocktail list definitely needs some tweaking, I actually ended up sending my first drink back because it was pretty gross. (This same fact contributed greatly to my second and worst experience, see below) The Devils on Horseback appetizer was quite delicious despite the fact that I usually do not eat bacon. However my favorite appetizer was the House Made Fromage, it tasted like a cross between goat cheese and cream cheese , I could have licked the plate. The highlight of the meal, without a doubt was the dessert, the Caramel Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme, the mix between sweet from the caramel, salty from the sea salt and the intense chocolate flavor was divine. 

And now for my second, less than desirable experience. My boyfriend and I were craving a great meal but couldn't decide where we wanted to dine, we chose E 4th street figuring something would pique our interest as we walked. We came upon Greenhouse Tavern and given my first great experience, I suggested we eat there. There were no tables available so we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink to see if a table opened in the meantime. We sat at the bar at least 10 minutes with not even an acknowledgment from the bartender. When the bartender finally came over, my boyfriend ordered a vodka and diet while I looked over the drink menu. I was quickly interrupted by the bartender stating, in the rudest tone, that they didn't carry the specific brand of vodka my boyfriend wanted and they didn't carry any sort of diet anything because they do not serve artificial sweeteners in their restaurant. At that point, my boyfriend and I were completely turned off by this blatant display of poor service and decided the leave and dine somewhere else. 

All in all, I really like the concept of this restaurant and given my first positive experience, would give it another try. I'm sure I will probably be back at some point albeit sitting in the dining room as opposed to the bar."}
{"text":"Chicken wings confit is the perfect side. You could eat about 200 of them and not get sick of the FLAVOR! Lamb and beef burgers, along with the homemade ketchup are delicious, and the selection of beers and wine make this a place you need to try. I hope you get Kevin to assist yah and recommend dishes and drinks."}
{"text":"This was one of the most gluttonous meals that I've enjoyed in a while, and keep in mind that I ate one of the tamest things on the menu. To name a bunch, there are dishes like an entire pig's head, foie gras steamed clams, animal fries, savoury donuts filled with coffee and coca cola braised beef & topped with bbq sauce, crispy chicken wings confit, duck meatball soup and Fred Flintstone ribs.

This is a gastropub by a well-known chef, Jonathon Sawyer, who has since opened a bunch more places. The food is basically fat on fat on fat on fat. I definitely got my hit that night.

GRILLED OHIO LAMB BURGER
w/ stinky cheese fondue, champagne shallot, olive-dusted pommes frites & tangy yogurt

The bun is a soft and buttery brioche bun (from local Cleveland bakery \"On the Rise\"), the meat is good quality and cooked medium rare and the fondue and shallots pretty much put the burger over the edge. It was damn incredible and I could barely put this thing down.

The pomme frites are served in a paper cone and are beautifully cut and seasoned. There are bits of garlic, salt, red pepper, rosemary, and a tiny bit of lavender. There is a yogurt dipping sauce on the side.  

BUTTERED POPCORN POT DE CREME
Caramel & sea salt

I knew that I would enjoy this one. I appreciate hot buttered popcorn, including this classic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn_(instrumental), buttered popcorn flavoured Jelly Bellys, and a healthy dose of both pop and corniness. As a tangent on this tangent (just call me scatty chatty Natty), one of my best friends is convinced that liking popcorn is a totally female thing. What a little pop psychologist he is with that kernel of wisdom...

Anyway, enough of this poppycock! Back the review.

The gist of the favour profile is smooth caramel corn, salt and butter from movie popcorn and those special half-popped roasted kernels that you hope to find at the bottom of your bag. Bonkers. Unfortunately, I was stupidly full from my meal and barely got to enjoy it, but I can see why patrons won't let the executive pastry chef take this one off of the menu. As a dessert side note, other people in our group enjoyed the funnel cake with goat milk ricotta."}
{"text":"The hype is real!  

I've been here four or five times, and never felt bothered to review it due to the sheer volume of reviews already submitted.  Echoing what others have said, what do I have to add?  LeBron James is good at basketball, Austin Texas is hip, there's a drought in California, and the Greenhouse Tavern makes good food, yada yada.  

But, browsing recent reviews and seeing a flurry of whiny accusations of overratedness and angry 1-star tantrums over a single bad experience, I feel the need to say something.

As a said, I've been here four of five times, and sure, there was an off night sandwiched in those visits, and a few items that missed their mark.  But please - to condemn an establishment based on an occasional shortcoming reminds me of the American who spends two nights in Paris on a guided tour, and then announces to his or her friends at home that the entire country of France sucks and that the French are awful.  The Greenhouse is Paris; it has a great reputation that is well-earned, but remember that Paris still has ghettos, mean people, traffic and bad food.

Anyway, here's my schtick: there's a bar on the right when you walk in that is staffed by very knowledgable bar people who execute their drinks perfectly, and seem proud to be working on the cutting edge of gastronomic culture.   They will talk the Cleveland food scene with you, tell you what to order, and tell you where to go next.  You'll get everything you need here in the bar;  don't bother with the restaurant part, and certainly don't book your 20-person birthday party here.  The finer things in life are enjoyed in small, intimate, concentrated doses.

The food is all about the wings; everything else flows from there.   Simply describing them as \"the best chicken wings ever\" won't do. To give you a better idea, they are good because they undergo a slow, low-temp oven-roast that allows the wings to cook in their own rendered fat.  This \"confit\" method is almost always though of as a duck thing, but as a chicken thing, it shines and delights.   There is no sauciness about the wings, either.  That would take too much attention away from the perfectly cooked meat.  Instead they are tossed in a little lime juice, fresh cilantro, and minced garlic (I think), to add a fresh and tangy accent.  These wings are so succulent and thoroughly roasted that you can actually eat the bones.  

Lobster in Maine, salmon in Seattle, barbecue in Memphis, confit wings in Cleveland.  That's the territory you are entering into here.  Ride this wing high into the rest of the menu, and let me know what else you find; I haven't gotten that far very often."}
{"text":"I love this place---Upscale food and cocktails without the pretentiousness. Even the simplest of menu items, like chicken wings, are amazing and will not disappoint.

While I have been here on several occasions and all experiences were positive, the Metal as F#ck dinner on March 15 stands out above all---a true feast for your senses---eyes, ears and of course, taste. No detail was left to chance, and the restaurant was completely transformed into a \"dark\" place, fitting for the music and meal to come.  

The 6-course menu aptly named \"A Feast of Destruction\" accompanied by the elective \"Potions and Libations\" option were delectable and a perfect pairing as intended. An added treat was seeing the \"Lamb of God\" hoisted above Chef's shoulders and proudly paraded around the restaurant for all to see prior to it becoming our main course. A photo worthy moment that prompted dialogue with others in attendance, which leads me to another positive, the patrons.

By the end patrons were hanging out with each other, enjoying music, cocktails and conversation. It felt as though a group of closest friends gathered for the evening.  

Kudos to Jonathon and his team for going all out to make this a truly unique experience."}
{"text":"We went there on a week night to celebrate my bf's birthday. If you are willing to pay the $$$ you will definitely get some unforgettable food!

Their most expensive item on the menu that night was a Age Steak (I believe it was 40 day aged). After our friend ordered it, I tried a bit, and it was absolutely incredible!!! According to him, it was money well paid for. 

Another dish was their roasted chicken, which the menu claims to be the best chicken in Cleveland. Once again, it was up to our standard. Although it was mostly white mean, but this is the most flavorful white meat I've ever tried! The meat was cooked just right..unlike most of the restaurants where white meat turns into dry chicken jerky half of the time.

My bf ordered the pig's head. You may not believe me but the dish was literally half of a pig's head! OMG...well don't order it if you think you'll be scared looking at it. But it was such an incredible dish!!! Cooked to perfection and a decent amount of fatty meat. If you like fatty meat, this is the one to get. For normal people, it's pretty much enough to feed two. 

I ordered the chicken fried lamb steak (I believe that was the name). It was also very amazing. Cheaper than all the other dish listed above, but I believe it was definitely worth the money I paid for. This is one of their newest item on the menu. but it didn't disappoint me. It came with a side salad which was pretty refreshing with the lamb. Since it's the first time I've ever had Friend lamb..it was great.

Our waiter was also very helpful that night. Although the menu had a lot of words that you many not understand, he was willing to explain to you what each item was. 
Overall, I think it was a great meal and the right place to go for my bf's birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Love this place, my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  

Favorite items 

* Pig's Head - Tastes like fattier pulled pork, amazing.  Easily feeds two people.  
* Popcorn Pot De Creme - As amazing as it sounds

They also have a cheaper happy hour menu for late night and eating at the bar which is very good.  WIth $2 beer!"}
{"text":"Really gone downhill. Portion sizes smaller and prices higher. Hostess was nasty - even with a reservation-- and called a manager over to scold us for switching to another table. Be awhile before we go back again. With so much competition on E 4th, you have to be exceptional and greenhouse can't sustain this with just unusual items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I went here with 7 of my friends for my girlfriend's birthday. This restaurant takes itself way too seriously and is definitely not in the same ballpark as its competitors. I ordered the infamous roasted pig head for $45, and it was about 1/4 lbs meat and 2 lbs of fat - Definitely not worth it.  My girlfriend ordered their risotto for $32, which was just arborio rice, cheese, and 3 shavings of truffle. The rest of the party ordered the Properly Butchered Rib Steak (comparable to a Longhorn steak) , rice and bean burger (was a weird tint of orange - my friend couldn't even eat it), pommel frites (apparently, it's fancier if the garlic is tossed in with their skins still in tact), and Ohio beef burger (no better than any bar burger). 

Bottom Line - This place is overpriced and the food isn't even good. I recommend you go to Lola or Red instead."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on business, and The Greenhouse Tavern was recommended by an acquaintance who used to live there. A reservation on a Tuesday night was no issue, and the restaurant was busy but not crowded. The ambience and decor are great, and the staff is the typical young hipster-ish type (and I don't use that term negatively).

Both me and my co-worker went with the 5 course tasting menu. The great part about his is there are no restrictions, you can choose one thing from each of the menu sections. There's an up-charge for the more expensive items, but that's expected.

Overall, I found several dishes to be very heavy on the salt, to a point of an actual uncomfortable feeling in the mouth. That aside, the dishes were very good and well prepared.

My co-worker ordered as his third course the beef short ribs. As this was part of a tasting menu, we expected tasting portions. However, the short ribs were anything but short. He received two ribs that were each at least 12 inches long and had tons of meat on them. It was delicious, but it was enough food for a full meal, and maybe more. Why they feel that is appropriate as part of a tasting menu is beyond me. Much had to go to waste, as it just wasn't possible to eat it all.

Overall, I was happy with our experience, and I would recommend those passing through Cleveland to give it a try, but I don't think I would go back if given the chance."}
{"text":"The lamb burger was outstanding! Brennan, my bartender was awesome and very knowledgeable. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. I love that they are super green and locally sourced. You should totally check it out."}
{"text":"My beau and I came here for an early valentine's day dinner, and we had a really great time. 

First of all, I love the concept of Greenhouse. They try to do everything sustainably and they don't really make a lot of noise about it -- they just practice it and that speaks for itself. I like how they butcher their own meat, and then they make sure to use every part of it, including the head (see below) and \"fifth quarter\", which when they take the extra parts and make it into a 2nd course dish.

When we walked in, we immediately saw two guys sitting at the bar with a large silver plate of meat. My b almost drooled and exclaimed, what is that?! Turns out it was a pig's head, which is one of the menu items. It looked really delicious!

He ended up ordering one of the 3rds, and I had the tasting menu. Here's our rundown:

1st course - fried smelt with thousand island dressing -- 3.5 because I enjoyed it and it was super tasty, but it wasn't too special (I've had it a lot at japanese restaurants)

2nd course - stuffed cabbage (vegetarian) -- 3.5 because I really, really liked the flavor of the vegetables and the cabbage rolls, but it was hard to cut into pieces to eat without just breaking it apart. I don't eat meat anymore, and I have to say that while the rice pilaf was delicious, it just has such a different texture/consistency from meat. Everything kept falling apart.

3rd course - mushroom and oxtail risotto with poached egg -- 4 oh MMMM. This was delish. I love the mushroom, umami flavor with the tender oxtail! (Though I gave most of it to my b.) Breaking open the poached egg and mixing it with the risotto was wonderful. I have to say that it was a little on the salty side, and it was quite heavy, so I didn't get a chance to finish it. I saved the rest for leftovers.

Halfs - local radishes and turnips -- 4 because I was craving veggies, and they were done well!

My b got the 1/2 chicken, which was baked into a brioche bread. I have to say, seeing it presented piqued my curiosity! I think he liked it overall (juicy and not dry) but would give it a 3.5. He has really high standards for roasted chicken! 

The decor was also really pleasant. It was modern rustic with distressed furniture and rich wood planks on the walls. They also had vintage bikes hanging as art displays. There's a large open area that leads up to the 2nd floor as well.

We had a good time, and hopefully we'll be back to hang out on the rooftop."}
{"text":"Love love love! A bit quirky and so fun.  The pom frets are amazing!!!! They have a good craft beer selection.  I have eaten here a few times and I am never disappointed"}
{"text":"I love how many vegetarian and vegan options this restaurant has. They are creative and very fun. But for my third visit here, I came away satisfied but overall disappointed.  On my first visit years ago, not long after it opened, I had the tastiest gnocci I've ever had. This time the food was just fine, and under delivered on its promises.

The kale salad with cheese and lemon was nicely chewy, but the citrus was overwhelming.  The veggie burger was seasoned nicely but mushy. The salad was limp.  

The outdoor seating was wonderful but the staff was way too pushy when it came to clearing out plates.  Yes it was a Saturday night but we had to keep shooing them away from our clearly in-progress plates.

You know what? I would still come back to this place if the menu changes. I love how adventurous Chef Sawyer is, and I appreciate his attention to vegetarian/vegan food. I just hope he's in the kitchen the night I return."}
{"text":"I was here with a party of 10 which is normally no problem.  I asked for a bottle of wine and the waitress said 'we don't have that' and just looked at me rather than help me pick another one close.  I asked for another bottle, 'we don't have that' again, not helping with choose or pick another bottle.  I ordered the steak or maybe I should say half fat half steak.  I had to ask twice before my fries showed up.  We all got the wings and there were ZERO garlic shallots and were about 100x hotter than usual.  I have been going to GH since it opened and I can tell you the service has gone down considerably.  Chef Sawyer seems too busy with other projects and letting his Crown Jewel rot.  No biggie, there are way too many other restaurants in the area.  Lastly, waitress tacked on 20% even though we split the bills up.  I always thought it was 18% and she only deserved 8%.  

Won't be going to GH anymore.

Shame!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. But food was ok, everything we ordered was inconsistent, hit or miss. Ordered 2 starters (small bites) and 2 appetizers (2nds - bigger bites). From Starters - Cauliflower salad was great, baby beets was just average. From appetizers - quail was great, stuffed cabbage was disgusting, we sent it back (I would take that off the menu), ordered beef tartar instead - it was average. Told the server that we were celebrating a my wife's birthday, but wasn't even acknowledged for it (sometimes small things can make a big difference). My wife wasn't crazy about dessert menu and due to inconsistency of the food decided to go somewhere else for dessert. Great atmosphere, great patio, but I don't know if I would come back again."}
{"text":"We've been talking about trying The Greenhouse Tavern for a very long time and finally made it there.  Since it was during Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week we thought we'd take advantage of that.  If you're not familiar with Restaurant Week, it is a ten day period where restaurants offer a fixed menu (three courses and you usually have two or three choices per course) for a fixed price, either $30 or $40.  Some restaurants also offer a lunch menu. It's a great way to try a place that you might not otherwise afford.  

My husband ended up ordering off the fixed menu and he had the crispy chicken wings for his appetizer, short ribs for the entree and pot de creme for dessert for $40.  I ended up ordering off the regular menu and had a strip steak.  We both loved our food, especially the crispy chicken wings (I made my husband share one with me!).  My steak was very good and came with rosemary french fries that were full of flavor. 

Our server was very nice and our water was always refilled quickly, something I appreciated since that was what I was drinking for dinner.  The restaurant is eclectically decorated and is lots of fun.

Here's the negatives.  We sat on the mezzanine level which was nice.  The downside is to route you need to take to get to this level is pretty out of the way.  That would be fine except that the area you go through and the stairwell is pretty dirty.  If your guests need to pass through this area then at least clean it up a bit.  There were some signs around that said \"Pardon Our Dust\" which is understandable if there is construction but I didn't see construction, just a dirty area. 

Also, my husband's short rib entree came on a salad plate.  A salad plate!  Especially compared to my steak and french fries, his entree looked more like an appetizer rather than an entree.  For $40 (for the three courses) they could at least put the short ribs on a dinner plate with a few garnishes.  

I'm not sure if we will return to The Greenhouse Tavern.  There are so many other wonderful restaurant choices in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to greenhouse a number of times, and I have yet to be disappointed. They always seat you at the time of your reservation, and the servers are always helpful and honest. My suggestions:

- split the Fred Flintstone short rib and take the leftovers for the next day
- popcorn pot du creme for dessert... There's a reason why this dish has gotten national attention
- kitchen coffee. Awesome experience and thank that kitchen for providing a solid meal
- chicken wings. If nothing else, just grab these for a quick late night snack. Always a win!"}
{"text":"I had to ask for Salt.... Maybe my expectations were too high and I definitely ordered the wrong dish. But I assumed if you order from a James Beard awardee anything  you serve on you menu would be delicious. I wanted a lite lunch so ordered the lake pike which was bland bland bland and not seasoned properly. Even the squash bedding was flavorless. 

The ambiance was cool and I gave this place 3 stars for that but my dish was at best 1.5 stars. If it's not good don't put it on the menu. I should have ordered the meat which I'm sure would have been prepared well. Disappointing...."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was amazing!   Every plate was crisp and clean and bursting with flavor!"}
{"text":"A Thursday night touchdown in Cleveland was marked by familiar weather: cold and rainy.  I made made my way through the rain in my big Chevy Impala to my downtown hotel.  The local time was getting late, but I wasn't in a rush for food as it was still 6pm by my body's pacific time clock.  I put away some things then pulled out my laptop to check trusty ole Yelp for local eateries.  I came across GHT with its 4+ stars and some great commentary on wings and smallplates, which would be perfect as I wasn't too hungry. It was also only a couple blocks away, so I walked on over there.  Sadly, it was not to be.  I must have spent more time than I thought getting ready and they appeared to be getting ready to close.  I figured I would have some time to hit it up later in the weekend and headed home.

Fast forward to the end of the long weekend, and it is Sunday with a 7:30 flight and GHT opens at 4pm.  One of the friends I met up with that weekend went on and on about how great the place was, so I knew I had to go.  4pm supper it was, then!

After spending some time scrambling for parking (there must be some better parking in the area, but I don't know where it is), I rolled in at about 4:10.  Being alone, I opted to sit at the bar.  There were only a couple tables and about three other people at the very long bar this early in the afternoon.  However, by the time I left at around 5:30pm, the place had started fill to about 3/4 full.

The problem with GHT is that everything looks good, and they have a great selection of wine by the glass.  They also have a good selection of eclectic beers, but I'm not a beer with food pairing person.  I wanted to order about 5 things, at least one of them a main course.  However, I chose the duck crackling pasta and the foie gras clams.  Perhaps this was a bit too rich, but I wasn't hungry enough for the pork chop, which is what I really wanted, and stuffing myself prior to a flight seemed like a bad idea.  To go with the food, I chose a nice pinot noir from Oregon, and it was so good, I went ahead and had a second glass to enjoy while finishing up some of the sauce with leftover bread and reading my book.

It is difficult to describe, but GHT just feels comfortable.  Maybe it was some combination of the friendly service, the low-key atmosphere shortly after opening time on a Sunday, and sitting at the bar but I wanted to just hang out with another food item and glass of wine.  There are a couple TVs in the place, most notably a large one over the bar.  I do not understand why every place feels it needs a TV on the wall; at best it is distracting and at worst during an exciting game it can be really annoying.  

There is also a large party seating downstairs and some tables upstairs, which makes for nice variety."}
{"text":"The dinner items were great when we went. I tried a few different plates and all were delicious. A friend called the properly butchered rib steak the best steak he's ever had. The Pork Chop Saltimbocca was also a meal worth indulging in.

The best things I've had, as long as you're not on a diet, are the chicken wings, the gravy frites and the animal style frites.

We came back for lunch a few weeks later and that was a little more hit-or-miss. I got the short rib sandwich, which I probably wouldn't get again, and a friend ordered a pasta dish that had to be re-fired because the noodles were under cooked.

tl:dr This is my favorite dinner place I've found in the city but I'd go somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"Looking for a restaurant with good food and interesting character? Greenhouse Tavern is your place! I've been here a few times now, and I've never been disappointed! The menu is quite unique. It's divided into \"Firsts\", \"Seconds\", and \"Thirds\", which roughly translates to appetizers, small plates, and entrees. In the Firsts section, I've tried the Trios Mec Pomme. This was an interesting dish... the potato skins are smaller than bite size, so it was really difficult to eat it. Otherwise, the flavor was great! In the Seconds section, I've tried the crispy chicken wings confit, barrel aged tabassco fried chicken, and pork tonkatsu ramen. The crispy chicken wings are my favorite of the three. It was perfectly seasoned with salt, lime and garlic. I was not a big fan of the fried chicken. There was too much flour and too little chicken. Also not very crispy. The pork ramen is pretty good, but for the portion size, it's not really worth your money!  And for Thirds, I've had the Ohio lamb burger. SUPER delicious!! The lamb was well cooked and paired amazingly with the cheese. The buns were also perfectly fluffy. It comes with a huge side of homemade potato chips. 

I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago for dinner. Having been here once before closer to their opening date, I had a great experience then (maybe 3 years ago). This time it was a different story completely. First, the service was slow and disorganized. Entrees came out at different times and multiple items were forgotten. Secondly, the food was just not good. Out of the 4 meals, only one was good. I had the lamb burger (minus the bun) and it was dry and flavorless. Another entree was the pork chop and it was so small it was comical. A third entree was the fish of the day. Interestingly the burger came with two sides and the seafood came with none. It was odd, just a tiny filet of fish and nothing else. I would expect that at a fancy steakhouse maybe, but this is a casual Warehouse style establishment. The 4th entree was the strip steak and it was quite good. This place is supposed to be the best place in town (according to many) but I'm just wondering if they're resting on their laurels a bit."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for a wedding and to meet up with my sister for dinner and drinks.  My husband and I found this little place on 4th street based on yelp reviews.  We made reservations for outside on the patio and was told about a 30 minute wait (on a Wednesday).  We went to the roof deck for drinks and waited...for over an hour.  The drinks are just OK.  I asked for a Moscow mule and was served it in a glass (but they have copper mugs).  That was disappointing (note to self, ask for the mug!).  

When we finally got seated, the service was good, our waitress was friendly and suggested after dinner desert ideas.  The food was very good, we had the beef short ribs, which served all four of us!  We also had the chicken bucket, which was very good.  I recommend both of these dishes.  

Overall a cute place with a roof deck, I'd recommend it for a night out.  Note that there is indoor seating, we just wanted to enjoy the outdoors on such a beautiful night."}
{"text":"We ate here last night while visiting Cleveland. The bread spread was amazing! The rest of the food was delectable as well. The only complaint is that their margarita was not very good. I'm probably too partial to Texas margaritas, so I shouldn't have gotten one in the Midwest! Otherwise, everything was great!"}
{"text":"I was told i was \"fancy\" for coming here so im writing this review with my pinky extended *giggles*.

I sat at the bar, it was a packed lunch crowd, but the bar was nice and long , plenty of seating and the bartenders took orders for us. its very \"taverny\" inside, they have bikes hanging inside, a wall of VHS (yes VHS) tapes from my childhood, awesome nostalgia ambience inside. Its a big small inside, they do have a second floor but i didnt go upstairs so my review is strictly on the downstairs. Beautifully crafted wooded stools.

Their wings are definitely on my \"best of cleveland\" listing, like crispy outside, moist (yes i said moist) inside tender meat tossed in the perfect sauce! The walking tacos were awesome as well although the fried egg threw me off.

I had their wild mushroom pasta, the pasta was a bit undercooked for me but it was all in all a great dish. The shitake was fresh, almost like freshly picked, the sauce was light and rich of flavor.

 I can see why i was indeed called fancy, the price was way too high. Drinks and our meal came to about $200 for 3 people which for the ambience and amount of food wasnt ideal for me esp when it was supposed to be a quick \"light\" lunch lol. I will be back for dinner thougH!"}
{"text":"So crazy good. The place - all around excellent. The ambiance is fantastic - great surroundings. The food? Beyond: delicious. Fresh, flavors, ridiculous. We try to go to new places, but have to keep coming back here because we hate to risk it."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a late-ish dinner on a Monday night and enjoyed it immensely. We started with the crispy confit wings and the Tabasco fried chicken--unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find either of the dishes to be particularly small. There were maybe 20 wings on the plate and two enormous pieces of fried chicken--a leg and a thigh. I preferred the fried chicken, which was juicy and pleasantly spicy.

We split the pig head. Normally I'm squeamish about eating something that still looks like an animal (blame my sanitized Millennial upbringing) but it was absolutely fantastic! The meat was juicy and tender, and the \"bark\" of the pig was sweet like candy. Even a temporary unsettling moment that occurred as my brother picked up the jawbone with the teeth and held it up to his own face didn't stop me from plowing through it. I also tried the Alsatian risotto and it was AMAZING--the squash pickles were a perfect foil for the rich risotto.

Service could have been a little better--the waitstaff seemed a little flustered throughout the entire meal, though not necessarily unfriendly--but otherwise Greenhouse Tavern is an awesome spot in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Expensive food, small portions, bland taste. I was not impressed and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This isn't just a restaurant, it's an experience. I'm talking life changing food. From Sawyer to Dankon it's a meal that is hard to find fault in. The tasting menu is a must. The confit wings on the seconds menu are a food that you will have dreams about for months to come."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I love the food.  I usually love the service too.  This last time was a little bit less than the typical quality, although nothing was really terrible- just a few glitches.  First of all, the hostess cancelled my reservation since I decided to sit at the bar instead of a table (I like to get my open table points!)  I asked her to un-cancel it, which she did, so I appreciated that.  

Second, there were three beers on tap, none of which I was familiar with.  I asked the bartender about them.  One was a peche sour.  Ix-nay on that.  I don't like sours.  Next one was \"I think maybe an IPA, but I'm not sure?\" (That was the bartender's answer).  He tried to figure it out and ended up just telling me \"I really don't know.\"  So I went with the third one, an ale, which he wasn't quite sure about either.  It tasted like Bud Light or some other crappy beer.  I didn't like it.  He didn't check back to see, so I drank just half of it and left the rest.  I kinda shrugged it off and just enjoyed the food and ice water. 

Third thing: they no longer have a happy hour menu, although it is widely advertised on the website.  I had my heart set on several items and I was there at a weird hour, when there were physically about 5 other people total in the whole restaurant.  So that was mildly disappointing too.

I liked what I did have: poutine (they don't call it that, but they were fries covered in gravy and cheese curds) and the wings, which were pretty flavorful.  

Other times I've been here, I've been blown away.  So this is really less than a 4 with this last visit, but rounded it up, based on my previous visits of the stellar service and delectable food."}
{"text":"With all the rave about the wings, I had to try them. Confit wings? Interesting.... They're juicy but not crispy enough for my liking. I do like the garlic and scallions, has a nice kick. Also a generous portion of wings for $9. Overall good but certainly not the \"best wings ever\"

Meanwhile, in veggie land... The Lettuce kale salad was beyond disappointing. Basically a regular garden salad for $9. Cross that one off the menu."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary eve here and we did the chef's tasting. Everything we tried was amazing!"}
{"text":"So, so good. Got the Chef's tasting menu. A good deal at $44. Tried the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates for my small plate and the beef tatrtare for my app and loved both. Would not have the strip steak entree again as it was just ok and the other entrees coming out of the kitchen looked awesome. The johnnycake dessert was a scrumptious salty-sweet treat. Went for work and definitely headed back with the hubby."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurants.  Had the Confit chicken wings appetizer that were fall-off-the-bone!  My sister had the New York Strip with what seemed like an awesome balaamic glaze reduction.  I had the Lamb burger with the pom frites wich were excellent.  My sister's friend had a very moist meat loaf.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I was just so disappointed in my food. I wanted to give this place a second chance because I love Jonathan's food and concept.  When I ate here the first time on a previous trip I wasn't overwhelmed with my meal. This time was even worse...I think the dishes must not be consistent in their preparation, because others liked the same dishes that I couldn't even eat. My crispy chicken wings were not crispy at all; they were so soggy and had flecks of red blood near the bone...Bad.. The lemon flavor was just way too over powering; I had no jalapenos, only a couple raw chunks of garlic and scallions. For me they were the worst wings ever... We also had the gnocchi which had lots of  crunchy pieces of  raw garlic in the sauce...Really? 
 The rose wine was  YUK ....So even my wine was the worst!  Will I go back? Probably, because I have to try to have a good meal at this place. I ate at another of his restaurants this trip  and the food was really outstanding. So...hoping for a better meal next time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came for brunch and it was absolutely awesome! All of our dishes were great but the best by far was the waffle with Mitchell's pistachio ice cream. The bacon was also great as was the corned beef hash, and the sausage gravy pasta. Couldn't ask for more. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Their cocktails aren't that great. But other than that REALLY good stuff! Get the wings! Great beer selection. Bacon wrapped dates are great too. Very intimate and cozy."}
{"text":"Service staff was friendly and excited about the menu. Too bad the food did not measure up to the enthusiasm. The food went from bland to over salted. Chicken wings were good though and saved us from leaving Hungary."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot, great food, great decor, good beer list too.
Specializes in meat dishes, small appetizers too, in summer sit on the patio, btw, it's next to the house of blues on 4th"}
{"text":"I've only had drinks here at the rooftop bar and inside. The food menu seems a little expensive, but you can't beat the views from the roof."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! HOWEVER! What's keeping it from 5 stars was a girl with a cheek piercing and a leopard tattoo. As soon as we got there and told her we had a reservation she was instantly annoyed. I then asked if we could sit outside on this beautiful day and the first table she took us to (past the empty table) had a man already sitting at it, but she still asked if we wanted to sit there still. Then I asked what about the empty table behind us and she said that was for 6 people. I said I wasn't sure how many were coming since I didn't make the reservation so she then asked me to call the person that made it to find out for sure. Finally another employee knocked some sense into her and said we could sit there and the rest of the experience was great! If it wasn't for the fact that we were meeting friends for drinks and dinner who had been there before we would've left in the first 2 minutes. She needs a lesson in hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night- amazing!!  Very cool place. I had the Strip Steak Frites and my husband had the Pork Chops. SO good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Greenhouse twice now and I have to say, the love affair is over.  Don't get me wrong.  There are way worse places in Cleveland at which to eat.  And Greenhouse gets major props for being committed to using local foods/ingredients whenever possible.  Although, what's the deal with a restaurant that's committed to local foods but can't seem to find a local wine to save its life?  I just feel like the whole place is way overrated.  If you're looking to immerse yourself in the local food scene, you'll have a much better time at Crop Bistro .  The food is good enough, but not inventive or interesting.  The ambiance is like anything you can get at any other restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to GHT frequently and always have a hard time between ordering our favorites and trying everything new.  The chicken wings are succulent with the perfect amount of spice. Sometime we order them with ghost pepper sauce which hurts in a good way. The pot du creme is a perfect bite of dessert. My sister tried it with us once and she started actually crying of joy. We always really like the servers there too. Particularly, Kevin. He is always really interested in the food and his enthusiasm for the place shows. Plus whenever my husband brings me food to go if he's out and I'm not, Kevin will write funny notes on the takeout boxes."}
{"text":"Très bonne surprise pour ce restaurant en plein cur de East 4th le quartier touristique de Cleveland . J'avais pris des clams avec une sauce aux foies gras et oignons rouges un délice mon mari un steak tartare revisité excellent avec des pommes frites maison à l'ail et romarin. 
Les desserts valent le coup aussi. Les serveurs sont au top et la décoration ambiance ferme du middle-west  est trop sympa."}
{"text":"As one who eats mostly vegetarian but sometimes has fish, the GHT has been a difficult place for me to find something to order. Once they were out of the vegetarian dish that I was eager to try. Another time I ordered a buckwheat gnocchi that was unattractive (think little turds...sorry!) but had such a complex and interesting flavor profile and rich texture. I do see how this place would appeal to meat eaters, but vegetarians may or may not feel the love...so perhaps try it out when you aren't starving?"}
{"text":"Greenhouse Tavern was one of the best experiences me and my boyfriend have had downtown yet. Since moving downtown we really haven't dined and wined but seriously this place takes the cake!!

Jay, a server is absolutely fabulous! Thanks to him it was great!

Did the 4 course meal which was worth it!"}
{"text":"An outstanding meal. We sat downstairs at the chef's table & we were so happy that we did. 

To start, we split an order of the chicken wings confit and the gravy fries. The chicken wings were cooked to perfection, literally fall off the bone. The gravy on the fries was sweeter than expected but still delicious. 

For entrees we ordered the rigatoni & bistro steak. Both were well executed and the steak was cooked a perfect medium. 

Although we were stuffed, I couldn't leave without trying the buttered popcorn creme brûlée. I'm not huge on sweets and I ate every bite! The mix of salted caramel and creme was the perfect mix. 

Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Greenhouse for some time  - and had my opportunity last evening.  We went to Guys and Dolls at the Hana Theater, then dinner at Greenhouse.  The wait staff was absolutely spot on - what a wonderful start.  The Devils on Horseback and the Asparagus appetizers were outstanding.  Well prepared and fantastic - unfortunately, that is where the meal went sideways.  We ordered the Lamb burgers with a side of fries.  The burger was served on the nicest, and one of the best buns, but over salting ruined the burger.  The salt carried over to the fries - again, over salted and nearly unable to be eaten.

I can eat most any food, and sending the burger and fries back crossed my mind several times.  I left most of the fries and over half of the burger on my plate (but ate the bun) - I did not need the headache and confrontation of retuning it to the kitchen.  I left the restaurant unhappy - and probably will not return.

The two stars that I almost gave the restaurant - great people, good start and a nice wine list - over salting, heavily over salting, is a rooky mistake and at the price, not one that I would care to try again with so many other possible alternative restaurants near.  

Both meals were an over salted disaster, we had dessert down the street to help wash out the taste and salvage what started as a great meal."}
{"text":"Didn't really live up to the hype. Gravy frites were good but there's nothing new and amazing about French fries covered in gravy. The chicken wings were probably the best thing we ate and looking back we should have just ordered a couple baskets of that and walked out happy. Instead we tried the Pig's Head ($58) and Flintstone Short Ribs ($52). Pig's head took an hour which we were told ahead of time. It was massive, but quantity does not equal quality. This was especially true for the Flintstone Short Ribs. I am fully aware that short ribs are fattier than baby back ribs, but this was ridiculous. Three massive ribs and the most meat I got from the first one was maybe, maybe, maybe half the rib. The other two were eaten as leftovers the next day and I probably got about 8 good bites of meat out of the two remaining ribs. What a joke. Just mounds and mounds of fat."}
{"text":"Located in a great area between many other restaurants. You can opt to sit inside or outside if the weather permits.

I came with a friend for Sunday brunch. We both ordered the corned beef hash breakfast which came with a piece of toasted baguette. The flavors were wonderful and we both enjoyed it.

Our waitress ( I can't remember her name) was friendly and helpful. I would return again and actually look forward to going again for brunch."}
{"text":"Incredible meal and service.  Arranged a chef's table dinner for 12. No set menu, food is prepared on the \"chef's whim\". Seated downstairs next to the kitchen. Had a few people with food restrictions that we informed the staff prior to visiting.  Chef accommodated these restrictions with ease.  Every course was wonderful, delicious and original.  Some really inventive dishes which the chef explained prior to each course.  Had two great attentive servers who took care of everything.  Chef surprised us with an extra course of a dish he has been working on and was not on the menu.  Just a great memorable meal.  We were entertaining some out of town guests for a meeting and they raved about the food and service.  Again a great experience."}
{"text":"the first restaurant in our \"farm to table\" theme road trip last month. and it set the bar very high right off the bat! we came here for lunch and loved the location with a nearby valet parking available. the street is a true patio seating with no auto traffic - something a country as vast as the US has somehow skipped on.
Ok now the food chosen purely on recommendations - fresh juices to start (pineaple/pear/ginger/cukes), crispy smazing chicken wings (on a bed of tasty greens and fried jalapeno bits), an absoutely mind blowing vichyssoise that stayed until the end as our meal ender, heavenly salad with fried broccoli and some really tasty greens and asian dressing and the coup de grace delivered by a beautiful lunch-portion sized steak!! Dessert was an amazing sensible sized (another foreign US concept) pot de creme with some coffee for the weary road trippers....... oh mama take me back!

we sat on the patio with our dog - so 100 points for allowing that!! the restaurant interior has an ultra cool vibe, the staff is friendly and attentive with great suggestions and there is a rooftop patio that sounded great but we couldnt go for canine reasons! this place is a grand date spot where it is not stuffy and for the pretty coin you spend, you get your money's worth!!!

We agree that in the state of OH, the GHT is the best farm to table restaurant!!!! http://flip.it/gFI4G"}
{"text":"Greenhouse was an unexpectedly great find in downtown Cleveland. The place itself has a great outdoor eating space on this little street that reminded me of outdoor eateries in Europe. Flowers in flower boxes, no cars traveling down the street- pedestrian only. 

As for the eats! ...We started out with the Crispy Chicken Wings Confit, which I highly recommend. Wing meat just fell off the bone and was topped with a delicious salsa of jalapeno and garlic & scallion with a nice hint of citrus. The salty chicken meat, the beautifully fresh & spicy salsa combined into a perfect starter to a great lunch. It's very filling though, so be warned if you are planning on ordering a lunch entree. 

I ordered the spicy chick pea veggie sandwich for my main dish. It was nicely mixed with curry flavor & crispy cabbage. The sandwich was grilled so the tortilla shell was a little crispy, which was a nice touch too. It was paired with a side salad that was fresh and had just enough fresh balsamic vinaigrette. I wish I had more time in Cleveland, I'd have come back for a revisit for sure. The decor of the place is really tasteful & stylish. I'd love to go back for a drink or two at night time. Cool spot!"}
{"text":"Strong 4 Stars on East 4th.  Yumm!  We started with the wings (Crispy chicken wings confit)  and they were out of this world!  They are a little warm, but So Incredible that our table ordered another round of them.  We also had the foie gras steamed clams - good, but overshadowed by the wings. 
Next course was the gravy frites - ridiculousness.  I wanted to try the Fancy Poutine - but the table opted for the frites instead.  
Then we moved on to the Grilled Ohio Lamb Burger that comes with stinky cheese fondue and shallots.  Crazy Good! 
The olive dusted pommes frites that accompanied the burger tasted overwhelmingly of garlic (which I had read in reviews, but thought I would like.... Nope). 
Last, but most certainly not least, we completed the evening with buttered popcorn pot de creme and a late season Sauvignon Blanc that complemented the incredible mouthwatering must-try dessert Oh So Well.  Seriously, it's small - don't go here and not try this dessert.  You'd regret it. 
On another note, while we were there JayZ and Beyoncé had a private table in the kitchen before Lebron's home opener.  Not really relevant, but I wanted to recall why it was so crazy that night.  
Lots of Fun and Lots of Deliciousness!  Next time I am not leaving without the Pig Head and I think that will be a 5 Star Experience for me...  Can't wait!!!  
I love visiting and I'm Loving the great Cleveland Food Scene going on!!! Nice job CLE chefs."}
{"text":"I'm unable to write much of a review, because no one ever waited on me. I was seated by the hostess and after about 15 minutes I realized the people next to me and behind me had been waited on, but no one had even approached me with so much as a glass of water. Perhaps for the best as I found a delightful spot down the block."}
{"text":"It's been a long time coming. I finally got my happy ass to the Greenhouse this week and it WAS all it's cracked up to be. 

My sister and I initially set out to try it during Restaurant Week for the $30 prix fixe menu. We both decided against that menu and went straight for the regular menu and opted for the $44 Chef's Tasting. What a great concept and a terrific way to try many different dishes. Although I must admit, next time I'd do it a bit differently because it ended up being entirely too much food -- even for this chubby girl.

From the killer atmosphere to the ridiculously stellar service, the meal I had at the Greenhouse was among the best of my life thus far. 

I was able to sample 8 different dishes thanks to teamwork with my sis. I won't comment on all of them (nobody really cares THAT much) but I'll just say I enjoyed each dish tremendously. Standout dishes (and those that I want to eat again RIGHT NOW): 
- Crispy Hominy w/ pork shin cracklings, pickled red onion & lime juice.     
- Maine Lobster & Scallop Quenelle w/ tomato coulis & parmesan.
- Crispy Chicken Wings Confit w/ roasted jalapeño, lemon juice, scallions & garlic. 

The only thing I seemed to be a bit disappointed with here was the beer list. I thought the selection was going to be a bit more expansive and it was not. However, I cannot fault them on that since there really aren't many organically or locally produced brews. I hadn't taken the whole point of what they stand for into consideration before I got butthurted about it. Silly me. 

Keep rockin' Chef Sawyer. Your staff is seriously kickass and I hope they get the recognition they so deserve."}
{"text":"Worth every penny. The food is incredible- you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. One of the best restaurants in Cleveland, if not the best."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming , Great service but I expected better quality at a Sawyer restaurant ! Some of the key flavoring components added to dishes seem to be non-exsistant such as truffle mushrooms and foie gras .. where they just put in the description to boost sales?"}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed my Greenhouse Tavern experience. We went for a quick stop and I had the Crispy Hominy, (it was a lot tarter then I expected, almost overwhelming) and I also shared off a plate of the Animal Style Frites (Poutine for our Canadian brethren). 

The beer selection was solid , but I too felt some of the hipster pretentious behavior that I don't appreciate or expect in downtown CLE. 

However, the roof space alone is reason enough for 4 stars. I look forward to going back and having a full meal and maybe they'll get that last star out of me... ."}
{"text":"I had dinner here just before an Indians game. The service was excellent. Very attentive. The only caution. The rooftop is only a bar and does not serve food. As to the quality of the food - very high. I had an Ohio Angus burger with fries. The fries were served Belgian style - in a paper cone with garlic mayo.  My companion had fish. Both meals were above par. Many beers were available. This is an excellent pre-game choice of restaurant - close to all stadiums."}
{"text":"4 years ago, during 4th St. St. Pats day celebration we had some wings and they were pretty good and the Rosemary French fries were yummy. That was the only time we ate there."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner. The brussels sprouts were amazing! And the chicken wings fell right off the bone. I had the rigatoni dish and it was very rich but so so tasty! The service was excellent and we all enjoyed our food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I went to Greenhouse Tavern while on a business trip to Cleveland. A local highly recommended it to us. We ordered the cherry soda, 2001 tea, charcuterie board, beet salad, small plate chicken wings (amazing!!!!!), and pork chop (also amazing!!!!). After a modest tip our bill was $120.

The atmosphere is cozy and the service was fantastic. The appetizers were only so-so. Overall, we felt the price just wasn't worth it despite the amazing main courses and great beverage selections."}
{"text":"We carefully read the online menu and were very happy to take an out of state couple here.After being seated and reading the menu we were surprised to find it wasn't the same menu at all.We chose Greenhouse because of the many choices they had and our guests had some dietary restrictions .After reviewing the menu it was very  different than online and our guests really didn't have the same choices we decided to leave. Please update your menu to be consistent with your in restaurant one."}
{"text":"My GF and I went to the Greenhouse Tavern for New Year's Eve dinner. We were looking forward to it since we had already had a great experience at GHT a couple of years ago. We ordered the 10 course menu and wine pairing. The food was average at best:
- caviar Bellini tasteless. 
- lemon verbana with too much verbana for a pallet cleanser
- asparagus and artichoke tasteless
- short rib tough as overcooked meat
- salty cheese with one crostini!
- good dessert
For the wine pairing, I would say it was one of the most mediocre ones I had.  Even the espresso drink (served with the chocolate dessert) was lukewarm.
The service was so bad that the food runners didn't know what plates they were serving and our server didn't know what course we had or not. The food was hastily put on the table with no words or explanation.  Our server was never around when we needed her. Even the table next to us complained about the lack of service. To add insult to injury a 20% service charge was automatically added to the bill."}
{"text":"SUPER disappointed the last time I went here. I've been coming to this place since they opened and since the last time I went their prices have gone up at least 50% while their portion sizes have gone down by the same amount. Quality is also not quite what it used to be. I was really shocked; this used to be one of the go-to places in Cleveland but their ego got too big or something. Way overpriced these days."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place based on previous Yelp reviews.  The atmosphere is fine, as others have noted.  I ordered the strip steak (medium rare) that is served with pommes frites.  It showed up almost rare which I accepted as I prefer that to the alternative.  I expected to see thin, crispy, bright fries but got a paper cone of dark and limp french fries littered with rosemary leaves, some still on stems.  I literally had to pick my way around them to get to the fries.  I guess the paper cone is how GHT justifies misusing the term.
The service was fine with an attentive waiter who offered suggestions on menu options."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for my husband's birthday a few months ago and it was so-so. I had a chance to try everyone's dish and unfortunately it was hit and miss where some of the plates were amazing and others really weren't worth the price or were down right disappointing. The meal also took 3 1/2 hours which made it feel like it was dragging on forever. By the end we were so tired we could barely enjoy dessert."}
{"text":"This is the place I take anyone who comes to Cleveland from out of town. I love the gravy frites because they are extremely close to an authentic French Canadian poutine. It's the best I get when I'm stateside. :) 

My only complaint is that the stoner sandwich is much too small. It's delicious and it needs to be bigger."}
{"text":"Service was below average but the food was delicious. This is what we had. I loved the brussel sprouts , gnocchi and fish. 

Brussel sprouts- highly recommend this!!! ended up getting another order since it was so good) 

Fried cheese puff - was good but nothing special. 

Kayle salad - was also good but nothing special.

Carrot spaghetti- this was good. I liked the smoked carrot flavor with tahini sauce. 

Eggplant meatball - also recommend this. Very good for vegetarian meatball. Not sure how they were able to keep it moist. It was flavorful. 

Gnocchi: highly recommend this. Soft, buttery and flavorful. Loved the pouched egg on top to make it even more creamy.  

Market fish: highly recommend this if you like fish! it was skinless halibut cooked with tomato purée and coconut milk. Delicious. 

Popcorn Carmel creme brûlée. Loved the salted Carmel. They said it was their best desert. It was great. 

The waiter didn't seem to know the details about the dishes... and was not that attentive."}
{"text":"I have to be honest... the food is good. It's kind of creative. However, for the hype greenhouse receives, i was kinda sad after my meal. I had the veal hamburger so perhaps that's where I went wrong. I also had the chicken wings which i have heard about millions of times, and they were very overcooked. I would say the meal was at best average."}
{"text":"Won't go back. Very over rated. Food is good but service is horrible.  Staff has big egos as if they are the top restaurant in cleveland, which they aren't.  At this price point, I'd go plenty of other places.  Very overrated."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my girlfriend to what many consider to be the best restaurant in Cleveland. Unfortunately, they seemed to have an off night. While the wings were certainly worthy of all the praise, and the brussel sprouts were solid (a touch salty), everything else we ordered left us disappointed.

My girlfriend had the walleye, and she found it mediocre. It was pretty well cooked--the skin was crispy and the meat was light and soft, but it was quite bland. For almost $30 at such a highly regarded restaurant, we expected a wow factor. We also thought the serving size was a bit small.

I ordered the pork chop saltimbocca. Unfortunately, after a few bites, I had to return the dish. There was so much potential for this to be delicious! The pomme puree, scrapple and red eye gravy were perfect accompaniments to the pork, but EVERYTHING was too salty. It was as if they salted it once...and then forgot they had done so, and resalted it again. The waiter was kind enough to take the dish off of our bill, but it was disappointing given our expectations.

Nonetheless, I plan on coming again and am chalking this up to just an anomaly for now."}
{"text":"The lamb burger is so so delicious. Ordered one late last night from their smaller, \"Night Owl\" menu. It was juicy and the cheese and caramelized shallots on top put it over the top. A little greasy but I think lamb burgers tend to be a bit more fatty. The bun it was on was awesome too - nicely toasted and great bread."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I come to Cleveland at least once a month on business to entertain business clientele and this is always a stop along the way.  The food is absolutely amazing and the staff is on point.  The waitress Brittany is amazing with her suggestions on food for the groups that I have brought in and is always spot on with pairing food with their beer selection...I have never had one negative comment on the 10 groups (ranging from 4-12 people per group) I have brought in to this establishment in 2016 alone.  I  always order their bucket of chicken, brussel sprouts and cheese poofs for appetizers.  I also always order the pig head and the Flinestone rib bone as a talking piece for my clients...I still get comments on the pigs head from my clients when I visit them in their states of business and how they have never experienced something like that before in their lives.  On my last trip I had a group of 9 people and normally after dinner I always take them up to the roof top bar for the beautiful scenery of 4th street and the surrounding buildings.  This particular time the roof top bar was closed in preparation for the winter months.  I asked the manager if there was anyway we could go up to the roof top bar.  He was more than accommodating by making the patio seem like it had never been closed for my group to experience the views from the roof...that is service people!  Also, make sure you try their desserts.  The popcorn caramel dessert served in the mini mason jars has become my favorite desert to date...try it!!!  If there are any of you like me that bring clients to The Greenhouse Tavern, make sure as a parting gift to the cooks do the \"kitchen coffees\"...this will be another talking point amounts your clients for years to come!  Thank you Greenhouse Tavern for always making each and every experience memorable...see you in a couple weeks!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Washington, D.C.  I guess I went to this \"edgie downtown\" restaurant with too much prejudice. Cleveland really?  But one look at the menu and I felt as if I was in Chicago at the PURPLE PIG or at Los Angeles' ANIMAL. 
   Total foodie fantasy here! A complete smash up of flavors!  I am sure it would scare some faint of heart. But for the creative, lover of food, this is it!  Here is a place to take your \"buds\" for a ride. 
   We had awesome service from (Kreighton?) He took us on a culinary ride and helped us steer our \"journey\".  The Animal Fries were off the hook! The Sloppy Jo-Nut loved by all for the neat idea was too sweet for us. The fried doughnut filled with BBQ beef rib was good but the BBQ  sauce on the Jo-nut made it too sweet. If you get the Sloppy Jo-nut get the BBQ sauce on the side or not at all.
   Desserts awesome do get the Buttered Popcorn pot de creme. 
   We had the good fortune to have one of the owners come to the table and tell us they will be on Iron Chef January 22. He was so gracious and though we asked him about the results on the Iron Chef he was as tight lipped as little neck clam. Guess we will be tuning in! Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"I love a good patio. If you do too, the rooftop in the summer is well worth it. After work or after a concert @HOB it never disappoints. The bartenders are friendly and it usually provides for great people watching. Hungry?... head inside or on the patio out front. Their menu is delicious and the portions are huge...and even larger depending on what you order. Priding themselves on their use of local goods, Greenhouse does an excellent job. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Had the pork saltimbocca that was just amazing and the wings for appetizer. Chef saywer knows exactly how to balance each dish to perfection"}
{"text":"I was in town from Chicago for a conference and happy that we chose Greenhouse as one of our dinners. Our waiter Creighton? sp? was great, a bit over the top but I enjoyed it. Ramps were in season so we tried to eat as much with them in it, ramp wrapped asparagus, ramp baked chicken in a pastry shell, delish, we also had the animal fries which were so good, and I am going to try and replicate the dish at home. The beer and wine choices were great, overall a great experience and really enjoyed our time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"They were out of everything tonight food wise, apps came out after dinner, apps came out wrong, wife wanted a martini and she only had two vodka options.  Would have been fine if the prices were lower but it was bar food at Lola prices..."}
{"text":"Burger, check. Mushroom risotto, yum. Server was super nice. Hooked us up with a free dessert because mains took a bit too long. Dessert was on point. Would return."}
{"text":"Great vibe to the restaurant, total hipster feel and great for bicycle enthusiast to check out all the decor. I did not believe the food was worth the price for which we payed. MY friend tried the vegan burger and said it was great. Great atmosphere, good food, over priced."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the cold corn soup. Very good. Also loved the tomato sandwich. Enjoyed an outside table in a Cleveland hot-spot."}
{"text":"Love love love the Greenhouse. It's easily my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Awesome beer selection, great craft menu, great deserts. Must get the pot de creme for desert...no excuses...just get it. The experience is great. 

When I had clients, family, or friends in town we always went to the greenhouse. In the summer try sitting outside on east 4th or on the roof top patio. 

Chef Sawyer is the real deal.

I've eaten just about everything on the menu and its all fantastic. I wish they'd bring back the bread board they used to have with the custom spreads...it was the bomb. My personal favorites are the Duck Confit Wings, Beef Tar Tar, Pigs Head Or Beef short rib (aka Fred Flintstone), and the Pot De Creme for desert...thats if i had to pick favorites

Don't think twice..go here on your trip or night out in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What can I say about this amazing place?

I took my future wife here on a beautiful night in CLE and introduced her to the wonderful things this city has to offer.  The entrance is warm and inviting and the decor makes you feel like you've stepped into a new urban world.

We started off the night with french bread with pig paste, and I had the duck pasta.  All local ingredients, the best part of the meal besides the taste was the portion control.  Too often you go to a restaurant and they overload your plate with food...not at Greenhouse Tavern.

While it may be pricey and a once in a while treat, it's worth every penny to come to GHT.  Chef Sawyer and crew have done an amazing thing on E. 4th Street.

Come to the CLE and have a wonderful night out at Greenhouse Tavern!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  I recently had the beef tartar and pork and pumpkin pasta and would highly recommend both."}
{"text":"So here we are.. we come in ask for a barstool for our group of 3. No bar seats available and we were seated at a table. A few hours later and a few hundred dollars of food drinks we get the boot by the front of the house manager for a \"wheelchair customer\"! Who had requested the table.  We were not offered a different table, not a complimentary drink, not even a thank you. 
And after waiting around be for a bit to see the \"wheelchair\" they sat 4 able bodied individuals. 
Thanks a lot for the lies and not taking more of my money asshole!"}
{"text":"Over the top service. 
Bloody Mary was a great start. Followed by a savory  Meaty Slinger. Great food ... hope to come back again."}
{"text":"Came here before a Cav's game, of course it was packed and there were very few spots at the bar and no tables available even though there were only 2 of us @ 5:30pm. Definitely not a problem though, because I kinda figured it would be packed pre-game. It was my friends birthday and she preferred to sit at more a table setting so we grabbed seats at the window. I would definitely recommend it, especially when there are things going on downtown. It makes for great people watching. 
I got the tabasco fried chicken and the pot de creme since I wasn't super hungry.
She got the lamb burger which came with fries and the souffle. 

The chicken was not my favorite, a little on the bland side (could have used some salt) and the coating was a little greasy, although very crunchy. It had a nice spice to it from the tabasco, but otherwise there wasn't a lit of flavor and for 12 bucks for a leg and thigh and nothing else I was expecting the best fried chicken I've ever had. Or at least something close.

The pot de creme was delicious per usual.

The lamb burger was cooked perfectly and my friend loved it. I grabbed a bite and it was delicious, and I'm not even a big fan of lamb. The souffle was delicious as well.

I'm looking forward to trying some other things, but I definitely don't think I'll get the tabasco fried chicken again."}
{"text":"Just came here this past weekend for my nephew's Communion celebration.  Was extremely impressed with the patient and on-call wait staff that catered to our every need, which included a dozen rowdy kids!  The food was divine, and I think I veer to say, that those duck fat fries are the best fries I've ever had.  The wings were delicious with a very surprising but extremely pleasant lemon aftertaste.  The skirt steak was awesome.   I wish I could order and ship the friesto D.C...  Everytime I go back to visit my sister in Cleveland, I am making sure we stop here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland, so I always choose to go here for my birthday dinners. Don't miss the bar on the top of the roof in the summertime -- it's the best urban view in the city."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Patio was great. Lamburger was the best!  Server don was very knowledgable and excellent all around."}
{"text":"Lots of hype around sustainability.  Kudos for local food and recycled materials and green renovation.  But can you go the next step to walk the talk and reduce (or eliminate) the animal products on the menu?  

There was only one entree for which the waitress was able to offer a vegan version.  Even the pommes frites were off the list, as they're fried in duck fat.  A number of other dishes were made with parmesan-based broth.

So, we ordered a bunch of sides.  Disappointed with miniscule portions for the price.  3 ravioli's for $9?  4 pencil-thin carrots for $8?  C'mon, we're not expecting to leave overstuffed or with a doggy bag of leftovers, but we don't want to leave hungry enough to need another snack when we get home.  And we are thin, healthy and small eaters!

Please see the film Forks Over Knives.  There is a bigger market out there for vegan than you think.  It's not just for the granola-set anymore!"}
{"text":"A group of us were visiting Cleveland for a very quick (and cold) trip this past weekend, and started our visit with brunch/lunch here at the Greenhouse Tavern. 

The 4 of us all ordered individual dishes and then ended up sharing most of what was on the table. I ordered the Rice & Bean Veggie Burger (decent, maybe kind of underwhelming - but came with a REALLY good side salad.) Other dishes on the table were: the Fried Brussels Sprouts (delicious), a Caesar Salad (very tasty - I enjoyed the added capers), some chicken wings (didn't try any) and Veggie GHT Slinger (didn't try any either.)

I loved the vibe of the place and would love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Went to the Greenhouse Tavern for the first time this past Saturday. Despite having reservations we had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. We were comped some free fries which was a nice gesture. The staff was very busy, but handled everything well. The food was good however not in-line with the prices. No one in our party had any of the big ticket items like the pig's head or the Fred Flintstone ribs and perhaps those give you more bang for your buck. One service error occurred when my friend ordered black tea and was served green tea. Overall, I was not all that impressed. Would I give The Greenhouse Tavern another try? Sure. Am I excited about the dining experience? No. Maybe they had an off night?"}
{"text":"Gloomy day and a delicious meal. The pomme frito with gravy hit the spot! Cesar salad with chicken was plentiful and delicious. Walleye and bib salad wonderful. We will be back. Sit in the front window and people watch."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! We went there for brunch...Loved everything. Eggs Bennie was just plain delicious. Hubby got the crispy pig ears and poutine and he really enjoyed both. Bloody Mary packed a lot of flavor. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Cleveland/4th St!"}
{"text":"I'm deeply disappointed, there were 7 of us for a friends birthday, 3 of us got beef burgers which were almost 20 dollars (all bland), 2 of us got steaks which which were 30 dollars both were tough and salty, one person got the ravioli which was 13 dollars for 3 undercooked ravioli that tasted terrible, and one of us had a lamb burger which first came out as a beef burger and then as an undercooked lamb burger, when we brought the problems with the lamb and the ravioli up to the server she just said \"ohh okay do you want something else\" instead of an apology. When we went to pay the lamb and ravioli was taken off of our bills, however I noticed that my 8 dollar buffalo trace and cokes were 10 dollars. We then went to find a manger who then told me it was standard for most places to charge for mixers (I've been to most places downtown and the only ones who do charge for mixers tell you before hand either on the menu or in person, neither which happened tonight). On top of which when I went to find the manager our server was talking to a bartender about how we were being difficult about our food and stopped talking when she noticed me standing there. The manager then offered no other apology than we strive for excellence and I will speak to the owner about your experience. Now I've worked in restaurants for over 10 years and the server nor the manager asked us how they could make it up to us. For an over 200 dollar bill I'd expect either the food, the service, or the drinks make it worth it; and none of which did. I'd like to speak with the owner himself because we would all like for them to make this experience up to us."}
{"text":"Two words: lamb burger. Get it, savor it, and thank me later! Would have given 4 stars but gave five just because of the burger. Yes, the lamb burger is close your eyes and chew slowly good!! Another great item was the beef tartar, very flavorful and delicious. Really loved the ambiance of this place and if I lived in Cleveland this restaurant would be my regular spot! Thank you Greenhouse Tavern for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"The fried chicken bucket - yes!!! Delicious fried brussels sprouts, along with an excellent beef tartar and pommes frites. Finish up with the salted butter pot de creme (skip the hand pie). Bustling clientele, lively ambiance, fun location, friendly and efficient service. Memorable."}
{"text":"Just a great experience. Staff, very friendly. Food, fantastic! Atmosphere, warm (and in cold wintry Cleveland on the lake, that's important). If you are in Cleveland and want a treat. This is your place!"}
{"text":"Had the zeppoli with pancetta and the venison pasta.  Both were delicious.  Best meal I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, nice environment. Friendly staff. Pleasant experience.

I ordered Ohio burger, nice beef burger and it comes with nice house salad. I liked the house kachtub"}
{"text":"Not sure what I was expecting from my outing to Greenhouse.  The selection of beverages was good.  The prices are more than I was willing to pay for the portion size that I got.  The ambience was suboptimal.  I sat in the loft with my brother and father as they were visiting Cleveland.  For some reason, multiple business parties were there simultaneously and either everyone was already drunk or deaf because we couldn't hear each other at our table due to the ridiculous amount of noise.  The wait is often considerable and not sure its justified for the finished product received."}
{"text":"I need to redact my old review, mainly because this time I knew what to expect and how to order going in. I love Greenhouse. The duck wings are orgasmic, animal frites are an indulgent dream and the flint stone short is MASSIVE. Be sure to share it with 2-3 people but it is so tender!!! The meat falls off the bone. I've been craving it and need to make a reservation ASAP."}
{"text":"There is something magical about the GHT's mulled cider with bourbon....after a day of playing outside in the cold and snow, there is nothing I would like more than to cozy up to the bar here and warm my hands around the snifter of liquid gold."}
{"text":"The beer list is not very exciting and I really enjoyed the chicken jalapeño wings. By far the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Incredibly inattentive service; server and somm only started to pay attention/were friendly when we were on the way out.  It took 10 minutes to let us know the first wine we ordered wasn't available, and it took another 10 to bring up the 2008 vintage.  We had to ask for it to be decanted, which took another 15, and had to pour our own wine throughout the meal, even though the somm was half hovering.  Wings arrived soggy/lukewarm and the plate was super hot--they were clearly under the warmer too long. The steak was oversalted and nearly inedible.  Maybe it was our fault for sitting on the balcony far from the kitchen, but the service left us speechless.

Poor food and poorer service, especially when the wine was $425 of the $500 bill on a two top for a celebratory dinner--disappointing."}
{"text":"After waiting for many years, I finally made it to Cleveland to try this spot.  My husband dines here each month when he is visiting Cleveland for business, so I had heard about the delicious food.  Upon entering, I loved the decor----bikes hanging on the walls?  Pretty cool.  Even the restrooms were unique.  Anyhow, the staff was very helpful and attentive.  The cocktails were fantastic.  I tried one that was on the specials list, and it was creative and balanced.   The animal frites are best enjoyed as a half portion....as they are huge, delicious, rich, and a big bowl of goodness!  The lamb burger and wings (my favorite item of the night) were also dynamic.  Cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a terrible experience at the restaurant next door so the next time we were in the neighborhood, we decided to go to Greenhouse.  The food is of absolute quality here and our server was personable without being overbearing.  They show 80s/90s films on a VHS player, which really couldn't be cooler.  Decor is great as well; and the place itself is large so even though they were busy there was no wait.  

My only issue was that the music is quite loud and it was borderline sensory overload with everything else going on.

All the same, an enjoyable experience.  Definitely a place to frequent multiple times."}
{"text":"I will never go to Greenhouse's \"Happy\" Hour again. 

They advertise their vodka drinks for $3, however when you get the bill you will realize that the 1 vodka drink you ordered is actually $7...which is NOT a happy hour price.

I asked why the drink went from the advertised price of $3 to over 2x that amount and they said that they had to charge me to open a new bottle of vodka? They also said that soda water is an extra $2 as well. If your standard vodka soda happy hour drink is going to be $7 then advertise it as such!! 

Why should I have to pay to open a bottle of vodka that the bar was going to have to open anyway???? And how hard is it to open the bottle??? Vodka doesn't go bad!! Why charge your customers to open a bottle??

I ended up spending $17 after I ordered a small side caesar salad (and when I say small I mean a side bread plate small) and 1 drink. I actually ordered the hummus dish first, however they were out of hummus....

There is NOTHING happy about this happy hour. The bartender didn't tell us that we had to pay extra for soda water or opening the bottle of vodka and the original dish I ordered wasn't even available. 

Also - side note, they don't have any wine for happy hour either. Not sure what people enjoy about this restaurant."}
{"text":"SERVICE: 4
Very friendly and attentive server once she actually got around to us. She was helpful with advice for those of us who had never been here. The bus staff is lacking and there were a couple of mix-ups.

DECOR: 3
Nice outdoor area  on the main drag in downtown Cleveland. Great for people-watching. Nothing special otherwise.

FOOD: 3
We had:
Radish with butter
Bread board - a couple of cold pieces of bread, plus a large cracker. But the sauces were pretty good.
Ravioli - OMG. It was awful. Tasted like a bit of pasta SMOTHERED in herbs. Way too \"herbie\"
Clams - good but not great.
Steak frites - got temperatures wrong
Vegan tasting menu - chef accomodated our vegan friend nicely though after exciting him about vegan doughnuts told him they were out.
Caesar salad - did not resemble salad, small and unfilling

VALUE: 3
About $200 for 4 with food and drink. Not expensive for Chicago but a bit much for Cleveland. Better food at all other places at which I dined in  Cleveland and this was one of the more expensive.


OVERALL: 3
An all around average restaurant worth a visit if you live in Cleveland and want to try different places. If visiting and only have limited dining windows, ditch this place and go to Blue Point."}
{"text":"Wow, I really have to say that the stone fruit almond dessert is the single most grotesque thing I've had in ages. The sage ice cream tasted like a particularly potent strain of marijuana, but without any of the fun side effects. All the flavors clashed. Definitely more style than substance here, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I've never experienced a place like Cleveland, where the two best restaurants in town are situated right next to each other. The Greenhouse Tavern is right next to Lola and both eateries are fabulous. 

 The Greenhouse Tavern prides itself on using only local, organic foods. I have no idea where they get their grub from, all I know is everything I tasted was mouthwatering and delicious. 

 My Wife and I have a little game we play when we dine regarding who ordered the better dish. For some reason, I usually end up winning. In this case, she kicked my ass. Don't get me wrong, my steak was fabulous. But her lamb burger ranks right up there with the best I've ever tasted. I was tempted to order one as a second entree, but I was just too full. Both the entrees and deserts we ordered were off the charts good. 

 So once again, a city proves me wrong. All the preconceived notions I had about Cleveland were wrong. This City has a vibrant food scene that is second to none for a City its size. Its a place where you can get a NYC quality dinner at a Cleveland price. Greenhouse Tavern ranks right up there with some of the best dining experiences I've had. If your traveling to Cleveland, be sure to add this to your list of places to eat. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"--3.5 stars--
I enjoyed my dinner at this place, even more so considering my colleague and I were able to get seats at the bar on a busy Friday night without reservations. I had the Ohio lamb burger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted and worked well with the unique assortment of toppings such as the sticky cheese fondue and champagne shallot. The bun on the burger was quite mushy  from either the side salad dressing or the greasiness of the burger, which was bit of an unappetizing aspect of an otherwise great meal. My only hesitation with the place is the price point...in my opinion overpriced, but definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"For a restaurant with the GHT's reputation - and prices - I expect a certain level of excellence to be built into the experience. Not sure if it was because we went at 8:30 on a Sunday, or if GHT us falling off it's game, but I was terribly disappointed.

Took friends from out of town and we were seated at a window table in the cool little loft nook - intimate with a great view if the street. Great start.

After the server provided the explanation of Firsts, Seconds, Thirds and Halves - we ordered what we thought was a good combination of appropriately sized choices. We got no insight from him to assist us in our choices, only a listing of what was depleted and the replacement items. Since he'd asked if this was our first visit - I was surprised he provided no insights into the choices, sourcing, etc.- something that has been a constant at other eateries that pride themselves on their sustainable menu.

Devils on Horseback had great flavor, but arrived at the table lukewarm at best - almost starting to chill - which took away from a great combination of flavors. The Animal Fries were HUGE and should be shared or ordered as a meal themselves - but were listed as a Half on the menu - which is suggested as a Side. Sadly, our table of four also got an order of the regular Gravy Fries - to share and one  diner's meal also came with fries ... but, being the only person who was aware of the portion sizes, accompaniments, etc. - our server did not bring this overabundance of frites to our attention - so while they were great, the portions were way too big to allow us to really enjoy our Third courses. I would have expected the server to just mention it - the beauty of great service is that the server - through his knowledge - guides you around these possible pitfalls.

The Gravy Fries were also served close to lukewarm ... The fries at the bottom were hot, but the top third had cooled significantly before it arrived at our table. Other choices - Ohio City Pasta and Ceasar were judged to be good - but not great.

The Chicken Fried Lamb did not arrive at the table hot. The tastes were great - with the sharply acid slaw providing a superb accent for the rich lamb and savory gravy and mash. The Steak was ordered medium rare and arrived exceptionally rare -- almost just a sear on the meat. The diner did not send it back, but was clearly not overwhelmed by the dish (took 2/3 home - including the 'round 3' of fries). The Burger was judged OK - but not stellar. 

Overall - we were disappointed with the service and the food - after hearing so many raves about both. If the food had arrived at the table hot, it might have helped tremendously, but we'll never know. I'm sorry that this was our friends' only impression of an outstanding restaurant in Cleveland -- because GHT did not measure up to the buzz. We'll continue trying new places, but won't be back to GHT with so many other places getting everything right."}
{"text":"mmm...MEAT

Fries and croutons are cooked in duck fat. The butter that is brought out with bread has pork in it. Vegetarians, stay home!

In short, the Greenhouse has excellent food at a great price. The person who said the portions are small must have been comparing them to the Old Country Buffet. The portions are definitely generous. The decor is really cool. I loved the bike rim chandeliers. 

Since I was going to the HOB after, I couldn't deal with leftovers. I opted for a first, second and half course instead of an entree. Oh yah, AND desert ;)  For the first, I chose the Pork Pate Maison. It came with proscuitto, pickles and whole grain mustard. The pate was topped with bacon. Yum! For the second course, I had the Cripsy Chicken Wings Confit. These were some of the best wings I have ever had. The meat fell off the bone, yet the outside was crispy. Pure heaven. For the half course (sides), I chose the Frisee Side Salad. From the name, I was expecting a tiny little salad. What arrived at the table was a heaping mound of greens dressed in a light vinaigrette. Hiding underneath was creamy goat cheese and pickled onions. It was so refreshing. Perfect. I just had to have desert and an espresso. I opted for the Petit Fours, which is a miscellaneous selection of goodies. Mine included a brownie, chocolate chip cookie, a cake-like coconut macaroon, a little cake with icing, a buttery pastry and a chocolate truffle. My fav was the truffle with red pepper flakes. 

If you are watching your waist line, The Greenhouse may not be your best option. There are a lot of french offerings and they are full of (yummy) calories. Although you can just get smaller courses and avoid a large entree. But why would you want to??!!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch Sunday on our way out of town.  This place is FANTASTIC!  I wish I lived closer to go here more often.  That being said, I will definitely be planning a trip back to Cleveland just to visit Greenhouse Tavern again.  We were fortunate to snag a table outside on a beautiful Sunday morning.  Started with a cocktail, the Sawyer Sauer.  If you're a bourbon fan, this is a must try.  After much debate, I settled on ordering the Animal Frites and the Mrs. ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits pasta with a poached egg.  The food was better than expected.  The Animal Frites is poutine with brown gravy, cheese curds, whole grain mustard and topped with two fried eggs.  I should include that I avoid fried eggs like the plague as I do not like them Sam I am.  However on this day, I threw caution the wind and ate them.  The wife's pasta was delicious and judging how neither of us said much while eating, I'm guessing she enjoyed it as well.  When in Cleveland, make sure you make a reservation at Greenhouse Tavern!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps best Chicken Sandwich anywhere in the world if one is into Fried Chicken. Hip location, good service, and surprisingly affordable lunch menu"}
{"text":"Not for me.  Pretentous.  If you want to grab a simple beer or jack and ginger, rum coke, they don't have it.  They only stare at you with a blank look.  This place has a special menu."}
{"text":"Wound up here a few minutes before 10pm desperate for food on a Sunday night after lousy service at Chocolate Bar.  Our party of five was seated and served well.  One or two lunches never did anything for me here, but GHT made a much better impression this night.  Tried to stay cheap - ordered the very, very, very hot beans & greens and the Tomato sandwich - both were really good.  Friends were very impressed with the fancy wings and burgers (we were saving our money for drinks and cab fare)."}
{"text":"Jonathan Sawyer is well known for his food in Cleveland. He was on Iron Chef America and was featured in Food and Wine. So, I had very high expectations when I visited his restaurant. I came for lunch with my husband. He ordered the big Caesar salad and I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. My husband loved his salad. The romaine is roasted which gives the salad a lovely smokey flavor. My sandwich was alright. I loved the tobasco mash on the bread. It was a nice touch. I was not a fan of the pickles on the sandwich and since it was not listed as an ingredient on the menu's description I had no idea that they would be there. I think the food here is decent and I like the concept of local ingredients and farm to table. But, I think I was just anticipating a wow factor that just wasn't present. The next time I'm in town, I may try to give this place another shot!"}
{"text":"Cool but noisy atmosphere. Expensive for what it is. Great bread basket, though. Dessert is good,too. Meat dishes - not so much. It is actually more expensive than Lola's next door and I would definitely go next door if I had to choose."}
{"text":"Upon having dinner here for a second time, I can honestly say that this is my favorite restaurant for really good food.  The dishes are full of flavor. You could get by with sharing 4 appetizers between 2 people for your meal (brussel sprouts  and chicken wings are lights out good. The chicken wings aren't spicy but have a wonderful citrus flavor and are fall off the bone delicious). That could be the way to go because so many good ones to choose from. We shared 3 and then the lamb burger (which is pure deliciousness as well) and were stuffed. Servers are friendly and great cocktails/wine/beer selection.  Plus great location for people watching and just charming atmosphere. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"UNDERWHELMING IN EVERY WAY. NEVER COME HERE.

Came here on a Friday night with a companion, and found the restaurant surprisingly sparse of patrons. Ordered a Great Lakes beer (good) and a cocktail (okay).

Hype about the food and service is not to be believed. Both should, in fact, be readily dismissed. Between us, we ordered the poached egg omelet (stunningly bad); crispy wings (a bit too spicy for most palates); rice burger (tasted like a frozen dinner); and Tomahawk steak (only mouthfuls of fat).

Our server provided erratic service, seemed like he was either drunk or high on a substance, and failed to check back on us regularly. Horrendous.

Greenhouse Tavern's website touts itself as a \"rust belt revolution.\" I struggle to resist a case of the giggles. The restaurant is in actuality far from a revolution -- maybe a limp, disappointing Arab Spring."}
{"text":"I only sampled the late night menu while I was here, so I can't vouch for all the food, but we were more than pleased with what we had. The food was good and the beer selection was both great and affordable if not cheap. I would definitely come back for some gravy fries and a beer."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were in town visiting friends from college, and we had tickets to a comedy show Saturday night at the Hilarities comedy club. After looking at a lot of menus online, we decided on the Greenhouse Tavern on East 4th. We had 8pm reservations and they were ready for us as soon as we got there, which is always nice. That was probably the only good thing about this whole experience. I'm not one to be very critical of dining experiences, as I can usually find anything good out of it, but I have to say I think our server was the worst part. Now, it could have been that he was just having a bad day, but he was not personable, and when we were asking questions, he almost seemed annoyed to have to answer our questions. Aside from that, they brought table bread for us, with a hummus spread. My friend was in the process of fixing herself a piece, and as soon as the last piece of bread was off that plate, someone came and took it away, even though she was still using the spread. Okkkkk we thought... moving along..

Our first course came, which was really good. I had the curried squash spaghetti, which was really good. No problems with that. Our next course came, and my friend had gotten an omelet dish. She had put her fork down with maybe 1/3 of her meal to go, and another waiter came over and picked it up to take it away! She quickly said \"I'm NOT done with that!\" and he put it down. This happened 4 times throughout the meal where they would just grab plates when we weren't done with our food. It was a little bizarre and we just kept laughing at disbelief. 

The portions aren't large, and I feel overpriced for what you get. I ordered a vegetarian dish that had ONE piece of tofu, ONE piece of a chick pea loaf, ONE carrot, and broth and it was $22. Seemed a little silly. After spending almost $50 and not having any alcohol, we left hungry and disappointed at the level of service in what seemed to be a higher-end establishment. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here nor would I ever visit this place again."}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love this place. Beautiful summer day and lucky enough to snag a seat on the patio!
I got the wings and fries for lunch and it was perfect. The wings literally fell off the bone! I don't know what it is, but they have the best around. Also had a nice cold cider which tasted just like a mimosa! I can say overall myself as well as my co workers were extremely satisfied. The only thing that would have made it 5 stars was if our waiter had been a little more attentive. I had to get up and ask another server for a to go box, my server didn't even offer. 
But overall it was good."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to this place, so I decided to go back.  I paid a visit the first week it opened and service was ok at best, the menu didn't properly describe the food, and I left underwhelemed.  I returned six month's later and we got terrible service, a menu that didn't properly explain the dishes, and ho hum food.  I went back last year and sat at the bar instead of a table and service was great, the food was good, and it was a three-star experience.  It might have been a four-star experience had I not heard constant employee high-school-like gossip going on in full customer view and earshot.  At that point, I decided this just wasn't the place for me.  Much to my dismay, some friends really wanted to go here recently.  I reluctantly attended and I really wish I just opted out for the night or forced everyone to head down the street to Lola.  GHT's prices are pretty much the same to that of Lola anyways.

First, service sucked worse than ever.  Our server seemed distracted and scatterbrained.  She got most of our orders wrong and our drinks arrived about the same time our main course arrived.  Our second round of drinks didn't come until it came time to pay our bill--about 20 minutes after we ordered them.  She gave us the drinks for free given all the trouble, but she put another table's food on our bill.  It took us 30 minutes to actually get out of the place because of the check problems.  I would have asked to see a manager, but our server was barely present that it wasn't even worth the additional hassle.

I didn't bother to order anything fancy because it all seemed priced higher than the value.   I wouldn't mind checking out the pig's head, but it wasn't available and I'm told they generally only have a few each week.  I wonder if it's really any good or just something over-hyped through legend.  If it's like the pig's head at Au Pied de Cochon in MontrealI, then count me in.  But past experience tells me this pig's head is popular in Cleveland lore because no one around town does a pig's head.  So... I opted for the over-priced burger.  The burger was a letdown.  What I hear is supposed to be some fancy custom grind, actually tasted like 85/15 grocery store ground beef. My friends got the lamb burger, which tasted ok with the bite I stole, but it wasn't worth the $17.  Not by a mile.

With all I've said, I want to be clear that my rating is based only on my most recent visit, the quality of service at that visit, the quality and value in the burger, and the quality and value of the lamb burger.  During this visit, service is the worst I've seen out of any restaurant, the beef quality wasn't worth the price, and the lamb burger was absurdly overpriced.  I don't think I could go back to try anything else.  I'm worried ab out service and I'm worried about whether I'm wasting my money if I buy something more substantial and expensive.  Truthfully, I don't get the hype about this place.  I never have.  This restaurant seems to be the product of successful marketing winning over quality of product and service."}
{"text":"We went with a party of 18 people from another state last night. From the service to the food...it was awesome. Our server was grwat, food was tasty. Everyone in our large party had 0 complaints. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the bomb.  You can get a shot of whiskey, pickle back and a black label can of beer for 5 bucks.  It's so great and beef tartar is amazing."}
{"text":"By writing this, I get to relive my meal and that makes me happy.  If you're looking for giant portions of food, look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for incredibly tasty food prepared well with elements that meld together perfectly, stop by Greenhouse Tavern.  It isn't cheap but coming from the East Coast, I actually thought it was very fairly priced.

The fried matzah ball might be replicated at my house, though I'm unsure how to replicate the chicken liver mousse and \"schmaltz verde,\" a hilarious and delicious mash-up of chicken fat and pesto.  Yum!  The firsts and seconds (read: amuse bouche and appetizers) were delicious and enticing, but the best part were the thirds.  I ate the porkchops saltimbocca.  It was like pork heaven served on a pig shaped platter, with some creamy potatoes underneath and a red eye gravy on top.  I have no idea what they did to the meat on the bone but it was salty, porky and rich.  My boyfriend had the chicken fried lam chops.  I am always wary of things that are \"chicken fried\" which is usually code for \"tasteless fried meat.\"  Not so here!  Big portion of lamby-tasting lamb with the best gravy ever.

Dessert was a teeny-weeny portion--just enough to have a little bite of dessert.  I liked it, but you might try elsewhere if you have a large sweet tooth.

I loved Greenhouse Tavern--I will just keep thinking about that pork."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to go downtown for dinner because it was my last night in Cleveland before going back to Toronto. Like Anthony P., I had read so many great reviews for Greenhouse Tavern. I had very high expectations and left slightly disappointed.

Great location! Situated on 4th Street, a closed off street in d/t Cleveland, you get to take in all the great restos that Cleveland has. The decor of Greenhouse is really nice too - very hipster.

The service was quite slow. My sister and I were here for almost two hours. Luckily we had all the time in the world.

The food was meh considering the price point. I had the steak frites; the steak was pretty good, but the frites were extremely salty. My sister had the lamb burger, again, she found the burger tasty, but could only taste the salt in her frites. The drink menu is not that big, but they do have some unique beers. I had the gluten free raspberry ale and it was quite sweet and light.

I'll be okay if I don't come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited cle this past weekend and this was hands down our favorite place that we visited. It was a really interesting and relaxed atmosphere and reminded us of one of our favorite pubs on 6th street in Austin. We had the wings confit as well as the fritas. Both were excellent. The staff was very attentive and knowledgable as to their beers and food. Probably wont be back to the area any time soon but will def come back if we do."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Horrible service. Ordered a burger, comes with chips for $14. Then waited over 10 minutes for ketchup and mayo. Our drinks were empty the whole meal. Never coming back"}
{"text":"GET THE WINGS! Enough said. Everything else is good but the wings are amazing, the prefect mixture of tenderness, crispy outside, and flavor.

The clams are pretty outstanding too. You'll need extra bread to sop up that delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Wow. Extremely delicious. I'm not one to order a steak at a restaurant, I think I can make a better one at home, for a fraction of the price. In fact, a week before I ate at Greenhouse, I told my fiancé, \"I'm never ordering a steak at a restaurant again.\" But, I couldn't pass up what was titled, \"Perfectly Butchered Rib Steak.\" Hands down, best steak I've every eaten at a restaurant; the second isn't even in the same stratosphere, and I've eaten some prime steaks at some of the finest steakhouses in the country. Now, I just won't order a steak at a restaurant, except for Greenhouse Tavern.  I was extremely impressed and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! We sat at the bar, got the tasting menu, let the bartender pick our courses... Had the foie gras clams and pigs face (OMG) and the salted caramel popcorn pot de creme. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage.  Our 1-year anniversary dinner at GHT would have been \"sub-par\" for a cheap chain like Applebee's.  Instead, the crappy food and poor service came with a tab that ran well over twice that amount.

Chicken wings: Small & sickly-looking wings that were over-cooked by an offensive amount.

Strip steak: A *terrible* cut of meat.  Chewy with tendons, I've literally had better $10 sirloins from TGIF.  To their credit, the steak was ordered \"rare\" and cooked just about perfectly.

Cocktails: Pretty delicious, except some random busboy snatched my glass that was still 1/2 full, dumped it into a sink with some other dirty glasses and walked away without as much as a word.

The service and atmosphere were pretty lame as well. Our waitress was unattentive. I'm still mad at their dopey drink-stealing busboy.  We were stuffed into bench-style seating, cramming us in next to a party of four while nearby tables sat empty.

Conclusion: 
Poorly-sourced meats, below-average service & atmosphere, EXTREMELY overpriced.
Will NEVER eat here again.
Would NEVER recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Lake Fish Goujon - We had to have a laugh when we saw the size of these pate-a-choux fritters. 5 marbles. Hilarious. I thought we were on vacation from SF, guess not.
Confit Chicken Wings - Tender, spicy, fairly-crispy but a touch SALTY.
'Crunchy Kale Salad' - Not sure what was crunchy about it beside the fact that it's kale? Maybe that's how they get midwesterners to eat their greens? Fat boy croutons didn't seem very fatty.
Beef Tartare - SALTY.
Also got some grilled tomatoes. Which tasted like grilled tomatoes.


Overall the grub was decent. A bit disappointing, actually. Our server was nice and the best part was walking down the stairs with the 'kitchen coffees' and listening to the cooks go ape-sh*t wild!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Ingredients are sustainably sourced and best of all, delicious. This is the place to go if you love savory dishes, but not the place to go if you are on a fat-free diet! This restaurant specializes in guilty pleasures.

Among the top foods to try:

1. Gravy frites or Animal frites. Decadent. Poutine basically. French fries fried in duck fat. Gravy and cheese curds. If that's not enough, you can opt for the animal frites that would add fried eggs and bacon. Fries somehow taste good, but something magical happens when combined with cheese, we all know that. But the addition of gravy or egg or bacon however; places this dish in my short list for \"last meal on earth\" if I was on death row. Not advisable if you have a heart condition, unless of course, you indeed are on death row.

2. Chicken wings confit. This is different from your typical fried wing. If braised in oil like they would a duck confit, then you can imagine that the meat will end up flaky and fall-off-the-bone tender, with fat all well rendered (with the typical wing, I find these gross pockets of whole undercooked fat in the wing that I find unappealing -- not this one), and crispy -- almost like pork rinds (I hate soggy wings, they remind me of tyson microwave products). The sauce it was tossed in, has acidity and a lot of garlic that cuts through the wing. This is my absolute favorite chicken wing dish.

3. Pork chop saltimboca. This is not just a pork chop, although not explicitly stated, there's a bit of pork belly in there. This pork chop has it all, great flavors, tender sweat meat and fat content that is well-rendered. I used the term \"rendered\" a lot -- basically fat that is not rendered is solid, dense and gross.

There's too many good things to order that I'm not mentioning: grass fed beef burger, steak frites, foie gras clams; and it's hard to find something here that's not good. If I had to take out-of-town guests (that I like) to only one restaurant in Cleveland, this would be it."}
{"text":"I lived in Cleveland for a long time but never thought about restaurants like this because I never had any money. Then I moved away to Washington, DC (same \"brain drain\" story you've probably heard a thousand times, I know). We've got more restaurants in Washington than you could figure out what to do with. They're all expensive, probably over-priced, but eventually you get used to it and just swallow your pride and pay what it costs.

Since I left I heard that Cleveland has experienced some sort of \"Restaurant Renaissance\" and the beauty of it is that since Cleveland is such a dirt-cheap city in just about every way, you can experience fine dining for very little money compared to the stuffy elite restaurants on the east coast. People like me can \"come home and feel like you're living like a king\" as someone desperately trying to sell me on Cleveland explained it. I'll admit that it sounded very appealing.

So my judgement for Cleveland restaurants is against a certain benchmark. If the quality is the same as what I can DC but for much better prices, that's a winner. But if the quality is the same and the prices are the same, then what's the point? Give me something I can't already get.

Maybe that's not a fair way to rate restaurants, but the problem with Greenhouse Tavern is that the prices were as high as any restaurant I'd eat at in DC but the food wasn't good. Sorry, it just wasn't.

I ate here on a weeknight while in town on business. Walked in and was seated with no wait. Ordered a beer. 8 bucks. East coast pricing right off the bat. Not what I want when I'm in Cleveland. I opted for the lamb burger, since I wasn't especially hungry and didn't want a full entree. The burger was cooked to the right temperature, but bland. On the other hand, the fries that they served with it were PURE salt. Basically inedible because all you could taste was salt and judging from some other reviews, this was not an off-night; heavy salt is how they consistently serve their food. 

My first trip left a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figuratively) and I see no reason to go back and try one of the real entrees."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, great experience...

While in Cleveland on business recently, a group of nine of us decided to follow the advice of Bon Appetit and the New York Times, and try something different - The Greenhouse Tavern.

At first glance, the menu can be intimidating, and to some it can be just down right scary - pig's head, ox tail, and a bunch of items that many people may have never heard of.

We were delighted with our choice!  The wait staff is patient and understanding, and willing to explain any items, or provide a solid recommendation.

I even had the pig's head!  Delicious meat that came right off the bone - all the fixin's for some great pulled pork sandwiches.  Nice out-of-the-ordinary beer selection, great cocktails (try the Negroski with OYO Stone Fruit), delicious courses through the whole meal.

And, the food is all sourced locally as much a possible.  So, we had a great meal, helped support Ohio food, and had an overall awesome experience.

Definitely a must visit restaurant if you are in downtown Cleveland.  And remember, don't let the fancy menu scare you."}
{"text":"My party and I had reservations for 6 pm on a Saturday evening prior to seeing a show at the State Theatre. 3 of the 4 people in my party got beef or lamb burgers w/ fries and one got the cauliflower entree. Burgers were really good and flavorful with some innovative cheese options. Mine came with raclette cheese which I'd never heard of but was just a mild cow's milk variety. The fries were amazing with full cloves of garlic and rosemary mixed in. 

We opted for dessert since we had some time to kill and split the chocolate pretzel cake. Desserts are always overpriced but it was good, not too sweet and the salty pretzels were a good contrast in both flavor and texture.

Overall, a cute spot with cool decor. They have full size old school bicycles hanging on the wall with dim lighting."}
{"text":"I really wish I can give this place more stars. It's been on my list for a while now and it was quite a let down despite all the rave from friends. Came here with my gf on a weeknight and were seated at the bar since we didn't want to wait/have reservations.
The first thing you notice here is definitely the decor. There were walls covered by stacks of VHS tapes and various bicycles/parts scattered around. Rustic wood paneling accent the walls as well. An there was a large picture of a woman on the wall. Pretty hip I guess?...

Well it's get to the bad part... the food. We started with the beef pot au feu, we knew we were getting ourselves into something when the bartender warned us that it'll be small but it's also his favorite appetizer. Basically this appetizer is a small piece of beef tendon topped with ravioli shavings (they call this \"invisible\", which they aren't too far off) in \"beef\" broth. Although the tendon was tender it wasn't too flavorful, but the worst part is the broth. It was way too salty, the salt covered almost all of the flavor. Ramen packets make a better broth than this... For $10, this appetizer was a huge let down.
I ordered the pan fried pork chop while my girlfriend had the lamb burger. The chop was decent but could have been a lot more tender. It was a bit overcooked judging from the toughness of the meat. However, nothing was burnt, but there were parts that were too charred to eat (probably burnt sauce/marinade). The chop was wrapped in ham which at first I thought was bacon due to its crispy texture. The best part of this dish was definitely the mashed potatoes with scrapple and red eye gravy. The mash had a nice smokey taste and the gravy was quite savory. The lamb burger was pretty average according to my gf. 

Would I come back? maybe if I'm really in the mood to spend $50 on half a pig head (which is the staple here)"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a Gastropub and I was not disappointed. We were in Cleveland for the night and part of the next day when I looked up interesting places on Yelp and decided that we should try the GHT.

The place was packed but we were seated pretty quickly. The decor is eclectic with bicycles hanging from spots all over the walls and ceiling and a mural over the wall around the bar. 

To start I had a tasty dish of local turnips with a curry sauce and crispy shallots and a cocktail that I called liquid candy- the GHT Smartees! (yes, that's an exclamation mark). This all made me very happy. For an entree, I had what I believe was called Fried Air- a sheep's milk cheese that had been fried and resembled a fried mozzarella, except that it was sheep's milk. It was very filling. My husband had some issues with his pork saltimbocca only because he needed it cooked more to his liking- though it should be said that it was not undercooked, it was more of a preference. 

Overall, it was a great restaurant experience in an unfamiliar city and that's all you can ask for."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern is a culinary delight. The food there is let's just say, out of the ordinary, but in a good way! The atmosphere is amazing, east 4th street is one of the best parts of downtown Cleveland. It's basically like a closed down street party. The restaurant itself is very trendy and the service is great. The frites are amazing! I took a huge chance and ordered the roasted pig head, and it was a food adventure to say the least. Pretty amazing to see, and more amazing to experience the taste. It was delicious. I have had other items on the menu, burgers are really good, and the salads are as well. Everything is creatively prepared to give your tastebuds a delight. A perfect place to go when the weather is warm outside. Very cool rooftop deck as well. The greenhouse tavern is definitely a place to put on your to do list if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I just ate at Greenhouse Tavern for the first time less than an hour ago. I literally just walked in the door, but I feel so passionately about the experience I just had there, I need to immediately post a review about it. 

The meal I just ate at Jonathan Sawyer's Greenhouse Tavern was singlehandedly the most disappointing meal I've had for quite some time. Now, I really try to not write negative reviews. I'm not some bitter old women sitting at home alone with her 59 cats just looking for ways to ruin other people's day. Usually when I have a bad experience I just sort of brush it off and move on. This time though I really feel like I owe it to my other Clevelanders to give an honest review. Especially for such a highly regarded restaurant. 

I had the Acorn Squash Confit. It sounded amazing. Sure, it was vegetarian and vegan so you always risk that maybe it won't be full flavored like some of the other more raved about meat dishes, but I figured for a restaurant that boasted and stressed that they had options for everyone and any food restriction I was sure I wouldn't be disappointed. And for $24 surely this was a meal worth writing home about. I was wrong. My meal was bland, flavorless, and completely lacking in complexity and creativity. I genuinely am not exaggerating when I say my meal was a flavorless steamed acorn squash and some bland black beans tossed on top. It wasn't seasoned at all: no salt, no pepper, nothing. Literally my dish was completely void of flavor. 

My boyfriend and I eat downtown so rarely, I had been looking forward to this meal for weeks. We got a hotel room downtown and everything to really have a memorable experience. Needless to say, I won't be forgetting this \"experience\", but for all the wrong reasons. Last time we did this we went to Pura Vida and were blown away. Obviously next time we will be returning. I should have known better. 

I expected so much more from a Jonathan Sawyer restaurant, but after this I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Loved the place, the food, ambiance and service. 
I went with my bhusband for dinner. 
we started with the bread board, it is HUGE! but it is delicious. Definitely more than two people can eat. The spread and butters are amazing. 

We had the risotto which was delicious, make sure you have enough time, they cook most everything from scratch. 

My husband had the pork chops. Three different styles and all great and tender. 

All the food is local and fresh. You can taste it. 

make sure you check out the kitchen, you can have dinner there or just go down to take a look. Cool place"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best place for vegans-although they offer a few options, the ones I tried were very disappointing, especially from a James beard award winning chef. To start I had the pea tartar which, although fresh, was lacking heavily in the flavor department. For my next course I ordered one of my favorite foods on earth-Brussels sprouts. I was so excited when they arrived, those little orbs of deliciousness,unfortunately these had the exact opposite problem from the peas-they were overly seasoned. Worse yet, they were so incredibly sweet. The sauce the sprouts were doused in were so sugary it made my mouth pucker. To end with, I had the one petite four that was vegan, a small chocolate cube. This turned out to be another of my favorite foods they completely ruined. It tasted like gelatinous, artificially flavored chocolate. To be fair, my date ordered the five course, nonvegan, tasting menu and loved it. His entree, the pork chop, was one of his favorite dishes our whole time in cleveland. Like I said, this review is specifically for vegans, or those opting for one of the vegan items on the menu. If you want Brussels sprouts, try the ones at provenance inside the museum of art."}
{"text":"I'll go 3.5 stars.  I had the chicken wings confit.  They were pretty tasty.  Before I could order anything else I got a complimentary order of Tabasco chicken.    Both chicken dishes were pretty good.  The service I got at the bar was pretty good.  I kick down the half star just from observation.  A lot of the wait staff would come to the bar to place drink orders and didn't know much about the drinks they were serving (eg. Do we infuse the tequila here or is it brought in?).  Seems like that should be known before you send someone into the wild.  :-).  I'm here on business, so this is a first impression.  I might go back, but nothing made me think I have to go back to try anything else.  We'll see!"}
{"text":"We each had the chefs tasting.
They started us off with a spoonful of hummus with red pepper and lemon zest. While tasty, it was not exactly inspired, seasonal, or local. Also later that evening we saw the chef stick a spoon in and taste them- double dipping in the process. Gross.
The green pea tartar was interesting and seasonal- pretty good, but not amazing. We both really enjoyed the jeky plate.
The clams with foie gras was AMAZING, and I am not a big sea food fan. It came with delicious bread and it had tons of sauce for sopping- we licked that plate clean.
The wings were just wings like you could get at any bar. Totally mediocre and uninteresting. My husband had read that they were a big favorite, so he really wanted to try them. They were nothing special at all. I wish I had gotten the gnocchi with green peas and ramps instead- seasonal and fresh. Oh well.
The pork chop was delicious and perfectly cooked but WAY too salty, and I generally like a lot of salt on my food.
The lamb rigatoni was really nice. I loved the rhubarb sauce on it.  A delicious offering I highly recommend.
The buttered popcorn pot de creme was really delicious. It hadn't set up all the way, but the flavor was perfect.
The chocolate soufflé was a huge disappointment. It tasted like a heavy chocolate brownie cake with raspberry flavoring and the creme anglaise served with it was like a little cup of sweetened skim milk with a hint of stout. Not good.
The service wasn't great either- the waitress who took our order was good, but the food runners brought all the courses out without removing empty plates and nobody checked on us after we placed our order.
They play crappy classic rock too. 
My husband thinks of it as \"elevated bar food\"-this description would also apply to Lola.
If you want fun ambience and people watching, go to Greenhouse Tavern. If you want a really special meal, go to the Blue Door in Cuyahoga Falls- really delicious, beautiful, fresh, and inspired food."}
{"text":"This is one of our usual favorite places ever, lately we've been disappointed. This past Saturday night we took family that were in from out of town. To start, the drunks at the next table should have been flagged since they were leaving the table to buy drinks at the bar. Serving drunks is a real liability for restaurants. We asked for bread, which arrived with a spread. The runner didn't know what was in the spread. The usually great lamb burgers were undercooked and over salted. Service was really slow, too. This was our second bad meal here recently. What's going on? Is the kitchen and front of house getting the attention it needs from the chef to maintain the standards we are used to?"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and an interesting take on food. There are so many cool little facts about how Greenhouse does their thing too. Just ask the waiters for some info and they will rattle off some neat facts about the place and their ideology. 

The food itself is pretty good too. I started with a rye Manhattan of course and it was great. Probably one of the better ones you can get downtown. Just an FYI
I was there with my date and we opted for the chef's tasting menu and I highly recommend it. The portions are just right and you can try a little of everything. The waiters really help with the recommendations too. For the courses I did the following:

1. Fish and chips dip- tangy, and fishy great starter!
2. Fifth Quarter- smoked salmon on bread with tartar. Salmon was great the bread and tartar sat too long and it was soggy and overpowering. Not cool
3. Market fish- tasty not overdone and the taters were amazing!
4. A very merry unbirthday cake- a little grownups dream. Imagine a Bday cake from heaven

I had a great time here and there was definitely more to do here. I hear you should buy a round for the crew!"}
{"text":"Should be much better, as there seem to be pretty good places on this small strip. Asked for a beer in the Newcastle Nut brown ale family, and he gave me an IPA. With authority. Missus ordered a lamb burger, our dining mate ordered a flank steak, both medium, and both came out Very well done. You know that thing where a server says \"how is everything?\", and you've been waiting so long for the food that you're just happy to be eating, even if they screwed up your order, so you just say, \"great, thanks\", because you'll be damned if you're gonna wait another 40 minutes for them to get it right? That was pretty much our experience here."}
{"text":"Food is decent, however service was very poor on the rooftop bar. Ordered two Oban's on the roof top bar after dinner in the main restaurant downstairs. Menu listed the price at $13 each. When I got the check it was for over $56! 

I was told that the price was doubled as the bar tender \"assumed\" I ordered a double pour! It wasn't a double pour by any means. I however paid up without making a fuss but would caution other people to avoid the roof top bar and clarify the pricing of drinks when ordering regardless of what they list on the printed menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with great recommendations. Good selection of beer and top notch food."}
{"text":"I have been to the GHT too many times to count and each time the service was excellent.  They are very knowledgable about the food they serve, the drinks they sling, and they are quite attentive.  

I usually end up with the steak Tartare, it's my go-to meal at GHT, and it's outstanding. I have had other meals there such as the Pigs Head, which is meaty, super flavorful, and the presentation is spot on.  

Pricing is reasonable, you do not get this quality, in the food, or  in the staff for cheap."}
{"text":"Food awesome!  Service even better!  Love this place.  Always a good time."}
{"text":"Wholly mother of God ... The animal frittes is a gargantuan portion of fries and gravey and course mustard and two eggs and greatness!!!!  Oh and the cheese .....

Came intending to try the pork chop
...there's no way now.  The fries are enough for 8 easily and every bite delicious!!!

Once again, great food at this destination spot.  Packed for a wednesday, but they still found a way to seat a group of unreserved who had show tickets and needed to get in and out.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Always such a wonderful experience at Greenhouse!  I no longer live in Cleveland, but on my frequent visits, Greenhouse is a must stop for either lunch or dinner.  I have loved every single dish I have ever had, and always look forward to swinging through to see what's new on the menu.  The service is on point, and the staff is always super knowledgeable-- which as  we all know can make or break a dining experience.  The bar scene is super friendly and the cocktail and wine offering seem to be updated frequently to stay on trend and season-- also super yummy!!  Yeah-- I dont really have anything bad to say-- a must stop while in CLE!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and overrated food!
My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on May 24 for dinner. He was very excited to try their wings. We sat outside and waited for our server. This took at least 10 minutes and finally had to ask who was taking care of us. We ordered the wings to start. When they came out, there was a clean bone in the bowl that appeared like someone had already eaten one. Gross. 
For dinner my boyfriend ordered the pork and I ordered a salad. 30 minutes later and our food still hadn't arrived and our server continued to be very inattentive. We were sick of waiting and asked for it to go. My bfs $30 meal barely had any food and my salad was about 5 pieces of spinach. $70 later and we were pissed and wanted to leave. We were still upset on the drive home and I called and spoke to the manager and nicely explained our experience. I let him know we had been there before and the food and service is usually great. He was very professional and said he'd be happy to make it up to us and asked for my address to send us something in the mail.
It's been almost a month later and we have received nothing. 
The food is overrated, over priced, and the service was absolutely terrible. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"A fun environment. Dinner a service was good. We had beef tartar appetizer, which included a nice side of fries. Celery root risotto had unusual flavors but it grew on us. We had Pork n Pie entree and it was enough for 2 of us after the appetizers. It was a little salty but the sweet apple pie filling included in the dish created a nice balance. Overall we spent about $30 per person plus drinks."}
{"text":"Super cool.  We had a giant party of 40 and those are a huge headache for servers but all of them took it in stride and went out of their way to made us at home.  

Besides that the food was quite spectacular.  BBQ Donuts, Popcorn Carmel Flan and entrees that all looked amazing.  

The drinks are really fantastic with a very knowledgeable bartender.  He was open to experiment and I even tasted their on-site barrel aged booze.  

The event is not complete with out a serving of Kitchen Coffee.  For $10, they give you a tray of beer that you get to take down to the kitchen staff.  You ring the bell and they freak-out because you bought them a round of beer after their shift is done."}
{"text":"Forget the smell of stale beer a la a frat dorm.   Forget the negative ambiance.  And forget the dirty floor.   Because days later you'll still vividly remember the undersized portions, the oversized prices, the salt-laden fries, and the tough, over-cooked burgers.  

The fish of the day was good, though.  But for $32 you can get so much more and better for less very near by."}
{"text":"I've been to Greenhouse Tavern countless times over the years and it's consistently outstanding... top-notch food, great service, and a welcoming space that suits any occasion.  Recently, they even put together a customized meal focused around peas for me a friend that love peas!  From pea tartar, to pea \"mashed potatoes\", and even a pea/ginger puree in the dessert. So much fun, and delicious as always.  Can't wait to see what they come up with next!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place is WAY overrated. I know I'm supposed to like the exotic menu because it's the hip thing to do, but the food is average at best. Kale salad was just ok. Burgers were nothing special at all. Gnocchi wasn't great. The fries, however, are very good. A nice twist with rosemary and garlic. The worst part is their homemade ketchup which tastes nothing like ketchup. Throw in lousy service by our waiter (and I know these things happen but this guy was especially poor and inattentive), and this really was a bad experience."}
{"text":"This was my third trip to GHT. 

I'd put GHT in the category of \"Very Good\" restaurants.  I enjoy the food and beverages, but they're not mind blowing / life changing.  Even the more challenging dining options are just on the tip of being amazing, but it's just not quite there.  

I'm still very big on GHT. It's a place that must be visited. I'm continually impressed by the smaller plates over the mains.  Things like the Brussels Sprouts, confit wings,  and  Animal Frites are really solid and flavorful. My favorite visit has included the rooftop bar, (on those few sunny Cleveland summer days), with drafts and some of the best fried chicken in Cleveland."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites whether it's lunch or dinner!!! Lamb burger and and of the fries are amazing.  And no, these aren't your average fries trust me.  You have to try them to understand.  The menu is cool, a variety of choices from the safe to the daring.  The chef/owners have thought of every detail here yo make this one of Cleveland's more interesting spots.  Have had several dishes but I hope to try e everything eventually!  Places like this, not pretentious or overly pricey, but outstanding are what keeps Cleveland's restaurant scene evolving.

Ohhh, and I forgot about the wings..prepared confit style. Essentially cooked in fat at a slow temp, these wings are definitely a \"cheat\" meal...but wow are they worth it!!!"}
{"text":"It seems nowadays $$$ is inversely proportionate to food portions. Greenhouse Tavern is no exception. The main pasta dish I ordered, I finished in probably 6 big bites. 6 bites. 24 dollars. That's 4 dollars a bite, not including tax and tip. 

The food quality was 3 stars at best. PERIOD. We came as a group of 6 and almost everyone ordered something different, so fortunately I could try a variety of dishes.

Appetizers (Devils on horseback) was bacon wrapped dates. This was actually pretty good. Portion sizes are 3 bacon wrapped dates (each date is the size of a large grape). 4 stars.

Burger was 17 bucks and it certainly was not by a long shot anything special. The fries were also quite mediocre. Yes, it was roasted/fried with rosemary. Yes, it came with an aioli sauce, but HALF of the fries were NOT WHOLE FRIES but these little stubs that were overcooked. 

Going back to the pasta (for the life of me I cant remember the name), it was actually pretty good, but again, nothing special. 

So why does this review have 3 stars? Because when we complained about a dish the manager came up and resolved the problem ASAP. Extremely friendly staff and responsible manager. The waiters were fast and efficient. Food came up quickly (it was 3/4 full on a Wed night) and our checks were done quickly as well.

Conclusion: 3 stars.

Would I ever go there by myself. Absolutely never. But with a date or a group of friends before a concert or a show in the theater district? Yea, probably. But I am sure as heck eating beforehand and not throwing 24 bucks away for a dish that does not fill you up."}
{"text":"This place is quite an experience. The inside decor is just as hipster as the menu is. Back when we went, they had a \"bread plate\" as a starter. This was a selection of breads with 6 sauces, many of which were created that morning by the chefs in the kitchen. Some were great and others (like the juniper one) not so much. But it was fun to try them all out, and the bread was of excellent quality. I remember ordering the Ohio Lamb Burger, which was a delight to sink my teeth into. The fries which it came with were also pretty great. I love that the food is all sourced locally, and the quirky servers will make your dining experience memorable. If you're willing to drop some cash for a great dinner, head to Greenhouse!"}
{"text":"A restaurant shouldn't have to try THIS hard...right?

I've been here a few times now and each time the menu leaves me wanting more for the money Im plunking down.  More often than not, the dishes are not that great.  

First off...the menu.  I know its really trendy now for \"gastropubs\" to make these insanely complicated takes on traditional food, like a burger, but it really really shouldn't take me 20mins to read the menu, trying to figure out JUST what it is I am ordering.  
Its in english and yet I feel like its in Greek or something.  Maybe Im just stupid, but the dishes seem more complicated than they need to be; overwrought, contrived, and strained. 

The actual food, after all that energy spent on writing a menu with too many descriptions, is bland and quite uninteresting.  The burgers I've had there are not very flavorful, the salads boring.  The 2 things I've really liked there were the Pig's head, and the frites, with garlic aioli.  Both are done very well and deserve the $$$ they ask for.  Everything else, meh.

I give a point to the wait staff though.  They are nice and very attentive, and I can imagine its not easy working at a restaurant where you may need to explain the entire menu to each and every customer."}
{"text":"I may not be late to the Greenhouse Tavern love show, but I am guilty of never trying one of their most popular menu items until now. 

Those wings. Those glorious, fall-off-the-bone, tender-as-all-hell while still crispy, spicy, tangy, perfect wings. WHY?! Why did it take me so long to taste what is now possibly my favorite food on the face of the planet? I shake my fist at you, self! 

But now I know--and I know hard--just how important these wings are to my happiness. I stood at a crowded Greenhouse Tavern bar to have these, no seats, just a dirty martini and these little nuggets of perfection. 

If you love this restaurant, if you've never been here, or if you have to travel hours to get here, just try those wings. The flavors are all balanced in a way that even people who hate spicy foods or wings would fall victim to their persuasive, delicious charm. And if you ever visit Greenhouse ANd they're out of these bad boys? I would not judge you for shedding a tear. I would join you and wallow in that sadness. That is, until I picked one of the many other delectable items from their menu to indulge in. 

Thank you for making the world a better place, GHT."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern is a very interesting restaurant that I've never quite seen replicated anywhere else. It is a VERY hipster place, so be prepared for that going in. Many of the items on the menu were things I had either never heard of or never tried before. That said, that's NOT a bad thing. Their breads were very good, and the time we went, they were experimenting with a bunch of new jams and butters. Some were delicious, and some were a little bizarre, but I loved the concept that the chef had just whipped something new up and was trying it out for the first time. The food was quite tasty, and the portions were pretty good too. The decor was lovely - the whole place prides itself on being local, and the very restaurant itself exudes that. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from the Greenhouse Tavern and I am more than an occasional patron (sarcasm).  Their happy hour menu is one of the best in town (which includes a late night option on Fridays & Saturdays, and only served at the bar).  The wings are fantastic, lamb burger equally so.  While they only have usually three beers on tap, their bottle and can selection is outstanding.  

Only reason I can't give it a five star rating is that there can be a slight element of inconsistency.  Not typical, but definitely present.  

Oh also, the rooftop patio gets five stars all day.  One of the best places to drink in Cleveland on nice days (the few that we get)."}
{"text":"I think the appetizers (firsts and seconds on the menu) are the stars of the show at Greenhouse Tavern. 

Some of my group got the chef's tasting menu for $39 (choose your four courses) and we all shared a lot of the apps. The crispy chicken wings, braised lamb and devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates with bitter chocolate) were all fantastic.  I had the Steak Frites for dinner which was also good but those appetizers were just so memorable. 

They carry different flavors of Jeni's Ice Creams from Columbus on their menu which I love after being in Cbus the last four years. 

On a somewhat unrelated note we had a great table for people watching on the second floor by the window. We watched a drunk girl totally face plant in a mud puddle during dinner. The police officer came over to chat with her as she continued to accidentally rip flowers out of the flower box while trying to stand up. There are some interesting things to watch on East 4th I suppose. 

Great place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service and phenomenal food make for a very enjoyable experience. The cheese and bread board is a great way to start the meal and will definitely satisfy a table of four. A solid dining establishment."}
{"text":"I ate an early dinner here while in town for business. about 5pm on a hot Monday in August. 
I sat at the bar and the staff was friendly and attentive.
I asked for recommendations for a vegetarian, and one bartender said that the veggie burger was good, even for a carnivore - so I ordered it. It was made with rice and beans and beets, among other things, and as he stated, looked more like a rare hamburger than a dull grey veggie burger. It was delicious - my only complaints are more sauce, more veggies, and make it a bit crisper - but it was different and good. The salad that came with it was unique - baby greens with thin \"fresh pickled\" cucumbers, inion and a delicious stoneground mustard vinaigrette.
They have some different items on the menu I'm not used to seeing - tartar, and \"Cleveland Caviar\" - so I chatted with the bartenders about what is in these dishes.
They have some unique beers on tap, and their drink of the day (week?) was some concoction with beer, fresh fruit, soda, vodka - I ordered one, and it was GOOD!

if I ever go to Cleveland again, I would try this place again."}
{"text":"First of all, I can really get behind a restaurant that spends a significant amount of time on their beer list and the bartenders can walk the talk with classic mixed drinks.  We've been there several times and the kitchen is consistent and well above average.  Service isn't fast, but it is predictable and the waitstaff is very accommodating.  The menu, and especially the four course chef's tasting menu are reasonable.  Foie Gras steamed clams were 'last meal' delicious and both the Roasted Pig Head and Whole Beef Shin were unbelievable.  

In comparison to neighbor Lola, a party of four can sample over 50% of the menu and still walk out paying significantly less.  The atmosphere is much more casual, the food comparable, and the snob and wide-eyed tourist factor is significantly lower."}
{"text":"Great place in downtown Cleveland. I enjoyed dinner at the bar, confit chicken wings and beet salad...both were superb. The wings had great crunch and a nice unique flavor with vinegar. Service was very attentive with multiple bartenders working."}
{"text":"Served the wrong dressing with my order & with my dates order as well. Server noticed & promptly fixed part of the mistake.. She forgot to bring one of the new salads to replace the one with the wrong dressing but she did bring a new dressing for the other. Enjoyed my veggie burger without cheese & with the vegan whole wheat bun... & added some white vinegar to it. The vinegar came with my salad. Gave it the extra kick of flavor it needed. Not enough raw vegan options for me to stop in again but I was pleased w my meal!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I do admit it's a bit expensive, but they also use high quality ingredients. The drink menu is amazing, with a ton of beer options. I have been here a few times just for drinks, but only once for dinner. 

The service was great and our glasses were always full, which is impressive because I drink alot of water. The food arrived quickly even though they were packed, and everything tasted fresh. We got the bread board to start, which was phenomenal and I highly recommend. My friend and I both got burgers- her the Ohio beef and me the rice and bean- and we both really enjoyed them, especially the fries that came with. 

It's not best best restaurant I've every been to, but its definitely my favorite in downtown Cleveland. Also, beware it gets really crowded on weekends, especially on game nights."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland and happened to stumble upon this place.  The chicken wings were unbelievably good!! Probably the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time when my boyfriend's parents were visiting. We were seated on the first floor in the back of the restaurant. It was still really light out for dinner but the area we sat in was so dark. I get having mood lighting, but it was way too dark to even see our menus or admire our food. 
We ordered a bunch of the popular menu items including the hominy, pomme frites, barrel aged tobasco fried chicken, fred flintstone beef shortrib, and roasted pig head. 
I don't think the hominy is on the menu anymore but I would order this appetizer over and over- crispy, salty and super tasty. The fried chicken definitely had a kick to it and was very juicy. The beef short rib was my favorite dish. Came out on a huge decadent platter. It was tender, fall off the bone goodness that was soaked in lots of flavor.  The roasted pig head was interesting and more of a visual wow factor than anything else. I don't think it was worth the price in flavor but definitely impressive to see a whole pig face in the middle of the table.

I've also come here multiple times to hang out on the roof top that overlooks East 4th. This area feels much more casual and chill. Good drink selections and a nice place to hang out after work. I will be coming back to Greenhouse Tavern rooftop as long as the weather holds up but would probably skip the restaurant. The food was just OK for the price and the ambiance was just not inviting, especially if you are seated in the dark corner of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with two people and we ordered every single item on the firsts and seconds. Then we ordered our individual entrees and desserts. They had to pull over two extra patio tables, but it was worth it. My brother ordered the pig head and people stopped to take pictures of it. I  had no room for more food, but gave it the old college try and ordered the steak. Compared to the culinary tour we were on with the firsts and seconds, the steak was unremarkable. That aside, I enjoyed the Greenhouse very much and I recommend it because it's not just dinner--they did a very good job of making it an experience.

The service was wonderful, although I can't speak too much of it because the people I were with are very good friends with the server.  With that, I'm not sure how it would have been had we been strangers."}
{"text":"I do have a good time when I go here. The drinks and food are fun and local. It seems a bit pricey for what you get, but sometimes that is alright. There are some spectacular dishes and drinks, but also a few that fall a bit flat. Definitely give it a try, but it may depend on the day, or your mood."}
{"text":"Seems going to great, but if you're going to serve bottle beer, treat it like draft and serve cold glasses.  You're pouring away the selections' positive aspects with dish-water warm glasses."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I visited this place for dinner, service was very accommodating. I feel like this place may have been a bit over rated :(. Anyway, it has a very interesting feeling--- seems like it may have formerly been a book store? I loved the style though. The pork chop was my least favorite, the flavor was there it was just not moist enough. Idk maybe I'm just too picky. However, the drink YES YA'AM was something else. It blew my mind! I strongly recommend it, only if you're into sweetness. Otherwise you should try their blueberry cider. Super yummy also!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Thought they were something like I've never had before. Great beer selection also."}
{"text":"\"People love us on Yelp\" and \"People hate us on Yelp\"--those stickers, both set out on the Greenhouse Tavern window, pretty much sum it up for me.  As I've written previously, there is so much I dislike about GT:  the lunch is far short of inspiring, the level of service is below expectations, the commitment to locally produced stuff severely limits their drink choices, and they treat their dinner reservations system like a joke.  On the other hand, some of the dishes they serve up are really tremendous:  The Roasted Pig's Head is fantastic.

Add to that list the \"40 Clove\" Heirloom Garlic Roasted 1/2 Chicken--basically, half a chicken roasted inside a bread with garlic and herbs.  A dish with not a lot of complexity and a lead time of 45 minutes to boot, but the result is an incredibly moist cut of herb-infused chicken.  It was definitely worth the extra wait, especially when you pass the time sharing a full bowl serving of the . . .

Foie Gras Steamed Clams.  Certainly not as good as the chicken, and the clams themselves are just decent, but the highlight of the dish for me was the sauce--combining the butter, clams, and foie gras in a mix that you dip into with your grilled bread.

I'm still sticking with my other comments in prior reviews, but when a place can string together a few really outstanding dishes, it deserves a bump up."}
{"text":"Had the pigs head. The first half inch under the skin was fat, my stomach is still queazy. The half head was $48 but it fed 3 of us. Had a clam app and a wing app. Both superb. I would say you should go, get a steak and a couple apps and you're gonna enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"After a few bad meals at Table 45 while visiting Cleveland, we decided to jump in  a taxi from the Cleveland Clinic and go to this place.   Am I glad we did since the meal and the ambiance was great.

Between my selection of the tasting menu (only $37 which is a steal) and everything else that the other guests had, there wasnt a bad thing on the menu.

The Goat Cheese and bread was super flavorful and tasty, the chicken wings were so crispy and had a great sliced jalapeno topping, the ponme frites with mozzarella and gravy were flavorful and rich, and then to cap it off the oxtail ragu was delectable with a rich sauce and small croutons to enhance its texture.    The other people had the Fish of the day (Flounder) which supposedly was amazing and the Steak Frite which looked like a perfect steak.

Next time, I would try the clams and also for the adventurous, the Pomme Frites Animal Style.   Those arent even on the menu...

Enjoy."}
{"text":"I was in \"hangry\" by the time I arrived at The Greenhouse. We ordered a big variety of dishes (including the confit wings so throughly raved about on Yelp) and some drinks (no beers or alcohol with this crew) and prepared ourselves for an adventure. 

I can't say enough good things about the animal style frites: perfectly salty and the lardons of bacon were to die for. The wings were a disappointment. I thought they had lazy preparation. The confit cooking method left them falling off the bones, but the sauce was thinly applied and poorly distributed. 

My favorite dish of the day was my entree of beef tartare. If you're a fan of tartare dishes, do not miss this one. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I went for my daughter's 30th birthday. Two of my ( adult) children got food poisoning. They were violently ill for 5 days. I called to let them know as soon as we confirmed it was food poisoning to let them know so we could try to prevent this horrible problem from happening to another innocent person. One of my daughter's had this confirmed in the hospital. Not only did they not offer to refund our money ( which I did not bother to ask for) but they really did not seem too concerned. Their very uncaring attitutde was such a disappointment . So, good luck if you eat there. My family gets upset just walking by this place."}
{"text":"It's simple - I love Greenhouse! 

Greenhouse Tavern has a wonderful set of options that creates an exciting culinary experience.  I would recommend doing the fixed price menu which allows you to sample from each of the course offerings - it's fabulous!  Best of all, they don't rush you through your meal, and the ambiance serves as a great place to go with a group to enjoy the evening.  

Best three things out of what I've sampled so far:
1) Organic American Proscuitto w/ pain frit
2) Goat Cheese Tart
3) Egg Frites

No matter what you get, I would recommend pairing it with their house-made port punch."}
{"text":"Tasty, eco-friendly fare on the nicest/cutest street in Cleveland -- East 4th. 

We went for lunch, but got there at 4 pm (after lunch, but before dinner), so we ended up ordering off of the happy hour menu: 

Amazing truffle fries, succulent grass-fed burgers, and a few creative side dishes (interesting marinated olives, this weird but compelling almond dish, etc.).

The preparations are stark--not a whole lot of ingredients or layers, but really, really good, and always with a nice, though often subtle, splash of ingenuity, like a topping of fresh fried eggs on our fries. 

Great atmosphere, great food. Good for a variety of occasions: it would work equally well for a business lunch, a first date, a post-game after party, or a happy hour rendezvous with the guys (or girls).

Go for its interesting, eco-friendly menu, and the great ambiance of E. 4th."}
{"text":"Visited cleveland with the wife for one night and made sure we had dinner at the greenhouse tavern.  First of all, some of the best service we have ever experienced, extremely welcoming and attentive.  My wife and I shared the jerky plate and broccolini salad, both were excellent.  For the main course we shared the pig head entree.  Some of the best pork I have had in my life.  It was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the meat along with the flavors from the glaze was amazing.  It reminded me of pulled pork but more tender and flavorful meat.  Highly recommend this spot for a great meal in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"When I saw that they had roasted pig head here, I had to check it out. This place was awesome.  The pig head did not disappoint. The sauce really set it off. The meat feel from the bone. The drinks were pretty good too. They have some tasty coctails and beers. The place is a bit on the pricey side so just keep that in mind when visiting.  I knew it ahead of time and it did not bother me.  The service here was pretty good too. The place is pretty big inside, but you can easily pass it on the outside. It is on the main downtown Cleveland strip where all the restaurant/bars are located.  This is definitely a must visit if you are in Cleveland. And if you are not up for the pig head, i heard that the clams, and wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"been twice and both times were a home run. perfect gastropub menu with excellent service. the chef delivers in a big way and hey... the clams with foie? just order it and thank me later. you're welcome..."}
{"text":"Awesome night here on Saturday! Had no clue there was even a rooftop bar here even after having dined here on several occasions. The scenery was nice and the crowd was very mellow. So happy to have chosen Greenhouse over anywhere on west 25th or west 6th. Also BEST WINGS EVER!!"}
{"text":"It's amazing that one thing can ruin an otherwise mediocre experience.

For the food - the reviews are correct - AWESOME WINGS! I'm not much of a meat eater, but the wings were by far the best thing I had all night. The dates are pretty good as well.

If you are planning on ordering vegetarian here, get the black bean burger (just avoid the duck fat fried french fries) for a decent meal. The cassoulet is an embarrassment to this restaurant, and Cleveland as a whole.

Finally, don't expect great service. Our waitress was average at best, and had the nerve to take my father's trust on recommending a bottle of wine to get herself a nice fat (already included in the gratuity) tip. Lesson learned - next time look at the prices rather than trusting a waitress to behave ethically. For that one reason, my family will never be back to this otherwise 4-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good food, but expensive in my opinion. We split the following...

Braised Meatball w/ house made ricotta, rose veal sweetbreads, pork sausage & brioche bread.

Stuffed Semolina Pasta perogi style w/ new potato, romanesco cauliflower, local goat's milk ricotta, garum, capers, prune, pecorino & brown butter.

Crispy Chicken Wings Confit w/ roasted jalapeño, lemon juice, scallion & garlic.

Buttered Popcorn Pot de Crème: caramel - sea salt.

All delicious and I wish the portions were larger. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved everything about this restaurant!!! The atmosphere, service, knowledgable waitress, the food, drink choices, it was all amazing :) I cannot wait to return"}
{"text":"Was expecting a vegetarian restaurant- but very wrong. Although they cater to vegetarians, they are BIG on animal product. One of the dishes was pig head and potatoes- really? The workers were clearly unhappy to be working at 11am on a Sunday. My dish was over cooked and likely sitting for some time. 

HOWEVER, my husbands dish was fabulous! He got the kielbasa hash with this delicious Fresno pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant. Stopped by for date night with my boyfriend. The wings were delicious and left us drooling for more. We shared the pork chops which were bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. Cocktails were equally delicious and a treat."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Tried a few different appetizers. The brusselsprouts and the chicken wings confet. Both were out of this world!!! Someone else at my table did the cauliflower, that was not so good. For an entree, I did the skirt steak medium rare... ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!! Would highly recommend this place. And it's in a cool area with a lot of other bars and restaurants. Would definitely recommend! Service was good"}
{"text":"Always good service and is good for a variety of diets. Knowledgable staff that is also friendly. Menu changes often yet they have done staples that never leave like the pot de creme. 

Only blah thing about this place is the location.  East Fourth ain't one my favorite place for many reasons."}
{"text":"Love the greenhouse! The specialty cocktails make you feel fancy. We got the pig head..Who does that?! How original! Oh and also delicious!"}
{"text":"Well, we ate there tonight before we saw Rent.  The four of us were very excited because it has been good before...  not tonight... the starters were the best and they came luke warm.  The food was probably some of the saltiest food I have ever had and that is a statement from me (I like salt).  Four of us spent over $400 on dinner and left disappointed...  really put a wet blanket on our night... don't eat here... there are so many other places with better food for the money."}
{"text":"I can only assume the lunch chef is not quite up to par with the dinner chef because wholly salt lick was it salty. I spent most of the time I was eating deciding if my sandwich was supposed to be hot or cold as it was room temperature. I can say I do believe it wasn't cooked right based on how ill I felt the rest of the day. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was a cool place and our waitress was awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok, first I have to say that I chose this place because I admire their commitment to pesticide-free local produce.  

I took my girlfriend here last night for Valentine's Day and we went all out.  We ordered the turnips first, and they were perfectly cooked.  A little crunch on the outside and bursted flavor when you got to the inside of them.  Absolutely great. Basically, it went downhill from there.  I absolutely can't stand over-salted food.  Everything was over salted, and there was no release from it in any of the dishes we ordered. While the raw Kohlrabi salad and the turnips were not OVER salted per se, they were spiced as such to inhibit the wonderful natural flavor of the produce they are using.  Which brings me to my next point:  if you are using such high quality fresh local produce such as this, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO MUCH TO IT.  Add a little oil here and there, a tiny bit of spice will do, and let the natural flavors speak for themselves. 

Additional things we ordered were the duck meatball soup, the 40 spice chicken, ceasar salad and the gravy fries.  The best we had were the gravy fries, which should have automatically come with ketchup to compliment the slight bitterness or the gravy and the creaminess of the mozzarella.  It was PERFECT with the ketchup.  I ordered the ceasar salad at the end because everything was so salty and needed something fresh to finish the meal.  However, the lettuce was absolutely soaked in this dressing which was very very salty.  I would rate the salad disgusting.  This sort of tilted this meal from OK to 'ok, but not worth the money and not coming back.'    

Again, I love the concept of the restaurant, and I hope the owner/chef read this review so they can lay off the salt.  It really did ruin the integrity of most of the flavors of the dishes, and took away any potential for flavor complexity.  I will most likely not be going back unfortunately.  I am not one of those people out to get a restaurant for nitpicky details, and I really went in wanting to like what they had to offer."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner today and decided to get the restaurant week menu. We informed our server that we are vegetarians and he recommended that we should get the buttermilk kale salad for starters and then should try their rice bean burger and Bean Farrotto for our entree. We did that and we were so glad! 

The salad was served with their home made bread. It was definitely the best kale salad that I've ever had. Period. So good and healthy! I really wanted the recipe so i can make it at home every day, but i knew they wouldn't share it! 

Next was our entree, I got the rice bean burger and had the chance to taste Bean Farrotto as well. I loved the bean burger, it was very delicious. Bean Farrotto was definitely yummy and spicy but it sat in a pool of oil. I loved the taste of it but would not order it again as it won't be so waist friendly.

Finally, for dessert they served us buttered popcorn pot de creme. I had my doubts about this , when it was served but they quickly disappeared when i had my first spoonful. It had a caramel sea salt topping and it was quite scrumptious! Over all we loved our meal but my boy felt that the portion sizes were more on the smaller end. (He eats a lot, so he wasn't quite full until he had half of my dessert!) - Over all, it was great. I wish they made the portions a little bigger. 

Service - was fine. Our server took the orders and did a rush check in - did not really stop and ask too much about the meal. Not a big deal - but just wanted to mention it!"}
{"text":"Typically, this place is awesome.  Cool atmosphere, tremendous food, awesome rooftop bar in the summer. But I went for lunch today and got the fish po boy and it was terrible.  Barely any fish on it - maybe the size of my pinky finger on an 8\" bun (which was a bit dry). I legitimately thought the fish fell out on the way to the table, except that another person in my group ordered it and his was the same as mine.  I only give a 3 star review because of the gravy frites app is enough to make up for just about anything. But I expected better of GHT."}
{"text":"I hate to spoil all the great reviews, but I have to tell you that I have eaten at A LOT of hyped up restaurants but never have I been as disappointed as I was at the Greenhouse Tavern.  Yes, the focus on locally grown food makes me all warm and fuzzy on the inside but let's get serious, if you're going to spend $150 on dinner for two, it better taste good, too.  Not that our food was bad-tasting, it just wasn't anywhere near \"One of the Best New Restaurants of 2010\" according to Bon Appetite.  I'm thrilled that the Bon is paying homage to a local eatery but in order to sustain this joint after the hoopla has worn off, the wait staff has to step it up a notch, the dishes have to have an element of pizzazz past drowning in garlic and citrus juices and/or the prices have to reflect what basic ingredients (like $11 French Fries) should cost.  Sorry to be a buzz kill... my first review ever, just felt I needed to save another from being overly expectant of a superior experience."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch last sunday before the game. We sat at the bar. This place has good food. Not the chef's fault. Its the service that is horrible. The servers act like they could care less about the customer. They move slow and ignore you at every turn.  We waited 45 min for our meal. The food was  ICE cold, obviously having sat there in the kitchen for 30 min while our server ignored the order. Then they had the nerve to serve our cold food with no silverware. It was not that crowded. I have other complaints but this is enough. DO NOT go to this place. I will never go back. Its a shame they hire such terrible help, it has potential otherwise."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing.

Get a bottle of wine and the bread board and sit back and relax. You will not be disappointed.

Sorry for the extremely short review but there really just is not much more i could say. This one you NEED to experience for yourself."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner Saturday night! Have to try the bacon wrapped dates with chocolate, chicken wings, steamed clams! The Chef's taste course is well worth the money. For dessert the salted caramel creme is fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Not great,  not terrible.  My wife enjoyed her meal.  My steak was average at best.  A strip steak should cut through like butter.  It was tough and kind of rubbery.  Waiter blamed the kitchen for a miscommunication on our order.  Probably won't go back.  Too many other places to visit with better service and food."}
{"text":"I can't help but feel like I'm missing something here. My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night and spent $100 with tip on an unmemorable meal. It's possible that we didn't order well. 

We shared the animal style frites, i had the kale salad, we each and a burger and a beer. Everything we tasted was good (the kale salad with a tzatziki dressing was the highlight for me), but certainly not worth the cost or the hype."}
{"text":"Very good food but pricey

Low rating due to service - waiter struggled through every facet of the meal including getting us our check - had to ask the water server and he ended up getting it for us 

Food not good enough to deal with the service"}
{"text":"Loved this place. From ambiance to wait staff to the food. It was spectacular. Had our food in about 20 minutes which was great!  Cool place to hang out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After an extremely long cross-country drive, I needed something quick, uncomplicated yet healthy and delicious, and I found it in their grass fed burger. It comes with a side of rosemary fries with a dollop of aoli, but they were kind enough to substitute a salad for a couple of dollars more. Worth every penny. Friendly and knowledgeable staff with lovely ambiance. I'll definitely be stopping by here on my way back to the west coast."}
{"text":"Not sure I'm ready for the whole pig head thing, but was knocked out by the Pan Fried Pork Chop Saltimbocca.Not your run-of-the-mill pork chop. Made with sage, country ham, pomme purée, scrapple & red eye gravy.  Yowza!

I didn't really get the popcorn thing. Maybe it was the two massive Bourbon-neat I had.

Casual place, old bikes on the wall (they're for sale-isn't everything, really?).
All-in-all a great, casual dinner with work colleagues. I'll be back, Mr. Pighead."}
{"text":"The starters were outstanding.  Fois gras clams,  Ohio cheese plate and cheesy biscuit were delicious.  The entrees were a disappointment.  Our group felt there was too much salt applied to the lamb burger,  steak and carrot tots. The Poutine and gravy fries hit the spot."}
{"text":"I got the bucket of chicken and celebrated Vanessa' bday. Good food, great cocktails."}
{"text":"Greenhouse tavern for lunch was divine.  I was skeptical at first as I am not one of those home-grown, all-natural, green foods people but I left stuffed and blissfully sated.  We spilt an order of the Crispy Chicken Wings Confit and the Gravy Frites which was ample for a lunch for two.  The wings were an amazing with a just enough heat and smothered in chives and garlic.  The gravy frites were rich, decadent and delicious.  Perhaps a better choice for a chilly Cleveland day and to share as an app for more than two people.  Highly recommended all the same.  The \" You Had me at Hello\" should be renamed \"You Had me at the First Sip\"  I drank two of these ridiculously good beverages and could have kept going for 10 more.  Can't wait to try their other specialty drinks.

The décor is modern yet cozy and the service was great.  Out server, Kevin, was extremely helpful and attentive without being overbearing.  Our lunch was leisurely and we were left to enjoy our meals without ever having an empty glass.  The lunch menu is small but it still seemed difficult to make a selection.  They change their menu frequently and I hope I have the opportunity to try some of the dishes I missed and am looking forward to trying out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This place is all around excellent! Farm to plate really works well here. There was plenty to choose from for the meat eater in me, and the vegan/vegetarian in my girlfriend. Also, I'm not much of a cocktail drinker usually, but the fresh natural ingredients in their drinks were awesome!

For appetizers we got the brussel sprouts, and the gravy fries. Both were good choices and I'd get them again.

Lastly, the main event for me was the entree and the Pig's Head! It's the entire reason I came here, and I'm so glad I went for it. Think of the best pork ribs you've ever had, and the pig's head here beats them. Juicy, moist, so flavorful, about as close to melt in your mouth as you can get. The best pork entree I've ever had! So worth it, and if you're on the fence, go for it....you won't regret it.

On a side note: Some weird negative reviews. Everyone has their own experience I guess, but some people just don't belong in a restaurant like this. Just sayin."}
{"text":"What's the point of having decent food if your service is awful enough to scare people from coming back?  Totally cliche hipster bar with a staff that really doesn't want you there.  Came with a group, a few of us were a bit behind.  Needed two tables, so they sat the first group.  Second group was five minutes behind.  We walked upstairs, and sat at a second table next to our group.  Promptly, (the only prompt part of the meal), we were told we had to go check in with the host even though we were in the same group.  There were six open tables and literally no one else in the upstairs dining area.  We go back to the host with our group of four to check in, and she proceeds to act as if they have no room. She asked us to wait while they get something ready. Ten minutes go by and they seat four other parties that are 3-4 people in size.  We finally get seated, and it's at the EXACT SAME TABLE we had sat at when we first got there.  Literally nothing had changed.

On to the drinks.  Worst bloody Mary I've ever had.  Not spicy (asked for spicy), and completely watered down.  TOOK 25 MINUTES TO GET FOUR DRINKS AND THE PLACE WAS INLY HALF FULL.  Color was like a fruit juice.  Watery and bland bloody mary.  They do have an extensive rare whiskey list, though.  Props on that.

Food, though, was good.  If you're okay with everything else being shitty, food is good.  We went for brunch, I got the chicken and waffles and a friend got the eggs Benedict.  The chicken waffles were great... The butter used had nice flavor and syrup was on point. They add a nice line of spicy hot sauce over the fried chicken which truly made the entire dish.  The eggs Benedict were also on point. They serve the food as it comes out, so one person in our party got their food an entire TEN MINUTES before me.  Once again, this is poor service and timing and can be fixed with some changes. 

Atmosphere: Cool layout.  Wooden bar, nice accent pieces, old bikes hanging from the ceiling.  Downfall is snotty, hipster staff who act like they don't want you there.

If they changed the personnel, I would consider coming back just for food.  But, for now, I'll be avoiding it."}
{"text":"This is a fun, trendy place in downtown Cleveland. The menu is set up so you basically have a 5 course meal. That was a little confusing to some in my party. I had the pork chop, which I wasn't quite sure about, but I am a picky eater and didn't see anything else on the menu I would want. Nevertheless, the pork chop was a great choice! It was cooked just right- so tender and juicy. It came with mashed potatoes, which was delicious as well. It was a little pricy, more so than I anticipated. 
But, If I'm ever in Cleveland again, I will have to come back here."}
{"text":"Since my first visit here, over a year ago, I have returned twice.  This is not a place I can afford to go to every day, but I really can't wait to go back. It has become my favorite dining experience in Cleveland.  Why?
I really like the use of local, seasonal meat and produce.  I really like the changing menu, with a few items that change, while most vary.  I like the variety of menu items and styles.  I like the vegan and vegetarian options.  I like the generous pours from the bar.  I like the friendly, attentive service.  I like that this is a high end dining experience that you can go to dressed casual and act casual.  It is not ostentatious.  It is fun.
I suggest you get the four course deal for $44, saving one course for dessert.  The devils on horseback are great, but the seasonal salads do no disappoint, either.  If you are adventurous, try the fifth quarter, which is their daily appetizer special.  Usually creative and amazing.  They have the unusual pig's head (yes, half of an intact pig's head) and Fred Flintsone short rib.  Both of these are pricey, but meant to be shared.  Their oxtail risotto is amazing - tastes better than it looks or sound.  Their daily specials are great.  I am not a person who likes their fish cooked with the skin on, but they have converted me.  If you are not adventurous, you can order a burger and fries.  Be prepared for a generous portion of meat on a flavorful bun done to your specification.  If you have a large group, order the bread board.  It is worth it for the variety of breads and spreads you will receive.
Then there is dessert.  The buttered popcorn pot de creme is as addicting as any illegal drug.  You can't stop eating it.  Other items are just as great.  Their pressed coffee and fresh tea help to complete your dining experience.
So if you are looking for a steakhouse, don't come here.  If you are looking just for a burger and fries, you probably will be left wondering what the hype is all about.  If you are looking for mainstream comfort food, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for a unique dining experience, with great service and well prepared food in a casual environment, this is your place.
I cannot rave enough about this place.  I am looking forward to returning, perhaps to try the rooftop dining during the summer."}
{"text":"Greenhouse has gotten progressively worse in the last 12 months, and last night they really missed the mark. We sat down at 6 for an 8:30 Cavs game. They must have lost our order b/c by 8:00 we still did not have our entrees. They claimed they were \"busy,\" although we were one of the first tables to sit down and definitely the last to be served. Took ~20 minutes to get a drink. Our waiter was lost most of the night. I had to leave before the meal even arrived to take a client to the game, while my colleagues hung around waiting even longer for the food. Apparently the manager apologized/took care of the entrees.  When you are paying $15 per drink, $15-20 per appetizer, and $40 for an entree, the service and quality of the experience should be meaningfully better. Either cut your prices or step your game up to a level more commensurate with the price tag. 

Also, the menu really has not changed much in the last few years, and nothing that compelling has awed me recently. It's a shame b/c I like the concept and casual environment. Hope to see some improvement in the next few months vs. things deteriorating further."}
{"text":"Do try the wings and the gravy fries. Duck skin pasta not worth the try. Overall, I thought this place was a bit overrated. The first time I came here, it was St Patty's Day and I had quite a few drinks in me. I ordered their special corned beef and was WOW-ed away by it. I swore I had to come back to relive the savory taste.

I came back to Greenhouse Tavern last week, excited (despite the price!). BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I ordered an appetizers that was duck skin pasta. First, first a very small plate that i finished in 3 bites, it was $12. no joke. PROs- it had a lot of flavors. CONs- too salty, too little duck skin, TOO LITTLE FOOD. 

All my friends ordered their wings because it was the most \"worth your money\" food on the menu. PROs- veryyyy tender, very flavorful. CONs- too salty, again. The wings is a must try though... the meat falls right over the chicken bones and it is soo tender! However, with that said, it was too salty for me to be able to eat 8 whole wings.

Then, I also tried my friends gravy fries and the gravy was delicious but verrrrrryyy spicy. PROs- lots of fries, right amount of gravy, tasteful gravy. CONs- too salty.

Overall, food is a hit or miss. And you better be prepared to drink ALOT of water to overcome the saltiness of their food!"}
{"text":"I used to think this place was a little too pretentious for a city like Cleveland. It kind of is, but I don't even care anymore. The food is *so good* that I can overlook being served drinks in a mason jar or looking at vintage bikes while I'm sitting at the bar.

There are two items in particular that blew me away, and I guess it's no surprise that they're the two \"trashiest\" items at this relatively upscale place: the chicken wings, and the animal frites. 

I don't know what I can say about the chicken wings that hasn't been said 1000 times, but they are every bit as good as the hype suggests. Perfect flavour and crispy texture, plus fall-off-the-bone tenderness. Just unbelievable. 

The animal frites are the perfect late night snack to share after you've had a few rounds of drinks. Living up in Canada now, I've developed quite a taste for poutine. The animal frites satisfy that urge and then some by adding fried eggs, bacon, and amazing deli mustard. 

I guess I should mention I'm only really reviewing the happy hour menu here, but that's one of the best parts about this place: happy hour is twice a day and for 3+ hours at a time. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Hands down my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  My fiancé even proposed to me here.  Their menu often changes, but some of my favorites are the lamb burger, caesar salad (seems weird to favorite, but now I'm comparing every caesar salad to this one), gravy frites, and buttered popcorn pot de creme.  They have great food, great drinks, and a great atmosphere.  The servers are always attentive and helpful.  You can get a good meal on just appetizers or splurge and get the tasting menu.

If you go on a busy night, make sure to have a reservation.  They also have a cool rooftop bar.  However, the rooftop is only for drinks.  I've been here on busy Saturday nights, Sundays after a Browns game, and random lunches.  It always hits the spot!

If you are in Cleveland, Greenhouse Tavern is a must."}
{"text":"Absolutely not to be missed. Chef Sawyer makes even the classics extraordinary. For a specific recommendation, just close your eyes and point at the menu."}
{"text":"My husband is having dinner here without me.  

He's meeting friends of ours who are in town last minute and celebrating their anniversary.  I have a prior commitment, but will be thinking of their dining experience and drooling (discretely, if possible).  

Location, service, food, libations = fun night out!  

I appreciate GT's local, green principles, and just the overall sense of goodwill in this place.  It has a downtown vibe without being too pretentious.  John was our server the last time we came and he was amazing.  He catered to my dietary needs and made excellent recommendations.  

We like to order small plates and share.  Some of my favorites are the Local Turnips & Radishes, Sweet Wintered Carrots, Raw & Roasted Rittman Farm Apple and Celery Leaf Salad, Crispy Hominy, Devils on Horseback, and the Pommes Frites w/raw garlic, rosemary & aioli.  Oh, that garlic!  GT offers dishes to the season, which makes for an exciting menu.

It's easy to spend a lot of money here, so plan accordingly.  

I promise you, it will be worth it."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Im rounding up to 5 stars because in theory, the drinks/food is a little over priced, but maybe that's just my opinion as a frugal person.  

Went here for my buddy's Bachelor Party.  The drinks (while pricey) were amazing, and everyone was able to find something that catered to their unique libation palate. 

We got some nice appetizers which are great and have already been covered... Plus the Pig's Head - which is unique to this place in... All of America?  Regardless, it was presented well, and although a bit greasy, It was pretty delicious.  They give you bread and fixins to make sammiches out of it, but I think only one person actually did that.  Also I think it was presented differently in 2015 than the 1st time i went to this restaurant.  (Before it 'looked like a pig head', this time it was just the meat prepared in a way that was more appetizing for the masses.)  

I've also bought the fancy beer-vinegar that Jon Sawyer I think makes as a hobby.  Its tasty, and goes great in salad dressings.  Makes a great gift for foodies.  

Overall, I really like this place and dig their vibe... Only downside is the price and occasional waits."}
{"text":"This place just gets it. Chef Sawyer knows exactly which flavors go well with other flavors. All you have to do is sit back, order and enjoy.

A good example of those flavors are present in the Crispy Chicken Wings Confit that pack an explosion of scallions, jalapeños, garlic and lemon. A very unique chicken wing. The Lamb Burger might be the best burger in Cleveland, especially when you're craving something a little bit different than your normal beef burger. Also, an overlooked menu item are the homemade chips. These chips have a hint of a salt and vinegar taste to them,which is a really underrated taste for a chip.

All in all, this is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland, good for anything from a nice sit down date or to grab a bite to eat at the bar."}
{"text":"I was in town recently for a conference and had drinks on the rooftop as well as dinner at the bar on the first floor. My Ohio Beef Burger was cooked to the correct temperature and seasoned well. The fries came out looking a little more well done than I prefer but tasted great. Cooked with whole cloves of garlic and sprigs of rosemary they hit the spot. 

I paid more for a burger and fries than I'm used to, but my mouth still waters thinking about it. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day while visiting my sister. I had heard lot of good things about Greenhouse Tavern. Left a bit disappointed.

I get the organic, locally produced concept, but the food was not creative enough or executed well enough to warrant the prices.  I've had better in NYC for less, which is surprising because I associate NYC with exorbitant price gorging.

Fois Gras Steamed Clams: 6 clams in a buttery sauce. I was not amazed. 3/5
Ratatouille ($12): Executed well, but nothing special 
Beef Burger ($15): For all of the hype about this burger, it wasn't impressive. It wasn't poorly executed but I didn't 3/5
Lamb Burger ($18): This was the most disappointing. The bun came out soggy and flavors seemed unbalanced. 2/5
Pork Chop Saltimbocca ($24): A pork chop on top of mash potatoes. Nothing to write home about. 3/5

The service was ok. Our waiter was nice enough to chat at the end of the meal about where they get their Fever Tree ginger ale, but the staff was not entirely attentive through out the meal.

At least they had Jeni's ice cream for dessert. The food wasn't bad, I've just have had better. Pricey, you can get better bang for your buck in Cleveland. 2/5"}
{"text":"The chicken wings are as amazing as everyone else has been saying.  I could easily eat a plate as a meal.  The portion is generous and is a hearty app that could be shared between two or three people.  The gravy fries were delicious also and best shared between a few people since its also a very heavy dish.  Our waitress Alice did a good job managing multiple tables in a busy time."}
{"text":"Thank you Greenhouse, I will never be able to eat chicken wings from any other place ever again. Seriously, how can chicken wings be so simple yet so delectable? Tangy, garlicky fall-off-the-bone perfection. My boyfriend and I ordered the \"Flintstones\" beef short rib as a main course. I remember reading on yelp that the portion is huge but we still both yelled when the server approached us with a GIANT platter that took up our entire table. The beef was so tender - no knife needed. Worth the splurge. My only criticism is I wish there were more vegetables and salad greens to balance out the richness of the beef. Needless to say we both barely made a dent in the dish and took most of it home and enjoyed it for not one but two more full meals. We also ordered the gravy frittes which were okay, a bit oversalted. The gravy was delicious. 

Overall one of the best restaurants I've been to in the Cleve. Awesome vibe and decor (VHS tapes line the walls, old bikes hanging from the ceilings). I'll be coming back for the wings (duh) and the pig head."}
{"text":"A great foodie experience. Kevin (K2) was an outstanding waiter."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service.  We had the half a pig head which was great however,  my son had the pasta which was very good but the portion size was very small.  Kinda expensive but I'd go back again."}
{"text":"The food was horrid.  Service was par if that's.


Had chicken salad.  I could not believe the the amount of salt they put o. The child. Was so over powering.  

My friend had a burger and said it had a really bad smell.  I agreed.  I thought maybe it was he cheese... Either way it was repulsive and I would dare to take a bite."}
{"text":"Very creative menu that just doesn't deliver that well.  Cool place but not buying the hype."}
{"text":"I would post a picture of the food but it's too late! Visiting Cleveland for the night and decided to come here because they have a nice patio and allow pups!! It turned out that their food was delicious too! My fiancé ordered the classic old fashion and I got the French 65. Both were delicious and boozy! For food we got a bunch of snacks to share. Our favorites include the confit wings (they are amazing and way better than any other wings you have had!) and the Brussels sprouts were delicious! Would definitely come back!  The only negative I would have is that it is located in a fairly congested and touristy street. But well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly, knowledgable staff and owners. The entire menu is carefully thought out and well executed (try the hog's head and fried brussel sprouts!), and they have a rooftop bar! They hold a yoga session on the roof on the weekends, in addition to many other events and cooking demonstrations that customers can purchase tickets to. This is the type of restaurant that Cleveland deserves. Well done!"}
{"text":"The food is epic. The atmosphere is fun. Order the pig head, the cheese poofs, and the poutine. Bring an appetite because you will want everything. From a foodie to anyone who appreciates great modern, non pretentious food... this kitchen is on point."}
{"text":"I've since been back to Greenhouse Tavern and my opinion has changed. 
The good first:
Their rooftop bar is wonderful in good weather. Great experience.
The soups, service and bread is much better. 
I actually love their soup and have had a few dishes that I would return for. I have a feeling the dish I once had is now removed, but I may be incorrect. The grilled cheese is fantastic. Apparently Cleveland does grilled cheese well (Melt, Touch.)
Their drink specials are usually reliable so check those out too.

The down-side: 
Their butter for the table bread has pork in it!
I'm vegetarian (as is my husband) and we don't even want them to waste that on our plates. Let the customer know about this so they can reject this spread before it hits the table and gets wasted. Nothing is worse than being a vegetarian and feeling you've wasted an animal product.

Also the fries are not vegetarian. Another down side."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Try the burger or the bread + butter.  Great decor.  Warm service."}
{"text":"Drinks mediocre. Never the same twice. Love the rooftop though... But the bathroom up there was closed which meant a serious hike to the basement for to P."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences!  My wife and I recently took a trip to Cleveland to enjoy a meal from a couple of my favorite chefs. When we entered the tavern we were greeted very nicely and sat rather quickly. Our waiter, Josh was awesome. Took time to explain all the menu had to offer even though I had investigated the menu and was pretty sure what I was ordering. I will admit he almost had me talked into one of the other fine dishes but I decided to stick with my thought of the Pan Fried Pork Chop Saltimbocca, and glad I did!  Josh talked me into giving the Brussels sprouts a try as a starter and for that I can't thank him enough. I have never had a tastier Brussel Sprout, to say they were good is and understatement!  Then the main course arrived and every bite was so good. The pork chop done to perfection, I hated to see the bottom of the plate.  And just as I finished up, Josh gifted us with some of the Crispy Chicken Wings Confit, wow!!! They were equally delicious!  He even brought us samples of the house made soda's and those were all better than the big name counterparts. My only regret is I had no room for a dessert but the next time I go, I will order that first so I am sure to enjoy it!  Thank you Greenhouse Tavern staff and especially Josh for making one of our best anniversary dining experiences possible. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I decided we would have lunch here when I saw the outdoor seating area almost full.  The service was really off all around, similar to what some other reviewers also experienced.  It made for an annoying lunch, especially when it's supposed to be a nicer place. 

The chicken wings' lemon, jalapeño, scallion topping was good. The chicken itself is a crispy and dry texture all the way through. 

The chips appetizer was a long wooden board of potato chips and homemade Fritos with a good dip. The Fritos are curled like a ball and very hard/crunchy.  

The veggie burger was bland, no distinguishable flavor and had a decent simple side salad. 

The kids spaghetti was good with a nice tomato cream sauce, but the side of sautéed vegetables it came with was definitely not kid friendly. They were all long pieces and some were not easy to cut into like the celery. The carrots and red peppers were the only vegetables that seemed ok for a kid.  

The fries were mostly full rosemary sprigs and dried garlic (neither of which you'd eat) with a very small number of fries, and I think they were $7."}
{"text":"I chuckled at another reviewer's \"mother of God\" comment but now I get it, he was so right! This was just an exceptional dining experience.  We had the charred ramps, kale salad, sardi pasta and vadoun of baby golden beets.  Each dish was unusual, incredibly flavorful and beautifully prepared.  Our server Kevin gave us some great recommendations, even suggesting the cheapest glass of wine and items that would be good for sharing. We asked him to pick a dessert for us, and the creme egg was another big hit.  The place has a casual, funky vibe and seemed to be full of nice people; we even enjoyed chatting with the diners next to us as we all swooned over our food.  Honestly, I'd look forward to another business trip to Cleveland just so I could go back to this restaurant. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been all over the world traveling to many places eating my way through cities, and I must say I would not have thought that my best meal would be in Cleveland. I love New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles food scene, but this meal was at Greenhouse Tavern was amazing.

It could have been because of the beautiful day we had outside as we were sitting outside. Maybe it was the crowds of people walking through The Flats. Tons of couples getting married. The service, by our server Ally, was impeccable. She handled everything appropriately, checked on us often, and always had a smile on her face. She was great! Definitely one of the reasons why this place deserves 5 stars and made this one of our best meals. 

Anyways, we ordered a feast for 3 of us. We ordered two menu tastings and that was way more than enough to fill all 3 of us. Everything we ordered was amazing!  We started off with Corn Bones and the Fifth Quarter. Both were simply amazing. I didn't think the corn bones would be good, but boy was I wrong! Definitely give that a shot.

Seconds...Foie Gras Steamed Clams and Crispy Chicken Wings (we also got the fried chicken thrown in too). Steamed clams were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the best thing about that dish. The crispy chicken wings were not too spicy, yet had the great kick of lime to make it all good. Loved it. Fried Chicken was cooked to perfection! The meat was so tender and moist, and the skin was very crisp with not much batter at all.

Thirds....of course we got the Pig's Head and the Fred Flintstone Beef Short Ribs. Good thing we had a table that was meant for 6 people because these two plates took up the whole table! As we were by the entrance, everybody walked in staring at our plates. Surprised at the size of this thing! Anyways, the pigs head was amazing. I've always wanted to try it, and it did not disappoint. Yes, there is more fat than meat, but it's a pig's head! How often are you going to be able to eat that? The Fred Flintstone Beef Short Ribs were huge! The meat was cooked well and the flavors were perfect. 

As for the desserts....we had everything on that dessert menu. The ones that I would recommend getting is the Pot de Creme (I think that's what it's called). It's the buttered popcorn. I had no idea what to expect until I ate it. Perfectly balanced and complex that it just works. You definitely have to get the scoop all the way to the bottom of that cup. 

Give this place a shot, and you will not be disappointed! Make sure to make reservations as this place does and will get packed!"}
{"text":"One of the top 5 meals of my life. My husband and I did the chef's tasting menu, which at $58 for 5 courses is an absolute bargain. He started with at least 3 old fashioneds (it was our semi-annual date night, after all) and proclaimed them amazing. We loved the amuse, pomegranate seeds, blood oranges, honey, something else, but 50 different harmonious flavors in one bite.. THIS is how food should be.

He loved his jerky plate, and my spring pea salad was divine, and I was skeptical TBH. The brussel sprouts beat Lolita by a mile - really - and were the best I've ever had. The chicken wings are recommended for a reason; don't go without an order. My husband had the steak and frites and though the steak was more well done than medium, he said the flavor was so awesome it didn't even matter.

I ordered the tabasco fried chicken. I expected a delicate little chicken leg atop some artisinal blah blah blah. The giant bucket with SIX giant pieces of fried chicken absolutely shocked this country girl who grew up on the working class staple of a bucket of gas station fried chicken for dinner. The white bread to soak up the juices at the end was the highlight. they had globs of BUTTER atop the chicken... BUTTER ON FRIED CHICKEN. I quickly scooped it up and slathered it on the bread. I managed one drumstick, and my husband ate the rest for breakfast the next morning. The fermented relish was interesting, but my parents can relish from their own garden, so I'm partial to that.

Dessert? Oh, buttered popcorn pot de creme and ricotta fritters. Both were absolutely the best desserts I've had in Cleveland. The petit fours to complete the tasting menu were good, if not necessary. 

Every bite exploded with flavor. I wanted to go to the kitchen and kiss each of the chefs. 

Make a reservation a week ahead of time for a weekend, at least."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun - it screams natural and artistic like something out of Portland. Their menu is even made of leather. The rooftop, when open, is my favorite place to get a drink in the summertime.  You're surrounded by the sights and sounds of 4th Street and drinking some of the best libations money can buy.

I would give their service 5 stars.  The staff is warm and friendly, and they are so knowledgeable. USE THEM - tell them what kind of taste and substance you are in the mood for, and they can pick something off their menu and it will surely not disappoint. 

The food is amazing. They start you off with bread with some of the best-tasting EVOO I've ever had.   I love Love LOVE the mushroom risotto. Their pommes frites never disappoint either.  Their desserts are the best in town, but they are so small they always leave me wanting more.  

My only beef with Greenhouse (pun intended) is the value.  You have to get multiple courses if you want to leave full, and the prices are not modest.  Tack on some drinks and wine and you're talking $80 or so per person. Yet, I find myself going back again and again."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night. It was packed but our server was great. Our food, however, was very salty and the only things I loved were the wings. I'd make a special trip just for that. But my pork was salty and my boyfriend had salty lamb burger."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Cleveland and it's not even close. Get the Animal Frites and the Beef Tartare and the Confit Chicken Wings. Oh and the Foie Gras Clams. I would bathe in the broth if it were socially acceptable."}
{"text":"If you like a house salad with so many mustard seeds that will be all you taste during the meal and days after or if you like room temperature beer and really really slow service despite the restaurant being more than adequately staffed, this is your place.  Shame really, as I hadn't been back to this place in a few years and maybe it was an off day, but it has fallen off the mark.  Serious in need of someone running the front of the house (and expediting and dialing down the mustard seed).  East 4th was packed tonight and Greenhouse was barely half full....that's not a great sign as it's not like every option on east 4th is outstanding.  Hope they pull it together.  Still waiting after 45 min for my second course....and it's not even that busy and there are tons of waiters / waitresses and servers milking around.  We are foodies both my wife and I and have had meals across the cleveland area and the world and I have to say, this one is pretty bad (given their reputation).  Steer clear..."}
{"text":"My experience with Greenhouse Tavern was amazing, and not to mention that they were filming during our dining experience, so I felt like I was a superstar. No joke, they had a full camera crew near the bar while I was eating. Also really cool to see the owner getting interviewed by classy people.

Besides that, I totally loved the atmosphere, the staff, and the food. The waiters were absolutely adorable, and I completely disregarded anything that they said because they were that cute. But, I did somehow end up ordering their pizza and salad which my friend and I split. For $10 each I though it was a great deal. VERY unique. Definitely NOT your standard food options, with that being said, I really enjoyed the different flavors and varieties Incorporated in the pizza. 

I can't wait to go back!

However, ONE little downfall, which I don't know if done on purpose (doubtful) but my friend and I both had little to no cell phone service. I saw that this is a big place for lunch time and people who need to make calls would have to step outside, kind of a bummer but I still didn't mind too much.

There is an upstairs, which next time I think I'd like to sit up there and try that out. But again, loved the location and the food options. Knowing that this is Ohio's first and only certified green restaurant is amazing, if you are going to Greenhouse you need to check out the owners video on the Downtown Cleveland Alliance website. Talks about his experience with the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best wings I ever had. Different but in a good way. They way that will draw you in like other yelp reviews did me and not leave you disappointed."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews from past customers and usually had a hard time finding a reservation time.  I just expected this place to be amazing... what I found was small portions and a large bill.  Have to say some of the selections for dinner were very good. The brussel sprouts were great but $11 for about six sprouts?  The property including the bathrooms are showing major wear and tear."}
{"text":"Giving it five stars because it's one of the few restaurants that I actually crave certain dishes from! Have been here numerous times and never had a bad experience or a bad meal.

I actually first tried the place because Michael Symon talked about their frites on the food network, so naturally I had to try them. I've had every version now - the more \"naked\" rosemary fries are amazing for potato purists - perfectly seasoned; the gravy fries are my personal favorite because the gravy is just deliciously flavored and a little extra salty, which I love; the animal frites are my hubby's favorite: gravy, mustard, cheese curds, a fried egg all smothering your fries - a complex blend of flavors, so indulgent.

I crave the kale salad - simple, fresh, and crispy. The Caesar salad is also amazing (I like extra garlic and I guess the chef does too!). The wings are to die for, as is the fried chicken (best I've ever had). The lamb burger is melt in your mouth delicious. Basically, it is really hard to not want to order the entire menu!! If they are offering a five course taster that night, definitely go for it.

They have a happy hour as well as a reverse happy hour (late night dining) that's a great way to avoid the big dinner crowd (smaller menu but still always delicious). Service is always on point, the wait staff want you to have a great dining experience and really know the menu well enough to recommend things based on your taste. I once got to sit at the kitchen \"bar\" (you literally sit right at the prep station) which was so much fun and helped us scope out meal ideas for next time! One of my favorite spots in Cleveland - highly recommend it and definitely ask your waiter to help you order if it's your first time."}
{"text":"Literally just had lunch there, walked to my hotel room to write this. Service was ok, my server was very nice but sadly only checked on me once at the beginning of my meal while I was eating the squash salad and not very often after that. I looked around because my water glass was empty, but no one around to call. So I waited about 7 minutes before someone looked my way to get a refill on my water. Now on to the food which was waaaayyy underwhelming (squash salad) and not good at all (steak tartare). For the squash salad it is $10 for a salad piled only one half the plate. It consisted of dressed spinach, thinly sliced apple, thinly sliced squash, and little dollops of sour cream or creme fresh. Yes the most interesting thing was the taste of the squash because it wasn't raw and prepared nicely, but the rest was boring. When my waitress came to check on me while I was eating my salad if something is underwhelming, I won't send it back it's just meh or say much. I ordered it, so I'll live with that. The steak tartare however...there were so many wrong things on this dish. The rosemary fries that came with it way too salty (I had 3 pieces before I gave up). The steak tartare came deconstructed. What I should have done was taste all the elements before mixing. But I didn't and was left trying to pick pieces out of the tartare to just eat and get the heck out. The fermented relish they had, didn't taste in any way fermented and felt like the consistency of very thin plastic. It was the very thick skin of some sort of pepper and the pieces stuck to the back of my throat as I'm trying to eat. The consistency of the steak tartare was so mushy because it was overgrounded. When you have a good soft piece of meat like that, your better off hand chopping it than hand grinding it. I've tasted raw ground beef before (I know unsafe), but it was mushier than that! And lastly the 3 minute egg on top. When I first tried to dump the 3 minute egg onto the tartare to mix in all that came out was clear liquid....an undercooked egg. When you make tartare and have a raw egg mixed in, it is usually only the yolk that is added to add a velvety consistency and not make it watery and snot looking with the raw egg white. I picked up my tartare and did my best to try and flip the liquid out and just continue eating. It was bad enough that I had to pour out the rest of the raw egg white still in the eggshell on my salad plate. 

And don't worry that I am in any way just a one shot gal. I will be back for dinner service because there are still things I want to try and see if the other dishes have any redeeming qualities. I think for what I tasted today, I'm being very gracous giving it a second try."}
{"text":"This is based on two visits. Our first visit was right before the Tribe's wild card playoff game. We had tickets, so we were just looking for a quick bite before first pitch. The menu was VERY overwhelming. There are \"Firsts, Seconds, Thirds, Chef's tasting,\" etc. Our waiter acted like it was crazy not to order multiple courses and we felt like we were in the wrong to only order entrees and get to the game. The food was good (lamb burgers were a little dry), but we didn't love the experience.  I'd give the first visit 3 1/2 stars. Once we ate there, we decided it was perfectly fine to order as we did and we may do so in the future; it was just our waiter that was uptight about it. We were interested in coming back for the full menu experience and thus comes the second part of my review.

We came for my wife's birthday and had plenty of time committed to the chef's tasting experience. Our waiter was so much friendlier than the last guy. He helped us decipher the menu and we both decided on the chef's tasting. You have to order all your courses up front (hard to pick with so many great selections). For some reason, I thought portions would be smaller in the chef's tasting, but I was way off. I had devils on horseback (uhhhhmazing), chicken fried chicken (like a meal in itself), and we shared the short rib. Okay, this short rib is MONSTROUS. Our waiter advised us we could share this and have it count as both of our entrees. Good thing we did because there was NO ROOM for anything else on our table. Oh yeah, and it was delicious. The vegetables around the meat had so much flavor and the meat was super tender. My wife had carrot frites as her first, and the star of the night was her gnocchi as a second. HOLY COW. It melted in my mouth...  errr, I mean her mouth. I definitely didn't steal half her food. :-) For dessert, we had fried chocolate milk. It was good; not my favorite, but good. I'd go with the popcorn next time (had that on our first visit). 

We absolutely LOVED our second visit. Actually, we loved it enough to forgive the first forgettable trip and give GHT 5 stars overall. We took SO much food home. We're already planning a return trip. Next time, we'll share one chef's tasting (devils and gnocchi for sure) and order an extra entree to try different menu items."}
{"text":"Without question, one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. they are so accommodating and creative. Love the food."}
{"text":"you MUST try this this place out.

My new FAV spot in cle- HANDS DOWN!!
Amazing patio, great for ppl watching on East 4th and they have a kickass ROOF TOP BAR! SOOOOOOO cool and SOOOOOO not cle lol

Now for the food- The wings are a MUST! the meat seriously falls off the bone and they have this awesome spiciness to them.
The lamb burger was cooked to perfection, the clams were great (half doz) and the gnocchi was perfect! 
Every dish they brought out i wanted to try so i will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food in this place was amazing! For apps we had the poutine style fries and the cheese balls.  Then for dinner I had the baked potatoes. The portions are huge! My boyfriend had the lamb burger which he said was interesting but very good. 

They have a great craft beat selection and the device was fabulous:m. There are lots of vegan and GFO options on the menu. 

The atmosphere and the vibe of the place is super cool. I would suggest making reservations."}
{"text":"Had the fried smelt and they were great with my beer.  Good service, and they were playing Beetlejuice behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Had a REALLY HORRIBLE Brunch experience, which was a surprise because we go to Greenhouse often and have always been pleased.

Here is list of what went wrong with Brunch:
- With the standard egg breakfast -- you only get 1 piece of meat, and very small piece of burnt bread.
- Sausage was not cooked at all (completely raw) -- had to send it back
- Breakfast came back with eggs completely fried through when the order was for over easy eggs, and the sausage appeared to still not be cooked.
- When we mentioned our displeasure, we were asked \"what can we do for you\" when I think it would have been more appropriate to just remove this dish from the bill as oppose to asking the customer for the correct course of action."}
{"text":"I think they spend more effort on thinking unusual menu items than they do creating good food. Prices were high. Salt seemed to be overused on every item. I've seen other reviews comment on these points, and I certainly agree.  

The service was good, but for me, the food is the first criteria for dining, and Greenhouse Tavern didn't deliver."}
{"text":"This review is in regards to their happy hour only. We decided to check out some happy hours downtown the other day and we chose this one based on the happy hour food menu. I was looking for low carb options and saw that wings and salad were happy hour specials. After we got there and I had time to study the HH menu a bit more, I decided to go with the beef tartare and frites (no, the frites were not low carb ha!). Even though it was a special, I still paid $12 for a lump of raw meat, 3 tiny baguettes, and a cone full of fries. My bf on the other hand, got the wings ($9) and gravy fries ($7) that could feed a family of 4. I will say that everything we got was pretty tasty. I wasn't a fan of the wings (too salty) but I would definitely get the tartare again. I can't speak to the drink selection, but according to the bf \"the happy hour beer selection was f*cking terrible\". I'm posting an pic of the menu so you can make your own judgments before you go, but word to the wise, be prepared for a higher-end happy hour and I hope you like wine and liquor!"}
{"text":"Honestly, in my opinion, the best restaurant in the whole city of Cleveland! I never can get enough of this place. The atmosphere is  unique and fun. Truly 5-star quality! 

My recommendation: Greenhouse chicken wings, Pigs Head with Frites, and Popcorn Brûlée"}
{"text":"Had a great time here!
Food was delicious, creative, and well presented!
Our server was top notch and the Kitchen Coffee was great fun!
Decor and layout is very unique and well done.
I hope to get back soon."}
{"text":"Cool spot on East 4th street serving up lots of Vegetarian, gluten-free and vegan options. Cleveland has tons of Steak Houses and not much else, so to come across a spot like this was refreshing and much needed. For starters and sides we ordered Gravy Fries (which we didn't eat, and wouldn't order again), Brussel Sprouts (excellent), broccoli (also excellent). We were curious about the entrees, so we ended up ordering 3 entrees between two of us: Seared Red Snapper, Tabasco Fried Chicken, and the Vegan BBQ. The Red Snapper was amazing, especially the fresh (spicey) chutney that it was served with. The Tobasco chicken was hot (as expected) and the chicken tender and juicy. The Vegan BBQ was a combination of several small samples combined on one plate including: onion rings, carrots, spices green beans, bbq mushrooms, bread and a small salad. It was very delicious and combined all sorts of different flavours into one interesting dish. We would definitely come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth visiting. The food was perfectly cooked. The flavors were simple and well done. The ambience was casual, comfortable, and hip. The chef wandered through and said \"hey\" while we were dining, which was cool.

The beers are craft beers and rotate regularly (both bottled and draught). If you order a dish with French fries, be prepared for quantity. Unfortunately, they were out of two menu items that I was really excited about.

Seven people paid about $135 for food, including tip (no dessert, and booze was $15 more). We all ended up stuffed.

The dishes that I tried:
jalapeno wings: normal (though perfectly fried) wings. the roasted jalapeno confit was an awesome salsa, but not special enough to make this more than gourmet wings.

animal frites: bacon, eggs, and goat cheese with fries. it tasted like a really great breakfast hash.

mushroom gnocchi: soft and chewy. creamy and rich and had a strong and delicious mushroom flavor. I'm not an experienced gnocchi nosher, so I'm not sure what it's \"supposed\" to taste like, or what the texture is \"supposed\" to be, but if it's like this, then I'll keep having gnocchi whenever I can.

ohio burger: a perfectly cooked burger (or at least so close that I couldn't tell the difference). if that's your thing, then this will make you happy.

I'd say that the strength of the Greenhouse Tavern was less the interesting dishes or inspired flavor, and more the amazingly skillful application of heat. You may have noticed that *everything* was perfectly cooked. Crispy but not greasy or dry wings. Juicy but not raw hamburger. Runny but not slimy eggs. Tender bacon. Pasta with just a bit of chew. I was impressed."}
{"text":"I am giving one star out of five due to poor service. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Greenhouse Tavern for lunch today - he has dined at the restaurant once before and I have not. He recommended that we should go there for lunch because he recalled the food being tasty. As soon as we walked in, we did not get a warm welcome from the hostess. Aside from that, our bartender/server, Jessica, was extremely aloof. From being glued to her phone infront of us, eating chips, forgetting to order our food, being unsociable and unapproachable, Jessica made our visit extra awkward and uncomfortable. Being a server myself, I questioned her tactics and wonder why she is even in the service industry at all. My boyfriend and I will not be coming back to this restaurant because of the negative experience we had today."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat and drink. I had the old fashioned on tap, fried Brussel sprouts, and pulled mushroom bbq sandwich. All were delicious and I would come back for them"}
{"text":"I had their ribeye and was very disappointed. Quality of the steak was underwelming at best.  Flavor was so so and meat was tough.  I doubt that it was even choice and for $40?  Wasn't asked by wait staff how meal was or I would have told them.  They must take it for granted...Not!!  Guest had burger and it was so so as well.  Will definitely find another place to eat next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food quality and presentation.  When I visited this place, it was during a heavy snow, so the place was empty, but the food, the presentation, and service were all on-point.  I enjoyed the brussel sprouts - well balanced, with a garlic type sauce, and enough crunch.  The roasted eggplant was well done -- any maybe a bit too well-done, were it was basically a sauce, within the skin.  Nonetheless, extremely tasty."}
{"text":"I am giving The Greenhouse Tavern five stars for various reasons.  First off, I have been here multiple times and have had the same experience with the food and service and consistency is important to me.  My first suggestion is to make a reservation.  I always have for dinner and have always been seated on time.  Both times I have also witnessed tables sit empty both times, which makes me believe that they do not overbook and try to account for all of the variables of running a restaurant (and also heard them turn people away when they could have snuck in that table and hoped for the best.) I have had different servers and have revived attentive, but not overbearing.  The food has been awesome!  I highly recommend the wings as an appetizer.  They are fall off the bone and the flavors make me want more.  The pork ramen is very good and has a great depth of flavor.  The Fred Flintstone short rib was excellent and was enough food for 2.5 people.  I have honestly never had a bad meal here. They also have a  children's menu; it is always nice when nicer restaurants make a smaller plate for children.  The buttered pot de Creme is delicious and the perfect way to end the meal (make sure you go all the way to the bottom to get all the goodness in one bite.). If you must have chocolate, the soufflé is your way to go.  They have a great beer and wine selection for everyone at all price points.  I have always had a great experience and this is our go-to restaurant whenever we have people in from out of town!"}
{"text":"So I've been hyping this place up for months since the last time I was here with my friend. I got the wings confit with him and they just fell apart in my hand. They were amazing. 

But I came this time with my girlfriend and got the same order with an addition of Brussel Sprouts, Beef Jerky and Animal Frites. The wings were so disappointing. They were too bitter and were not as tender and no flavor. Honestly it was a huge step down. The animal frites were soggy and aside from the type of bacon it didn't seem any different from any other pub fare. However the jerky is something I think people need to try as well as the Brussel sprouts.

The service was great and I don't want to make any assumptions of quality of the typical lunch and dinner menus, but from these items I was not too excited to return for Brunch again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to TGT a few times over the years for drinks and small plates, but was recommended their brunch recently and decided to give it a try. I was told their bloody Mary's were amazing and that the no name frites were definitely worth trying. 
We made a reservation, so when walking in and giving our name we were seat immediately, by a very friendly hostess. As soon as we took seats at our table water was poured and our server followed. She was super friendly, and answered all the questions we had. Luckily they were having waffle specials for national waffle day, and I was super pumped for the (wait for it) VEGAN WAFFLE OPTION!  Side note, it's probably been over 8 years since my last waffle due to my dairy intolerance and pure laziness to make a vegan one myself, so I knew instantly what I would be ordering. 
Also on their brunch menu they offer smaller portions of some regular dishes for kids, which was perfect since my daughter was part of brunch :) 
We ordered for her a single pancake, plain, and they were happy to oblige, also ordered her a side bacon.My husband ordered the no name frites, after debating between that and the chicken and waffles. The frites were recommended and seem to be a favorite in house. I ordered the vegan waffle, obvi, and I had to order the Bloody Mary. 

Drink was very quick to come and the food was also very quick. Wow! The vegan waffle was possibly one of the best things I've eaten in a while. There was apple, and some vanilla flavor to it. But I can't even describe how great it tasted. My daughter inhaled the bacon rather quickly and ate a good portion of a very healthy sized pancake. My husband was pleased with the frites, he said they were quite salty, which I think is to be expected when ordering such a dish. 

All in all I would absolutely head back to their brunch. And drink many many more bloody Mary's! Nice work Green House Tavern!"}
{"text":"Quick, Simple and FRESH is the name of the game. Wonderful fully sustainable restaurant and a spark in the night life of fine dining with a not so expensive outcome to any evening or quick lunch during work."}
{"text":"I came here later into the night when there was just the happy hour menu. While sparser than the regular menu, it wasn't short. I wavered between the bucket of fried chicken but was convinced to get the chicken wings confit, which I was told was their staple, and the Cleveland caviar. I don't know if I made the right choice because the fried chicken sure seemed like it would be delicious but I didn't make a bad one.
The wings were only lightly fried. Apparently they're prepared for 12 hours in lard and then flash fried and served with scallions in a jalapeno lime sauce. The pieces were small so it wasn't completely filling but a good portion. The Cleveland caviar was a serving pimento of pimento cheese with crackers and pickles, all separately aligned on a board. The cheese was the standout. It was light and spicy and worked well with the pickles. 
I think the dessert I tried -- the almond and stone fruit -- wasn't satisfying. It's a small portion and not that good. But at least there are good beer options."}
{"text":"NEVER GO HERE. So to start, it was my sisters birthday and everyone decided on a specific restaurant however she liked the chef at green house and insisted on it. It was her birthday so we all agreed. It took us an hour and a half to eat one entree and drink one drink. Our server never checked if our food was good or if we need a dressing. So a bus boy came by and we asked for service after 20 min of waiting to be checked. So back to it being her birthday. We wanted shots which took 20 min. So after 20 min we cancelled them. The manager brought them over and said they were on the house. OK. THANKS. bc we asked for our checks at 8:09. Didn't come get my card until 8:50 on the dot. Needles to say worst service of my life and I will never be back.  Also ruined my sister birthday dinner. So DONT GO HERE."}
{"text":"My first trip to Cleveland and my first visit here.  Of course I checked the Yelp app prior to dinner to find this place.  I loved the pictures and the quirky sense of decor this place has.

Lots of outdoor seating as well as some bench style seating inside the storefront window which is where my wife and I sat.  

The service was incredibly great.  The gentleman that waited on us had worked there for 8 years and it shows.  He knew every nook and cranny of that menu.

My favorite was the beef tartare.  Not only plated in a great way (egg still in its shell) it was likely the most tasteful dish I've had.  In addition to the food they have a solid beer line up as well.

This place is a must visit if in the area."}
{"text":"We had a reservation so we got in very quickly. The decor was interesting and very modern urban chic, not necessarily what I was expecting for the price range, but not an annoyance or anything. The food was very tasty and I like that the use as much local materials as possible. I ordered the corn gnocchi and they make the noodles in house. The only complaint is that the portions are quite small. It was fine for me as I am a petite girl who doesn't need to eat a lot but my husband ordered the walleye entree and it was maybe 3 or 4 oz. Luckily we ordered the pomme frites,  which may have been my favorite food I tried there (they were baked with rosemary and garlic- heavenly!). Anyway, my advice would be to get at least an appetizer per person and an entree or be prepared to need to eat a snack later in the evening."}
{"text":"Love, love, love it.  We have been several times and the food is always spot on.  Love the funky art and layout of the place.  Everything we had was fantastic.  My favorites were the beef tartare and clams.  My husband had the wings and gnocchi.  Everything was well balanced and very flavorful.  Cannot wait to return on our next trip.  Oh, and the staff is excellent.  Couldn't have asked for better service."}
{"text":"I have never seen anything so beautiful in my life. The head of a pig resting obediently on our table, roasted to perfection and waiting to be devoured. I ordered the massive pig's head of the menu.

My heart was pounding out of love and anxiety.  I was instantly seduced by its crispy bbq glazed exterior, but also clouded internally with many questions. Could we finish all the meat? How does eye socket meat taste? Was the pigs name truly 'Wilbur' as the waiter suggested? Slowly those questions of anxiety dissipated into moans of pure joy and happiness. 

*Cut* As if tapping into primal instincts, I ravenously tore into the pigs head using my knife. The search for delicious head meat did not take long. *Bite* Each morsel of pig danced on my palette like a ballerina, activating my soul and enlivening my entire physical being. This was one of the best meals of my life."}
{"text":"I had a few hours downtime around lunch today in downtown Cleveland. I set off on foot planning to visit Symon's Lola (I previously raved about his burger/brats/beer mecca, B Spot.) But, just a few doors over was Sawyer's Greenhouse Tavern. I approached and checked out both menus in the window and apprised the lunchtime vibe.

I picked Greenhouse Tavern, partly to try something new, partly to get a head start on Top Chef, partly because the menu had a good selection of vegetarian, vegan, fish and meat, partly because it was locally sourced... but mainly, I fell in love with the front dining nook where being a single gal at lunchtime, sporting a camera to take food pics seemed perfectly suited.  The food exceeded all expectations, especially the vegetarian options which are sometimes chef afterthoughts...

{"text":"Consistently good food. The short ribs are easily enough for 3 people. This is what we usually order."}
{"text":"Wow. If I could give zero stars I would. This place was extremely underwhelming. Me and my lunch companion were walking down east 4th and decided to stop in for a bite. I ordered a happy hour Ceasar salad ($8) and he ordered the *award winning* lamb Burger($13). With only two other patrons at the bar our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately the food runner dropped everything off and never bothered to to ask if we needed anything else. Hmmm.. not sure how I should eat a salad without silverware... as I wait patiently for a bartender (3 of them are behind the bar talking to each other) to come and check on us so I can get a silverware set I stare mystified at our plates. Imagine a romaine heart, with every decent leaf gone, soaked in dressing with some random stuff. So dissappointing. I don't eat much but it was like eating nothing...

Moving on.. finally flag down a bartender (apparently it's not obvious neither of us are eating our food) get some silverware.  The lamb burger looks like a kid meal from Applebee's served on a side plate with burnt house chips that were pretty much up unedible. The bun is a square and clearly from a pull apart bun bag. The burger was the size of a Wendy's junior burger. Now don't get me wrong I know I'm getting a happy hour price burger ($13???) But seriously... 

So after I finish my beer (only 4 beers on tap?) Even though we were clearly done at least 10/15 minutes before she comes back, to offer me another (never asking how the food actually was?). No thank you. 

I don't usually write reviews, especially negative, but i will not be returning and want to save another patron their time and money."}
{"text":"Plan to come back and try different items. I have came 3 times before tribe games for quick bite. It's almost always busy but people eat and leave at a decent pace to grab a table and make the game. IMe and my wife have only had the lamb burger, regular burger, chicharrones, chicken wings confit and the gravy frites. Everything we tried is exceptional! I love the fresh rosemary sprigs and garlic cloves on the fries. I havent had better fries anywhere. It's also a nice portion compared to some other cleveland chefs. 

The gravy frites were my first time eating poutine. I've always seen poutine on fast food menus in canada and it never seemed like a good idea. I would order them all day at Greenhouse Tavern. Atmosphere is great. You can sit outside, inside, downstairs and watch the cooks etc. Downstairs gets warm in the kitchen, but we got use to it. It's a bit louder than other areas as the expediter and cooks call out menu items ask for times etc. It's cool to see them cooking all this amazing food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town to catch a concert, and we headed here for dinner. Our experience was nothing short of phenomenal. The service was excellent, the ambiance was funky and the food was out of this world.

We shared their chicken wings and smoked cauliflower to start. If you order nothing else on this menu, get the wings. They brought the right amount of heat, balanced by citrus. The cauliflower was great too, though I wish we'd ordered the Brussels sprouts instead.

My wife was full at that point, so she ordered their fries. The fries were garlicky and hit the spot. I ordered the Delmonico steak - it may have been one of the best things I've ever eaten. Well worth the stiff price tag.

We finished the meal by sharing their 'Carmel Corn' brûlée. One of the most unique and delicious desserts we've had.

If you're in Cleveland, you've got to eat here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.  I had the lamb burger with fries.  The lamb wasn't gamey tasting and the fries were spot on delicious.  I really liked the fact that Young Guns was on TV and then Fight Club came on.  It's like this place read my mind of my fav movies.  Beer, meat and action summed up a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Greenhouse gets 5 stars from me for the flavor and originality of the food, and for the extensive liquor selection.  It is extremely rare for me to be legitimately wowed by a dining experience these days, but Greenhouse does it every time with delicious and unexpected flavors and perfectly executed dishes.

It is pricey, though, and the menu is so small that it is sometimes difficult to find something that appeals."}
{"text":"The fella and I went here for a pre-show dinner inand had an excellent time. We went all out with the five course tasting selection and, while they were out of many of our first picks, we just embraced some more creative choices and were super pleased with all of them. 

Starters included a beet salad, kale salad, and I also had pomme frites. The boyfriend had a melon kombucha dish, duck wings confit, greenhouse salad, and the Properly Butchered Rib Steak.

My taste-buds were super happy the entire time! I ordered the Fred Flinstone short rib for my main entree which was COMICALLY enormous (and I had even read reviews beforehand... what was I thinking?!) but devine. I had leftovers for days, making five more meals-worth out of it.  

I will admit I got a little jealous of the table next to us as their server was much more forthcoming with information about the menu and recommending various dishes but our server was nice and, to be fair, I could have asked more questions. All in all, we had a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. We got to sit in the basement right in front of the kitchen and watch the magic happen. So much fun. Chef Jonathon showed me how he makes sauerkraut and it was MAGICAL!!!!! So much fun. I recommend."}
{"text":"We did Sunday brunch and bloody Mary's here yesterday. The food and service were both outstanding. I'm surprised it doesn't have better ratings on yelp, given our experience. I can vouch for brunch at least!  Check it out."}
{"text":"Location, location, location! Great atmosphere, cozy and trendy.  Drinks were great and chicken wing appetizer was very tasty, tender and big enough to share.  Burger was dry overdone and charred. Fries were sitting in a stainless tray of some sort under a heat lamp anxiously awaiting to be served to us.  They were soggy, somewhat warm and had a nice sprig of rosemary on top.  The pig in a pie or something like that, was 2 overly done thick  dry pork chops, potato square was very crisp and apple pie.  The dish apparently was steeped altogether to get a broth for the bottom of my plate.  Problem was it was so reduced and concentrated that it was a salty burnt reduction that caused the whole plate to taste the same.  
I'm sure that if chef was preparing these dishes it would be incredible.  Unfortunately that was not our case. 
2 stars for potentially a great experience."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good service. 
Cocktail menu is small.
Chicken wings were amazing. They fell off the bone, and had great flavor.
Brussels sprouts were also very good. The aioli and mint added to them made them unique and delicious.
The pork chops entree was over cooked and nothing special. My husband got short ribs, they were pretty good, but we felt both entrees were overpriced for what we got. 
I think if we come back, we'll just get appetizers and go somewhere different for dinner because the entree prices were steep and didn't seem to fill you up."}
{"text":"I came here on a random weekday night, and I must say I'm glad I made a reservation! The place was still busy, which means one thing...the food must be good, right?!

My friends and I all opted for the four course tasting menu. It's definitely worth the $44, and we got to try each other's dish. Warning= one should probably come here with an empty stomach because the portions are pretty big. And by your fourth course, you will wishing you wore your more stretchy pair of jeans!

Firsts= Crispy Fried Lake Erie Smelts- I enjoyed the smelt, it was light and not too oily and the sauce added a little sweetness to it. 
Escabeche of Broccoli Salad- Was refreshing and the first time I've ever had pickles in my salad! If you aren't a fan of pickles or a slightly sour taste in your salad, I suggest you pick a different dish

Seconds=Hand Ground Beef Tartar- I'm not a big fan of raw meat, but since my friend loves tartar I gave it a try. It was actually quite good, and tasted quite fresh. And since I'm still alive to write this review, we can safely say that it was prepared well! :p I ate the beef without the relish and it was still quite tasty, especially on crispy toasted bread. 
Stuffed Semolina Pasta- I expected a little more from the dish, so I was surprised when two pieces of pasta came out. It was a little dry for my taste. 

Halfs= Pommes Frites= I liked the fries with rosemary and aioli sauce. It would be nice if they had multiple aioli sauces available though, just to kick it up a notch.
Gravy Frites= This is basically poutine, and I love poutine! I didn't even have to go all the way to Canada for it it either! ey!

Thirds= Roasted Pig Head- Totally worth every penny of the $44+ that I paid! The meat was so so so tender and marinated with an amazing sauce. This is definitely a diet buster, so ladies....just close your eyes and dig in because it's worth every extra mile you have to run! REMEMBER to tell your server ahead of time to start preparing the pig head for you, because it takes a while to cook. 

Dessert= Palet d'or- Very delicious chocolate cake. I love ganache, so I would probably order this again....that is, if I had any room left after \"pigging\" out!"}
{"text":"Rooftop bar is grungy, half of the strung lights are burned out or missing, bathroom might as well be an outhouse. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food or drinks! The woman who was standing at the hostess area did not greet us and was hot on the phone for about 10 minutes. By that time, another woman came along, who worked behind the bar.  So we gave up on a table, and just sat at the bar. And she wasn't really busy, so that can't be the reason for ignoring us... But ignore us she did! After about another 15 minutes maybe even 20 we just decided to leave. Cleveland has lots of restaurants, and this one was not cheap, but we wanted to try it. I have traveled for years and can truly say this was maybe the worst example of service I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Greenhouse Tavern, located on Cleveland's fun and trendy E. 4th Street, came to me loaded with expectations.  Chef/Owner Jonathon Sawyer was voted Cleveland's top new chef last year, and Greenhouse has been featured in publications outside of Cleveland as one of the most exciting restaurants anywhere.

We arrived a few minutes prior to our 7 o'clock reservation and took a seat at the bar.  My first impression of Greenhouse Tavern was the disparity of decor between the two long walls (the restaurant is no more than 20 feet wide and probably 100 feet deep).  On one wall, behind the bar, were miles of bottles - wine, beer, and liquor - nestled in what appeared to be reclaimed wood shelves.  On the other side of the restaurant, miles of  monochromatic paint.  It was oddly dull in contrast with the fun bar side.

My wife and I ordered a draft cider and a brown ale respectively, while we waited for the rest of our party.  Our bartender was friendly and attentive.

When it did come time to sit down to dinner, we were walked to the back of the main floor so that we could ascend some stairs.  Most of the dining tables here are on the second level, in a small section in the very front, and a similarly small section in the very back.  To get to our section in the back, we went up what appeared to be a fire escape.  Metal stairs with metal railing.  The walls were painted red to help make it appear more finished, but this was not a finished space.  As we entered the fire escape, I saw two members of the kitchen staff dragging a huge bus tub of uneaten food scraps, across the ground just outside.  Not an appetizing sight.

We were seated along one of the long walls, the ladies in what looked to be a reclaimed Church pew, and the men in chairs.  I had to be asked to scoot in at least a dozen times to make room for wait staff and patrons to get between my chair and the person's behind me.  The layout of tables required this.  This is just unacceptable when you are dining at a restaurant that is supposed to be one of the best in Cleveland.

On to the food... I can talk about quite a bit of food, as we are a share-happy group.  And some of it was quite good.  I was moderately impressed with the chicken wings and the devils on horseback (bacon wrapped dates).  Less impressive but still perfectly good were the foie gras clams, the fifth quarter (mac 'n' cheese w/ chicken livers), and the Bread and Butter - just grilled bread with butter.

Unacceptable, though, were two of the entrees, the steak frites and the pork chop.  The steak was something out of a Denny's or Waffle House.  No more than 3/4\" thick, slightly overcooked (it's tough to cook a steak this thin mid-rare), stringy, and flavorless.  The buerre rouge was good, but I shouldn't have to dip my steak into a flavored melted butter in order to enjoy it.  The pork chops were even worse.  1/3\" thick, dry, like crackers.  The frites were just fries.  No salt on them, and no salt on the table.  Yet, there was probably an entire teaspoon of rock salt in my wife's pot du creme.  

The final straw was the couple next to us.  The \"gentleman\" who was sitting next to me, one table over, had his left foot up on the \"Church Pew\" that my wife and this guy's gal were both sitting on.  His shoe was completely filthy, untied, and disgusting.  One reason you go to a restaurant that costs some money is to avoid the riff-raff.  Not so, here.

The pot du creme was good, by the way.  The salt was well placed.  My Jeni's ice cream, which was cognac soaked figs in goat cheese ice cream, was very unique and delicious.  

But overall, our dining experience came up far short of expectations.  I mean, it wasn't even close.  I have had dozens of better meals at far less \"exciting\" restaurants.

In summary, I can't help but to think that Greenhouse Tavern is just riding the hype wave, and that a lot of Clevelanders have bought into that hype.  Our friends had been here two other times, and their most recent visit (before this one) was terrible.  They thought it was just an anomaly, but it wasn't.  Greenhouse Tavern's approach is a display of arrogant environmentalism.  Their mission statement is more concerned with sustainability than it is with good food - you can read it for yourself.  A restaurant's mission must always first be great food.  That Jonathon Sawyer thinks otherwise is evident in his mediocre food.

A huge, huge disappointment.  So many better options around town."}
{"text":"Yum!  The service and food were excellent!  I could honestly eat an entire portion of the confit chicken wings myself and this dish was really the star of the meal.  We also tried the gravy fries, broccolini, and the pork chop.  Loved everything but man, these are some heavy items, fully of porky and meaty goodness.  I was quite glad that I shared everything with a friend, and would've honestly still been full if we had ordered one less small plate.  Also, shout out to our super awesome server Alice who was delightful, kind, and attentive, despite juggling SEVERAL tables during the Saturday night rush.

So, the lesson is to order a whole bunch of fun plates and share with friends!  And yes, the cocktails are quite gorgeous too.  Can't wait to come back to polish off another plate of the confit wings."}
{"text":"AMAZING WINGS!!!! Upon touch, they literally fall off the bone. No side sauce is needed because they are perfectly seasoned and completely flavorful!!!! Absolutely wonderful service, the waiter was always timely and attentive. Definitely a must have! 

Also the environment is so chill and spacious!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience. My girl friend and I went for Valentines Day last year. I'm not a very adventurous eater, so I got the Steak Frites, it was really good. She got some sort of pork chop that she said was really good. There was some really crazy sounding shit on the menu, but I didn't try any of that. The prices weren't too bad either. We didn't drink much and I think our tab was under $100."}
{"text":"I think I was unlucky here. I was part of a group (~8 people) that had arrived at different times and we were sitting outside on a Sunday evening, which they may have been expecting to be quieter than it actually was.

However, when we were ordering food, the waitress took orders from everyone other than me, then took the menus away.

After we'd had a couple of beers, she stopped asking if we wanted more.  When we asked for the bill to be split, it took the best part of an hour as the overworked waitress presented us with one bill, then walked away for a few minutes and did other things before coming back with the next, and so on.  Eventually we had to go and hang out near the cash register to pay (or get change), those of less patience were strongly suggesting we walked off.

I wanted to like this place, but left extremely disappointed.  The only reason it has two stars is for the reasonable selection of beer.  It was otherwise overpriced and with poor service."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland last Thursday for the Cavs' opening night LBJ homecoming game.  My buddy Ryan said that we just had to go to The Greenhouse Tavern for the wings.  So we went.  Sweet Jesus.  While not a one-percenter when it comes to my wings, I eat 'em a fair amount and these were the single-best order of wings I have ever had, replacing the grilled wings at Hard Times Cafe in the greater DC area as my top-slot wing.  So perfect, meat fell off the bone, the right amount of spices without being overwhelming.  Also tried an order of the pomme frites, and if you are going to eat french fries, eat them at Greenhouse...damn.  I know this food was good because we heard that about an hour after we left, Beyonce and Jay-Z showed up for dinner.  I don't know when I'll be back in town but when I go I will be at that place!"}
{"text":"The steak tartare was on point and paired very nicely with the beets. A little on the pricier side for the service you receive, but the creativity and quality of the menu make up for it.  They also have a great rooftop and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a graduation celebration.

I wasn't that impressed by the atmosphere (in part because we were initially seated next to a large group that was way too loud, we had to ask to be reseated).  The service was good, but unexceptional.

The food, though, was fantastic.  I had the Spring Pasta, which was satisfying and flavorful, without the over-reliance on cheese that characterizes many pasta dishes.  My sister had the steak, which was thick and perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  The dessert options were good, too, I shared the chocolate mousse (an interesting presentation; they serve a small bowl of very dark chocolate mousse with a plate of sweeter items on the side to mix and dip)."}
{"text":"The quickest way to sum it up is, \"YUCK!\" We were a table of four, and only one was satisfied with their meal. Maybe we ordered wrong? I can't imagine a James Beard judge trying an order of chickpea stew or the veggie burger and thinking it was edible, let alone award-worthy. The veggie burger took up only 1/4th of available bun space. Maybe that was a good thing, as the bun tasted better than that burger. The best thing about the restaurant was the French fries. Not the first time they came out, but when we sent them back for hot ones. Our server was nice, so there's that. But if you think you're going to have a quick lunch during your lunch break, think again. Slooooow. Lots to choose from in the area. I strongly suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic, just about every time I come to town I eat here. The staff has always been great, the food and beverage choices, including, but not limited to beer and cocktail choices are fabulous! As a worldwide traveler, it's comforting knowing that there is always a \"go-to\" when you arrive in town."}
{"text":"I am an soulful individual. I appreciate good food and drink. I get excited when local chefs do inspiring things in and out of their kitchen. In his first solo venture, Chef Jonathan Sawyer has outdone himself. 

If you're a fan of Greenhouse, you know the story: Jonathan Sawyer, Food & Wine's 2010 \"Best New Chef\", has worked alongside the great Charlie Palmer in NY and Michael Symon here in Cleveland. Chef/Partner of Bar Cento turned restaurateur in his opening of The Greenhouse Tavern; a business based on using local ingredients, sustainable food and environmentally conscious practices. An ambitious project that has seemed to pay off. 

Cleveland Beer Week and a private 6 course tasting brought me and a couple friends to The Greenhouse for a recent indulgence of bliss and excess. What follows is an account of one of the most enjoyable meals and experiences in public dining that I can think of in recent memory....

The tasting was to take place in the basement. A large square table with 12 seats, 4 on each side was prepared for our arrival. Just past the dining table was the kitchen. It ran like a well oiled machine. If you've ever seen Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen TV show, this kitchen was nothing like that. There was no screaming or chastising. Instead, the cooks moved in symphony as the chef conducted them. Pushed against the rear wall were shelves stocked with autumn's seasonal bounty of gourds, pumpkins and squash of many varieties, colors and sizes. On the other wall, a vintage jukebox. The exclusivity of our group and the setting were enough to foreshadow the experience that would surely follow. 

Before each meal, a beer sommelier gave a brief history of each beer we would sample. Next, Johnathan Sawyer himself spoke to us about each dish that was paired with the beer. The same pattern followed throughout the night. What resulted was a memorable night of information, enlightenment, excellent food and exemplary beer. The menu was as follows:

First Course paired with a Reissdorf Kolch:
Heirloom pork & ricotta meatballs, duck devils on horseback, Ohio black walnut soup & tasty bits. 

Second Course paired with La Douze:
Foie gras tourchon w/ endive apricot chutney

Third Course paired with Hitachino White:
Beer Vin Mackeral Crudo w/ coriander barley cake

Forth Course paired with Taquamari:
Duck and Squash Pasta

Palatte Cleanse: 
Red and White Beer Granita

Fifth Course paired with Aventinus:
Veal w/ cherry sauce & polenta

Dessert paired with Sarasola Sagardoa Basque Cider:
Apple tart titan w/ salty carmel ice cream

In recounting the entire meal, a few standouts were the black walnut soup, the foie gras tourchon and the duck squash pasta.  

In memory and context alone, this meal stands among a short list of best I've ever had. The food, drink and accompanying knowledge behind it made it even better. Welcome to my Top 3 in the CLE List Greenhouse Tavern. You deserve it!"}
{"text":"Loved the rigatoni!!! I thought I would be left hungry since it's meat-free but it was absolutely amazing and filling! I am already planning my return because I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I had the regular beef burger and my husband had the lamb burger. I'm not even a fan of lamb but I took a bite out of my husband's and it was so good. A lamb lover like my husband devoured his. When the waitress first put the plates down, my husband and I both looked at each other thinking there's no way we are going to get full from this since it wasn't this huge burger... surprisingly it was really filling! And I loved sitting on the window table. For appetizer, we ordered some mushroom thing with an egg on it. Very good. And for dessert, we had the popcorn. Holy cow. I can't even describe it because I will start salivating. Sorry. You're just gonna have to go there and try it."}
{"text":"Finally a spa for men, kinda.  Greenhouse tavern has a great beer selection, a wall full of classic VHS movies and a menu that pays homage to the magical animal, the pig.  Also, most of my servers have been gay so it's me and not my lovely wife who gets all the flirty attention for a change.

I will admit, the first time I went to the Greenhouse Tavern I was not too impressed (my fault not theirs).  The Mrs. and I were just looking to get a drink and a small bite to eat, but mostly the drinks.  We ordered the Crispy Chicken Wing Confit, Ratatouille and Pommes Fritas.  While the food was delicious it was very rich and the selections we made were all on the salty/savory side.  Not that the dishes were over salted, they were just salty dishes.  An ordering mistake we would not make again.  

We decided to give the tavern another chance the following week.  This time we got the seasonal peaches, pork chop saltimboca, some sort of salad with bacon hunks in it, and of course drinks.  While I could go on and on about the peach and bacon flavor-explosion in my mouth or the well seasoned salad, the part of the meal that I was talking about for days was the pork chop.  Seriously, days later my wife had to finally tell me to talk about something besides the damn pork chop.  The dish was not what I expected.  It came out on a plate swimming in a thin gravy, which I would soon find out is the source of all things wonderful on this planet.  Every bite of the chop was flavorful, the pork chop was tender and had hints of ham and bacon essence infused in it via red eye gravy.  It's like a turducken except all the animals are magical swine eager to make sweet savory love to your taste buds.  See there I go again, talking about that pork chop.

The wait staff is very knowledgeable about the ever evolving menu (both beer and food) and are happy to make suggestions, especially to me since I'm the cute one for a change.

Man, I can't stop thinking about that chop..."}
{"text":"Amazing bartenders, beer list and cocktails!  We sat at the bar and Shawn and Austin entertained us crafting delicious drinks that paired with our appetizers and dinners.   Recently moved to Ohio and found my favorite local spot!!"}
{"text":"The menu was so hard to decipher and the burger I had didn't have any taste at all. Really disappointing. Service was good but the food didn't seem worth the price. Really don't understand why so much fuzz about this place."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Not a lot to add that other reviewers haven't mentioned.  Was there on 4/22/14 and got the wings, kale salad, and veggie burger. Everything was great.  Excellent atmosphere - interesting and lively but not too loud."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. 

In 2011 I lived on E. 4th St. in Cleveland. Because this restaurant is across the street, I visited all. the. time. For drinks. For apps. For Happy Hour. For the rooftop patio. For dinner. For lunch. For the tasting menu. I've honestly not had a bad experience at this restaurant. 

As the menu frequently changes, it's very hard to recommend \"favorites\" off the menu. That being said, the crispy chicken wings confit with roasted jalapeno, lemon juice, scallion & garlic have changed my world. As multiple reviewers have described, these wings fall of the bone like no other wings I've ever had. They're not covered in a thick, sickening sauce. They're fried, but taste oh so fresh. They're amazing. The pair perfectly with the gravy frites with mozzarella curd, pepper, and brown gravy. I may be in the minority, but I prefer the plain gravy frites to the animal frites. I can't tell you how many times my husband and I have shared these two plates at the bar at the GHT with a few beers.

I honestly believe you can't go wrong with anything you order of this menu. It's not the most inexpensive restaurant in Cleveland, but it's certainly one of the best."}
{"text":"This place is great. Was visiting from LA and stumbled upon this gem. Drinks can't be beat and the lamb burger and Brussels sprouts were nothing short of perfection. A DT Cleveland gem no doubt."}
{"text":"No long, drawn out, detailed description of my many meals there needed. This is by far one of the best restaurants in downtown Cleveland. The food it excellent, the drinks...delicious, the servers are very good at what they do and the atmosphere makes it one of my favorite dining experiences in town!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I wanted to try this place. My taste buds must just tingle a bit differently than Clevelanders because this isn't the first restaurant where I've had a different opinion. I haven't reviewed a restaurant in awhile, but felt compelled to write one for the greenhouse tavern since it was the worst contemporary/\"fine\" dining I've had in awhile.

We got the tasting menu, with an additional $8 for the Chicken entree.


Firsts: Got the Devils on Horseback and Fromage Blanc. The Devils were really good, probably the best dish of the evening and perhaps set up the disappointment for the rest of it...It had great flavour, texture and the presentation was nice. The Fromage was ok, a bit like cream cheese.

Seconds: Crispy Chicken Wings Confits and Foie Gras Steamed Clams. The chicken wings were the 2nd best dish of the night. They were flavourful and crispy and the added scallions/jalapeno was a nice different touch. The clams...well I'm sure they would be good but they were severely overpowered with the sauce which all we could taste was butter, and it was salty. We poured out the sauce from the clam shells when we ate them because it was just too buttery.

Thirds: Had their signature Half Chicken in Brioche Bread and the Market Fish (halibut, I think). The fish was pretty good, I only tried a bit so I can't review it all. The chicken smelled great. Had some spices and like some reviewers said, it was really juicy. Too bad the damn thing was oversalted!! I couldn't even eat more than 4 mouthfuls because all I tasted was salt. I could feel my blood pressure rising after every bite!

Halfs: Gravy Frites. I got it on the recommendation of yelpers even though I should've known better (I'm from Canada, so I've had real poutine). These weren't too salty, tho maybe I couldn't tell after all the salt intake from the chicken. However, it was bland, the worst poutine/remake of poutine I've ever had. I don't think the cheese curds were real or maybe they were just bad and there wasn't enough gravy/it wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds. If anyone's been to Harvey's in Canada, even they have better poutine (and it's a fast food chain).

Dessert: Carmel Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme. Meh, looked kinda plain and it tasted pretty plain. Basically some chocolate mousse on the bottom layer and a heavy caramel top layer.

The good thing is the portions are generous, and the tasting menu is a \"steal\". However, it'd be nice if we enjoyed more than a few dishes. Like a previous poster said, it should be called the Salthouse Tavern. I've never tasted so much salt in any meal before. What happened to balancing flavours?? Ok back to drinking water because all this salt has my mouth dry."}
{"text":"I ate here about 2 years ago and it was my top dining experiences in Cleveland. Two years have passed and nothing has changed. 

This place has to be one of the top ten restaurants I have ever eaten at. It's simply amazing that they pull off such a complex array of flavors to perfection year after year.

The service can be a bit uptight at times, but they have every right. Their crap don't smell.

If you're within 30 miles of this place, it's worth the trip. 

Jeff's tip: If you use the valet, be prepared for some thug sh*t. Parking is $8 and there is nothing stating tipping is encouraged. They only have to walk 10 seconds to get your car. However, they'll be happy to stand 3 inches from your driver's door until some green back meet their palm. To hell with that. I stiffed em!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends on a Saturday (their website said they were closed on Saturdays but when we walked by, they were open so we were able to pop in). Service was good, and bloody marys were spicy! I had the strawberry rhubarb pancakes which were good though thin and charred in places. Confit chicken wings were delicious and the hash got good reviews. I also love the atmosphere. Food covered all ends of the spectrum but the atmosphere is fun and drinks are good."}
{"text":"It was my husbands birthday and wanted to take him some place \"different\"..Called the restaurant a week prior to driving over from Chicago.. Went over the menu with a knowledgable staff member and had it all planned out, no problem I thought..Did the 5 1/2 hour drive there Tues. night July 3rd..Had a 7:30 reservation, all good then I told them who we were and told them our order...I was told at that point that they were out of 2 of the main items we drove there for....Needless to say I was pissed!!!!!  Was then told If I had come on the weekend I could have gotten what we wanted......I will NEVER GO BACK  !!!!!!!!!! What we ended up with was OK but totally overpriced ( the chicken).Service was good,cocktail list was nice, atmosphere was fine but ugh???  Standard fare I could have gotten In my own back yard....."}
{"text":"read on an article that this is one of the top 10 best spots for  wings in the u.s.. and every time we visit Cleveland i always  wanted to try them out,  so finally made plans with some local friends. 
Maybe it was the hype or the too long of waiting, but I thought the wings were ok. i didn't think it was the best  wings I've ever had, i was a bit disappointed,  maybe i had too high of an expectation.  Next time


  I probably would order other items on their menu, but their frys are super delish"}
{"text":"I found East 4th Street in downtown Cleveland to contain the treasure trove of great Cleveland eateries.  The Greenhouse Tavern is definitely a good find.

The place has a fun atmosphere with bikes hanging from the ceiling - a little scary and a little odd as I couldn't understand the theme - and GREAT food.  The service could use some help but our meal made up for it.

A MUST is the Fred Flintstone plate - a HUGE GIGANTIC plate of ribs - as it seriously looked like something a caveman would eat.  They were so good and we had to take half the plate home.

If in Cleveland again, Greenhouse will definitely be on my list."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and every visit gets better and better. The first time I just went for drinks. They make a pretty good Old Fashion, and they have a decent wine selection. The second time we just ordered apps. The pomme frites are to die for... Don't leave without trying. The tabasco chicken falls off the bone- I highly recommend trying. But the third time I went was by far the best, and the reason this place gets 4 stars. The. Wings. I dream about those things. They melt in your mouth... They are heaven flavored. If I were on death row and I had one last meal request, these would be it. The end."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in CLE. Go for lunch and get the steak ceasar salad. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Get the crispy chicken wings! 

Great venue on possibly the only street with nightlife in Cleveland, Ohio. It's located right next to Lola, which is another must-try for me. It was great sitting outside while listening to some Blues streaming out from the House of Blues next door.

Seafood is not recommended here; they're more of a meatery, so order one of those and you're set. If we had more time, I would have ordered one of the slow-roasted offerings, but we arrived only an hour before closing. 

This is a pretty chill, old school looking pub/restaurant with great food and ambiance. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Gotta update this mofo. Went here last weekend with a friend from out of town that has fancy (cough expensive cough) taste in food. She suggested this place, and who am I to disagree with a lady? The strip steak I had was absolutely one of the finest meals I've had in Cleveland. And the appetizer and drink selection is superb. I probably wouldn't eat here once a month, but if you want to treat yourself (and other people, I guess), this is one of those places to do it."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh so so tried to up change $2 bucks when I asked for a drink on the rocks.  Burbon sour $16!!!???? Food Ehhhhh ok good chicken wings wow."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday (and have been here a few times in the past) and the food was very good.  They also have a good bottle list and a few interesting beers on tap.  For starters we had the hummus which came with a very tasty bread and a bunch of pickled vegetables.  The pickled veggies and bread were the highlight.  The hummus was just okay.  For entrees, my husband had the banh mi and loved it.  Our nephew had the chickpea stew which he seemed to enjoy, although it looked small.  I had the vegetarian bbq \"pork\" sandwich which was fantastic.  It was basically shredded mushrooms with a slaw and bbq sauce on it, but it was so smokey and delicious.  My only complaint is that there could have been a bit more of the \"meat\" on the sandwich because the bun was quite large.  Not a big complaint though as the food was very good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I ate here - for reals this time. My husband LOVES this spot so we had dinner. 

Started with the brussel sprouts appetizer and it did not disappoint. They basically melt in your mouth.

He had the pork chop which is his favorite and I had the burger. Both delicious. 

Lastly we finished off with desserts - Boca negra and dobos torte - BOTH AMAZING. Yes we ordered two desserts. We were on vacation. So neener neener. Back to the desserts - both were amazing. The Boca negra comes with honey lavender ice cream that is so crave-able. It is paired perfectly with the balsamic flavors in the cake. YUM. 

I just love this place."}
{"text":"For being rated a top restaurant, it was fairly disappointing. For food we would rate 3/5, for service we would rate 1/5. We were a table of 9 and although some of us had some decent food (the fries were great), but overall the food was really salty (steak was salty, chicken wings were salty). The halibut was not fresh and was actually inedible. Our friend who had the halibut couldn't eat more than one bite due to the rotten nature of the fish and the waiter didn't ask any of our party how our food was the entire time we sat there. The waiter avoided eye contact with the halibut patron and although in the end he didn't charge her for her fish, she was never asked what was wrong or whether he could do something. It was absolutely terrible service. The atmosphere was nice, but it was very overpriced for mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"LOVE everything Jonathan Sawyer but Greenhouse is such a gem.  The food is always unique, high-quality, and delicious.  Wish they served food on the rooftop patio but always make time to stop by for a quick drink, especially on the weekends when people-watching is at its prime.  Will return, along with Noodlecat, and Trentina, again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on Friday with 5 co-workers. Wasn't very crowded when we arrived so we expected to get in and out.

We waited over 50 minutes for our food. It was excruciating. When we asked the waitress if it would be ready soon, she was visibly upset. They took 15% off the bill, but that was hardly a consolation after an almost hour wait.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich special with salt & vinegar house chips. The chips were fantastic, but the sandwich was mediocre at best - the pork tasted like sweaty gym socks.

Food was not cheap and overall experience was not a good one. I will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Just so-so?Don't take the pictures too seriously. We ordered the clam, chicken wings and animal style fries. We love the fries which is so rich with bacon, cheese, and eggs. However, the so called Best-ever chicken wings tasted only so~~ur. Too much lemon juice on it and not tasty at all. Perhaps the pig face is good, but we didn't try. Just feel the food isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"This farm-table place is worth a road trip!  I had the best meal of our four day #Christmas weekend trip.  For lunch-- I had mussels, french fries with aloi and brussels-- all to die for.  I had a Kentucky burbon beer with lunch and an americano for dessert.  The children were happy with their lamb burgers.  I was in such food heaven I have no idea what my husband ate.  The decor is lovely-- an artsy repurposed old building.  Walking to the restrooms -- the open kitchen is a sight to see.  The location is great if you are on your way to the #rockandrollhalloffame like we were.  #chifoodie #foodtourism #cleveland #clevelandrocks"}
{"text":"This might be one of the finest eating establishments I have found along my travels.  It says a lot when a quarter of the bar is trading plates with strangers just because everyone wants everyone else to experience the magic if what they are eating.

I can't say enough good things about this place. The service was fantastic and everything on the menu is exquisite.  Most of all though the company i find at the bar has always been exemplary."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not into the IPA scene so from a beer standpoint I was disappointed. I chose one at random and wasn't impressed with the taste.

My wife took one sip of hers and that's all she could handle.

To each his own. 

We stopped in shortly before closing time and found the service to be a bit below expectations. Most of the employees were busy cleaning tables and stocking shelves. I don't blame them but it certainly wasn't an inviting atmosphere.

The other patrons looked about as miserable as we did.

Again, not my scene so I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"We had the wings confit, filet tartar and brussel sprouts and everything was amazing! Sat at the bar in the downstairs kitchen and the kitchen staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Came around early spring with the bf after we both got out of work on a weeknight.  We were looking for a quick snack and a beer or two just to unwind before the commute home.  For such modest requests, we expected the famed Greenhouse Tavern to easily wow us.  Alas, we were vastly underwhelmed.

Remembering Lola's bone marrow appetizer fondly, we went for the Warm Bread and Butter Board as an appetizer to share (more than ample for 2 people) and a brew each: the house pilsner for me, Dogfish IPA for the mister.  The house pilsner was flat and very soapy; the Dogfish IPA was also on the flat side. The Bread and Butter Board was fairly good--not exceptional but decent for $15.  Different textured fresh breads and crackers with meat-flavored, buttery, fatty spreads, one of them literally whipped in lard.  But then again, if you can screw something like that up, you probably shouldn't be on 4th Street.

The service was uneven and the space, oddly crowded in certain corners.  The space was obviously a renovated boutique.  We sat in one of the nooks on the ground level, walled by shop glass, feeling claustrophobic and more than a little like mannequins on display.  Our server wasn't too knowledgeable about the menu but allowed us to sample different beers before placing our orders--props to her.  She also allowed us to order the beers and appetizer at the half-off Happy Hour bar-seating-only prices, despite the fact we were sitting away from the bar in the semi-privacy of the nook.  We were mostly neglected however once our orders arrived.  There must have been at least five servers clustered by the bar, chatting and flipping through their smartphones while we were there.  Follow-up was nearly impossible.

The ambiance was casual and the upper/loft seating looked intimate and elegant--we might try to snag a table up there next time.  Weren't too impressed with the \"green\" theme; other than the strained, rustic decor--heaps of wood furniture manufactured to look like rough-hewn tree stumps, branches, etc.--nothing else struck us as particularly eco-friendly.  Especially not the offering of foie gras and other imported, gourmet delicacies on the menu.

Still, the experience wasn't terrible.  Happy hour on a weekday perhaps isn't the Greenhouse's forte.  We'll probably be back to give it another run, with more extensive dining plans in mind."}
{"text":"More like 4.5 stars, but I didn't have that option.  Greenhouse Tavern was another of our must hit places in Cleveland during our short weekend trip.  This place was laid back, casual, and very homey.  Service was pretty slow, but our waiter had 2 other huge parties, so we understood.  We enjoyed the experience nonetheless.

We started with couple of small plates - Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) and Foie Gras Steamed Clams - both were delicious!  We soaked up the warm bread they served us with the juice from the clams...can you say foodgasm?  

We then had the Chicken Wing Confit....great twist on the buffalo wings.  The meat was falling off the bones and it had a great kick with a hint of what tasted like lemon grass.

I ordered the Garlic Chive Risotto, which was great, but a little cheesy for my taste, and my BF ordered the granddaddy of them all....The Roasted Pig Head.  OMG this plate was so huge and he had a half of a pig head on his plate, teeth and all.  The meat was so tender and the fat just melted in your mouth.  I think he did a hell of a job finishing that all by himself.

Like we did at Lola, we shared 3 desserts between us - Buttered Popcorn Pot de Creme, Vegan Chocolate Custard, and the Johnnycake.  Very small portions, but very tasty.  The chocolate custard was my favorite out of the three.

It's definitely a place I would go back to if we're ever back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"2 words: Rooftop Bar!

I have only ever drank at The Greenhouse Tavern, but the food, from what I've seen and smelled, looks up-to-par. 

What I go for is the rooftop bar and patio area, which overlooks E 4th Street. It's a great set up. I sip on wine and enjoy the views of downtown Cleveland's coolest, most happenin' street. I never seem to have a hard time finding a seat. The vibe is great and the booze is better. The help is always friendly and attentive to your wants. 

It's a great place to just hang out on the rooftop and have great conversation with friends. It's a great place for groups."}
{"text":"Normally out of my price range but some local friends brought me here when I visited Cleveland and I'm so glad they did! Great atmosphere, and though the entrees are expensive my meal was worth it! I had the strip steak with pommes frites and some wings as an app. Also a large drink list - I enjoyed some Brooklyn Summer Ales sitting out front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations! Everything our server recommended was delicious, including the wings (amazing!), rib steak, and popcorn-infused custard. Great atmosphere and service, too!"}
{"text":"Interesting spin on foods. The dippings for the fries were all yummy. I really enjoyed this place. The ginger drinks and garlic parmesan fries were my favorite part"}
{"text":"returned to greenhouse last winter for the first time in a couple of years and have been back a few time since.. the service has been wonderful everytime and the food has been amazing.. took all my guy bartenders before a game last fall and most said it was the best meal they had ever had...  a great place to go to share some apps and drink great beers...  ps would be 5 stars but please get some sort of diet soda....  not a tea drinker and i try to stay away from sugar pop.."}
{"text":"Now, as a vegetarian, I realize that going to a restaurant like The Greenhouse Tavern is like ordering spaghetti at a Chinese restaurant, but I still hoped to have a halfway decent experience. But I was SO wrong. 

I went to The Greenhouse Tavern on a happening Thursday night with my friend for her birthday. We'd heard such great things about the restaurant, and we thought it would be a great place to try out. 

Like the last reviewer, even with my reservation we got seated in perhaps the worst table in the house. Good thing I'm not claustrophobic! After what seemed like forever, our server came over to take our drink orders. I had the Sun Dried Martini ($9), which ended up being the best part of my meal. My friend had an IPA which she didn't care for. 

Again, we waited for our server (who had an odor about him) to come back to our table. In the mean time, we were brought bread with some sort of pork butter. My friend tried it and said it tasted like bad tuna salad. 

My dining companion decided on the foie gras and clams ($13) and the tomato soup ($6). We got an order of the $3.00 bread and butter to split. After asking our waiter about the mysterious \"vegetarian entree\" listed on the menu, he described the two options available - vegan and vegetarian, and I decided to go with the vegan option ($15). 

It's a good thing I had a snack before dinner. It took forever for our food to come out. The bread and butter? Burned. My meal? Not at all like what the waiter described. I'd expected to get some fresh veggies over fresh white beans. I got a couple tomatoes, some olives, and a hodge podge of other things on top of some random greens. It was mediocre at best and the portion was comically small. My friend really enjoyed her soup - it was the best part of her meal - but our server brought her mussels instead of clams. She had to convince him that he's brought her mussels and not clams (although the two look nothing a like). Once she got her \"real\" meal, she said she did like the clams better than the mussels. 

Overall, it was a really disappointing service. Considering that the restaurant wasn't all that busy, I would have expected much better service. I'd also expect a server to be able to describe a dish to someone correctly. Personal hygiene is also an important factor for waitstaff. I can say that I'll never be back to The Greenhouse. I respect the concept and the vision behind the restaurant, but I can't bring myself to spend money in a place where service is so terrible."}
{"text":"Fantastic drinks and food. On a very cool street in Cleveland too."}
{"text":"Alice our server was amazing. Each course was divine!! I'm not vegetarian and I LOVED the fried brussel sprouts!! Delicious. You can't miss with this place."}
{"text":"Delicious Sunday brunch. Yelp showed this place as closed but we were so excited to find it open. We are outside on the patio. Lots of Bloody Mary's, mimosas, and bomb food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good quality food with unique ingredients and flavors. Atmosphere is cool--would be good for drinks, dinner, or lunch. The poutine and lamb burger were amazing, as were the whiskey drinks.

They do not have normal soda on tap and it is probably not a good place for conservative eaters who like simple dishes. Great though if your taste is a little more eclectic!"}
{"text":"Food ok. Horrible service. Waited forever for food and over medium eggs were hard as rocks. Had to ask three times for more iced tea.  Never once came by for refills and one time after being asked filled glass with tea minus any ice. Offered to get me something else after I refused eggs but after 45 minutes waiting for food had no interest. Might have helped if they offered to comp a drink or two. Come to Cleveland often for business and never again to this place."}
{"text":"Me being picky on my road trip I love their selections. I bashed my head when they had the pig head...but I was a bit of a coward. I did have the lamb burger though and their bacon fat OH10 beans. Loved it. However the staff were not great and I had a really bad waitress who was pretty passive aggressive towards me."}
{"text":"My husband and I got a rare day to ourselves last Friday, so I made lunch reservations at one of our favorite downtown Cleveland restaurants...GHT. We were so excited, seeing as it's been almost a year since we've dined here. 

The two stars are for the phenomenal table we sat at. We were basically sitting right near the sidewalk and had a great view for people watching. The weather was fabulous that day, so we were in heaven!! Service was good as well. She forgot to put in our app, but we were in no rush, so no worries there. 

But...our entrees :( I am vegetarian and was excited to try the vegan Sloppy Joe. The side salad it came with was fresh and light...had some sort of mustard seed dressing on it. That was about the only thing I enjoyed (aside from my glass of wine). The sloppy Joe was lukewarm, and the bun was rather stale. It had decent flavoring, but definitely was underwhelmed. My husband had some sort of spicy chicken sandwich...which came with two little sharp bones inside :/ I ordered their seasonal cocktail, which was a vodka pineapple grenadine of sorts...and tasted very medicinal. 

I'm kind bummed but I'm hoping it was just an off day?? I'm not sure when we will dine here again :("}
{"text":"Our meal at The Greenhouse Tavern was outstanding!

The attention to detail in every aspect was incredible. The waiter was very knowledgeable about each and every dish, and was able to make recommendations based on his vast knowledge and experience. 

I would highly recommend giving this place a try the next time you're on E 4th"}
{"text":"Fabulous quality on point.  Unique and classical American flavors.  Short ribs was juicy and full of flavor.  Pigs ears tasted like crispy bacon.  Clams and charred bread in a most pungent salty foei gras sauce was over the top.

Saw table of guys chowing down on a whole pigs head! Wanted that badly but could convince my coworkers to adventure out of their norm.

Fabulous service by Elena and food to boot.  Come early as it gets mobbed by 7"}
{"text":"Sitting outside.  Great atmosphere.  Everything we ordered was absolutely amazing.   The Classic Benedict was just phenomenal.  Great brews and drinks.  Super friendly servers. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and proceeded to take advise from the bartender, it was genius!  he really knew the menu and knew the starters that complimented each other. Everything we had was great, but the wings were beyond outstanding!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. The complexity of flavors is a gastronomical event...it felt like a symphony in my mouth....one colorful note led to another. The pork chop, chicken wing confit, and foiegra  clams where amazing..."}
{"text":"I feel kind of torn regarding our experience here on Saturday 4/28. I loved the atmosphere and the decor, and having read other reviews criticizing how close the tables were to each other, this didn't impact on our evening. In fact, we were able to strike up a lovely conversation with a couple who sat next to us. 
Upon reviewing the menu, our eyes were immediately attracted to the tasting menu. Our waitress went on to explain that the 6 courses were down to the chefs discretion and would highlight the house specialities. $110 per person with wine pairings. SOLD. 

The first 3 courses came to our table within 10 mins, and we had to ask the waitress to slow things down.... thankfully they did. 
The food was fine. The ramp rigatoni dish was superb. It just felt that no real thought had been put into the tasting menu. The wine pairings didn't really match up with the dishes, and the dishes really didn't seem to highlight the restaurants 'famous' items. 

I would definitely give this restaurant another go, but unless some serious work is done to improve the tasting menu, would stick to the main menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a recommendation of a friend of his. We came here after a Cleveland Indians game. We got there around closing time and they had a light night menu. The service was nice and the food and beer were very good. It was a vibrant part of the city. I do not know if I would be coming back to Cleveland anytime soon but if I did I would come here again."}
{"text":"First we had the bread and butters (amazing and larger serving! We ended up bringing it home with us). Then I had the \"half\" side salad - which is very small and my husband had the burger, both very good. The poutin left a lot to be desired. The frites that came with the burger were wonderful. I will say the table next to is did get the pig head and I was 90% grossed out by considering you could see the teeth... Just not my thing! I would say the atmosphere was the best part (made us feel like we were back in Chicago)."}
{"text":"We were really excited to go here for food after rave reviews by one of my friends (who took us). There were 4 of us that went together.

First of all it took a very very long time to finally get our order taken. We had drinks orders taken delivered right away but had to wait another 10-15 minutes after that for our server Steven to take our food order.

We ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer. Three of the four of us love brussel sprouts so it was anxiously anticipated. When we finally started eating it we all 4 realized it was overly salty. Ok so maybe that's just how it's supposed to be. We didn't send it back because it was edible. Of course imagining it without the excessive salt I imagine it was delicious.

One of our party ordered the chicken wings and then three of us were in the mood for burgers. When the burgers and fries came out they looked great. Appetizing. Smelled wonderful. And then we bit in and again all three of us were surprised at the level of salt in the meals. The burger meat was tender but salty. Also I liked the grilled tomato or whatever type of tomato it was tasted great but salty. The burgers and fries were excellent we all just wish it wasn't so salty.

Then our friend with the chicken wings started eating her wings then asked for some fries and noticed that her wings and the fries were also overly salted. Salty to the point she really couldn't eat it any longer.


When she reluctantly asked the server for a new order of wings without the salt the server acted annoyed. He put in the order and didn't apologize or anything. At no point did any management come around and apologize for the food or offer any explanation. Finally it had taken so long for the wings that she ended up canceling her order. When we told the server again he acted annoyed and offered no apology for the delay just walked away and typed something into the computer. Just then someone showed up with the new order of wings. This order was much better and tasted fine.

What was sad that no one at any point made any apologies. All four of us agreed that there was excessive salt on the food and explained that to the waiter. Even after the delay no type of compensation, apology, or explanation was given. She was given her bill and paid the entire amount.

Needless to say our friend was disappointed she had recommended this place to us. We don't intend to return."}
{"text":"First off... i LOVE this place. I love the food, I love the wait staff, I love the bike wheel chandeliers, I Love it. To me, it's not a place that is meant for vegetarians (although I am not a vegetarian myself) since most everything that is unique and wonderful is cooked in, with or IS meat. I've eaten here for lunch before and the burgers and the wings are TOPS. 

Had a lovely dinner here on Saturday night. We ate outside this time starting with an appetizer of house made cheese and crispy toast that was mild and delicious. The lamb-shank ravioli appetizer was really very good - although the portion on that was teeny. 

For the main course, we had an amazing boneless ribeye with a red wine reduction and foix gras. YUM! Wow... amazing. The meat was flavorful beyond words and the portion was majestic. 

They have a grand drink menu, although they dont have any Rogue beers right now?!? But... I did get to enjoy a traditional martini made with Rogue Spice Gin. Very piney. Great to see a restaurant bring in something new."}
{"text":"Cleveland's restaurant scene is on a whole new level.  I would describe it as incredible, passionate and innovating.  Restaurants like this put Cleveland on the map. 

Community seating, from farm to table,  sustainable practices  Food that will move you.

anything on the Greenhouse Tavern Menu will nourish you physically, but also intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually too. 

the menu can be described as brilliant and environmentally responsible, and just plain innovative and wonderful.

It's silly but the one thing that still stands out for me is the warm crisp grilled Romaine Caesar.  everything we sampled was exciting. 

Our server was great, but the one who stood out was a gentleman that was a back side waiter.  This guy really needs to have more Responsibility then pouring water and clearing plates. He stood out the most.  Gosh I forget his name, Nice looking African American Gentleman.  His presence was very \"Charismatic\""}
{"text":"Had the Caesar salad and a lemon ginger growler. The smoky salad was swimming in capers (good) and drowning in dressing (bad). Not bad if you are a twenty something hipster (of which there were legion) but not really to my taste."}
{"text":"Anyone who give Greenhouse less than 5 stars is a dolt. 

Best Restaurant in Cleveland by a wide stretch, eat here if you haven't!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after a football game--being in enemy territory, we were nervous, but my friend that we were with had been here many times recommended the place. We sat at the bar and Erin took care of us-- she was amazing!! I got the house manhattan which was was of the best manhattans I've ever had, and my friend had the hot malted cider, which was also fantastic. I had the ohio beef burger, and my husband had the crispy chicken wings confits... Both were delicious! I would definitely drive from Pittsburgh just to eat at Green Tavern again!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food we've had in Cleveland. Also has a great beer list with harder to find options not typically available at most places in the city. Let your server help you decide and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a group of 15 girls going out and they let us make reservations down at the chefs table right by the kitchen. They were super accommodating to a huge group of semi drunk girls and let us play a few songs we wanted to hear down there. Bonus points for that!

The beer selection was decent. Service was great. The food was incredible. The wings were the best wings I've had in my life, ever. No sauce. Just perfectly seasoned and literally fell off the bone. I also ordered the poutine which was also very good but I was full from the wings. I can't wait to have more wings and try more of the menu. I want to take my husband back this weekend, that's how good it was. Everyone I was with really enjoyed their meal and it was the perfect spot to get all the girls together since they were so accommodating!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on Saturday night at 6 pm.  I'd made a reservation several weeks ahead of time on Open Table, and I was glad I did, as the place was already packed when we arrived.

We decided to try the chef's tasting menu, which now costs $54 but is still a great bargain.  For the first course, I had the devils on horseback, which I thought tasted amazing, and my husband had the carrots frites, which were pretty good.  For the second course, I had the chicken wings, which I really liked.  They came in a huge bowl; there must have been about 10 wings in there!  I had to stop eating them before I completely ran out of room, and that made me very sad.  My husband had the chicken fried chicken.  He got a thigh and a drumstick, which was about right portion-wise, and he thought it was very good.  For the third course, I had the pork chop.  I'd read many recent reviews that said this was a great dish, but I must have gotten a bad one.  One side was burnt black, and the cut was mostly fat and very little meat.  I guess I could have sent it back, but I was already so stuffed that I took it as a blessing that I didn't have much more meat to eat!  My husband had the properly butchered rib steak (which has a $10 upcharge when ordered as part of the tasting menu), and he thought it was phenomenal.  For dessert, I had the gold, frankencense and myrrh.  The description on the menu didn't make much sense to me, but I had the feeling it was a light dessert, which was what I wanted at that point.  The presentation was awesome, and it tasted really great as well.  It consisted of lemon ice with coconut milk and toasted rice.  I would have this dessert again in a heartbeat.  My husband had the buttered popcorn pot de creme, which he liked very much, but I found to be very rich.

Although they fell down a little on execution with my pork chop, everything else was so nice that I would be glad to visit this place again if we ever visit Cleveland in the future."}
{"text":"Came here on my visit to Cleveland and had some high expectations after reading about it on Yelp. The tavern is located in the middle of the gastropub area between E 3rd and E4th Streets. On the Friday night I was there, it was quite crowded in the area as you can imagine.

The restaurant is multi-floored so is very spacious. We ended up sitting on the 2nd floor, which overlooks the 1st floor via a balcony. The 2nd floor is actually small compared to the 1st floor, but just as noisy. We were pretty much starving when we got here, so cutting straight to the point we ordered the following for dinner:

Animal Style Frites - We ended up subbing the frites that came with our burgers with the animal style version instead of getting it as a separate order. According to many reviews this was a MUST and I second that now! If you have ever tried Poutine and love it, well this is basically the same concept. There's bacon bits, 2 fried eggs, mustard, mozzarella cheese curd and gravy layered on top of frites and all of that mixed together equals fried gravy frites goodness! 

Ohio Beef Burger - Burger was very juicy, cooked perfectly medium rare to my liking and the bread was unusually puffy and soft (not like your everyday sesame bun). The bread definitely stuck out because of its uniqueness. Look out for that if you get the Beef or Lamb Burger.

Pan Fried Pork Chop Saltimbocca - I had a chance to try a piece of this from a friend. The meat was tender and I loved the red eye gravy that was mixed in with it. They puree'd the mashed potatoes, which was not to my friend's liking, but to me it was a nice idea.

Another one of my friends ordered the Lamb Burger and he thoroughly devoured it, enjoying it in the process. Unfortunately, I never had a chance to try a piece as I busy with my Beef Burger.

Overall, Greenhouse Tavern had a typical gastropub atmosphere, but there were some kids there too. The lighting was dim and the crowd noise was high, but most importantly the food was really good!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here before going to an amazing Bruce Springsteen concert at the Quicken Loans arena close by. 
The chef is a former sous chef to Mike Symon and he Certainly learned his culinary skills from the master!
This restaurant on bustling 4th St. (2 doors away from Symon's flagship  restaurant Lola) is very cool, with very high ceilings and a variety of bicycles hanging on the walls and from the ceiling. 
As an homage to the Boss, they played nothing but his music that night which certainly didn't hurt!!
Service was excellent and attentive from start to finish. We had barely been seated when we received fresh bread and waters. Our waitress took our drink orders shortly thereafter. They have a good selection of craft beers and ciders to choose from. 
The menu is divided into courses, based on the size of the dish. We started with the dates wrapped in bacon - so addictive we had to order a second helping of these sweet and salty delights. The chicken wings were cooked perfectly crispy and arrived piled high in a large bowl. Don't miss these!
hubby and I both opted for the lamb burger, juicy deliciousness served on a fresh, fluffy bun. I opted to have  the stinky cheese topping on the side as I'm not a big fan. The fries served along with the lamb burger were equally amazing - crispy, crunchy and addictive.
The weakest point of the meal was dessert which was rather tiny - some kind of chocolate custard. By that point I was stuffed anyway.  
If we find ourselves in Cleveland again, we will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"GHT, as it turns out, is not only a carnivore's haven, but a veggie daydream as well.  Thick, crunchy, hearty, and of a rather disconcerting incarnadine hue (owing to a hint of beet juice!), the housemade veggie burger is a hit. Ditto the mustardy spiced kale salad. A semi-pricey lunch at $13 but definitely filling in a non gross-full way. Service is painstaking (40 min wait at the bar), but undeniably worth it."}
{"text":"Not the same tenderness, oilier than expected, sat at window, cornbread like shrimp.

First off, really good location in Cleveland. One of the most reviews places on Yelp so I decided to check it out. I was in town for work so I was coming in alone. They first sat me at the window by myself, which wasn't the worst. But then spots opened up at the bar and if it wasn't for me asking to go sit there instead, it seemed like they wouldn't have offered.

Ordered the short ribs which were two pretty good sized pieces. Both were a bit saltier than I liked, which justified me also ordering a side of fries. One rib was considerably more tender than the other, which wasn't too good for consistency. The cornbread it came with did not taste like any other cornbread I've had before, which wasn't a good thing. It weirdly tasted like shrimp, and no matter how much I tried to taste corn, I just couldn't.

From other reviews, it seems like this place was once good before. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing this time around but if I'm in the area again, I think I'll try other restaurants before coming back here."}
{"text":"Better late than never, right? I finally got to enjoy this spot after never even being told about it previously... I'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK! Let me give a play-by-play on my meal...

First there was the drink. Hand crafted tasty drink... It wasn't mine, but I drank it anyways. I shouldn't even be mentioning it anyways, because I can't even remember what it was called! Next there was the crispy chicken wings confit. What? Lin who hates chicken is eating chicken? I know strange, but I did! And I liked the flavors! It made the chicken bearable for me.  Really though, anything with jalapenos does that for me. Greenhouse was just the first place to ingeniously make me appreciate the combination. Yum. 

Then there was the entrees... Pan fried pork chop saltimbocca for the dinner date, hand ground beef filet of beef tartar for myself. The pork chop was tasty, but I am still dreaming about my beef tartar. My only thing is that I wish it came with more or bigger bread chips. The beef tartar also came with pommes frites, which we upgraded to animal style. I've never had anything poutine inspired, so I don't have much to judge this on. They were tasty enough, but I think I am more of a chili fries kind of girl. Oh well! Regardless Greenhouse tavern went above and beyond what I expected."}
{"text":"Overall very good! Great service and location. Interesting interior, small and cozy. We had 8:30 reservations were seated at 8, the restaurant was not crowded at all. Service was fast, the table was very small but cleared off to make room for the next round very efficiently. The food portions were extremely small but the main course was a great size. Everything was perfect, the only I did not like was the awkward gas station feel bathroom. Also when we called to see if their was any earlier reservation the lady was rude. Try the carrot tator tots and veggie burger."}
{"text":"Different menu. Have to take your time and study it. A lot of options and ingredients. Our waiter was awesome and rolled with the punches. I got a brunch special and almost like a vegetarian cornbeef hash. Interesting. Jerky starter was amazing. Really delicious. Homemade chips were like a more mild salt and vinegar. Burger got great reviews."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but that may be because I'm use to fast lifestyle. The chicken wings were awesome! However the strip steak, which a couple of us ordered med-rare came out well done, twice! Having to make a complaint to the manager was the only way this place semi recovered by comping our meals. It would have been one thing if they were $15 steaks, but $30 it should have been cooked correctly... The first time."}
{"text":"We've eaten here on several occasions, and considered it one of our favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, we had a very bad experience this time, and will probably not be returning in the future.  First, we were shoved into a tiny corner by the service area on the 2nd floor.  The waitress couldn't explain any of the dishes we inquired about. Our appetizer was presented with a prominent hair on it; the steak tartare was unseasoned and tasted horrible; the rabbit pasta was so salty it was inedible; the steak ordered to replace the pasta arrived medium well, even though it was ordered medium rare.  The slap in the face came at the end when they gave us a measly \"neighbor discount\" for all of our troubles, which barely covered the cost of one beer on our $200 tab for 3 people.  Sadly, this was supposed to be a birthday dinner for our son."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite places in Cleveland- Sawyer has definitely surpassed his onetime mentor and boss, Michael Symon, in creativity and freshness. While their forte is tasty, tasty animals, they do some really excellent vegetarian dishes. I'm still dreaming of the \"air cheese\" I had this weekend. The crispy hominy (with pork skin cracklins, naturally) explodes with flavors of citrus and the pickled onion. The wings are still one of the best things I've tasted, and the lamb burger wins awards for a reason.

We will be back to tackle the pig's head... if we can pass up the poutine for a change."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant/tavern on a cross-country road-trip that took me through Cleveland. This was a solid restaurant that would hold its own anywhere, including cities like LA and NYC. They serve sustainable, local food with only the freshest of ingredients. We ordered multiple small plates to split among four people including the chicken wings, asparagus, oysters, and pea fritters. The service was laid back but attentive, and the atmosphere beats most of the more commercial and fratty spots on the block. Would definitely recommend this restaurant wholeheartedly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dry.... Frozen..... Patty..... Sad!  The costumer service was excellent, the beer was fantastic, but the burger was like a patty from the the frozen section at a grocery store."}
{"text":"I came down here for one of Cleveland's recent Thursday Night Happy Hour special in the East 4th area.  I was only fortunate enough to eat their ridiculously (wonderfully) garlicy fries and a a few glasses of Sangria, but I really enjoyed the time that I spent here and would love to return to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Saturday night at 630pm 4 people(well 3 and a toddler)- no reservation -was told at the host stand that they had a table but we would need to be up by 830- no problem...take to out table on the 2nd floor.. Instantly greeted at out table and put in some drink orders. Then an order of animal fries... Let me tell you, they are a must... bacon and gravy and egg and fries it was a bit of heaven... We also ordered dinner(they have a kids menu with mac and cheese... the mac and cheese should be on the the adult menu) i got a pork chop that was very nicely done, my fiance got a steak that was cooked perfectly and our friend got tobasco chicken which had just the right amount of kick to be great and not over powering. Her daughter got the mac and cheese, very tasty but a bit over the top for a toddler who eats kraft mac and cheese... Everything was price reasonably for 4th street, a round of drinks, 4 meals and an app and we left under 150.. we will  be back.. Mainly to try the Flintstone pork chop which the table behind us got and looked amazing."}
{"text":"Really good grass fed burger. Nice, light bun with it. Before 7, there was a happy hour, which the burger was on. It came with amazing french fries that were seasoned with spices and garlic. I got a \"Coke\" (they didn't have Coca-Cola) which was actually a different type of soda. It was lesser in calories and a little more dry. Good place and great atmosphere. If you're around this restaurant, I wouldn't miss it!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice now and can honestly say I'm unimpressed.  First time I dinned here I had the steamed clams...I think there were three clams in all...give me a break.  The salad was unique with a nice chunk of cheese on the side, it was very good.  Then I had the cioppino which I thought was pathetic; overpriced and not much seafood at all.  Bread was very good.  They tend to take small plates to a new level with expensive price tags.  That was my first visit.

I tried them again last night and was a little happier with my selection but still felt the food was just average.  We ordered the chicken wings which were tasty and cooked just right but just overwhelmed with garlic.  I really never thought I'd say such a thing because I love garlic but this was overkill.  I then ordered the chicken which came highly recommended.  They bake the chicken in a dough.  Looked good but just wasn't thrilled with the chicken.  It was more stewed then baked.  I guess I just like that nice crisp skin as opposed to a slimy, fatty mess.  My friend ordered a burger and that looked great.

Overall,  the menu is unique and they do have some good food but they tend to be over priced.  I'll probably go elsewhere next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I got a dortmunder, no problem there. I got nachos, (chorizo & chicken) no good at all. Bland, very very bland."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Greenhouse Tavern.  After all, they rely on sustainable/local foods to make their dishes, and they are a \"green\" restaurant in every way from the food to the interior design.  But the general consensus was that the Greenhouse Tavern is actually the Salthouse Tavern.  We went here for happy hour and almost every dish we ordered for our group was so salty it made the food hard to eat.  French dip with au jus, gravy frites, fois gras clams... you name it, it was super salty.  The best dish had here for happy hour were the wings.  They were the only things that had the right amount of salt, perfectly cooked with fall-off-the-bone meat and perfectly crispy outer coating."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill on this lovely day so we decided to stop at greenhouse on E4th. Not my first visit here but felt I had to show an out of town friend what these crispy confit wings were about! Green house my be the only place that I enjoy there custom lager. Chill staff great location cool happy hour prices.lol I just understand the hanging bikes as decoration ? 4:stars"}
{"text":"I've actually had my eye on this place for a while and had even considered using the place for our wedding reception. The only issue was that the restaurant doesn't allow more than 50 people per floor which would be difficult for a large reception. The restaurant is 3 floors with bars on the ground floor and rooftop. The rooftop bar is pretty cool on a fri or sat night for people watching. 

Anyway, to the restaurant. It's located on the busy 4th St in downtown Cleveland. If you dine at the restaurant, easiest place to park is at the valet parking on 4th. You prepay whatever price and then the restaurant validates the ticket for you, bringing the price down to $8 so you'll get some money back. 

We made a reservation for 5(a must for fri or sat night) and were promptly seated at a table on the 2nd floor overlooking the promenade. We had heard amazing things about the pig face so we ordered that and the beef short ribs first as they take 45 min to prepare. To tide us over, we ordered 4 appetizers (cabbage salad, animal style fries, chicken wing confit and fried brussel sprouts). All of the food was really good and excellently prepared. The chicken wings and brussel sprouts were surprisingly on the sour side, a bit too much for my liking, but still excellently tasting. My favorite ended up being the brussel sprouts. The animal style fries covered in curds, gravy, bacon and a fried egg were really good too. Definitely something to try if you've never had poutine. 

The short ribs and pig face arrived promptly and wow was it a site to behold. Half a roasted pig face with some vegetables and bread. And then 5 lbs of beef short rib in all its glory. The pig face was tender with some crispy skin. The meat and fat just came right off of the face. If you're squeamish about meat with faces, then you should stay away. If you're a brave soul, definitely try it as it was amazing.

The short ribs were also really good, fall-off-the-bone meat with lovely roasted vegetables. It was really good although I've had similar flavors before so this wasn't too special to me. Just really well prepared. Ordering both may have been overkill for 5 people. Probably should have gone with just one and then ordered another appetizer. But having too much good food is a pretty good problem to have. 

I definitely need to come back for the Tabasco fried chicken, which looked amazing."}
{"text":"I had visited the Greenhouse a couple years ago with my wife but recently had a large group of my buddies from high school in town visiting so I brought them here for the evening.  
There were 8 of us, all adult males, all ready for dinner and drinks.  I had made a reservation the week earlier and was told we would be upstairs where they could accommodate such a large group of large, hard drinkin', voracious eaters.  We had a few drinks down the street before dinner and I stuck my head in about an hour before the reservation to confirm and was informed that we were \"good to go\".
Upon arrival I was informed that they had a \"proposition\" for us.  We would be seated downstairs in the kitchen.  \"Oh no!\"  I said sarcastically.  \"You mean we HAVE to sit at Chef's Table?!\" 
Needless to say we were all very excited to be in the middle of the action and our group of guys may have been as loud or possibly louder than the kitchen staff that night. 
We all ordered the tasting menu and several bottles of wine.  (Note - the house merlot is very good.)  We knew the pig face and the short rib were LARGE portions so for the 8 of us we only ordered two of each of those.  (Note: we left with two large bags of leftovers from the pig face and short ribs which I later turned into over 6 meals for my wife and myself.)
That night I had the fried chicken liver, followed by the foie gras steamed clams (transcendent), the hangover fries, and the pig face.  I even ordered the popcorn pot de creme with salted caramel for desert.  
We made sure to supply the cooks with a couple of \"Kitchen Coffees\" (aka post shift canned beers for the staff - actually something you can order off the menu for them to enjoy later to which they give you a bell to ring and the kitchen staff goes ape shit, banging pots and pans together, cheering and sending flames jetting from the grill top into the hood vent)
All my guests were thoroughly amazed, satiated, fulfilled and impressed.  One of them remarked that the dinner was \"Amazing fancy food without all the bullshit\"
Thank you Greenhouse Tavern.  You guys and gals are awesome."}
{"text":"I realize I'm going against the grain by not raving about this place, but 1, i don't eat meat so a lot of the good smelling stuff here isn't for me, and 2, while the rooftop bar is a great space that not everyone knows about, the bartenders up there, and downstairs, are SO SLOW it sorta ruins the whole experience. 

Of the drink specials, I preferred the rooftop ginger beer cooler to the others."}
{"text":"Greenhouse is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. While it has unique food, it is still a casual place to go for any meal including late night and brunch. The rooftop is a nice place to hang out or start your night, they serve their bucket of chicken on the rooftop only. The wings and animal style frites are a must."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat, drink and relax in all of Downtown Cleveland! Great staff and the food is outstanding.  Try their brunch Sat./Sun. And you wont be sorry.  If you are out at night and there is a Cavs, Indians, Browns, Ohio State....you get where I'm going with this, game on - go up to the rooftop bar - again great drinks and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Another Cleveland restaurant I've been dying to get to.....and it was worth the wait! Oh, that episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate when Michael Symon went out the Lola door, around the patios and into the Greenhouse Tavern door for the duck fat fries was what beckoned me in. The fries were everything I anticipated.....and more. Crispy, salty, garlicky and fragrant with rosemary...dipped in a heavenly aioli. The presentation alone was gorgeous (fries gorgeous? who knew?) with sprigs of rosemary and big hunks of garlic still in their papery skins artfully, yet casually scattered among and between the fries. Perfection. 

Then there was the lovely libation enjoyed along with those fries called the double chocolate Hey-sus (or something like that). Double chocolate 360 vodka, ginger and just a kiss of cranberry made for an unexpectedly refreshing WHAM of a chocolate sensation! I'd expected something sweet and cloying, but it was chocolate so that was just fine. Never did I expect a chocolate drink to be light and refreshing...and that was a very good thing! 

The bar staff was friendly and as we were there early, stayed to chat about good food and good drink. Great experience with outstanding service, food, surroundings and drinks. Yay Greenhouse Tavern!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great experience at this restaurant. We ordered Foie Gras Steamed Clams, Crispy Fried Padron Peppers, Goat Cheese Morel Raviolini, Crispy Chicken Wings Confit, Strip Steak Frites, and Pan Fried Pork Chop Saltimbocca. Every thing we ordered was awesome. In particular, the Pork entree utilized three different parts of the pig and was the most decadent pig meal I have ever had. 

For desert, we tried the Dobos Torte and the Johnnycake. 
We liked the johnnycake, but weren't thrilled with the Dobos Torte.

I need an excuse to go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best in downtown Cleveland. I've been a few times either for client lunches or get togethers with friends and it never disappoints. The lamb burger and the animal style fries are just a couple of things that really stood out and should definitely be ordered."}
{"text":"I used to live next door to the Greenhouse Tavern and it quickly became a HUGE favorite of mine.  I ate there almost every other day until I had exhausted the menu and became the Mayor on Foursquare.  

I have since moved to Chicago, but GHT remains the bar for what I consider an incredible restaurant.  Friendly staff (and owners, and his family), amazingly quick service, extremely knowledgable bartenders, unique, local, exquisitely executed food, all consistent, and all for a reasonable price!  Whether you want a quick burger on a saturday afternoon, or a really dressy evening out with clients or significant others, GHT is it!

From the best Pigface you'll ever have (ask Alton Brown!) to the wings, to the gravy frites (which are better than ANY poutine I've ever had in Montreal), to the drinks that no else knows how to make anymore, GHT continues to check every box I've ever had.

Thank you Jonathan Sawyer!"}
{"text":"Sooo I was that person who came here and was seated upstairs when I wanted a patio. I had the audacity to request a table change when it was like...packed. Totally didn't expect it to happen but the waitress, hostess and everyone was so friendly and nice to me about it. They made it happen! Thanks for making my birthday dinner special"}
{"text":"Cute somewhat pretentious bar with so so service which is not really acceptable since the beer is incredibly overpriced. I was visiting from New York for beer week with my husband who is a craft beer enthusiast and works for a brew pub in the Uk. We found the greenhouse very overpriced certainly compared to other establishments in the area for the same beers without having superiorly clean lines (cleveland loves beer, and good quality beer is easily found) its even overpriced compared to some places that do the same crafts in NYC. We did not try the food but the people around us seemed unimpressed. If they want to continue charging top dollar they should  consider restaffing or just getting rid of half of the snotty girls who were just standing around doing nothing anyway."}
{"text":"OK  I will be extremely fair, I will not give 1 star nor 5,   The server was a rad girl, wearing jeans and a black t-shirt a little edgy and tough but we got along fine, the drinks were solid $ 5- $8 for a beer, she offered a beer that had 10% liquor very nice on her part hands down !  Helpful waiters and helpers that walked me to the bathroom , now the food:  The Pom Frittes was real good as the chicken wings were delicious mixed in with some nutty spicey greens and garlic,  the chicken  entree was real good and excellent but for $ 36 - $ 38 too steep, the surf and turf was a cheap beef paired with a very good tasting scallop and small potato and a 3 tiny pieces of sausage,  I would recommend a french fry dish, wings or a soup or something if you are vegan, overall was a lot of fun, a different atmosphere that was cool and different, but watch the entrees, small portion size, go with 2 appetizers, a friend that went with us has been there before and ordered 2 appetizers instead of an entree,  he was now a pro and a smart one , got 2 X more food than I did ,    Not to forget the desert was real good but the ice cream amount was a joke maybe 1/4 quarter of an ounce of Jenny's Ice Cream from Columbus  ,  pass on it,"}
{"text":"Had the corn beef hash on the brunch menu, very delicious and  a good amount of food for $11 price. However, the drinks are ridiculously overpriced, I paid $7 for their greenhouse tavern lager, which was nothing special. Overall, a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Drinks were delicious and well crafted. Portions for the price were too high. I don't mind paying more for good, local, well made food, but I don't expect to be starving after spending $70 on food for 2 people and 3 drinks. 

My omelet was salty and that was it's only flavor profile. It tasted like I licked a salt block. The cup of soup looked sad in it's mostly empty crock pot. Almost everything had pork in or on it.

The staff was great, service was wonderful and everything was cooked well (except the omelet), but just not worth it unless you are a wing/pork kind of person.

My partner and I went across the street and ate a second lite meal at Corner Alley because we were still hungry after GHT."}
{"text":"Overall I would say our experience was just so-so.... Went with a large group for dinner and had quite a few different appetizers, dishes and desserts. The bacon wrapped dates with chocolate seemed more like a dessert, but the carrot frites and gravy frites were great. Whatever you do, don't try the Kale salad! The lemon and smoky tastes were way too over powering I barely ate any of it. Everyone who ordered pasta was happy, but everyone else not impressed. If you want to get dessert, go for the buttered popcorn creme, it's the best one!"}
{"text":"Four of us had a great time at the Greenhouse Tavern. We tried three of their first/second courses and thoroughly enjoyed them. The steak and frittes were excellent, as to be expected. One member of our party ordered the ruby trout - which came to the table seared rare. It was unexepected (the waiter didn't tell us) and b/c of a health issue had to be sent back. Cooked through, it was still very well prepared and tasted wonderful with Farmer Jones' veggies. Desserts were also tastey but not the best out there - apples with Jeni's icecream and a chocolate bread pudding. 

Would recommend this for the adventurous eaters out there - though there was plenty to pick from if you aren't an adventurous eater."}
{"text":"A group of 9 of us made reservations last minute on a Friday night and they accommodated us. We sat upstairs which overlooked the entire bar. Look at the menu before you venture here. Lots of pork/steak. The chicken wings are a must have. They are well flavored and fall right off the bone. Wait staff is great. Drinks mixed well. Service tip top."}
{"text":"I'm probably more a 3.5 on this one but opted for 4 rather than 3 because this place can easily be a 4 with the right order and service.
It's a great location and if you opt for the rooftop seating you have a terrific view of the city.
The prices are a bit steep for some items but fair for others--it really depends on the dish (e.g. the lamb burger obviously has $15 of quality ingredients to it but the chicken sandwich? Tasty but $10 would be closer to reasonable). Taste though--I opted for the lamb burger w/ \"stinky\" cheese and it was delicious. The fries come in a paper sleeve filled with garlic cloves and rosemary, perfectly crisp. My wife opted for the hot chicken sandwich which she loved as well. We split some savory roasted Brussels sprouts between the table and they were very nice.
I didn't opt for a lunchtime cocktail but there were some good looking ones on the menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely cannot speak highly enough for this restaurant. Incredibly polite, friendly, and hard working staff, a creative and delicious menu, and just a very warm, comfortable atmosphere. I've been when it was almost entirely empty and when there were no empty seats and there was absolutely no difference in service (our waters were never empty but we also never felt rushed or crowded). If I could give more than 5 stars, I absolutely would. Definitely make a reservation because it does get busy."}
{"text":"Very clean delicious food. Food to not weigh you down! It was very pricey for what we got!"}
{"text":"Hit up this place for some Afternoon Beer (the greatest pleasure on Earth, even moreso during the week) and some snacks before the Indians game. We were the only people there, and it was early, so we had a limited selection (Early Bird and Late Night menu) and didn't get an idea of what the scene is like. We split a couple of appetizers. First up was the confit wings. Yes, confit wings. This is a brilliant idea! The wings have a nice crispiness and are vaguely Asian-y. They are quite a treat. So good that I'll forgive the drop tile ceilings. We also had the gravy frites. Fries. Gravy. Cheese. I mean, you can't screw that combination up. Anyway, if I'm ever back for some more fun times in Cleveland, I'll definitely want to come back and try some actual meal food."}
{"text":"Owner and wife are awesome, always treated very well here. Hard to find friendly workers on east 4th and here is where to find them."}
{"text":"I'm officially done with wanting Greenhouse Tavern to be what I expect it to be, and i'm ready to face the reality; in a city teeming with incredible food options, GT isn't worth the time or the money.

I've been to GT a number of times, over the years. The beer scene is excellent, and the rooftop deck is supposed to be one of the best places to hang out and drink in Cleveland. The wings have been cited as being wonderful. That's the good.

The food is underwhelming AT BEST and features a menu chocked full of over priced offerings. 16-17$ tiny sandwiches and pasta dishes that leave you scratching your head. My date ordered gnocchi, and was delivered carbonara instead. The server checked with the kitchen, who informed us that \"They're generally the same thing, and can be substituted\"

Took three tries to get us a drink, the last time we came; we'd order, and the bartender would come back to tell us they were out. Half of the items on the menu were missing, due to a problem in the lines.

I refuse to waste another trip to GT when places like Mabels, Butcher and Brewer, Barrio, and Sushi 46(?) are within a shout of the front door."}
{"text":"100% horrible from start to finish. They lost our reservation. The hosts were rude. The place is an absolute pigsty! Rotten food all over the stairwell leading to the most cramped seating area on earth. The tables were 4 inches apart. We went to the bar instead and waited 10 minutes to be noticed while the bartenders & other staff slammed shots. The bartender was rude & had an attitude. The drinks are a ripoff ... small pours!
The food was horrible! Soggy fries, flavorless pig ears, a tiny portion of chewy skinned duck entree & a veggie burger that was tasteless mush... gross! Prices that came on the bill were more than the ones stated on the menu. $25 for parking & a 25 minute wait to get your car. Make sure you read all the not recommended reviews. Most of them are 1 stars & had a similar experience at Greenhouse. Team Sawyer needs to pay more attention to their restaurants and spend less time in Disney!"}
{"text":"Got the late night meal of wings and fries. The fries were luke warm and the wings were soggy. I have had these items before and they were both better. If I go back it would not be at night.

 There was a guy sitting next to me and he asked how my meal was I told him it was so-so. The bar tender seemed offended but I was being honest."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience at the Greenhouse Tavern- every single thing about the restaurant is flawless and wonderful! First, let's start with ambiance- the restaurant is very unique, warm, and welcoming. I enjoyed that it seemed to be sectioned off into pieces (two sections upstairs, and several downstairs as well). This made our dining experience more intimate and quieter than it could be if you were all crammed in one room.

Second, the food. We did the chef's tasting menu, which allows you many choices here, and absolutely loved every single dish. I really liked that my husband and I did not have to do the same tasting menu as it allowed us to sample more dishes. We had two separate firsts, seconds, thirds, and desserts and everything was perfect- presentation, temperature, portion size, fresh ingredients, etc. I also was very pleased to see gluten free, paleo (that's me), vegetarian, and vegan options- it is clear the head chef here knows there food and how to make it fit any diet restrictions. We also sampled several delicious cocktails including a Mezcal Margarita and Mulled Cider- both wonderful.

Third, the service. The waitstaff was great and offered excellent suggestions. We had many questions on the menu, and they were patient and knew how to explain each and every thing. When we travel we are always looking for the \"best\" restaurant in the city- and this must be one of Cleveland's best.

Overall, this restaurant makes me wish I lived in Cleveland- I would be back for sure!"}
{"text":"craving steak tartar

-for you Nicole.  thx.

Carry on."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend to try out their pulled barbecue mushroom sandwich which had won the award for the best vegetarian sandwich in America by Restaurant Hospitality Magazine. It was honestly one of the best vegetarian burgers I'd ever had- a burger with a savory and perfectly textured portion of shredded mushrooms- something I'd never had before-, BBQ sauce, mustard, coleslaw and lettuce. The best part was that it didn't feel like these guys were trying to imitate anything and just let their creativity and the ingredients do the work. 
Decent prices although portions could have been bigger, great burger, good service, definitely would recommend to someone trying to grab a meal in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant that offers you dishes that you can't pronounce or even understand what they really are but you know whatever you order will be mouth watering, then this is your place. I've been here four times and each time I order something different, also nice because they change their menu a good amount. 

My first time I went there I went with my now fiancé for my birthday. An appetizer dish that we got was a ramen dish with short ribs on it. We laughed and ordered it because we just got out of college and only at ramen while we were in so we had to get it. Holy crap. It was amazing. It even had a soft boiled egg on it and it was perfection. 

Then we went for new years and we did a 6 course dinner. I can't remember what I got or the names of it but I remember the taste, the flavors, and the smell like it was yesterday. The food comes in a little too large of portions but that allows you all to take tastes while at the table. 

It is definitely an expensive date if you need to go. Might want to save up a couple pay checks, but your mouth will be thankful. Also, a fun, different, unique atmosphere on the great E. 4 street in the heart of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Cocktails, service and food were very good.  I had the \"Not Your Father's Vodka Tonic\".  I could have sipped that all night."}
{"text":"I find the ground floor seating to be too crowded and prefer to sit on one of the elevated floors. Rooftop bar is fun when it's open."}
{"text":"The 4 stars are vindicated.  Nice place, but cabbage salad I had was wack.  Also only having 5 taps is a waste of this real estate."}
{"text":"I have been going to Greenhouse tavern now for over 5 years and have consistently received great service, food and overall experience. I have ordered something new every time I've been since the ever changing menu always has something interesting to try. But, there are a couple things I get every time I go, this includes the confit chicken wings and the pot de creme. The last time I was there in October, the wings, dessert and all the new items we chose were on point, including our seat in the very busy dining room on a Saturday evening where our waitress kept her cool the whole time and gave us super service. I went back last Friday, we had reservations for 7:15. We were walked through the dining room where there were several open seats and taken to what felt like the attic and was terribly cold and cramped the whole time. Our waitress was sweet and did her best to handle all the tables and small space up there, it only fit like maybe 6 tables. I asked to start with the chicken confit wings, they brought us two orders when we only asked for one, but I'm glad they did, bc my order was so spicy being cooked with way too much jalapeño, where as his order was much less spicy, but at that point our lips were burning so we could barely eat anymore. The second item we ordered was a vegan risotto, it wasn't bad but not my favorite. Then I ended with the pot de creme, which was watery with way too much salt. The whole experience was a huge let down after years of higher than average experiences. I will return, but it will be quite some time before I do and I will hope they can gain their consistency in their menu back before then."}
{"text":"Love a place that doesn't seem like it tries hard but yet the food and drinks come across as way over expectations. 

Greenhouse is a great place to try if you're in the area. The menu is creative but not overly eclectic. I had their take on potato salad as well as the fried chicken- neither disappointed at all. The potato salad was an interesting take with the potatoes being pickles. And I'm usually not a huge fried chicken fan, but this was done exceptionally, though the portion left a little to be desired (same with the potatoes). 

But highly recommend you give it a try if nothing else for some good drinks, unique atmosphere and a few interesting dishes."}
{"text":"Hate to say this was the worst experience I have had at a top-rated restaurant.  i called months in advance for a reservation for 10 to be sure we could get in.  Arrived  a bit early to be on hand to greet my guests and ordered a double gin.  It didn't come until well after all the 9 other guests had arrived and it came as some kind of martini when all I wanted was gin up.

Things went downhill from there.  We had intermittent attention from our one waiter.  We were there to have a good time and ordered some pricey wines. In spite of this, the dishes were interesting but in not very satisfying.  I post the photo fo the 12-dollar beet salad which has to be the highest price-of dish--to-price-of-ingredients-ratio of any plate on the planet.  The vaunted fried brussels sprouts were also way out of price-value line.

I Imagine that this restaurant was cool and trendy in its day, but it has started to take its customers for granted in service and food.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was beyond awful.  We were on time for our 11 a.m. reservation and we didn't leave until after 1 p.m.  We put in our order at roughly 11:30 and our food did not arrive for an hour, if not more.  Our server was not very attentive and when we did ask him about our food after 45+ minutes he said the kitchen was just behind, but he would go check.  Meanwhile, we saw multiple tables get their food before we did.  Once the food finally arrived, it was good, though we had to ask for maple syrup for our chicken and waffles and mamma cake.  Overall, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Great location, but many other restaurants I'd choose before coming back here.  Devils on horseback were yummy but incredibly small for the price.  Our lamb burgers desperately needed some greens and some textural variation.  The burgers were cooked nicely but we were disappointed.  And our server was terrible!  Forgot our drinks, barely checked back to see how our meal was, took a long time to bring our bill.  All-in-all, average at best."}
{"text":"Service is wondrously friendly.  Ironically, the vegetarian burger resembles raw hamburger...  and one time my bread was rock hard stale. But in spite of the unevenness, the food is really kind of delicious."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed is the best word I would use to describe my experience at Greenhouse. 

We came here on a Saturday night around 930-10 and were seated upstairs right away. I was with my brother and his fiancé who have dined at greenhouse a couple times and both had below average things to say about this place. I'm a big Jonathan Sawyer fan, and I was in visiting from Chicago so they agreed to giving it another shot with me. 

We have a fairly simple order as they were out of 50% of the menu. We ordered one of the wings, one of the fried fish, two orders of fried chicken and two burgers. 

Wings came out right away, and were fantastic. Followed by the fried chicken and the fish. One of the pieces of chicken one inedible because it was so tough and the fish wasn't anything to write on yelp about............

The dots are used to elaborate on the time in between us receiving our Apps and burgers. It was over an hour, and we saw them bring them to the wrong table next to us that hadn't ordered any food. The server was nice about it as she kept saying she didn't know what happened?? And she even asked us are you sure you haven't gotten the burgers yet?? As if we were lying to her. After over an hour she offered us a round of drinks on the house, which was nice but was too late and didn't seem genuine. When the burgers finally came out, they were undercooked and didn't impress at all. 

I was really disappointed in my experience here, I might give it another shot as it was the holidays and they were out of most of the menu.

The service was very weak and my brother said he experienced similar issues here before."}
{"text":"Over-conceptualized, over-salted, and overrated.  My date and I had a nice time together since the service was fast and friendly and peering over the rooftop ledge was fairly interesting.  But I won't be returning because everything about this place was just so misleading.  This restaurant kind of over-promises while under-delivering.  Let me explain. 

Concept food: where the ideas outsize the execution.  Greenhouse invents (and proudly RE-invents) dishes to create unusual tastes and textures.  As everyone reading this probably knows, do not be deceived: \"unusual\" does not necessarily equate with \"good.\"  Sometimes the ingredients paired for partner dancing instead broke out into a fist-fight. 

We had tiny duck confit cabbage rolls which were distinct but not delicious.  The spaetzle was a slippery mess of dough scraps so awash in butter that they ganged-up and refused to get on my fork.  The so-so veggie burger was dragged down by a pile of hard and skinny fries.  Plus every dish was salted to summon a herd of reindeer. 

Small plates: if you don't like it then, poo poo, you obviously just don't get it.  Meet your entree: an emperor who wears no clothes.  For the high prices at Greenhouse, the amount of food which they bring you is an embarrassment.  And yet the only one feeling embarrassed is YOU when you order 10 additional items just to stave off starvation.  Now, I know that we in the USA take bizarre pride in our very large portions of cheap food, but I don't know if Greenhouse's rush to create the extreme opposite is a solution, or just a problem of its own.  An un-filling and expensive problem. 

Ambiance: erratic.  The music throughout the evening skipped between genres while its volume enjoyed a steady climb.  Around 10:00 pm they cranked it for that good-ol' party feeling.  (The one where the noise suggest a room of 100 people, meanwhile 20 real people can't hear their conversations.)  The ceiling-full of antique bicycles is cool, but we never found the info page (or price list?) to accompany the very visible number cards posted at each bike.  Plus, a collection of VHS tapes and DVDs...for rent, sale, decoration? As mysterious as the recipes.

Rooftop patio: skeletal.  Just enjoy looking down on 4th street, because there's nothing really up there otherwise.  This would-be secret cove has a mess of bare tables and chairs better-suited for the destructive capacity of game-night crowds than for comfortable chilling with your sweetheart and friends.  Lastly, beware the final deception of all: the beers listed up there as \"Craft\" - those all come in bottles and cans only.  Every last one.  Silly you for assuming otherwise."}
{"text":"As someone unfamiliar with the Cleveland area, I was looking for a spot to visit while in town.  My Cleveland friends, knowing that I am somewhat of a foodie, pointed me in the direction of Greenhouse Tavern.  Not a mistake.

I came in directly after a baseball game and was a bit concerned that I was under dressed.  Although this place has a fancy menu, it is not pretentious in the slightest and I was good to go in my baseball attire.

We advised the waitress up front that we were in from out of town and were excited to sample the cuisine.  Started out with an order of the Gravy and Cheese Curd Pomme Frites.  OMG.  So fantabulous!  Our sweet waitress also brought us a complimentary order of a hominy appetizer, which is not something I would have ever ordered but I loved it.  It was almost flavored like ceviche.  Really yum and really nice of the waitress to give us a free item.

Onto the main dishes.  I ordered the Spring Pasta, which was amazing and my travel mate got the Pork Chop.  Both of these items were great.  We ended the night with the Popcorn Pot  de Creme, which was not a mistake.  It was creamy and delicious and just enough.

I had been told by many co-workers from Cleveland that CLE has a real food scene.  I was skeptical of this until my visit to Greenhouse Tavern.  My visit here made me excited to come back and try out some more Cleveland food establishments!"}
{"text":"Sooo we drove 16 hours because we were set on trying the pigs head. The server told us they only sell about 7 a night before they run out and that happens in the first hour. I wish they would have told us this when we made our reservation and inquired about the head. Although disappointing, we ended up getting the short rib and it was delicious! The service was great and the whole tavern was very neat and my only complaint is the music. Rap music during a cozy dinner kinda killed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to eat at Greenhouse Tavern, but from the delicious smells I'm guessing their food is pretty darn good. I stopped by on a beautiful summer night for a drink on the rooftop and this was definitely a cool spot. Great location on East 4th Street, good drinks, and good crowd. The also have outdoor seating out front that would be great for people watching."}
{"text":"2nd time at Greenhouse Tavern, same result, good times and great tasting food.  I was really struggling last Friday on where to go for a pregame drink / appetizer so I just chose Greenhouse because I though it would give us a good vibe to start off the night....and it did just that.  We walked in, no reservations, and received a decent table in the main floor area, past the bar.  This was about 6pm, place was just starting to fill up, but still quiet enough for everyone to converse.  

I decided to just go with the house red which turned out to be a very good choice.  My mind wasn't made up regarding dinner, but I was a little under the weather and thought that a nice red would jump start me without turning my stomach....good call JT.  The other two in my group just ordered a beer and water, respectively.  They do have a lot of different types of beers and a nice wine list but if you are going for a bud light, you might have to go else where.

As for food, we were heading out to dollar dog night at the Q so we decided to just get some snacks to share.  We went with the wings, clams,  frites, fromage blanc, and crudites.  I really enjoyed each and think it was a perfect grouping of snacks for a night out on the town.  I ate most of the Foie Gras infused clams but the wife ate most of the broth, it was a nice twist to the standard.  Clams were huge.  The Wings Confit were delicious as usual (my 2nd time getting them).  Make sure that you get all the cut up veggies on every bite, it really brings out a flavor explosion on your taste buds.  Although, I still like my sauce slathered wings, but not in a joint like this.  The other items were good but nothing I can really comment on.  I can only say that you can't go wrong with anything on this menu.  I really want to head back for dinner.

My only con for this place, which is probably because they were just starting dinner service, was that we had 3-4 different people asking us if we wanted our plates cleared when we were obviously still snacking.  This little annoyance can be ignored because I understand completely why it happened."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food! This was one of those times when I had stuffed myself at lunch and completely regretted it because I wish I had more room for Greenhouse Tavern. Just well executed food on charming, redeveloped East 4th St. (Right next to the Cleveland Hyatt).

I like how the ceilings are high and the decor is simple yet elegant. Service was courteous, informative and attentive - couldn't ask for more. I like it when service, ambiance, and food all go for the same vibe. 

The wings are really good. They look a little funny, but they are crispy and super flavorful. The roasted peppers and the corn soup were also top quality, and the peppers were super salty and spicy (in a good way). The bottle of Argentinian Malbec we had was excellent, and not too pricey (about $8/glass). I was so stuffed I had to take half of the wings home, but I had no refrigerator in my hotel room! I ended up just eating them a few hours later anyway since they were so delicious!

4.5 stars"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. First time was just for drinks, but the other day we met up with some people for appetizers and drinks before the Indians game. 

This place has a cool vibe going on. Love the menu and the rooftop bar area is awesome. We had the Crispy Chicken Wings Confit and the Animal Style Fries. Yum...both were amazing! The wings were very tasty and the Animal Style Fries were so gravy-licious!  They also have a very decent beer and wine menu. 

The one problem I have with this place is the hipster-snootiness I have encountered on both occasions. One in our party asked the server 'what does confit mean again?' And he totally gave the wrong answer. Yet he was visibly annoyed that I ordered a Dortmunder instead of one of their brews. I was planning on trying their beers maybe with the 2nd or 3rd round, but at the moment I just wanted a Dortmunder, OK? It annoys me when places try to be all hip and unpretentious (for example, they have Shlitz in the can on their beer list) but then really they are all snobby about stuff. 

Look, just because I'm wearing a Tribe jersey and not some D&G, don't mean I'm a bumpkin. Plus I know what 'confit' means and you don't. Punk. Hence, no 5 stars for you. 

But do go check this place out. It's a cool addition to downtown for sure. Go and try the Animal Style Fries and sit on the rooftop on a nice day - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"disappointing is the first word that comes to mind when i think of greenhouse tavern. I'm sorry but this place sucks. i have been here on two occasions. 

1) a girlfriend and i had dinner on a friday night around 8 o'clock. we sat on the first floor near the bathrooms. i will start by saying i'm not a fan of the decor whatsoever. our waiter, whose name i cannot remember, was incredibly friendly, nice and patient. since my friend and i hadn't seen each other in awhile, it took some time for us to finally get around to looking at the menu. i have only heard good things about the wings so we ordered those. they were indeed very tender however extremely salty. we ended up not ordering entrees but instead two small appetizers. i cannot remember the names of them but i had a spiralized salad and she had something that she thought would be pork and ended up being pork rinds. we both did not enjoy either of these. 

i cannot say nicer things about this waiter. he was extremely accommodating to my severe food allergy and insisted that they would make anything they could for me. here's where my second experience comes into play. 

2) i took my fiancé here last night. we both recently moved to cleveland from NYC, where he is from. although my last experience with the food here left little to be desired, we are huge fans of top chef and Mabel's next door and i wanted to give GH a second chance since he was after all Michael Symons executive chef. what a gigantic mistake. 

we were seated upstairs in the corner against the balcony. i am 5' 110 lbs and i literally could not get into the chair because there was no room. this table shouldn't even exist. i ordered a cab sauv ($10) and my fiancé had a glenmorangie ($12). he was appalled at some of the up-pricing they do here with some of the scotches (blue label $48) and even mentioned that it's higher than some places in NYC.  the drinks took about 10 minutes, during this time i noticed our side plates were filthy. 

our waitress was tall and thin with dirty blondeish hair and wore a lot makeup. i say this because i do not remember her name because she didn't introduce herself (not very professional). i proceeded to order the chicken wings, then asked what the market fish was to which i was met with \"its red snapper, but do you like curry\"? i'm like ? indian or caribbean? she basically just told me this dish was not good. okay, i move onto another dish, here is where i get around to telling her about my food allergy to milk and eggs. to make a long story short, she told me i could get a veggie burger (no thanks) or a side salad, fries and Brussel sprouts... because i got up and got dressed to go out to dinner to have fries and salad after all. i asked her about the steak and she said can you have butter? what is the main ingredient in butter, lady? she told me i could get a plain steak alone because it comes with mashed potatoes. this waitress didn't accommodate me whatsoever, and several times left the table and said \"i'll give you a few more minutes!\". 

eventually we made the decision to leave, which the waitress couldn't have cared less about and gladly gave us our bill and walked away. id like to mention the hostesses who had the maturity level of 8th graders also, who said goodbye to us without even looking up from their cell phones. 

all in all, i will absolutely never be back here. we walked to urban farmer in a blizzard after this disaster and ended up having one of the best meals i've ever had in cleveland. i am so disappointed in this place, maybe it isn't chef sawyers fault but i would highly advise the manager to educate your staff and take the time to find quality people to represent your establishment. i expected a little more from someone with a james beard award.

edit: another off putting thing to note, clearly whoever manages this establishment either doesn't read yelp (bad idea) or actually just doesn't care about dissatisfied customers. you can see that they have never once given a response to any unhappy patrons. not a good look."}
{"text":"This restaurant and Lola are my two favorite paces to eat in Cleveland.  Fresh food with emphasis on locally grown helps this pace stand out.  Best service I have had on multiple visits for any restaurant in the city. Anything involving cheese s terrific."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday night (1/2/11).  It was among the few places that was actually open at 8:30pm.

Drinks: they had a $17 Manhattan that they had aged in some casks.  It was easily one of the worst Manhattans that I'd ever had.  It tasted like cherry juice.

Pommes Frites: not nearly crispy enough, and overly greasy.

Chicken Wings with ghost chili sauce: not all that spicy.  As far as chicken wings go, they were acceptable.

Spicy white beans and greens (don't remember which -- maybe mescaline): the best thing we ordered.  The flavour from the beans and greens came out, and the spice level on them was good but not overwhelming.

Poached artichoke enpapier: completely flavourless, and there was barely any artichoke in it.  I believe it had some barley and potato as well.  It was exceptionally monochromatic.  Adding some herbs (a bit of rosemary, maybe thyme) would have done wonders.  As it was, the veggies were overcooked.

Chocolate bread pudding: not soft enough, and the chocolate sauce was incredibly sweet.

Overall, the ambiance was ok, but the overall meal was about twice as expensive as it should have been.  I would not go back unless it's the only thing around that's open."}
{"text":"Greenhouse is one of my boyfriends favorite restaurants in Cleveland, so he convinced me to go with 4 stars. He loves to order the pig head with big groups, as it's very unique to this place. We took my parents for lunch, and enjoyed our sandwiches. Making a reservation was easy, and the staff was friendly. However, I am not a big fan of their decor, they have bikes hanging from the walls and the place doesn't look that clean, but then they charge $$ for their menu items which I think is overpriced for the portion and quality of food. We went for a birthday celebration, and had one waiter in a polo serving us, and a waiter in ripped jeans serving the table next to us.. its just confusing as to what they are trying to be! We sat in the balcony upstairs, and their stairway could use some renovations as it was pretty run down looking. The food is decent, but I just don't get the hype."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible!!! We four people went in on 5pm on Monday night (a Cav's game night), asking for a table of four. The girl said the tables are all booked except a window small side table, which is tiny and not comfortable for four people. Since we didn't want to go back to the freezing weather, we settled there and ordered drinks and food.

Our waiter is a rude bold snob guy (sorry for my disrupting description). He kept rushing us order more food while we are still eating the ones on the table. When I finally couldn't tolerate that he came to interrupt our table so frequently, I asked why looks like you are in a hurry. He said because the table is reserved for 6'o clock. I was SHOCKED. I asked their manager again if the table is reserved and the manager said no, so we stayed there still enjoying our drinks and food.

Then the waiter came again!!! Brought the check and insisted us to pay and leave. SHOCKED!!! THE VERY FIRST TIME BEING FORCED OUT A RESTAURANT!!!

I don't know if we look like not being able to pay the bill or if that was just RACISM?!!! Yes, we  are not American, but that doesn't mean we can be MISTREATED!!!"}
{"text":"I would've given it 4 stars for the food but the staff, our waiter, threw it waaay over to 5 stars.

Ok, so in Cleveland on business and met with a Clevelandinite friend. Was going to go to Lola's but didn't have reservations so we went to Greenhouse which my friend preferred to Lola's anyway. Was excited to as I wanted to try Iron Chef Michael Symon's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate' recommendation of gravy frites.

We started with devils on horseback which was really good. Then I saw that they offered a tasting menu for $44 which included one from each section plus dessert. I'm a big fan of tasting menus so both of us ordered that. Then came the piece de resistance: foie gras steamed clams and the beef tartar. The clams were to die for!! Do not leave this restaurant without ordering the clams. Heard you can have it as a second course which I will be sure to do next time. The beef tartar presentation was a work of art and the flavor superb with its triad of sauces and poached egg with the tartar AND fries to boot. It's a meal in itself.

Then based in the Yelp reviews, we ordered the crispy chicken wings confit. They were tasty but wasn't mind blowing like the previous dishes. It wasn't crispy either but the scallion, lemon juice and garlic concoction was delicious. The fabulous part was when we were asked how we liked the wings and we weren't thrilled, he promptly and insisted that we get something else. We then took his recommendation and got the goat cheese morel raviolini which was creamy and great. Then my friend got the lamb burger and I went for the $30 upcharge and ordered the 40 day dry-aged rib steak. OMG, it was the biggest entree plate I had ever seen. It comes with the marrow which was fabulous. However, warning; it is VERY, VERY, salty!! I thought it was just me but when I mentioned it to the waiter, he did acknowledge that they do get complaints due to the salt but that is how they age it. So I cut around the outside and it was fabulous! A bit extra work but it was so darn good, especially with the bordelaise and parsley salad, it was a match made in heaven. And we then substituted a dessert for the gravy frites that Iron Chef Symon recommended. That was such a disappointment!! Shame on Chef Symon. :( When it came out, I realized it was poutine which I'm not a big fan of. It was salty and soggy (of course). I much preferred the regular pomme frites that came with the beef tartar and the steak frites that came with the steak. All their frites are fried in duck fat and flavored with rosemary and are delicious.

For dessert we got the stoner sandwich which was very nice though I am not a huge fan of mint.

Back to the 5 star rating. My friend was in a great mood and we kind of imposed our food recommendation on this guy sitting next to us. We told him not to order the wings and lo and behold he got a plate of wings. We commented on that and he said he actually ordered the liver so we told him he should say something and he said it was alright. So we promptly called the waiter over and told him about the mistake and shoot the guy said it was alright but again our waiter insisted on getting him the correct order and told him he could have the wings as well. That was so great of the waiter!! Kudos for the service.

And when he ordered dessert we kind of made suggestions and he ordered the 7 layer cake dobos torte. He tried ours and we tried his and the bottom line is the desserts didn't blow us away. It was a bit of a let down but the majority of the food and the service were so superb, so on that note, I highly recommend this restaurant!! It is definitely a must in this city.

P.S. My friend took my left over steak and our 'friend's' wings as well and mentioned that it was even better the next day."}
{"text":"The waiter was very nice, though ...
the gnocchi was very skimpy in portion size, with about five or six pieces in the large bowl.  It came with olives nicoise, and there were only about three very, very small olives and one olive pit!  (Was the waiter trying to help me diet?)  It was very greasy and heavy, too.  Don't order the gnocchi.
The aged steak someone else ordered was almost too fatty to eat, and the guy had a very hard time picking through with his fork to find edible pieces.  And he is not picky usually about fatty steaks, but this was almost not edible.  The fries that came with it were fried in duck fat and had an unusual taste and most of the fries went back on the plate, and we never, ever leave fries on a plate.  They were not very good.  They were heavy and funny.  
The arugula salad was not, in fact, arugula but some other lighter garden green.  Not arugula.  The dressing was amazing, though.  In fairness, I didn't complain due to the company at the table, but the waiter didn't say anything either.  I saw another person receive an arugula salad while I was there, and what she got was, in fact, arugula.
How do they justify that?  Shame.
I was impressed that it was locally grown and organic faire, but it was very, very expensive, and I wouldn't go back in any event."}
{"text":"I have had two bad meals here now. I'm not going back. I know. I know...The James Beard Award is impressive but there is a disconnect now. I ordered the burger-medium rare the first time. I just found their menu to be difficult for someone who eats low carb. So I discarded the bun and fries. The meat was charred on the outside- in a bad way- no flavor and hard. I ate 1/3 of it. So I basically paid $18 for 2oz (if that) of hamburger meat. The worst part is they didn't ask me if my meal was to my liking or offer alternatives. How can they take back a full plate of food and not ask?
Second time had the bistro steak. I asked for no potatoes and no capers. I said, \"If the chef has anything green to sub for the starch, that would be great.\" I got about 8 oz of sliced GRIZZLE on a plate for $25. Seriously folks- had to spit out a wad of grizzle at the end of EVERY bite. When the waitress started to clear my napkin, I had to explain to her the napkin situation so she didn't spill its contents. I explained  how it was the toughest piece of meat I had EVER had. She didn't apologize, ask questions, or send anyone else over. In addition, I ordered the charred brocollini to share with my friend. She specifically asked about the ingredients in the topping and was there any meat in the anywhere. She asked twice and clearly. The waiter said no and then a piece of bacon comes out on top and she (as a vegetarian) accidentally takes a bite. When we called the waiter over, his answer was \"I guess they changed the recipe.\" No offer it replace it or refund it and NO APOLOGY. So bad service. Worse food. Bad review."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a few coworkers. The service was wonderful; very capable, but also unobtrusive, which is rare. Our table received complimentary crispy chicken wings that fell off the bone and had a unique flavor. Being from South Louisiana, I was thrilled to see a muffuletta on the menu (a New Orleans specialty). I gave it a try, but did not care for it. It was non traditional--the meat too fatty and the bread soggy. The fries are good for a shared appetizer, but the flavors are too intense to eat many on your own. Overall, some of the food seems over-seasoned and just overdone. Let the flavors of the core ingredients shine a bit more..."}
{"text":"Fabulous small plates! The Brussel sprouts and chicken wings fried in duck fat are amazing. We sat at the Chefs Table and our experience was great! Top notch service!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation booked for my anniversary. While on the way the there my wife wanted to know if there were more vegetarian options than the limited items listed on the menu. She called and the hostess answered, my wife asked what, if any are your vegetarian alternatives on or off the menu? The hostess simply said, \"just go to the website, it's all on the website.\" Needless to say we didn't keep our reservation."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this bar? It's a little pretentious, yes, but everything on the end is worth ordering. If I can make a recommendation: order the animal frites. I don't care how hungry you are, or what time of day it is. It's time you experienced the big kids meal. Order. The. Frites."}
{"text":"In the past 5 years, I can say that I have been to this establishment 50+ times at least and the service is typically wonderful and knowledgeable 9 times out of 10. The food continually changes based upon seasonality of the products available locally and the beer and cocktails are whimsical and are paired well with the food. Can't say enough great things about the staff and the chefs that have risen from the kitchen have gone on to do amazing things. Wu Tang Forever"}
{"text":"Well.  Apparently it's not a secret that this place is awesome.  But, it is...awesome.  Great, unique fare, bursting with flavor.  Cool style inside the restaurant/bar as well as outdoor seating on fun E.4th.  Also, great adult beverage concoctions and great, helpful, very friendly staff behind the bar.  I'm so glad that places like this are popping up and doing well in MY Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is strictly a review of the rooftop bar. There were 3 bartenders and only one was hustling her little butt off. The guy was so slow and couldn't make more than one drink at a time. We almost left because we couldn't get service. It is a very pretty rooftop and lots of seating. Hit several bars on east 4th in the same night and this was the only one we had bad service at. It was also the first we went to. Would have stayed and hung out but who wants to wait forever to get a drink. I personally wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"**Happy hour review**

I've been a fan of GHT for a long time but just recently got to take advantage of their happy hour. Inexpensive drafts and $5 wine pours are what you'll find here. The food and drink deals aren't as good as most other restaurants around, but GHT has such a great atmosphere that it doesn't matter. 

We went with the chicken wings and the fries. Both were outstanding and a perfect portion. I may even say best  chicken wings ever? Check this place out if you're itching for an upscale happy hour.

I' also plan to head back to finally try the infamous pig head."}
{"text":"Great menu, local farm fare presented in a creative way. Food and service were outstanding.

We shared Devils on Horseback (figs wrapped in bacon, flavorful with a great sauce), Asparagus wrapped in Ramps (fresh and tasty), and Gravy Frites (fries with peppery gravy and cheese curds). Gravy Frites was a meal itself and a great tavern food. Entrees of Arugula Salad (very good, nice dressing) and the RIsotto (goat cheese, ramps, and poached egg). RIsotto was the highlight of the evening."}
{"text":"Shared corn bones, jalapeño chicken wings, and pomme frites with rosemary & garlic with my friend who was in town from Seattle.  I highly recommend all 3 dishes we ordered!  The atmosphere is eclectic, and our server was very kind and explained the menu to us."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite restaurant. Everything....and I mean EVERYTHING is incredible. I have never had a single bad dish here. Just go...stop reading and go! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Just came in from LA and wanted to try this restaurant that was featured on travel channel. Had the clams, bacon wrapped dates and chicken wings that were recommended by the bar tender. I must have had a bad serving, but the chicken wings were as dry and tough as beef jerky, bacon wrapped dates were nothing special, bacon was soggy. The clam broth was good but the clams were over cooked.  Service was good. Being from LA, maybe I was expecting too much."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great for the price.  Dinner for two people (shared entree & we each had 1 beer) the bill was over $100.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Not pushy.

I appreciate that they did not try and rush is through our meal.

Pee Wee Herman movie was on the bar tv. That's just bizarre to me.  It doesn't impact our dining experience whatsoever but it does result in an odd bad experience.  Also - the music that was playing in the restaurant during dinner time was rap music and they said the \"N word\" ... Perhaps that music selection should be reserved for after dinner time ... Especially on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Where to begin... The pig's head?  Amazing, so tasty and unique (and slightly creepy, in a fun way).  The atmosphere?  So funky and fun- rooftop is perfect for a drink (they don't serve food, up there, but the Dark n' Stormys are on point).  Steamed Clams? SO yummy- the sauce was to die for.  This place is also great for you vegan and non-meat eaters- lots of options.  The only thing I haven't been 100% pleased with is the service can be a bit on the slow side, and skip the eggplant- its boring.  Other than that- a really solid choice when downtown."}
{"text":"The food here is mostly very weird. The restaurant actually smelled like blood (not kidding). And nobody in our party of 6 felt right after eating there....varying levels of food poisoning with the common denominator being the chicken bucket. The popcorn pot de creme was good but $8 for probably an ounce. Overall, very overpriced and the food is weird/induced stomach problems. This was my second time there and the first was not impressive either. Would not return."}
{"text":"I waited forever. $10 glass of wine. I hate places that give you crumbs and charge premium prices. The portions were so small. My poke was literally the size of a large coin."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Always one of my favorite spots in CLE but hadn't tried the brunch until yesterday. Great service as usual, presentation very nice, and taste excellent. We started with cocktails of course and the kale salad. Everything very thinly sliced with a light mustard base dressing. Nothing overpowering but delicious. Things got more serious when my steak and eggs arrived. Perfectly cooked and a very nice savory gravy to go with home fries and toast. My wife had the chicken sandwich. Breaded chicken on brioche with chips is a lot of starch. After seeing the chicken and waffles she had a bit of buyer's remorse, but overall great meal, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and Renee took such great care of us!   Pork entre was amazing -walleye was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Sometimes we approach restaurants that we've seen on TV in a different way - usually with higher expectations, and definitely with pre-conceived orders and menu judgments. I've actually just recently read a few Dan Ariely experiment write-ups about perceptual fluency effects of liking something, and whether/when we're given external validation about the quality of food.
We had heard about Greenhouse from a few sources - Michael Symon on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\", where he talks about sneaking out of his neighboring restaurant to order their gravy fries; from a coworker of mine whose opinion I trust; and in comparison with a few of our local favorite farm-to-table places.
This experience did contrast with a few of the other Cleveland stops we had, also mentioned on Food Network, but not as outstanding. Greenhouse Tavern, however, was as good as promised.
We grabbed a few seats at the bar and ordered quickly because we were warned that they were closing within a few minutes. No problem, we knew exactly what we wanted and there were a few other people who'd just sat down in the post-baseball-game rush.

To share:
Fries with gravy and mozzarella curds
Cilantro lime jalapeno wings

These wings were unique in a few ways, but the main thing we want to highlight is that the flavors were perfectly balanced. This is a combination that we've tried ordering at other restaurants since, when spotting it on a menu, but it's always soapy (way too much cilantro) or bitter. At Greenhouse, they're just delicious. Spicy but not painful, bright but not too acidic, and just so fresh. They're very tender, and that has a lot to do with the cooking method - confit and then fried.

The fries are delicious - though messy, and a huge portion. It's a great gravy, not overwhelming and definitely not broken.

We'd be back in a minute if we were closer, and we would've visited it a second time if their hours were longer (closed mid-afternoon, and closed a little earlier at night than worked into our schedule)."}
{"text":"Food: amazing. Service: impeccable. Ambience: perfect. Price: worth it. Such a great dinner. Kevin treated us so well, and even remembered our names. Will definitely come back when we come to Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Very stuffy. Should not be called a Tavern. Everyone was nice but the food was WAY OVER PRICED. If you like stuffy uptight places then it would be great. They are very green, bathrooms were very nice and the inside of the \"Tavern\" was nice."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was good but food was lacking. I'm guessing the lamb burger patty had been frozen but I admit I didn't ask. The salmon poke was pretty good but was a really small portion, even for a app. Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I don't like pork chops, but the waiter talked me into them and they were amazing! Great beer selection too. It's a must if your in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great little place that we found quite by accident.  We came during the early bird hours for mid-afternoon snack (too late for lunch, to early for dinner).  Service was super attentive and gave great suggestions for beers - the selection was pretty good too.  We went with the frites and the wings - both were amazing.  

We tried to go back after the baseball game, but it was pretty crowded and the rooftop was closed for a private event.  Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This was so amazing. We had three courses and were still able to have dessert. We got the squash and apple for our first course and it was so good. We also had the wings and I am not a big spicy food person and I couldn't stop eating them. I would come back. The waiter was amazing and was able to take the time to talk with us but there still was not a long wait."}
{"text":"I was SO disappointed in my experience at the Greenhouse Tavern last night. We literally ordered exactly what the server (Kevin) suggested: heirloom tomato salad with feta (actually really good), wings (SO much citrus, like overwhelming lime flavor that made them uneatable) and the pork chop (came out UNDERcooked and rubbery with no flavor). The food was, honestly, terrible aside from our sad little tomato salad. We had to send everything back because we literally couldn't eat it. Kevin, our server, was obviously disappointed in the kitchen and food and tried very hard to make our experience better - remaking the wings and bringing us free dessert (it was a salted caramel pot de creme that was actually very good), but, I would NEVER recommend this place to a friend. Super unfortunate experience at a place that I had been looking forward to visiting while in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The prices are to high. The wait time for a $9 cup of soup was 35 minutes. The staff was helpful after I told them the price was high by telling me that is the price for the location. So if you are looking for a good location where the food is really small and the price is high then go here. The wait is part of the charm of the high prices small amount of food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided to take us for brunch here on a nice Sunday afternoon for our 2 year anniversary. We've never been here for dinner but my god was their brunch the best I have ever had in my life. If we lived closer to downtown or didn't have to pay for parking as much this would probably be our new go to spot. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which don't look like much at first, but they were amazing. My boyfriend got the full size animal style hash which was enough to feed almost 2 people. He loved and so did I. Server was cool and attentive. Loved the hip hop playing in the back round and the place was interesting and trendy. Will definitely be back for brunch and hopefully sometime dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband and I went here for our 5 year anniversary last night! The very best thing we ordered were the chicken wings confit. The wings were smoked and then fried and had such delicious flavor! They had lime juice and jalapeños which were not overpowering and very balanced. My husband ordered a burger and fries and thought it was very good. I ordered the park chops because that's what the server suggested to me. I thought it was very flavorful but half of the meat had fat all over it and half was chewy and looked undercooked but wasn't. The part that was chewy was also wrapped in prosciutto. We also ordered the butter popcorn pot de creme for dessert and it was the smallest dessert I've ever gotten for $9, but still very tasty. Overall this place was great though. The service was absolutely fantastic! I will definitely go back for wings next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Love The Greenhouse Tavern!!!  Food, drinks service is exceptional!!! I have had the confit wings, and they are amazing!  Also had poutine, and a burger, and it was beyond perfect.  The first time wee went there years ago we had the pommes frites, that they fry in duck fat!   what could be wrong with that.  Please give them a try if you want something fun and different in Cleveland."}
{"text":"OK, I've been trying to not be so generous with handing out 5-star ratings, but the Greenhouse deserves it. This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland, and I've been putting off writing a review for so long because I struggle to find the words. I may also be lazy and slightly dramatic.

Anyway, don't go to the Greenhouse if you are a picky eater or don't want to spend a little extra on a unique meal. If you're a vegetarian, there are options for you, but you're going to see someone at the table next to you order a pig's face or giant beef shin. Brace yourself. 

The menu changes monthly, and I love checking online to see what creations they are offering. But the one thing I will never stop ordering is the chicken wings. Cooked in duck confit and covered with an amazing relish consisting of jalapenos, scallions and garlic with a dash of lemon, these wings may not appeal to everyone on paper, but the flavor is like no other chicken wing I've ever had. An added bonus - the wings are on the late-night menu (after 10pm, I think) at a reduced price, so stop by after a Cavs or Indians game. 

I've been to the Greenhouse so many times that I won't comment on everything I've eaten. But my favorite entree is the Chicken-fried Lamb Steak. It sounds weird, and it's not on the menu at the moment (maybe it's a winter thing?), but it is delicious. Definitely a unique twist on a home style meal. 

People complain about the price, but it's not as expensive as Lola next door. With a restaurant that gets so many rave reviews, it's probably easy to go there for the first time and say that it's overrated, especially if you're caught off-guard by the menu. Just go and try something new!"}
{"text":"Drink with a view? The place to be on the rooftop patio overlooking East 4. This three-leveled suave restaurant is not only great for drinks, but food too. My recent visit I only drank from our hometown brewery, Platform, but have eaten before over a year ago.

The service has always been on point for me and I am an advocate of trying this restaurant for locals and out-of-towners alike. Grab your water bottle and climb the stairs to the top where you cannot regret the rooftop patio view."}
{"text":"While Greenhouse Tavern is a highlight of the 4th Street Promenade Strip, I am only able to give it 3 stars for it's incredible hit & miss offerings.  The very first time I went there the drinks & food were magical - every last thing was spot on delicious!  Since then, the food, service & sadly the drinks have been all over the place.

The drink menu is in a bit of a tumult, the front end manager having departed.  At first glance at the extensive drinks menu, I assumed that some unscrupulous copycat had stolen the mixed drinks page.  Alas, this was not the case -- the bar manager had left, and the drinks menu was getting rejiggered. The server assured us (as they did on each subsequent visit) that the old drinks were just as good as before.  Do not listen!  Stay with something bottled, or venture into new territory, but do not for the love of Pete ever again attempt to order a \"What's He Building\".  A real shame...

As for the food, there are some things that are just always delicious - like the heavenly wings or the clams.  The only thing about the clams is that the numbers are a little sparse.  The tasting menu (first introduced to my party 3 months after regular visits) is the best way to explore the menu.  Unlike a normal tasting menu, Greenhouse gives you full-sized options of your choices, so leave plenty of room.  Just be careful for any surprise add-on costs:  our server pushed the spare rib without mentioning to us that it was a $15 additional charge.

Best place to sit is the patio - the indoors/back of the restaurant can get a little too loud.

All in all, Greenhouse Tavern is a solid go-to place, with palate pleasing drinks & food as long as you don't get experimental with either...don't let the staff scare you off.  While they are usually pretty inattentive, when they do service your table they are a friendly bunch.  Every visit, even on a non-busy week night ended up with the universal question - where did our server go?  I've been trying to get the check for the last 20 minutes...."}
{"text":"Still haven't tried dinner, but had lunch again and it was awesome. It was a pasta special with a brown butter sauce and croutons. It was really tasty with a unique flavor. An egg was on top to add extra flavor/sauce. I'm not an egg yolk person so I skipped that part. The venue was a good lunch venue - not too quiet, not too loud."}
{"text":"Very nice place with good food and good service.

I went to Greenhouse when it was pretty busy (8:30PM) and didn't know what to expect. You walk in past their little outdoor patio area, which most East 4th restaurants have, into a narrow bar/seating area. There is also an upstairs seating area that I did not see.

The bar is nice, the countertop is an interesting material that is almost like concrete with a bunch of pieces of blue glass mixed into it. It looks and feels high-end, as does the rest of the bar area. They carry 4-6 seasonal drafts, and they have a pretty decent selection, they have tons of different wines, and bottles as well. Drafts are a bit pricey at $7-8 compared to other places in the area. Good cocktail menu too.

The food menu is broken up into sections based on portion size: Firsts, Seconds, Thirds, and Halves. Firsts are basically a half appetizer, seconds are a full appetizer, thirds are your entree and halves are sides. This will save you a bit of confusion when you first look at it.

I got the lamb burger, which comes with cheese fondue on it along with a couple of other optional toppings, along with french fries (delicious) and garlic aoli. The burger was delectable, it was cooked perfectly and was one of the best lamb dishes I've had in a while. I didn't dive into the other sections of the menu beyond just grabbing an entree, but I plan to go back and explore the menu even more!

The theme/decor is a bit odd, there are bikes and bike accessories all over and right when you walk in there are two huge shelved walls stacked with VHS tapes. I don't get it, but at the end of the day it does look sort of cool. 

The only downside is that the tables are too close together and you may feel a bit cramped if it's really busy. No complaints about the service, quick and friendly staff.

4.5 stars for drinks

4 stars for venue and atmosphere
5 stars for service"}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in LA.

I suppose hipster, sustainable, organic, farm to table blah blah blah cuisine is not the sole provenance of the west coast, but even the waiters looked like they were directly transported from Silverlake/Los Feliz. 

However, no complaints here because for $44, I got the crispy hominy, chicken wings, HALF A PIG'S HEAD (ok, $4 surcharge there, so $48 total) and turnips (I panicked on my ordering, ok?). 

Everything was great and reviewed far better by everyone else here, except for the turnips. Then again, turnips.

But the pig's head. It had teeth, y'all. And what was either fat around the brain area or just brain, possibly a combination of both. It tasted exactly like pulled pork, with a bit more fat, except you are literally rending flesh off the skull of a pig, which you do not do with pulled pork. 

In other words, amazing."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy when we went, I think there was an Indians game that night or something. Nice atmosphere, two levels. Classy, great food. We got the No Name Frites (animal style Frites?) , Steak Tartare and Beef Shin with yorkshire pudding, root vegetables and mashed potatoes. The Beef Shin with Yorkshire pudding took maybe half an hour to forty five minutes to cook, it was literally the shin of a cow, a huge bone with meat and marrow, we shared between 2-3 of us. The steak tartare was very fresh and delicious. The fries were covered in mozzarella and gravy, topped with bacon and eggs. Everything was seasoned, cooked and tasted great. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I adore this place! I love the decor, the service and especially the food. It's definitely out of the box but it's amazing. They use mostly local and fresh ingredients. The menu changes often. Their veggie burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to show our sister who was visiting from Boston the best of Cleveland. So we brought her to GHT and they most certainly delivered! 
We started with the Crispy Cheese Poofs and Crispy Chicken Wings Confit. Both were delicious, most especially were the wings. Tender, succulent, lots of lemon to cut through the richness and a little heat from the jalapeno.
I had the Strip Steak. Perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth. The garlic and rosemary fries that came alongside were scrumptious as well. My sisters had the Bistro Steak and the Seared Market Fish which was walleye and both dishes received rave reviews. 
If you're looking for a great place to eat in CLE, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"I was not hungry, I just wanted any hot appetizer with beer ... and then I get the best chicken wings I ever tried I mean after 50 countries worldwide and 8 states in US .... the best wings are in this place 
And the Servis was amazing, little pretty Brittany was very kind, patient  and she helped me to choose everything even beer :)
Thank u guys I had perfect time."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It was recommended to me by a New Yorker friend who knows her food, so when I was in Cleveland it was first on my list.

I went for lunch and ordered the grapefruit and fennel salad topped with grilled chicken paillard. Delicious! The greens and citrus are light and well-balanced, and the chicken was massive with perfectly crisped crust. I had a house draft beer to go with it, which was fine. At $18 total, it was a bargain.

The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is that I also ordered a soup, which never arrived. When I pointed that out, the server was very apologetic, and the salad with beer turned out to be plenty of food anyway."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time, I came for dinner with a friend after recently moving to cleveland. The east 4th area itself is very cute and reminds me of being in a larger city. Greenhouse tavern, on the other hand, offers an appealing menu, but it's just too hard to enjoy. The food was way too salty. I saw it commented by other reviewers before I went, but I didn't realize how true it really was. I had the lamb burger and my friend had a steak. We shared poutine. Both of us felt like there wasn't enough water in the world to rehydrate us. If I could, I would bump this place up to 3.5 stars because the second time I went was quite enjoyable. We didn't order any food, just sat upstairs for drinks. The cocktails are inventive and fun. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Full review in blog

Located only two doors down from the oft celebrated but vastly overrated Lola a single look at Chef Jonathon Sawyer's mission statement \"...guided by two principles: the idea that the proximity of the farm and soil to a restaurant correlates to the quality of its food and that environmentally conscious or green business practices are fundamental\" put it high on my list.  A quick perusal of the menu made it a must visit - especially having experienced two of Sawyer's well conceptualized Pizzas at Bar Cento during his tenure there.

Without belaboring my service complaints I will say that my biggest pet peeve aside from bad food is when the front of house doesn't match the chef's skill and vision - this was my complaint at Lola and it most definitely extended down the street to Greenhouse Tavern.

For my appetizer I selected the standard - Salted Foie Gras Torchon with Pickled Lemon Peel, Shallots, Brioche.  Potentially the cheapest foie gras appetizer I've ever tasted the flavor was anything but cheap.  Unctuous foie and buttery brioche proved a standard pairing and both were excellent - what picked this dish up was the sweet/sour lemon peel - a flavor quite unlike anything I've ever tasted and a nice balance for the foie and shallots.  The sea salt added a nice textural component.

Finishing our firsts it was a matter of only 1-2 minutes before my second was brought by an ancillary server - it was set down without explanation and he ambled off without filling my now empty water.  Entitled Soft Egg Omelet - w/ tarragon, chive, stinky cheese, city fresh egg & frisée salad this dish was the weakest of the evening largely because it lacked the subtleties of the other selections.  While the egg was certainly fresh and well made the flavors of tarragon and chive were almost entirely lost under the weight of the potent cheese.  That certainly isn't to say this dish was \"bad\" just that it wasn't quite as well conceptualized as others - I'd not order it again, though.

My selection was a $7 upcharge (this time announced) on the tasting and worth every penny - even if there was no chance I could finish it.  A restaurant signature dish the Half Roasted Chicken in Brioche with fennel, onions, herbs & jus was first presented by Corrine still sealed in the flaky Brioche shell before returning downstairs for plating.  An enormous half chicken the preparation of this dish provided a nearly sous-vide texture to the meat with ample notes of fennel, onions, and herbs much akin to a Thanksgiving Turkey.  To be honest I really have no idea how the brioche maintained its composure with the significant juiciness of the meat and accompanying jus, but none the less it did, providing an almost \"fried chicken\" quality as I paired it as breading for the bird.  A dish absolutely worthy of being called signature this dish was nearly as exceptional as Michael Mina's Lobster Pot Pie as comfort food served in perfect form.  Alas, as good as the chicken was, the previous items had left me already quite full and I only managed to finish 3/4 of the chicken and 2/3 of the frites.

Completely stuffed I deferred on dessert while my companions wanted something sweet to finish - browsing the menu the \"Petit Fours\" plate seemed a perfect option.  Purportedly featuring six small bites ours actually featured only 5 as one was duplicated.  Lacking any description from our server my best guesses as to what was on the plate are a pistachio Lime Cupcake,a Cayenne Truffle, two Cream Cheese Brownie, a Coconut Macaroon, and a Chocolate Chunk Cookie.  All items were clearly pre-made and served cold with only the brownie being better than average - the rest could have easily come from a supermarket bakery and the cookie was worse than Chips Ahoy.  

Receiving our bill I didn't want to raise a fuss since the prices at Greenhouse Tavern are a downright bargain - but I did circle the Anima Frites supplement to make a subtle point - it was removed.  With incredible savories and an extremely subpar dessert I left the restaurant with mixed feelings.  Certainly if I lived in or around Cleveland I would gladly return to see what Sawyer was putting out of the kitchen, but with so many other options yet to explore (Dante, Moxie, etc) it would be hard to justify rushing back - great food and poor service does not make for a destination restaurant.  In the end I echo my comments above about the front of house not keeping up with the chef - I found this to be the case at Lola and Spiaggia as well - each chef putting out superb food but the service lackluster to the point I don't know I'd return - for Spiaggia - no way, for Lola - maybe, for Greenhouse - the verdict is still out."}
{"text":"Went back to Cleveland to visit old friends and took them out to dinner at the Tavern, which none of us had been to before.  We had a fantastic meal and the service was excellent.  The reasonable wine list gave us an opportunity to try a new wine, which was so good I ordered a case when I returned to California.  I had the steak frites with Ohio beef and it was delicious.  Finished every bit.  My friends enjoyed the crepe and the vichyssoise - both excellent.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped by Greenhouse Tavern finally (after 10 years!) and had only an appetizer and some beer.  One of these days, we'll have to stop back for a full meal.

We ordered some peppers and some fried pig skin.  It was covered with a curry type seasoning, but was good.  It had a nice kick to it.  A couple pieces of the pig skin were so hard that we couldn't chew them. 

My wife and I sat and drank a couple beers on their patio on East 4th and people watched. What a nice place to people watch in the summer time.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner Friday night, sat in the kitchen a fun place to be! Love the beef tartare!!! Yummy! Chef Goldman does an outstanding Job! Loved Loved the Bucket of fried chicken and The Giant Size Steak so delicious! Our wait staff EXTREMLY professional and very knowledgeable of all the entrees!! Jonathon you got it goin on there!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the second time that I have been to the Greenhouse Tavern and been greeted promptly in the 10+ times that I have been. The bartender began by being very efficient with a less than half full bar. I have been disappointed times in this key area and was pleasantly surprised this time that we were greeted and followed up with promptly. 

After that the service definitely became less impressive. I ordered and attempted a substitution for my personal vegetarian dietary reasons but the bartender attempted to talk me out of it. Upon receiving our food, we had to wait several minutes to get someones attention to have silverware. Then as we began eating the dishes I realized that what I ordered was not what was delivered. Although it was excellent, it is not what I ordered and I asked the bartender to explain. However the mix-up, and the fact I thought it was delicious, I still think good customer service practice would require he change the bill to reflect the price of what I DID want, and he did not. I was charged for the bartender's mistake. 

So, to summarize-prompt greeting, no silverware, lackluster service, did not get the feeling of vegetarian friendly, no accommodations for mistake of bartender and final bill was extremely expensive. I know personally how much care and time has gone in this establishment, but I have yet to see that reflect in the service. I usually feel the attitude of \"we are doing you a favor by waiting on you\" not an attitude of let's take care of our customer's needs."}
{"text":"I've been to the Greenhouse before and had good service, but my visit yesterday left a lot to be desired. I always order the double decker rice and bean burger vegan. This time, they brought out just the 2 patties with no bread. When I asked, they said they could bring a different bun. That took about 5 minutes. Then I realized there wasn't any type of condiment on the burger, so I asked for some mustard. That took another 10 minutes. By then, my burger was sad and cold. Wish the team would have explained the bun and condiment sitch when I ordered so I could have had everything ready to go when my order arrived. For $25, I think this should have gone down a little differently (I had a beer with my burger). Places shouldn't advertise about being vegan-friendly if they can't deliver the same level of service as they do to non-vegan diners, just sayin'!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty terrible experience on a Thursday night last week. The drinks took 25 minutes to come after ordering (mind you they were bottled beers). Our waitress was very nice but she was so slow and seemed very overwhelmed. The medium rare strip steak was PURPLE when it came out.  It was barely seared on the outside. That's fine we still like it mooing and bloody but this was pretty hard to look at since it was practically raw. They said it was 11ozs; more than half of that was fat. I ordered the lamb burger with no cheese and no yogurt sauce. When they brought it out it had no bun and had cheese so I had to send it back and sit there for even longer.  77 dollars for this dinner was not worth it. We can go to Flemings and have a 5 star experience for a better steak and service for the same price.  Also, because I have been here during lunch hours and have loved the Caesar salad that is why I'm giving 2 stars otherwise it would be 1 star."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Other servers came to assist when our server was busy. 
Prime rib was enough for two or more! Animal fries are a must. 
Delicious food. Good service. And they take reservations even when the cavs are playing! A+"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get! Good service; non GMO food, but burger was chewy and without flavor, appetizers are tiny for the price, restaurant and outdoor tables could be cleaner, upstairs outdoor bar had empty glasses and beer cans EVERYWHERE , though it was a crowded Friday night.  Cocktails were mediocre ( Moscow mule, orange crush, warm white wine). The must-cut-with-a-steak-knife Chocolate-peanut butter rice Krispy dessert, a tiny slice for $13, was something I could have made at home in 5 minutes-- this from their culinary pastry chef. Disappointing! If you want natural and locally grown foods, try Ohio City's Town Hall; selections taste better and are a much better value."}
{"text":"Pig face and ribs bigger than my head? Sign me up!

I somehow ended up here in each of my last two Cleveland trips, and both times I left disgustingly full and happy. On the first trip, three of us tried to tackle the pig head and animal fries. The pig face was nothing short of amazing; you will need to be a fan of gelatinous soft and fatty tissue to enjoy. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/greenhouse-tavern-cleveland?select=ayLsHTffjnry0S2BwqTucQ#ayLsHTffjnry0S2BwqTucQ

The picture doesn't do it justice nor does it show how big it really was. The face plus the fries would have been enough for six people, but we three made a good showing. The meat around the face was superb, with each bite containing a nice layer of unadulterated melting fatty goodness. The only downside was that it had TONS of fat, delicious delicious fat, but it got to be too much at the end. 

West-coaster, the animal fries here share nothing in common with our beloved animal style fries from In-N-Out, but they're still damn good. On both trips we ordered the lardon, gravy, cheese, mustard, and fried egg topped mountains of spuds, and both times we couldn't finish it. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/greenhouse-tavern-cleveland?select=cEXIjkyo6Ql4JlTRN0OpZw#cEXIjkyo6Ql4JlTRN0OpZw

The foie clams did not have any solid piece of foie, as it apparently had been melted down into the broth. Not a total waste as the broth was some of the best we've ever had, but the dish only came with eight calms in total, a bit of a rip off. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/greenhouse-tavern-cleveland?select=i3oBQ5OewSayxcRPx7QK3A#i3oBQ5OewSayxcRPx7QK3A

And the hero on our second trip was the Flintstone style short-rib. The single rib came with the meat already off the bone, but given how tender it was it would have fell off anyways. The meat was nothing short of amazing; it was everything you'd want from short ribs, fork tender and full of flavor. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/greenhouse-tavern-cleveland?select=9SE0lDMsqZSBmhBv_UO0jA#9SE0lDMsqZSBmhBv_UO0jA

Both times we avoided reservations by walking in and eating at the bar. Cool spot in the heart of the only cool part of downtown Cleveland. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ummm, maybe I didn't order the right brews/food?

My friend and I came here, in celebration of CBW. Yes, yes, we did. I felt a tad odd to be the only girl in the back area, but hey, it's CBW, why not!

We ordered the Saison flight- stone, I don't remember the names...but there were four of them- one from Dogfish, Stone, Victory...and something else. They were okay.

We got the paired appetizer samplings. Oh, so not impressed with the appetizers. Enough so, that even though we were having a good convo... it was worth leaving to get better food. The Petit Crudetes were crunchy, but not flavorful. We had some type of pate... which was actually good. And then horribly crispy hominy. Oh man, not so good. It was way too hard, salty, just.. not fun to eat or even try to bite into for that matter.

I liked the decor and the feel of this place, don't get me wrong. There was a gigantic canvas painting on the wall with a woman on it... which was great. It was colorful, hip- it just fit the restaurant. I haven't really tried any of the brews here...but really? I just didn't think it was just that great."}
{"text":"Came here again for a double date. Will have to say that Greenhouse Tavern is a great place for a group date especially when the couple doesn't know each other well or it's the first or second date or so. 

This time, ordered the mushrooms, chili garlic chicken wings and regular poutine for the appetizers. Mushrooms were tiny for 13$. My boyfriend joked that the waiter maybe dropped 4/5 of the dish because there was like maybe 2 small mushrooms per person on the plate. Not worth 13$. Regular poutine is way smaller than the animal poutine. Would recommend animal style poutine over regular poutine. The chicken wings were the highlight and the redeeming aspect of the night. Love the limey-ness of the chicken wings. Bf was not a fan but then again he doesn't like sour stuff too much. 

Entree - ordered the flinstone shortrib for the four of us to share. Dry. Pig face I had last time was too oily but the ribs were too dry :(. Also wish they brought the free bread out earlier. Waiter tried to upsell us by saying we didn't order enough for the four of us. But in reality the ribs enough was way too much. 

Dessert - cream pot - I thought there was supposed to be popcorn with this. My friend loved this. I enjoyed the salty caramel on top. 

Bottom line, recommend getting the foie gras mussels that I reviewed earlier and the chili chicken wings."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a friends birthday ... fabulous!  The ladies ordered the chef's tasting which permits 1 selection from each course off the standard menu.  Unbelievable appetizers, seconds and main entrees.  Our final course selections varied from gravy frites (unbelievable) to a roasted beet dish (crazy good).  Do not skip dessert here!  Besides having the best ice cream on earth (Jeni's from Columbus!) the caramel chocolate cote de creme is heaven.  

Great atmosphere, long bar and multi-level seating ... we were fortunate enough to be seated on the top floor along the front window and could people watch all the 4th street foot traffic."}
{"text":"If I had to sum up the fare at Greenhouse Tavern, I'd say it's both tasty and extremely rib-sticking.

The food, which is local and fresh, is VERY hearty and probably not for someone trying to keep his/her hourglass figure. With selections like Roasted Pig's Head, Beef Shin, and Chicken Fried Lamb Steak, you can see what I mean.

We started with the Animal Style Frites, which were unfreakinbelievable. The frites were cooked in duck fat (!) and smothered with brown gravy, amazing mustard, two fried eggs, bacon and mozzarella cheese curd. As a long-time lover of Yours Truly's Notso Fries, I can safely say I have found their more sophisticated equivalent at Greenhouse.

For the main event, I had the Chicken Fried Lamb Steak, which was really tasty and served with a strongly vinegar'ed cabbage slaw and creamy mashed potatoes. My sister had a lamb burger, which was good as well, although it would have been nice if it came with something more than garlic and cheese on it. My mom had the pumpkin and duck pasta which, while I thought it was fine, she wasn't a big fan of. I think we all assumed it'd have larger chunks of duck in it and a heavier pumpkin flavor.

Dessert was good, but not great. We had the vegan Butterscotch Pudding. It definitely had a unique flavor, but didn't blow us away. Next time, as strange as it sounded on the menu, I'll try the Buttered Popcorn Pot de Creme.

Due to the heavy nature of the food, I probably won't be back here for a while but I'll be thinking about those Animal Style Frites all winter long."}
{"text":"The menu is wonderful. The fried brussels sprouts are amazing. Without a doubt the desserts are the best. My favorite is the creamsicle! A MUST have. The decor is funky and fun!"}
{"text":"It's a good place for what it is: quirky ambience, great rooftop, cool chef's searing downstairs. But the food isn't good: everything is overly salty (like please scrap it off my tongue) and oily. Every time I got (usually work related dinners), it's so much meat and oil. I can drain the oil off my poutine and cook an entirely different entree with it. Even the half pig face, which is genuinely pretty good, isn't cooked for long and slow enough for the fat to render into the meat, and there's definitely too much salt in the bark (the outside where the spices are applied). I really want to like this place but I cannot. Sadface."}
{"text":"We went there for happy hour before a show at PlayhouseSquare and immensely enjoyed the wine, chicken wings confit, frites with mayo, lamb crepinette, and the heirloom tomato risotto.  All excellent!

Love the atmsophere, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Service was great! We ordered the pigs head and Fred Flintstone beef ribs which were both delicious. I couldn't stop eating them!"}
{"text":"Never been a fan of this place. Every time I come back (only two more times) I remember why. We walk in at 5 pm. Happy Hour time. Not a bartender to be found for 15 minutes. No joke. We wait. And wait. And wait. I suggest hopping over the bar and grabbing some drinks on my own. Surely a bartender would appear then. My husbands recommends that I don't do that. So we continue waiting. FINALLY he shows up and helps all the other patrons that were on empty since he was apparently gone for 30 minutes. THEN we get to have drinks. Now the bar is packed, but there's one little bar table right next to the bar that we're sitting at. We're told we can't have happy hour prices if we're at this bar table...only if we're at the bar. 

Are you f'n kidding me? We wait that long and can touch the bar from the table and it doesn't count as \"the bar\"? Screw you Greenhouse. After 2 horrible (and soaked in duck fat) meals and this experience I've learned my lesson. Three strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"Came up here for valentines dinner and for a house of Blues concert after. Overall atmosphere in here is laid back casual, my kind of place. Food is definitely original, everything was good in its own way, it lost a star because I left certain things are over seasoned and maybe gone a tad too far. 
We ordered fried pig ears as an appetizer, they were fantastic, crunchy, lots of flavor. Also we did the Brussel sprouts, easily the best I've ever had!
My entree was the ground beer tartare, and WOW! It was fantastic, but with some of the sauces it started to lose me, I was hoping for one to just accent the beef and blow me away, unfortunately the tartare was best alone, there was no marriage between sauce choices and the protein, but the tartare was done so well it didn't need it! 
My side was frites with garlic and rosemary. This is where it got too much, the rosemary made no sense. It may just be my opinion but it was just so overwhelming with a bad taste, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, it was 90% rosemary, 9% potato, 1% other.
But overall we're up for greenhouse, I do love this place so far, I love the originality even if the taste isn't working for me in some areas.
The final part of our greenhouse dining experience was dessert. For me, I saw pistachio ice cream and had to go for it. I've thought a lot about pistachio ice cream lately, watching a lot of cooking shows and watching them make ice cream, this is one I wanted to try. And you guys killed it, it was nutty and had some crunch in it, it tastes just like pistachio, it was fantastic. The cream with the wafers... comparable to the rosemary and frites, not a good flavor, to be honest, barley edible. There appears to be a ying and yang on every plate.

Overall 4/5, easily a 5 if they tighten up recipes a bit and make them make more sense.

Atmosphere 5/5- more laid back, casual, I like the theme
Taste 4/5- just small things that make whole dishes feel off
Value 3/5- I just don't think the quality of the menu items are there to be charging the prices they do, not quite at a Lola tier yet, sorry Sawyer.

I feel like I'm being very critical of this place, considering I've given 5 stars to less but it's the expectation with the price tag and I just feel like it's not delivering. 
I'll definitely be back for part two and try that delmonico, maybe I'll be completely editing this review after that."}
{"text":"The food is very good. Really really good wings. Flavors in everything were great. If you can't decide, get the lamb burger - it is out of this world. A bit pricey. Nonetheless, this spot shouldn't be less than 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and my Eugene Porter from Revolution Brewing was also, predictably, excellent. Interior was awesome with bicycles mounted to the walls and suspended from the ceiling. Bike wheel light fixtures were an innovative delight.

I had high, high hopes for the food but it was a letdown. Granted, it was mid-day and the tavern offered an abbreviated menu. But the confit chicken wings were so overwhelmingly salty as to be nearly inedible, and the abrasive lemon tang certainly didn't help. The combo was unbearable. On the other end of the spectrum, the animal style frites (basically poutine) somehow seemed completely bland to the point where the cheese curds, fries, fried eggs and gravy all kinda tasted the same. The dish was saved only by the heap of whole grain mustard and bacon. My boyfriend was much hungrier than me so he chowed down without complaint but I just couldn't stomach either dish.

If I'm ever back in Cleveland, I would probably return here for a beer AND to try the decadent-sounding bread & butter board. It comes with a medley of.....as they put it, \"house jams, conserves, yogurts, spreads, schmears, dips, butters & rendered fatty animal love served w/ grilled bread, pugliese, house crackers & country bread.\" Mmm...Til then, this is an unfortunate 2 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty great! In a lively area of Cleveland. Great atmosphere with lovely patio seating. Solid menu with local fare. Ohio beef, lamb, and pork. As well as lake walleye fish and local veg. Everything is prepared with care and tastes pretty good. Had the tomato salad, the fried chicken, a burger and the pig head. If you are with a group get the big head! Only complaint is the service is a little slow. But the service everywhere in the area is slow. So whatever."}
{"text":"One of the go-to downtown Cleveland restaurants. The only place I have ever liked Kale (salad)."}
{"text":"Four thumbs up for The Greenhouse Tavern! My husband and I came in for a date night / early birthday dinner. We used our wonderful resource (server) Alice to guide us through the menu. She did a lovely job pairing our tastes with menu favorites. We started with the brussels and chicken wings. We can't stop thinking / talking / dreaming about the brussels sprouts... I mean... Not to downplay the wings because dang. For our entree, we split the short ribs which was plentiful enough for 2, especially with a side of frites. Oh wait! I forgot to mention... my Old Fashioned was done 100% right... like definitely one of the best I've had. We had the pistachio dessert as well as the pot de creme. You can't go wrong with either but get the pot de creme, trust me. If we weren't relocating out of Cleveland, this would be our go-to for all of our \"special\" nights out. 

Hey Alice, you're amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been here three times tried their market fish, dried pastrami sandwich, and curry. Their curry disappointed me the most. I felt the chef is trying to innovate but don't know how. All their food taste kinda weird to me."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed.  I had read such good reviews and had high hopes, but I didn't think the food or service was all that great.

What was great?  The fact that this used to be an old store of some sort and they put tables in the front windows, which make it a great place to people watch.  The other awesome thing was the fact they showed \"Another Stakeout\" in the bar.  Yes, that amazing piece of cinematography  staring Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O'Donnell and Dennis Farina (RIP).

Anyway, I ordered a drink to start.  It was a \"Spring Fling\" and was a strawberry like cocktail with basil and vodka.  It was ok.  It had a very vinegar like taste to it... Not worth the $12 I spent on it.

On to my entree.. Given I was in Ohio, near Lake Erie, I had to get the walleye.  Duh...I will say it was delicious.  Very fresh.  Well cooked.  The skin nice and crispy and I loved the kalmata olive puree/sauce it was served with.  Not too salty, but a perfect contrast to the freshness of the fish. The thing that that irks me was that was all it was.. A piece of fish.  No side dish to mention.  No vegetable, really.  It came with a couple of inedible brussel sprouts (rock hard, you could barely cut them with a knife) and a small red potato that were quartered.  The fish was great, but I was still really hungry after.. So I ordered dessert.  That was the best part of the meal.

I followed other Yelpers instructions and ordered the Buttered Popcorn Pot De Creme.  It was AWESOME!  It's basically a small dish (but filling) of creme brulee with caramel sauce and sea salt on top.  It was delicious.  My mouth is watering as I write this.  I also ordered a cappuccino, which was delicious.

Overall, I ended up spending $75 on a meal I thought was ok, at best.

It didn't really live up to the hype I was hoping for.  There are a lot of other restaurants in that area to try out."}
{"text":"I  loved this place last time I was in Cleveland and knew I had to come back this visit.

The experience did not disappoint.

My friend and I sat at the bar I ordered a drink and he wanted a beer but being unfamiliar with the Cleveland beer scene left it up to the very friendly barmaid to choose. She chose perfectly as he was very pleased.

We had the breads and spreads. My friend ate about a pound of butter! I loved the house made crispy wafers served with it. 

Dinner was port chop for him, cooked perfectly with just a touch of pink and nicely presented. I did the animal frites, made it about 1/4 way through and gave up that battle.

We had  a good time just hanging out relaxing, talking to the barmaid. 

I'll be back here everytime I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to find a restaurant that focuses on local food production, serves a diverse and delicious menu, and at the same time offers top notch service. Thank you Greenhouse Tavern! 

The space itself is modern yet it surprisingly still manages to be warm and comforting. There are two large dining areas on the main floor and on the second floor balcony, but there are also tables tucked into little nooks near the entry (allowing you to look out onto E. 4th and people watch) or ample seating at the bar. The music varies (the staff gets to pick create their own mixes) so when we walked in for dinner it was pretty hardcore rock, but by the time we had appetizers the mood had switched to more classic rock from the 70s (much more palatable when you're dining for a few hours). I was surprised to see a variety of other diners ranging from couples out on date nights to hip families bringing along one or two kids. 

Our server Jay, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, navigating our party of 3 through the menu and explaining in detail the various ingredients in a dish. The water glasses were never empty and Jay checked in on us frequently. GREAT service. 

The food was equally as good. There is definitely a meat focused lean in the menu, though the Greenhouse proudly indicates both vegetarian and vegan menu items too. With your bread you'll receive a pork-laden spread, but the goat's milk butter cheese under \"firsts\" is worth getting for the table. I enjoyed the seasonal soup, a chilled squash that had some kick to it. Though I rarely order chicken when I'm out, how can you not when it's been voted \"the best in Cleveland\"? The 1/2 chicken baked into the brioche is certainly worth trying though the portion is so large I'd recommend splitting it along with several smaller items. The meat was extremely moist and I was sad I didn't have room left to eat more. Definitely try the local beer too - there was a delicious saison that I liked so much I had two glasses (another rarity for me). 

From the length of the review you can tell I enjoyed my experience here. That's what I'm looking for when I dine...not just a meal but an experience and that's exactly what I got at Greenhouse Tavern."}
{"text":"Greenhouse Tavern is in my opinion, far and away the best dining experience currently available in Cleveland.  The dishes prepared by Jonathon Sawyer and staff are just simply at a level beyond anything else I've experienced here.  The wait staff is incredibly friendly and attentive but very subtle so you get all you need without feeling pestered.  My wife and I keep trying to branch out elsewhere but just find ourselves craving a GHT visit each time we have a night out.  Well, here and Noodlecat but that's another review :-)  If you have not yet tried, do yourself a favor and get here."}
{"text":"Oh my dear sweet Lord. The FOOD here.

I tagged along on a quick work trip my husband took to Cleveland, and when The  Greenhouse Tavern popped up on a few restaurant lists, I made a reservation and to East 4th Street we went. We were expecting good things (a James Beard Award nomination tends to heighten the anticipation), and boy, did they deliver. 

We started with two excellent cocktails and stuck to the small plates list, but after the tartare, confit chicken wings, frites, and a potato salad whose name escapes me now--probably because it was the one thing I didn't like--we were stuffed full. 

We ate on the patio, which was amazing, because the street is completely closed off to traffic and full of other restaurants with patios and complete with bistro lights strung between the buildings. Magical! 

Just about everything we ate was so, so superlative, and we kind of want to move to Cleveland just so we can go more often. That makes sense, right?"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to turn in my  Buffalo Card-- the one that allows you to scoff at bad weather, people who can't drive in snow and chicken wings of non-Buffalonian origin.  I found the best chicken wings on the planet-- and they are at the Greenhouse Tavern.  (Not at the Anchor Bar, God forgive me.)  

The chicken itself is of exceptional quality.  Obviously organic and free range.  It was the most flavorful underlying chicken in a wing I have ever tasted.  The outside is supremely crispy and delicate.  They are subtlely flavored with garlic and a bit of something else-- je ne sais quoi.

Our other app was eye opening as well-- bread and butter.  OK, what could anyone possibly do with grilled bread and butter.  Hmmm-- goat's milk butter-- whiter, creamier and tangier than any cow could produce? 

Our entrees were equally spectacular. Nothing was overly complicated, just simple, elegant and perfectly prepared.  My flounder with shaved fennel melded a delicious fish that was not overpowered by the delicate taste of fennel and citrus.  The accompanying mussles were mindblowing-- they were completely delicate and tender without a hint of chewiness or gaminess.  I didn't realize that mussles could be like that.  Mon cher chou's chicken was as flavorful as the wings, although it would have benefited by a few of the gnocci that accompanied my dish.

Dessert was a delight.  I had ginger mango clafouti.  I just love saying that .  Clafouti. Clafouti.  Clafouti.  Yum.    Mon cher chou's  cookies and ice cream were even better.  Three hommade cookies, bursting with complex flavor and creamy, delicate homemade coconut ice cream.  

The service is very, very cool, casual and friendly.  The servers are obviously foodies!  

So I willingly forsake some B-lo cred for such stunning food!  Fair cop!"}
{"text":"Preface:

 This is definitely a situation that begs a \"half-star\" allowance in the rating system.  I'd like the give GHT 2.5 stars based on our experience.  Since no half star is available, and most reviews are positive, I am opting for the lower 2 star rating to weigh our unfortunately somewhat negative experience more weight.

Carry on:


After having several earsful of yammering about how wonderful the Greenhouse Tavern is from both friends and my trusted electronic sources, I decided to make it a point to finally visit for a birthday dinner.

In preparation I started studying the menu and began salivating days in advance as I wrestled with the difficult choices.  I made a reservation for our group, and looked forward to the visit. 

We arrived a bit early, and were both surprised and happy that our table was ready.  We were quickly seated and waited for the rest of our group to arrive so we could get down to business.  

Unfortunately, it was around this point that things kind of took a turn service-wise, and it really put a damper on the rest of the evening.  

Essentially, from the moment our server came to take our drinks we were treated to a pretty condescending tone lasted the duration of our visit.  As the rest of our group filtered in, they remarked on the attitude as well.  Most of them were surprised, as nearly everyone had eaten at GHT before (some of them frequently), and could confirm that the service we were getting was not the norm.  As we moved on and ordered our food and drinks, we continued to get more of the same, and the end result is that it really made the experience kind of a drag.

On a positive note, the food was excellent.  It lived up to all of the hype, and everyone in our group seemed to enjoy their orders.  The Chicken Fried Lamb Steak was something I'll be craving in the future, and the animal style frites were an over-the-top taste sensation that my arteries are still cursing.  I think GHT mostly lived up to its culinary reputation, and while I understand that our service that night is an anomaly, it soured me enough that I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"This is one of the hipper, more popular places on Fourth Street.  I went here for beers and dinner with a friend recently.  We had a good time.  The place isn't cheap but that's not really why you come here.  The food is excellent.  The chicken wings here are positively out of site.  I've never had better.  The flavor was amazing and the meat just fell off the bones.  Wow!

The beer selection wasn't quite as varied as I'd hoped when choosing this place but they were tasty.  Our server was on top of his game and never let our beers or our waters get empty.   He recommended the meatball and that's what I got.  That's right - a single meatball.  It's made with everything BUT ground beef - pork, veal, sweetbreads, all that rich, yummy stuff.

They have an ample amount of outdoor seating, which is nice when the weather cooperates.

Not the cheapest place I've ever been.  My buddy paid the tab but I got a quick look - almost $80 for the two of us.  Hmmmmm....."}
{"text":"I was told this place was amazing so 4 of us went to dinner after an event at the convention center. We were sat upstairs in one of the loft areas. Noise was not too bad. The typical range. 
The service was very attentive. 
The prices to the amount you get on your plate ranges from what we had but leans towards the leaner side of what is given on your plate. 
I had the fried brussels sprouts which was delicious. The Ohio lamb burger was very juicy but the champagne shallots were a little too raw for my taste but could have been my preference. 
I appreciated all the whiskey cocktails and really enjoyed mine (I forgot which one). 
Overall it was a very nice and delicious spot for dinner. Just a bit higher priced."}
{"text":"This review is based on my Happy Hour experience at The Greenhouse Tavern.

I really enjoy sitting at the bar drinking some HH special and munching on Crispy Chicken Confit Wings ($9). Service was fast and friendly. 

I am though a little confused about why the wings is called \"crispy\" wings? Their saltiness though was a perfect match for beers.

Love the deco and the vibe of the restaurant itself and will consider coming here for dinner next time when I am in town!"}
{"text":"The tasting menu for $44 is an absolute bargain:  four full courses of deliciousness without any real restrictions...you can't beat it.

Service was excellent.  We sat outside on a warm, wonderful April night.  

My colleagues were a little skeptical of a \"local, organic\" restaurant--they like stuffy steakhouses most of the time.  The food at Greenhouse Tavern blew them away...especially the Animal Style frites.  

I preferred the rib chop and the salad courses--but everything was stellar.  

Don't miss this place..."}
{"text":"Was so anxious to try this popular Cleveland spot and was totally let down! Cool vibe but overpriced for the portions and my meal was luke warm at best."}
{"text":"Wings, Fried Chicken, Clams, Brussel Sprouts.....you simply can't go wrong.  Hands down the best restaurant in the city.  The most progressive, continually innovative kitchens in Cleveland.  Spectacular service, bar and beverage selection.  Bring your friends and try to get a seat at The Chef's Table.  Have  a blast!"}
{"text":"\"Refreshing at point of Contact\"

Parking next to Chocolate Bar made our walk less than 2 min to restaurant. First time for dinner and it was great. Hostess, Bussers, and Wait staff were friendly and helpful. Everyone seemed to enjoy working there. We sat in the upper level and felt like we received plenty of attention to our water refills and food came out fast and delicious. At one point my contact lens dried out and asked the Busser if he knew anyone with contact solution. He returned with Visine for Contacts within minutes and a small ramekin to boot! Highly recommended for 4th street dining. Everything from high end steak and seafood to burgers and fries quality is very very high. You can even compliment the kitchen staff with a special option on the menu I'll let you find for yourself:)"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed on the first try. Don't think I'd go back considering all the other food options around the area. That being said, there was some upside to my experience. The fried chicken was crispy, and succulent albeit overpriced. I didn't like the gravy fries at all because of the gravy. The flavor just wasn't a good gravy flavor. Others in my party ordered kale salad, burgers, other stuff... nobody loved their meal. Our server was really slow and seemed confused most of the time. I really wanted to give them 2 stars, but I like the fact that they have unusual items on the menu, and the location/decor is funky and fresh."}
{"text":"A few doors down from Lola lies Greenhouse Tavern, my new must-visit restaurant in downtown Cleveland.  The 4-course tasting menu is already a steal at $39, but the best part is that you have full access to the entire menu.  You get your choice of any dish from the First, Seconds, and Thirds sections of the menu for your first three courses, then either a dish from the Halfs or a dessert.  I wasn't feeling anything from the Firsts menu, but they were nice enough to accommodate swapping in something from the Halfs, then throwing in a dessert.  

My tasting started with the Chilled Soup of the day, Vichyssoise.  The potato and leek flavor was delicious, and a sprinkling a crumbled croutons added some nice textural changes to the velvety smooth soup.  I'm used to my soups served hot or in a bread bowl, but this is a perfect dish on a warm Spring day.  My second course was the Gravy Frites, a high end version of Canadian Poutine.  The fries were crisp (did I mention they're fried in duck fat?), and topped with a generous helping of billowy cheese curds and brown gravy.  I can see why Michael Symon from Lola loves this dish, it's awesome.  For my third course I had the Sea-2 Table Market Fish (Halibut on this day), yet another perfect dish for the season.  The Halibut was perfectly seared and paired nicely with a savory onion purée.  This balanced well with the bright citrus notes in the butter lettuce salad.  I really thought the meal couldn't get any better, but then I was presented with the Caramel Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme for dessert.  It was out-freakin'-standing and nowhere near as sweet as one might think.  The added touch of sea salt also brought a nice balance to the dish.  So how good was it?  So good that it rivals Lola's 6 A.M. Special for my favorite dessert in all of Cleveland.  Too bad it's not socially acceptable to lick your plates clean, otherwise I would've given back one spotless serving dish to the waitress.  One a side note, spicy food lovers can request the addition of Ghost Chili (the hottest pepper in the world) to any dish on the menu.  I wasn't feeling quite so brave this time around, but may consider it next time I feel like burning a few taste buds off my tongue.

In addition to the food, they also have a creative cocktail list.  I went with the Jon Collins which was damn good, particularly if you're a Bourbon fan.  Throw in some friendly, down-to-earth service and Greenhouse Tavern easily earns a 5-star review.  Yahoooo!!"}
{"text":"I received a gift card to Greenhouse Tavern for Christmas from a coworker and had a chance to check it out a few weekends ago.  We had a 6:30 reservation and it was very quiet when we arrived, but within the hour, the place got very busy! Everything about this place is impeccable.  The drinks are outstanding and creative. The service is fantastic.

Husband and I both did the tasting menu.  I started with the fromage blanc, which was light and delicious. I had the chicken wings second, which everyone at the table agreed were absolutely amazing.  They have the perfect sauce on them!  For my entree, I had the steak frites and I was very happy with it - perfectly cooked steak and crispy frites with just-right seasoning.

The husband's favorite were the bacon-wrapped dates, which he said were delicious but left him wanting more. 

The couple we were with were equally impressed with their meals.

Everyone at the table had dessert and raved about them.  We decided that we had to come back - like, as soon as possible - because it was one of the best dinners we've had.  Preferably, next time with a taxi so I can indulge in more than one of those delicious drinks!"}
{"text":"Mediocre over priced food and drinks.  When you pay $18 bucks for a burger it should be a great burger. Rib steak highly recommended just ok. Wings over spiced. Find it funny that people believe the hype so much. Those that say the rib steak is the best they ever had need to go to a Morton's sometime. Rooftop bar is cool,  but got tab for 4 drinks at 50 bucks I about fell off roof.."}
{"text":"Fail! What a GIANT disappointment. 
Jonathon Sawyer should be embarrassed by what he is presenting here. 
I was visiting Cleveland from Denver with high expectations about the food scene. 
Here is what I can say with certainty-
Don't go to this place- It appears  they stopped giving a shit a long time ago based on the awful food, presentation, and collective shitty ass service.
Do go get a gyro at Steve's Gyros in West Side Market and tacos at Barrrio- those stops made it possible for me to forget this Greenhouse thing ever happened."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a group of folks.  We decided to order a bunch of different items and share them.  Out of the 15 different things we ordered, only 1 was \"meh\".  The rest were all very good.  The waitress was helpful and friendly.  The decor is kitschy, which is fine with me.  It's on a nice little cobblestone street in downtown Cleveland with a bunch of other restaurants."}
{"text":"After a show at the House of Blues, my boyfriend, brother and myself were looking for some late night eats. Anticipating my first experience at the Greenhouse Tavern (after reading so many wonderful Yelp reviews) I suggested we grab a table on the patio and enjoy the evening.  

The hostess seated us and handed us the late night menu. Now, I do not date a small man. My 6'4\" boyfriend hesitantly sat down on the tiny metal chair provided, praying that it would support his frame over the course of the meal. Thankfully, it did, but its not the most comfortable situation for a large man to be in.

Drink order: I requested a glass of the house red and a Coke for my brother (who is fifteen).  Instead of being offered whatever cola the bar uses for mixed drinks, the waitress brought us a Grown Up Soda Dry Cola that markets itself as \"100% natural\" and \"Not Too Sweet\". Don't get me wrong, its not a bad soda, but my 15 year old brother's non-discerning palate didn't know the difference. Essentially we were up-sold on a product we didn't want.

Dinner order: The late night menu offered a number of fine options. My boyfriend opted for the risotto, which he could not stop eating. My brother had the famous burger, another great choice.  I however, had the booby prize. I chose a tomato / mayo sandwich. Although it tasted delightful (particularly the mayo), the portion was laughable. It was essentially the size of a biscotti. I left unfulfilled and went home to enjoy a turkey sandwich. 

All that said, I would give the Greenhouse Tavern another shot, but only when their full menu is available.  If that happens, I will update this review."}
{"text":"Everything that I have tried here was great. The wings were not typical Buffalo style, nonetheless, one of the best wings I have tried in my entire life. The burger was pretty damn good. He said the beef is local and butchered in house. No antibiotics or any of the weird things they do to cows, so that is reassuring. The bread and butter was also great. I did not think bread and butter would blow my mind, it did. The server was very helpful. A great experience. One of my favorites in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love Greenhouse Tavern! I've never had a bad meal, they have the BEST wings in town, and they have an incredible rooftop patio. Seriously, have you tried the wings, they are unique and completely insane! Go get them now!"}
{"text":"Traveling through Cleveland, I found this tavern to be really excellent -- oddly, I have pretty fond memories of Cleveland on the part of this place, Lola's for a dinner, and the Hyatt in one of the oldest malls in America.

Had a vintage cider which was far more complex and astonishing than any other alcoholic cider (Magner's and the like). Downside was that the cider was pretty expensive ($25?) but it seemed to have a heritage on par with wine.

Nice bartenders, cool interior design. Loved it."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant in a cute little part of Cleveland.  I stopped by only for dessert and ordered the chocolate cake and it was absolutely delicious!  The best part was that it came with a shot of milk which I thought was genius.  My friends enjoyed their animal fries a lot, which was topped with cheese,  bacon,  and other toppings.  I will say that it was an expensive restaurant so I'm glad I wasn't terribly hungry.  We had a great waitress and the atmosphere was really nice!  I think it would be cool to try other items in the future"}
{"text":"Awesome for lunch. The market fish (with pesto and greens) was really good but the portion was way too small. Also got something off the menu that the server suggested -- clams, shrimp, and fish in light sauce with french fries. Decadent, delicious, so good, I would eat two more plates right now if I could. Overall, wonderful ambience, although it does get packed at lunch but if you show up at 1, the place is basically clearing out. My boss ordered the beef dip and said the jus and beef were good but the crusty bread made it hard to eat. Pomme frites are crunchy and nicely seasoned, on the salty side but I'm a salt lover. I guess they are known for having vegan options which I noticed on the menu, but plenty of options for us hearty eaters also."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago, when my buddy and I drove up to watch the Reds vs Indians. I had asked several chefs where to check out in Cleveland and they all suggested Greenhouse Tavern. 

Our server was Jody and he was very good, suggesting a house red for my friend to start off and a very good beer for myself.  He suggested doing the chefs tasting four courses for 44. We were sold, but he informed us they were out of the infamous pigs head and the beef shin, two dishes we wanted to get. 

Bread was dropped off by the assistant and it was served with pork fat, and my friend really didn't like it. 

Our first course I chose the chip and dip of the day and it was a garlic scape dip served with house made chips. The dip was very good, the only problem with the chips were they broke when dipping them.  My friend ordered the foie gras steamed clams and said he couldn't taste the foie. 

Second course I had the beef tartar and my buddy had the confit chicken wings and he loved them, the beef tartar was very good as well. 

My main was the steak frites cooked a perfect medium rare and my buddy ordered the pork chop and loved it and also ordered animal style frites as a side and his final course.  He said the scrapple really made the dish. 

For dessert I ordered the buttered popcorn pot de creme and it was very delicious, it was a small portion, but after eating all that food it was a welcome site. 

As others have mentioned, order the kitchen coffee, we were the first ones to order it that night and I rang the bell through the dining room and my friend was screaming and when we went down the stairs to the kitchen they were going crazy. Treat your cooks the best!"}
{"text":"its good you got a great chef and some crazy idea's maybe to crazy soemtimes for me but overall a solid cleveland place to eat"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. The food was overpriced and it definitely did not live up to the hype. I started with grilled tomato salad. The dish is literally 4 slices of grilled semi-ripe tomato topped with onion slices and some sauce. I highly recommend against it! I wish I took pictures. Following that, I had a lamb burger with fries. The burger was pretty delicious and juicy. Unfortunately, the fries were topped with unpeeled whole cloves of garlic. Not only was the garlic flavor too strong and the serving style was quite unusual. On the plus side, they are a nice rooftop overlooking E 4th."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night before the Cavaliers playoff game.  It was just short of horrible.  Service was very slow, which we are rather used to here, but the food was downright horrible which came as a shock.  We have eaten here probably a dozen times and have been OK with slow service because we were with friends and having a nice social evening so it wasn't all that noticeable.  However, when the food is horrible, the lousy service becomes very apparent.  

Two items we ordered did not show up until we asked for them (twice)....and it took 15 minutes to make these requests because our sever never came around.  Drinks were empty and all we could do was look around the room and see that hardly anyone had food in front of them.  When our orders did arrive my wife and I had ordered burgers...both were to be medium.  Mine was burnt to a crisp and hers was literally raw (sent that one back and refused to pay).  I had requested vegetables in lieu of frites....to which I was told \"no problem\". Next to my burger were a couple carrots and some celery....uncooked.....like they pulled it off a salad tray and threw them on my plate.  Ridiculous.  Never going back, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Well, $12 for a tiny kale salad with almost no additional elements.  Just kale on a plate.  Go to Trader Joe's and buy a bag for $2.99.  That's what I get for being a vegetarian in Cleveland I suppose. More bang for my buck would be appreciated"}
{"text":"Always a huge fan of this place. Food is really so delicious but a more recent visit wasn't impressed. Had an off experience which I communicated to the restaurant which I and all patrons would think was not cool and have never heard back. I'm a fair honest person so due to the fact they don't care about patron concerns when it comes to their staff and their cleanliness and manner then I'll take my money elsewhere. I'd say they were top Cleveland restaurant but have to move on."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and have always enjoyed the experience. It's a cute place, and the waitstaff is great. If you're ever in the area, you should definitely stop by.

The mussels are fantastic. My party asked for extra bread to sop of all that goodness. The chef's tasting menu is also a great deal, and definitely what I'd recommend if you want to try a bunch of different plates. [If you want the pig head call ahead to make sure they're serving it.] 

From the burgers, to the entrees, I've enjoyed it all. And especially the crispy hominy, and had ground steak tartar. The wings, however, were way too salty for consumption. The staff was great though, and let us switch that out for something else.

They also have a nice selection of specialty cocktails, as well as beer and wine."}
{"text":"Best wings I have ever had! Their bar is great and the people that work there are super friendly!"}
{"text":"My two star rating of this restaurant doesn't mean that the food is not good.  Instead it is suppose to expresses my disappointment after build up in my mind about this gastropub.  I would revisit for a couple of specific dishes however I'm not one to enthusiastically  encourage anyone I know to go.

My date and I went to celebrate her birthday and experience one of East 4ths signature restaurants.  I wanted to get a complete idea of the menu so I ordered the four course chefs tasting menu while she ordered the Whole Grilled Padrón Peppers and the  40 Day Dry Aged Rib Steak Frites.  Since I was driving and she was not we considered ordering a half bottle of wine until we saw the high prices of the wine, ($30+)

They first brought out my Peel & Eat Gulf Shrimp and her Whole Grilled Padrón Peppers. Both were excellent although I felt it was a lot of work to peal and devein the three large, headed shrimp.  The Padrón Peppers were described as 50/50 sweet and hot like a jalapeno but the ones she had while delicious were not hot.

Next they brought my Crispy Chicken Wings Confit which is one of two items that I would go back to get.  The menu said that it's served with roasted jalapeno but I couldn't find or taste any, in fact these wings didn't have any heat what so ever.

The entrees of \"40 Clove\" Heirloom Garlic Roasted  1/2 Chicken and 40 Day Dry Aged Rib Steak Frites.  Presentation was wonderful and worthy of the highest complements.  The taste on the other hand was average at best.  The chicken gives the impression that you'd get chicken roasted with 40 cloves of garlic or some other herb but other than the chicken being served inside brioche bread there was no notable garlic or herb flavor.  The steak was served as a ribeye and a separate braised rib but ended up on the fatty side.

Served with my chicken was the other reason that I'd go back, the Very Very Very Spicy Greens n' Beans.  I'm not considered a greens lover by any stretch but I love these!  The chili paste is balanced against the white beans.

Lastly we split the Cinnamon Roll Warm Bread Pudding with vanila creme anglaise.  What seemed like an excellent concept turned out to be a terrible disappointment.  The bread pudding was more like a dry bread casserole and the the creme anglaise was presented as the dreaded \"spoon push' smear.

I could go on but suffice to say if you want presentation over taste Greenhouse is your kind of choice."}
{"text":"What a unique, creative place - physically and in terms of the menu. I love the seating arrangement. The forward and rear balconies overlooking the main level make for three separate and cozy seating area. The staff is also great. Friendly and really above and beyond excited and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. The food menu is so creative and really the entire menu is made for sharing. My friend and I ordered two entrees and an app and split everything. The lamb burger entree comes with w/ the Pommes Frites which are served with chunks of garlic, seasoned with rosemary and served with a dipping aioli sauce. The burger itself was a bit juicy which made the bun soggy, though the burger was well done. The stinky cheese fondue it is served with....well....it stinks. The sogginess I think can be credited to the tangy yogurt sauce. The other entree we got was the hand ground beef filet of beef tartar. This was previously an app, now it's an entree though definitely not enough to fill you up if it's all you order.  It's served with some stadium mustard and the same aioli that came with the frites both on the side. Perched on top of the meat patty is 1, 3-minute egg. A 3-minute egg I found out is served stood upright, still in the shell with just the top knocked off. The yellow is runny for dipping and the white inside the shell is not 100% solidified either. The meat though however gross you may find the concept of beef tartar was really good! I was pleasantly surprised!! By taste I would say the beef was chilled just below room temperature. It was very flavourful, not chewy and not at all the odd texture I expected. For a first time tartar experience I have to say it was great! The app we got also shocked me! I'm not a wing guy - I never order them in sports bars and generally avoid them. The wings here though were amazing and I might come back just for them. They are called crispy chicken wings confit. The chicken just literally falls right off of the bone better than any wings I've ever eaten before. The dry sauce on the wings is also amazing and if I didn't have to go to a meeting after eating here without the opportunity to stop and use mouth wash before going I would have probably ate it all up: roasted jalapeño, lemon juice, lots of scallion & of course huge garlic pieces. Previous meals I have had here were not as impressive. This was one of the better dinners I have had in a long time, here or elsewhere."}
{"text":"we ate there a couple weeks ago.  We went on a Sunday evening.  No problem getting a table.  The service was good.  The food was okay.  I will not return.  I am not really into the over fancy presentation and preparation of food.  I was thinking it was going to be more like  a tavern.  My guest was not overly impressed either.  

However, if you like a cool setting and fancy food, this is the place for you to try.  I wish them nothing but luck and prosperity."}
{"text":"What a HUGE HUGE let down.....Service was not good.  Food was Not Good.

We left wishing we would have gone anywhere but here!

An entree came out FROZEN in the center....Begged to get it sent back, and then was brought a piece of CHARD BLACK food, which was not eaten.  Entree was not even offered to be removed from the bill.  Everyone there acted like it was a chore to wait on our table.  We wont waste our time going back here.  The bar and atmosphere are very fun and cool, kind of a shame.

Hamburger is also overrated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink and ended up ordering the clams and a dessert.  The clams were brothy and flavorful and the popcorn pot de creme was to die for!  I am waiting for the day to come back to get the pig's head!"}
{"text":"Never understood why the place was the way it is. Very pretentious, very hipster, very trendy. Upon meeting Jonathan sawyer I understand. Honestly speaking, not worth the money unless it's happy hour. More of a bragging point to say you ate there."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, yet very heavy.  Had the clams, gnocchi, fish.  Wish I could have tried the Flintstone ribs but I can tell that would have been too much food. They should put more food on the kid's meals.  My daughter had to eat half of my dish to be satisfied, but thank goodness, it was all so heavy except for the fish which could have been a larger portion.  Portions are a bit out of whack depending on what you get.  I respect the sustainable ingredients and use of the whole animal but it can't be bad when you have pork!"}
{"text":"Favorite place on E.4th hands down! The Fred Flintstone plate of ribs was AMAZING! The chicken wings fall off the bone like butter! The roof top bar has a nice get-away feel to it and lets you feel like you are somewhere else for a few minutes! Wonderful cocktails and knowledgeable bartenders!"}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to eating here. Heard good things about it. Our waiter was outstanding and that it is the only thing that I can say that was up to par tonight. Oh & the wine. My husband ordered the pig ears to be adventuresome..favorable but way too many.for an appetizer. I ordered the market fish... Alaskan Halibut, was to be 8oz according to our waiter, could not have been 4oz. No peas with it as mentioned in the menu, but instead one-sliced radish & 4 roasted asparagus, some greens & 5 of the chewiest gnocchi I've ever tasted. Good broth but for about $37 way overpriced. My hubby had a NY Strip with a big piece of gristle in it. French Fries were very good. But at $34 again the cut of meat was not up to par. Will we go back not sure, there are so many other excellent restaurants to chose from."}
{"text":"I usually _NEVER_ complain about small portion sizes - but when they are mediocre in taste, and astronomical in price (16 dollars for an overly salty ladle of Gnochi) - brings much dissapointment in the experience.  A prior review sums it up perfectly: \"Insanely over priced, underwhelming food and really sub par service. I really wanted to like this place!\"  

The place looks awesome, has a great vibe, but the food is so underwhelming it offers  a glimpse of what this restaurant probably used to be in the past (well crafted tasting dishes) and now feels like they are just cranking out plates of mediocre food - riding coat tails of what was probably once a great restaurant.  Planning to not return."}
{"text":"Good food, cool/interesting ambience, the Brussels sprouts are delicious and the waitress was attentive and even charged my phone for me."}
{"text":"For a special evening (Anniversary #32) decided to return to GHT once again. Got in before our reservation time, placed my cell with hostess for a call for an outdoor table and ventured out on E4th. Didn't get but 20 steps and here's my text saying table is ready. Perfect timing.

After being taken to our table, the waiter came over and took our drink order. Prior to leaving to return with the drinks, he was asked about his favorites. And of course he mentioned the favorite of many, the \"Crispy chicken wings confits\" So we started the evening off with that dish. What a delight! Tender wings that nearly fell off and made my wife happy that I wouldn't eat these wings, like I do at other places (leave it to you to visualize that!)  Highly recommended and you would be remorseful if you DID NOT order this dish.

For the main course, my wife ordered the Strip steak and I was set for the Lamb burger.  Both were served with the Greenhouse fries! The steak, according to my wife, was cooked exactly as she wanted it, medium, light pink coloring. Perfect and as she carved her way around the dish, I could see she was really surprised!  Normally she would have a hard time finishing about half of the dish, but she had no problem and knew she would have a great meal afterwards.

My choice of the lamb burger was beyond my expectations! Thick, grilled perfectly and no way you could tell it was lamb (if you were concerned of the lamb taste). A tasty pattie served on a warm roll that was delicious! (I could eat the bun alone...it is that good) My dish to came with the fries. Let me say the fries were near the top of my favorites list. Numerous garlic cloves and sprigs of rosemary mixed in made a supper side. Actually I could go for the wings and fries as a meal and would not be disappointed!

On an mid-week evening, you cannot go wrong with one of Cleveland's top Chef's restaurant, The Greenhouse Tavern.  If you haven't stopped in, you are missing a gem on E4th!  Send your self a text or email to place this on your up-coming calendar! Not this month tho, since the republicans will be taking over C'Town later, but after the visitor's have gone, be a visitor yourself. Mark my words, you won't be anything but pleased!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and usually enjoy the service and food.  However, last night we sat at the bar and couldn't get service.!   The bar was full but not crowded.  There were 3 bartenders and 2 of them were only making drinks for the tables.  The couple next to us had empty drinks and we waited for over 10 minutes without even receiving the menus or water or a \"we'll be right with you.\"  We left.  There are so many other good options in Cleveland that I would hesitate to go back again."}
{"text":"Great everything, eat wings, and all other food, buy drinks, then you will want to come back ASAP."}
{"text":"The Greenhouse Tavern is fantastic. From lunch to brunch to dinner to the late night menu....the service, the cocktails. Their bourbon menu is fantastic and the foie gras steamed clams, pimento cheese & the fries are all must haves. If you're lucky enough to get a seat in Kevin's section, you'll have the best dining experience of your life.  Throw a few pickleback shots back and enjoy the atmosphere. The Greenhouse Tavern ROCKS. I've eaten out all over the world and The Greenhouse Tavern is one of my all time faves!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant about 5 times since it opened. Each time, great service, and amazing food. Great menu, great ambiance.  The only thing I've ever had there that was sub-par was the salmon (kind of overcooked and bland, tho the broth it was served in was nice). 
Highly recommended. And if you like fries - these are a MUST try."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant in the past and the food and service have always been decent but when I was there this past Saturday I had a very different experience. 
I was in a large party of about 20 people and we were seated at two tables and each had our own server. Each of them was very friendly and did a good job with drinks and clearing dishes. But our table ordered our food first. The other table ordered about 10 minutes afterwards. The other table finally got their food about 45 minutes later and our tables food was another 20 minutes. One of the meals at our table either wasn't put in by the server or missed by the kitchen. No one ever explained so we are still left wondering. The manager finally brought it out about 15 minutes later without an explanation, apology or offer to make it right. I was in the restaurant business for a number of years at a chain restaurant and even I know that is unacceptable. All of the food tasted ok but the slow food service eclipsed anything else. Now I'm not expecting a free meal for the party here or anything but the party member that had to wait 90 minutes for a medium cheeseburger is just ridiculous and her dinner should have been comp'd. I will never take a party to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Get the confit chicken wing appetizers, they're great! Burger was not bad. Steaks are solid!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for dinner and always had a great meal and good experience. However, I was quite disappointed in my latest dining experience for a Saturday brunch last week. We went with another couple, who ordered the pancakes and chicken & waffles, while my husband and I ordered the pastrami hash and classic benedict. There was something burnt in 3 of the 4 dishes! One of the pancakes on my friend's plate was completely black... They even tried to hide it by putting it in the bottom of the stack, but you can't hide a black pancake! My husband's classic benedict also had one of the English muffins burnt! As for my pastrami hash, it came with a charred piece of toast, but that I could care less about. I was overall not impressed with my dish. The pastrami lacked any real flavor, so much so that I couldn't even tell the difference from when I was eating meat or potatoes... It all tasted the same!

From this experience, I would not return back here for brunch. However, they got 3 stars because of the few times I have come for dinner in the past and enjoyed my meal (if you're into sharing, I would definitely recommend either the short rib or the pig's head. Be aware that the pig's head is not for the weak palette, you have to be comfortable with and enjoy fatty meats)."}
{"text":"Love it!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at the restaurant, the hostess told me they had no record of my Open Table reservation, which was embarrassing in light of the fact that I was accompanied by a business client. The hostess did find us a table quickly, but it was a high-top bar table in a rather cramped space at the front window. My kale salad was tasty until about midway through, when I bit into some some nasty grit. At an expensive place like this, you'd think they'd wash their greens carefully. My entree, a vegan pasta dish, was tasty, but my client was served meager portions of an appetizer (three \"tater tots\") and entree (a lonely chicken drumstick). Service was attentive and friendly, but the room was loud. I will not feel compelled to return."}
{"text":"This place fires on all cylinders...the staff is great, the vibe is perfect, and the food will encourage you to overeat.  (Literally. It's served on pig-shaped plates!)

2 visits in one week's time, and the experience was consistently 5-star all the way.

The food is superb; simpler, more economical entrees like the lamb burger are of equal quality to higher-priced items like the mushroom risotto.

The differentiators at Greenhouse Tavern, aside from exceptional food, are impeccable service and a delightful, comfortable atmosphere.

Worth.  Every.  Penny."}
{"text":"We sat outside and loved the people-watching on 4th street. Our server, Brittany, was attentive and helpful. The food took a little longer than expected to come out but it was not to the point of annoyance. 

Our top three favorite items in order were the 
1. The horchata drink - tiny but so good that I had two 
2. the delicious veggie burger - one of the best veggie burgers I've had in a while. The buns were thick and tasty and the burger itself had so much flavor (esp with the garlic aioli we got with the fired)
3. The pea crostini - definitely on the small side though with only three little pieces of crostini

The brussel sprouts were pretty average. 
We Didn't love the vegan BBQ. It was a hodgepodge of random items that didn't really fit together. It had pickles, onion rings, smoky shallots (delish), green bean casserole, white bread, and BBQ mushrooms. The BBQ mushrooms were definitely the least appealing of the selection, but we liked the pickles and the shallots.

For dessert we got the boca negra which was ok. The chocolate cake wasn't as rich as it looked. 

Would definitely go back for that veggie burger and horchata drink!"}
{"text":"Those of you who know me will find this as no big surprise but Greenhouse Tavern is to me, the best restaurant in Cleveland. I tend to dine there at least once a week and so I feel very qualified not only to speak to the quality of the food but also the consistency.  

Chef Sawyer believes strongly in sourcing as much of their ingredients locally as possible and as a result butchers their animals in-house as much as possible.  Due to these philosophies their menu changes fairly frequently a few items at a time based on the availability of certain items.  Large menu changes occur usually around the change in the seasons.  The last thing to remember about the menu is that it is French inspired so while it may sound intimidating upon first glance, don't let that scare you away.  

As you may have learned from reading my other reviews I'm a very adventurous eater. I have yet to find something on a menu that would scare most people out the door, that I wouldn't be willing to try.  How does this relate to Greenhouse?  In their quest to use as much of the animal as possible they end up with some very creative, tasty dishes. While there isn't typically anything on the menu at first glance that may scare you away except for pig's head there is a hidden treasure amongst the deliciousness that many don't even notice. That item is the \"Fifth Quarter\" changing just about daily, this is my favorite menu item and a large reason that Greenhouse is my favorite restaurant.  You may ask, how can it be your favorite dish if it changes daily?  The fact that it changes and is always something new, creative and delicious available makes it a perfect choice for me.  So what exactly is the fifth quarter? It is traditionally offal that is kept by the butcher to cook at home.  I've had everything from beef or pork tongue, to chicken necks and Ox heart.  All of which you would surely find delicious if you didn't know what it was ahead of time.

I could go on about everything I've had at Greenhouse but considering I virtually try every menu item at every change of the menu I could write a book.  Instead I'll hit up the staples that typically don't change a whole lot.  

First I'll start with.....Starters, after all it is the logical place to start right? Foie Gras Steamed Clams and Devils on Horseback (Bacon wrapped and chocolate stuffed dates) are always fan favorites of not just myself but all those I know who have gone. The salads are always very fresh and delicious. The taste makes it evident that the ingredients didn't have to travel far to get to your plate.  

Time for the entrees.  While there is sometimes a pasta on other parts of the menu, such as seconds all of the pastas I've had are excellent, try them. You may not think of it as a place to get great pasta, but I've had some of the best pasta dishes EVER here, don't discount that. The roasted half chicken is a very popular item but \"buyer beware\" the thing is huge, it could easily be shared between two people, it is unlike any roasted chicken you will ever have.  The Pig's head is another great choice. Don't think pig's head though. Think the most tender, juicy pulled pork of your life.  That's basically what we are talking about here.  If you are in the mood to splurge and it is still on the menu (it is a fairly new item not sure if it will change or not yet) you must try the 40 Day Dry Aged Steak Frites. This is the Certified Angus Beef from Niman Ranch, super tender and flavorful but don't bother if you are going to order it any more done than medium, you are just wasting your money. (I feel that way about any steak, order something else before you order it medium well or well.)

Another can't miss item that is great to share with your meal or as something to munch on over a few drinks is the Frites aka French Fries. Whether you get the ones with garlic and rosemary, which are great, or go all out for the Animal Style Frites, complete with fried egg, cheese curd, gravy, whole grain mustard, fried eggs and bacon, you'll leave a happy man or woman, guaranteed. 

As for desserts, there is always a Jeni's ice cream flavor which if you've never tried Jeni's Ice Cream out of Columbus, OH it is a great choice.  The dessert menu changes as frequently as the dinner menu so the current item that I'm in love with is the Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding. I typically am not a huge bread pudding fan and I LOVE this. So if you are a fan of bread pudding there probably isn't much more I need to say about it.

If you haven't been to Greenhouse Tavern, you must try it. The staff is always very friendly, the bartenders make great classic and creative drinks."}
{"text":"4.5 *, but you know me and my cherished 5*'s... not quite there.  OK... I apologize in advance, because this is probably the worst Yelp review I'm ever writing, with respect to actual details.

I ate here 1-2 years ago, and I absolutely loved the food.  I know we got the wings, which were crispy and amazing.  I know we wanted to get the pig face, but opted for some of the other amazing sounding menu items.  I can't remember what we settled on, but there were soo many good options.

I have no clue what we got, it was too long ago.  But we left extremely satisfied, with full tummies, and I hate myself for not having written this review promptly, to do this place justice.  But go... explore the menu.. you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Crispy Chicken Wings Confit w/ roasted jalapeño, lemon juice, scallions & garlic were the best wings I've ever had. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I can't imagine why anyone would ever give this place less than a five. Definitely one of, if not, the best restaurant in CLE. 

Sit at the bar. It's meant to be eaten at, with its giant depth that easily hosts several plates that can be eaten from without getting cramped. You'll be entertained by the giant screen playing one of hundreds of VHS tapes. And served by friendly, knowledgable bartenders with expert timing.

The crispy confit wings bursted with flavor and spice, and were just right flavor-wise. And we got a TON of them. GHT frites are my all-time favorite, and I have in fact had frites in Paris. Topped all of them. (And by the way: the garlic peels are no accident, don't be so prissy about having to pick them out). Our beef pot au feu was not what we expected... More like corned beef and cabbage in a savory consume, but it was delicious. Dessert was a glorious Opera Torte. 

My house wine, Pimms cup, and the sangria-like concoction of bourbon, ruby port, and gran marnier were all incredible.

Basically, you can order literally anything here and it will be the best. The prices make it something I have to save up for to enjoy, but you absolutely get what you pay for, and then some."}
{"text":"FINALLY got to eat a regular meal here. For a Saturday night it wasn't packed full like some of the other 4th St restaurants but it made for a nice comfortable ambiance to talk with fellow diners. The server was great but now on with the food...

Appetizers: Gravy Frites (basically poutine if you've ever been to Canada) and Chicken Wings. They didn't disappoint. Chicken wings were probably some of the best of the two.

Entrees: For the season they had a special half roast chicken and truffles in bread that was going to take 40 minutes so we ordered it right away and ordered two more entrees to split between the four of us -- Sea Bass and Pork Saltimbocca. The pork was awesome and was the first thing done on the table. The fish was so-so and anti-climatic from the description. The highly anticipated chicken and truffles was such a disappointment, bland and forgetable. I think it would have been ok if the chicken dish wasn't $40.

In the end it was an ok meal, I will probably come back to give it another chance because there were some good dishes and I love the intent of the restaurant--I just want food to match the hype. So go, but choose wisely."}
{"text":"The lamburger was awesome, the Kale salad was too! The gnocchi was unique and excellent as well!"}
{"text":"One of my fav spots in downtown CLE! Their chicken wings are incredible...so juicy yet crispy. They seriously fall right off the bone. And their lamb burger is one of my personal favs! 
Also I highly recommend their brunch. Their bloody Mary's are on point and their menu has a unique twist on brunch. Seriously delicious."}
{"text":"GHT has it all! Great food, incredible service and a great vibe. Was there last night for dinner with 14 friends and family! This is a true gem in CLE and should always be on anyone's short list for a local or anyone visiting our fine city! Cheers Team Sawyer!"}
{"text":"I've been to Greenhouse Tavern numerous times since my original review-visited the rooftop bar, eaten at the main floor bar and sat down for dinner at a table. Each time they've earned their stars. The service has been friendly and the staff is always willing to offer food and drink recommendations. 

The food also stands the test. My favorites are the pomme frites served with aioli and the fall-off-the-bone chicken wings with scallions and lemon. Last time there, I tried the \"Properly butchered rib steak,\" served with dauphenoise potatoes. It was large and very rich, but delicious. I almost always end with the maple walnut brittle ice cream. It's made by Columbus-based Jeni's Ice Cream and made exclusively for Greenhouse. 

Definitely a must-eat if you're looking for a good place on in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing food. Had the wings and they didn't taste very fresh and were very salty. The brussels sprouts I got were salted and charred beyond any recognition. My wife had the stuffed cabbage which she enjoyed. We also had the gravy frites. The gravy had a chocolate flavor and surprisingly the fries could have used some salt. It wasn't the worst food but for the price, I'll definitely skip this place next time. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Chef seems to not understand the general difference between pasta and gnocchi."}
{"text":"Excellent service, truly creative dishes and a great atmosphere.

If you like food as art, this is your spot in Cleveland. There are no words to describe how delicious and interesting everything here is! 

My voyeuristic tendencies were entertained by being able to check out the sexy kitchen staff as they work downstairs. The entire outfit is run like a well oiled machine.  Be sure to buy them a round of Black Labels if you are pleased with your meal...  

Just open your mind and do not be afraid to try something new! All my dude friends in LA still pine over the \"Pig Head\" dinner they had there. For me, that damn bread platter; (as basic as it is) is just the ideal comfort. I know, the wings are amazeballs too. 

The pricing is also great. In LA, people would charge an arm and a leg for the same meal. In CLE, it is affordable to the mere mortal. I dream of eating at Greenhouse regularly. Props!"}
{"text":"With a broken arm, the pork was succulent enough to cut with a fork and the waiter felt bad for me and gave me a comp salty Carmel brulet.  So good!  5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Very fun location! We were there on a Monday and took advantage of the weekly pig roast!! It was a delicious plate. We also ordered the bean and rice burger which was a bit big but really good. The brussel sprouts were a good side dish. My favorite part was dessert...the pressed coffee is wonderful alongside the pot de creme with salted caramel. To was one of the best desserts I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Thank god this place was still open and thank god this place had amazing food. So i got into cleveland kinda late on a sun and pretty much everything was closed except this place and let me tell you thank you for all the other places being closed. Started off with the house salad... disappointing; than i got the bread platter with 6 different types of spread.... disappointing; but wait theres more, than things took a turn for the better i got the foie gras clams... oh my god Perfect!!  than came the beef tar tar and well i killed te whole plate, than came the main course the lamb burger... whatever that sauce is if you put it on crap id probably still eat it, thats how i would describe it that amazing. Overall this place is great, def a lot of carbs though, bread lots of it and fries endless amount of fries! but im a fan. The staff was great very fast and helpful and ill def come back when im in cleveland!"}
{"text":"Just didn't live up to the hype!  I'd been reading about this place for weeks before our upcoming trip to Cleveland and was anticipating great things.  We got talked into to trying the \"5 Course Chef's Tasting Menu.\"  We were told the portion sizes were identical  to their normal, non-tasting menu counterparts. Well if she didn't lie to us, then I feel horrible for the person that paid $26 for the rabbit ragu. The portions were obviously tasting portions. With that said, the food was great. Atmosphere was awesome. The drink menu focused more on wines than beer, which was a bit surprising. All in all, I would go back."}
{"text":"So, maybe this is the case where you read all sorts of great reviews and then it doesn't live up to the hype. I just wasn't that impressed. 

We go out every year for Christmas with a few friends, so this year we chose The Greenhouse Tavern. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated all the way upstairs. Table was nice. 
Or server did his best. When we first sat down he went thorough this speech about the menu. It took about 15 minutes. I realized that this is what they require the servers to do as we saw other servers doing the same, but\ yikes, that was overwhelming and not really helpful. 

At first he told us they were out of the duck and bread board and then proceeded to talk up the \"Flintstone\". After we finally figured out what we wanted, he came back to tell us that they were out of the \"Flintstone\". They were also out of two or three of the drinks we ordered. How do you run out of alcohol on a Saturday night in the winter? 

My husband and I decided the tasting menu would be too much, so we ordered two seconds and two thirds. I also shared some gravy frites with the rest of the table. 
Chicken Wings - 7 to the plate. Really nice flavor. A bit salty, but it was really good. 
Garlic Stuffed Semolina Pasta- literally there were three tiny little ravioli, 2.5-3 bites, tasted good, but not enough on the plate. 
Gravy Frites- seriously, how can these be bad?
Strip Steak - Cooked nicely, big portion. Served with a perfect garlic aioli. 

I don't eat pork which limited the menu a bit. A friend of mine ordered the pig face. He got the last one in the house for the night. He said it was good, but it wasn't so pretty to look at, for me at least. 

Overall, the food that we had was good. The star was the chicken wings. I wish they would have had some of the stuff they were out of, as I really wanted to try the duck or the ribs. 

2.5 stars."}
{"text":"That Philles Outfielder, Jay Johnston, got it wrong when he said, \"I went through Cleveland once and it was closed.\" At least I doubt he'd say that these days. 

I had several great meals in downtown Cleveland last week but my favorite was here at the Greenhouse Tavern. 

Started off with their homemade white fromage (cheese) and olives. Tried their (not) pork belly w/rooms appetizer. Then I went crazy over their steak frites and my colleague loved the spaghetti squash with garbonzo beans with light curry and tumeric seasoning. We paired it all with a 3-blend Tuscan wine that was quite nice. Price for the quality of meal and service was right in line with what I'd expect.

Server, Natalie I think, was super and I stopped by the back room to chat for a moment with chef Jonathan, laying serious praise on the entrees and appetizers. He brushed off the appetizer, \"How can you not like pork and mushrooms?\" Maybe so, but I still think this place has it going well. 

I'm told they've been open since March, which is not long to them - about half a career by Dallas restaurant standards. I'm going back next time I'm in the city, if for no reason other than to prove those dang Philly ballplayers wrong."}
{"text":"The service was great. We ordered Market Fish, Hamburger, and Fried Brussels. They were delicious but too salty for our tastes. In fact, I had to have the fish returned to the kitchen. They gave us a take out replacement of the same dish (Grouper) and didn't charge us which is very professional of them."}
{"text":"I was lured here mainly by the fred flintstone beef short rib platter because it looked crazy and I really had to try it. Other people had told me good things about Greenhouse also. More pricey than my normal dinners but a good splurge is fine every now and then. We had a double date and ordered the amount of dishes recommended but the flintstone really was the one worth waiting for.

Upon walking in I loved how friendly the hostess and server was. Explained everything in detail and was so sweet about everything. The decor and ambience felt like an open gastropub and the vintage rusty bikes hanging above made it feel like a hipster joint. I wouldn't call myself a hipster but I didn't mind it. The bikes were fun even though I couldn't figure out the reason for the numbers on them! Service through the night was on point and I can't fault her for anything. 

FOIE GRAS STEAMED CLAMS
Have no idea where the foie gras was in this dish. I was excited to order this since foie gras was banned in LA and as soon as I saw that I knew this was a dish I had to try.

TWICE COOKED FORAGED MUSHROOMS
Delicious and I could've licked up the sauce. 

CARROT TATER TOTS
Yummy...but I only got one since there were only 6 of these. More please...

CLEVELAND GREEN HOUSE SALAD
I enjoyed this salad a lot and even the bleu cheese. Hah and usually I don't like bleu cheese much at all. Weirdly enough this was the largest portion of the seconds and thirds other than the flintstone.

FRED FLINTSTONE BEEF SHORT RIB
This thing was absolutely insane. It takes an hour for this to cook but it was worth the wait. It comes with some veggies and mashed potatoes and a huge rib. Pretty good even though some of the meat was a bit dry.

Overall many of the dishes were great in flavor, but fell short in portion vs price. The only thing that was large in size was the flintstone platter. Everything else we had was sized so small that we were left with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I've been to many restaurants of this price point and style and generally the portions sizes are smaller but not dainty. 

Flavor wise and style overall is pretty good, but beware for your wallet!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to go here ever since I heard about the fact that it was joining the already-stellar lineup of restaurants on East 4th. Yes, that was several years ago. And yes, I have read many, many laudatory reviews, both online and in print, and heard several great firsthand accounts by friends and acquaintances who have dined there as well.

Needless to say, by the time I left the freezing, windswept landscape of East 4th and passed through the front door, I had high hopes. Part of me was almost sure that I would leave slightly let down...I thought that there was no way that this place would live up to the collective adulation. 

It did.

First of all, our service was impeccable. Service at upscale restaurants tends to fit into one of two categories--friendly, concerned, ready-to-please servers who are willing to answer any and all questions about the food on the menu, and snotty, withdrawn servers who think they're too good to deign to the unrefined palates of most diners. Fortunately, we did not receive the latter at The Greenhouse Tavern. I postponed the reservation once and then we still showed up late because Greater Cleveland suddenly remembered that we had a thriving downtown area and descended en masse on downtown for the lighting ceremonies downtown, the snow event at Progressive Field, and the Cavs game all at once, which meant that we had problems finding parking. Did we get shoved in the corner? Nope. We got a table on the edge of the second floor of the restaurant with an absolutely spectacular view. Our server was friendly and informative and he answered all of our questions about the food; it was probably the best service I've received since I dined at Emeril's Restaurant over 2 years ago.

Onto the food! We ordered a variety of items. I insisted that we order the frites and the chicken wings, because those were the dishes that most people had said were good. Sheila F. wanted the Bear Claw, so we ordered that as well. We wound up ordering the BOB Frites. As it turned out, I went crazy over the chicken wings and Sheila F. felt the same about the Bear Claw, so I let her have the whole thing in exchange for being able to eat the vast majority of the wings. Fair exchange of you ask me! The wings were perfect--I loved the breading, which had the perfect amount of salt. However, the flavor was accentuated when I scooped up some of the jalapeno, garlic, and scallion topping and ate it right before I bit into the wing! The meat fell right off the bone and the entire dish was superb. The BOB Frites were great as well, especially the parts that were covered by the egg. I'd like to try some of the other frites sometime too!  I was impressed with the portion sizes, as well--sometimes fancy places tend to be skimp a bit...but that wasn't the case here!

I didn't want to spend a lot on a beer, and when I saw the 24 ounce Genny Cream Ale on the menu for $3, I was thrilled. One of the individuals with whom I dined ordered a mixed drink called a Pimm's Cup, and she enjoyed the unique way in which it was made.

Of course, I dig the \"green\" aspect of the entire restaurant and the way they attempt to be sustainable in all of their operations. I am impressed by the fact that they're not satisfied with their current efforts and are striving to be even more eco-friendly and sustainable. That fact alone makes this restaurant worth patronizing--establishments who are working to advance a cause greater themselves deserve praise, and more importantly, a steady stream of business to ensure that they remain open far in the future.

I can't wait to go back here again and try the many other interesting and unique dishes on the menu! The Greenhouse Tavern definitely deserves all of the awards and praises that it has garnered, and I look forward to continued praise and exposure for this outstanding establishment."}
{"text":"Came here on a date.

Here's the downside of this place: my date has a mushroom allergy. Which eliminated damn near the entire menu. You can't eat a mushroom sauce and give a kiss to a woman with a mushroom allergy. You just can't.

What we were able to order, mind you, was tasty. From the drinks, to dinner, to dessert. Buttered Popcorn Pot de Crème? DELICIOUS. The service was a little spotty (water ran dry, drinks were empty...) but overall, we enjoyed it (and it was a short walk from the hotel).

I don't come to Cleveland often, but I would like to return in the future."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  I would describe it as dirty hipster 

Service: Very good A+ 

Food: I got the Lumachi pasta and shared the Gravy Frites. Gravy frites is exactly like poutine and it tasted like other poutine. I ordered the Lumanchi pasta right after I saw \"XO sauce\" I was expecting it to be spicy but it tasted more like bacon flavor pasta and kind of heavy. 

Overall, the food is OK."}
{"text":"While the ambiance and charm of the restaurant was nice, the food didn't pair so well. I ordered some wings and they were not like I expected them to be. The server was very nice and understood. I ended up only eating their original flavored fries and left. Good restaurant if you're looking for food that is gluten free."}
{"text":"I truly believe that this was a fluke and I do plan on returning.  

Pros:    Good music, great atmosphere, friendly hostess, awesome server

Cons:   -Chicken wings covered in garlic peels, from small bits to literally the root 
              ball. After picking out all the garlic peels, which covered a side plate, I ate my  
              cold wings which were seasoned very well.
              -The fries, also containing copious amounts of raw garlic peels where simply
              topped with a long stem of rosemary. And were so heavily salted that they 
              were completely inedible."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now since November, and good lord, it's amazing.

I love the casual, warm environment. The music playing overhead is always good (we heard a song by Titus Andronicus on our last visit--MAJOR points on that one).

Every dish I have tried here has been perfectly seasoned, perfectly prepared, and just...perfect. The Steak Frites is to die for. The steak melts in your mouth, and good lord, the fries?! Fresh cloves of garlic and sprigs of rosemary throughout the fries just make my mouth dance.

Jonathan Sawyer is a beast in the kitchen, and I am so glad that Greenhouse Tavern is there to rock my tastebuds before I go to House of Blues and get my rock on :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. I have had mixed service, sometimes very slow example a 2 hour wait on food or neglecting to put in order, then sometimes on point. The food tastes great, if only more portions on the specialty items. Over all great time, and I will return."}
{"text":"The staff was great at accommodating 20 of us to have dinner together! I got the burger and it was a little on the greasy side and definitely cooked well instead of medium. I got their infamous popcorn dessert and it was everything I heard! The key is to make sure you get all the layers in each bite! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is just plain awesome.  Love the eclectic decor, the chill vibe, and the amazing food.  I went back to Greenhouse Tavern this week and loved it.  The burger continues to be the best I've ever had, and those fries are addictive.  I love that they are not coated in fat and the rosemary adds a ton a flavor!

One colleague ordered the black bean burger, which was a bit surprising--the inside was pink, just like you'd expect from the burger.  However, she said it was delicious.  The second colleague had a regular burger and the two of them shared a kale salad.  Great food, combined with a glass of wine for each of us, was a winning combination.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I dined at Greenhouse Tavern while in Cleveland for a wedding. I had high expectations as everyone told me how good it was when I asked for recommendations. We started with the asparagus starter. I wish we had seen it before we ordered because we would not have ordered 6 pieces of asparagus for $12. While it was ok, it was definitely a rip off. I had the strip steak and frites. While the steak had good flavor, it was fattier than a strip steak should be. The fries were good and plentiful. My boyfriend had the pork chop. He thought the pork chop was just ok, but loved the loin that came with it. We both agreed it was the highlight of the meal.

The restaurant is different and cute. Make sure you check out the rooftop. Our server was attentive and friendly and helped us choose good drinks for our meal. I would definitely go back for drinks on the rooftop if I was in town again, but I would probably eat dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent my husband and I shared the 60 dollar steak it was the perfect portion for two.  The food is fresh and I have never had such good fries they were amazing I would definitely go back"}
