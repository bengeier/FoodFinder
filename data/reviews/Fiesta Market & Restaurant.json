{"text":"The staff are friendly and very helpful. The veggie selection is ok but like most places in Calgary very carne oriented. That said, the food is truly yummy and very authentic Mexican food. I enjoy every morsel and frequent the place after a very crazy and long workout at the gym (need the veggie protein to help with recovery ). Fiesta has a market at the back too. Great place to restock one's pantry and get hot sauce, tortillas etc. -- The place is typically packed so you may run into the rest of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"More great food in the Deep South. Raj Palace, Moon and now Fiesta, Midnapore is becoming a foody haven!  Awesome fresh food, very friendly staff and reasonable prices. Will be in our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Fresh authentic Mexican food! I can never get enough or it. Portions are big and delicious. I highly recommend this casual Mexican Joint! They also have a few kid friendly kid items."}
{"text":"Just had my first taste of Fiesta's delicious Mexican food. Everything is so fresh and tasty, and there are a LOT of options. Lots of take-out options, and there are some great pantry options in the market at the back. I will be going back soon, and only wish I could get delivery! I'd never cook for myself again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and authentic Mexican food at this cute, cheery quick-service restaurant!  Really nice and friendly staff enhance the experience, but the food is what earned all 5 stars.  A simple but varied and reasonably priced menu is freshly prepared and super flavourful. 
 Plenty of vegetarian options, much appreciated. Salsa bar is a bonus!  Plus, their pantry and refrigerated items are very tempting for cooking adventures.  Will definitely return regularly!"}
{"text":"Awesome mexican food! Staff is very helpful and service is excellent! Been back many times and rave about the place to everyone."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Love the Mexican market in the back as well. Able to get some really neat food to take home and make. Like that I can get small serving sizes which is perfect for me. If you like authentic Mexican food, you must try this place out!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely outstanding. I've been a few times now and have tried the fish tacos, tortilla soup and today the Menodo. This is the real deal treat your family to a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"A great Mexican restaurant in the deep south? No. Can't be. Really? Really! I have been here a bunch of times now and have tried pretty much everything. My goto now is the incredible home made chips to start with the habanero salsa, tortilla soup and the meat lovers gordita. All for about $11 and change. Just wish they had something better for the salsa than the tiny plastic cups.

They also have a market area in the back with some great latino products. This place and Unimarket are giving Calgary some credibility when it comes to Mexican food, finally."}
{"text":"I loved having lunch here. There are about 8 to 10 tables that begin in the front of the restaurant where you order piping hot delicious Mexican food all the way to the back where you can buy Mexican seasonings and pantry items. 

The staff here is very nice and the food is awesome. I've eaten at other Mexican restaurants around town and sometimes my stomach would hurt after or I won't feel very good but none of that happened here. It was good clean fresh tacos, tortilla soup, fresh meat; all seasoned to perfection. 

I'm so happy that this place exists. It's definitely worth a visit. Tortilla soup was one of the best I had ever tasted.

The atmosphere here is casual, comfortable and relaxed. They have a number of Mexican desserts available as well as daily specials. Visit this restaurant if you love Mexican food."}
{"text":"Just like home! Ordered the sopes and they have all the fixins you need that you can help yourself to."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT. 
Simple set up: You order at the counter, have a seat, they call your order, you crush some of the best Mexican food you can find in Calgary.
Actually Mexican too. As in they ARE from Mexico originally.
Jessica said, \"The jamaica reminds me of what it tasted like at my grandma's house.\"
The food is great. Generally choices of gorditas (a little stuffed taco) or tacos with a variety of fillings (mostly meats) to choose from; $3.50 each. They also have a daily special (I think usually for $10). We went on Tuesday for enchiladas. Super good.
The tortillas are made in-house and are so fresh they roll off the press before your very eyes.
Sopa Azteca (tortilla soup) was really good too. Rich broth, deep in flavour.
Desert (tres leches cake) is yummy too.
The cherry on top is the little store they have at the back. They have most Mexican products and goodies you can think of. All fairly priced.
Please support this place. It is a gem for the neigbourhood and a one-of-a-kind place for Calgary."}
