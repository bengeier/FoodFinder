{"text":"Whether or not you understand the bohemian/New Age theme of this store, I'd just like to draw attention to their crystal infused tea, which contains an awesome blend of organic and wild harvested herbs and roots (and for the one I bought, contained  something called chaga mushroom). I bought the Medi-TEA-tion today after being offered a sample of another tea by a very sweet gentleman. Omg it tastes so good, both strong and soothing. Reminds me of herbal tea sometimes offered at yoga studios...but better! $15 including tax for 50 grams! Oh and don't be a noob and try to steep the crystal AND the tea leaves..."}
{"text":"Great little New Age shop! I was looking for a large crystal, and they didn't have many crystals in a large size, which was a bummer. But they did have a great selection of small crystals and stones. PLUS a great selection of Oracle and Tarot Cards! Lots to look at in here. A real \"gem\" in the middle of Kensington Market!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in it was unlike any other crystal store I've been to, and by far my favourite one yet. I loved everything about this store, the crystals, the people, the energy, the tea, the classes! This place was just amazing in every way and the people who work here were very helpful & friendly!"}
{"text":"This small shop/cafe is fascinating. It has a wide array of crystals - so many in fact, that they are arranged in different corners of the store. There is also handmade jewelry and some oracle cards and books, and a lot of 'superteas' (tea blends) and chaga mushrooms. The most interesting part for me was that you can buy tea and other drinks to go. The lady at the counter gave us two generous servings of a delicious iced rooibos tea. Definitely worth a peak if you're interested in crystal therapy, tea or any psychic or meditation practice."}
{"text":"This is a neat bohemian little spot, that just opened up in the neighbourhood.  They have a great selection of loose leaf teas, and it's a great place to grab a delicious tea to go! You can sit down and have a glass or pot of tea too, which is wonderful since they have free wi-fi access.  They also sell the tea in small samples so you can figure out what you like.

The shop is full of hand crafted jewelry, crystals and artwork.  The people who work here are friendly and fun.  A groovy getaway."}
{"text":"House of Energy is so full of goodness. I have been here many times now and from the very first time I was enchanted.

The place sells a number of gemstones, crystals and new age wellness and lifestyle items including salt lamps, tarot and oracle cards, gemstone jewelry, loose chaga tea, books and more. 

The shop is family owned and managed and they all participate in community events as well as host workshops after hours in the store. I attended a tarot workshop recently. 

I feel the rocks in their shop can have a special energy. Recently I purchased one of the amethyst crystals they brought back from a trip to Mexico and I adore it for its beauty and good energy. Some of my favourite pieces ate from this shop. I have also purchased many gifts for family members. 

Really all good things to say about House of Energy!"}
{"text":"Don't shop here. I got some fake crystals the other day. Beware. I like the store, but its overpriced and shady. I've gotten huge authentic crystals for far cheaper elsewhere."}
