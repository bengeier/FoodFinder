{"text":"I am so excited to have a restaurant of this quality in Finleyville.  I've been waiting for this place to open and finally had an opportunity to try some of their food this week. We ordered the mushroom bruschetta, pierogies and cauliflower grilled cheese - all vegetarian items, which is a rare find in this neck of the woods!  There were generous portions and the quality was outstanding. I've definitely found my new neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight with my buddy and our pregnant wives.  They all got steak and cheese sandwiches and I had an Italian hoagie.  Delicious!  You can taste the quality in the meats they use for sure.  Great potato chips and fries, and my wife loved the beet salad.  Staff was awesome, great atmosphere and nice being five minutes from our home in Finleyville.  The owner brought us some ice cream sandwiches that were so good, I went back and ordered some more of their chocolate ice cream.  We will definitely be eating here a few times a week, my wife is already craving another steak and cheese hoagie!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and interesting dishes. Will definitely go back and try more specials. The desserts looked great but didn't try yet. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal! Everything we had was fresh, fast and tasty. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. The chalkboard to the right has their usual offerings, and the boards behind the counter have daily specials. I ordered a blackened swordfish sandwich, and my boyfriend got the lobster roll. We also split an order of pirogies: turkey, bacon, cheese and ranch! We also chugged down lots of homemade lemonade. Our food took no more than 15 minutes. Our server, also one of the owners, was attentive and kind. She answered all our questions about the business and helped us pick something to order. The prices might seem a bit high to some, but for fresh ingredients and the care that went into our dishes, it makes complete sense. My sandwich was large, with homemade chips and a pickle. The fish was perfectly seasoned and a nice, large portion. The pirogies were awesome! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great from scratch food. We had the Italian Hoagir and the Lobster Roll. Both delicious! Also loved the Pittsburgh bottled cola!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Servers were super nice and helpful. Ordered the Brussel sprouts and mixed grain super food salad with salmon. Both were SO good. It's a little pricey but I'll definitely be back!! Can't wait to try the ice cream. Overheard the table behind us say the waffle cones were the best they ever had. Server said they make them fresh! What?!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was very good. Place has very little space for seating, but it was worth the wait. I had a very tasty ribeye that came with an interesting corn salad.  Side of brussel sprouts was perfectly cooked and yummy. Wife enjoyed her pan seared scallops and the corn salad. She would never have gotten the corn salad if it didn't come with her mail, but really enjoyed it. 12 year old loved his cheeseburger and the fries were skinny hot and close to perfection. The pierogies were not good and very unusual but they took them back no problem and were super nice about it. The pizza and the sandwiches others were eating looked good too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly and extremely helpful staff.  We had the pulled pork sandwich and the salmon salad special. My toddler ate a lot of the pork, she kept going back for more! I loved the salmon and the pickled toppings on the salad. Unfortunately I went during my 10 month olds nap time and thought he'd hang in for the food, but he didn't so we had to get it boxed up to go. Our waitress saw my struggle with my crying baby demanding attention and my busy toddler and helped me pack up, even walked my food and extra items my 2 hands couldn't carry to my car. Very thoughtful! We'll be back.  -the phone # doesn't work? I've tried calling several times."}
{"text":"This place marks the 5th establishment in 11 years. It just opened 7 days ago. It began when I called 5 times and no answer, straight to voicemail.  I went to the establishment. I asked if the phone was broke. She said you call an order in. Then she realized what ieant and said it must not work.  At this point I'm like here we go. I ordered and for several items it was $50. Normal price for the area. She said 10 minutes. I'm like no way. I waited 15 minutes and everything was prepared.  The boxes were nicely prepared with there info on them. Food smelled good. The food was really good. There menu was different. This is a big review. I like to point everything out.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff & owners! We ordered a bunch and of things off the menu and It was all good! Smoked wings 10/10 would recommend to a friend. We ordered the crispy Brussel sprout pizza and it was delicious. We brought most of it home because we ordered too much food. I reheated it for dinner added some balsamic glaze and it was even better! Highly recommend. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop into the new place up the street , and we are very glad we did , our son-in law had told us a few months ago about this place opening soon and his buddy knew the chef and had told him everything was going to be made from scratch, any new place I like to give a few week to find a groove so I don't pass judgement too fast , today when we stopped in after 7:00 pm the crowd was small but a mixed crowd, seniors, hipsters, and families with children, so you walk in front door to the counter and the young lady behind the counter tells you that this is not a traditional type of restaurant, you place your order they give you a number you find a table and they will bring it to you , drinks are family friendly ice tea , lemonade and an assortment of sodas , my wife and I decided to have half tea and half lemonade you know Arnold Palmer style, the wife ordered the cheese steak with a green salad that came with white balsamic dressing and homemade potato chips , I ordered one of the specials of the day, they have different specials every day today the double pastrami burger, two burgers , pastrami, fried egg, lettuce, and what tasted like a fresh made dill pickle wedge , the pickle was heavy on dill and the garlic just the way I like it, the burgers were not over cooked pink in the middle fried egg was cooked perfect, and need to find out if they are making their own pastrami because it was very good, the bun may have been fresh made need to ask more questions when I go back, my fries were fine but I've never had fries that I would shout about, my wife's cheese steak looked so good it may be the next times order for me she said it was really good and the roll it was on look like fresh made Italian bread , the steak was thinly sliced and the cheese was dripping out , the homemade chip were crisp and tasty, the green salad we ended up sharing her cheese steak was just too large for her , salad was very fresh greens with some picked red onions mixed in and topped with a pile of bean sprouts, the service was tremendous, all the food hit the table steaming, you must give this place a try great food and very friendly people, one thing more, they have a tip jar at the register and I found it hard to give a tip when you pay before you even get your food , I need to see the food and service first but that's me , I did squeeze a 20% tip my customary for good food and service , I just did it on the way out"}
{"text":"Oh Man Is This Food Good!   Stopped by to get take out since in a hurry.  Order from the chalk boards at the counter.  A bunch of specials on the special board.  The Lamb Gyro was a special and it was one of the best tasting gyros I have ever had.  The only nit is that a couple of bites of the meat were very hard to chew.  It came with some delicious homemade chips and a (I think homemade) pickle.  We also had some of the dry-rub wings which were tremendous.  There are some other wing flavors but the dry-rub were great.   The board said it was BYOB."}
{"text":"This is a new establishment so please keep that in mind as I'm sure they are still sorting things out a bit.  We tried to dine here shortly after they open d but the abrupt and rude girl at the counter caused us to turn around and leave. So we gave them a pass and came back for a second attempt hoping it was more sorted out.   Ordered the Cuban and the Italian.  The Italian was good with quality ingredients and I especially enjoyed the pickled onions. Great addition.  The downfall was the price. At 11 bucks I expected a bit more than a stacked sandwich with some soggy home made chips.   My wife had the Cuban. It arrived a bit charred and the pork was dry.  Cubans are in my experience a pressed sandwich and this was not.  She would not order that again but also enjoyed the Italian she sampled. We both agreed we would head back and try a few more items.    Bottom line....the staff needs to be a little more customer focused with a bit less attitude and the pricing thus far is in my opinion, is a bit high for the items we have sampled.  It's worth a visit and I do look forward to updating my review on the next trip. My rating is based largely on the charred Cuban, staff experience and the pricing."}
{"text":"Visiting family and heard good things so we decided to give it a try. Upon walking in the door we were greeted by friendly, helpful staff that gave great recommendations. Let me just say in our party of 6 we tried a variety of things. Roasted brussel sprouts and wings started off our dinner. Sprouts were terrific and the wings had a dry rub, then smoked to perfection and finished off with a buffalo sauce which was amazing. Spicy sausage pizza was good and the crust was perfect. Scallops were seared and flavorful. Cod sandwich was prepared well with a light flavorful breading and came on a tasty roll. French fries were homemade. Italian sandwich was really good. If you are looking for a farm to table delight, you would be wise to make this place a local favorite."}
{"text":"Heard a new place opened, V&V scratch, so thought we would give it a try. Called in for take out and what a pleasant surprise. The food was phenomenal!  Had the blackened grilled swordfish with guacamole, tomato Bacon lettuce on a buttered bread, flavor was amazing! Others had ribs, awesome, cauliflower grilled cheese, so good, pizza( excellent) tried the Brussels sprouts(great) and the stuffed peppers with a side of marinara . Would highly recommend not your regular food."}
