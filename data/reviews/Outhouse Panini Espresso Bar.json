{"text":"I ordered a soup from here and it was really small. I felt it was overpriced at $3.50 (if my memory serves me correctly), considering it didn't come with a bread roll and I still felt hungry when I left.   The owner is a nice guy and the coffee is pretty good but I found another place that sells coffee nearby and it's almost half the price and just as good - bearing in mind I am happy with a good cup of filtered coffee."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in here today! I'm glad I did! The Outhouse isn't very big but that adds to it's charm. They have a fantastic selection of amazing sandwiches! They are hearty and delicious! William the owner is very nice! If you're thinking of dropping in you should!"}
{"text":"Went in for a latte.  Debit & Credit card machine were down -- no problem, I had cash.  But then I'm told the espresso machine is down too.... so I had a chai tea latte, as per the barista's recommendation.  It was okay.  Just so-so.   But really.... if you are an \"espresso\" place and can't make an espresso.... I think you should have a big sign on the door that day!"}
{"text":"First things first, the customer service at Outhouse is amazing!  The owner, William is pretty much the bee's knees.  He's super friendly and creative and cares about improving the neighborhood and bringing our community closer together through his business.  The cafe is a chatty one and you feel welcome instantly.  The artwork on the walls, the rustic tables, and the fresh food are especially charming.  The sandwiches are delicious and prepared with love and gourmet  ingredients.  They offer hot and cold sandwiches and soup when the weather cools down.  The espresso is fantastic and there is a large selection of cold drinks and teas.  Make sure you try the baked goods too, they come from OMG Baked Goodness which is local so everything tastes fresh and yummy!  I would definitely recommend checking this place out! :)"}
{"text":"I generally like Outhouse, but today I purchased an Americano and it was awful. Tasted like Maxwell House."}
{"text":"Outhouse is delish! Fun, Italian-inspired menu. Great espresso, friendly vibe. The panini are super tasty.   William, the owner, is open and kind. Come in for conversation and yummy food."}
{"text":"Now closed."}
{"text":"Outhouse oozes homey charm. If you find yourself at Jane & Annette with a hankering for a fresh-pressed panini or a nicely made coffee, Outhouse is the place.  More than just a coffee shop, it's a place to chat with neighbours and gab about the local goings-on. Highly recommended for a quick stop or a generally quiet place to read a book. Now featuring Dufflet's baked goods - the gluten free macaron is delicious, until you look at the nutritional information (just don't, really)."}
{"text":"Outhouse has great charm. I always stop by if I am feeling stressed and need to be calmed.  William and all who work here are very friendly and the food is fresh and made to order wonderful.    If you want fresh, healthy and friendly, this is the place."}
