{"text":"I came here on a Thursday around 1pm, it wasn't too busy. I was greeted by a friendly woman, whom I presume is the owner of the place. She was very sweet and welcomed me when I told her it was my first time here. She gave me time to look at the menu and I ordered their signature stuffed beef burger (stuffed with havarti cheese), with a side of sweet potato fries and an orange basil drink. Food took about 10min to make and I ate it there. The burger looked great! So the stuffed burger is really 2 small beef patties with the harvarti in between. I'll note that I didn't really add much topping, just lettuce and onions with the Gigi sauce. The beef patties tasted like regular beef, nothing extraordinary. The meat was well cooked and wasn't greasy (at least compared to a regular burger from Big Smoke's, I'd say Gigi has a a lot less oil).  Because there was more patty than I anticipated, I suggest adding more sauce or more topping to make the burger overall taste better (cuz I mostly tasted beef) . My meat was good, but it was hard to taste the cheese  so maybe add extra cheese. My sweet potato fries were great. They were crispy and even when it cooled down after 30min, it retained most of its crisp. It wasn't oily either. The drink I ended up really liking, I'd definitely get that again. My entire combo was $17.50, which I say is pretty standard to burger joints like these. It's honestly like any other burger place, so ya I'd come again if I felt like it. If I had to redo my experience I'd have added some bbq sauce to my burger in addition to the Gigi sauce."}
{"text":"This was a random find. I tend to ride the 36 finch bus home alot and i saw this place last week and decide to stop yesterday (sunday) after work. The place is new opened 2 weeks ago hence  why i didnt  see it before. Its bright signage is working  if it attracted  me from riding  the bus past.  It was definitely  worth the stop, they serve  their burgers in grams but 200 is 7 ounces  roughly and a beef burger for 8 buck for 200 isnt a bad dea but at the same time it could be better especially  there are certian things  like cheese that is extra which doesnt  really  bother me. It just  will add up for alot of them  and 8 buck burger can be 12 or so  I was reading one of the other reviews i got disagree about the price. Seem to right. Those extra adds is what plays a factor. 1 dollar might  be steep but its fine    On to the food. If it was based  on my initial  taste i would  probably rated them a 3 becauae the fries were  lackluster with no favour but they corrected  that while  i was there with  a new batch and more seasoning and these fries tasted. So much  better.  The burger seem to be freshly ground, nice grill to it and it was tasty and juicy. Still  the better part of my meal.  The service was great as i said they  went out of there way to please with that new batch. So i would  eat again here"}
{"text":"- Limping fries (not crispy at all) but dressing on the fries tastes good - Expect 20-25 mins wait for your burger (even though they have 3 people working in the kitchen) - OK burger, very much overpriced for what this joint is supposed to be. Yelp really should say it's two dollar signs instead of one. - Got charged $2.49 for a can of pop instead of $1.49 (the guy who runs the counter intentionally does that... luckily one of my friends got a bottle out of it). One of my friends who ordered the combo almost did not get the $1 off (had to ask for it).  Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First off, explain that picture (somehow it's not showing but it's the one with the receipts - since it isn't showing, there are three receipts for the same item, lamb burger, but with differing prices 9.99, 10.99, and 11.99. What gives?). Most of the options are unavailable. My burger tastes burnt. My coworker's poutine is cold. And this is supposed to be their grand opening day. I dunno man."}
