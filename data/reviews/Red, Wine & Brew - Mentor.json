{"text":"My friends and I went in for dinner and really enjoyed our meals. We each got a half salad and split the flatbreads amongst the 3 of us. It was good food, but a little pricey for what we got. The salads were nice and fresh, but the flatbreads weren't all the appetizing. The beer and wine selection was really good, but the wine was very expensive."}
{"text":"During our first visit, the host was snotty and acted more like a bouncer. When he called my name to be seated, he wouldn't let the rest of my small group follow me to our table. Then our waiter didn't know the drink menu and asked that WE go to the bar to find out. Our waters arrived in glasses that were warm and cracked, not once, but twice after explaining the issue. Getting service took forever too, and nothing was comp'ed. No managerial attention, and staff was incompetent.

The next visit to the store, the owner ridiculed me for my selection of beers while at the register. And what is it with him showing off his flashy cars to his patrons? This place rubs me the wrong way. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Never again!
Walked in only to see the retail store.  Walked out looking for the restaurant entrance to find a sign saying to enter through the store.
The acoustics are terrible.  You have to yell to talk to the person at your table.  Service is almost non-exhistant.  You have to constantly flag your server.  Servers are too busy  clustered together gabbing!
To order wine, your server sends you to the retail side to buy it.  You bring it to your table and they ding you a \"corking fee\" after you've done the work.
The only person who asked about our experience was the valet.  Too late then.  Even then, the valet had to scramble to find our car.

If the only place you eat out is McD's, you might be impressed. Otherwise, don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!  We were seated in the non smoking patio. After 20 minutes, 10 servers walking by without saying a word, then I had to stop n ask if we had a server.  Another 10 minutes our server comes over, takes our drink order, then delivers, 1 at a time, only 2 of the six drinks ordered. I finally went to the bar and got the rest of the drinks. The worst part, they tried to charge us for drinks they never brought. I understand they are new, however, I think that would be more motivation to hire quality staff!  I haven't even started on the apps that we ordered that came out wrong!  Neat atmosphere and good selection of beer. Will go back to retail store but that's about it!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  The salmon special is the best.  The homemade Chicken and black bean soup was perfectly spiced.  Nothing was over salted which is Always an issue when we go out to dinner.  We wanted to lick the plates clean .This is our second visit.  We took a detour here on our trip from upstate New York to Chicago .    Ashley S. Is a perfect waitress.  She gave us wonderful recommendations on food and was very accommodating.  To top off the dinner we had Berry cheesecake which has a Lemony flavor and a buttery crust, a flourless chocolate tort which is a must for anyone dining here and a chocolate mousse which was velvety and smooth. kiddos to the executive chef, zech taylor.  The coffee  is really good too.  And to top it off, they have a great selection of beer for purchase to take home . as Chris says \"and we get to take home some \"sweet baby Jesus\" beer\""}
{"text":"We've been three times for meals.  The service has always been unsatisfactory.  It's almost like they're training the wait staff to be rude.  They don't check in with you (they weren't busy), they aren't knowledgeable or pleasant. They never know anything about what is on tap.  They do not offer any matching suggestions.  The food was a 2 for lunch, but a 3 for dinner.  The wine and beer selections at the retail store are worth the trip.  I'd give the store alone a 4."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing! The menu is simple, reasonably priced and we enjoyed our selections (Brie app and margarita pizza) the Greek chicken salad was a bit too simple (lettuce cheese and chicken) but still good. Strawberry shortcake dessert was terrific!! Our server was very nice and made great recommendations. All in all we were pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of wine and beers. Small menu for food so it's not a place to go for dinner really but they do have a few sandwiches and pizzas. Food has always been good and this is a nice place to have a group of people meet up at."}
{"text":"Perhaps the widest selection of beers wines ciders liquors etc anywhere around. The prices are average, the staff is helpful, the restaurant is great, no complaints. If you don't go to World Wines and Liquor, this place is right up there."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is a high end beer, wine and tobacco store. Being a cigar fan, I was impressed with selection, and it's hard to argue with number of beers available as well. I must agree with the other reviews though, the service leaves a lot to be desired. My first experience there had me wanting to select a smoke out of one of their humidors only to find that the one I wanted was locked and none of the staff had a key, so I ended up making a different selection. The outdoor patios are nice, but your better off going into the bar and grabbing a drink than expecting the staff to serve you where you're sitting. I think once the newness of the place wears off, parking will be less of a problem, though I have yet to have an issue finding a space."}
{"text":"Service and food last Saturday night wad pretty bad.  Waitress must of had too many tables.  I finished my dinner before my husband received his.  My first beer tasted rancid, my husband went to cooler and got me a \"good old domestic\" one that tasted fine. Dinner salad was bland, no salt and pepper on table.  Ordered coffee and dessert waited forever forever for cheesecake. Its too bad we visited  twice during summer and both food and waiter were great!!  We will try again, once summer comes. Please revise menu; Pork chops, meatloaf, mac and cheese??? What about salmon or tilipia, shrimp, pasta??"}
{"text":"A really nice place hidden away just off Mentor Ave!!

Having said that, I would never eat here if I weren't also interested in a drink!  The attached retail store next door has an amazingly huge selection of beer, wine, and cigars, and I'm able to take all of the above next door to the bar/lounge for only an insignificant corkage fee!!  Can't beat that!

The food is very good if nothing special.  What they do, they do well, but all they do is give me food just good enough to keep me drinking amazing beer and smoking wonderful cigars."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beer, reasonably priced.  The food is acceptable.  It does get very loud, one must yell to be heard by the person sitting next to you.  Sat at the bar and got very good service.  Eat somewhere else, drink here, and buy to take home from here.  Hopefully they can upgrade the parking lot soon.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Incompetent staff under a fresh coat of paint. Don't let the newness of this place fool you, while it looks like a shiny new car the people who work here make this place a lemon. I went with some friends about a week after it opened...we picked out some cigars and went to pay for them. The checkout guy was too busy sweeping the floor to come to the register...so some lady is like \"OK fine I'll get them!\" and came to ring us up. She then proceeds to not give my credit card back to me after finishing the transaction. When I ask for it back she gave it to my friend! Strike one.

We then proceeded to the bar to grab some brews. They poured our drinks into glasses that must have just gone through the washer bc they were still hot when they handed them to us. Beer should not be served in a hot glass...it made the drinks unpalatable. Strike two.

Upon sitting outside to have our cigars and sip our drinks it became pretty obvious that no servers wanted to have anything to do with the back patio. We sat outside for about 30 minutes without a single server coming out to take drink orders. Strike three.

While the cigar/beer/wine selection is amazing, the service is atrocious. I'm not sure where they found these people, but they sure could use some basic customer service lessons. Simply having a nice looking new place won't be sustainable if the employees don't know how to treat paying customers."}
{"text":"Probably the best wine and beer store I have ever been in.  They have pretty much anything you could want or need in that department.  It is pretty cool that you can pick wine or beer off the shelf and drink it (with a corking fee) at the bar.  The only complaint is that the food can be a bit inconsistent, the pizza is serviceable as a drinking snack, but I would not come for the food alone.  They have a cigar smoking area outside that is very nice.  Now that they have fixed the Parking issues, I think they have a winner!"}
{"text":"Been here a few dozen times solely for the beer selection. Every time I am amazed at how AWFUL the service is. Restaurant side takes forever to get a drink or even be acknowledged. The retail side is no better. The head beer guy is a jerk and the only good customer service rep on the beer side has recently been let go. Showed up today to have some beers/watch football. Place was close to empty and I sat at the bar for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Then sat another 5 minutes waiting for my drink to be poured. I walked out and went to winking lizard, served within 30 seconds. Gave this place many chances, this was the last straw for me."}
{"text":"Spicy tomato bisque very good. Menu and food quality has improved since opening.   Plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Five stars for selection and variety.  Two stars for service.  We arrived at 9:30 and had trouble finding a place to park.  We initially walked the retail shop and I was impressed by the variety, especially the beer.  We were asked by three different clerks if they could help us find anything, which was good.  When we went to the dining side, we waited for a good five minutes before we were seated.  Initially, we chose to sit on the patio but that was too loud and chose to sit inside.  Our server was good.  She suggested some wine and told us that the kitchen would be closing soon, so if we wanted to order something we had better do it soon.  There are two televisions in the dining area and I asked if she could have the bartender turn on the Indian's baseball game. They had it showing on the other TV.  I heard her ask the bartender but he never did.  The television we could see just was playing the DirecTV infomercial.  The appetizer we ordered was very good and came out quickly but by then we were the only customers left in the dining room.  The restaurant portion of this place is VERY poorly run.  They could really help themselves by hiring a competent restaurant manager who knows how to run things.  If I do go back, It will just be for the retail side."}
{"text":"Very delicious meal tonight along with excellent service! Pork chop was tender and juicy and tasty. Cilantro rice - YUM! Loved the arugula salad with chick peas and champagne vinaigrette!!!  My hubby had the chicken diavolo - delicioso! Thanks for a great meal and a great night!"}
{"text":"Great concept but poorly executed. Had a group of 8 on Saturday and we all had drinks and dinner. First off the service is TERRIBLE! They have a great selection of beers which is serve yourself but my husband wanted a beer that was on the retail side so they made him buy the entire 6 pack and charged him $1.50 per beer to open even if he didn't drink them all. Ok fine I get it but you would think because the server doesn't have to physically go get the beer he would be on top of the table opening them as people got up to get them... Nope we opened them with a lighter because he never came around. Waters were never refilled and when the food came he gave the wrong pizza to a couple and came back with the rest of the food and said I wish you would've waited to start eating because I gave you the wrong pizza. He blamed us?? Shouldn't you know the food you are serving? The food was mediocre at best. We all got appetizers which were small and just ok. I had soup which was chicken and rice. It tasted good but it was so thick it sat like a rock in my stomach. I will not be back and will definitely not recommend this place. I've been in the restaurant business for 15 years and I just can't understand how you can't train your staff appropriately and notice the quality of food going out? No manager touched our table to ask how everything was. It wasn't until we were walking out the girl at the retail counter asked. At that point you say good and never come back."}
{"text":"In the midst of rural suburbia, a nearly comprehensive library of beer.

The second-to-last stop on an escape from Ohio, stopped by RWB to load up on cheaper-than-NYC beer.  Success.  Head spinning from the selection of refrigerated beers, ended up selecting finding a gem:  two 12-packs of Bell's Two Hearted cans for $19 each.  Not sure how this stacks up in the Midwest, but these things run $16 for a sixer in Midtown Manhattan.

Wine and cigars appear to make up the rest of the collection.  No room in the car for those."}
{"text":"We stopped here as one of our many stops for a bachelorette party. Our server, Josh, was the best person we met all night. Clever, fast, and on it. We loved him so much we took a picture with him. I wish I knew how to add the photo on here.  ::/"}
{"text":"This had a great launch! Today was disappointing. Service was slow. My friend and I came in at happy hour without knowing it. We were encouraged to purchase a bottle of wine! It took forever for our food. It was not that good. A big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Like going there! Great meeting place especially to relax, and look for a favorite beverage. Love the menu. Love the trout!! Friendly servers. Clean! Pleasant! 
However, service is consistently too slow!!! We were there this past Sunday. A few tables my as well been a packed house as poor as the service was. After asking the server to improve wait time, she did however. Until service quality increases I can't rate higher."}
{"text":"Tips for improvement..
1. Get rid of your store bought chips for sandwiches and dips.. it's tacky. homemade chips are cheap, easy and taste better. This isn't a snack bar
2. Make sure your food comes out hot...not Luke warm. 
3. Servers shouldn't be in jeans. 

Atmosphere is great, selection in store is great, and service is great."}
{"text":"Avid supporter of local establishments.
I've been to RWB many times and corrections on my orders are always needed. I have a tomato allergy, mentioned it to the waitress. I ordered the flatbread with pesto to avoid said tomatoes...only to have my flatbread show up covered in cherry tomatoes...and to have my family's food- cold. 
Tomatoes are not listed ingredients on the menu selection.
It was slow. The waitress, I could tell was distracted- but reordered both items with her apologies. She tried. She comped the meal and I tipped to support the original charge. To be fair. 
But It's one thing to choose not to eat something, but it's something else entirely to not be able to...
Pay attention RWB- the health of your customers matters...."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here to buy a bottle of champagne.  We also had lunch out on their patio.  Even though the patio wasn't full, service was slow.  No one was eating inside, so we weren't sure what caused the delay.  The food, (flatbreads), was good but nothing special. We felt it was overpriced.  Enjoyable place to try, but it will not become a local favorite.  Parking is limited.  Alcohol side is awesome."}
{"text":"If you're a wine guy or gal, or like beer (as in all of them) and you like your stogies, this place is for you!   
The wines are exceptional folks. Seriously, name the country, the appellation, the varietal and they're represented and represented well.  All of your California Napa's/Sonoma's/Paso Robles/Lodi etc are represented.  WA and OR, Italian Barolos and Chianti's, French Bourdeux's, a wide array of Ports, from Portugal of course, and .... Well you get the point. They got us covered. From 9.99 to 399.99 they have it. 
Beers from all over the world, tons of crafts from all over the U.S.,  etc etc. 
Cigars are well represented but expect more of a walk-in humidor vs the cabinets. 
All in all, I am a kid in a candy store here. 
By the way the Charcuterie plate of cheese and meats rocks.  
I'll be back !"}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot!  We hosted my parents 40th anniversary party in The Loft and it was fabulous. The room is big and spacious.  We had about 65 guests and it never felt crowded.  The food was delicious and picking out the menu ahead of time was the easiest process ever.  Christine was my contact at RW&B.  She was so helpful and answered any and all of my questions leading up the event.  She was also there the night of the party and made sure everything ran smoothly.  If you are looking for somewhere to host a party, big or small, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to get beer that's hard to find in this area, they were the only store within 100 miles that had it. I can't wait to go back! The store is huge and has such a great selection of beer and wine. I looked around for a few minutes and couldn't find what I was looking for, an employee found it for me but it's easy to overlook something with the variety they have. You can even buy it by the bottle/can, it's nice so you can try new beer without buying a 6 pack. I didn't go to the restaurant But it looked nice."}
{"text":"Loved customer appreciation weekend. Had smoked salmon flatbread, beet salad, and crab cake sandwich. All were delicious. All were half off! Can't beat the $10 bottle of house Pinot noir. Bought another bottle to go for $8! Staff was helpful and friendly. The music upstairs was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Saw this on New Day Cleveland, and it is everything they said it was and more! A must experience on not only their 8,000 wines but their extensive isles of beer in coolers. The restaurant is dark, cozy, warm and inviting with a very long curved bar that has a lighted bar top along with some other tables that are lighted. SO COOL!!!! Beautiful stone wall behind the bar and taps. It gives a nightclub underground feel without going to Downtown Cleveland and being pricey. Many big screen tv's with a variety of channels to watch including The Food Network, or anything to your liking.  Relaxing outdoor patio with black cushy wicker chairs. We did not see ashtrays nor anyone smoking which was an extreme added plus!!!! There is NOT an inch of this place that isn't good to hang out with friends for food, drinks, and conversations. It would be so nice to have something like this closer to home in Twinsburg, but certainly a drive well worth it!!!! We went on a Sunday, which was very pleasant with hardly anyone there. OMG, they always have the Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter from Willoughby Brewing Co., on tap, in which I was in pure heaven!!!! I had the eggplant flatbread and my husband had the shrimp and chicken flatbread. Both were good. Amy C., bartender/server was AWESOME!!!! Great experience all around and look forward to returning with friends."}
{"text":"Can't say we have ever eaten here or that we ever will - we are easy craft beer addicts. 

Selections are spaced out and organized well; staff is incredibly knowledgeable; friendly AND willing to order if they can (which a lot of craft beer places now don't seem to do). 

Went in looking for a hard to find Fatheads ale and while Ron didn't have any he was still willing to try and figure out options of who might - that will keep us going back!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent - Natasha and Jeremy very friendly - go out of their way to remember names and what you drink!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a bottle of wine and a fantastic flatbread at the Wine Down bar.  Mashed potato with bacon and cheddar.  Great service.  We'll be back.  Nice date night!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out because I heard it had a good wine/beer selection, though I think that would be an understatement. The place is one of the larger wine/beer stores that I've come across and it has pretty much all the wines and beers you could possibly imagine! (I think I read somewhere that it has more than 3k different kinds of beers and 10k different kinds of wine).

I was picking up a birthday gift there for a friend and they had some nice bottles pre-wrapped with a bow on them. 

I've also heard that you can pick out a bottle and sit down in the store to drink it. Sounds like a fun thing to do with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Love it when you get blamed for having stickers under your half eaten salad.  Not only that but the everything took two hours to come out . The food was too low quality for the prices and the service was miserable. Thanks for nothing, sucks to suck."}
{"text":"terrible food, even worse service, 
the restaurant has no clue what they are doing,
they need a chef or kitchen management
who knows how to run a restaurant, what a waste of space !!
do not waste your money eating here !"}
{"text":"Went with a large group for Mother's Day brunch. Trying to think of one good thing to say but it was the worst experience and food I ever had at a restaurant. Service was non existent especially considering it was Mother's Day. Lines for the buffet were awkward, and long. It took us over 20 minutes just to get near the food. Food was cold, waffles and French toast couldn't be cut with a knife, and much of the selection should have been replenished. To get back in line to get what was missed just wasn't worth it. Tables were so packed in that one could hardly move around to get up without disturbing other people. 
It just seemed that the owners wanted to take advantage of Mother's Day crowd  and once inside it was too late for our group to leave. The cost of the  brunch with added 18% gratuity  was so overpriced for no service, no edible food, and uncomfortable seating. 
The first place we went to after leaving was a fast food place to get something to eat that was fulfilling. 
They may have a good wine and beer selection but I would not return."}
{"text":"Very small food menu but plenty of drinks! Definitely not a place for dinner. Although it is. I've to drink a beer while shopping in the store area for another and/or wine. Also a cigar shop, not my thing, but it's there."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong this place is cool and the drink selection is humongous (both beer and wine). However, I would NOT recommend coming here for dinner. The food was good, but it took almost an hour and 15 minutes after we ordered to get it. You can order sandwiches either cold or hot. Of the 5 people in out party 4 ordered sandwiches and all of them were cold by the time out food was served. One of the sandwiches looked like it WAS warm at some point, but can't say the same for the others. This is def more of a place to get drinks and maybe an appetizer or two, but I highly doubt I'll be going back for dinner. It's a shame too bc I like the concept a lot. Maybe I'll give it 6 months or so to get their act together...we shall see!"}
{"text":"We went in and decided to stay for a quick drink and appetizer.  We were surprised at how big it was but didn't enjoy the food that much."}
{"text":"Whoever trained the staff here, should be put in charge of the world.  ;0)  

Everyone is personable and could not be more helpful or polite.  No matter your issue, they will go the extra mile to make you happy.

8,000 bottles of wine, 3,000 beers, and 1,000 cigars...  What's not to like?  There's even an outdoors room with fireplace and overhead heaters for cigar aficionados.  This is the \"go to\" place for my wife, my son, and me."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Service at the bar is always very very slow and frequently verging on rude. Decided to try for dinner. Cod was fair. Sirloin steak was tiny and both a little pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"When this place first opened up it was an insane asylum to try to find a place to park here. As with any new business a lot of people flocked to her right away and kept coming to the point where they had to have valet parking arranged show people wouldn't start parking illegally and get towed which is what happened at first. I really like the retail side versus The bar Side primarily because they have an insane selection of beers and wines the likes of which I haven't seen anywhere else on the east side. They don't really have a sommelier on hand unlike one of the other local wine stores but they have people that can make some pretty good suggestions on the list. Have some really unique and hard-to-get beers for example blue bird English bitters they have some really unique and hard to get beers for example Bluebird English bitters which I am most of never seen any we're here but I was able to locate and they had a6 pack of which I was able to take home and enjoy almost immediately and I've never been so happy. Happy. Great job on the selection of beers.  The restaurant side is way too busy for me."}
{"text":"Jen was the best!  Great service, fun to talk with.  We're here, um, a lot.  By far one of our favorites to visit with.  Oh, and let's not forget a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience!  I took my family there to celebrate a birthday on a Saturday night.  There were 7 of us.  It took forever for any food to come (about 45 min after ordering).   When it did come, only half our party got food.  The others waited a full 10 minutes MORE before theirs came - including the birthday boy!  The clueless server seemed to think nothing of it, saying something like, \"they make the food in stations and some comes up before others\" - whatever that means.  There was no manager or hostess in sight to complain to. The food was very mediocre at best - and even that may be a bit generous.   Finally, the music from the live band was so loud we had to literally scream at each other the entire dinner.  It was a miserable dining experience.  None of us could wait to get out of there and no one from my party will ever return."}
{"text":"I had super super high hopes for this place. Now after being there several times I always leave disappointed. Food is subpar and the service is not good. The best part is the wine selection and the sommelier.  With a better menu and and more attentive staff this place would be great!"}
{"text":"Look at all the reviews and good thing I did notl   Listen  to them service was very good ate at the bar bartender was very friendly donot know about the reviews about bad service all the wait staff were working hard there beer and wine selection is awesome looking forward to come back"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. 
First, we were confused where to walk in. You walk in to a convenience store and you need to be told where to go to get to the restaurant. Ridiculous. Then, when we got in, they were hammering and still putting the bar and countertops together! WHY ARE YOU EVEN OPEN IF CONSTRUCTION  ISN'T FINISHED?!

Ok. So here's the real reason I'm so pissed: when we complained to get up to leave, NO ONE stopped us. NO ONE offered us anything (no drink, no gift certificate, no NOTHING). 

Bad management. Bad service. I can imagine having a bad meal and no one caring. NOT ever coming back. Don't support a business that treats a table of FOUR paying customers like this."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 visited R,W & B last evening (Saturday).  We had reserved a time and were promptly seated outside.  Nice patio area. One of he lady's selected a beer from the cooler and had it opened by the server quickly.  Then it got a little weird.  We ordered 2 flights and appetizers. We were then served ice water.  In the time it took for the flights to arrive, our friend's car wast struck by another vehicle in the lot, they exchanged information, cleaned up the broken taillight and still had time to spare.  It took 25 minutes to get the flights of beer and only one of the 8 samples was delivered to the correct person.  In fact, one flight board had two of the same beers. The waitress was very good, very friendly and apologetic.  They discounted our bill for some of the beer samples which was nice.  We ordered another beer before or meals arrived but they did not arrive for another 25 minutes, after we were done eating.  The food was good.  The antipasto meat and cheese board was advertised as including two meats, but only had one.  The burger and turkey wrap was good as were the pretzels.  Friends enjoyed their meals as well although the lemon grass chicken was reported to be flavorless.   The checks came and they were a hodgepodge of charges which we ultimately deciphered without the help of the server. The beer selection and pricing inside  the store was amazing.  Never have I seen such a great variety of beer and wine under one roof.  The great attitude of the server and manager on duty really salvaged this visit and I'd return to give them another chance.  I hope they address staffing issues and that the bartender does a better job of pouring the correct (or close to correct) beers on the sampler flights for other guests.  Had the issues been less, they would have gotten a \"four\" (for the beer selection , not the food) and had the server been worse, it might have been a \"two\" rating.  She was good tho, and did the best she could."}
{"text":"The attached store has a mind boggling selection of beers and wines. It's definitely become one of our \"sites to see\" when out of town guests come to visit. Wouldn't eat in the lounge. Poor service and the food, ugh. We go around the corner to Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"Wine or beer this is a great place for a drink and the food was wonderful too.  Went when they first opened and there were some obvious struggles, but there has been a lot of improvement.  Great service, food and drink selections.  And the location and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"If you're thinking of coming here. Don't bother. We ordered the garlic Parmesan chicken wings and they were dried out and over cooked.  Then ordered the hamburger Med. It came out, cold, dry and on a cold bun!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night. Love the atmosphere here. They had a saxophonist for entertainment. The volume was enjoyable and you could carry on conversation, but it was mostly Christmas music and it was a week before thanksgiving! The service at the bar was friendly & attentive without being over bearing. 

We ordered the full order of 12 honey chipotle wings. They were meaty and the flavor of the sauce was EXCELLENT! After checking in we received a $.50 wing special deal. We also had the RWB BBQ burger ordered medium. It came with kettle chips. The burger came out well done and was almost 2\" smaller in diameter than the bun. There was very little BBQ flavor there. I'd have to say, \"where's the beef\" as this plate was $12. The bun was good, but a tad crumbly. I was not at all satisfied with this dish and will not order it again. 

There's a nice selection of craft beers on tap. They also offer an extensive by the glass wine list and have a full bar and specialty drinks. You can also buy any wine or beer from their retail shop to consume in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this great looking place on a Wednesday evening.  The store attached is IMPRESSIVE!  We were able to get a seat on the nice patio.  Our server was very nice but never in a hurry to get to us. I would say they affected the review just an observation.  The appetizer of Sweet potato fries were good.  I had a flat bread and half portion of the side salad. The salad was fantastic and huge. The flat bread was not as impressive kind of chewy crust for a flat bread.  Friend had the Cobb salad I was not impressed looking at it (small and hardly any bacon). Other friend had a sandwich and the fries with it came out cold. Nice beer list on tap.  If I lived close I would definitely want to stop in for a beer and a appetizer"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and server Natasha was super friendly. 

Try some beers and then walk next door and buy a six pack of it! 

Wish we could have tried the sriracha crab dip. There's always next time..."}
{"text":"1st timer: really neat atmosphere in the dining area. I sat at a high top and we were served immediately- wine came right over when ordered and our server was a delight. Spinach artichoke app is mouth watering delicious. 
Ordered the Smoke House burger... ehhh. Didn't really have any smoked flavor I could taste, just like a regular burger. It wasn't bad by any means but I wasn't over the moon about it and wouldn't order it again. 
Dessert was basic but tasty. 
I will def be returning with my pal for a casual night out. I love the atmosphere- although a bit noisy- and NEEED NEEED NEEED to try one of those flatbreads that kept walking past me"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. If you can't find or don't know what you want ... Ask Joshua!  Great server and paired our meal and drinks perfectly. Spend the time browsing the aisles of wines and coolers of brew before joining them in the lounge for pretty good food."}
{"text":"Let me start with how terrible the service is at the restaurant. We sat down waiting for our party of 20 people. We ordered beers and my fiancé's came in about 5 mins. The waitress was getting the table set up with waters and pitchers as I sat there and waited for my draft beer. 10 minutes went by and my fiancé was done with his beer and I still didn't have one. More guests arrived and she took their drink orders and still no beer for me. Finally after 20 mins my beer came. We ordered 2 flatbreads and crab dip. The flat breads are great and came out really fast but no dip? No why wouldnt we get our app first? We got the crab dip and it wasn't great but we didn't get enough bread to dip and had about half of the dip was still left.  So I asked the server for more bread and she never brought it. The server didn't clear empty bottles off the table and whenever we needed something we had to ask another employee. She was missing the whole night with a party of 20. Then we got our bill and the gratuity was included. Now I know it is a policy for a party of more than 20 but this girl did not deserve 11$ on a $70 bill. My fiancé asked her to take it off and she said she couldn't. Most likely will not return. They really need to work on training their servers. It was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Retail store selection is hands down the best in the area. Cool concept of being able to buy items individually and consume them in the lounge. Eaten here a few times and while the menu is smaller then most would probably care for, it has been servicable. They recently added lots of new parking and will be opening a new patio as well."}
{"text":"I'm AMAZED by the selection here, for wine and beer both! Best selection in Lake County. The organization is very educated. ... owners clearly know how regional variations impact product. Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Food isnt great, but not terrible--and really, in a place like this it takes a back seat to the libations anyway!"}
{"text":"The retail store is spectacular! The menu seemed impressive but the proof was definitely not in the product. Everything seemed like it could be heated up in a microwave or came frozen. Service was unprofessional & very amateur. Beautiful atmosphere & very cozy but definitely not worth the price & lack of quality."}
{"text":"Was excited when this place opened but now disappointed that it's really a wine and beer retail store. The restaurant is lacking in variety and taste."}
{"text":"This is a lovely and original store/restaurant. On one side there is a cigar bar... I will be honest and say that I've never been on that side of the establishment. I can't stand cigar smoke but by what I've experienced in the rest of the place, if you are into smoking cigars, this will be your place to go. The middle section of RWB is an adult candy store full of every kind of beer and wine you could dream of. It is available to purchase to take home or drink in the dining area. The final section of RWB is the dining area... there's funky lit tables and an amazing selection of booze and food. The outdoor patio has glass doors that can be opened wide in summer weather or closed tight to watch the winter snow. When it comes to food, I've never had anything I didn't like. I recommend sharing a bunch of appetizers and flat breads while sampling all the delicious libations they have to offer. It makes a great Sunday Funday with friends!"}
{"text":"Was ok. Thought it was kinda neat I guess to have a store in the restaurant to buy smokes and beer. Service at the bar was pretty shabby. The lady was short and rude with us. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich And was really spicey for my Taste. And my mother in law ordered the garlic mashed potato flatbread and they put a jalapeño sauce on it which she says wasn't mention (could be wrong) I didn't eat any of my meal because of it.  Bartender didn't even acknowledge it and brought me a box. Normally when a patron doesn't eat their food we are asked  if it is ok or if we didn't like it. I should have said something but i hate sending food back. May or may not return."}
{"text":"Totally in love with this place.... great for beer and wine snobs without feeling pretentious. Love love love"}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Thursday afternoon.   Place very empty, but good activity in the wine and beer sections.    Great selection of Beers.    Lunch was pretty good, menu had mostly flatbreads and sandwiches, and service was excellent.   It would  be a fun place for a group to meet to sample beers and appetizers.    The store is huge and very clean.   I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Can not believe this place is not reviewed higher! First, where can you get non domestic beers for $3 in a dining setting. Have had food here several times and enjoyed the trip dip today. 

The beer and wine selection are also great and the staff is more than willing to help you choose something! A great place in Mentor/Lake County!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! Can't wait to see what it's going to be like come summer.  Service was a bit off key but that's expected w a restaurant/bar that's new to the area.  Has awesome wine selections and awesome beer selections!"}
{"text":"Here for dinner with the wife she ordered the crab cake I ordered the cod with the pretzel appetizer.

Great service, food, wine and beer. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was there for the very first time for a bridal shower. The upstairs was HUGE! Food was pretty good. 

I took my husband there specifically for the beer store & We've never been more disrespected in our lives! The so-called beer guru is a joke. My husband likes to drink and knows more about beer then this guy. He literally leaned against the front counter, arms crossed, not once did he make eye contact with us, it felt & sounded like he was talking down to us like we were nothing!"}
{"text":"This place has any wine you could possibly want. Very clean and decor is nice. The staff there is extremely helpful. Haven't eaten here yet."}
{"text":"I stopped in the retail store the other day and had a good experience. They had one of my favorites of the season: Revolution's Rosa Hibiscus Ale. Staff were helpful and set aside their Rosa supply for me to pick up after I called to inquire - excellent customer service! Glad this place is here, will try the restaurant next visit."}
{"text":"Back again and again, great great great!!! Tremendous wine selection for those who love wines.  BUT for you beer officianados, coolers with such a selection it would be hard pressed NOT to find your choice. 

Food: Menu has been changed and offers a great selection of burgers,  salads,  flatbreads, and more. 

If you haven't been here in awhile or ever, you must put this on your \"must visit\""}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great night out with family or friends, you should definitely visit Red Wine & Brew Restaurant!  This place is a Wine, & Beer lovers paradise.  With a selection of countless Wines & Beer, from around the world, you are sure to find one that resonates with your palate!  The service is excellent, staff is very friendly, and the restaurant has a variety of delicious dishes which go very well with your selection of Wine &/or Beer!!  If you want to plan a big event, you can book a room for company or family/friends get together event/party. I will definitely visit this restaurant the next time I plan a trip to Mentor!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but very loud.  Sat in bar area, and had difficulty getting attention of server to order drinks.  Had to question order, as the beer menu stated our beer was a 16oz, but was served in a 10 oz snifter.  When we asked them about it, bartender said he never noticed, and they have been serving in a 10 oz since they opened.   A second server ( Natasha) told us that the menu was wrong and they had not corrected it yet.  Natasha had a snotty attitude.  Retail side is great, but most likely won't be back to the lounge area."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience at another restaurant, a friend suggested we hit Red, Wine & Brew.  What a great place!

The beer selection was tremendous.  I found some old favorites (Lindeman's Lambics in Peach and Cherry) I rarely see outside of specialty spirit shops.

The place was really clean, and the decor is cool.  Our server was friendly, fast and helpful.

I bought my wife a 6-pack of Bass Ale, which they kept in a cooler at the front.  We paid a corkage fee ($1 per bottle) which brought the cost of each bottle to around $2.50  Not bad, for imported bottles.

The food was excellent.  I bought a $12.00 burger with cumin aioli, guacamole, and salsa.  Really delicious.  My wife asked for grilled chicken on a small ceasar salad.  The chicken was cooked in a garlic and rosemary white wine reduction.  I'm definitely getting that the next time we go.

Tonight, they had a 14 year old kid playing saxophone.  The kid was really impressive.  It sounded like a professional performance to us.  It was a great night with friends listening to some jazzy live music and enjoying great food and cold drinks.  All at a really reasonable price."}
{"text":"One of the most extensive selections of beer in town. I love the ability to peruse the coolers before I made my selection.   The beers are very reasonable as well. My only complaint would be the food choices. Nothing I tried was impressive. It would be nice to have bar snacks, but the majority of the menu consists of flatbreads."}
{"text":"Terrible TERRIBLE service, TERRIBLE food.  Very disappointed.  We were really hoping for a regular place in Mentor.  This definitely wasn't it!"}
