{"text":"Delicious! I got their Primetime Players Deal which is 2 medium 1 topping pizzas, 8 piece garlic bread, 8 piece wings and a 2 liter Coke and I spent less than $25. The garlic bread is buttery and cheesy, the pizza was also very good, just the right amount of grease and the wings are non breaded whole wings. The wings were on the smaller a side but still decent. Delivery took about an hour however it's NYE so that's pretty good compared to other places who quoted me 1 1/2 to 2 hours for delivery. I deducted a star because I did not receive my 2 liter of Coke. Not a big deal but I will update my review once I see how it's resolved."}
{"text":"Delivery took about an hour and a half to arrive. I ordered a pizza, Italian hoagie and pepperoni bites. The pizza was near cold. The other items were a bit warmer, but not fresh or hot any longer. The pizza was lackluster at best. Very light on sauce and cheese. The hoagie would have been better if it were just completely tasteless and the pepperoni bites were downright disgusting with crunchy burned cheese on them and small bits of pepperoni wedged in the soggy bread. I'll never order from this shop again with so many other incredible options available in the city."}
{"text":"Parmesan bites are very good but there's where it ended for me. I got delivery at work on a friday using a local service that rhymes with slub snub.  Have used this service many times with zero issues.  I ordered a chicken parm and parmesan bites. they arrived quickly. too quickly.  the bites were amazing.  good thing too, because the chicken was raw. red, gelatinous, raw. I contacted slub snub and they refunded me the amount of the entree and I assumed it was over. not so fast! being a considerate consumer, I left a review (3 stars, not 1) on the slub snub site for mamma mia pizza saying basically i'd try them again but stay away from the chicken.  forward to early afternoon saturday and I got an email from slub snub saying mamma mia had refunded my entire purchase price. super! nice of them to go above and beyond. Then the phone started ringing. I got a total of seven calls, four from their delivery driver, three from the restaurant. I did not answer the phone because to me, it was over. you gave me a refund, thank you, we're done. why is your delivery guy calling me?  then I got a text. \"hey, it's a mamma mia, my driver is waiting for you outside on xx ave (outside my workplace) can you call us back or can you come meet my driver please\".  weird, huh? I texted back that I was not at my workplace on saturday and to please leave me alone as I was still sick from the bad food they'd sent me the day before. (I was-I had a mild case of food poisoning) So to make a long story short, very weird borderline stalkery experience. caveat emptor.  and my slug snub review has gone missing."}
{"text":"They seem to be falling off...I bought a 2 pizzas last week they were not the same..they didn't put on what I ordered  and tried to add it afterwards didn't work..after about a half hour of surgery they decided to make another..got home know one ate it.. tried a veggie hoagie last nite it was a disaster chopped up veggies trying to cut corners i guess 11.95 it was flat like a pancake.. bread didn't taste fresh I don't like doing this but it is what it is..its hard to find halal places  they could make it desirable.. I guess go I'll go back to subway for my veggie.."}
{"text":"Solid delivery. I'm a huge fan of the cheese or pepperoni pizza and the garlic bread is to die for. The wings were shaky, but the pizza and garlic bread is always solidly good. Great choice for pizza delivery!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars...horrible, H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E customer service. Took almost 2 hours to deliver a cold a$$ pizza and repeatedly told me the driver was \"5-10 minutes away\"...will never order again!!!"}
{"text":"I did not like it.  I got meat on my pizza and it had a funny taste,  like it had freezer burn.  I might try again with veggies only but for the price,  domino's is better. The service was really nice though"}
{"text":"Same hotel, same Mamma Mia, same results!  I love their pizza!!!  NY style with pep and jalape√±o and just as good as I remembered!  Well done and promise to continue to come back when in town."}
{"text":"This place is quite amazing.  My coworkers and I have been opting for this place for lunch so frequently that when we call in and ask for delivery they already know where that order is going.  I honestly cannot complain about the quick service or great food that I have devoured from here.    We started ordering from here when their menu was nothing more than one sided and sparse on selection.  Luckily we continued to order from here and watched this place grow and watched items added to the menu on a consistent basis.  As the business grew, we also noted the prices started to rise and some minor changes came with the menu.  Don't let that deter you as the prices haven't gone up that much and the changes on the menu are all for the better.    What's my go to dish here, it's hard to say, but I always end up leaning towards one of their pasta dishes.  You could go with the Penne pastas which are usually a solid deal.  If one of the already noted combinations isn't to your fancy you always have that option to make your own.  With all the possible combinations of sauces and toppings that may end up being a hard task to figure out the perfect pairings for your palette.  Or if you like you get one of the Brooklyn style dinners.  A larger portion of pasta that could honestly be a dinner for two.  Comes with a garden salad and some garlic toast.  I can never finish this thing when I order it and I have to say that it is definitely worth the few dollars extra."}
{"text":"When I review pizza places let me just clarify its hard for me to give 5 stars. Every city I go to the first thing I seek out is pizza so that's the reason I give a 4. I ordered directly from the Yelp app which quoted me 45-60 mins for delivery which was fine because they were telling me up front. But my pizza arrived in under 30! The deal was 10.99 for a 2 topping XL, honestly a fantastic deal. The pizza was very very good. I enjoyed the sauce, crust, and cheese. Only complaint would be that the mushrooms were a big soggy. But for 10.99 I'm not gonna be that picky. I would absolutely order again. Where I live doesn't have the best delivery options so I'm really glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and the hotel recommended this place. The pizza was fantastic. Tons of cheese and pepperoni. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really not worth the review, but this place is what you should expect. Average pizza at best, awfully awful wings and the delivery took around an hr and a half and they are about 20min down the road...walking.   I'm sure they mean well but this place is pretty much the dive-bar of pizza joints. You don't order from here because you love them, you order because you didn't feel like a chain pizza place and this was close. I won't order again because I moved.I think it's called mamma mia because if you spoke Italian, or for some reason only sometimes exclaim \"MAMMA MIA\" when you're surprised or baffled by how bad something is, you would say that after(or while) dealing with this place... But hey, give it a shot, maybe Mamma Mia pizzeria is for you."}
{"text":"We have had delivery from mamma Mia's before. Early on it was kind of blah but ok since they are open super late so I didn't expect much. Food is always old looking or cold. But we have been ordering from here pretty frequently because we are in the food industry so we get off work late. The thing is there was not one thing that we had ordered that was correct ever. EVER!! Food quality is subpar to be nice. Sad to say I'll go hungry before I place another order here. Pizza is not easy to mess up but they do a great job of doing so.          On another order I asked simply to have just turkey on a hoagie they had that had ham also . I simply said to remove the ham and just use more turkey. Literally received a full loaf of bread with two slices of turkey on it.  Can't say I'm surprised"}
{"text":"This the worst place ever. They delivery my hoagie and didn't knock or call me but they left on the porch in a chair.and when I can to inquire as to why the person on the phone was super rude and hung up on me a few times. This a never ever order place."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for delivery when I was staying in Pittsburgh on business since they had menus in the hotel lobby.  I ordered chicken tenders and they were straight up RAW in the middle.  Looked exactly like raw chicken.  I bit into it because the outside breading was cooked, so I ate raw chicken.  I called back and requested a new order be delivered, not angrily and got MAJOR attitude.  They never ended up making the new delivery so I called back the next day and requested a refund and they told me they gave me a refund.  Never got the refund either.  I told the hotel to remove the menus from the lobby.  I could have easily gotten foot poisoning from them and they lied about issuing a refund."}
{"text":"Ordered: NY Style Large Pepperoni and Steak Deluxe Hoagie Delivery Total: $33.68 including $2 delivery fee  The pizza was good but does not invoke memories of NY style pizza.  It reminds me of multiple pizza places around Pittsburgh, not NYC.  4/5  The cheesesteak was just your average lackluster attempt to put frozen minute steaks into a store bought hoagie roll and charge $12 for it. It says that it comes with fried onions. That is false. They may have thrown the onions onto the grill but they were still raw. The bun was your typical store-bought hoagie roll from Restaurant Depot. Lastly, the mushrooms are from a can and were just as uncooked as the onions.  I see absolutely nothing special about their food."}
