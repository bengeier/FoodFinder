{"text":"Fun date hang-out. Lots of beer selection - which I enjoyed. Reminded me a little bit of Black Hoof - except the fact their food isn't as good. But for drinks & snacks on a nice summer's day this is definitely a place to check out.  Just curious how their business will be in winter, seeing as half the seats are located outside."}
{"text":"Awesome, spacious, patio and a GREAT place to have a beer on a Friday afternoon.  The beer is very yummy, and the staff are super friendly and very accommodating.   Can't speak for what it is like at night.    My husband and I have been here several times with our sleeping baby in a stroller for a pint, and have always had a great experience.  Most beers are brewed on premise, and change periodically."}
{"text":"This place has the nicest patio however the wait is super long! Love the ambiance, prices are okay - the food menu is quite limited though. May come back when I am in the neighbourhood next time."}
{"text":"Yelps limitation of only full stars makes the review for this place a little difficult, since I would probably give them 4.5 if I could as its a must visit but there are some minor complaints.  Probably the best brewery in Toronto, constantly trying new things which means you usually will never need to get the same thing (not that there is anything wrong with that). They have their staples, a few APAs, their sour Jelly King, and an IPA or two, but the rest is constantly changing.  The place is always crazy busy, get there an hour after they open and there are usually lines, there are even lines before they open often! So be prepared to wait if you are a larger group (3+) Now my only complaint is it is definitely on the pricier end of the spectrum as far as brewpubs go, but considering the permalines and the fact their limited releases usually sell out within a day I think I may be alone in this remark.  The food is quite good, a bowl of fries is common for our table, but like mentioned above the food is a little too much for what it is.  Another nice thing is that they always keep your water glass full, which helps prevent the potential for hangovers or anything else, I hate that I have to usually ask for water with my beer at most places."}
{"text":"I need to preface this review:  I love their beers. However, after the way I was treated tonight - I am not sure I can continue to drink them. We were brought to our \"area\" (we were a group of 5 and after asking if she could text us when they were ready for us - the hostess left without taking our number. Thus, when we returned, she blamed us for the snafu. We did not chase her down. Whatever.) Then, before even taking our order, the waiter gave this lecture to my friend. Ostensibly telling him to quiet down and behave. He alleged there had already been an incident with him. We were sober, and we were joking about the failed texting situation.    The waiter was so condescending and such an asshole - we left. I am still flabbergasted at the way he treated us. We were paying customers, out to have a good evening. He treated us like they didn't want our money. They didn't get it. Other craft breweries have beer that is just as good. I will give my money to them."}
{"text":"Great beers, service and atmosphere! Got a chance to enjoy the patio, so it was a wonderful afternoon."}
{"text":"Great addition to Ossington and probably the best patio (or at least largest) in King/Queen west outside of the Drake Rooftop and Williams Landing in Liberty (ok and maybe also the new Origin in Liberty).   Love that this place is a restaurant that knows food but is also a micro brewery which is bringing in some great local beers.   The staff were knowledgeable and were very personable.   Line-up when we went was ridiculous - waited 1 hour which is long but it was all worth it in the end. Its what you expect to do for a new hot spot.  If you are in the hood and its great weather go.   Look forward to seeing how this patio-centric spot does once the snowfall hits."}
{"text":"Never  been treated so poorly by a waitress. This actually happened:  She asked me and my friends for ID (we are all 23-26) before serving us. When we took a minute to think about which drink we wanted she said \"wow you guys are really bad at this\". She continued to be insanely rude to us the entire time she was serving us from behind the bar for absolutely NO REASON.   While we were drinking she went off duty and started flirting with a guy sitting next to us at the bar. As we were leaving she said loudly to him \"23 year olds are so f***ing stupid!\", looking right at us. She then laughed loudly and said \"Oops!\" as if she hadn't intentionally insulted us in some pathetic attempt to impress this guy who seemed to have no interest in her. It was all the most bizarre experience my friends and I have ever had."}
{"text":"In a cinch, Bellwoods is a microbrewery that serves snacks. Don't make the mistake of coming here for a complete meal (like me!), and you'll really love it. My first impression was that it's very...hipster-ish. The neutral pastel colour scheme along with the chalk boards remind me of an old fashioned school house. All the servers are wearing some sort of flannel or suspenders, which added to my initial impressions. For a second it made me forget that we were in the heart of downtown Toronto.   All the beer offered at Bellwoods primarily brewed at the back of the restaurant. I settled on whichever the waitress suggested as the most popular beer. Can't go wrong with that, right? This ends up being the Farmhouse Saison It's relatively clean and easy drinking. Someone looking for a heavier beer can try the Witchshark IIPA offering 9% alcohol goodness. I had one sip of my friend's, and trust me you can definitely taste the jump in alcohol content!! *cringe face*  My friends and I ended up trying all the snacks on the menu (we were STARVING!)  Hits:  --The Raw Beef with Sour Vegetables : a must order for anyone who appreciates a nice carpacio --Duck with Hop shoots and Beet : deliciously prepared bite size portions of duck in a nice vinaigrette sauce --Pig Heart with Serrano hot sauce : just order it.   Misses:  -Cucumber sticks with paprika: really plain. I could stick a cucumber stick in the microwave and create something similar.  -Potato with anchovy mayo: under cooked and again, relatively plain -Wheat kernels with hen of woods and chickweed: just something about eating that really turns me off.   Bottom line:  love the atmosphere, love the beer, great snacks. :)"}
{"text":"It was a great idea that I went here the other night with people who are bartenders.  The consensus among the group was that the beer was excellent!  And it was.  All of us agreed that we would continue coming back here (if we can find a table).  Why did I only give it three stars?    It took over an hour for our food to arrive!  All of us ordered the flat iron steak and sides of corn.  I cannot understand why tables around us were getting food, while we sat there with grumbling tummies.   We were told the corn would arrive within 10-15 minutes.  Not so.  When the steaks did arrive, the serving size was a bit tiny and the mini-potatoes were warm with the steak more on the cold side.  It is a shame because the steak itself was tasty, but it is not acceptable to wait over an hour and only get cold steak and adorable mini-potatoes.  I agree with others in that it is a great place for beer and snacks, but not recommended for a meal."}
{"text":"stumbled upon the opening night of this new Ossington fixture and couldn't have been happier!   Small, but comfortable space (high ceilings so it's not claustrophobic). Love the general ambiance of being right in the brewery... beside the open kitchen... sitting at long bars.  Like I'm part of the process vs. being served from a far.   Mike/Luke are great guys... and so are all the staff I spoke with that night.  It was their first 'public' night so still working out a few kinks, but overall service was friendly, knowledgeable, quick, etc.   Food menu is perfect - simple small 'tappas' style snacks.  But not your standard pub grub which is a nice change.   Beer (the raison d'etre) was excellent.  Went through the Pale Ale, the Saison, and Toil/Trouble dubble.  All were just excellent, though I particularly liked the Saison.. refreshingly different.   I also liked that they're not just pursuing the \"we have more 'hops' than you do\" approach to microbrewing which seems overly present in Ontario efforts to date.   Beers are 12 and 16oz  (depending on the brew in question), and seemed to range from 8$-9$.  They're worth it (you're not just getting some leftover Molson swill)... but prices could afford to go down a notch.... perhaps special event nights, promotional pints, happy hour, etc.     I would also kill for a sampler 'plate' of all of their beers (eg. 5 x 3 oz samplers) just to taste the full repertoire before committing to one brew (though Mike said he was adding that to the system... so it's probably there by now!).   Otherwise... just a great all round experience and a nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yes there are hipsters here and probably long lines if you come later in the day on a weekend but we need to be honest...the beer here is fantastic.  We had the cheese plate to add some padding for the drink which was very good.  I'm very glad I stopped into their retail store to grab a few for the road!  Kudos to this place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood vibe. Delicious beers on tap, and a beer store that is open late. Perfect!!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food but the beer selection is great, and we were given tasters when unsure about what to order. The best part of this place is definitely the outside seating area, so unfortunately you'll be relegated to the inside during the winter."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been dying to try this place and last night we finally made it! First of, the ambiance of the place made drinking a couple of beers a very romantic experience. There was seating on the patio, first floor, or a very tiny upstairs. We went up because it was more secluded. My friend opted for the monogamy wet hop which smelt as fruity and refreshing as it tasted. I ordered the Baltic porter which was a dark beer that was smooth and rich. Overall, candlelight beer at $8 a pop is probably one of the best ways to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I love craft beer and this is one of my fav. craft brewers.  They have a bottleshop and a brewery with changing selection. Better yet, all the beers have cool posters and are really one off. A word of warning, the best ones get sold out quickly so enjoy while they last.  Important to note a lot of the beers are high alc. content so don't drive. They also have a great patio but you have to get there early.  Great place to take a friend !"}
{"text":"We've been a bunch of times now and have always had a great experience.  Some of the best beers in the city, comfy atmosphere, good snacks, friendly and knowledgable staff.  Owners Luke and MIke are always gracious and take time to say hello.  Server John always a pleasure to talk too and very knowledgeable about the beers.  Look forward to coming again and again."}
{"text":"Came our way as a recco from a friend and it did not disappoint.  Coming from Vancouver where craft brew is the rage we were impressed with the variety.  Atmosphere was awesome with an heated outdoor patio tucked off the street.  My only suggestion would be if they had a beer sampler option where we could choose 3 or 4 sample sizes."}
{"text":"the selection of beer is quite refreshing and different. in terms of recommendations I would recommend any beer aside from the Berliner weisse. really weird taste that does not go well with anything. the duck heart is really good as the sauce was a perfect match. in terms of seats I would recommend the patio or upstairs!"}
{"text":"This microbrewery is AWESOME!!  Service was great and we had the opportunity to try out 6 different beers without being bloated to the point of explosion.  They have small little snacks to have with your beer which are reasonably priced.  I would recommend sitting on the second floor where you get a view of the big vats used in their brewing process as well as other fellow beer drinkers.  Just visiting in Toronto and I wanna go back here before I leave!  Great ambience in the place where it is not so quiet you can hear crickets but not so loud you you have a conversation.  TWO thumbs UP!"}
{"text":"On a Heritage Toronto tour of lost breweries the guide said this was THE best brewery in Toronto. I arrived ten minutes after they opened and shortly after the whole place was rammed! I sat at the bar and the bartender gave me great info about each beer and chatted about the cherry (kriek) lambic style beer on the menu, and she really was informed about the Belgian style process. I enjoyed the casual vibe and will happily return."}
{"text":"I've been to Bellwoods more than times I can count. This place is without a doubt my favourite brewpub in Toronto and quite possibly my favourite brewery in Ontario. There's nothing like sitting out on their patio on a sunny afternoon and people watching on Ossington. To me that's something everyone in Toronto should do at least once. Get some fries and a glass of Witchshark and it's pure bliss."}
{"text":"The best! Top notch! If you like hoppy get the Witchshark! The fucking best!! All the beer is deeelish! The food is solid too! Great meat and cheese spread, fantastic fried chicken with this dope-ass banana dip! It's all awesome! Atmosphere, drink, food, service. All of it A+++! The best!!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I am not a beer person.  I don't even like beer.  To me all beers at the LCBO taste the same, beery and I never understood the whole North American obsession with beer.    The first time I came with friends from out of town no less because they heard of this place.  I would have never gone myself (see note above).  They ordered beer, I ordered a cider I think and we shared some food which was good but not I would say extraordinary.  Better than typical bar food for sure but I'm guessing people come here not necessarily for the food.  What made an impression on me though was the interior (never been to a brewery before) and the choices of beer available.    I made a mental note and suggested to a friend to come try it out as someone that appreciated beer much more than me could possibly give an objective opinion on the beers.  So last summer after visiting the Pan Am games, we decided to walk up to the brewery late afternoon and found a table on the patio.  My friend ordered a beer, me a cider and ordered some food to share.  They had a variety of beer called Jutsu and my friend tried hers and said I had to try it.  Since I was at a beer brewery, I figured what have I got to lose?  At worst, I waste $7.  The description for Jutsu describes it as fruity, citrus, melon.  I'm like whatever.  Every wine bottle label I've ever read says the same things.   So maybe I had too much sun that afternoon or I was drunk from my one cider but I actually tasted the things in the description!  This isn't beer.  It's beer mixed with fruit juice.  My waiter assured me that it's just beer with the usual hops, yeasts and grains and it's no accident and like any good recipe, there is an ingredient list but the proportions are unique and different recipes lead to different results.  So my very first beer that didn't taste like beer.    Tip - order the fried chicken.    Disclaimer 2 - I'm still not a beer person.  I don't like 99% of beers.  To me almost all the beers at LCBO taste the same.  I'm so glad that the LCBO carries so many different kinds of craft beers that don't taste just like beer."}
{"text":"Besides the long wait to get in, it was an interesting experience. Great beer and good food! I'm specific on what I like to eat, but I went out on a limb by trying some duck heart. A really cool atmosphere with a live in house brewery available to the eyes. They were very accommodating and the service was awesome! Overall this was a great experience! If your going to attempt this place I strongly advise that you go early. Its a very popular place. Make reservations if you can in advance."}
{"text":"Great beers from top to bottom of the menu. Very reasonably priced beers for casks as well. Service however was terrible. Put our names down to sit downstairs and just watched as others that walked in took your seat  then was told no one had moved. If you can get a spot out front then it's worth the trip. If you're told to wait for a spot then don't bother."}
{"text":"Great beer. Tried four of them while I was there and they were all fantastic. Also enjoyed the meat platter with a side of fries, very tasty. A word to the wise- the platter (when I went) was very adventurous, which is great for me, but may not be for everyone! So inquire as to what they're serving on it before you place your order if you want to be sure :)"}
{"text":"Amazing summertime place to chill outside and pound some microbrews! Small interior but still worth your time if it's too cold out.   Only complaint is the bartender was hitting on my date while inside otherwise would give 5-star rating haha. Way to go douchebag!"}
{"text":"The bartender soured my experience; they were apprehensive to serve me a sample of a beer. You're a brewery... should be used to it. Sad."}
{"text":"What an amazing little brewery/pub. Admittedly, I did not try any of the food, but the beers and the ambiance were fantastic. We were seated on the patio, and despite the fact that it was packed, it did not feel overly busy. In fact, it felt quite intimate and cozy - perfect for date night, or a night out with friends.  As for the beer, I had the Monogamy Columbus and Wizard Wolf Pale Ale served as draughts. They were quite hoppy, with Monogamy being hoppier. Both were tasty, with my favourite being Monogamy, as it had a bit more of a citrus/orange taste. My girlfriend had the Paper Tiger Pilsner - very different from your typical Pilsner, but tasty nonetheless.  Overall, I would highly recommend this brewpub to anyone looking for a nice, relaxing night out, especially on the beautiful patio during the summer!"}
{"text":"Not sure whether it was the (absolutely revolting) sourdough beer that did me in, or the cheese and charcuterie board (upwards of $30 for a couple of pieces of thinly sliced meats and cheeses).  Either way, I woke up at 3 in the morning, violently ill.  You know what's worse than c. $40 for a pretentious pint and an underwhelming charcuterie board?  Getting food poisoning from the same.  Avoid.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I met a couple friends here in the summer and we grabbed a spot on the patio. This update to my previous review of Bellwoods Brewery is bringing down its star rating from a 4 to a 3 because of a couple things..  My friend ordered a light beer and she said she hated it. She had me try it and it literally tasted like someone had washed the cup with sunlight dish soap and didn't rinse it off! Maybe it was one of their beers with that citrusy flavour but it was taken to the utmost extreme that it was gross. I suggested she send it back but she didn't want to so I never found out what the heck was up with that.  We ordered the vegetarian platter that had things like olives and other pickled vegetables, bread and dip, and fried zucchini flowers. Nothing on that platter was that tasty. The olives were just weird tasting and I usually love olives. The zucchini flowers tasted like they had been fried half an hour before they were served to us and the hummusy dip had no flavour.  Perhaps these things were one-offs so I'm not going to demote it to two stars, but I was so taken aback by this experience considering how good it was the first time around that I had to amend my review of this place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed at all with the meagre lunch menu but since it really is a brewery first and a restaurant second, this place gets 4 stars for awesome beer and a great patio. Fully worth the visit for beers but don't come hungry looking for a meal."}
{"text":"A few of us came to Bellwoods on Thursday, March 9th around 9 pm. Bar was busy but we were more than happy to wait for a table as we've always enjoyed coming there. The hostess, however, was not very friendly. She was quite short and very dismissive. We were first on the wait list and had been waiting 10+ mins for a table, which, again, was totally cool. A gentleman came in at this point and asked if his waitlist request was still valid. As I was next to the list, I could see that his name had been crossed off. The hostess then put his name back on the list and ignored our looks of confusion. After a few minutes and without her talking to us, I approached her casually and asked if that meant our waitlist request was now longer because this man had come back. With no apology, she said yes and walked away.  I've worked in the hospitality business for over 12 years and would rarely consider writing a review of this kind. The hostess was super unprofessional and not to mention dismissive. If there had been an explanation or even if she had addressed the issue, I would have totally understood. Instead, she ignored us standing right next to the waitlist and doing nothing to hide that we were now being pushed back. Hey, we all have a bad days but this wasn't a welcoming experience. We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Top drawer service. Our group ordered almost everything on the menu and shared. The only thing that wasn't excellent were the fish cakes which were overly salted.   Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Bumping this place up a star as a recent trip yielded not only some of the tastiest beers I've had in some time but a really good chat with some of the staff about their plans for the future. No I'm not telling you what those plans are so you'll have to go talk to them yourself to find out."}
{"text":"Great brewery/restaurant. 5 stars for ambience. 4 stars for draught beer. Only had 5 of their beers available, but they had guest draughts and bottles as well. 3.5 stars for food. The food was good but I would have loved a more extensive menu and some items that were larger plates for 1 person. That being said I loved the falafel wraps and the presentation was very well done."}
{"text":"Been going here ever since it opened, Bellwoods is one of those rare breweries that manages to brew consistently outstanding beer and interesting and fantastic food. The service is excellent and the menu reasonably priced for the quality.   Im a sucker for the chatuterie, but don't be afraid of the duck hearts, they are a smoky, spicy, chewy revelation.   The retail store is the only place on the city to take home one of their brews. They change constantly and Donkey Venom (sour porter) and Catherine Wheel IPA are my current favs."}
{"text":"Horrible service with average beer.. Not worth the time or money. Me and my 7 friends would never come back"}
{"text":"I love this place, as do all of my out of town friends who demand we go here when they are here (haha)  The beer is phenomenal. I am a dark beer drinker, myself and I really like their dark. However I have tried much of their selection and I have never been disappointed. It's a fair price, too! Grab a sample selection, it's great! The location/atmosphere itself is also great in any season. A patio that opens into the brewery has several picnic tables that you MAY end up sharing with other folks, but it's fun, don't worry. It's worth it for their beer! In the cooler weather when it's all closed up there is room indoors, and there is a sweet little lofty area where you can overlook the interior and get a great view of the brewing equipment. Neat.  I sometimes have trouble picking something to eat here as I am a vegetarian but don't let that deter you from the beer. My meat eating friends love the selections.  I have never had bad service here, but the other night was exceptionally great! Our server was pretty much the cutest/funniest server ever. She was so enthusiastic over everything. I wish all of my servers were like her, hahaha I wish I knew her name so she could get some credit for making people's experiences fantastic. :)"}
{"text":"Yes, I know this place is well known for its beer...but this review will focus on the food here! First, the positives - our server was great (friendly, attentive, and helpful).  It was raining out and even though the patio was heated/covered, nobody was out there so we also opted to sit indoors.  LOVE the ambiance, decor and everything about the look of this place!!!  The fries were amazing. Loved how they were seasoned and I probably could just come here for fries and beer (which is probably what I'd recommend).  The dishes we ordered came out hot and fresh and were pretty tasty. Now..the things I didn't love...the porkchop for two is cooked to medium (I think that's what the girl who dropped it off said)...I found this weird, as I always thought pork needed to be thoroughly cooked, no pink inside.  Maybe it was all in my head but I did not feel that great after eating this lol.  The brussel sprouts were drenched in butter. They tasted good at first, then it became too much.  The polenta was tasty - my first time having this but probably a good idea to share as it was also very buttery and rich so after a few bites I didn't want anymore. Glad we were able to check this place out and I think we would return but more so for after work drinks and fries!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 5:30pm for a drink and snack. (Not really a sit down meal place) Had two very good beers! Home brewed and delicious, however we had no idea what we were getting. Decided to go with the fries (delicious) and bread and vegetarian dip (very good too). We didn't get the cheese platter or meat as we saw them come out for other tables, and it seemed like $18 and $23 for not alot of food at all (4 small pieces of cheese and some bread).  Otherwise it was great, as we got in right away and the atmosphere was very trendy. Will be coming back for some beers with friends.  Oh and don't go by the times on yelp. They open at noon on weekends and 2pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"Tasty beer & food, humble & hospitable. I can't believe the flavor and friendliness packed into this small place! If I lived near here, it would be my go-to spot. Each beer -Wizard Wolf, Paper Tiger, Farmhouse Classic & Toil & Trouble- was food friendly and enjoyable. The Canadian cheese board was full of all-stars from PEI & Québéc. The Welsh Rarebit had the delicious addition of wild mushrooms. The green chorizo with potatoes, cabbage and fresh pecorino was satisfying. The wild leek/ricotta cavatelli with morels and lemon butter was mouth watering and great with the beer. Too bad we didn't save room for dessert! The staff were all attentive, friendly and laid back which helps in the small quarters. Though very busy, we were seated quickly (5-10 min) and it somehow didn't feel crowded - we could actually hear each other easily over the crowd. Great spot - will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer and good food. What else do you need in life? Everything about Bellwoods Brewery works. The environment is intimate, the staff are friendly and of course, the beer is delicious. One of the best experiences in the city. Ill be back."}
{"text":"The only reason this is a four-star review is because they took the Duck Hearts off the menu. How could you do this to me, Bellwoods? Bring them back!  Otherwise, this place is perfect. I've been here countless times with friends, and we always have an awesome time indulging in Bellwoods' beers (they keep wining major awards for a reason) and countless meat and cheese boards.   The service is also phenomenal - one night, in December, we were loitering on the picnic tables outside (where it's the patio in the summer), waiting for a table.   A server came out and saw us freezing our asses off, so he went in and put up the patio roof and turned on the patio heaters just for us. And then he brought us beer. A+++++.   Have been here for the guided tasting with their brewers as well - I believe they happen Monday and Tuesday nights. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I just want to say that the five stars is solely for the beers - I've only tried a few things on their menu and they seemed pretty good, if maybe a bit overpriced (although I think they have a new kitchen and a new chef?), but writing as a total devotee of hopped, sparkling fermented barley beverages, you owe it to yourself to try their beers.  Most of their higher ABV selections are world-class, but my favourites probably include the Witchshark (Double IPA), Hellwoods (Russian Imperial Stout), and Lost River (Baltic Porter).  The garage-front patio is cool in the summer, and the seating and washrooms have been fairly limited, but I heard they're expanding (or maybe just did?) and that should help the lineups.  Also, the bottle shop (which has been functioning as a pop up) is supposed to go full time soon too.  Can't wait til next time I make it back over to Ossington.  Oh, but be warned that they close kind of early - 11 pm Sun-Wed, and midnight Thur-Sat - so don't intend to bar-hop your way here..."}
{"text":"Great beer! Didn't get a chance to eat here but after sampling several breweries in Toronto Bellwoods had a best beers."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and romantic, one of the most beautiful establishments I have visited in the city. The ambiance is wonderful and the beer oh my goodness. I am not a fan of IPAs myself and had a look around on the extensive menu and tried some of the things on tap when I went the dark cherry ale and the brettle head, the most delicious beers I have ever tasted, the cherry ale was made with dark niagra cherries, and a burnt chocolate it was delicious. The brettle head was made with an exotic hop from Australia called galaxy hops and they had a very fresh fruity flavour the beer almost tasted like mango because of the hops it was delicious. The menu is extremely limited, I enjoyed an incredible cheese plate with my husband not only was it beautifully presented the cheeses were fantastic and it was served with a jam and this incredibly rare raw mint honey the honey alone makes this cheese plate worth the price. I love this place just don't come here expecting your normal pub fare and it's a bit crowded seating wise so hopefully you like people :)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. Despite long line-ups, they were very accommodating to us and our baby. The beer is excellent, and I strongly recommend doing a taste of all the beers rather than a pint of one; you get a sense of all the products and you don't really need more than a taste (although witchshark is amazing!!). The food was small but exquisite. I still dream about the rehydrated peanuts, which tasted something like water chestnuts.  Dessert is quite small, but the staff warned us and we got 2."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after many attempts and have to say it was worth the wait.   Came on a Sunday around 2:30pm and only waited about 15 minutes for a table. In the meantime we ordered a beer and sat outside on the patio until it was ready.   I ordered the Monogamy which I had tried before from the bottle shop. Still as delicious as ever. We also ordered some snacks (fries, salumi, nuts, and bread) all tasty and reasonably priced.  Overall efficient service, fun atmosphere, and delicious beer. Can't ask for much else. The cherry on top was how low our bill was. We didn't realize they have  a \"witching hour\" (aka happy hour of sorts) so our beers were basically half price. Awesome."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: dim lighting, feels very much like a basement bar. Awesome artwork on the walls.   Beer: wide selection,  good for people who enjoy all types of craft. Session ale as well as stronger happier varieties available.    Food: Menu sounds interesting but it's more of a snacking/sharing type of place."}
{"text":"The beers are fuckin' awesome! It tastes like Vermont finest products. I really like the massive hops in the pale ale and IPA. I recommend the shit !"}
{"text":"could it be the best beer in ontario? it very well just might be. the staff at the brewery and restaurant are great. the food, following the snout to hoof trend, is uninspiring. btw the kitchen decides how to cook your steak you are paying for. but don't let a poor kitchen with delusional self-awareness take away from the greatness that is bellwoods beer!"}
{"text":"I was traveling from the US and came to this place on a tuesday night with a few of my friends, the place was full which is a good sign. This brewery is really awesome. The selection of drinks was great, they had this framboise, a raspberry beer that was so good. Some other great beers also that I don't remember. The ambience is great, the patio is very nice, perfect lighting. Anywhere you sit in this place you are basically sitting outside which I like. Crowd seemed people in their 20's and 30's. Only negative about this place is I feel the prices were expensive, beers were around 7-9, but they are special types of beers so I wasn't too upset about that. But we ordered the cheese and bread, which was 18 dollars for literally 4 pieces of cheese and 4 pieces of bread; some of the cheese was gross also. Overall I recommend this place if you want to try some new different beers, save the money for food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Beer is ok. Atmosphere nice. Salami VERY thinly sliced -- so thinly that you could put it into a glass frame. Their bread and butter (5$) tastes just like cheap margarine... so either they have shopping blindness, or have serious issues preparing butter."}
{"text":"Beer fans' must-go place! Their beers taste so unique and refreshing. Some fruity flavors but not sweet at all! DRINK SLOW....dont drink these beers like you drink Canadian or Coors Light. Their beers are over %10.   I didnt expect much about their food but omg everything tasted so good! We tried some tuna dish, kidney pot pie and something else i dont remember the name. They tasted so gooood!  There is always a lineup. The first time i went here in September i waited for about half an hr. The second time was in first week of November on a very freezing day. Our group waited for an hr... we were dying.. ppl who didnt want to wait were getting seated in heated patio but we didnt want to sit there. So we waited for 1 hr but it was so worth it cuz the food and their authentic beer were amazing!"}
{"text":"Beer was absolutely outstanding. Some of the best sour beers I've ever come across in my travels. The food, however, leaves a lot to be desired. While our food was delicious, the portions are *tiny*. I'm talking like 3x less than you'd expect for what you're paying for. Even the bread, which is complimentary at many restaurants costs $5 for 3 small half slices. My wife and I are healthy eaters, and our average meal is pretty light. That said, after the chicken pot pie, the fries (which are the best value thing on the food menu), some bread, and the bratwurst, we're probably still going to need to get a meal elsewhere.   Can't stress enough.  Beer here is EXCELLENT. I'd go somewhere else for food though.  Get the dark sour if it's on tap. To die for."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite patio on Ossington! If you can get a seat it's an awesome place for pints and people watching. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food but I loved the vibe."}
{"text":"Excellent home brew beers, friendly and knowledgable servers - plus a damn great place to hang out.   Go to Bellwoods, go now! They also sell some of their fine beer next door to go.  I haven't had anything to eat there, so I can't weigh in on the food just yet."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers and bites. Sat on the charming patio out front with candles and flowers. Perfect for people watching. Beautiful decorations, felt like a homey cottage. Heat lamps outside for the cooler nights."}
{"text":"Love it here! I've always wanted to give this place a try because I always drive pass it and it's always looking fun and full of people. It's a very cute and hipster looking resto/bar and the vibes were great. Our server and the rest of the staff were extremely kind and patient considering that my friends and I came in close to last call. They had great choices of beer for very reasonable prices and I believe most were exclusive at the Bellwoods which is cool, can't really get them anywhere else! I have a feeling this may be my new go-to spot for summer. I dig the open restaurant-to-patio concept of the place. Can't wait to revisit!"}
{"text":"Patio was nice but it's usually too busy. The beer is decent but expensive. Will be more enjoyable once the cool factor deteriorates."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I absolutely love this place. Everyone here has been friendly. There is plenty of parking on the street which is great. There is usually a line-up so come early if you have a bigger group. The samples are great and they change up their list often (from what I was told by the server). A friend brought me here and I in turn brought a few other friends. I'll be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Bellwoods is not only a brewery but it also has a small restaurant and bottle shop. I had dinner here on New Year's Eve. We had no problems walking in... they do not take reservations. The space has a very romantic feel to it.The lights are dimmed low and there are plenty of candles all around the room; perfect for a date! We sat upstairs which is a large balcony that overlooks the dining room and brewing area. To start we obviously ordered beers. Which are very reasonably priced. I had their award winning Wizard Wolf which is  a delicious pale ale, really refreshing and easy to drink. My boyfriend had the Grizzly Beer which is a brown ale. This one was way to bitter for my taste. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers to share. We had the bread and salumi. The salumi board was larger than we expected. It probably had 24 pieces of 2 different types of meat and it went really well with the whole wheat bread. We also had the fried chicken that came with a banana pepper hot sauce and corn relish.The chicken was delicious,juicy and again generous portions(4pieces) Last but not least we had the Arancini (rice balls)with marinara sauce. Apparently the balls had foie gras in them but I couldn't not taste it but still really enjoyed it. Overall the food was solid and the service was great. I would totally come back here for a beer and snacks."}
{"text":"Best beer in Toronto and super busy as a result.   On the negative: the clientale can be on the young and yuppie-annoying side.   But the positives outweigh the negatives: the servers are generally friendly and knowledgeable. And, of course, the beer...  Can't wait until the 2nd location which might exist in the same fairy tale ending as a completed York U subway station?"}
{"text":"most of their beers are IPAs which are not my thing. but the ones i had were flavourful. the fried chicken is just ok and is really just a sandwich"}
{"text":"there is a small percentage of businesses that very much deserve their success. the atmosphere, the service, the ambience, the beer, all very much bar-setting. only one problem: due to their success and popularity, there is frequently a wait to get a table, and sometimes in summer, they have struggled to keep up with the demand for takeaway beer from their bottle shop. the good news is they're going to be expanding to serve us better. go bellwoods!"}
{"text":"Very tasty beer. Dimmed lights. Relaxing hipster music. little pricey though."}
{"text":"I do love jelly king (even the seasonal varieties)! The food is actually quite good - the pierogies were amazing. However, I find this place to be a bit pricey (said pierogies were $15 for 3 ).  If I'm on a budget this place is a no-go but if I have some spending money I'll definitely head over."}
{"text":"No matter the season, Bellwoods Brewery is a bit magical. In the fall and winter, the lights are low and you can sit up in a lofted seating area, overlooking happy diners and the inner workings of the microbrewery. In spring and summer, their white picket fence patio is the cutest thing and hottest spot in the world. It's so cute, you wonder why it hasn't been done more before or been made mandatory along Ossington Strip.   On a more recent visit, we had great success with our ordering! My sister is pescatarian, so between the two of us we demolished a ceviche, cheese plate, rye berry salad, heirloom tomato and halloumi salad, and a corn on the cob. Loved every bite, save for one overdressed salad. Hey, it happens. The presentation was summer indulgence on a plate across the board.  Service is very personable and efficient in my experience. A couple times that I've been, we did receive a twinge of seriousness from the kitchen. The first time, my friend asked for the herbed fries on a plate instead of in a bowl and got denied. The second time, my sister and I asked if they'd cut the massive corn on the cob in half and again, they were not down. All not a big deal, but worth nothing that ordering is likely not going to be a two-way street.  Lovely staff though, and one did recommend that it's significantly easier to get a patio spot when you're just a twosome. The quote was something like, \"don't bring all your friends\". Keep it chill, guys.   For beers, I usually fare light so I am a big fan of the Cat Lady IPA and the Wiazard Wolf pale ale. Oosh, I can't get enough of their beer glasses and branding. Even the descriptions on the menu sing to me.   Come sail away at Bellwoods Brewery!"}
{"text":"Loved the setting (open air) and brews!  Fun/chill atmosphere, great for a date or anything really.  4 for 4 thumbs up for the beers that I tried.  The sours were a double thumbs up special to moi!  Chicago - approved!"}
{"text":"I need to take a moment to properly explain how stunning the food was here..  I tried 2 or 3 of the beers which were all lovely but the FOOD was the main event i was least expecting.   I had bread w/ butter that was somewhat sweet and super fluffy,   i had the incredible garlic fries which knocked my socks off..   and finally i ordered the fried chicken which might be up there as one of the best things i've ever eaten~  not even joking,  i was blown away!  Incredible..."}
{"text":"This place serves up the best beer I've had in Toronto. And, they have really tasty snacks too. Ossington was in dire need of a beer that actually focused on quality drinks (though there is a very special place in my heart for the dive-y places up on Dundas like Unloveable and Red Light).  My only issue with it is that it's the victim of its own success, it's just always so busy. And, as great as the patio is, there's almost never seats out there.  One thing to note: the tables outside are communal. So, if you're not into that kind of thing, you've been warned.  Overall, one of my favourite places to grab a drink with a couple of friends (especially in the summer) if we can get a seat."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breweries I have tried in Toronto!  It has a great selection of delicious beers and gives a very good description of them on the menu.  We ordered a plate of the garlic fries to accompany our beers, I highly recommend these delicious crunchy things!   There was quite a wait when we arrived which is understandable for a Saturday night at such a great place. We were seating in the upstairs area which is a balcony overlooking the bar. The atmosphere here is quite romantic with low lighting and candles on each table.  I was expecting a huge bill as it is in a very hip lovely neighborhood but the price is very reasonable!   The outside seating looks like a great place to enjoy beers in the summer and i cannot wait to go back.  They also have a store right next door where you can buy their beers in bottles along with posters and tshirts etc."}
{"text":"Amazing beer but soooooo expensive. Food options also expensive and nowhere near as good as the beer. Skip the brewpub and go straight to the store to buy your beer. Take it home and pair it with your favourite munchies. However, if you're a single gal and want to meet a hipster fella go to the brewpub and enjoy. I've never seen so many plaid shirt, bearded men with man buns EVER!"}
{"text":"Loved the beers I tried and the food was delicious. The artwork and names of their beers are great and add to the great little brewpub feel. Will definitely be returning next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here twice. Once with a young saucy lad in the summer and we sat at the top floor overlooking the brewery. I squinted at the menus scrawled at the giant chalkboards, ordered a Farmhouse Saison. It was nice and refreshing.  The second time was this winter with a group of Plain Clothes Hipsters and we sat outdoors on the \"heated\" patio that was not actually warm enough to be comfortable. I ordered a few glasses of Table Beer (quite addicting) and Wizard Wolf (not my favourite). The fried chicken with banana sauce was interesting. The duck hearts tasted like spicy sausages. Overall, I enjoyed the somewhat unusual snacks.  I also had some great conversations with other patrons while in line for the bathroom. Sweet experience."}
{"text":"Best local brews in Toronto. Every new release is an event. Friendly staff at the bottle shop. Always busy in the restaurant, but that's to be expected of a quality establishment in a trendy part of town. Delicious beer, that can't be emphasized enough."}
{"text":"5 for the beers, some of the best craft beers ive ever had (founders, russian river, yards, brooklyn brewey, pretty much up to par with any american craft brew)!!! 2 for the service, ive been treated WAY better in spots with worse beer and food...and if it wasnt for the beers being as good as it was i woulda left sooner than i did... ;) :* :) be easy jawns!!!"}
{"text":"Garages aren't just for cars, random lawn junk, and crap that you want to forget about... they can be transformed into a local brewpub hot spot.  As expected on a Saturday night, there was a line-up. They have an awesome patio and if you are a fan of micro-brews, it's worth the wait.   There was only two of us, so the hostess offered us a seat at a communal table and we wouldn't have to wait. I didn't think the communal table was a table for four. So, you feel a lot more pressured to talk to your table-mates. If they are cool, it's alright and fun...  We ended up sitting next to a loud and obnoxious pair of dudes. I tried to tune them out, they were going on and on about relationship nonsense that you really don't care to hear, especially if you are on a date. We kept drinking and thankfully they left.  The next pair seated next to us was a new couple. They pulled their chairs beside each other and did their own thing.  Anyways, if you are here on a date, I'd think twice about sharing a table.  It's hard not to compare this place to Duggan's. Bellwoods has a good range of IPAs, no longer offers the Berliner Weisse, but has everything to satisfy whatever your beer palette fancies.  One key difference is that Bellwood's is seriously disappointing in the food area. But to be the fair, the grill is not available past 11 pm and it's only the bar menu we tried.  The cheese platter ($18) was 4 tastes of cheese.and lots of bread from Woodlot. The platter lacked in presentation and was served much warmer than it should have been. * Brie de meaux was too runny and oozy. * Grey Owl may have been one of the better cheeses, but because it has this dark-grey-dirt coloured rind, you have to serve it so it doesn't look gross.  It tastes good though but looked like cheese that was run over by a truck. * Ciel de charlevoix was good and creamy. * Aged gouda was the only hard cheese, hard to slice but tasty  The charcuterie board was completely the smallest board I have ever seen. * 6 small pieces of salumi... what, from a baby pig? * ... WTF roasted peanuts? * Olives still had pits, damn you. * Duck liver was very... potent, so I hope you really like liver and bitter. ... More of that bread. Completely not worth $15. What a disappointment.  We would have stayed longer if we weren't still STARVING.  It is a cool space-- the hippest garage on the block, I'll be back for a few pints, but I'm eating dinner elsewhere first!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a local brew while in Toronto and were wowed!   We are from Charlotte NC and have at least 30 microbreweries within 30 minutes of our house so we are very spoiled with good beer and Bellwoods delivered.  We ordered olives and local bread and butter to munch on while tasting and we both agreed they were some of the freshest olives we had ever had and bread came with a delicious sundries tomato butter.  We tried the Jelly King sour which had just the right amount of pucker and was very well balanced and the Skeleton Key a high gravity Imperial stout that packed a very smooth punch for a high gravity beer.  Atmosphere was great, we will definitely be back if we are in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Bellwoods Brewery over labour day weekend.  I thought for sure there would be a long wait for a table but was able to snag a couple of seats out front right away.  The picnic table seating is fun but can be challenging to maneuver in and out of depending on your outfit.  It also means depending on the size of your group you may be at a shared table.  Our party of two sat with another party of two.  Service was friendly and servers seemed knowledgeable about the beer.  Its's a nice patio for people watching on the Ossington strip and the beer is great.  If you get hungry for a snack, order the fries - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Bellwoods has a cool atmosphere but I hated the beers :( They have a patio with a door that can open and close depending on the weather. Ample seating with an upstairs as well. They have a big menu for a brewery with both lunch and dinner options. didn't order food but the corn on the cob looked delicious. A friend and I got a flight of four beers and I didn't like any of them. They were all light golden beers, didn't look like they had any amber or darker beers on the menu but maybe that changes throughout the year. There were plenty of people there so guess I'm just the odd ball out."}
{"text":"I haven't visited all breweries but this is what memorable ones are like. Friendly service, good atmosphere, unpretentious beer loving staff, great food, better beer.   It's rotating selection would be hard to comment on here, and other apps have a great community to rate beers, but just get there first knowing that whatever is on tap is great."}
{"text":"It was really different than anything I ever had before. The brewery is inside the bar. The whole atmosphere was so different. The vibe was good though.  I had smoked mackerel, chicken liver mousse and boneless fried chicken wings. Everything had intense flavor to it. The mackerel had a rich cream flavor that I really enjoyed. The chicken liver mousse and bread was great. The mousse combined with garlic made for a great spread on the bread. I usually dislike the taste of liver but it had the perfect seasoning and the spread was nice and smooth. The chicken wings had a nice sweet kick to it. There was a honey drizzle. The onions were really sour though but it was good overall.  Go for the experience. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing spot nestled in a cool neighborhood. Rustic decor, with loft seating above. We sampled a variety of IPAs, all as described - juicy east coast styles: jutsu, witchshark, Roman candle. Roman candle was our fav! Our waiter was super friendly and gave us other taphouse recs while visiting the city. Nothing else was quite as good or refreshing as this little spot.   Now they just need to make their way to more US beer fests so we can get more!"}
{"text":"Patio atmosphere on the weekends, with a good rotating selection of house made brews make this a solid regular spot.  On a good patio day, you see dozens of people lining up outside waiting for the patio to open at noon.  And for good reason too!  The brews are definitely up there in quality, and the patio is great for people watching, and seeing all the interesting motorcycles parked outside gives you a taste of the Ossington go by you.  Tried all 5 in house brews that they had as sample glasses at the time, and would recommend the Roman Candle for a not too hoppy IPA, and the Farmhouse Classic for a most 'vinous' beer experience, with fruity notes, and no hops at all.  Look forward to bringing some of these brews home from their shop, but with patio season coming up I may just stop by for a pint instead."}
{"text":"Small microbrewery in Toronto with a great atmosphere! Great place to hang out with friends to grab a drink. There's a pretty awesome beer selection, but my favorite is the jelly king!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday afternoon by myself. There was a pretty long line with 2-3 larger parties ahead of me. The seating hostess was really nice and kept apologizing that she couldn't seat me earlier. Waited like 15-20 mins I think.   Sat at The bar. Ordered the double IPA and the Imperial IPA. They were both amazing.   Cheese board - 3 types of cheese, plenty or crostini, honey, apple, sour cherries, cherry jam. All delicious.   Green beans - ragu was really good. Tomatoey, and paired well with the beans (and the cheese plate for that matter).   Ambiance is amazing. Awesome open patio, plenty of hotties running around, male and female. It was the first place I went when I got to Toronto and I was like intimidated by the hotness haha  Only thing lacking was the service. My beer tender was female, don't really remember what she looked like. Brown hair. Glasses. I know I was by myself and maybe I'm not approachable? But she wasn't very friendly. I asked for the IPA and had forgotten the name (there were a few on tap) and she was like \"which one\" just like made me feel dumb. She never made an attempt to suggest any food or beverages. I was totally willing to drop some stacks on food, but I didn't like that I felt kind of ignored. Like I was taking up a seat for too long. Maybe she was having a bad day bc it's not like she was laughing and smiling with everyone but me, though she obviously knew some people there and seemed to get along with the others working there... Idk. I travel alone and go to many bars and breweries and I don't think it's too much to ask to be greeted with a smile or a sentence or two of conversation.   I get it, the place is cool. But I'm pretty sure we all know that there are other cool places I can go to spend $50 on small plates and a beer."}
{"text":"Patio/ambience (in the summer): 4.5/5 (cute, unpretentious and rustic chic)  Food:3 -3.5/5   Beer:3.75:5  Value:3.5/5  Overall: 3.75   Repeat: Perhaps in the summer, if in the area. Have to line up, no way around that."}
{"text":"One of the prettiest patios in the city. Not only is it a patio but also a brewery- the two go hand in hand well on a day with great weather. This place is open strictly in the evening and not open during the day, regardless arrive at 5 or early or you will be waiting for a seat! Patio seats aren't guaranteed as the influx of customers is constant and patio is granted on first come first serve.   Affordable and unique foods (5-8$ applies $ 12-18$ mains), however the main attraction here is of course their beers. What I like about this place is they offer 4oz beers ranging from 2.50-4$!! No free tasters but it's worth the small price if you get curious. You're seriously going to want to try all their beers , they're unique and there's something for everyone's liking. They also offer delicious ciders and wines, and kombucha for non alcoholic drinkers but these are pricey ranging  from 8-20$. I tried 4 different beers here , all of which seemed to taste the same but some hoppier than others. Majority of their beers have a fruitier base to it which I enjoy greatly.   Food wise- everything we got was okay at most. All plates were romanced well in he menu but did not deliver in taste.  I had the chickpea salad which lacked flavour. I would NOT recommend the squid as it was highly disappointing- bland. And the cod sandwich was not anything amazing. The appies are better thank god! Would recommend the flat bread which had the most amazing dip & the deep fried tofu was excelled as well.   4 stars because the service was VERY underwhelming. Our server never smiled and didn't seem to like her job. She was not enthusiastic and did the bare minimum. Absolutely disappointing for a place with so much potential. However this won't stop me from coming back as the other servers seemed nice and the place is quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got a sour beer (he wasn't a fan but I liked it!) and we shared the bread with the daily butter which happened to be leek butter. The bread and butter were sooooo good!!! And inexpensive. It took us a bit long to order and for my boyfriend to get his beer, which was his only complaint. I took away one star for the decor, because for the prices of the rest of the sharing plates and stuff you'd think they'd have more comfortable seating than just wooden stools and metal chairs. But if you can look past that stuff this place is really a winner."}
{"text":"When I first came here back in 2012 it was because someone said they have a great patio. I guess a patio which gets no sunlight is still a patio but meh!   So coming back again recently for dinner it just confirmed what I already knew and that it was just another overrated Ossington venue more inclined towards the hipster crowd.  I know already this place is known for the beers but not being a fan of IPAs or hoppy stuff there was not much for me to choose from so I gave up. Although beer fans will love this place.  There was not much seating downstairs, didn't get a look upstairs but it might explain why it always seems so busy here. So me and 2 friends were seated on a communal table. Really not my thing when going for dinner.  The menu was fancy but limited. My friends loved it and ordered a range of items. I went for some fries with Rabbit Sausage.   The portion of fries was too big, overcooked and although the sausage itself was great the rest of it was dry and bland.  I would probably come here again if it was a friends choice but nothing really to drag me back."}
{"text":"Microbrews, hip digs, and heat lamps outside.  The atmosphere is very conducive to good times with friends and the beers are consistently good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This very cool brew pub on Ossington is the closest thing I've tried (so far) in Toronto to Montreal's Dieu de Ciel as far as a good beer-drinking selection and experience - though the two places couldn't be much different. In contrast to DDC's cozy little bar, Bellwoods is a big, open space with gleaming brewing equipment and white walls that only make the place look bigger and more open.   We were there on what had to be one of the last nights that the (white picket-fenced) patio was open, which left the brewpub open to the street, which created a neat atmosphere.  Although my favourite beer was the Muggleweisse, I also tried the Hellwoods, the Roman Candle and the Witchshark and enjoyed them all.  Although the food looked good, we had just come from dinner and did not order anything, but I approve of a menu that's so obviously aimed at snacking with drinks. Since I'm sure we'll be back for drinks we'll have to try the food in the future, at which point I'll be sure to include an update. In the meantime, definitely give this place a try.  NB: Bellwoods warrants a five-star review because it's obviously a place to go to have a few beers and maybe a snack, and it does that very well. If they were trying to run a restaurant I'm not sure they could pull off the fifth star (though they'd get a solid four that could easily be bumped up to five with an exceptional menu) but I approve of their specialization."}
{"text":"A brewery with a line - always a sign that something good is in store. In the middle of a hot Toronto afternoon, my friends and I baked under the sun and cooled down with some suds. We had just come from lunch, so we did not indulge in the treats on offer, but it is a diverse and intriguing menu.  My favorite part of the Bellwoods menu was the reserve bottles on the menu - it's always a treat to experience a brewery's older beers that they put that extra bit of effort into. Having bottles from other local providers is a great show of the community that makes craft beer great.  I had two beers while I was here: Jelly King, a dry-hopped sour, and Monogamy, a single-hop Pale Ale (with one of my favorites, Mosaic). Both beers were great examples of the style, although I think Monogamy could've been even more expressive of the Mosaic hops.   This is a great spot on a summer day or, well, any day. My beer glass did spend a few unfortunate minutes empty, but the staff were running around on fire, so I'll forgive them that. While it seems unlikely, perhaps they'll distribute down this way someday."}
{"text":"Why does Toronto love Bellwoods? As a newcomer to the city I don't know. The beer is okay, but personally I find it quite floral in aroma. If that's your thing then that's fine but most of their offerings are pretty much along those lines. As for getting food who knows. I've tried going twice and there was a 1+ hour waiting list to get seated. There is an outdoor seating area which they'll seat you at (even in February) but that's really only a perk if you're not at all hungry and don't mind drinking outside (fantastic in the summer, miserable in the winter). But still, there is far better beer in Toronto."}
{"text":"After three visits over a couple of years, I've been amazed how consistently bad the beers are here, sometimes verging on undrinkable.  Nobody I have ever been here with thinks the beer is any good, either.  On the last visit, the service was also ridiculously snooty and pretentious.  The success of this place seems to be based on a conspiracy of people who don't know beer and people who think they are all terribly hip and special.  I am never going back."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I could recommend to just about anyone. Amazing ambiance, service, food and beer. If you want to sit on the patio just be smart and plan ahead, those who complain about waiting for a spot clearly just assumed a patio this cute was going to be empty for the taking!   Food We ordered the bread and butter, garlic fries, nduja and ricotta, fried chicken and chorizo verde. My favourites were the nduja and the chorizo (my friends raved about the garlic fries and chicken too though!). The nduja is essentially a crostini with a delicious combination of sweet, spicy and salty topping. The chorizo was also very good, loved the potato and cabbage stew that was underneath! Only thing I would comment on is the bigger dishes are a little hard to split between many people given they are more like plated entrees. I am impressed the food all paired really well with the beer, that says someone in the kitchen is equally passionate about their food and the beers (a rarity for brew pubs in the city). We paid about $27 (tip included) each between 5 of us and def. weren't left hungry!   Drinks Almost everyone ordered the Omerta (?) which was a slightly fruity, hibiscus noted brew. It is still quite a bit hoppy like most of Bellwoods' beer so you do need to like that \"beer\" taste. With that being said it might not be for everyone! They do carry other brewery beers too so i would ask for a recommendation if you aren't a big beer drinker to begin with.   Service Double thumbs up! I find service so hit or miss in Toronto but I'm glad to see something so hipster seeming doesn't have that cold-shouldered vibe. I asked the ladies who greeted me if I could put my name down for a spot on the patio while I waited for my friends to arrive. They seated us inside and moments after receiving our drinks they came back to let us know a spot was open on the patio. We did have to ask for odd things like napkins and cutlery that you would think would come as soon as any food came to the table but a small hiccup is forgivable once those trusty forks arrived!   I'd highly recommend this for groups of friends or a date for any beer/food loving pairs, especially during the summer season when you get to enjoy the patio space. However, the inside is equally charming and fun! Big fan of their branding and artwork, really gives it that handmade unique quality."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my Bellwoods visits but it's mainly for the beer.  If I had to rate the food on a standalone basis, then it's a 3.  If I include the beer selection and atmosphere, then this place easily moves up to a 4.  In terms of food, I've tried a few things now like the sausage, fries, and fried chicken and everything was adequate.  This is not the best place for dinner but the menu options are good enough for nibblers as you work through the beer menu.  Now onto the important stuff...Beer!  This place offers a very well though out beer list that zeroes in on quality. I think Bellwoods is a decent brewer and they always present some nice tap selections.  I find their stouts/porters are pretty well done, but their IPAs and saisons are less consistent but never seem to be below average.  I really do love their European and Quebec offerings.  Some of them get pricey but it's great to find a place that offers some of the highest quality imports along side their own local brews. I've tried some European beers which I could not find anywhere else in the city so it's always nice to open up your \"beer horizons\".  The list seems to keep changing in offerings but not in terms of breadth & quality, so keep up the good work!  As others have noted, this place can get very busy.  I personally like coming here on the early side before dinner or on the late side and I usually get in.  Regardless, this place is not to be missed by beer aficionados.  It's not only one of the best beer bars in the city but it's surrounded by several great dining options in the area."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery is the ultimate summer patio spot on Ossington. Bask yourself in a hipster ambience and enjoy local craft beer, and shareable plates.  I came here with an old friend last week and we had fun snacking on delicious fries, sandwiches, and kale salad while having our beers.   The restaurant itself is very welcoming, and service is fast as well. I loved the ivy walls, and the outdoor picnic style seating.  I couldn't have asked for a better Sunday afternoon, and you'll be sure to enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"Le spot à Ossington pour consommer des bières locales! Le Bellwoods sert pas moins d'une vingtaine de variété de bières locales le tout accompagné de side dishes comme des frites, olives et tartines salées. L'endroit étant victime de son succès comptez 15 à 30 minutes d'attente pour avoir une table le week end. Le plus : la boutique next door où vous pouvez acheter tee shirts et des packs de bières Bellwoods !"}
{"text":"Fantastic patio and great vibe with communal seating on a mix of large picnic tables and regular sized tables. Interesting selection of beers to chose from.   Very impressed with the food - fried chicken was likely the best I have ever had but portions are not large and menu is expensive. However, that comes with the atmosphere.  Great place for hipsters.   No place to hang your jackets."}
{"text":"Happening place that looks like it was converted from an old garage. Nice beer 'take out' area."}
{"text":"In the category of breweries with sit down food service, this is the best of the best. Not only are their beers really inventive, varied, and delicious, but the ambiance, service, and food is excellent. We had a few small plates and a few large plates, and were really impressed with the bold flavors and creative spins on each dish. The grilled squid was the standout dish--tender to the point of melting, paired with a bright and flavorful romesco. Also had local bread, pickles, fried chicken, and broccoli salad, which were all varied in texture and flavor (and all delicious). Service was friendly and quick, without being obtrusive, and the ambiance was energetic yet mellow (moderate-energy music, moderate noise level, soft lighting, full but not packed). Really loved their sours and imperial IPA. I will 100% be back here."}
{"text":"Beers are really good! Service was really bad. Cool patio."}
{"text":"I believe I have inadvertently discovered the secret ingredient in Bellwoods Brewery's mediocre beer: cheer.  This is the only logical explanation for why the unfriendly, humourless staff so intently  sap joie de vivre from their customers until their souls are bare like strip-mined moonscapes."}
{"text":"My friends and I were waiting for a table to come up at a restaurant down the street when we stumbled upon this place for drinks.  The patio was full so we went upstairs which I thought was just as great.The dim lighting and candles created a warm ambiance to the otherwise very industrial decor. The drinks menu is extensive and they carry a number of imported beer in addition to their own brewed beer. When we asked, our waiter recommended a light spicy beer. We loved it! The name escapes me unfortunately.   We were only there for 20 minutes. I'd definitely go back to have more than one glass of beer."}
{"text":"Stop by here the other day and picked up a 4 pack to bring home.  Again a bit pricey, 4 beers came to well over $20.  Had a couple over the last few days and while I did enjoy them, I'm not so sure I would head back for more.  It has made me curious about other brewery places and I will be hitting them all to see how they compare"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Ossington strip. Wonderfully diverse beer selection (although I am not a fan of the allegeldy \"Berlin-style\" sour beers), and fancy eats. A brewpub is not typically a place you would want to take a date, but if your date like beers, this would be it. The food is expensive, and not particularly generous, but it is very good and matches well with the beer. Nice patio, weather permitting."}
{"text":"I can see myself propped up at the bar for years to come. The vibe in this place is inviting and the woman who greeted us last night was pleasant and so accommodating. She got us a place at the bar and we were immediately served by a great bartender who was helpful in guiding us thru their extensive beer menu.  Throughout my evening there, they were helpful but not pushy and when a friend decided to pop on by, they made room (Even though it was pretty packed up)  I will definitely be finding myself there more often as the beer is good and the atmosphere is cozy"}
{"text":"I would normally give this bar  four stars the only reason I did three is because of the long wait times. Otherwise. The beer selection is very good and the snacks they have to pair with the beers is great."}
{"text":"Service was kinda meh and me and my boys ended up under the stairs clutching the small wooden drink tables. The Beer was quite nice. I had the Grizzly Brown Ale, An American Style brown lager. Had a nice body to it. I would like to try the food but hope the service improves."}
{"text":"Totally different vibe than the Ossington location. I assume, since I've never gotten into the Ossington location, because I never want to line up.  This place only has chips to eat, no food, so it's mostly a bottle shop, but with the ability to sample the beers or grab a glass before buying.  The woman behind the bar was super friendly and helpful, and we sampled many beers (at first she was giving us a sample each, then we asked to just share one sample).    Highlights included the freshly made Fruit Helmet (like a juice!), the easy drinking but high ABV Whiteshark, and the chocolatey Lone River."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to grab a beer on a hot summer day or night. The patio area is buzzing with energy, and it has a great ambiance. It can get pretty crowded during the summer, though it's not surprising considering this is one of the ossington strip hot spots.  Be prepared to wait if you have a big group. Didn't get to try much of the food, apart from the fries, which I would recommend."}
{"text":"This place thinks it's too cool. Hipster wana be bartender turned me off to the point that I decided to leave -  so in all fairness, I didn't try the food. Nor will I, because I will never go back.   Brutal"}
{"text":"I've walked by bellwoods many times, it's always packed.  Finally decided to stop in here for some grub and a beer.  First of all, I did not realize that this place is the 3rd best new brewery IN THE WORLD.  I tried the wizard wolf and grizzly beer.  The wizard wolf is definitely the house favourite.  It's a smooth, easy drinking, light pale ale and does not have the traditional bitterness.  The grizzly beer is the complete opposite.  A darker beer with an immense hoppy flavour to it that had a surprising sweet aftertaste.  Some of the beers on tap have alcohol contents up to 9%+ and as low as ~2%.  The food was decent.  We shared snacks - an order of bread, the salumi, fried chicken and a special menu was on tap which included duck confit arancini.  The portions were larger than expected (never a complaint!).  The fried chicken is boneless the batter is crispy and lightly salted - highly recommended.  Comes with a spicy sauce on the side and pickeled corn.  The salumi and bread came in generous portions, easily shareable by 4.  The low part was the arancini, but this is off a special menu so I'm not sure if they normally had it.  The tomato sauce was too thick and I found it had a bit of a re-heated taste to it.  The food menu is on the sparse side, but the reason you come here is for the beer.  The brewing is all done in-house and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the beers were $4 on our bill.  Service was excellent.  The waitress was friendly and eager to point out items on the menu or tell us about the beers.  This would be a great spot to start off in with snacks and drinks, then deciding if you want to hop to another bar on the ossington strip later."}
{"text":"How do you make already delicious fries better? You toss them in clarified butter!!! Even though I only came for a drink and was already full from dinner across the street, I couldn't stop eating those fries with with garlic mayo. $7. So good!  We also had the apple fritter dessert, that I've been told is made to order. 5 deep fried apple dough balls of deliciousness drenched in melted cream and topped with apple chips. Hmm... Seriously, I had only wanted to come here for a beer!  And instead of a beer, I had a guest tap apple cider - it was like drinking down a glass of smooth apple juice. The stuff is dangerous.  The staff here are excellent. Super friendly, and they even asked us whether we wanted to change our seats to the packed patio after we had already been seated inside on a beautiful Saturday. I'll definitely be back for a whole meal - not just for a snack."}
{"text":"Ambiance is on point. Beer is on point. Food is on point. Neighbourhood is on point. This is a great spot to chill and have drinks. A great spot to come for dinner. There are a lot of other bars and restaurants around so you could jump around and binge on excess."}
{"text":"Everyone working there looked absolutely miserable and ordering a drink was a nuisance.  Beer was alright, but who wants to drink at a place with workers like this?  Bars are a place to have fun, not get ice grilled by the staff for  talking too loud.  We each had a beer and left.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I visited Bellwoods Brewery on a chilly Saturday night. While the only seats that were available were outdoors, it wasn't a problem because the heat lamps were there to keep everyone warm.   Bellwoods Brewery is a fun place with a great atmosphere. I know that the communal tables aren't for everyone, but I love it. I came here with a couple of friends and we ended up talking to the people next to us. Get cozy... they can get quite packed.  As for the beers, they were great. I had the Wizard Wolf which tastes exactly as they described it- very citrusy with tropical hints of flavor.  Overall, I had a great time here. The music isn't overly loud, everyone is pretty chill, and it's a great place to sit down and catch up with people. +1 for the table decor... candles and wild flowers always set the mood."}
{"text":"Such a good spot. The fact that this place has 3.5 at the time of this writing make me disappointed with fellow Torontonians. Place has got an amazing atmosphere, a blend between rustic and modern loft. The patio is fantastic, the beer is absolutely delicious, the price is mid-range. It's a great spot and credit to the city. Glad its there, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hooray for beer. Horray for the microbrew movement. Horray for Bellwoods!  The only bad thing about Bellwoods are the lines. It's definitely a popular place and one can see (or rather, taste) why once you it down and have one of their local brews. Brewing a variety of beers on site, Bellwoods offers up some delicious beers, including my favorite IPA in Toronto. Sitting on the patio in the summer while sipping on Witchshark IPA is something not to be missed if you're an IPA lover.   The food menu is unimpressive and from what I saw of the plates the food is average at best, but this is a brewery, so lets review it for what they're here for - beer.  5 stars for the beer, just be sure you're willing to wait a bit in line!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking to find a place like this is Toronto every time we visit there.  He is a professional beer brewer in the San Francisco Bay Area, and likes to check out independent brew pubs wherever we go.  Bellwoods was spot on!  Their style of beer is very comparable to what we get in the SF Bay, where there is a brew pub in just about every neighborhood.  The brewing system itself is exactly the one he uses at the brewery where he works.  The service was great, really nice, friendly and fast.  We visited twice here during the 10 day vacation, we enjoyed it so much.  We made a point of getting there early, 5pm on a weekday, 12 noon on the weekend, with no problem getting a table.  Parking on Ossington was no problem either time.  The food was slightly upscale for a pub, but affordable.  We had our 12 year old son (picky eater) with us, and he made it work by ordering the fries with the bread and butter side.  Doesn't sound like much, but they were great quality, and he was satisfied.  My husband and I shared the meat platter, the cheese platter, jalapeno corn, duck hearts, and mortadella sandwich.  It was all very good!   In fact, my husband went back to his SF pub raving to the head chef about the duck hearts.  If I still lived in Toronto, I would move to the Ossington neighborhood, so this could be my local pub.  It's really that good."}
{"text":"Bellwoods is possibly my favorite brewpub in Toronto. Their beers are all good and the food is awesome. Last time I was here with my fiancée we shared the rye berry (kale) salad and I ordered the Monogamy. Both were worthy of our return."}
{"text":"This is a review for the beer, not the actual location.  A short while ago I had a little unintentional craft beer exchange with Jennifer K in which I hit up a couple locations which were local to me and as a kind gesture Jennifer had sent along a bottle of Cat Lady and Witchshark back.  I'd not had either these beers before and I can pretty much say I've never had a Bellwoods brew that I knew about prior to drinking these two.  I had the Cat Lady first, and it had a full flavor as an American style IPA.  These are the kinds that I can drink more regularly.  I enjoyed this one of the two more even though as it's the milder of the two.  The Witchshark was not messing around.  It was hoppy and bitter and not as clear.  This was the stronger of the two both in flavor and alcohol.  It was strong, one of the stronger ones I can say I've had.  I'd rank it right up there with Robohob and Immodest for that.  Both beers were good although I did enjoy the Cat Lady more, I'd buy both again given the chance.  I'd look forward to trying more next time perhaps of the non IPA variety."}
{"text":"It's always nice to be able to review a place you have visited many times over a period of time and give it a full five stars. And I think we have been here enough to earn the right to this full-throated endorsement.   We've had beers here on a hot summer afternoon on the packed patio, as less lucky wanna-be patrons stood in line, tongues hanging out panting and eying our cold beverages with a combination of jealousy and barely concealed hate.   We've been here on a chilled but sunny November afternoon for a last of the year outdoor pint when we were the only ones brave enough to do so. We watched as a cavalcade of youth, clad in their Canada Goose jackets, hurried inside out of the 'cold'. We sneered, mocking their youth with the only thing we have left at our age, true grit.   And over this past winter we have, more and more, just rolled in for a bite to eat and a hoppy glass of suds. And of our samplings the food here has been a cut above the rest. Way beyond the burger and fries pub grub that gets slung around in this town and more substantial and less precious than some upscale bars, Bellwoods strikes a nice balance. Favorites are the Rye Berry Salad, Duck Meatballs (they come with a fresh and tangy tomato sauce), and seasonally last year, grilled corn on the cob. Just yesterday we also tried the Queso Fundido, which as a decadent dipper (fluffy crispy chicharrones), was a real treat. Plus the fries here are really great - and they get to you hot - which is an important but sometimes overlooked detail.   We like a good IPA and they always have a couple on the beer menu. So far we have really enjoyed them all. Last night RUNES became a new favorite. The brewery seems to like innovating and pushing the flavors of their beers, without getting silly or being self-consciously sensationalist. So beer... YAY!  The staff has always been very friendly and the service is great. One of the first times I went here it did seem somewhat chaotic but it was a super busy afternoon and I have not seen this happen again since.   The only drawback is that this is a popular spot, especially now that the weather is warming up. I guess if the patio is full you can always get a six pack at the bottle shop and take the party elsewhere but the place is fun and worth a few minutes in line."}
{"text":"Fantastic eye catching in your face patio with it's own \"grill before your eyes\" BBQ  and the type of beer selection things like The Three Brewers wish they had. That should be enough to get you in here.  Although, you should expect a line up if you're there on a weekend evening.  Throw in friendly staff, a bites selection catered for seamless integration with drinking and you're set!  I really enjoyed my visit here, even though the 3 of us chose to share a table with 2 other men over going upstairs where they have only \"bar type\" seating. It was a little weird to sit next to 2 strangers but neither group got in the other's way and we did choose that option anyway.   The beer menu does offer a good variety, and the ones I tried were good enough that I'd want to return here to try more of the beer offerings.   I would say that the bites menu is a little bit more pricey than I would like, we ordered the cheese platter, salami and bread which went great with our beers, I was tempted to try the \"chicken heart\" for just $4, but my two drinking companions were not quite fond of that. Maybe next time?  The BBQ sandwiches on the menu were unavailable as the BBQ does close relatively early but if you want snacks the menu does give you a decent choice to keep your beers company.   This ended up being a great start to our evening at Ossington and would recommend it take that spot on your list of an \"Ossington Crawl\" as well!"}
{"text":"Once you get hooked on their beers there's no going back. In the summer they are really busy but during the winter they seem to slow down.. which is perfect since they have a nice selection of stouts to warm you up! Tip: Not the best place for food and drinks but its great for only beers."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Definitely try to go at 2 when they open. There is a line outside almost all day long. We got there at 2:30 and had to wait about 20- 30 mins before getting a table inside. It was too cold for the patio.  Beer: I lucked out with a couple of good choices. Had the Monogamy Mosaic, and the Witchshark. Monogamy is a smooth pale ale.Witchshark is interesting. Lightly bitter, with a smooth aromatic after taste. It's odd, but the notes of mango really isn't bad...who would have thought?!  Menu is decent with plenty if sharing options. The fries are great, and I love that they have fresh bread and thyme butter. I didn't really try too many things yet.  I wish they had some sort if beer tasting flights... I really would have liked to try out a few. I didn't ask about this, but there wasn't anything written in the menu."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great beers! They need cushions for bar stools tho..ouch!! We never tried out the menu bc we ate down the street. Food looks great and we'll definitely be back for that"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and beer makes this place totally worth it, however, the service is what loses a star. We came here on a Saturday night and our waitress took a while to come greet us and get a drink order, then they brought my husbands dinner out about 10 minutes before mine...."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery is the patio you wish you and your friends had.  Located in the hip and beautiful area of Trinity Bellwoods, Bellwoods Brewery serves up a series of locally brewed favorites and gourmet pub foods. Although there is a 30 minute gap between lunch and dinner where food is unavailable, the dinner menu is worth the wait.   Highly recommend trying one of their grilled cheeses or panko crusted pork sandwiches. They source their bread from a local bakery in Kensington, and it's unreal."}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to think about this place at first, but I think the best word to describe it would be hipster.   The bar area is teeny tiny and it's a challenge to be comfortable unless you like being cramped up against the person sitting next to you. Thankfully there was an open seat next to me, but you may opt for a table if you want some space.   The namesake of the place happens to reference beer, and it is VERY good. This brewery was recommended to me by another one on the east side of town, I'm told they are known for their barrel aged beers- and the \"Skeleton Key\" barrel aged porter I had was one of the best that I've ever had. Truly exceptional. I also tried their double IPA which was also very good.   The food menu doesn't really have any traditional brewery grub in it, they're mainly small plates they are designed for sharing. Definitely not a comfort food menu either, but it is all over the place. I had the seared ahi tuna that was served on pickle chips with a horseradish sauce with fresh dill. It was delicious, but unfortunately at the $19 they charge, didn't quite fill me up. Probably good to come as a group and order a few plates to pass around and nibble on- but if you're looking for a full meal, you may have better luck elsewhere.   I also paid a visit to the bottle shop they run next store, the beer selection is reasonably priced, but save your money on the clothing. Most of it has their bell logo, which if you're from the States, could easily be confused something that came from a Philadelphia brewery with the Liberty Bell as their logo."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer, delicious food, relaxing ambiance (speaking more to my recent, winter and spring month experiences, sitting inside, upstairs). This is the very first choice when thirst and hungry strike at the same time.  The inside looks tiny here, but there is an area upstairs that overlooks the front of the restaurant and the back brewing area. Service is always great up there even though you feel like you're tucked away in your own private alcove.  The beer list changes a fair bit and I appreciate the detailed descriptions on their menu card. I've tended towards trying the IPAs and have loved them all.  While Bellwoods gets a standing ovation for its beer, the food has to be applauded loud and long. This is not just a brewery with food, these are really well thought out and well prepared beer accompaniments. I wouldn't be surprised if people come here for grub who don't order beer. Me and my DC have mostly always ordered the same items on every visit and they've been consistently excellent - the kale and ryeberry salad, the duck meatballs - sometimes the fries, and the corn cobs when they're available... all are unique in their own way. We tried the queso fundido last time - surprisingly scoopable and so decadent with the chicharrones. Portion sizes are spot on.  We've only really had one food \"miss\" here - the smoked bratwurst (which seems to have disappeared the lamb sausage with fennel curry, which we really loved). It is difficult to eat and not worth $14. Everything else on the menu is elevated though it's pretty simple fare, and this one seems a spin on the, IMO, now-overly-prevalent genre of fancy-not-fancy junk food."}
{"text":"Bellwoods not being AT LEAST a 4.5 is an absolute travesty. Ya'll Canadians be sippin' on some crazy \"maple syrup\" if you think you have anything less than a world class brewery in your backyard. My wife and I have such a high regard for BB that the last time we had a six hour layover at YYZ, we made it a point to leave the airport and stop at two places - Kitten and the Bear (seriously ridiculous tea, jam, and buttermilk scones) and here.  Like Scott Pilgrim and his bass, Bellwoods specializes in getting funky. If you can make a beer style sour, they've probably done it. Sour stout? No Rest for the Wicked brings the bretty blackness. Barnyard saisons your thing? Farmageddon is your hayride. Like your wild ales with a side of fruit? Barn Owl, with versions brewed with Ontario peaches, cherries, and apricots, or Grandma's Boy (plums, plums, and more plums) will have you thinking you're sticking to your New Year's resolutions. If it isn't sour at Bellwoods, it probably has an abundance of hops in it. Staples like Witchshark (which might just have my favorite branding of all time), Jutsu, and Roman Candle are almost always on and for good reason...they're delicious and beautifully showcase Bellwoods's expertise in the pale ale/IPA space. Special shoutout to Bine Hunter, their dank and juicy fresh harvest pale ale, which happens to be one of my favorite wet hop PA's in existence. Sometimes Bellwoods just can't decide if it likes bacteria or hops more, so they brew a beer with both and out pops Jelly King, a dry-hopped sour ale that brings the best of both worlds. In the \"Other\" category sure to excite beer nerds around the world, Bellwoods also makes some bomb, big, barrel-aged imperial stouts. 3 Minutes to Midnight is like drinking boozy, chocolate cherries and Bring Out Your Dead brings out your sophistication with a thick, chewy stout aged in cognac barrels. Mmm...indubitably.  The Ossington brewpub offers three ways to get your drink on. The first is the bottle shop connected to the main establishment where you can buy whatever fresh bottles they may have available for the day to take home. The second is on draft at the brewpub itself. The draught lines are usually dominated by pale ales/IPAs, which is fine, as that's what you want to be the freshest anyway. Lastly, Bellwoods always has a vintage bottle list to peruse for on-premise consumption. This is where I spend most of my money and where you can find year's worth of all the unique, experimental beers I listed in the paragraph above. If you aren't sold on the beer alone, BB also has some great bites to go along with your brewskis, and the service my wife and I have received has been about as stereotypically Canadian as you can get (read: polite), while oozing passion and knowledge for the beer itself.  As an American beer snob, I would kill for a brewery like Bellwoods to be in my city. As it stands, my wife and I constantly talk about when our next Toronto visit will be, and Bellwoods is one of the big reasons why. Canada continues to look better by the day (please let me stay next time)."}
{"text":"Bringing my brother drink one of the best beers in Toronto served by some of the most entitled, disengaged and unfriendly servers. As one of my coworkers says: it's like serving a delicious steak and mashed potatoes in a trash can.   Bellwood Brewery is one of Ossington Street's most outstanding businesses. Their beer is fantastic, and their facility is beautiful as it has its brewing section with the stainless steel equipment, an attic kind of area overlooking the restaurant and brewery, a bar area, and a very lively patio.   Unfortunately the servers are some of the most apathetic, unenthusiastic, disengaged, entitled group of people that the GTA has to offer. And the surprising thing is that they have managed to keep and foster this sever \"culture\" for the three years that I've been frequenting this place.   Why do I still bother? I guess that as long as the beer continues to be this good I'll continue \"eating this steak in a trash can\"."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and a local friend suggested we meet at Bellwoods. There was a small line when we arrived and the hostess let us know it would be about a 30 minute wait. At first the line moved pretty quickly but then it just stopped. It ended up taking just over an hour before we were seated. Most restaurants tend to over estimate the wait time to avoid disappointment.  We ended up being seating at a bar upstairs that looked over the tanks. I was a little disappointed that after an hour wait, we weren't even going to get a table.  I originally ordered a cherry sour which they were all out of so I settled on a different sour, the Jelly King. I was happy to find it was a very drinkable sour. For my second beer, I had the Jutsu which was even better. Great for anyone looking for a nice light pale ale.  The only food we had was an order of the Cripsy Tofu. There was nothing particularly special about it. It was a little too salty for my tastes.  Overall I'd probably give Bellwoods a 2nd chance but there's no way it's worth standing in line for an hour."}
{"text":"*extreme confession warning*  I don't drink beer. I know. I'm disgusting and should be sent to beer jail (which may sound great to you... not so much for me)   That being said, I love me a game of square peg in the round hole. Especially when it's as lovely as bellwoods brewery.   The staff are friendly,  prompt and frankly, cool.  The patio, even in 5 degree weather is warm and ambiant. We decided to sit out on the patio for our 6 o'clock lunch to watch the trick or treaters and dressed up puppers. And bc I can't let summer go. I can't!  I won't!    We ordered the falafel lettuce wraps and the duck meatballs from the perfectly balanced and just long enough menu, long enough to make me NEED to come back to try a lot more and short enough I know they are making this stuff with heart and spirit.   Reading their extensive list of beer, cider, porters and stouts... I was overwhelmed in the best way, the descriptions of each are fun and seem to give you a sense of the ride you are in for for each.   What really took me by surprise was the amazing super awesome non alcohol choices. Cold brew drip pilot coffee guys. For real.  Boylans soda in two flavours, FRICKIN Komboucha  (I'm talking at a brewery dudes, it was exciting. Bc I'm a nerd and it's great to be a nerd) my fave sparkling, eska. And as great as this non-alcoholic list is, this is where a half a star was lost for me (as well as for a food item, more on that later)   There was not a hot cider. Or... a hot beer toddy...   Now... I could be mistaken, and I will be picking the staffs brain a bit next time I go, but from my scan of the menu, there was only cold or coffee.   Nbd... just a personal le sigh.    Now the food: it's Monday,  I was going in light.  The BEAUUUUATTTAFUL (said like Jim Carrey, bc fuck topical) falafel lettuce wraps were a delight to behold in their tidy simplicity.  And the tahini was perfectly measured against the thin and delicate fermented turnip. The falafel was spiced just the right amount of rich.   The duck meatballs.... oh lawdy these hot meatballs are massive and scrumptious and a perfect foil to my eat light plans.   They are served piping hot, smothered in a nearly effervescent onion and tomato stew. It was so frothy without froth or bubbles... it melted on the tongue and the shavings of melted cheese and clumps of duck meatball were the only reason the sauce made it to your mouth instead of floating away.  The only two things to disparage are that the meatballs in their giant, savoury and triad glory, had to end. And the other is that by the end of the first meatball you do get a little overwhelmed by the salt. It's a very salty dish. (That's the other quarter star deduction, again a super personal reason so take that with a grain of substitute seasoning)  I will be back for a proper drink beyond root beer and eska.  Until then...here are some pictures of the beautiful foods I just ate."}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker...why do I like this place??!  It's the food! Food, glorious, food!  The menu is constantly expanding...just like the place itself!   Once they extend the restaurant it will be an unstoppable microbrewery churning machine!  My dining buddies love the beer; my husband adores the Bellwoods brews.  I adore the stewed lambs neck...so tasty and flavorsome. Not to mention the duck hearts...I cannot come to this place without ordering the small plate which has 4 dainty little grilled duck hearts. Bread is sourced from a local bakers. Pate is rich and delicious.   There is not a whole lot of seating room but it is worth the wait. Patio is small and super busy. As far as I remember they do not take reservations. Downstairs tables are first come and also sit anywhere policy so do not be surprised if you have other guests seated at your table.   Never had any issues with servers...always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Decided to go for beers on Ossington a couple weeks ago. Didn't know where we'd end up but as I googled best of Ossington and read on BlogTO about Bellwoods, we decided to check it out.   Walked past it twice. It's an old garage converted into a brewery so you see the white garage door as the front. Not what I was expecting.  We walked in, and wow the smell of cured meats greeted us.  A server welcomed us and said the bar upstairs was available for seating. So we made our way up.  It's kind of tight up there, but you can look down and see the bar and the brewing going on. REALLY high ceilings, cool space, candles and flowers on the wood tables. Very comfy.  We ordered the Weiss and the Toilet something or other. Fantastic beers. Ordered a few tapas (the menu is interesting), and we were really loving the potato and sun cholks on a stick. They were $3 each. We also ordered the crispy pork which was AMAZING, the liver pate and bread, and the salami plate. All were delish. They can add up quickly with the beer, so if you're ultra hungry, I would say be prepared to spend a pretty penny to eat.   Overall, the ambiance was great, the server was fantastic and I am guessing their menu changes weekly. I will definitely go back and try more beer and more tapas. This place is a great addition to the Ossington strip. Can't wait for the patio!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'd hoped to spoil my dinner by first heading to Nadege nearby for some desserts, but for me that experience was quite underwhelming and unsatisfying. Fortunately, Bellwoods Brewery came to the rescue on nearly every measure.  Unlike the typical American brewery site that I'm used to, which is more of an active warehouse that happens to have a tasting room but doesn't necessarily have good food - or any food, for that matter, besides occasional food trucks parked outside - this place feels more like a lively, upscale restaurant that happens to have a brewery inside.   As for their brews, I found the dry stout with cherries quite refreshing, and I positively chugged it down after a long day of touristy pursuits. The food was also an upscale surprise. This isn't run-of-the-mill bar food. It's all seriously good stuff. If you can see my photo below, the herb-rubbed porchetta with roasted carrots, creamy grits, gremolata was even more delicious than it looked, with the porchetta proving oh-so savory and juicy, the carrots adding a very crunchy texture to the whole dish, and the grits providing a soothing, satisfying foundation to it all.  Even more satisfyingly, while my dish, or everyone else's that I eyed, looked quite good, nothing was overpriced given the portion sizes or the apparent quality. Maybe my perception of the food and drink was skewed by an appetite that I'd primed up all day long, but when added to the lively ambience of the entire dining room and the engaging, but not intrusive, service, I was very impressed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally got to try one of the most popular brewhouses in the 6ix! After a half hour wait during dinner rush, of course.  That dampened things a bit, as well as the rain that day. But it was really all worth it!  My partner and I got the fries, spring salad, curried vegetable pot pie, and squid to share. We were comfortably full by the end of it all! The fries were really good! Sliced thinly like matchsticks. The spring salad definitely fulfilled my salad craving. The curried vegetable pot pie was both of our favourites. The squid was really good and palatable, but the lentils weren't our favourite.   The raspberry jelly king was super delicious! It's really tart though. So if you're really not into sours, stay away! Got a nice buzz going for me, but then again I am a lightweight.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience, minus the waiting in line."}
{"text":"When I rate a restaurant, I have trouble separating out the food from the service from the drinks. Overall, this was a great experience. The beer is excellent, the service good and the food was alright. Unlike other reviewers, I did not like the duck hearts . I found the menu very limited. That said, it was not expensive and if you like hipster viewing, lots of fun! My six year olds also enjoyed the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm going to conduct a little interview with myself so bare with me, I promise this will go somewhere (hopefully).   Sami 1: So Sami how long have you been into craft beer? Sami 2: For over 5 years now  Sami 1: wow that's a long time, how many beer types, styles and brands have you had?  Sami 2: Too many to count.   Sami 1: Wow! So what's the best Ontario brewed beer you have ever had?  Sami 2: Bellwood's Last Splash strong ale (Imperial IPA)   Sami 1: What is the best fruit beer you have had?  Sami 2: Well that would be Bellwood's Fruit Helmet (apricot and mango IPA).  Sami 1: Wow sounds amazing! What was the best smoked beer you have ever had?  Sami 2: Funny you should ask, that would be the smoked Berliner brewed by Bellwoods!   Are you sensing a trend?  I finally checked out this fairly new Toronto brewery before a concert last week and these guys are doing very special things. Their Last Splash strong ale (I believe it is technically an Imperial IPA) was the best Ontario beer I have ever tasted (it was a collaboration with former Dieu du Ciel brewer Luc Lafontaine). Their Fruit Helmet IPA was the best fruit beer I have EVER had, not too sweet with just enough hops and alcohol to balance it off, another masterpiece! I tried a sip of my friend's smoked Berliner and for a smoke beer (a style I don't like) it was ok. I had a sample of their Muggleweiss (sour beer) also and it was quite good, if I had a full pint I think I would have become a fan. My friend and I went to this place before a concert and it blew us away, so much so that we ran back immediately after the concert for a couple more beers! These guys are doing very special things and are willing to take risks by brewing more than your standard IPA/wheat beer/ stout. In that one visit they have truly become my favourite Ontario brewery.   The brewpub itself has an industrial feel, especially with the tanks in plain view. It is an intimate place with a large street patio, in the winter they will probably fit 50 people at a very tight squeeze. The upstairs bar is absolutely amazing, offers a great view of the restaurant and is good for people watching. They have about 8-9 of their own beers on tap (including a couple collaborations), 2 guest taps, and an extensive imported bottle list (mostly Belgian). Pints are in the $8 range; however the bottle menu looked quite pricey.   Food wise, I was not hungry at the time but still ordered their duck pâté, I have never had pâté before and can't say that I really enjoyed it; however being a pâté virgin I have no clue whether this particular one was good or atrocious (the bread it was served with was good).   If you are a craft beer nerd/snob you need to run to this place. They do not sell their product at the LCBO but they do distribute to some local bars and restaurants. My only complaint about this place is that the taps are rotating so I may not have another chance to try the Last Splash Strong Ale, but I am sure whatever beers they put out will be awesome. I cannot wait to try their upcoming Imperial stout! This place is easily in the top 3 to grab good beer in Toronto and quite possibly the best brewery this city (and province) have to offer."}
{"text":"Not bad. Nice atmosphere but lacks a dark beer. Could be the season but 3 ipa's and a few blonds. Bottle selection is great even if over priced. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The outside of the building looks like an inconspicuous warehouse with a dirt parking lot.  There are a few mismatched tables inside with a white picket fence separating the patron area from the brewery.  There were 4 beers on tap during my visit, 2 of which were sours. The only food they have was kettle brand potato chips.  I tried the Jutsu pale ale 12oz for $5.  It was good and refreshing.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"On our usual hunt for somewhere to stop and have a drink we decided to hit this place, a super busy neighboorhood spot. Luckily we didn't have to wait long for a table.  They brew their own beer here and I don't see why you wouldn't order one. I myself found their Monogamy (uses only one hop) down right delicious. So much so I didn't waver from ordering it a second night we stopped by. We did not order any food but dishes looked realz good being dropped off at other tables.  Most of the seating is outdoors at picnic tables and a few 2 tops. Other wise there is seating at the bar and a few \"inside\" if you don't want to get to much sun. There is also a partitian next door selling t-shirts, beer, and other items."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I'm looking forward to summer again just so I can sit out on the patio at Bellwoods Brewery? Well, it's the truth.   The bustling patio constantly draws in those who are walking by, whether it's to sit down and enjoy a drink or just to grab a bottle  (or four) to go. Lucky for me I live less than 100m and can go any time I please, all season round!  My favourite items on the food menu are the mussels and kale salad. Beer-wise I really love the sour beer they serve, but it's certainly not a beer for everyone! Bellwoods Brewery is a definite recommendation from me if you're into local beers and good eats! There are lots of surrounding bars and restaurants too if you want to make a bar crawl out of it."}
{"text":"Since I'm a beer guy on holiday vacation in Toronto, I convinced my Canadian family to bring us here. The brewery is located in the art & design district of Toronto so there are some cool vintage shops, artwork, and interesting establishments on the same street.   Bellwoods opens at 2 pm on Saturday and we arrived then because we had my 9 month old daughter in tow and we wanted to guarantee a table inside. They were very accommodating and even had a high chair for the baby. The inside of the brewery is small and there are not many tables in there although they have a small upstairs area and a small patio too. The first 2 hours they are open is the \"witching hours\" so draft beers are $1 off. We sampled several on draft at decent prices for Toronto (around $6 or $7 each) and tax included. For food the lunch menu is very limited but we had fries with sriracha mayo sauce for dipping which was awesome, a bowl of olives, meat tray with salami & prosciutto and bread with coffee butter. Some pretty good snacks for beer drinking and service was really friendly and nice.   The beers were all excellent: Grizzly Beer Brown Ale, Cat Lady IPA, Stay classy Session Ale, Toil and Trouble Dubbel, and our favorite was the Blitzen Saison. After we finished eating and beers, we stopped at the bottle shop on our way out where we picked up some Donkey Venom Brett Porter, Hellwoods RIS and others to go. 500 mL bottles are around $6-$8 each, which isn't cheap but not terrible either and totally worth it. Will definitely visit Bellwoods again and highly reccommend for fellow craft beer fans!"}
{"text":"Solid Beer in a very fun spot! Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Six of us beer fan friends from Buffalo came up to do one of the guided tastings that Bellwoods offers occasionally. I had sampled some stuff before from them, but not extensively.   We got their right at 5 when they opened and were ushered upstairs to the far end of the overlooking 2nd level. Billy was our guide this evening and he did an awesome job sharing Bellwoods' history, process, and future ideas.  The tasting dinner consisted of 5 generous samples and a tasting board of various meats, cheeses, olives, and other small selections from their menu. The board were meant to be split by 2 people, just and FYI in case you are coming alone or have an odd number in your group.  I highly recommend trying one of these tastings out. It was informative and fun.   Bellwoods beer is fantastic and I think no matter what your preference, and even if you aren't a big beer drinker, you will find something there that you will like.  You must go to the bottle shop next door. I can't believe the prices to get the 500ml bottles. I am still enjoying some of the 6 I got. I also love their branding and design for the bottles/merchandise overall.  In general, I would rate it as a Brewery and the beer easily as a 5, but the menu overall would keep it at a 4. I did enjoy the tasting menu overall with highlights to the falafel and the nuts. We stayed after our tasting to socialize, have a few beers, and have some food, but honestly, the menu was a little too high end. I would have liked a little more accessible \"snack\" foods to go with their beer. A couple of us just stuck with the fries (which were very good), but other than that, even if I was coming for a full dinner, there was only a couple menu items I cared for. I'd probably eat dinner elsewhere and then come here for the beer and a snack.  I definitely will be back for the beer!"}
{"text":"As a gluten-free goer, they had great selection of ciders and GF pale ale. The space is open and relaxed, bartenders are sweethearts and chill crowd (not a fan of hipsters but it brought me back to fun nights in my beloved Williamsburg)."}
{"text":"Wow! They've done a fantastic renovation of this old garage. It's kept simple and clean with nearly all white interior, with warm wood tables and chairs.  Great date spot, especially scoring a private seat up on the balcony overlooking the brewery. The lighting is great and romantic, with lots of candles.  I'd make this a before/after dinner spot though, as the food disappoints. The kebabs are a cute idea, but the execution seems a little lazy. Not that they were bad, just overpriced and a little too simple.   I'll definitely be back to try more of the beers. They were all fantastic, and our waiter had lots of great suggestions."}
{"text":"The very best (summer & fall) patio in the downtown core with a superb selection of local brews and tasty snacks. I take all of my out-of-town visitors here and I've always experienced excellent service.   Toronto establishments should take a cue from Bellwoods. It's always packed for a reason. And they have live music on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan.  My girlfriend and I decided to pop in for dinner and a beer on a Saturday night.  It was maybe 7 by the time we got there.  We were seated immediately which was nice.  The outdoor tables are all communal, which is a cool idea because you can meet some interesting people that way, but they are also pretty cramped.  Since they sat us at an empty 4 person table we decided to sit side-by-side in order to avoid getting scrunched up next to people we didn't know.  We thought this made perfect sense as anyone who sat with us would undoubtedly be more comfortable also.  Apparently this wasn't the case, as we were asked to switch how we were sitting when another couple showed up.  We politely declined for our own comfort (besides, we were there first) and the hostess looked at us like we were crazy.  They had a grill fired up which was cool but the food is super overpriced and the portions are tiny.  I think I paid close to $20 (after tax) for two chicken thighs and some pickled onions.  Definitely not worth it.  They were tasty, just not filling at all and not worth the cost.  My girlfriend got the pulled pork sandwich which was good but also expensive and a little dry in my opinion. Our waiter was really nice though and it was amusing to watch the guy grilling outside in cutoff jean shorts (maybe he was a never-nude?).  Finally, the beer.  We got a couple different beers, and while they were high in alcohol content, none of them actually tasted good.  The were like watered-down versions of good microbrews.  I'd describe them more, but it's just not worth the effort."}
{"text":"This is a little northeast of downtown and easier to get to than the other with a parking lot to boot. You come here to drink and buy beer and that's it. The other location has the food.  They don't have every offering on tap, but don't be greedy. It's a nice, out of the way place to hang out and drink. Then comb through their fridges and pick out some grog. Their IPAs are the way to go, Goblin Sauce, especially."}
{"text":"Bellwoods has 2 basic functions that stem from their brewery... One side is the bottleshop that you can get beers to go. The other side is the brew pub which has their beers served in accompaniment of various foods. I've had a review draft saved for over a year as I wanted to do a full review, but since another summer passed where I didn't stay for my beer indulgence, I'm moving forward with a BOTTLESHOP ONLY REVIEW.  So, what can you expect? Expect delicious beer, first of all. Bellwoods makes some of the best and most original craft beers you'll find in Toronto. All their beers have unique qualities and I've yet to have a beer that wasn't good. The bottle shop is open 11-11 every day and offers their tasty brews in 500ml bottles to go.   Bottles range from $4.50 to $13 depending on what is in stock. The rarer and more seasonal of the choice the higher it gets.  There are some more commonly found beers like Jutsu pale ale and Jelly King sour, but their more occasional brews like Witchshark IIPA, Farmageddon farmhouse ale, and this summers one off Mango IPA which steal the show. I'm not even really a porter fan but their Donkey Venom was one of the best I've ever had. Since the selection does vary so much from one week to another, you'll want to check out their website as that they always list on their what's available. This is how I'm able to plan my monthly bottleshop trips based around what appeals to me.  Genuine 5 star beer, but I'm sticking to 4 stars based on how hard it can be to get some of their seasonals before it sells out, and the fact that you'll spend more per bottle than most other bottle shops in the city."}
{"text":"Went here strictly for a couple of beers.    They had a nice selection of beers and a very cool environment to hang out in;  a converted garage (\"garage\" as in old car repair shop) with lots of stuff to check out on the walls.    Servers were top notch.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular here.   Good job guys."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  Went here on a week night, and got a table pretty easy.  There were 3 of us.   Had a lighter beer, a cheese platter (shared), and -- a homemade sausage!  Made in-house.  They get a pig from a menanite farmer up in Kitchener.   I was intrigued -- and it was delicious!!  To top the night off, I met John B the Portuguese Mad Rapper outside.  He roams the area rapping for people.   Bellwoods is cool.   I will be back"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance! Service was good - something that is becoming rare amongst bars. We only ordered drinks and pita bread so there isn't much to comment food-wise but I'd love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Went here again last night for my birthday because I wanted to try their food, the menu has recently changed. I got the panko tofu and it was pretty good, the tofu was great and the soup around it was ok.   My partner got the chicken wings and really did not like them, there was blood all over one of them and he described them as gooey. We sent them back because we weren't sure if it was blood or sauce so our server went to look at them in a better light, she came back to tell us that it was blood and that the wings were safe to eat but they would bring him more anyway and cook it longer. By this point he was really not into the wings and had lost most of his appetite so he asked her if he could change or cancel his order but she said that the wings were already in, which I understand butttttt will no one else order wings within the next 20 mins? I don't know it seemed really weird. They brought him a small $3 beer as a courtesy which I was also offended about, why not just a full beer?? They make their own beer so it's not like they're paying a huge markup to import or get from someone else...Or not charge for the fries or something? i don't know I thought it was just the cheapest gesture especially since they wouldn't cancel his order. Also it would be understandable for someone to not want to eat more of your chicken after having blood all over one of the wings soo... I just didn't think that it was handled properly.   That being said the beer is pretty good but we will definitely not be getting food here again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Did I mention the beer selection is phenomenal? Just checking. Been to this place a few times and they're very consistent.  Food and service have been on point. Small venue with a large patio. It's very comfortable with a relaxed pub atmosphere.  Always check the specials!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Ossington strip. I have tried many of the beers (which will always be changing), IPA, porter, Weisse, Belgian style, and all of them are great examples of their style. The menu seems very homey and simple, but it doesn't taste simple. It's really well prepared and delicious. The room is open and airy, the patio is going to be great. Expect a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I can only echo what other reviewers said. Great food, excellent craft beer and incredible ambiance. I loved the low lighting, wood details and indoor/outdoor seating. There was a slight line when we arrived but we immediately got a seat at the bar. This place was very busy, which was a good sign. We got a flight ($3/4 ounce draft) and tried the Wizard Wolf, Jutsu, Fruit Helmet and Witchshark IIPA. All were excellent. I especially liked the Witchshark and my husband loved the Fruit Helmet. The menu consists of bar snacks and shared plates. We only got the meatballs since we were planning to bar hop a bit. They were the perfect combo of pork & beef with just enough salt and fat to make you say... Yummmmmm. The sauce was also delicious, heavy on the onions.  The best part was out bartender, Mallory. She was beyond friendly and helpful. She said she loves working weekends because it's when she gets to meet torists. She wrote us out a list of restaurants and bars to try and pointed us in the direction of the next bar we should go to. What a great way to start our trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Great server, great liver mousse, great lCanadian cheese board, great ferments, great beer."}
{"text":"Best patio in the city. Doesn't even feel like Toronto when I'm in here! Hard to get a seat so come early. Great spot for a date or even a bunch of friends since they do have quite alot of space. Love all their beers, probably one of my favourite breweries! I also love that they have the Glutenberg IPA which was delicious. Food is really quite good. The fries are a staple and I recently ordered this amazing chorizo dish with coriander, potatoes and cabbage. Amazing! Some of the mains are a bit on the expensive side but they have not failed to deliver."}
{"text":"THINGS I LOVED  The Beer - Delish. I had the Monogamy and the Peddle Pusher. Worth the trip for those.  The corn on the cob - I ordered it because two of the other people I was with ordered  it and kept saying it was delish. They did not lie. It is by far the best corn on the cob I have ever eaten in my life, ever. Also, there is lime on it. Get it even if you are not hungry. It was so good I started thinking about how every time I make corn it didn't taste that good and how that is such a fail. I cook it on the BBQ and figured that might have something to do with it. Then when I left I saw that they were cooking it all on a BBQ. WIZARDS!!!! It's 4 dollars for 2 cobs which is fine by me. Otherwise the portions aren't huge but the place is a brewery that is their main fare. Don't expect otherwise, it's delish small portions to be nibbled on as far as I could see.   The decor - It's just nice...you're in a small brewery so it's very fun and makes you wish you were a brewer, just a littler.  The people making out upstairs - Behaind where we were sitting upstairs there was a couple blatantly making out. This kept me chuckling. It's not that type of place at all and it was a Monday so good work to them!  THINGS I DIDN'T LOVE  The service - I had actually tried to eat here three times before. The first two times I went I tried to get in and they were full. I asked to be put on the list and they wouldn't take a number to text or call while we went next door for a pint for 45 min. You had to wait outside (no chairs). Thats just silly, it would be just as easy to take a numero. The third time it was just too long of a line. Thats a good thing I suppose, i just think you could manage that better.  That coupled with the very nonchalant service made me not really love the service. One time I waited for a good 10 minutes at the door for someone to say hello and then they didn't even ask if we was there to eat/drink? It felt like I walked into a party I wasn't invited too. Not very sound.  That being said, I'm sure it's just kinks of opening, still rather new and I will deffo be back for the beer."}
{"text":"love this place! dating or hang out with girls!  i like ricotta cheese smt (kinds of Bruschetta) it was nice!  so many choice from beer selections (but pricy!) also u have to wait in a line"}
{"text":"Not much space inside, but the staff really make you feel like they are trying to help you in a way that isn't pretentious. The people are also cool, you watch people walk in and share tables, that's awesome.  The beer really is top notch. Sunday is cask days, went and they had two types of IPA's for the day. The waitress used some words that i've never heard used to describe beer, like 'efferescent'. What does that even mean?  The sunday $6 pint is a steal, every other beer on tap was at least $6.50. What's great about this place as it's so chill you see people go in and read! at the bar!  The best place to sit is on the balcony overlooking the bar. You see everything! From watching the pour, to the smells of the food from the makeshift kitchen, to what people are doing below.  Didn't try the food, looked quite simple. Although I haven't eaten here, I'd say this is one part that wouldn't be enough. It's simple, so it goes with the theme. But it may not really be a \"come for dinner\" type place. If I come back for dinner one day, I'll revisit this point.  Just come for the beer. And as the waitress tipped, grab a few to bring home in their retail store.  The one thing I've noticed after getting bottles at the store twice is their selection changes often. Wait too long and it's like the one you had last time won't be there again."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, great servers, great vibe. Beautiful patio area. They are also really accommodating about food allergies. An added bonus that you can purchase beer at the shop."}
{"text":"The Brewpub hours are different than the Bottleshop hours. The Brewpub's hours are from what I'm told dictated by the actual brewery operations not being able to coincide with the pub which is a backwards law here in Canada. Put some rails and designate a hardhat area and you can brew 24 hours a day and not have such limited hours.  100% I can see how this patio and roll up doors is the bees knees in the summer, but aint no one hanging outside in the winter.  They came highly recommended as a brewers brewery. Where brewers come to drinks. Owners Mike & Luke have the science behind things with biochemistry degrees. This is seemingly popular as Dillon's owner teaches biochemistry. Their offerings are imperial stout heavy with something for everyone. They also like saison/farmhouse wild yeast strains.   No growler fills, but they do guided tours that you can schedule, just not outside of business hours because of the whole production thing. I guess there is wiggle room to this.   Staff are ok, they love beer and they love working here, but I'm not sure they like customer service or hospitality. I had multiple questions that didn't get answered or I got a shrug implying tough luck.  It's not quite communal seating and it's very weird to have a lunch only menu on weekends when you aren't even open during lunch hours. 2-4:30 on the weekends is like Brunch's weird cousin of just snacks. It seems Canada love Chicken liver, mussels and brats because I'd say 1/3 of all the places I've eaten at offered all of these. It's a small menu, you can tell the chef made this menu on things they could prep quickly. All their dishes are plated very well and super appetizing and great for a brewpub, but if you are coming here to eat you might be disappointed. Chicken liver mousse needed some sweetness to balance, the cherries weren't enough. Beer needs a heartier pairing than cheeses, salads, snacks, but $14 for a bratwurst, come on guys. Falafal anything for $12, how is falafel $12 and duck meatballs $13. There are plenty of places to eat besides here, they are known for their beer. I'd barely call it charcuterie.   Décor is eclectic, European and bistro like.   Beers are good, the menu pushes things and it's fluid with the trends. Since there is no bottleshop separate account it's small (basically just a 5 foot by 5 foot counter) where you see the board, tell the staff what you want, they go and get it and you leave, not even a real coat rack so you get people hanging out and it's a mess. If I lived around here I'd pick stuff up all the time since they have limited hours in the actual place where you can eat and drink.   To me all that can be overlooked for day drinking on the patio, but it's biggest weakness' are like the cold light of day in the winter."}
{"text":"Small but delicious selection of hoppy house-brewed beers on tap and a larger, more expensive list of bottles as well. Seating is a little tight, but service is great and in the summer, with the front open, this place can't be beat. We usually sit at the bar for the best service.  As great as the beer is, I find the food to be consistently fantastic and priced reasonably. They change up the menu from time to time, so you'll always see something new, but I've never had anything I didn't love.   Get there early to avoid the line, this place gets busy as soon as the doors open."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for bottles to go for a while ('Stay Classy' is an amazing and flavourful light brew that will ferment beer haters into beer lovers), that I almost forgot they serve grub too on premise, next door to their beer store. The beautiful front patio is usually buzzing, but was hardly busy when I stopped by for an early weekend lunch.  When you eat here, you're not limited to just the stuff Bellwoods Brewery brews; their beer list is so extensive, it is drunkenly out of control. And if their rotation of own beers are amazing (which they are), well, I had no idea how amazing their food is too. That is, until I started hammering their amazing fries, meat boards and chickpea salad. The fries were an amazing crisp hit drizzled with parsley and clumps of fine cheese. And I should stop repeating the words \"amazing\" to describe anything here that will fit in your stomach; even in its simplicity, feels like they put as much attention to their food as does their brews.  Food is generally served snack bar/tapas style and in such servings. And yeah, it's in the thick of the Ossington hipster strip (indeed hipsters and microbrews attract like raccoons and compost bins), but ditch the hipster checklist at home. The place has a great casual social atmosphere and is also surprisingly family friendly. Happy waitstaff are waiting to provide attentive service with fun hot personality. It's a lovely place to eat indeed. And drink... I forgot you can get bottles of their stuff to take home.  {TTC: the sixty-third to Argyle St. If you are going southbound, the back doors of the bus should literally align with the entrance. Drunken bus-shelter-with-a-brewpub convenience!}"}
{"text":"Hello, this is Bellwoods' North York location. They have grown so much and produce such an endless expansive cycle of beers that they need this warehouse to keep operating. It also enables them to host large events (such as their recent Witchstock beerfest) that would be impossible to do at their Ossington location.  It's located at the end of a cul-de-sac in a large industrial area. Its relative isolative location makes it ideal to go to to snag a couple of bottles of popular suds that easily sell out in Ossington-land. Suck on that, hipsters!  Unlike in Ossington, there is no full restaurant operation here. But unlike in Ossington, you can head straight to the beer fridge and help yourself, however you have to ask upfront for the popular sellout stuff they keep behind the counter (eg. flavoured Milkshark series). Although they built a fancy bar in here, it primarily functions as a walk-in bottle shop, and one heck of a well-stocked shop it is.  It's not easy to get to, but not a pain to find either. It is within close driving distance to such places as the Castlefield Design District, Orfus Road outlets, and Yorkdale mall, which makes stopping here for a short visit a productive one if your plans in the area revolves around nearby shopping."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good vibes. Good garage. Corn looked cool but ya boy was too toxed for it. Stole some toilet paper cause it was better than what we had at home. Heard a dude talk about Fleetwood Mac. Beers we're fun to analyze like hipsters. Candles in Mason jars!! Came in with 18 year old (I'm 19, it's not creepy) and wasn't carded. Overall dank."}
{"text":"Bellwoods has great brews for every palate. Their food is tasty, but pretty pricey and the portions are on the smaller side.  The patio is fantastic, but it is hard to get a table and they do place patrons from different parties together. Don't like talking to your neighbor? Find a different place to wet your whistle."}
{"text":"A cool microbrewery situated in the middle of the Ossington Strip - some may find that it seems out of place... with many full service restaurants consisting of a front door, proper tables and a full menu, this location is an open industrial space - the space is guarded by a large garage door - large brewing tanks in the back, and tables running from the inside to the outside, white picket fence separating the patio and the sidewalk (so cute!)  The bar is situation on the left hand side, small kitchen area on the right, an upstairs bar which is considered as indoor seating, and a large BBQ grill at the front where the main hot cooked dishes are served (sounds awfully interesting but seems legit to me!).  On a thursday around 11, the place is packed - the hot hot heat definitely contributed to it. With a few people lining up, we were offered seats upstairs but felt it was too stuffy so we left..... .and then came back only to find out that this was probably the best option compared to other restos with small enclosed patios. And then luck struck because two tables at the front patio opened up and we ended up at sharing with another couple at a 4-top.  The menu is hung on the top of the garage doors and ever changing with their small plates and micro-brews. There are some special items so pay attention to the board as whatever is on paper may not be your only options. We already had a full dinner so came to check out some of their beers - my choice was the Boot Knife - This mahogany colored Belgian ale combines malt flavours of biscuit, caramel and chocolate with a fresh and earthy hop profile. Dark in colour but lightER in taste.... tasted a little bit of an amber / cream ale and it was very easy to drink and very tasty. For something MORE light on a hot summer evening - go with the White Picket Fence - A light and refreshing Belgian summer ale brewed with 50% wheat malt. Natural notes of fruit and spice are present in the nose with a light body and clean finish. It was definitely very refreshing with floral and fruity notes.  Curious to see what this SWEET plate tasted like, we ordered on to share - it was a porter cake with yogurt, apricots and greens. Served in a small ramekin dish - it was two bites of white cake with hints of beer, and small pieces of apricots. The yogourt helped with the moisture of the dessert and the flavours were subtle yet complimented nicely. Sure, $4 may seem a little pricey for not even a full slice of cake, but it was all I needed so I guess it was a good thing.  Overall - the place is definitely one I would come back to - creative, eclectic, flare, that is not easy to find in a busy Toronto city.... that's why my 3.5 rounds up to 4****."}
{"text":"Like hops? Here they are, regardless of style. Most brews are like blowing a pine tree come to life.   Great patio, be sure to order the mixed nuts. Excellent service.  Just be prepared to drink a more bitter mouthfull than my first paragraph.   I still recommend you visit often."}
{"text":"short review - this beer is so good that it makes my head explode... i'm kind of glad that there's always a wait and that i don't live closer, otherwise i'd be spending all my money on their IPAs  longer review - not much more to say, been here a few times, and every time i absolutely love each beer that i try, and all the food that i've ordered has been tasty as well (although my memory of some of the food is a little hazy!). i'd definitely recommend the roman candle IPA and the duck hearts. the atmosphere here is really cool too, good service, and the noise level isn't out of control - conversations are easy to have. as i mentioned before, the main problem with this place is the possible extreme wait times... i'd suggest showing up early, putting your name down, and heading to a nearby bar or restaurant to pass the time until your table opens up. also, if you aren't a beer fan you're kind of out of luck here. but maybe don't go to a brewery if you're not a beer fan?"}
{"text":"STOP EVERYTHING and go to Bellwoods right now for the Frambizzle! The fruitiest, most raspberry-filled and most delicious summer beer in the existence and history of all of mankind. That's right folks, the most scrumptious beer ever to be made can be found right here in our homeland on the lovely Ossington strip.  Bellwoods Brewery, it seems you are officially turning me into a beer girl.  The craft beers here are made in small batches and the menu is constantly changing and rotating, which means if you want the frambizzle you need to go now. I've had the most amazing fruity girly beers here, containing elements of peach, hibiscus, coconut and lime. But last night's brew was hands down my favourite.  Why 5 stars? Previously my relationship with BB existed on a patio basis, but last night as we waited in line a spot on the mezzanine became available. My beau and I took it, even though our hearts had been set on the patio, and I am so glad we did. From up there we could see the vats, the dining room, the patio, the bartenders as they poured pint after pint. I actually hadn't realized how much fits into this place before.  I've never even had the food here, side from some almonds drowning in honey and cayenne (YUM!), but there are a few menu items that look amazing. Perhaps I shouldn't go forward with the five, but I can't help it. I have such a nice time when I come here. This place just makes me really happy.   The other great thing about Bellwoods is you can buy their beer. Forgetting the name of my fave drink, I hurriedly rushed to the retail side to buy my new bevvy. \"Tell me you have the razzmatazz!?\" I said, frantically. \"I believe you mean the Frambizzle,\" he said. Indeed I did! But alas, that's a new beer and it's not being bottled until this weekend. As fate may have it, it seems I will be back at BB within the next couple of days."}
{"text":"I came here to meet friends on a crisp, fall evening. We sat in the patio. Once I used the washroom I realized there isn't much seating inside.   While the sausage was GREAT, the service was slow and morose. I think if you are not extroverted, don't work here! Go work at Harvey's where your moroseness can help buffer the boredom of the burger station as you add the condiments to each order.  All this to say, the service was lackluster and everyone experienced bad service. A drink order did not arrive until the bill was presented!  Don't come here expecting a full kitchen or a full menu selection. These are small dishes. I ordered the Smoked Bratwurst and it came served in between a slice of toast bread cut in half. A bit too quaint for me and that dainty touch is lost on me. There are pieces of potato crisps (sticks) mixed with the sauerkraut. It adds a nice texture and taste.   My friend ordered the meatballs and she said they were delicious,  My friend ordered Roman Candle and enjoyed it. I wish I could remember the bottled beer I ordered. It had the colouring of stout. But less heavy.  I don't think I will be returning here."}
{"text":"This place can be described in two words - Hipster Hype. We visited Bellwoods Brewery while touring local breweries on father's day, and it was by far the worst brewery in the opinion of three slightly drunk and one sober adults. The draft beers were airing on a bad side of the experimental beers, I've tried worse in Michigan but Bellwoods came pretty close. The food, including a freshly grilled hotdog was quite mediocre and nothing to make a return trip for. Price on the other hand was definitely more than the value received. Why is it so popular? The same reason frame-less glasses and short shorts are...trendiness, try explaining that to my stomach, it doesn't watch fashion channel."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to just kick back, relax and have great beer with you and your pals!   The decor is very simple and straight forward. Nothing whacky or too crazy. Wooden tables and everything. There's seating inside as well as a patio outside. Their menu is incredibly tiny and simple as well. First few pages were all of the different types of beer that you can order and the last two pages were for appetizers/small eats and entree plates.  A bunch of my friends and I decided to just hang out here, have a few drinks and just catch up on life. I've got to say that the beer at this place is insanely fresh tasting and delicious. You can really taste the clear and crisp feel from each gulp and it was just great. The service was also excellent and very attentive!  My friends ordered their fries but it wasn't anything special, it was just like any other fries.  Overall, this place is great for beer lovers of all sorts and I would definitely come back to try more from their selection of beers and their food."}
{"text":"Full disclosure - I'm not a beer fan. What I love about the beers here (my fave is Wizard Wolf), is that they have unique flavours and combinations.  Perhaps there's an element of novelty, but I do actually enjoy to try and discover beer tastes that I like.  Food is tasty, however keep in mind, it's mostly sharing plates - so if you're hungry, go elsewhere first.  Or be prepared to spend a bajillion dollars here, it's not cheap.  Most of all, I love the outdoor patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Trendy micro brew. Lightly lite with candles. Enjoy their brews on tap as well as their neighboring brews. They have a reserved section as well. They have a great variety of appetizers. So i tried  Beers:  Farmageddon batch 9 - light, sweet and aromatic.  Roman Candle - more to my tasting, hoppy but not a mighty.  Witch shark - this hit the spot for me :) II ipas are my fav. Stopped next door to the shop and picked up 4 to bring home.   Food: mussles were delicious, their fried chicken are deboned served with a side of yummy sauce and a side of seasoned fries complimented with a garlic mayo to dip."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery gets 5-stars! Definitely had a great time here with beers & platters etc. :) This place has a warm, hipster and artsy vibe to it - they have huge beer brewers which adds to its atmosphere. We had the Buffalo Chicken Sausage & the Meat Board - loved both of these but the Meat Board (salumis, terrines, crostini) in particular! The dip was so yummy, it paired very well with the bread.  The waiters were very knowledgeable with the beers they offered - he recommended a citrus-y, grapefruit tasting beer which was one of the best beer I've ever tried so far.. Wished I remembered the name!!"}
{"text":"Very busy, was the only place with a packed house on a Wednesday on the whole Ossington strip (which is a good thing!)  We were seated at a picnic table on the patio and had to share with another group, so it made for slightly awkward conversation, but there are plenty of solo tables available too.  Beer menu was small and kinda pricey (most $7.50 for 16oz). Didn't get to try the food.   Decent considering cool patio. Friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Love the vibes here, especially in the summer when you can sit out on the front patio with the little lights hanging down. It's a great place to come and just hang out for a few drinks. It's loud and always packed during the busy season, but it's worth the little wait if you have to. The food isn't great, so I'd just stick to the drinks unless you absolutely need some snacks to go with it."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery has an amazing patio, but that's not all that's amazing about it. Even if you can't sit outside, the inside of Bellwoods opens onto the patio on nice days so you still get fresh air. Prepare to possible wait in line depending on when you come -- it's worth it.   On offer are a decent selection of Bellwoods beers, as well as some more fancy bottles on the last page of the menu. If you like sour beers, the Jelly King is a must-try. I tried the Boysenberry Plum Jelly King (5.6%) - it was sour, hoppy, and a bit fruity. I also tried Ghost Orchid (an IPA, 6.3%). I'm not usually a huge IPA fan, but this one is only a little bitter. A beer will run ya about $8.  I've also recently tried the Paper Tiger (a pilsner, 5.3%) and while it wasn't my favourite beer there, I appreciate that Bellwoods has a larger selection of beers now compared with previous times I've gone.   They serve snacks during the day on weekdays and snacks/light lunches on weekend days, which is all that I've tried food-wise. The Daily Bread with butter (chili lime butter, $5) was super tasty. The fries came in a large portion with tons of mayo on the side ($8). Their Crispy Tofu Banh Mi ($10) was pretty good, although it left something to be desired compared to other Banh Mis I've tried. Their bar nuts ($5) are salty, sweet and delicious.  The vibe is trendy but friendly and I've always gotten attentive service here.  The decor is sleek. Gender neutral washrooms too!   Definitely stop by for a pint and a snack if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I dropped by because my friends all told me great things. \"Good beers and good vibes.\" What more do you need. The beer selection was great, and everyone was having a great time."}
{"text":"If I was able to stuff Bellwoods Brewery into my pocket and take them home I totally would. There are a few things to keep in mind in order to make your visit here the best possible: -There will be a wait and it's not open seating -All seating including upstairs, bar, and patio require your name to be put on the list -They specialize in Pale Ales and offer bites  BB was probably one of the more intimate breweries I've been to as it really does look like a great spot for a date night. Cozy and warm, and it's not the typical Brewery setting whatsoever. They take pride in their craft and I was totally floored by their beers. So much so I purchased a few to bring back with me.  Definitely a must do while visiting or living in Toronto!"}
{"text":"And the best microbrewery in Toronto goes to....Bellwoods Brewery!  So far, Bellwoods is the clear winner for best microbrewed beer in Toronto.  They have a great mix of styles, flavors, and traditional/experimental beers on tap.  I like that they do 4 oz tasters for $3 and full pours are in the $6.50-$8.50 range, which is reasonable for high-quality and often high-alcohol beers.    I'm a particular fan of Grandma's Boy, a Belgian trippel that's been barrel aged for 6 months.  Wow, outstanding citrus flavors combine with wild yeast complexities.  Their IPA's are almost close to my ideal, one step back from the California style of adding as many hops as they can possibly fit in the kettle.  One or two beers weren't totally my style, but were still good. Their saison was a very interesting beer, for example, but completely different from the style that I was expecting for a farmhouse saison, much drier and more vegetal.  The food offers a nice mix of meat and vegetarian options.  The housemade sausage was quite good.  I also love that they know what an heirloom vegetable is!  I could take no issue with their (pickled) vegetables and their lovely acorn squash with grits and celery root.  Prices are reasonable and the taste is good.  It's even more amazing when you walk by and see how tiny the kitchen is.  The servers are friendly and quite knowledgeable about their beer.  I mean they're on the hipster side, but what else do you expect from a trendy microbrewery on Ossington?  I found that the tall guy had better beer recommendations than the hipster waitress with the neck piercing (can I say ouch!).      The main problem: this is a small restaurant.  The outdoor patio is lovely and in the fall has nice heat lamps; however, come winter there's not a lot of seating.  It can be a real pain to get a seat, even when they're not busy.  So alas, I doubt I'll be here at too many peak times.  Looking forward to them expanding and maintaining their quality."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here but I didn't find anything much to be special. Beers were alright (may be I have to try other ones), food seems to be a bit overpriced but fries were loaded. Servers were friendly but it was quite busy so everything's gotta be done quick. I don't know why but I'm still down to return and try more beers to see what the hype is all about. The location is walking distance from the bellwoods bark and the streetcar also drops you near the brewery so it's pretty convenient."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery is a great place to come for beer..... If you can get in!!!  They have a separate area where you can purchase beer to go. Otherwise, call before showing up or you may be in for a long wait.  Service here is good. The hostess is nice and engaging. Once you are seated, things can slow down, but the staff do a good job of presenting the 10 or so beer choices.  The beer is the star of the show, and it is quite good. They have a couple that are award winners. On my last visit, I had a porter that was fantastic."}
{"text":"Basically: Bellwoods for people that drive.  It's in an industrial zone and I can't even imagine taking transit to get here.  I suppose the main point is for Bellwoods to expand their brewing capacity and it makes sense to do it away rent-heavy Ossington.  For customers, it's primarily a bottle/merch shop - and I'm happy as fuck that I don't have to venture to Ossington and deal with parking to pick up my bottles.  They do offer 12 oz pours and you can sample most of what they have in bottles before you buy.  There are some tables and limited snacks - but it's definitely not the same 'cool' vibe as the original location.  That said, you don't have to deal with the long-ass lineups on Ossington either - so, thumbs-up!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere on a Wednesday night...busy, busy busy! But the food and the beer is CRAP!  We overpaid for a meat platter --- $25 for some thinly sliced meats, 7 half pieces of bread, and a pate that got me SOOOOO SICK (we're talking major food poisoning!!!). The beers were MEH. There was a sour beer on the menu that was clearly an experiment gone wrong and sadly marketed as a craft beer! And the manager that night was a bit prickly and all about safety violations...he was all in a huff when we tried to move bar stools over at the bar so that our group could sit together.  All in all, go somewhere else for drinks or dinner. Sadly, a bad experience and we'd be surprised if this place lasts another year...."}
{"text":"Such a truly lovely patio, with easy-going friendly staff who are happy to bring you samples and chat about beer. I sat in the shade, made use of the free wifi, and tried small 3$ glasses of a couple different homebrews and guest taps. They are doing nice light beers with tons of flavour - I loved their farmhouse and their orange and flowery APA. There is a long and smart list of bottles on offer here too - including Evil Twin and Saison Dupont this week - and the food looked delicious but I'll have to come back for that... Can't wait!"}
{"text":"So pleased that a great craft brewery opened up in Toronto. I love checking out craft breweries in the USA & this reminded me of some of the better ones I've been to.  If you go at peek times, it's really difficult to get seating inside. The outside patio is VERY nicely heated though. You can wait out on the patio, and the hostess will put you on the list to sit indoors.   Been there twice. First time I was seated outside with a group of friends until they had a seat ready for us inside. It was March, and pretty chilly outside, but the space heaters worked so well that I took off my coat. Took about 30 min for the hostess to get back to us about seating indoors, but we decided not to take it. My friends didn't really like the small menu for dinner.  I made sure to come back with another friend so I could try the food. I had a strong desire to eat the duck hearts. First time I've ever eaten duck heart, and it was delicious. Good price too. I paired it with a glass of Farmageddon, a lovely brett saison.  For desert we shared the Pudding Chomeur & I paired it with I believe their Russian Imperial Stout \"Hellwoods\". They paired amazingly, and I nearly licked the plate.   So people of Toronto, GO HERE! Support your local microbreweries. They have an amazing list of beers, and a great chef behind their seasonal menu. Apparently they also have a deal during the \"Witching Hour\" (first two hours they're open). If you can make it there in time, it's a good deal. The prices aint high for the Toronto market."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Nice place but busy and small  (had to wait for a table each time). It looks like there will be a nice patio in the summer time in the front of the place. I don't drink beer, but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok, nothing spectacular. Food was good but very pricey for the small amount that you get. You will be hungry leaving there! Service wasn't that great. The waitress forgot our second drinks order and never came back for it. She seems to be avoiding us the whole time. We got fed up waiting for the drinks and just wanted to get the bill. Again waited forever to actually find someone to ask for the bill, and then waited again to get the bill. Don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Loved this place - really cool space in Ossington area that had both amazing food and drink   Tried the Ghost Orchid IPA as well as both Pale Ales - amazing ; my husband also the skeleton key variant with coconut which he professed was his favorite stout ever!  The food was out if this world - pierogis were delicious with a heat mushroom flavor , fried tofu with a spicy dipping sauce , tuna with white beans ( Mario Batali does a similar dish only this one is better ) ', a delicious cheese plate with local Canadian cheeses - it was all so good  The place was a charming space with vintage looking furniture and a cool vibe . Great service , amazing food and drinks - wish I could bring this place back home with me"}
{"text":"Server got into a fight with me and spilled a drink all over me because .... i wanted to take a bottle of cider outside. I thought breaking the law was my problem. Evidently servers double up as the custodians of morals. Noble pusuit indeed. I expected a different attitude from service and entertainment industry.   Menu is overpriced too.  If u want a lesson in following orders - come. Here."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this location & brewery and I must say overall I was happy with the ambiance and location as I sat outside with my friends on the patio. However, I have 2 pet peeves with this location, and I find both to be equally as important: 1) seat management, and 2) price.   In terms of 'seat management' the hostess who served us didn't seem to find the concept as important as other places do. For example, we lost out sitting on the outdoor patio TWICE as people inside decided to switch their seats up. That was a first for me... So patrons inside who decide they don't like where they're sitting can just change up as they please while there's a lineup outside of people waiting to get in? Make with that what you please.   The other kicker was 'price'. How are you charging me as a brewery $7 for a pint when your brewing the batch on site on location? If anything, shouldn't you be charging slightly cheaper prices as that's the price I would pay at another restaurant who serves your brew? Doesn't make sense to me, and good thing I have no immediate plans to ever return back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now so I decided I'd write a review.  Both my experiences there were pretty much the same so here are my thoughts...  The patio and vibe of this place are awesome! No better way to spend a summer night then hanging out having a pint on their patio. The tables are communal so if you don't have a group big enough to fill one, you will be mixed in with some strangers. The beers are delicious! I've yet to try one that I don't like here and the prices are pretty standard.  The biggest downside to this place is the service. Generally unpleasant staff and long waits are the only thing that make me think again about going back. If there beer was awful, I'd never return. Have had food orders that never made it to the table so we had to eat elsewhere and long waits between beers. Also, have seen guys from the kitchen take smoke breaks and return to the kitchen without washing their hands, but I guess that is why they aren't known for their food.  If you go here, just go in with patience and just for the beers and you should have a great time. I hope they start selling their beers in the LCBO soon though as I am a fan."}
{"text":"despite being tucked away in the most non-commuter-friendly industrial area, not all that close keele st. or lawrence ave. (the nearest major roads), i'm very glad that this second bellwoods location exists.  it's a massive warehouse-esque space that they use 1. to expand their brewing operations (kudos to them for being able to brew in their cramped ossington location), and 2. as a bottle shop.  however, they've carved out and decorated a really nice space in the front for customers to sample their frequently-rotating offerings via tap.  they also do $5 12oz pours and have some snacks, but my perception of this place as a customer is that it's primarily a bottle shop.  since this is a place you'd drive to, you wouldn't want to have more than one 12oz pour here.  the fun part about the current offerings here is that they're always experimenting with hoppy, sour, and belgian beers - certainly their forte - so there's always something new and exciting to try.  definitely give those a shot.  just don't come in here looking for a lager!  i've spoken to a number of staff here, and they're all friendly and enthusiastic to talk about their beer, or beer in general.  makes the short stay worthwhile"}
{"text":"Had smoked bratwurst, fries, and bread from blackbird bakery. Food was unexpectedly good.   Very crowded but didn't take long to get seated. Staff was very accommodating and patient when we added another person to our party and had to switch tables.   Lovely spot during good weather!"}
{"text":"Me and the boys headed over to the Bellwoods for a few pints and a bite the other night. The location and overall vibe was primo.  One of the beers was generally well accepted, a few others were gut wrenching ( and I am a huge fan of micro beers!) Too many strong, Belgian style beers. Why no Czech, German pilsners? Why no Lagers with lower alcohol? Having a couple of beers there is almost like quaffing back a pint or two of scotch!  The food was tasty, but way too expensive. The sausage meal was underwhelming in terms of quantity.   I may be back in a year or two, once my wallet and stomach recuperate!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! Ambiance is A+++. The fairy lights and the live wall make it super cozy, the patio is magical. That being said, it can be little cooler in the fall, and gets SUPER SUPER busy.   My friend and I came on a Tuesday and we managed to get one of the last seats on the patio at around 7pm. Service was good, and our servers were knowledgeable about the beers. All of their beers have a slight hop note to them which I am a big fan of. They also have an extensive list of other beers that you can pick from. Unfortunately, their veggie friendly offerings are not very extensive, so no food for us.  I will definitely be back for more beer and the ambiance!"}
{"text":"A must-see when in Toronto! My only regret was that we came here in the winter so their garage door was not open out to the patio.  It looks like a great little place to visit during warmer months.  The interior was so welcoming.  Wood everywhere.  It has a farm-feel which is carried further by the soft-spoken, sweet and helpful staff members.  I felt like I was drinking beer in someone's kitchen! Which, in this case, was an excellent thing.  The beer isn't cheap but if you come during their \"witching hour\" (first 2 hours that they're open) you get a couple dollars off each drink.  The beer is all delicious and unique.  It's unfortunate that they don't have flights, but with the top quality of this beer it's not all that surprising (they will let you have a sample before ordering if you prefer)."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the beer as I couldn't drink that night, but the food was unimpressive at best and left me very unsatisfied. The portions are small which perhaps turned out to be a good thing because the taste was so unappetizing. Go there for the beer and go somewhere else for the food. This was the worst food I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Great spot. Enjoyed both the  farmhouse / brett saison and the juice king(?) sour. Both are well made beers. Love the feel of the place. Good service. Nice Biergarten area. Will definitely be back. Look forward to trying the food next time."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the bumpin'est patios in the hood. Craft beers and meat/cheese boards... Can't go wrong! I love the picnic tables - they're comfier (apparently not a word?) than they look, and when this place gets busy, you get to sit beside some cool strangers! Just don't come here for a full meal, because you won't find it... Menu is snack bar-esque."}
{"text":"Bellwoods is a solid 4 for it's dope vibes, sick patio, and excellent craft beer menu - however food and service can be improved. Located right on Ossington, the restaurant has a large patio which is great for summer. I've been here a couple times now and always enjoy some wicked cool beers that are made brewed by the restaurant. In terms of food, they are passable but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Great location with a quaint atmosphere. Family style seating allows for short waits to get seated. The Blackberry Jelly King and the Roman Candle IPA were both excellent beers and accurately described on the menu. The Smoked Bratwurst and The Falafel Lettuce Wraps were both incredible."}
{"text":"I must've passed this place a million times and not noticed it. It probably used to be a auto repair place or something. Went in on a friday night, it was packed. Some friends had been the previous week and said it was good and cheap. Both ended up being true.  We had a bunch of each type. My faves were the saison and the blitzen (the latter being the best - it's the strongest one - i think i may be spelling it wrong). Anyway, the small glasses are like $2.67 or something. stupid cheap. The food is just OK. My friends played up the duck hearts but I found them way too salty. Maybe it was a bad night.  As a side note they had one of those cool-ass dyson heating thingy's at the entrance to keep the waiters (us) warm. It was a conversation piece.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place for bites and drinks, if you can get in! There's always a huge line up so come early. The craft beer on tap is always great and I love getting the new flavors frequently at the beer shop next door. The patio is very nice. Fried chicken is tasty. All in all a perfect place to hang out with friends any evening of the week!"}
{"text":"The beer is amazing. Brewed with craft and passion. I lived a block from Bellwoods when i visited Toronto. I tried every beer they had on offer and was never disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally got to go and visit!   I've been wanting to go to Bellwoods since a friend of mine gave me a 4-pack of beers as a reward for bringing their guitar amp to them. They make fantastic beers, creative and delicious. Not stuff you will regularly find in the LCBO -- you have to come here to get them.  Located in a super hipstery park of the Bellwoods, we set up a dinner with a friend, and got here about half an hour before they opened for a dinner.  This was a very sensible choice, as this place get a LINE. We lucked out and were first, I saw the queue behind us wandering off into the distance. We were a tiny bit worried they wouldn't seat us without our entire party there (our friend is chronically late) but once they opened, they were cool, they sat us at one of their larger communal tables.  We ordered a couple of beers and waited for our friend, who arrived shortly thereafter.  As I said, the beer is worthy of 5 stars. They do a lot of \"funky,\" small-batch type of stuff, a lot of unusual beer styles (although goses and sours aren't that weird anymore.)   The food is also excellent .... but the quantity is a little small. It's small plates style food, and we ordered the following for three people:  Bread with garlic scape butter Ryeberry Salad Olives Cheese Board Meatballs  All of it was delicious, but I think for us, we were fearing we were going to run up a prohibitively high bill at the rate we were going, us being a trio of hungry people. So we decided to stop while we were ahead. We had no problems with the service, the staff were really friendly and helpful with suggestions, bringing out tasters if we wanted them before trying a full draught of beer.  Don't get me wrong at all, this is a really great place. However, if you're looking for a substantial dinner, you might be disappointed. I'd definitely come here again for a beer and some nibbles, and of course to pick up more beer."}
{"text":"So, anyone looking at this venue. This is the brewery on Hafis Road, not the brewery and restaurant on Ossington!  This is a slightly more driver friendly location, and an experience I'm used to from plenty of small breweries in the US. It's located in an industrial neighborhood, tucked into a corner, sort of off the beaten path. When we were there, it was snowing a bit, which made it pretty quiet.  They have a wall of coolers with bottles of what's currently available, as well as a bar area with what's currently on tap. They have a nice, non-fancy setup of tables with the brewery operation in the background. the decor is mostly the art that's on the bottles, and you can also purchase bottle art prints.  It's a great atmosphere, much more chill than at Ossignton. There were people there to just have a couple of pints and to hang out (like us,) and people coming in and out to buy packs of bottles. We had a nice time enjoying their excellent beer, and chatting with one of the brewers, who was really friendly, and asked us for any recommendations for the next time he was down in Connecticut.  A+ location, and a must visit if you're a serious beer enthusiast."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at this small brewpub in Ossington. The beers were fantastic... I had the Cat Lady (nice hops) and the Motley Crüe (a sour lambic which was very good). Shared some fried chicken and duck meatballs and fries with a couple of buddies and the food was delicious! Definitely try to make your way to this great spot in an emerging neighbourhood in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Bellwoods is honestly one of my favourite things about Toronto. I was there again on Friday night and as usual very happy with the drinks, food, atmosphere, and service.   Being the Friday of the long weekend there was a line to get in but as usual moved quickly - in my experience the line always seems to move more quickly than you'd anticipate based on its length. We sat on the patio and tried the jelly king (sour beer), farmhouse saison, and pilsner, all great. (Jelly king is VERY sour but if you like sour beers you'll love this one. Saison had similar flavour profile but not as tangy.) For food, two of us shared the rye berry salad, the chicken pot pie, and the apple fritters. All were great and the fritters especially were unique - 5 small donuts in a tangy cream sauce, so good. Great service even though it was very busy. Definitely sets the bar high for breweries."}
{"text":"A friend and I were wandering looking for somewhere to grab a drink and snacks on a Saturday night, and she suggested we go here.  Since I'm always looking to expand my beer horizons and had read lots of great things about this place, I was very excited.  And it did not disappoint - I can't wait to go back and have been raving to friends about how they have to go.  Maybe it just totally hit the spot for what I was in the mood for, but I loved everything about my experience here.  First off, the patio is brilliant - it's big, has a mixture of community style picnic tables and cute, smaller tables and a great ambiance.  When the host sat us with three other people at one of the picnic tables I was not too impressed having never sat with strangers at a restaurant like this, but it was surprisingly comfortable.  Their conversation didn't get in the way of ours (and hopefully vice versa) and I didn't even really notice I was sitting next to anyone.  The different types of beer they offer are up on a chalkboard about the restaurant entrance but each table also had a mini clipboard with very detailed descriptions of what they are which I thought was fantastic.  I'm far from being a beer connoisseur, but am trying to learn more about different types of beer and things like this are definitely helpful!  I started with the Petal Pusher, a Belgian pale ale.  It was light and refreshing but had a slight bitterness, and was delish.  My friend had the Muggelweisse, which was a darker sour beer, and despite me thinking that \"sour beer\" sounded awful, I tried a sip and ended up ordering it as my second drink.  I'd never had a beer anything like it before, and it was absolutely phenomenal.  I wish I could provide a more beer-snobby fancy description, but it's simply amazing.  Her second drink was another sour beer but this one was smoked and I also loved that.  The sourness that hit your tongue when you first sipped it was tasty but then it had a smokey flavour come through after, too good.    I just noticed the time and realized I had to wrap this up, but we also had the cheese board that came with four types of unreal cheeses, the bread and vegetarian dip (it was an eggplant based dip that night, very hearty, earthy flavour to it, almost reminded me of a stew) and the peanuts - all of which were ah-mazing.  The peanuts were ridiculously good, if you like that kinda thing.  Great spices used, too good!  This place is a must-go!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer hall location, really solid beers. I enjoyed a late night but and brew on a pleasant evening at the bar. Great vibe"}
{"text":"Further research is required...  I've tried flights of ALL OF THE BEERS and found them to be some of the most interesting and unique in all of my travels.  Some are very unusual though and you might not like them... and I don't like them all either, but I like the wide variety.  As for the food, I've only tried a couple of the appys which include the chicken hearts and the chili peanuts.  Both are fantastic.  I'm always looking for excuses to go back."}
{"text":"Nice brewery with beers made in house.   I don't usually like beer but I enjoyed the coconut pineapple beer.   They also have good finger food snacks.  Staff was ok."}
{"text":"Cool hip place with a large bottle selection. Staff is knowledgeable and eager to help with selections.   Be advised if you come by and you're loud or you don't fit in with the crowd, you may be asked to quiet down."}
{"text":"Awesome beer and food changes all the time, but very upscale and great food. They used to have a beer that tasted like wine!!! But too bad they keep changing their brews."}
{"text":"Love the bottle shop service here!  I was on my way to the LCBO at Ossington and Dundas last night when I walked past this place (and subsequently walked backwards with my neck craned like a character in a b-list comedy).  So glad I stopped into Bellwoods Brewery instead.  Friday just so happens to be the day to carry out bottles; they had seven available, ranging from $5 for 500 ml of the basic house ale to $17 for a seasonal imperial stout.  I chatted with the retail guys for a few minutes, and found them to be well informed about each product.  I walked out with two sour beers and a pale ale for $19.  If you like sours, get in here before they run out of the blood orange Jelly King.  Mmmmm."}
{"text":"I was warned, get there early or stand in line.  I got there early...enjoyed my beer and watched all those poor people waiting in a loooooong line.  Is it worth it?  YES!  Beer 5/5 - if you like craft beer you need to try theirs. Loved the Roman Candle and Wolfy.  Will be back to try others before the summer is out. They are also located next to their brewery so grab some take out for home consumption!  Food 4/5 - Interesting \"bread and ...\" trays. I had bread and cheese (Ontario made). Friends had bread and meat (pate - home made).  Pretty good but not super filling (especially when consuming copious amounts of beer).  Based on other reviewers I tried the duck hearts. Super spicy (for me) and nothing to write home about. Skip those and go for the platters or the fried chicken!  even their fries were great (sprinkled with some spices and cheese) Yum!  Ambiance/Seating 4/5 - We got a coveted seat outside!  Patio tables so dont wear a skirt! If your entire party doesnt arrive together - good luck.   People sit anywhere they can and you CANNOT hold seats for folks. That is the only reason I gave them a 4/5.  Otherwise its a great neighborhood beer joint - and worth the trek even if you dont live in the hood.  Remember to get there early though...."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the place has a great vibe. I've tried most of the beers and there isn't a bad one in the bunch. The food is ok and a bit light for the cost. In a previous visit there was a BBQ on the patio, but during the winter the menu is pretty light. The atmosphere and beer alone justifies 4 stars."}
{"text":"I think Bellwoods is a great place to go for beer. There is a good selection of ambitious, traditional, and unusual styles of beer made on-site that are well-executed and a moderate selection of guest taps as well.  Although their nuts are always a delicious option for a snack I don't think food is really their strength or focus.  Biggest complaint is that it's so popular that it's hard to get a seat! Even midday! Never come with a large group."}
{"text":"My initial impression of this place is that it has a good vibe, and I love the open patio in the front. The beers here are interesting, but I didn't taste one that I was absolutely fond of. I'd probably stick with the Grizzly Beer because its cheaper.  The food is more tapas than a sit down meal for the most part. We nibbled on some duck hearts. They didn't taste so bad, but they definitely looked like little terds on the plate. And the texture was kind of rubbery like how you would expect an organ to be. It was at least different for sure! We also nibbled on some of the cayenne honey almonds, which is probably your safest bet on the menu. Though I found the honey made them a little soggy and I might have preferred plain salty or smokey almonds myself. If I went back, I would be tempted to try the fried chicken, but I had already ate.  The staff there was super friendly and the vibe was great. Good atmosphere, but nothing tantalized my taste buds. Definitely willing to go back, just don't know when that'll be."}
{"text":"Such a great find. We were stranded in Toronto due to cancelled flight home to philly and were on the hunt for a good craft brewery to drown our sorrows. We could not be happier we landed here. Our visit started with a nice guy at the bar next to us offering some of his beer singing his praises. It was the grandmas boy and it was delicious! He also suggested the 2017 motley cru which we then purchased and loved!!! We had two awesome bartenders, one of which asked about one of our favorite breweries in philly and we were blown away. She suggested the white picket fence (another winner). I am a huge IPA fan and the goblins sauce was delicious.  Food wise, there is so much to choose from. The meatballs were our favorite but the pickles and ferments and the squid were also on point.  Not sure if we'll ever be back to Toronto but if we are we will certainly head here again. And we cannot wait for distro to the states!"}
{"text":"Cute, very hipster brewery in an artsy neighborhood. Came here for a drink before dinner on our last day in Toronto after reading the fantastic reviews on yelp. The decor is eclectic, modern, and hip, and the building appears to be an old garage. We were not able to get a table on the patio, but we sat at a table in front of the bar, and it was very pleasant.  We thought about eating here, but the food is a bit on the fussy side for our taste- think terrines, pate, and bone marrow. We got the french fries to share and had a round of beers. The fiance and I both had an IPA that was refreshing and enjoyable, and his cousin had a pilsner. His girlfriend had a \"Berliner Weisse\", which was not a true Berliner Weisse but actually a sour beer. I've lived in Germany for years and visited Berlin many times, and Berliner Weisse is always served with either raspberry or woodruff syrup. I don't doubt that the base could be the same, but I would have been very displeased if I ordered this, expecting a sweet, refreshing Berliner Weisse.  The fries were ordered were fantastic! The toscano cheese was a very nice touch, and we would have ordered more if we stayed longer.  Also, free wifi is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Ive been to Bellwoods a few times and have sat on the main and upper level. Beers are fantastic and is great for anyone looking to try something new. Two thumbs up for the variety.  The atmosphere is very welcoming (especially the summer patio when warm). However, when busy, the place can be quite loud making it quite hard to hear the person across from you (especially on the upper level)."}
{"text":"It was an okay experience. Had to wait a while for a table, got seated at the bar for about 45 minutes and then finally moved to the patio. The fries I ordered were insanely salty and made me feel sick because they were so salty. My friend enjoyed her cheese board though. It was not worth the wait I don't think I'll ever wait to go there again."}
{"text":"Every day they've got about half a dozen craft brews. Their beers are usually varied in qualities, but their IPAs are consistently very hoppy, the sours are tart and flavorful and the stouts are rich and chocolatey. If you like beer, this place is definitely worth visiting. The menu is a little quirky and the patio is glorious. The staff are prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"At first we weren't impressed due to wait time and four doubles getting seated before us due to the fact we needed a 4 top, however it was worth the wait in the end....Since we waited outside on a cold night they turned on the heat lamps and brought us beer while we waited. Our waitress was amazing, very upbeat, friendly with a great   knowledge of the beer menu. We started with the bounty hunter (dark and smooth) and the dark sour on cherries (great sour beer with a wonderful hint of coffee). Next we ordered the reserve Skelton Key which was spicy and delicious. Our friends tried a variety of IPA's and loved them all. For appetizers we shared the picked veggies, (the lotus flower root was amazing) and the french fries with galic mayo . For dinner we had the meatballs, pot pie, spaghetti squash and the falafel.  Everything was above our expectations. The duck meat balls are the best meatball I've ever had, the squash was sweet with great texture and the mushrooms in the pot pie added a great hearty flavor. We will definitely be back! Great food, drinks and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Gord and I went to a tasters event on Sunday at Bellwoods Brewery.  Since then, they have had a \"soft\" opening.  We stopped in last night to check it out.  I liked the ambiance.  The lights were low and there were candles and flowers on the tables. We had a table by the sliding door in front.  Hungry?  They serve an interesting array of food.  You can order a glass of wine if you don't feel like beer.   had my favourite, the Bellwoods Common.  Brewers Luke and Mike were there tonight and stopped by to say hello and chat.  Patrick took good care of us!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"what's not to love here? ok, sure, crowded weekends but aren't all good spots?  we tasted 4 beers creamy, cherry, robust, full bedamned, tolerance!  oh, and by the way: buffalo chicken sausage? don't leave without one."}
{"text":"Bellswoods Brewery is tucked into Ossington Avenue with its patio of picnic tables facing the street and appropriately sized seating upwards of 30-40.  Their patio is cute and appropriate for a casual night or date night; you can wear slacks and a fancy sundress or just shorts and tennis shoes.   In addition to their 5-8 of their beers on tap; there's 5-10 of their limited release bottled brews and 20-30 speciality beers from Canada and Belgium ranging up to $40 CND each. Our bartender was quite knowledgeable about it.   Their menu is limited; mostly fries, cheese and meat boards.   We arrived on a weekday at 8:00 PM and had no wait to sit at the bar on backless wooden stools.   . Very dim candles and soft blues music in the background.   They do not offer growler fills but you're able to purchase ~20oz bottles in an adjacent space although selection was limited to 2 of their brews.   A very high three stars."}
{"text":"The beer scene is tough in Toronto and Bellwoods is probably your best bet finding some decent IPA's anywhere in town. We came in pretty late and just made it to the brewery. The beers were decent (we had the Witch Shark and the Double Jitsu, both were pretty good ). They also have a small retail area you can buy bottles, t shirts and posters."}
{"text":"I've never been treated so poorly at a place in my life. I came from Philadelphia to visit my family and we were hoping to have a great night. The greeter at the door rudely asked my sister if she was ok because she \"looked tipsy\". We hadn't had a drink all day. We were visibly frustrated, but decided to ignore the incident. We were seated and told to wait for our server. We waited over 10 minutes and the servers were just standing around the cash register chatting it up. We ended up leaving with nothing. It's really sad because this looked like a nice place and I love to try different breweries."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try this spot for beer for sometime. The fact that they offered food was a bonus.  We needed some dinner after watching some auto racing and walking a bit of the city.   Let me say the beer is great. We're taking some home.   The food: fabulous! Everything we ordered was super fresh and well prepared. The tuna ceviche, perfect. The meatballs, flavorful and that sauce! The pappardelle, beautifully al dente and the veggies still crisp, not mushy.   And for the space, cozy, inviting complemented nicely by good, friendly but not over the top service.   If you enjoy well crafted craft beer and fresh ingredients, come here!"}
{"text":"Review based on coming here around 12:45am. No food menu at the time so we each got a beer but nothing special. Small place and unless the weather is nice for the seating outside, hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"This place is doing acrobats with my taste buds. What a special special place."}
{"text":"This place is quite good. My comments are for their food but if you love Beer this is also a place to go because they have many very unique flavours. There is always a line up outside so be prepared to wait for a table. Their food menu is very unique and delicious. All plates are sharable and pretty affordable for tapas. We ordered the fried tofu, the meatballs and chicken sausage. The chicken sausage was very tasty and my favorite out of all the 3 dishes I ordered. I definitely would come back."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars   VIBE  This local brewery has a KICKING patio! It's also a different place to have a date. And if your date loves beer, it's a great way (for him) to have a conversation and teach you about the brewing process (especially if the date goes bad it's a default topic).  The downstairs area is really nice too with communal tables. Upstairs, there is a row of stools that overlook downstairs and the brewery in the back. It's dimlit and the perfect spot for the date.   But one thing: the bathroom. We were wondering why our hostess was hesitant to send us upstairs and now we know why! There is only one bathroom and it's right near a few of the seats upstairs. Unbeknownst to me, I decided to sit right near by and unfortunately, it STANK. So needless to say, we didn't eat.   But the Brewery is new and these are growing pains. I'm not sure where else they can put the bathroom but it did detract from the ambiance.   WE DRANK  Berliner Weisse (3.2% ABV) A light, refreshing, deliberately soured German wheat beer. A classic but odd beer, characterized by its lemony, sourdough flavours and tart nose. Available with a seasonal fruit syrup, as per tradition.  It was very, very lemony. Light and refreshing.   Dining Companion had:  Lost River IPA (7.3% ABV) An American IPA with aromas of fresh fruit and pine. Malt and bitterness balance to create a very refreshing IPA with good mouth feel.  He liked it!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Minus the bathroom incident, this is a nice place to go and is a great first date place. I'll be back and trying the food but downstairs! Do expect to wait. Patio gets packed fast and you will be shoulder to shoulder with your neighbours if you're required to share a bench.  I think the guys put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into this but they just need to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I was visiting in town from Seattle for a  weekend trip after traveling for work and kept hearing that Bellwoods was the brewery to visit.   The beers were excellent (favorites being the Jelly King sour and Witchshark DIPA) and the bartender was very friendly (as is everyone in Toronto) which I appreciated after traveling alone for the past week.   Nothing new that hasn't been said on prior reviews but gotta give credit where it's due. Thiis place was the anchor for my Toronto trip and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Maybe Bellwoods Brewery(BB) will be my spot for Summer'12.  Another sign of the  of the changing times on the Ossington Strip, BB (in a former garage nonetheless) is a great new addition.  I've been wanting to go there for a while, a while being the month that it's been open! I was curious about the buzz that it's generated in such a short while and also curious to see what the proprietors had done with the place that had been in their possession for a bit and counting.   My curiosity was amply rewarded. Goes to prove an old adage wrong.   We had to wait approximately 15-25 mins at 9 pm on a Friday evening  but noticed that the lineup got longer as the evening progressed.  Very minimalistic decor, cavernous tanks, high ceilings give the renovated garage a feeling of ample leg space even though it's admittedly not very large.   I was glad that it's not a very large space inside because that meant we got to experience the patio! Sitting on picnic tables made from freshly cut pine under clear skys, sipping delicious beer, laughing with old friends and making new friends: definitely a great summer evening!   I started with the Farmhouse Saison which was very light, smooth, fruity and summery. Moved on to the double IPA which packed a stronger punch and was very citrusy. Lastly, had what I call the 'coffee brew': smelled deliciously like caffeine, tasted smooth with a shot of espresso in it, and packed the strongest punch at 9.5%. I enjoyed the gradual progression of beers and appreciated the input of the servers!  The bar snacks on the other hand were disappointing. As much as i like trying out new things the pairings were off: boiled potato pieces on a stick with anchovie mayo and lamb tongue just didn't seem to gel with the beer. One needs something heartier with beer like duck fat fries or proper skewers or mini sausages or something!  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at BB and will most definitely head back a few times more before the sun sets on Summer'12."}
{"text":"The space is stunning - especially at night... and they have a great big patio open now :)  The lineup to get in was frustrating - they wouldn't take a reservation nor would they allow us to go up the block for a drink while we waited 1 hr for a table... nor did they provide a waiting area so we stood awkwardly in a group of people waiting for tables at the door, sort of in everybody's way and killing the vibe of the tables nearby (note* avoid the door table if you can!)  Beer/wine/snackies were great.  We did order a 'main'... which was *really* expensive and rocked that 90's barely-anything-on-the-plate / hit-mcdonalds-later portion.  At the end of the night it was a great vibe, great service, and tasty treats.  Staff were excellent with food allergies."}
{"text":"Wow Bellwoods certainly have upped their game with their beers recently and I am quite impressed! Love the new Witchshark and Goblin Juice double IPAs. And prices are quite reasonable considering it hasn't changed much relative to other places.  A great place to hang out at their awesome patio in the hip Ossington area. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Being a cocktail girl, i didn't really expect to fall in love with Bellwoods as hard and fast as i did.  If you are there in the summertime, i strongly recommend sitting on their patio.  I challenge anyone to find me a local that rivals this one for people watching. The menu offering at Bellwoods isn't huge but there are so many solid picks, you cant go wrong.  We wanted to keep it light so we just ordered two salads.   You must order a side of bread because it comes from Toronto's own Woodlot.  The salads that we ordered were so well conceptualized, everything worked.  The first had a smoked duck egg, greens and strawberries.  I am continuously looking for new and innovative dishes, this was one.  The smoke on the egg wasn't overpowering and went so well with the sweetness provided by the strawberries.  As if the next salad could top the first, it did.  It was just greens with crispy pig ears.  The variety of greens provided many different notes, and the crispy ears gave so much texture and saltiness.    Overall, a fabulous place to spend your afternoon or late evening with friends and a bevvy in hand."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special. My experience may be negatively skewed because I don't really like beer. Food is average. Great patio though."}
{"text":"I've been to Bellwoods twice on back-to-back trips to Toronto. When visiting other cities, I typically don't go back to the same place twice (there's just too much to see!) unless it's really great. Bellwoods is really great.  They have a terrific array of beer brewed in-house. The beer is definitely the best part of this place. They've got impressive sours, porters, pale ales, etc. Not only does the beer taste interesting and good, but they also put effort into the naming and art- branding, for lack of a better term- behind their brews. In fact, we plan to have two framed Bellwoods posters, based on actual beers labels, hanging in our newly renovated kitchen. They operate a cool store right next to the brewpub where one can purchase merchandise like posters, t shirts, and, of course, beer.  After the great beer and \"branding,\" the next best thing about Bellwoods is the ambiance. The first time I visited, we sat right at the bar. It was great seeing the bartenders pour various beers and chat with them. On the next visit, we couldn't get seats at the bar or anywhere downstairs (a point I'll address later) but were seated on stools at a counter upstairs overlooking the entire operation. The music; the view; the service; everything was just perfect.   You're missing out if you don't pay a visit here."}
{"text":"Super impressed by this independent craft beer brewery in Toronto! These types of places seem to be new to Toronto.   Actually, depending on which beer you order, it's possibly hit or miss. We had a party of three, and 2 of our beers, both IPA's were hit (we all agreed Roman Candle IPA was excellent!)  One other one was a miss.   The Witchshark IPA  -9% alcohol!- was too strong for me but my friend loved it, while the 3rd beer, which was recommended by the waitress  (can't remember the name, but it was unfortunate) we all agreed was just bad. Guess to each his own! Hopefully they were just trying to get rid of the batch and wasn't ACTUALLY recommended!    It seems if you appreciate good craft beer, however, it  IS possible to find it here! FINALLY.   Atmosphere was really nice, casual, right in the brewery with good heat-lamps for the mostly outdoor space.   One of the waitresses was kinda rude when my boyfriend accidentally bumped into her in the tight space, yelling, \"WHATEVER!\" at me when I politely tried to apologize for him.   Other than that flaw in the service (please be a bit more professional!), this place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Beer isn't my poison of choice and when I do opt for it I'm very picky. There beer here is delicious, which says a lot since I normally don't like beer! They make it on-site and you can see all the big tanks. The atmosphere is very cool, with lots of wood and metal accents.   There were about 7 or 8 options for draft plus some bottles. I told the server the type of beer I normally like (white ones like Hoegaarden) and she recommended the Belgian-style Farmhouse Ale. She was bang on; this beer has now been added to my top 3 favorites! I remember visiting the Biermarkt and saying the same and being served a giant serving of beer that I didn't like, so it was refreshing (literally) to meet such a knowledgeable beer server and being happy with what I ordered.   One of the things I LOVE about this place is that they offer a taster size which is maybe 4 oz. if I recall correctly. That's right up my alley because I'm not the type to consume a pint at a time; I much prefer a flavourful sipping drink... Quality over quantity, perhaps?  The Farmhouse Ale had some complex floral notes which reminded me of when I fell in love with Sauvignon Blanc in New Zealand, and all the goodness I like in Hoegaarden, which I can't really explain because I don't know much about beer. All I know is it was delicious and could quite possibly be my new favourite beer.   The beer really does deserve 4 paragraphs of praise. The service also should be praised. I could barely explain what I like in a beer and she was bang on with the recommendation. She also had lots to say about each beer and I feel like I learned some things about it, though as soon as I started consuming it I forgot everything I learned.   The food is decent. Everything is local (I think) and seasonal, like wild leeks, which are called ramps in some places, including here. Small portions for the price so not the best value, and the flavours are pretty simplistic. Not bad but it's obvious that the shining stars are the brews.   I'll definitely be back for some beer!"}
{"text":"Walked by and I had to try it. I haven't really liked any of the Canadian beer I've tried so far but I know there must be good craft beer. Well, there is and it's here. I hade the Jutsu (American Pale ale) and wizard wolf (pale ale) and I really loved them both. The Jutsu just a little more. I ordered the grilled squid, it comes with pesto and charred chili romesco. It looked and tasted amazing, the portion was a little too tiny tho. Overall very satisfied, I might have to snack some extra protein later on"}
{"text":"This spot reminded me of Germantown in Philly. Those great local businesses in this very residential area.  As a Montrealer who's a proper beer lover, I got some mileage to get me some beers. Yes, my trip to Toronto had 2 primarys destination and getting some beers from Bellwood Brewery was one of them. My biggest regret was lack of time and money, otherwise I would have had a review to tell you the food was great :)  However this is just for the Brewery store portion. Little thing we need to tell: Bellwood, in my opinion, if the best Ontario Brewery. Period. It's solid. I drank their DIPA - WitchShark, the Wolf Wizard and the Farmhouse ale. The farmhouse even though was a very legit Farmhouse ale, is not a style I particularly like. The Wolf Wizard a Pale Ale,had some strong hoppy feeling to it with some Wheat tasting final that I found was quite pleasing. Finally the WitchShark was a Hoppy flavoured with some Mango and Grapefruit touch I really enjoyed.   Great news is the brewery is getting a new location to hopefully bring their position high enough to make more than 4-6 beers at the time and of course maintain a proper offering to the demand which is pretty mad!!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome vibe! As soon as I saw the patio out front I was immediately drawn in.   My friend and I only had to wait a few minutes to be seated, granted we weren't at the patio, but the inside is still nice and airy and has a great ambience.   I ordered a West Avenue cider, their corn on the cob and my friend and I split their fries with garlic mayo. Their corn and the cob was definitely the highlight for me! So flavourful with just the right amount of kick from the chipotle sauce and BBQed to perfection.   The service was wonderful; our server was very efficient and made sure we were enjoying our food.   This is a great spot to go for casual drinks and a couple of delicious share plates with friends or on a date."}
{"text":"Bellwoods brews really good beers and they are serious about it. Always expect a queue its usually packed. The beers are priced from 7$ and they are worth every penny.   I had duck meatballs, nuts and vegetarian dip with flatbread, they were all really good. The service is above average, they are slow due to crowd and huge circulation. Definitely recommended though."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery is definitely my favourite and go to place for the summer. If you are not a fan of the hipster vibe or beer (especially hoppy ones) then this is definitely not the place for you. The line ups can be long during the summer (around a min 30 min wait) and the hostess can be very particular with seating but trust me, its worth it.   The brewery is a great place to sit back, relax and drink with your friends. They recently renovated the patio which means that you're sheltered during the rain and warm with their heaters.   In terms of their beer, they love keeping you on your toes with the ever changing availability of beer. Personally, I'm a huge fan of their sour beer..maybe because it taste like bread but if you're an IPA fan, they always have at least 3 beers in their menu that is hoppy (Roman Candle, Wizard Wolf). Long story short, their beer is amazing..which is why you should check them out this summer whereas for their food, head over to the Golden Turtle esp during breezy summer nights."}
{"text":"Excellent.  The beer menu is fantastic! I quite enjoyed the chickpea salad and meat board.  There could be a wait even on a weekday.  Also be prepared to share your table with strangers."}
{"text":"Saturday night, most of the bars were pretty packed and we wanted to grab drinks. A friend suggested this place and it was alright. I like the setting of the place and it was very popular and was busy. We got a table after 10 minutes and we got one of their recommendations for beer and it was delicious.   Our server was good, she kept checking up on us.   They have many different beers to choose from, it was nice to go with whatever she recommended. She suggested two beers to us, both of my friends got the first choice and I wanted to try the second one - which tasted horrible. It was alright because my friend switched with me.   Not much to say about the food because I didn't get the chance to try it. We were just barhopping around town."}
{"text":"Upgrading Bellwoods to a full fledge 4 after my dinner here.  I'm going to be honest, the food is solid and reasonably priced but it's not the reason why I like it here.  The beer, atmosphere, and service is the reason why you should try it out.  Before I forget, the wait can be bad.  The first warm day of the year and at 4 pm, there was a 30 minute wait.  I cannot imagine how it would be when it's actually hot and in the summer.  No reservations here.  So craft beer is trendy ... Toronto is loving it.  So imagine a micro brewery with a hipster cool and inviting atmosphere that is reasonably priced, serves solid dishes PLUS a patio.  You have Bellwoods Brewery.  Bellwoods sits on Ossington.  You can throw a rock and find 4 other amazing spots to eat.  Bellwoods has it's niche cause I dont know of another spot that has great beers at such a reasonable price.    Overall, the space has a lot of rustic woods and yet a lot of industrial fixtures to make it feel like a modern loft.  The bar and dining space also happen to share the same space as the kettles.  Above the main dining area, there's a loft like space.  It's intimate and cozy.  The main area isnt too big but you get to interact with the bar staff.  They're fun to watch... Looking from above, I see them constantly talking with customers and making people laugh.  The beer menu is impressive.  Not only do they have Bellwoods on tap, in bottles... they also have ciders and beers from other breweries nearby.  I would strongly recommend to talk to the staff on whats limited edition and try one of those.  Jelly King is one of our favourites with it's citrus profile and light sourness.  They had a special seasonal version with peach and raspberry.    Service here is prompt, thoughtful, and fun.  It's pretty low key in the sense that they actually enjoy serving you and being friendly.  It feels like you're visiting someone's house and they're telling you to come into the kitchen and grab a beer with some food.  They pay attention to the empty plates and always check in to make sure everything is good.  Pickle Plate - It was one of the better ones we've had in Toronto. With 4 different pickles on offer, this was a sizeable shared starter that gave you mushrooms (the best... nice sourness tempered with a bit of sweetness), cauliflower (there was a nice spice to this one), rutabaga (I think... its ok), and cabbage (its cabbage.  what else can i say).  I really liked the cauliflower and mushrooms the best.  3.5/5  Fries - This was a monster sized mountain of fries that came in.  HUGE even.  Cut to be thin shoe strings, these were served hot with a garlic mayo.  Some of the fries were good... crunchy and nicely salted.  Other ones on top were just warm and soft.  So I dont think these were all cooked at the same time or put into the oil at the same time.  I wish it was a bit more consistent.  3.5/5  Grilled broccoli salad - If you look at the picture, you'll laugh.  It is a giant pile of cheese.  All you see is white and you wonder where are the broccoli.  Well they're hiding under that insane pile.  The cheese is tender and very mild.  The broccoli was quite chilled... and it didnt have a lot of flavour.  Interesting take on a salad though.  3.5/5  Pork and Duck meatballs - These were delicious.  Really.  3 fairly large meatballs that were so tender and juicy.  The sauce had a nice spice kick to it and was the perfect dipping sauce for the fries.  I never used the garlic mayo once with this nice red sauce beside me. 4/5  Pierogies - So these are deceivingly small looking.  It's a RICH dish.  If you order this, don't expect to eat a lot more afterwards.  With a huge dollop of sour cream, celeriac puree, and porchini mushroom broth, the pierogies had a lot of flavour and creaminess in each bite.  The pierogies themselves were stuffed with cheese and mushrooms.  4/5  I'm not a devoted beer drinker but from what I've sipped, Jelly King and Farmageddon Cherry ale are 5 stars.  They're incredibly easy to drink, smooth, no funk, and nice fruit with citrus notes that are not too overwhelming.  Jutsu, Cat Lady, and Roman Candle are also good beers... but just not our favourite.     Great local spot and I love how you can support a great Toronto microbrewery directly.  Fun atmosphere and I see why there's a huge wait all the time.  I get the love and they give it back as well!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try Bellwoods Brewery as it has an amazing atmosphere and patio. I'm a growing fan of Toronto craft beers and wanted to try their selection. I like darker beers so I tried the Motley Cru and Donkey Venom. Both definitely had interesting taste profiles, but were more akin to sipping beers than recreational drinking beers. They had very distinct and interesting aftertastes, but I don't think I would order them again.  They have a beautiful patio and you can probably get a seat for a small group of 2. It'll be hard to get seating for a large group unless you go early. Last time I went in a large group (5-6), the waitress continuously seated groups of twos before us, filling out all the new openings in the patio, and had no intention of saving a large table for us (we only found this out after asking her...20 patient minutes later...we would've waited forever. Maybe she was new.) Other times were more effortless. Great intimate setting for dates and beer lovers."}
{"text":"I've been back twice since with my girlfriends and the service has improved. The dinner mains have always been fantastic and worth it. The lunch is good it's a bit too pricey for what is offered. Their beers are great and I'm really glad I got to try them at the brewery itself."}
{"text":"Very chill place with fantastic choice of beers. Perfect outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"came here tonight for my friends birthday party of six. Food was great. Service was terrible our server Meg clearly shouldn't work in hospitality she was absolutely unfriendly . I asked her if there was a similar beer to shocktop and she responded with an attitude saying she wasn't familiar with the beer and wasn't helpful . Secondly at the end we were paying separate cheques we told her we would like to combine two of the bills together. I've been working in the hospitality industry for the past 8 years and I know from experience this isn't a difficult task. She responded \"well I just started the transactions so this is sweet\" ( we told her before she started the payment) totally unwelcoming demeanour and ruined the entire experience for us. Won't go back ."}
{"text":"Too cool for school staff. Food is good though. Grilled cheese and pork sammy definitely good for a beer place."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! The atmosphere and decor is perfect for their vibe, not to mention how fantastic their beer is. Food was also very good. Definitely will be visiting again"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Vancouver BC, and this brewery reminded me a lot of the west coast.  Their beers are delicious, I give their pate two thumbs up, and their service was really chill (their staffs approach you as if you're long time besties)."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breweries. They have some very unique beers, and there's a great rotation so you get variety each time you go. Their food is simple but yummy - the highlight is the beer. Their patio is also adorable in the summer"}
{"text":"Bellwoods makes some pretty tasty beers.  The food is a bit overpriced but is quite good.  Staff was friendly and always there to see if we needed anything.  Bellwoods has one of the best patios on Ossington."}
{"text":"You can get a flight at Bellwood's for (I think) $9. I suggest Hellwood's (like beer made from espresso!) combined with one of the lighter beers (fortune cookie, so fresh) and a sour beer (I like the mash pipe but it is a serious not-normal strange thing) for the neapolitan ice cream of alcoholism.  And not like Chapman's or PC. Like a mother who carefully blended her breast milk with a prized cow's and churned it in the root cellar under Green Gables.  I've never had problems with waiting but I tend to go on weeknights, when I've found the servers to be smart and sweet."}
{"text":"Great place! Was not blown away by the beer but everything was solid which is hard to find. Every beer they had on draft was quite good and the food was even better. Who though Duck Meatballs could taste so good and the Halloumi appetizer was excellent. Had to finish off dinner with the carrot cake served in a mason jar, paired with a one year old barrel-aged Brett Porter.  Arrived 1 hour after they opened on a Thursday and there was literally one seat left at the bar. There was always a line to the street of people waiting for a table so plan ahead. Bar staff never stopped moving nor smiling; some of the best service I've ever had when that busy.  Definitely put them on your short list for craft beer destinations in Toronto."}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery is a great place to head to if you like craft beers and a great patio to drink them on!  On my last visit we tried about 6 different beers and all were great - some not necessarily my preference, but none that were off-putting. Price is reasonable, service is great (servers are super friendly and quick!), and the food is pretty good (you will see everyone snacking on fries & garlic mayo and you will cave in and get a plate of your own after smelling them pass by you again and again).   Only downfall is the place isn't too big so there is often a line-up with slow turnover, so you could be waiting a rather long time to score a table.  Bonus - the retail shop is located right next door so you can grab a couple of your favourite bottles to go on your way out!  Would I return? - Absolutely Parking? - Street parking on Ossington Value for $? - Good Space? - Small place/area in entrance-way to line up in while waiting Ventilation? - Good Service? - Great"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Yay for the beers, but Nay for the food. If you're hungry, just order another pint. ;)  I like the Bellwoods Brewery and I love the garage-cum-brewpub venue - it's super rad with a huge patio. While it's not uncommon to see their beers offered on taps at various establishments in town, their brewpub (obviously) has the largest on-site selection, many which are brewed there.   From your IPAs, to saisons, to trappists  and to ciders, you're guaranteed to find something you like. They also frequently rotate new kinds of beers in, and one of my recent favourites is the BELLWOODS HELLWOODS - a creamy smooth Russian imperial stout that clocks in at 10% ABV!   My only issue here is that, while the idea of having your food freshly grilled is great, their actual food is really quite subpar in taste, portion size and price. I've tried a bunch of items but the most striking case is their HOUSE MADE SAUSAGE, which is, quite possibly, the blandest sausage ever. I'm not even sure how you manage to mess this up and REMOVE flavour from fat and pork and more fat! My advice, stick to the liquid diet and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"Checked out Bellwoods Brewery while visiting Toronto during the film festival and loved the vibe. It was summer and the place was heaving but the server was lovely and did his best to get my friend and I a good spot out on the patio.   We ordered a beer flight and some fries as a light snack- they were incredible! Best fries I've ever eaten with toscano cheese, fine herbs and garlic mayo. The staff are great and know all about the beers, plus it's a great spot for people watching in this very hipster area of Toronto. I can't comment on the rest of the menu but it's all tapas style plates- ideal for sharing. Brilliant craft brew pub if you fancy a refreshing one on a summer's day."}
{"text":"Come for the patio, people. It is a very pleasant atmosphere and teeming with life, though that might not be what you want because you will inevitably need to wait a bit and share a table with strangers like we did on Sunday evening. The people really fill the space up. They have a decent beer list, as you might expect from a brewery, so no matter what your style you will find something to enjoy. For food, we did not try much, but we did share a chicken pot pie. It came out piping hot and was delicious but super small, not as much filling as I would hope. It's worth a shot but not quite the star of the block, I say try Te down the street instead."}
{"text":"TLDR: Great beers, intimate setting. _____  Visiting a local brewery whenever I'm traveling is at the top of my list. Luckily I had my bud Kris U (of Yelp Toronto GTA fame) available to take me around to some breweries on a cold Toronto night. He brought me here last, and this ended up being my favorite.  No flights, but they have 4oz pours (only two at a time)...I got a few to taste the breadth and depth of their menu.  IPA - cloudy and juicy. I love these hazy, juice bombs and this was a delight.  Sour - with notes of melon and super juicy. Not traditionally something I'd go for, but the description won me over and I'm glad I ordered it.  Stout - chocolatey good! Thick, robust...and a nice way to round out this tasting.  Place was dimly lit and cozy. I can see this being a dope date spot. It's not huge, but they a good amount of seating. I believe the serve food too, but we were too late and they were no longer serving food.  Overall they had some awesome beers - sever was super friendly - and it was a great way to end the evening."}
{"text":"I been wanting to check out Bellwoods Brewery for months, never have a chance until now as it is open for the first time on a Tuesday!  Patio with picnic tables and a huge BBQ does give the place a rustic feel...   No wait for anything as I dropped by at 6 pm which it just opened!  I am of course not here for the food..  as I always have beer on my mind. Bellwoods Brewery does have a surprisingly good selections, 8 different ones on draft which are all brewed on site: Ale, IPA, Porter, Dubbel, IPA, Saison, priced from $6.50 a pint.  Love sitting right at the bar and watch all the action and have interaction with the bartender. (there are even hooks underneath the table for your purse!)  Too bad, there are no bottles I can pick up to share with my Yelp friend.. maybe I have to drag him down for a tasting to find out which one would be our favourite!!"}
{"text":"Such great food, and excellent service! Quite a hipster joint though; long lines of plaid shirts and (fake) geeky glasses to get in. However, the restaurant does a great job in moving the line fast.   Prices are worth it for the superior beer that they serve. Unreal beer- they even have one called \"Stay Classy\" which has 2.8%; perfect for casual afternoons where you can't drink too much. Their cheese plate is amazingggg; so is their steak.   The only minus about Bellwoods is how cramped it feels sometimes. It needs to expand! We spoke to the owner and he seems like a genuine family man. He's the type of entrepreneur that I am happy to support with my love of craft beer."}
{"text":"I like Bellwoods' beer, a lot. And I can't blame them that they have a great patio in a convenient location.  But waiting in line for a bar? I don't get it and I refuse to do it.  Like everything good in Toronto, it's pretty clear there's an underserviced market here.  I hate to pull it out, but \"when I lived in New York\" I never had to wait in line at a bar because there were enough of them around.  I've basically stopped even trying to come here for anything except the retail counter. A couple years ago you could waltz in at an odd hour but that seems all but impossible now.  5 stars for beer and patio, -1 star for the shit show of a scene. (Bros and basic girls, both in tanktops and Ray Bans.)"}
{"text":"Today I accidentally took the route home that passed Ossington... it seemed only natural to drop in for a bottle to go. The crazy cat lady beer is no more, beautiful belgian style heavy craft brew. I love that Bellwoods Brewery usually have a single hopped beer available. Then it is possible to taste the individual unique hop, hopping up the barley water yeasted.   I am glad I walked the correct way home and looking forward to cracking the cold one when the time calls for it. Hope they don't all switch to cans: There's something more romantic about big bottles. Spring and summer, maybe cans for convenience would be a'right.   Keep on keeping on bellwoods brewery!  Cheers."}
{"text":"Beer 5/5: many choices, great fresh beers.  Food 3/5: not a food place. Some interesting stuff but its a brewery  Service 5/5: helpful, friendly, invested  Location 5/5: central street, parking ob the street  Price 4/5: fair  Will be BACK."}
{"text":"I dig Bellwoods! They brew a number of different styles right in their location on Ossington, all quite tasty. I particularly enjoyed their Saison. The food is good, nothing too special, this is a spot to come for beers and if you're hungry the food is good. But it's not a good only destination in my mind.   The patio is GREAT. Definitely a great spot for a summer drink, come early as seating is limited."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto for a couple days for the first time and heard great things about this place so I dropped by. Came here around 9 or 10 at night and the place was pretty packed. Got to sit at the bar. I love the decor and atmosphere of the place. Tried two beers and they were both really good. Also got the fries which was delicious as well. Would love to come back again if I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a sour beer, Jelly King, and was not disappointed. Great evening patio vibe."}
{"text":"Love the upstairs seating for people watching :) The meat and cheese boards are great if you're feeling peckish."}
{"text":"A nice place to have a beer.  The patio is pretty big with lots of seating. But sharing tables is a norm so you can end up sitting right next to a stranger. Not my fave.  They also only have beer, no wine at all. Also not my fave."}
{"text":"On my annual visit to Toronto for TIFF, my first question to my husband after booking our flight and accommodations is \"when can we go to Bellwoods?\"  We've been here three times now, all at different times and on different days. The most recent visit was a Thursday night and the place was packed! We were lucky enough to get the perfect table where we could hang out and get some beers and delicious snacks. The beer is always great and so is the food. On the most recent visit, we ordered the fries and rye berry salad. I have to say, the salads here are always so much better than they have a right to be. The ingredients are fresh and the combinations of flavors are creative and really tasty.   As much as I love the beer and food, I love the atmosphere even more. When the weather is nice, there's a cute patio area and huge garage doors that open to allow fresh air to come in. The bar itself is pretty small, although it does have quite a few seats. Luckily there are lots of tables and the wait staff regularly make their rounds, so once you're seated, if you find your glass empty, it won't be for long.   There's also a small retail space right next door where you can pick up merchandise printed with their super cute logos or some bottles to take home. Just writing this I'm already excited to go back next year!"}
{"text":"Bellwoods Brewery is a wonderful bar that will surely impress who ever you bring there. You can sit outside, but if you want to impress a friend, ask to sit upstairs - the view of the brewery will surely excite them."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 5 because the food and beers were great. But there was a big miscommunication with the very over worked host so we waited over an hour to get our table so it only gets a 4. They don't serve food outside but you can get drinks which causes a lot of confusion. Not sure why they can't serve food outside? From a gluten free standpoint...got the broccoli salad (waitress was great and came back to check about the fried chick peas which we had put on the side), chickpea salad (best thing we had!) and buffalo chicken sausage. My bro and I also split the meatballs and fries. The dry hopped sour, Jelly King, is awesome! Overall left very happy and satisfied with the food"}
{"text":"*The* patio.   Yes, you already know it. You've waited in line for sun, craft beer and charcuterie. Most of you love it, some of you hate the summer lines, but you're all drawn to it.   I'm less interested in discussing their restaurant and patio, and much more into their bottle shop. Bellwoods brews are thoughtful local beers, and according to people who drink a lot of beer, they know their way around hops. I can't speak to that, but I can say they definitely know their way around pretty packaging and adorable names.   The beautiful little bottle shop is open until 11pm daily. Imagine a Wine Rack for beer in terms of availability... only you actually like the products. Hooray."}
{"text":"Located right in the heart of Trinity-Bellwood. Along the street of Ossington, mingled with other unique restaurants ranging from Asian to Italian..behind the old rustic garage door, there is this hidden gem. A fantastic place for good food, good drinks(amazing), good company...if you are looking for a good time, this is where it's at.  Their fried chicken is out of this world, savoury spices that makes you want to take the next bite before you even swallow your first. Crunchy, flavourful, and juicy..that's how I would describe this simple dish.  Beer...no need to say more. It's a brewery!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bellwoods in all seasons, and regardless of season the beers on tap are always ridiculously good!  In the summertime it can be difficult to get a table (especially if you have a large-ish party), but not impossible. Groups of two get seated pretty quickly, but the wait isn't terrible for larger groups (and well worth it).   The food is also pretty delicious, though a bit pricey. I can strongly recommend their fries, seasonal salads, and asparagus."}
{"text":"Fantastic varieties of beer. Its small and gets really busy in the Summer. They make so many great beers you really have to try them all. They do a great job with some of the stronger beers such as The Hellwoids a Russian Imperial stout or the Boogie Monster an extremely tasty Imperial IPA. I love the Wizard Wolf, I love saying Wizard Wolf as much as I love drinking it, its like something out of a Harry Potter or George RR Martin novel, its a fantastic slightly hoppy andcitrusy session ale. As far as food goes we are vegetarians so not a huge number of options, we usually go with the Assorted cheeses or daily bread as a snack. To me this place us all about the beer so I don't want to fill up on a heavy meal."}
{"text":"One of my favourites in Toronto, although I have a lot of favourites. The patio is like a small garden size area. When it's too sunny, they put up a roof. It's my favourite because I've had really good memories at Bellwoods. It's been my place for really, really good conversations over beers.  I sat inside downstairs before. I also sat upstairs before. And of course we sat outside at -10 degrees!! It wasn't winter, it was April but the temperature just wouldn't go up! I was wearing my down jacket and the heater was out. Service is always good!  I love the flexibility of ordering half pints and sample sizes. Overall this is really my favourite place for beers on Toronto west side. Food is just ok, not great."}
{"text":"Service was on point... the beers are astoundingly good, as were the food items I tried (especially the chicken pot pie)."}
{"text":"The best micro brewery in Toronto. I have been here twice now and loved it each time. Unfortunately I can't recommend a specific beer as I tried to wade myself though the beer menu and ended up absolutely hammered! (I'm British, that's what we do) anyway, I can remember the farmhouse ale being an outstanding beer. The food is pretty good too. The fries are very tasty and accompanied the beer well and I also had the jalapeño duck hearts which are probably the spiciest food I've ever eaten, yet they still remained very tasty. Looking back, the beer is probably best used as something to sit and appreciate rather than have a blow out session with as it is very rich and I was quite fragile the next day.  Brilliant atmosphere, it's a very dark dim-lit place that's very relaxing. Expect a wait for a table. The first time I went I went with 3 other guys and we needed up sharing a table with two strangers which we wasn't bothered about.  Even in winter the beer patio is a great place and they use it as a sort of holding pen for guest waiting for a table, we even had service while we waited. Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what bothered me more, their mediocre beer, overpriced appetizers or the never ending lineup in front of the door, anyways I kept going back to Bellwoods Brewery a few times because I thought it was a cozy little place where I could chill with friends and have some craft beer... until the awful experience last night; I had called them to reserve a table but there was a message playing on the phone saying they didn't take any reservations, so we went there and there was the usual lineup, but surprisingly they kept people waiting under the rain outside, while there were empty tables which obviously were reserved for someone... in addition to their favouritism, the way they were handling the waiting list was just awful, no order, no respect to the customers, they even didn't allow people to wait under the roof where there was plenty of space. I don't think I'll ever waste my time going there."}
{"text":"Food was good and unique.  Definitely go for the duck hearts if you like peppered meat.  They were out of the IPA when we were there :(   but the Monogamy was really good.  Service was good.  Not a fan of the shared table thing."}
