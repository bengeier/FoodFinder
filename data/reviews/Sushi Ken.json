{"text":"I have been here multiple times although mostly for takeout. The rolls are awesome.  Never have to wait long for my order.  I like that they have gluten free soy sauce but the price per packet seems a little high.   Good quality food and portions."}
{"text":"Obivously here in Phoenix, we can't get top grade sushi, so this place is okay. (I usually do not order sushi but other dishes)  The quality of the food is bearable but the service you get, not so. It seems from other reviews this place does this quite often to its customers but my girlfriends I went for a brief lunch on Friday and asked to have our bill split.  When the old Japanese waitress heard that, she got really irritated and said \"we'll add tip to your bill\".  WHAT?? for splitting a check you have to add on the gratuity?  Since there were four of us, we thought, okay whatever.  When it was time for us to order, some of us were bit hesitant trying to decide and the waitress got all frustrated and showed it on her face like she didn't want to be there. OMG, it wasn't like the place was crowded with customers, she had only two other tables and she was working with another waitress.  And after we ordered, she NEVER CAME BACK to our table!!!!  When the food came that was the only time she came back to give us our food, and never came back to check on our drinks or to see if we needed anything.  Fortunately the other young waitress came and tried to tend to our table which was nice of her.  Finally the bill came and she wrote everything down on one sheet and total was like around $59.xx for four of us, and she added 11.80 for tip.  So I asked her if it was cutomary for them to add 20% gratuity.  Then she rolls her eyes and goes \"it's 18%, not 20%\"  What?  I may not be a math genius but that is about 20% not 18% that she claimed.  My girlfriends and I did not want to make a big deal out of 2% difference so we left it at that.  But to be honest, I did not want to leave any tip for her.  I couldn't believe they tagged on gratuitiy simply because we asked to have our bill split.  This was the second visit we wished we had our lunch somewhere else.  I guess we're not coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  It has an enormous menu (almost overwhelmingly large) and very reasonable prices.  It gets quite busy on the weekends (and for good reason!).  My advice is come for lunch or early dinner and you won't be disappointed.  My favorites are the ramen, the gyu don and the chunky spicy sushi rolls.  Frankly they did have a bit of an issue with service in the past.  To their credit they've hired new servers and more servers and it isn't an issue any more.  Bottom Line: Best sushi and ramen in the valley"}
{"text":"The service is very bad. And recently they changed their chef. The food quality and quantity went way down. And with these situation they actually drove up their price!!! Hugh disappointment."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Will never go back!!! Food was just okay. Such a waste of money and time. The restaurant was not the cleanest as well."}
{"text":"Been to many many sushi places across the country. Great neighborhood sushi restaurant. Reasonably priced.  I have been to places like Roka Akor (delicious) but at $100+ a person... Not something I want to do every time I want sushi.  sakana's is a great place also in Ahwatukee with a little livelier place. Tried Sushi Eye the other day shortly after they opened... Will have to give them another chance.  RA's would not bother unless you think California rolls is \"real\" sushi.    Sushi Ken is a great neighborhood restaurant.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I live just down the road from Sushi Ken, and I am definitely a regular. I also live down the street from Ra, and there aren't two restaurants which could be more opposite! Sushi Ken is  family owned and operated, very starkly decorated, and usually filled with asian families (and often screaming children). So if you're seeking a hip, trendy, sushi scene, then you probably should head down the street to Ra. However, if you want authentic Japanese food and fresh, inexpensive sushi (and possibly a wait to be seated) then head on over to Sushi Ken.  There was a point when I was eating here 2-3 times a week! I also made a point of systematically trying everything on the menu, and I can recommend it all. Almost. I wasn't a fan of the ginger beef dish. I don't even know if that's still on the menu...  I have a Japanese friend who first introduced me to the cuisine in college, and when Sushi Ken first opened I told her she had to go. Sure enough, she fell in love with the place and now makes a weekly trek (even though she lives and works in North Phoenix!) I think this shows the authenticity of the place -- there are so many authentic Japanese dishes on the menu that you won't find at a typical sushi restaurant. For example, she loves to order sanma (a whole fish steamed, mackerel I believe), which she said she hadn't eaten since she last visited Japan.   Now, as for my favorites. For lunch - you can't beat the price of makanouchi.  It's this HUMONGOUS bento box filled with a variety of  yummy delights (great for when you can't decide what to get). Tuna sashimi, cooked salmon, tempura, 3 california rolls, an egg roll, squid salad, seaweed salad, karokke (breaded potato cake), pickled vegetables, two pieces of tamago (sushi omelette), a wonton, and rice. All for $7.50!! It's a steal, especially since makanouchi costs nearly twice as much at dinner.    Oh, and did I mention every lunch special comes with soybeans or salad and miso soup? As if the meals themselves didn't already fill you to the brim!   I have a sister who is one of the pickiest people I know. My friend Eric is probably the pickiest person I know. I've taken both of them to Sushi Ken, and both of them ordered the teriyaki chicken, and both of them loved it.  And both are eager to go back! So, it's also a great place to take a crowd, since they have something for even the pickiest of eaters.   Also, I love their tuna tataki roll -- lightly seared tuna, with ginger and scallions. Absolutely delicious. All of their sushi is fresh, and they certainly beat the prices of all the other sushi restaurants in the area.  I'm also a fan of the iced green tea - and the servers know me well enough to just leave a pitcher on the table. :)  The servers, and Ken himself, work extremely hard  -- at one point, when the restaurant first opened, there was just two servers and one of them told me that they had not taken a day off in 72 days!! Luckily, they seem to have done well enough to hire many new servers, and an extra sushi chef, and the original gals don't seem as overworked.  There have been times when I've gone on a random Thursday night and had to wait a good 30 minutes in line before being seated. This isn't extremely unusual at peak hours at Sushi Ken, although since they have hired more help it seems the waiting has gone down some. They won't seat people unless the server can immediately attend to you, which is why there will be several tables open and no one is being seated at them.    I have yet to find another restaurant in the east valley which comes close to Sushi Ken in terms of quality of food and price."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than their mediocre food turns out to be their completely rude and condescending staff.   I have given Ken's more business than they ever deserved over the past couple of years solely due to it's close proximity to home and work. The experience I had there last weekend will certainly be my last.   In the past I had ordered things which didn't taste that fresh, one particular time I ordered Uni (sea urchin), a favorite of mine. I will forego any comparisons in taste for the sake of the weary, but let's just say it was horrible. So, I politely sent it back, only to be told when the waitress returned that Uni was not in season.... So, I should naturally know this? Hmmm... How about you just apologize and not blame the customer for foolishly eating what you served??  The experience this past weekend was very similar, the spicy Yellowtail tasted like it had been left in Tupperware in the sun for a day or two, so I politely sent it back. I was told that perhaps Yellowtail isn't my fish, as though I had never had a bite of sushi before in my life.  Apparently at Ken's, the customer is always wrong. Be warned, go elsewhere, like Sushi Eye or one of several others in the area who serve quality food without insult."}
{"text":"We live in Paradise Valley and drive all the way to Sushi Ken for the best tasting Tempura udon and yummy rolls.  My kids also love their kids menu!  This place reminds me of the Japanese places we used to go to when we lived in San Jose, CA."}
{"text":"Besides being one of the better ramen shops in the valley this place is not worth the visit.  There are much better sushi places around the valley.  I like others also experience horrible service, and given them multiple chances.  I totally understand bad service when you are trying to do things quick and efficiently, and the place is packed.  Maybe I'm just use to cultures where they don't value service, but value being fast and efficient.  But I draw the line when the place is maybe half full and we have sat down for over 20 to 30 minutes without even asking us what we want to drink.  While I'm a regular user of Yelp.  This has been the first time I've ever posted on Yelp because no place has actually gotten me so angry about them.  Also I've never played the race card before, but I truly believe that the servers there might be racist."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing. And the other dishes are really good, especially the ramen, udon, beef sukiyaki, and the salmon collar. Service is really friendly, and it's a good place to take kids."}
{"text":"Great affordable place when I am craving sushi. I love their rainbow roll, it's larger than many other places."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We waited over an hour for our food to come out after our order was taken. There was never any explanation or apology for our order running late until I got up to cancel it. Sushi is just ok. Not worth an hour's wait. We won't be back. Sayonara Sushi Ken."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. To start with I should have listened to the bad reviews, also when we walked in I should have left due to the strong fish smell.   The place is really out dated inside which I don't mind but to start with I ordered the chicken teriyaki and me and my lunch date shared a California roll. First they started with this soup that was disgusting, as well as the salad was just lettuce and a ginger dressing. When the food came they serve some strange things with the chicken. The chicken was very bland I didn't taste any flavor. I literally took 1 bite, When the waiter came by I asked him to take the plate away and please take it off my bill. He said because I had already ordered it he couldn't take it off but he could take half off. That really rubbed me the wrong way.  Second the California roll was not edible. My lunch date didn't like her dish either. We spent 25$ and only maybe had 5 bites. I would suggest to stay far away...don't try this place."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but we stopped going to Sushi Ken many many months ago after many failed visits, after many years of it being a family tradition. Sad but true.  This all broke my heart  - we loved Sushi Ken and will continue to be hopeful that things will get turned around eventually."}
{"text":"Lived in the Ahwatukee for five years, went there AT LEAST twice a month.  Now I live on the other side of South Mountain and still pick it up to go often.   First off, the food offered for the price is ridiculously reasonable...  Second, the sushi is delicious, very well portioned (that's what she said).  Third, it's served by familiar faces who recognize you.   Hamachi Kama and dynamite California rolls for the win!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is terrible.    They say it is because it is busy.  But I think they are just disorganized and unhappy.  I sure hope they get some competition in the area.  Until then, I will probably have to put up with this place if I want Japanese food."}
{"text":"My must go sushi place in phoenix. I have to go there at least once everytime i visit phoenix. Very polite servers, fresh sushi, great katsu curry, and great deal! Even offer drinks, yet to try though."}
{"text":"Haven't been there for a while, but when I walked in, I was excited to see the cleaned up/ redecorated restaurant. Menu is same, staff seem to be friendly... until I got my food. The five dollar sushi was \"WOW, that's $5\" before and now it's \"WOW, they are charging $5 for that?\" Tiny portion and not even hand rolled like it used to be. (Sushi doesn't taste the same if it's molded). I asked if it has changed the owner and got the positive response. I informed the waitress that the food taste different and was disappointed. She insisted the chef and the staff are the same. Well, it sure doesn't taste like it!! Raman was over cooked, instant noodle would taste better and cheaper. Tempura was oily and soggy (temperature issue when fried), sashiime was 3 piece of lumpy fish that I didn't even know it was sashime. Btw, I just read someone's review about their sashime being FROZEN, i had the opposite problem, mine was warm. What kind of sashime is served warm?! I ended up leaving the place hungry and disappointed. I guess I can save myself the trouble of driving all the way there for good meal now."}
{"text":"Open on Christmas, YEA!  Good food & $. Would be four stars: Interior is awful with dirty carpeted floors, handwritten signs EVERYWHERE, one TV on in background with no sound, no music..."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Service is friendly and fast. Prices are pretty good, basically what you would expect for sushi. They do have some pretty good specials though. Small place so not much to say about atmosphere."}
{"text":"WAY low prices, and very decent sushi.  They almost always have toro, which is a big plus in my book, and it's actually inexpensive in relation to other sushi places, which makes it even better.  Most importantly, the sushi has always been fresh.  I've never ordered off the regular menu, and I've always sat at the bar, so I can't speak to the service other than the sushi chef, and his service is consistently good.  This place consistently passes my \"tea test\" with flying colors (iced tea glass is refilled at 3/4 empty at a minimum, and never allowed to go dry).  The plating certainly isn't the most elegant or artistic, but the fish is fresh and tasty and the prices are low, so that offsets the visual appeal (or lack thereof).  If your usual idea of sushi is a place with sleek, modern decor, thumping music, expensive eats and lots of 20-somethings slamming sake bombers (can you say Ra?), this is not the place for you.  Sushi Ken is hidden behind some other buildings in a strip mall, and absolutely lacks ambiance.  Nonetheless, the fact that I have often been the only patron with round blue eyes lends credence to my opinion that the food is \"authentic\" (for whatever that's worth) and well-prepared."}
{"text":"So I finally came back to try the Japanese dishes for dinner. I got the Chiken Katsu Donburi for $8.50. It was a huge bowl and definitely got my moneys worth because I could barely finish even half of it. My fiance got the Spicy Miso Ramen with Mini Gyudon combo for $11. The soup base was good, but the meat was not as good and I wish there was more noddles. And yet again, a large portion of food for a good price. We also got the Melon Cream Soda, so we made it out of the restaurant for $25 total.  Overall, the best ramen I've had in the city, minus the meat, and all for a good price. I didn't try the sushi again for fear of not being happy again. If you come hear, stick to the Japanese food, not the sushi (regardless of the vast selection)."}
{"text":"This place was a mess!  I went here for lunch under a reccomendation from a friend...he was not a friend:)  Walking into the restaurant, the atmosphere was very cafeteria like with the white walls and bright lights, I was not feeling it. I did like the fact that this restaurant was owned by Japanese not Korean, this is rare to find in Phoenix:) I remained optimistic, until I looked at the menu.  They had soooo much going on, it was hard to narrow down what there specialty was.  I good restaurant should always have a specialy. After about 15 min of looking at their menu, and the lunch special menu, and the sushi menu, and the special lunch menu board...I ordered... Uni-  Not fresh Sashimi assorted- Not fresh, cut is very thick Tempura- Not crispy, soggy Cold Somen noodles- bad texture, over cooked Miso soup- Made from powder, not paste Sushi Rice-  Not bad  Overall, this place is a no go....why oh why are good sushi/japanese restaurants so limited in Phoenix?!?"}
{"text":"Of all the places of Sushi I have been to, Sushi Ken stays as my favorite from the beginning to the end. However, I would usually be happy to give this place 5 stars, but for some reason, I'm a bit unhappy.  Pros: Sushi Ken's fish is extremely fresh, and the waiters show their best behavior when serving us. Unfortunately, the waiters strain a little to keep up with the constant ordering (this place is exasperatingly crowded during dinner time) and I give them credit for that. You can save A LOT OF MONEY if you look at any of the whiteboards posted along the walls of the restaurant. We ordered the Hamachikama entrée(??-steamed yellowtail, at least that was what I found when I looked it up). It includes a giant piece of cooked yellowtail with radish, a crispy California roll, pieces of tuna sashimi, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and an orange for only about $14. It even comes with your choice of soup or soybeans. It's a lot to eat, and we can hardly finish it when two people share the lot. The sushi boats are also decent for their size, though they can be extremely pricey, since one boat costs $60(and in case you're wondering, you don't keep the boat.) The hot/cold soba (or ramen) comes with a mini chirashi on the house (you can choose something different) for $15. They also serve certain rolls for only $5, and all of these are listed in the whiteboards (besides the boat). The bathrooms are fairly decent as they keep them clean, and for some reason, I noticed a Febreeze bottle sitting on top of the toilet tank even though there is an air freshener plugged into the wall. No wonder it smelled like baked cookies in there.  Cons: Unfortunately, their location is small, and due to the popularity of the restaurant, there can be a bit of a waiting time. There is a rip in the carpet, but that doesn't influence my eating in any way. They only have one cashier, so sometimes I see a huge pile of checks on the table next to the cash register. Unless you're a SERIOUS regular/friend of theirs, they don't have the time to greet or say goodbye to you. The staff are extremely rushed, but they do treat every customer equally. They simply need to expand their location, hire more workers, and get more tables.   Obviously, I'm coming back. This is the best sushi restaurant in my area, even though it is very cramped inside. I highly recommend this place to anyone who reads this. But come early, because like I said...it's crazy in there during 7-8 pm."}
{"text":"I have to give them one extra star because I do really enjoy their ramen."}
{"text":"To be honest I was apprehensive to try sushi ken at first. It's unassuming location close to a dry cleaner in a strip mall doesn't overwhelm one with the assumption of great cuisine. But...I was wrong. Their food is great...and the prices are equally awesome. I had a huge pork ramen bowl about a month ago and it was awesome. The portion size was huge!  almost ridiculous actually...I probably got through half of it! Not to mention the fact that the entree came with California rolls and a small side salad...all for around 10 bucks! I will definitely be going again...I will just maybe not eat anything like...a day or so beforehand so as to have a fair shot at finishing my food!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in Ahwatukee. Good atmosphere with great service. Love the chicken curry."}
{"text":"This is a great \"hole in the wall\" sushi restaurant.  Forget the overpriced food of Ra or a Teppan grill.  Sushi Ken provides fresh and quality sushi at a reasonable price.  My wife and I come here regularly for date nights.  Their happy hour selections include a number of rolls and drinks.  Due to the intimate nature of the restaurant,  they seat about 20 tables so maybe 50 people total.  My advice is to not come during dinner rush (6p-8p) because this place gets packed and can easily be an hour or more wait but you can also jump into an open seat at the sushi bar and avoid waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently changed ownership and the vibe and food quality are noticeably different.  Service was prompt and courteous, but taste was not as fresh as before.  Perhaps the new team will get it back in time."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Great quality!!!  The sushi and also the kitchen good are both wonderful. Service is good they are short staffed it seems,but the servers work hard and do their best. Although the service may be slow it's totally worth it for the food!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service very bad. Food very very slow. 40 minutes to get one out of 12 food to come out. Another 30 minutes before most of what we ordered came. Asking for the check took 15 minutes. Friend ordered beer and they forgot about it. Waiters need to retake training and kitchen staff needs to chop chop. Food was good and thats it. If you need good service dont cone here.  TL;DR horrible horrible service. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because the food was good."}
{"text":"**Updated March 20, 2009** Been there 2 more times. Food is better, but price is still the same. And not the best Sushi. I guess people have to visit more Sushi places in Phoenix, and then Arizona, and then West Coast......... that way you should be able to tell if it is really GOOD sushi or not.  I haven't mentioned East Coast or Asia yet, so yea.   Been there twice and found it deserves a review.. 1st time there- Just moved to Phoenix from Bay Area and was craving for some Sushi. A friend of mine heard me and took me there, saying it is the best sushi in the area. Ordered a sushi combo A or something. The price was good, considering the quality of sushi in the middle of dessert. I was drinking a bit and did not really remember too much, but I remembered it was good enough for me to go back.  2nd time- My girlfriend came to Phoenix for a visit, and we decided to go for sushi (again.) This time, however, was not so impressive. We ordered the sashimi combo, dynamite, saba nigiri and a few other nigiri. The miso soup was like instant soup, and the sashimi was REALLY NOT FRESH. It smells like it has been sitting the the fridge for ages, and we could not finish it. I don't mean to compare with the fishes I've had before, but it was just not acceptable.  General speaking, price is really good, so I will not complain too much. Especially the first time I went, the quality of food was acceptable. But I would not go back for another time, unless I know I am really craving for sushi and can't think of anywhere else."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here.  Service was attentive.  Food excellent and cost very fair. Fish quality was very good and very fresh.  Large sashimi cuts that other places would have halved and served you twice.  Unagi was grilled very well here as well as the ubiquitous rolls were done with panache and also very large portions.   The one downside was the tempura and sashimi combinations. The sashimi was great but the tempura was one prawn, one piece of onion and a pepper type.  Not a great selection for tempura.  Another highlight and an exceedingly good value is the chirashi sushi.  Excellent and wide selection of sashimi placed over rice with shreds of grilled seaweed.   Nice selection of beer and hot and cold sake.  Desserts are available though by the time I finished, I was stuffed."}
{"text":"Can we just keep this between ourselves? They just don't need any more customers to form a line at Sushi Ken.  I lived in Japan for four years. My husband is Japanese, & we've picked apart every sushi restaurant in the East Valley(not on Yelp, though). I should make a list.  This is where we eat sushi. We live @ 40 minutes away & drive in for a meal.(Though with the price of gas...)  In the price:freshness ratio of good sushi, Sushi Ken has it made.  It's like a real Japanese family restaurant. Giant menus with a little of everything on it. Want sushi? Got it! Kids only eat noodles? Got it! Sister-in-law doesn't eat fish? Got it! Just like home, there's something for everyone.   In addition, the sushi is actually good, fresh & plentiful. Plus, if you can read Japanese there's little signs posted around with specialties like negitoro donburi, my favorite.  Here's a little story; We've been married almost 33 years. I'm ashamed to say that until my last trip to Japan in 2004 I didn't like sushi. At the great Tsukigi Fish Market, I ate my first negitoro donburi & fell in love. I even had it as my last meal at the airport before we left Japan, and my husband has taught himself to make it for me at home.(good guy!) It was life changing!  So go to Sushi Ken, and enjoy! But let's just keep it between us so there's still some negitoro for me!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is totally NOT recommended.  My family and I went for lunch.  The food was just so-so (though Gy-don was good).  And the service provided was the worst I have ever had in my life.  The waitress had no smile at all.  When asking for the detail about a food on menu, she acted like you should know what it is.  When delivering the food, she threw the food to table.  My kid was scared because of the sound.  I will never ever go to this restaurant again, even just a step."}
{"text":"Great ramen and donburi. We go there for those instead of their sushi, which is good too. I'd give them a higher rating but their service lacks. We seem to wait just to order every time we go. We also always have to ask for water or drink refills and typically wait well after we're done for check. We go back because their food is good."}
{"text":"Hands down the greatest textbook oriental crafted sushi restaurant in the Ahwatukee area.  As a sushi connoisseur and Arizona native, I've been to most all sushi restaurants in the east valley, usually noting the quality and portion size of the fish.  Sushi Ken delivers: -Superb fish quality -Great variety and specials -Solid roll sizes -Relaxed atmosphere  A+++"}
{"text":"Sushi is always fresh and they give you healthy portions for a great price!  Their hot green tea is excellent.  Sashimi portions are very generous.  My favorite rolls are the Chunky Spicy Yellowtail and Chunky Spicy Tuna...huge rolls (8 pcs) and only $5 each!  My only complaint is that the service can be a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"Sometimes they can get busy and service goes down a bit when that happens, but generally very good.  They have always been pleasant to me.  Have to remember though, it is casual dining.  Good prices, consistently very good (sometimes excellent) sushi.  Wish it was closer so I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"We've been going here since we moved to AZ. One of our favorites! The Donburi is amazing, so are the Ramen soups and Spicy Tuna! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Service was not so good, that's why I gave 3 stars. Food was good not great. Price value wise depending what you order. Lunch special around $10.   If you come with a large group (8 ppl in our group) tips/gratuity will be added. Even if the service is bad."}
{"text":"Food is great. I really enjoy the pork kotsu but the service is terrible. The tall waitress is one of the rudest I have encountered and I believe they are able to do this because of the gratuity policy. I love going to the place but never look forward to all the attitude the staff gives."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo with miso ramen and spicy tuna rice bowl for dinner. Love it! The tuna was tender and they have fresh uni or sea urchins. But the rolls was so-so and they didn't have fresh wasabi. Would come back sometime"}
{"text":"When you walk into an ethnic restaurant, the best thing to see is a bunch of people of that ethnicity sitting at tables. When I walked in with my family, at least 75% of the customers were asian. So, the food is definitely authentic, and delicious.   Everyone comments on the service, and while they don't have an army of waiter staff, the ones they have most definitely are not being lazy or slow. They are just very busy. If you need something, feel free to flag someone down.  In terms of quality, they are phenomenal. I used to live in Hawaii, so I know good Japanese food. This is some of the best I've ever had.   The name might be Sushi Ken, but they are far more than just sushi."}
{"text":"This is like a typical fast-food Japanese restaurant in Japan such as Yoshinoya or similar restaurants that you can find in the subway underground street. The main difference is that they also serve various types of sushi.  It is quite good for the amount of money.  The free california sushi that comes with your entree is not all that great but hey, they don't charge extra for it so what do you expect. Fish quality is acceptable but not extraordinary.  If you really want top quality sashimi you can try sushi hiro or sushi on shea in Scottsdale but expect to pay a lot more for the same dishes.. Sushi Ken is the type of restaurant that I can go every day without going bankrupt.. When I feel like spending more for something more unque I would visit Sushi Hiro.."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. My girlfriend is a big fan because it's inexpensive and good. The last 3 times we've gone the service has been beyond bad, long wait for food, no refills, moody waiters. They just don't care about the customers or good service. I'm sorry to see what used to be a good place lower their service like this"}
{"text":"The sushi is so fresh and reasonably priced, Sushi Ken is a great spot in Ahwatukee. The portions are large and the staff is attentive. I tried the ramen also and it was delicious- I had leftovers for 2 days. My friend had the poke bowl and it looked great. I'm shocked that it's not jam packed every night of the week!"}
{"text":"They always have the best sushi n price in town. BUT they have the worst customer service ever. Waited for 20+ mins to get our order and refill. Added 18%tips for a party of 2 while THEY DO NOT DESERVE IT. Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi place before the management change.  I have been a customer for ten years.   There are problems that needs to be addressed immediately.   1. The water smells awful. Even the tea has a foul odor.  2. The sushi chefs lack proper experience. I have ordered almost every dish on the menu over the ten years of patronage. Under the new management, majority of the sushi dish simply are not made with level of quality. Even the rice tastes different.  They really need good sushi chefs.  3. The portions have been reduced. Try ordering udon dish and you'll see hardly any noodles. 4. There is fish odor when sitting at the sushi bar. This should never be!  5. Cups and dishes are dirty.   Hopefully things will be quickly fixed."}
{"text":"For everyone's sake of a possible future trip to Sushi Ken, let me just tell you now: dont.  1 star for location--close to home 1 star for clean water glass and not bad tasting tap water total= 2 stars.  Notice there are no stars for their food.  I read a number of reviews before coming here and so many people raved about this being the best Japanese food in the valley...well, i can assure that does NOT include their sushi.  That's all i got (they should probably change their name btw!) and it truly was just bad. Yes, it was edible, but hardly.  Another reviewer mentioned that when getting his rolls he didn't pay attention to them making the rolls because he was eating his miso soup and edamame...well i fell prey to this as well. The first part of my spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but the pieces were overly large (4 of them) compared to the other 4...When i finally reached the other 4 pieces i noticed the consistency changed: the rice was hard and chewy and the tuna was dry and just not appetizing. I also ordered a California roll...the crab was dry, the avacado was brown and again, the rice was hard.  Now, Sir who is \"making\" my sushi rolls RIGHT in front of me....how many times did you have to sneak each piece over to complete my order without me seeing/knowing? I saw you make my to-go order fresh--as i watched you the entire time. Not cool.  Do yourself a favor and try another sushi place. I can't speak for anything else but their sushi, but i would NOT recommend this place to one single person. Not even a person i hated. And to be quite honest, i feel as though i should take a star away for as awful as i feel right now--i didn't even finish 2 rolls. There is no reason for me to feel this way....just saying."}
{"text":"Really not a great place to go. Their food is OK, the service is horrible. They never come to refill any drinks without asking, then if we ask, they are not happy to do so. They make us feel like we aren't welcomed to be there. Food is OK and price is OK too, but this is not a restaurant i'd recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"The fact that sushi ken is not already 5 stars on yelp is hog wash. I haven't eaten everything on their menu, I come for the sushi.  Best. Sushi. Arizona. Ever.  Ya, that wasn't really a sentence, but you get the idea. I have gone all around town and tried out sushi but no one matches their big fresh cuts here at sushi ken. And I'm talking real sushi here people, not just california / mexican rolls. Raw Fish. The prices are not cheap but good sushi is never cheap (conveyor belts etc is NOT good sushi). Any true sushi  fan I have brought he has agreed, and begged me to take them back.  Their Ramen is also outstanding. We've been to several ramen only joints here in the valley but none do it as well as sushi ken."}
{"text":"This is super close to home so decided to check it out tonight. I don't see us coming back. Spent $80 and left most of our food on the table because it was so awful. The server never asked how the food was or offered a substitute when dish after dish was untouched after a bite or 2. When asked for something else, was told that was not an option. The only item comped were the Shrimp Shumai because they were still frozen in the center. Will stick to travelling a few miles rather than a quarter mile for a dinner that consisted of stringy and improperly prepared sashimi maguro, the masago was an odd pale orange color with little flavor, the sweet and spicy roll was more cream cheese than anything spicy or appetizing. The cream crab korokke...resembled a deep fried phlegm ball. No flavor and I imagine had comparable texture. Even the California rolls were underwhelming. The only thing we enjoyed were the gyoza, though we had to request a sauce to accompany the dish, they were cold by the time the server returned with about a tablespoon of brown liquid in a bowl."}
{"text":"It used to be my family's favorite place for many years, but  under the new manager the quality of the food has been definitely dropped for last one year.  The tuna and octopus in chirashi were not edible. The octopus was so chewy that my husband had to spit out. The ramen is not Japanese style anymore. They changed the broth and now even added zucchini in it which is a typical sign of non Japanese.  Well, the only good thing about this place is not crowded anymore so that we can always find table even on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick lunch and soon became a fan. This will become my new favorite go to sushi place. Friendly, clean, and amazing sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken used to be my favorite restaurant in the world - every time I came home from long trips, I'd drive straight from the airport to Sushi Ken. I even managed to get a group of 15 high school kids go to Sushi Ken for their homecoming dance dinner when I was in high school 6 years ago (which isn't a small feat, if you consider all the traditional high-school-dance-dinner-venues). Probably visited at least twice a week, when I lived in the Ahwatukee area.  ...What happened? It pains me to only give Sushi Ken a one-star rating, it really does, because half a decade ago I would have recommended them to the President of the United States. For some reason, not only has the food quality diminished in the past few years, the portions have undoubtedly shrunken, and the prices have inflated. Which still isn't the worst part.  I have absolutely nothing good to say about the service. No matter how good a restaurant's food is, if the service cant support the product, it's not worth eating at all.   Sushi Ken is not a friendly atmosphere. Water cups are never refilled. Food takes the entire Paleolithic era to be delivered. The servers used to be flexible with the menu and accommodated for substitution requests; however, now there is a ridiculous 20% upcharge to substitute salmon for tuna. The waitresses make you feel like they hate you and that they dread serving you, no matter how kind you are to them. Perhaps it's because they've implemented a 15% autogratuity policy, regardless of how large the party is, so they can get away with poor service without having to take a cut in profit. It's absolutely ridiculous. The queen of evil servers (the tallish Asian one who never smiles, only scowls), spilled water on my dad one time without so much as an apology. A few weeks later, as she was serving ramen to one of my girlfriends, she spilled half the broth on the tray and completely ignored her mistake.   So I thought I would find a way to bypass the horrible service while still enjoying a Sushi Ken lunch - call in for a takeout order and control my own service in the comfort of my home. I called in for a ramen, and requested that they separate the noodles from the broth in order to avoid them getting soggy (which is the standard for noodle packaging, right?) WRONG. Fifty cent up-charge. OUTRAGEOUS. Now, I get that you're trying to scrimp and save marginal costs, but really? Sacrificing the satisfaction and loyalty of a customer as well as food quality in order to save ONE to-go container that cost maybe fifteen cents max? Bad idea.     Come on, people, you're in the service industry. You're paid to serve. It's not that hard of a job - you smile and greet your patrons, who don't expect much in the first place - all they want is good food (which you have), and an atmosphere that doesn't make the table feel like their server's  going to pounce and maul their faces off.   News flash, Sushi Ken - tips are earned, not obligatory. I once served at a restaurant where autogratuity was forbidden, because management believed that excellent service speaks for itself. If you had to implement an autograt to every single party, big or small, then chances are you KNOW that your Service. Flat. Out. Sucks. People aren't happy to be treated like scum, then forced to pay for it. The solution is simple - revamp your service training protocol, and you'll get your loyal customers back.  To my fellow Yelpers: Avoid at all costs. I'm telling you, boycott this restaurant, and hopefully they'll shape up in the future. Because if not, there's no way Sushi Ken will stay alive in the long run."}
{"text":"Worst Sushi ever! Please stay ways from this place. Had to put tons of wasabi and ginger to be able to finish what we ordered. Good sushi should need neither. Had to go to another place and also get a hard drink to get over the bad taste it left in our mouths"}
{"text":"I've been here many times but will boycott this place now because of my last visit.   I was here during lunch time with my coworkers.  Food was good as usual but service was by far the worst we've EVER been treated!   When the 3 of us finished our meal we paid with 2 different credit cards.   When the receipt came back to us a gratuity was added.   We asked why was gratuity added and they said because they had to spilt up our checks with 2 different credit cards.  WTF... We never have this issue anywhere we go!   It wasn't worth the time to fight this since we had to get back to work anyway.    After the stupid gratuity issue...my coworker had leftovers to bring back, so he grabbed 2 chopsticks to go. One of the waitress saw him grab 2 so she grabbed 1 of the chopstick from his hands and told him that he only needed 1 chopstick!  WOW!  We were so shocked that we had nothing to say to her.    Bye bye Sushi Ken!!!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I OR MY COWORKERS BE BACK FOR YOUR RUDE SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was last Friday night. I came here with my parents, husband, and my two kids -3yrs old and 4months old  The food took 40minutes to come out and the service was really slow and bad. By that time my husband just wanted to go home. And didn't even want to tip them due to their service.   The check came and they included gratitude because we were SIX party. They counted my 4MONTH old baby as a party. (I know he is a human being, but really???) I wanted to talk to the waitress and she walked away while I was talking to her. I want my time and my money back!!!!   Never ever will go back here again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place. Prices have spoiled me for other restaurants. Why try something twice the price when this tastes so good."}
{"text":"The sushi is dirty cheap and good enough for the price.  I can't complain. The nigiri sushi is gigantic and will definitely fill you up fast but the fish is often wet from rushed thawing.  Again, for the price I can't complain.  I CAN however tell you that this service is pretty much the worst in the valley.  I'm not sure if these are just innately terrible servers or they could care less about you because they  have plenty of business that they don't need to please anyone.  The service is extremely slow, very disorganized, uncoordinated and just plain bad. I've been going there for awhile and the service has not gotten better and in fact it's gotten worse.   There are too many places in the east valley for good sushi to have to come here and beg to get your food . Update:  I went back recently and found it to be refreshingly nice to be left alone.  The servers are barely there except to take the order and bring you the food. I guess I will return after all if I just want to be left alone."}
{"text":"I would rate 0 stars but thats not possible. Anyway I went with a couple of friends to find a new sushi spot and everyone always seem to rave about this place but after going here, I truly do not understand the hype. We waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged at our table, granted it was a little busy but still, 20 minutes is ridiculous. On top of that the sushi was expensive for the horrible quality of fish they dared serve me. I paid 11 for a basic roll and it came to me WARM, and the rest of the food was extremely mediocre. And at the end of the meal we waited a whopping 45 MINUTES FOR OUR CHECK AND WE HAD TO ASK FOR IF 3 TIMES! I would write more but this review would be endless but if you ask me, I would said just go to ginban across the street from this terrible place. Way better quality and way better price.  Stay woke."}
{"text":"I am from Boston and there are a lot of good sushi in Boston and NYC ( I also visit often), but this place is absolutely a must-go place for sushi. For the price, it is cheap but at the same time very fresh fish. Ramen are not below average and their katsu curry is absolutely the best I've had so far. I missed its food sooo much (especially the katsu curry) when I was back in Boston. Service is always welcoming and nice (very very polite). As can be seen this is a family run restaurant and there is only one waitress. I personally work part time as japanese food waitress back in Boston and I totally understand how service just simply can not be met when there are over 6-7 tables to be served at the same time (they are often full-house with one waitress). They totally deserve a good tip (or at least a average 15%-20% tips) even though you may not be fully served or at all."}
{"text":"Let me say that I do like the atmosphere of Sushi Ken's.  It's friendly, casual, and feels like what I think a sushi place should feel like.  That said, we ordered some tuna sashimi in order to get a feel for what the quality was like before ordering anything else, and I'm pretty sure that what we were served was shipped in frozen.  It was not good.  We ate it out of respect, and left."}
{"text":"The service can sometimes be lacking and the quality is not quite up there with other sushi places in the area, but for this thrifty lover of sushi you cannot beat Sushi Ken!  My wife and I can order miso soup, edamame and three plates of sushi and walk out playing around $25 with tip.  Best deal in Ahwatukee IMHO!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is great for sushi. They've catered a couple parties for my family and their food is above average for a Japanese restaurant in the valley. The sashimi is really really good, while the rolls were average at best. Nothing special there. The entrees were decent as well. Average japanese food, nothing special.   If you are a fan of sashimi or nigiri, I would suggest this place. If you want good sushi rolls, you may want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"There are not very many great Japanese restaurants in the Phoenix area. So far I think Sushi Ken is my favorite. I hate those upscale hipster rave sushi places. That is not the kind of atmosphere Sushi Ken provides. This is a traditional looking family sushi house and has great service. The menu is very large and the food is not overpriced. I like to get the combo that has ramen soup (several broth choices to choose from) and sashimi. Wow the kids bento is huge! This place is a great little Ahwatukee gem!"}
{"text":"Well, I've had good dining experiences at this location before, but unfortunately I embarrassed myself by recommending it to a friend who attempted to dine there last night. I say \"attempted,\" because she was ignored by the rude wait staff, and ended up leaving after 50 minutes without any service. This is completely unacceptable, Sushi Ken was busy at the time, the level of staffing was supposedly adequate, but apparently it was Asians-only night because those were the only people the staff were serving. Now Sushi Ken will be deprived of not only my friends business, but mine and that of my entire family as well."}
{"text":"Saturday, 12:55 pm. Sushi Ken on Chandler Ave.   We were seated right away. Server brought us our drinks less than 10 mins after we sat.  We got our food 20 mins after we sat. Very satisfactory service for my standards.  Deep Fried Baby Octopus was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Seaweed Salad was fresh. Crunchy Roll was very tasty. Spicy Miso Chashu Ramen was the highlight. Abundant broth, plenty of ramen, bouncing with flavor, and lots of heat.  Shrimp Tempura, California Roll, and Gyoza were unremarkable though. Shrimp was skinny and tough. The roll was dominated by cucumber.   Overall, come for the ramen and the special dishes. Order the staple somewhere else."}
{"text":"I like the food but I hate the service there. It took us 20 mins to wait the seat and another 20 mins to wait for the waitress to come and take the orders. There were several things made us leave the restaurant without order any food. First, when we were ready to order the food, the waitress told us no matter which table gets ready first she has to take the order for who ever comes in the restaurant first. So we have to wait for a 20 people's table until they finished order and got their drink(actually we got there first, but they got table before us because they have more people).This was my first time hear a waitress reject the customer to take their order with this reason. Second, the waitress told my friend who order a bottle of beer that if he shares his beer with other people she will REPORT him. OMG !!! (I cannot believe the waitress would say things with no manner and threaten her customer). Third, she put the beer on the table with a big sound of \"poo\". After all of these impolite, we left the restaurant with only purchasing a bottle of beer."}
{"text":"You would think that living in Seattle, I would have found some good sushi.  I guess I did, but if I really wanted *good* sushi, I had to drive three hours to Vancouver.  Now here I am, moved out to the middle of the desert, and I've found a restaurant to beat the pants off of anything in Seattle.  I know it's a stereotype that if the workers speak the language of cuisine's country, and if half the people there look like they're from that country, it must be a good place.  Well, so far that stereotype hasn't been wrong for me, and Sushi Ken meets it.  When I asked about the negitoro (which I haven't had since living in Japan), the waitress asked the chef if they had any toro, in Japanese.  (The answer was \"nai\") :(  Sad times.  But the negihama is a half decent substitute.  The sushi is delicious, and there are all sorts of varieties of rolls.  I'm a sucker for the yami roll, which I really wonder is \"yummy\" in romaji.  Who cares, it makes me pass out with *nom.*  I've also had the tempura ice cream.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it is still purty gosh durn good.  Really, when it's good, what else can you say?  You can't go wrong with Sushi Ken."}
{"text":"No complaint about the food, they are pretty good, better than a lot of sushi places.  I will never go back to this place again after how they treated us.  Thought it would be busy and we made reservation for a party of three.  Long story short, we were handed the bill with an extra item called \"Reservation Gratuity\", an 18% charge of the total bill.  In my decades of existence and restaurant experiences, I've never heard of reservation gratuity.  Besides, when we arrived, the restaurant was not packed and plenty of tables (at 6pm).  The person on the phone did not mentioned anything about a charge to make reservation.  I've been to restaurants high and low and none has a reservation gratuity.  When we disputed this charge for a party of three, we were not presented with a manager.  May be all the wait people are managers of some sort.  We were told they do that all the time, but we were not told on the phone when making the reservation.  Shady and unprofessional way of doing business.  It's not going to happen again.  I can get just as good sushi somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food is the best authentic Japanese cuisine here in the Valley.  The service is a bit slow and I heard about the extra fee charged for splitting checks, so we put the tab on my friend's card and I paid her back."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles and I come out to AZ every other month. I have been to Sushi Ken many times, and every time I have had terrible service. This last visit was the last straw. The girl who was our server approach us with such a poor attitude and a sour look on her face. Needless to say, we tried not to ask her for much. At the beginning of our order, I notified her that I will need to place a to go order toward the end of the meal. She walked by our table many times, while our water glasses were empty, she never once stop to ask us if we needed anything or just fill our water glasses.   I then asked her nicely, that when she had a chance, could we get some more water. She then said, \"don't you need to place an order to go?\" I said \"yes, but when you bring the water, we can do it then\". She walked over, slammed a pitcher of water on the table and then walked away. I proceeded to serve our table the water, then walked over to the register to place my to go order and pay my bill.  I have never in my life stiffed a waitress. However, in this case it was necessary. The waitress followed me out to the parking lot and asked me where I had left the tip.   I told her that expecting a tip for NOT doing your job is not the way it goes. T.I.P. means \"To Insure Promptness\" and since I did the job for her, she did not deserve a tip.  The unfortunate thing, is that the sushi is actually good and affordable. I might suggest take-out for this place."}
{"text":"WOW... Their sushi was amazing.. Definitely coming back for more. The service was attentive but on the quiet side. They took and brought our orders quickly :) we were happy with our experience here at Sushi Ken."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I am a Japanese. I grew up in Japan, so I know what real Japanese food is like. This is the only place that I found that serves real Japanese food that I grew up with. They have lunch special on weekends, which you can order M-Thurs dinner time as well. Lunch special are very inexpensive and lots of good food. They also have $5 sushi rolls special that is great. They have about 6-7 different kinds of rolls, that are $5.  I am not a raw fish person, but I can eat some. I love every dish they serve there. I go there at least twice a month, even though I live about 25 min away. The owner and most of the waitresses are Japanese which is hard to find lately at Japanese restaurants. They are very friendly and lately, there is no wait. It used to be a wait if I go on Fri or Sat night like 2 years ago, but not anymore. There is a flat screen TV with cable, so when I bring my Husband he enjoys ESPN. They are always so nice to my little toddlers. so lunch specials are about $7 to $9 each, and dinner is about $8-$15 or so. Their menu shows all the pictures of dishes, so if you are not familier with Japanese food, it is a good one to go to."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, mostly for sushi.  The portions are very generous, the sushi is good quality and seems very fresh.    Service is friendly and quick.    If you order the \"boat\" be sure to come hungry.    We keep meaning to try the non-sushi entrees, but haven't gotten to it yet."}
{"text":"OUR FAVORITE SUSHI IN TOWN!  If you want traditional Japanese cuisine, skip the fancy \"sushi\" bars and head to Sushi Ken.  We visit a few times a month.  You will find great service and an incredible menu. Their sashimi is to die for.  The hamachi is always fresh and buttery.  I can't say enough about their rolls.  They serve traditional cold and hot noodles, great bentos, Chirachi and even Korean Kalbi.  You will always find affordable combos.  They have a great selection of Japanese beers and sake.  Last time we were there the kids could barely finish their meal because the portions are so generous.  But they still had a second helping of miso because it is SO YUMMY!  Another thing to note, it is always packed with Oriental families.  That is always a good sign.  In the past year that we've been going there, we have never encountered any problems.  Thank you Sushi Ken!"}
{"text":"We visited Sushi can yesterday and we had a very pleasant meal. They have remodeled somewhat, and the menu has changed. Very good food Quick Service friendly I was very happy. Check them out"}
{"text":"I wish I can give no stars today my mom and I went to have lunch saw the reviews before seemed like a good place. We get there order are food and this where everything starts going down hill. I ordered a bento box and my mom order a sashimi tempura combo. The waiter brings out the salad and soup for my mom and the salad has no dressing after about couple of minutes go by we call the waiter over to ask him where the other soup and my edamame is and in addition why their wasn't dressing on the salad also note lettuce looked tired. So we get the soup. Then the first meal comes which is my moms didn't look anything like the photo which fine ok. After waiting sometime for my meal ask the server where is my meal he goes to the manager and the cook. After comes up to explaining that the chef and  sous chef messed up the order and then begins to tell me that if he was a customer I would've not said anything about the food being late like basically telling me to shut up and keep waiting. I've never ever in my life have ever had any server tell me this how dare an establishment allow a server to say/ even work there is crazy. Never got to try the sushi at all walked out after he said that stupid comment. I will never go there again. The nerve of some people."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. The service was amazing and I will definitely be coming back. If you're thinking about going, do it!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is completely unassuming.  From the looks of the outside, with its neon beer signs, etc. I thought what kind of place are they taking me to... but after seeing the extensive menu and tasting the yummy cold soba (with its slippery goodness) and surprisingly fresh for the desert sushi, I was hooked.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix, this is one of my top choices for lunch.  They have some great special lunch deals as well. I haven't had dinner here, but it seems like more of a lunch destination to me in terms of atmosphere."}
{"text":"50mins to receive two orders of ramen and 1.5hrs to be served sushi is ridiculous. What's more ridiculous is the fact that we actually waited patiently all that time. This place has gone down hill since being taken over by new owners. A long wait is the norm here but that was only worth it as loyal customers to the original owners.   To speak to the food quality...The noodles in the ramen were over cooked, soggy and had absorbed the over salty broth, turning the noodles the bronze color of the broth. The bamboo shoot in the ramen was also soggy as if the entire bowl of ramen had been sitting for 30min before serving it to us. I would have thought this was the case but the broth was very hot when served.   The previous owners kept the Japanese tradition of high quality and great attention to detail. It was obvious that they cared deeply about sharing their Japanese heritage with the community. Now, it's just becoming the run of the mill Japanese restaurant like every other in town. Eventually fading into the sea of Asian restaurants before closing its doors for good."}
{"text":"What a neighborhood gem.  Great food, great prices, good service, what else can you ask for?  I mean, arriving to a packed place and half of the customers seem to be Japanese, which speaks highly about a sushi joint imho.  Will be back for sure.  Cheers"}
{"text":"DO NOT TIP THIS PLACE! They include the tip in the statement and DON'T TELL YOU. Furthermore the customer receipt EVEN INCLUDES A PLACE FOR YOU TO TIP. I was dumbfounded to see how my $10 even meal became $12.90 on the receipt. They must really love patting themselves on the back because AZ sales tax is only 5.6% which makes this a 25% tip!  Onto the food. I've been to this place twice. First time I ordered a cha shu ramen. The noodles and the char siu  tasted very authentic but the broth was remarkably plain. It tasted like something I'd improvise at home if I only had leftover noodles. It also didn't include extra ingredients you'd expect like a soft-boiled egg.  Second time I ordered a korokke curry. This dish really puzzled me, the curry was as thin and almost as flavorless as water, the korokke was hard and tasted like they added no salt to the potatoes at all, and the rice was overcooked. Japanese rice is characteristically soft as it is but it tasted like they cooked it a good half an hour longer than they should have.  The food is really bizarre. I can tell from the people speaking Japanese and the ingredients that this is supposed to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, but it's almost like they've never been taught how to cook it properly. If it was just for the food and service I'd give this place a 3 star, but the tip scamming really miffs me. I don't expect to ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Japanese food. You see many Asians eating here,  it must be good . I would also like to add, they Service be really bad at times. Very slow today. Sunday at lunch time."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is my go to for sushi in Arizona. The food is delicious, no doubt about that in my mind. However two things about this restaurant bother me a lot.... like a lot a lot.   1. The interior is absolutely bland, borderline disgusting. It's basically one giant room filled with dim lighting, a dirty ceiling, and an awkward looking bar/kitchen area. I've never heard any atmospheric music being played, the carpet is ugly, the furniture is boring and dark, and there is no privacy offered by the interior design. It feels like you're out in the open for everyone to watch, yet I can never get the waiters attention which brings me to my next point.  2. The service SUCKS! If anyone that works here is reading this, please note that your service is terrible and try to fix it! No one ever greets you when you walk in, so you are left to stand awkwardly at the front of the restaurant until you're lucky enough for a waiter to notice you. The waiters are never friendly, never smile, and never there when you need. If this restaurant just improved their service, I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Ken a countless number of times during the time I've resided in Ahwatukee. It's a great value and an excellent option if you're looking for good Japanese cuisine.  To be honest, I rarely have sushi when I come here -- I usually get one of the Donburi bowls (whether it be chicken, beef, or pork). The rice bowls contain tremendously hearty portions and always fill me up. The food is flavorful and the setting is perfect for a group of people. When I've had sushi here, it's been delicious as well.  If you're looking for a well-rounded meal, I'd recommend Sushi Ken over Mido Sushi, Teharu, and Sushi Eye. This place is great."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese type of restaurant.  I recommend this place for good Japanese comfort food @ a great price!"}
{"text":"We have been following Sushi Ken owners for more than 10 years since Sushi Ten, which the couple previous owned in Tucson.  Still great Japanese food prepared by Japanese chef.  Pricing is reasonable in most cases (Not sure why their Boat No. 3 is now $74 though) and arguably one of the best Japanese restaurants in Phoenix that serves good varieties of authentic Japanese food.  They still have some American food just in case you are a \"California-roll\" type of diner.  I love wasabi octopus and other \"hard to find\" Japanese food that probably only exist in this restaurant within 100 mile radius.  Their sashimi aren't the best as the cuts are very average.  I do notice that their sashimi quality starts to head south recently, so I will only vouch for other Japanese food here and not the sashimi.  Ps.  They serve all 3 major Japanese beer brands for those who cares."}
{"text":"Tried Sushi Ken for more than 10 times, I love their sushi(Rainbow roll,Dragon Roll) and Ramen! Great family restaurant,I have to say this is a slam dunk 5 stars.  Japanese owner run this business, absolutely authentic Japanese Sushi.Green-Tea Tempera ice cream is the best,make sure you order  that for your desert.    Tip: Always crowed Friday& Saturday night ,better to get your table is call them for a reservation."}
{"text":"This place always serves fresh and delicious sushi, and is my go to place for when I'm over in Ahwatukee. They have a great menu and options, and also have many kid friendly dishes. The one somewhat reoccurring item is the eh service. Waitstaff service is typically so-so at best. I find that I typically have to request water, several times to get a glass. Refills on any drink typically require prompting."}
{"text":"My go-to local sushi and udon and bento joint. If you live in the 'Tukee, and you like fresh sushi with good prices - Sushi Ken is your place. Service can be slow, but the staff its friendly and the value is solid."}
{"text":"Dependable, solid, AUTHENTIC Japanese food. The owners moved here from Sushi Ten in Tucson. The prices are extremely reasonable and portions are huge. Salmon kama (cheek) is buttery and fresh, makunouchi gives you a little bit of everything, they have lots of full meal combos starting from 6.50, and the umeshiso sushi is an acquired taste, but something different to try.   This is the only place in the valley that I can highly recommend for everyday Japanese food."}
{"text":"Great no frills sushi place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and very traditional.  They have a very large menu of all sorts of sushi and all sorts of other Japanese dishes, including LOADS of noodle dishes.  The sushi selection is awesome and the menus have pictures of everything.  The price is very reasonable. Why did it get 3 stars?  The service.  I've had to wait a VERY long time to be seated and the wait staff doesn't come around a lot.  The sushi cooks are kinda rude and didn't talk to us at all.  But if you can get past the horrible service this place is worth a visit for the food.  The price is good too."}
{"text":"I used to come to Sushi Ken a lot because the rolls were huge, the price was fair, and the fish quality was excellent, but the menu recently changed and now I think there are better options around. The rolls are still fairly priced, but they've become smaller. Previously, they had chunky rolls that were available for $5 - those same rolls are still available for $10 but the fish quality seems to have taken a hit. The fish we received was doused in pure sriracha and the taste of the fish couldn't come through. Their regular menu entrees (gyudon, ramen, etc.) don't appear to be changed all too much and are still tasty."}
{"text":"Sushi? Check Good Sushi? Check Lots of Sushi? Check Cheap Sushi? Check  That sums it up.  Great cheap sushi, friendly service.  My work regularly goes here for our sushi fix.  I also drive down with my fiance from downtown when we are in the mood for it.    #2 is the way to go.  Miso soup, Salad or Soybeans, 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll, 4 pieces of nigiri (salmon, tuna, shrimp, yellowtail).  -  $8.50  I'll also get the cucumber and eel roll because its oh so tasty.  This isn't the fanciest sushi bar, but definitely the best place to get your cheap sushi fix.  My only recommendation is to go for lunch.  Otherwise you will pay a lot more for the same portion at dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Sushi Ken for a while. The food here is good, however the reason for my low review is the service we received. When we arrived, the dinner rush hadn't begun. We ordered an appetizer, and we each ordered a meal. They brought out the hot dinner food first. When we were almost done, the appetizer finally arrived and so did the two orders of sashimi that were the dinner order of two members, so we had to wait for them to finish their food before ordering dessert. When the last two people finished their meals, we waited five to ten minutes before we decided to go up and ask to order dessert, which is when our waiter decided to come to the table and ask us if we wanted anything else for dessert. When we were finished with our food, we went up to ask for the check. When we finally received the check, they already added on a gratuity of 20% for a party of five. When we went to ask them about this, they said they only put an 18% tip and started arguing about it. The slower food service usually happens, and we usually go up to ask them for dessert and the check because the waiters stop coming to check on us, but after this debacle with the added gratuity,  I will personally never go to this restaurant again, and I would not recommend it especially if you go with your families."}
{"text":"Excellent place for japanese style noodles!  Finally, a place in AZ with a good selection of japanese dishes.  I've tried several of their Ramen, Udon, and Soba soups and they are all very good.  The best I've had in AZ.  I am also a fan of their japansese style curry rice."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour. The sushi was good. I had the unagi don burri with fried rice and a sashimi plate. Service was a bit slow and I had to wait 20 minutes to order."}
{"text":"It has been more than 1 year I have not been in Sushi Ken, but I still remember the taste of salmon Kama. It was like my home. This place is amazing. Owners are nice and so hardworking. I will be back one day and will say hajimemashite :)  PS. People who give one or two stars to this place please get california roll from safeway and continue to think that japanese cuisine is only california roll"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place!! I'm very picky about my Japanese food due to the fact that I'm half Japanese. I love their mini spicy chirashi because it's only $12.95 and it big enough to share with my husband. When I first saw it I was skeptical and thought that the bowl was just full of rice with a little bit of fish on top. NOPE it's the other way around! Full of fish with a little bit of rice on the bottom. We've had a couple of rolls as well and they have also been delicious. Next time I will be trying their ramen!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the sushi is fresh, and the udon is hot. Also, I've always found the service friendly though when they get busy it slows down a bit to accommodate the influx. For people who like a sushi restaurant that's polished and modern, may not be for you. For those of us who don't care about the trend factor and dig the Japanese diner feel, well, more yummy food for us!"}
{"text":"I had a strong craving for ramen noodle soup so I came to my favorite authentic Japanese restaurant!! Just in time before they close at 10pm. Always great to see and be greeted by the owners who are so delightful. The tonkatsu ramen pork based broth noodle soup with 3 large slices of pork, half boiled egg, sprouts, and greens was so flavorful and comforting to me. Comes with salad or edamame and California roll- all for $8.75.   They have new drinks called so-chu for $5 with different flavors such as strawberry and mango for those that enjoy those kind of drinks."}
{"text":"Great food but okay service.  The food is awesome here. It is owned and operated by a Japanese couple. Their sushi and ramen are authentic and taste great. However, waitresses are not very friendly sometimes.. but its not too bad since the food is so good and priced decent.  My wife and I go here to eat Sushi and ramen at least once every other week now."}
{"text":"What a great place for sushi in Arizona! I'm told they are under new ownership because it tastes a lot different AND better than the last time I came. I had a sushi dinner and the fish was fresh and buttery. My wife had tempura udon and it was fried just right with a tasty us In broth. My kids had the kids meals (chicken katsu & chicken teriyaki) and they mowed through it. They were even more delighted to get a huge scoop of ice cream at the end (my third child wished she didn't order an adult meal). The servers were great. We were feeling adventurous, so we ordered something I can't remember the name of, but it was a delicious piece of roasted hamachi head. Loved it. You can't go wrong for sushi at this place in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Awesome taste, great sushi, slow service due to business."}
{"text":"If you are looking for service, this is definitely NOT the place to go. It definitely misses the concept of what a restaurant ought to be. The attitude and ambiance of what it means to sit in and dine at a restaurant is far below standard. We arrived at the restaurant with several empty tables. Seating took another 15 minutes. Once seated, we weren't served our drinks until after the tables that arrived after ours got theirs and neither was our order taken until after theirs even though I had notified our waiter that we were ready to order. I do not care if he is the owner's son but to hold such a pretentious attitude at a family owned restaurant is rather un-classy. I've withheld judgement the two previous times that I have visited the restaurant always giving the benefit of the doubt that they were just understaffed or there were too many customers. But, as a diner, I feel that there is just a certain number of bad quality treatment that a customer can take. Needless to say, we walked out after paying for our drinks. Needless to say, I won't be back. I much rather pay a premium and eat at Roka Akor or ShinBay than sit through mediocre sushi and poor service."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place I was really looking forward to trying it.  I did - and I won't be back.  First impressions weren't great - it's rather dingy and dirty plus the restrooms really needed a cleaning.  It even smells funny.  I tried the vegetable tempura and was quite underwhelmed - no flavor and the provided dipping sauce wasn't great.  I tried a side salad - didn't like their take on dressing.  Then, a few of the more 'conservative' rolls.  I can't say they were horrible but I also can't say they were good.  I even ordered a side of chicken fried rice and found it not good, either.    I'm guessing that for people who are really into authentic Japanese food or raw sushi this place hits the mark.  However, if you are like me and more of a causal sushi eater then I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Looks like a family owned place and unassuming. Frequented by a lot of asians - so I figured it had to be good.  Tried the place 3 times, close to my house and I REALLY wanted to like it.  Tried it  with 3 different groups - co-workers, family and friends.  None are willing to comeback.  Service - not too rude, till you have to deal with the son.  Too much attitude, eyeliner and absolutely no customer service.  Although I did get much better service when came in with an asian male. Is this the typical japanese attitude toward women? Food was still mediocre to yucky.  Quality of food -- not very fresh and very cheap ingredients. The fish was obviously refrigerated for too long.    Too much msg.  The nori rolls are a rip-off.  Even after pointing out to the staff that only half of the roll contained the crab, they chose not to do anything to remedy the situation.  Seriously? How the hell do they keep customers?  Ambiance  --  not much, seemed family friendly till we came back with the family.  The waitress was unaccomodating with miserable attitude toward the kids.   The kids hated the place and were not impressed with the food.   And they both love sushi.   Overall, suprised that so many asians frequent them or that they are still in business.  Shocked by the glowing reviews."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Wow who knew a redneck could use chopsticks"}
{"text":"Came here again they added 20% grat since we did 3 separate checks with only 5 people. Or order wasn't even big and checks were hand written so it's not like there was extra work."}
{"text":"Having moved recently to Ahwatukee from NM and before that Hawaii I have had some great Japanese food in the islands and in Santa Fe it wasn't so bad but Sushi Ken is the best Japanese food and sushi I've ever had!!! The food is so fresh, the taste is light not greasy, incredibly amazing. It shows that they are always full no matter the time of the evening. The cost is very reasonable and unlike some other reviewers I am not bothered by the decor at all, There are many beautiful restaurants that in my opinion serve just very average quality food. I do care for the quality of food not so much the decor especially in Oriental restaurants.  Yes, there might be a wait if you arrive at the rush hours but it's so worth it. My family's favorites are the soft shell crab tempura, the croquettes, any noodle or rice dish, the sushi are memorable and I usually don't care that much for sushi anywhere else, the ones at Ken's melt in your mouth. The service is always very busy and I am just so thankful that they can serve me that fantastic food. They are worth a trip even from far away. I've called a Japanese friend of mine to come try them when she will be next visiting us. This is a 10 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I'm obsessed with the menu options, wish I lived in Arizona but we just stopped passing through. Fish was very fresh. The teriyaki chicken was nothing special but not at all bad. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The place was busy and I went around 9 on a Tuesday. However, they have lots of seating to accommodate all of their many fans. You will not regret visiting Sushi Ken."}
{"text":"On Wednesday, September 7, 2016, I walked in to place an order to go. I had a $5 certificate and I was going to order more food but that failed. I received the gift certificate from my parents which they paid money for. Apparently, there is a new owner and they would not honor the gift certificate. I was like OK but what about the expiration date. The certificate does not say anything about voided with new ownership. In my eyes, the name is the same and why should I care if you are under a new ownership. The life lesson is not to buy the restaurant gift certificates. In end, they did not work out anything with me even at such a low denomination.  I will not come back to Sushi Ken anymore. Your food was not that great before and when I walked in today, it was not busy. Please refer to the picture below."}
{"text":"As good as ever, even better.  The best chirashi dish for the money in the country, if not the whole world!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time to sushi ken AFTER the change in management a year ago. I've been avoiding this place after hearing so many negative reviews and experiences. I thought I would give it a try thinking a great place couldn't be bad just because a change in management and I was dead wrong. Over priced food, bad quality and bad service. The previous owners set a new place called sushi sen in South Scottsdale and ill be willing to drive there to get the sushi I once loved. I will not be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"This place use to be my absolute favorite. I don't know what happened. Food is good, but a lot more pricey and the flatware was chipped. However we did leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My rating scale:  (Only food and drink quality considered for rating. Usually worldwide comparison rating given unless otherwise noted in description)  1 Star - Terrible. The worst representation. Would not return.  2 Star - Bad. Below average representation. Would not return.  3 Star - Average. Decent showing. May return.  4 Star - Very good. Above average. Would return.  5 Star - Excellent. The best representation. Would definitely return.   Sushi rice overly warm while consistency loose and chunky. Salmon and tuna flavor not bad although overly warm and cut thick, effecting consistency and flavor.   Eel, white fish and squid nearly rancid. Miso soup, salad and draft Asahi also below average expectation.   Kind chef and waitstaff."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for about 5 years. The food WAS great. However, I came with my family today and this place is nothing compare to what it use to be.   I have not seen the original sushi chef a older gentleman for the past few times I was here. We usually order sashimi and ramen. The sashimi's quality is very not stable. Sometimes, the fish was cut to thin slices, other times it is kind frozen, but is not too hard. The freshness has gone done as well.    Today, I order the bento box with yellowtail sashimi, yellow tail roll and tempura. My yellowtail sashimi's color is a little off and most importantly it came FROZEN, so it is very hard, like ice cubes. I talked to one of the waitress and she took my bento tray and went to the sushi chef. A few mins later, the SAME yellowtail sashimi came back and was cut into THIN slices, but it's still very icey. It taste like fish ice slices.  Also, they were not even busy, there are 3 tables included ours.   I was too hungry and don't want my tempura get soggy.  I ate the tempura and the yellowtail roll. The sashimi still kind frozen, so I was not able to eat it. I don't know if it's against health code to bring back to the kitchen pieces of fish that the customer had ate and cut it to thin slices and bring it back.   I told another waitress about this when she brought the check. She offered me half off MY MEAL ($6). The reason for that was I did not eat the sashimi. I feel offend by this. I don't need $6 off. The way they bring back my thin slices of frozen fish was very unprofessional and shows lack of respect to customers.  The way they handle this, it's not acceptable.  I talked to 2 waitress about this and no management was ever involved.  I start to wonder was there even a manager at this place.   Lastly, this place is going down if nothing is going to change.  My family and I will never come back."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a group of 12 for 7pm. We came here on time and some people got seated early. It's now 8:35 and we haven't gotten our food and no one has been around to update us or refill water. We put in our orders at 7:35 because that's the first time the waitress came around. When we called someone over to take our order he had to tell another waiter because he couldn't take orders. At 8:35 the waitress came back around to tell us that they just started to make our rolls so we'd get them soon. Then we got our first refill of water.  Now, at 8:38 we have finally gotten 2 people's orders of sushi.   Once they get started its pretty quick but don't expect fast service, if any."}
{"text":"I love it here. I've been coming here forever. The food is always great, the workers are very nice and we never gave to wait very long for food! They could use some renovation tho, but otherwise they are amazing!"}
{"text":"just had dinner there earlier, 4 adults and one 16 months old baby.  the bill came out around 80 dollars, and they charged me almost $15 for tips.  I asked why, the server told me because we were party of 5 and we made a reservation. I worked as a server before and I never heard any restaurant charge customer's tip because of making reservation for party of 5."}
{"text":"Love the Korean Chirashi! Fun place."}
{"text":"Sashimi is as outstanding as I remembered. The ramen and appetizer combo for $12 is a steal and leaves plenty for my lunch box. Got the junmai saki at the happy hour with a plate of gyoza. Nice and quiet on Wed dinner time. Love love the sushi chefs who always do an amazing job slicing those beautiful fishes!"}
{"text":"The menu has real authentic Japanese selections. It reminds me of my trips to Japan.  My favorites are the Ramen and Sashimi. The price is reasonable and the service is great...Everyone should try it and I bet you would come back again..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for real traditional Japanese food. Sushi Ken is in the Ahwatukee neighborhood, I was so so surprised to found this place, I just hope people lived in this area know what is traditional Japanese food and appreciate it.  The owner is Japanese, all the sushi chef and servers are all Japanese at this place. The best pork stock Ramen and pork katsu curry dish here."}
{"text":"Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.    My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.    We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didn't break $30, which surprised me.  5 stars for value and great sushi!  Domo Arigato!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, although slightly slower than hoped for. We ordered Unagi, salmon sashimi, a roll, and a bowl of pork ramen. All of it was good, but anticipate service to be a little slow. It seems things get lost in communication or the process takes a while. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar if you want faster service."}
{"text":"Inexpensive sushi. I've only ordered it for pick-up. But the restaurant itself is quite bare, too bright. Sushi I've had and reordered: the baked Dynomite, the Mexican, Las Vegas, Alaska, and the Rainbow Roll."}
{"text":"Love this place. Sushi is wonderful but if you go make sure to try the soba or raumen. Came here on my birthday and ordered the boat with the sashimi side... sushi till you burst!"}
{"text":"My home away from home...ok a few blocks away. This staff knows me really well. Eat here often. Did I mention I love sushi? Very Japanese no frills menu. Not Americanized or very flashy. Just fantastic sushi. IT GETS BUSY! Don't blame the staff if the line is around the door. Please..."}
{"text":"After reading all the raves on Yelp and knowing the restaurant's run by Japanese, my hubby and I decided to eat here with our friends tonight, and boy am I disappointed and have to agree with people who gave low ratings for the restaurant! :(  First off, when we went into the restaurant, the place didn't look really nice. Quite plain and dark indeed. Then I could only see waitresses and chefs who are NOT Japanese, and I was kind of wondering if I had gone to the wrong place. Ok, when we sat down, two people came to serve us and we finally see one Japanese woman, then I felt a bit relieved that I got to the right place.  I ordered a korokke curry coz I missed the taste of korokke so much, not a lot of Japanese restaurants here have this on the menu, so I was quite looking forward to it :)  BUT! When I tried the miso soup, my expectations started to fade...it's really salty! It felt like a lot of tap water mixing some powder...(Plus the hot tea was salty too! Should be made with tap water instead of drinking water...The waitress also gave us wrong orders of salad/edamame too, but that's not a big deal...)  Then my korokke curry finally came, and I could see the curry sauce was as thin as juice flowing on my plate (my friend ordering katsu curry also had the same kind of thin sauce)...The sauce was not sweet curry nor spicy curry, but plain curry.  The korokke was not my favorite either, the crust was partly burnt in black, too hard and too thick, unlike the golden thin crispy but not oily crust I expected. The potato inside was tasteless. :(  The rice wasn't that bad and I did completed my plate but I'm really not crazy about it. My hubby also said his Katsu Don wasn't very good.   The only thing that's good was we sat in a nice little quiet corner of the restaurant and had a good time chatting for a few hours without interruption. Anyways, I think we'll try some other Japanese restaurants next time. :)"}
{"text":"All around great Japanese food. Employees extremely nice. Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"YUM!  I was there last month with a large group of friends (they don't do separate checks), and was really pleased with the food and service.  I LOVE sushi, but was worried about what I could eat while being pregnant.  I was so happy to see they had a large menu of sushi that included cooked meat (other than the boring tuna and California rolls).  I had a spicy lobster roll-SO GOOD- and vegetable tempura.  They do have a very large selection of non sushi items, such as tempura, udon, yaki soba, tonkatsu dishes etc.  There is something for everyone.  Oh- some of the freshest tasting wasabi I've had since my first sushi experience in san fran."}
{"text":"They have a very large menu. Everything from soup to sushi. Everything we have tried there has been made with absolute top quality ingredients.  Presentation is good to very good depending on how busy they are. But no matter what it looks like it always tastes perfect.    We have been there a number of times more now. And I still say the same thing, really good food."}
{"text":"Best thing to happen to Phoenix in a long time.  One of the few places I know that serve Japanese food that doesn't just consist of Sushi or teriyaki chicken bowls.  You must eat:  Katsu curry Ramen Gyu don Niku Soba Tenzaru Soba  I wish they still had hamachi kama :(  If you haven't eaten here and say you enjoy Japanese food, then I would begin to question whether you even like it at all to begin with (or you just tell your friends you do just so you can come off as cultured and \"with it\").  And if you HAVE eaten here and aren't digging it *coughteriyakichickenwtfcough*, there's a splendid Neo Tokyo up the road that may be more suited to your \"tastes\" (or lack thereof)."}
{"text":"Meh. Strip mall location, decent service, mediocre fare like most restaurants in the Phoenix area. I've had better. Much better. In Colorado, no less."}
{"text":"An all-time favorite of ours!  My in-laws drive from Peoria to eat here weekly because they are crazy.  They did change owners in the last year and portion and quality dipped a bit but has recently redeemed itself again.  Portion and taste similar to before but price higher.  The price of their combos keeps going up over the years but the value is still justified with noodle combos.   For around $15 you get BOTH a bowl of ramen or udon and an entree.  We always choose the tonkotsu ramen with the spicy chirashi.  Ramen is nothing special but does the job.  The spicy chirashi is their name for the Korean dish \"hwe dup bap\" which is small chunks of mixed sashimi (usually tuna, salmon, white fish, yellowtail) in salad, subtly sweet egg cubes, and rice all mixed together with sesame oil and spicy sweet sauce.  This dish alone is $12-15 at other restaurants without the ramen.  The sauce has recently been a lot spicier than usual so beware and add less.   Another favorite of mine is their hamachi Kama combo.  It's like a bento box with a giant perfectly grilled hamachi Kama, a tootsie roll, white or fried rice, edamame or salad, miso soup, shrimp and veg tempura, 3 slices of tuna sashimi, and orange slices.   The service is not the best but the great food outweighs that."}
{"text":"I like the sushi here but........ it's too damn expensive. The staff is kinda fake and money hungry. That's what it seems like."}
{"text":"We went here because google search said it was ranked #4 for best Ramen in Phoenix. Wow is all I can say, we ordered Sushi, since the place has Sushi in its name \" Sushi Ken\" the rolls we got were all mushy and look horrendous. We ordered two bowls of Ramen: Pork and Won Ton, the waitress only brought us the Won Ton one, thank god for that because honestly a 10 cent ramen packet from the grocery store is much better.  The waitress did take the sushi rolls off our bill but had another waitress come over and say that's how they're suppose to look.  I've had sushi and rolls in many major cities and never ever had mushy, runny, nasty looking stuff like this and I'm not gonna get sick here!"}
{"text":"There is a huge menu for this restaurant.  Only tried sushi and noodle soup combo dinner so far.  Lots of options on noodle soup dishes.  Each noodle soup has a different soup base.  The combo dish adds another small side dish option.  Lots of food for your money.  Sushi is decent and reasonable price.  Great Japanese family-style restaurant."}
{"text":"From 25 years of experience frequenting Japanese restaurants... this is the best, most authentic place in Phoenix.  And, if you don't want to take my word for it, then take the entire Phoenix Japanese population.  They ALL eat here!  If its just the food you care about, this is the place.  If you are seeking a warm, inviting atmosphere with great service then this is clearly not the spot.  One last thing... while my review of Sushi Ken's food is terrific, Sushi Ken himself is unfriendly, never smiles, has less than zero personality, ignores children (while making sushi at the bar), and flat out does NOT like to be asked questions nor be spoken to.  Weird!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Okay, sometimes the service is a little slow,....of course it's busy for a reason. The food is fantastic, fresh, presentation is outstanding, the people are friendly and the prices are incredible.  There's also a reason it's packed with people of Asian descent. True, the decor isn't Beverly Hills, but if you're more concerned with quality and value over atmosphere, this is a \"must visit\" locally owned, family friendly, neighborhood place."}
{"text":"My mom & friend raved about this place: great food reasonable prices. Yes, the prices were decent, but the food a bit lacking. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken & Tempura lunch plate. Tempura was hot, but not crispy. Teriyaki chicken had an odd taste-chicken was thinly battered, why I have no idea & the sauce was very thin and bland. The sashimi was fresh tasting but the knife skills of the sushi chef could have been better-it looked like my 7 year old niece had hacked at it. Service is decent. Place had an odd smell to it, I think it was from the carpet. Sorry, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but the service is always very bad.  Everytime we come here we have to wait for long time, and the attitude of the waitress always very bad, hope they can hire and train them more professional"}
{"text":"One of the best Authentic Sushi retaurants in town. Don't settle for commercial places like Ra. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"Best Japanese in east valley! Love their soft-shell crab rolls, their Tempura, the specials....their kids' meals are huge too!"}
{"text":"I came here with my coworkers for lunch couple times and i was satisfied both times.  One of my coworkers actually recommended this place for serving Korean style chirashi bowl.  It did not disappoint. Very generous portion (more than enough for two to share. We ordered chirashi bowl/udon lunch combo) with a TON, I mean A TON of assorted sashimi in that bowl! Wow so much fresh fish, every bite was heaven. The server wasn't too friendly but the service was fast which is pretty much the most important thing during lunch hour."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. The tonkotsu ramen was a bit on the salty side but the gyu don rice was good as usual. The waitress didn't seem to know about their sushi dishes and didn't seem to care to find out."}
{"text":"We visited Sushi Ken for lunch today, and it was excellent. The prices are extremely reasonable, and the food is delicious. We had the spicy mini chirashi and a spicy tuna roll for lunch and finished it off with a melon cream soda. They included a nice little salad (or edamame-- your choice) and miso soup with lunch. I will be back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed by the service and quality of the food at this establishment. The servers were too busy having conversations on their phones that we had to yell to get their attention to ask for the check. Some of the fish in our food were dry. Don't recommend this restaurant unless you enjoy being treated poorly and eating overpriced food."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical when we first pulled up but don't judge a book by its cover. We ordered so much stuff that they had to roll us out. The spicy tuna, salmon roll & spicy meso ramen was the best. The complimentary California roll was good too. I normally ONLY eat eel from Sakanas and it will stay that way. Here,  it lacked texture & flavor. The saki was awesome. We got out of there spending $75. It was a good experience. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person who likes to drive a lot, but I'll make an exception if the destination is this place. They have so many choices here like sushi, ramen and curry. I can't complain with anything I've ever ordered here. To satisfy my ramen and sushi cravings my go to order is the Noodle Combo they offer which comes with your choice of salad or edamame. I normally get the tonkotsu ramen and mini chirashi with this combo. The tonkotsu ramen is in a creamy broth full of pork flavor and the chirashi comes with salmon, yellow tail, tuna, octupus, tamago and even a piece of mirugai which is geoduck! I would give them 5 stars, but sometimes their service can be lacking."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at this place since it opened and let me tell you this place has gone down hill. Japanese people tend to be the nicest people but the women waitresses at this place have got to be some of the rudest I have ever encountered. They barely acknowledge you and when you ask for something it arrives 15 min later. The tall waitress is by far the worst, and it feels like she is doing everyone a favor by just doing her job. It's too bad the service is so bad as that really kills the experience regardless of how good the food could be. If I were the owner I would read these reviews and fire those b*t**y women."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Ahwatukee and the surrounding area. This is definitely the most traditional sushi restaurant I've found in Phoenix. The sushi is all delicious and of great quality. Their ramen and udon bowls are also very good. The service has always been friendly as well."}
{"text":"No. Just no. This wasn't the worst sushi experience I've ever had, but it was (very) far from the best. Nothing about Sushi Ken made me want to return. When I stepped in on Friday it was busy, so it definitely fueled my anticipation. But, after my meal I was wondering why all these people didn't just head down the street to (this other sushi place I know).  The service meant well -- a little slow, but friendly enough. The atmosphere was kind of cool -- kind of that well-worn Asian restaurant vibe I remember from San Francisco. Only this place doesn't really serve up \"the goods.\" The sushi was lacking. Some of it was alright. But some was just...\"no.\" Namely the Spicy Tuna; it was this bland, texture-less pink paste that I assume was made out of tuna, but you couldn't really prove it.  Anyway, I was bummed because I really wanted to like Sushi Ken; I heard such great things about it, and it's really close to my neighborhood. But walking away, all I could think was, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"I come to sushi Ken for their chirachi bowl. This last time it looks like they have cut portion size on the sashimi down noticeably. It's set up like a cafe and is always busy. They have hundreds of different things you can get."}
{"text":"Rolls are very large, cold, and fresh tasting.  Miso soup may be the best I've ever had.  Service was polite and fast.  Holds it's own with some of the good places in SoCal.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love the food at sushi ken and prices are reasonable, but the service is why I'm only giving them 3 stars. I come here all the time, unfortunately the service seems to get worse every time. They seem to be consistently under staff, or maybe they are just unorganized. Fridays and Saturdays are usually pretty busy, so you'd think they'd make sure they are staffed appropriately. They also don't adhere to their hours of operation so make sure you call ahead, mainly on weeknights."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is a hit or miss. I've been here on several occasions in the past couple of years and I've ordered great food, good food, mediocre food, and bad food. The service has varied from decent to bad, and yes,  if you ask to split the check they automatically add a couple extra bucks to your bill without telling you. A little deceiving, if you ask me, but the reason I keep going back is because their prices are great and (some of) thier food is pretty good for a Japanese restaurant in Arizona. In my opinion, it's worth trying out if you don't walk in with high expectations for food and service."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushi Ken for years. It's embarrassing that I've waited this long to write about it. Their sushi is fresh and delicious. I'm a fan of the $5 roll specials (look on the white board behind the sushi chefs) - these rotate but you can usually count on some sort of tuna roll and a few surprises. The tempura is always excellent - light and crisp just how it should be!   A few tips for Sushi Ken newbies... -The food comes out as it is ready. That means you may get sushi, then edamame, then soup, then some more sushi, then a bowl of ramen. Just embrace it and call them \"courses\". -If there is something that you don't want in a sushi roll, just mention it to the server or write it on the sushi order page. They are wonderfully accommodating. -It gets busy on weekend evenings, so come a bit early if you don't want to wait. -Don't be that guy who is waiting for a table and hovering over the poor folks sitting at the corner spot of the sushi bar. Go outside - the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Every one has \"their\" sushi spot. This was was my friends and not mine.   I didn't find the value to be great with the combo box I got. The items were decent nothing special. And the lack of service and flexibility to chance anything on the combo was upsetting.   The one place they do seem to shine is in new and novel rolls."}
{"text":"Seems like people either love this place or hate it. Yes it's a hole in the wall, yes the interior is bland and outdated, yes you might have to wait a while, but the sushi is great. So while it seems others say the food is hit-or-miss, I've yet to have a bad experience in the 8 or so years I've been going here.  If you want an Americanized, sleek, trendy atmosphere, this place isn't for you. If you're unsure of what you want beyond trying something new, try rolls off their $5 menu, those are all great. If you want a tasty, non-chain, local sushi joint, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is owned by a Japanese family.  They have great sushi and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The BEST Japanese food in AZ! Guaranteed! When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it! The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!! Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"This place is okay, the service sucks but the food is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars Service is 2. Slow to take order slow to refill water.  Price is 5. Very authentic food!"}
{"text":"Alright place for expensive sushi. Rather go to teharu for almost same quality and also a lot cheaper! I wouldn't recommend for a sushi place! They have alright service nothing to come back to"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review.... yet again.  I've come back to this place, since it's like 2 min from my house  The sushi fish was better.  Average.  Edible.  Good for a quick fix.  Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've come here, and since then I feel like the quality of service has dropped. Nevertheless, it's one of the few places in Ahwatukee to get decent sushi. My first visit actually was a less-than-stellar experience. I ordered a softshell crab roll and a spicy salmon roll, and the cucumbers they used in the rolls were extremely bitter! Totally threw off the taste of the roll! (Although that was probably a fluke because the next time I came the cucumbers were fine) All my other friends ordered ramen or udon lunch sets, and theirs seemed fine so no complaints there.  But then I learned from a friend in the know that what you actually need to do if you want sushi is to order their $5 special rolls. Way cheaper, and still a good selection! Personal favorites: Baked Alaska and White Tuna. At only $5 each, they are a filling and inexpensive option if you're feeling like sushi!"}
{"text":"Nice family style restaurant. I go there all the time for some ramen or eel bowl. I recommend the Miso Ramen. The broth is flavorful with plenty of vegetables and slices of pork. The sushi is no good though. I've shared the sashimi combo with my friends multiple times, and almost always have a bad experience. Last time the albacore tuna was soggy to to point of turning to paste."}
{"text":"I came to Sushi Ken on the recommendation of a friend of a friend who spoke highly of them.  First off when pulling up at night we couldn't even tell for sure they were open until we saw the small open sign lighting up as it was fairly dim inside.  Once inside we were seated and started going over the menus. As with many sushi places there is the cooked food menu with all kinds of combo options, the sushi menu and here they also had a sushi combo menu. The sushi combo menu is technically labeled \"lunch specials\" but sunday-Thursday it's all day.  I ordered a combo of a spicy tuna roll and a spicy yellowtail roll that included miso soup and your choice of edamame or salad for $10. I also ordered the white tuna tataki roll ($5). I went with salad and the waiter repeated that back to me and then 2 minutes later brought edamame and then kinda got a little taken aback when I said I had ordered the salad. He did take the edamame back and bring a salad quickly though. My girlfriend got the cali roll and a dynamite cali.  The sushi was pretty tasty although I think the spicy tuna and yellowtail were a bit undersized. I did like the yellowtail was big chunks of yellowtail, which I am guessing is what their chunky spicy tuna is like. The spicy tuna was fine but lacked any spice. The cali dynamite was ok but they used too much mayo on it, i did like the variety of different seafood on top but some of the fish chunks were over cooked. The standout was the white tuna tataki which was a pretty solid sized roll and was very tasty. If I come back it's probably to order 2 of these.  One other weird thing of note here was that the water tasted a bit chemically to both my girlfriend and I. It was like some residual cleaner was still in the glass as it had a chemical citrus taste.  I will say their prices are pretty reasonable for the most part although some combos seemed high. I can't argue that I got 3 rolls, miso, and a salad for $15.  On the strength of the tataki roll and the fact the fish quality seemed fine they get 3 stars from me falling right in my range of: I wouldn't be against stopping if I am nearby but unlikely to make it a destination. So if you are in the area it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"There are very very very few places I am actually willing to travel long hours to visit to eat there. Sushi Ken is definetely one of them. I love and hate this place. Love it because it is by far the best sushi place I have been, all things considered. Hate it because after it, all other sushi places I ahve been seem subpar. Ridiciliously good and fresh sushi and ridiciliously low prices. Now that I am in LA I have paid 2-3 times the money is some of the \"best\" sushi places here to eat worse sushi.  To everyone that wrote negative reviews about the noodles/service e.t.c. Guys you come to this place for only one reason: GREAT SUSHI. Please go for your noodles, teriyaki etc somepleace else. Agree with the reviewer before me, it is a same this place has not 5 stars in yelp, shows some people can never be satisfied with anything."}
{"text":"This is the place to come for good Japanese comfort food @ a great price!  It's their large selection of combos that gets me coming back.  It's mind blogging how many different combinations you can choose from (on & off the menu).  They have lunch special 7 days week (all day  Sunday - Thurs).  Most of the meals includes miso soup and salad or soybeans.  The kiddie meals are a great deal too.  The combo I got this time was off the menu:  Huge Hiramasa Kama (yellowtail collar) 4* with 3 pcs tuna sashimi, 3 pcs crunchy roll & tempura for $11 !!!!  You also can choose btw white & brown rice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g-I48SaHtdIGR5ZEoVeNFw?select=OMUg7pNZ7tN97MdUtjwgag  Their sushi & sashimi is nothing special, typical AZ sushi.  Cooked Food - 4*  Sushi - 3* Service - 3* Ambiance - 3*"}
{"text":"Ugh can't get the wet dog smell out of my head. Really?  Have to nuke a piece of nearly paper thin chicken to reheat?  And thinking about it the miso was watery as was the thin, strangely colored teriyaki sauce!   $32 lunch ... What a waste!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite and I come when I'm around this area, which is often. today we had to send back some yellowtail and the white tuna nigiri was lacking that fresh taste.    It's hit or miss here....but certainly good for a quick lunch.   My favorite is the chunky spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"During the lunch hour I purchased an 8 piece Spicy Chunky Salmon Roll to go, for my wife, who was in a rehab center in the neighborhood.  I guess raw fish is usually not served in a medical facility around here, maybe in Japan ;) The salmon tasted fresh and it was an attractive roll, $8 well spent as I wanted to increase her protein intake.  I tasted it and there was plenty of fish in small chunks, good wasabi and pickled ginger slices, rice, etc, an attractive package.  Kudos to the young man behind the counter working with an older man, probably his mentor.  The small staff was friendly and appeared efficient.  I will return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Great place.  When Japanese expats travel across the metro area to eat here, you know it's legit."}
{"text":"This is some pretty good sushi.  We frequent this as the primary sushi joint of choice when dining as a family.  The prices are pretty good and the food tastes great.  Service is pretty slow so don't expect a quick experience."}
{"text":"Our go to spot in Phoenix when it comes to sushi.   Sushi Ken is an absolute gem of a restaurant. The prices are ridiculously cheap, food is especially fresh, and their spicy chiraishi is wonderfully delicious.  Starting off with the rolls, my favorites are the Dynamite California Roll ...which melts in your mouth with every bite (full of scallops, salmon). I am a big fan of eel and the Rainbow Roll always satisfies my eel cravings. The Chunky Spicy Yellowtail and Chunky Spicy Tuna Rolls...they are what they say they are...chunky, meaty, and tasty.   What I love most about Sushi Ken is the Spicy Chiraishi. It is literally loaded with all types of sashimi and veggies...for a great price ($12)...I live in NYC and I still miss and crave Sushi Ken.   To all Arizonians, do yourself a favor and take advantage of Sushi Ken, my wife and I sure did during our stay there!"}
{"text":"came here when i  was on a business trip. i landed before lunch hour (~11AM) so by the time i got to the restaurant, it was super empty. i didnt trust phoenix sushi lol so i opted for chicken katsu curry. portions were huge!! you could also ask for brown rice for an extra charge. they have pretty good lunch specials/combos!  coming from LA (next to the ocean & bigger japanese population), a small japanese restaurant in phoenix didnt impress me nor my expectation too high lol."}
{"text":"Love Sushi Ken! It's the only place I keep going back to...and it's a hike for me from downtown Phoenix, but totally worth it. Great prices - between $3.50 - $5.50 for sushi - and the fish is double the amount of rice. Rolls run between $5 - $9.50 and they have a great selection.  Like others have mentioned, it's not a fancy place - fine by me! It's very authenticate. Sunday nights it's pretty slow so you get fabulous service - and they're always fast to deliver the food. Tried the sweet and spicy roll for the first time tonight and loved it! The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is b/c i've been there when it's busy and the servers can't keep up."}
{"text":"Wish I can give this place 10 stars ! Food is fantastic, great customer service & best of all the price r such a good deal , cheap price for lot of foods."}
{"text":"The sushi was perfect! Fresh, delicious and plenty of it.  $5 happy hour rolls were a nice surprise! Would highly recommend Ken's if your into good eats in an unpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fresh fish. Great portions. Ambiance is a bit odd: no music. It was dead silent. Luckily I went alone, otherwise I would've felt to intimidated to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Used to be fantastic. Tried it for the first time in months. Remodeled new menu. Service was not as good. Selection  seems more organized but smaller. Waited over five minutes for my shashimi while my friend got his entre. Definitely not the same. Fewer people too. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Really really good sushi. Poor service and often a wait but really really good sushi. Maybe avoid other food though. Stick with the sushi and miso."}
{"text":"The menu here reminds me a bit of Hanaya Yohei in Japan - I love these kinds of places!  It had an authentic family resu feel - and a # of Japanese natives frequent this restaurant.   The menu is awesome - Beautiful menu displaying every item in clear pictures - and an amazing selection - loads of everything: Tempura, Yakitori, Sushi, donburi, soups, shumai, cooked fish, etc!  They really should update the pictures on yelp just to show the menu.   The tempura and tempura sauce were excellent Yakitori was excellent Sushi was very good Shumai was good Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I brought my family here after I heard great things about this place....the reviews were dead wrong. The waitress took forever to take our order. We got to the restaurant at 7pm...we didn't get any water until 7:45pm. After requesting for water on three separate occasions, we still did not get them. We had to ask another waiter to get us some water. Our assigned waitress also forgot to put in our order at first and then managed to put in the wrong order. I usually don't leave negative reviews, but this place takes the cake for horrible service. Although, the service was lacking the food was decent. Maybe?"}
{"text":"Sushi  Ken is wonderful. I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. The most recent was when I brought my parents who were visiting from out of town and they loved it! Sushi and sashimi are always fresh and their combo deals are great. I think they have great ramen and have also heard good things about their chirashi bowls (Korean or Japanese style )."}
{"text":"This place was horrible honestly. The sushi was very much so sub par. The fish was not fresh. Also, the wonton soup tasted like regular top ramen. The wontons inside had horrible meat inside them. Would never come back. I never write reviews but feel like I had to with this place. If you're considering going to this place...don't."}
{"text":"WOW~!! Is there anyway to give this place negative rating?! I blame myself not to read previous review. The tall, non japanese server didn't disappoint me and if you are like me, want to try extreme bad service, try this one. It was a small incident, they give my plate to the table next to me, so I had this long wait for my food. After they finally realize it, they just simply swap the plate to me?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! I asked them to bring a new one because I don't know if it's already eaten or wad, but the tall woman refused?! WTF! really?! Is this really happening? I can't believe it. I ask to talk to store manager, she said she is the manager, so I asked to see owner but she refused. I feel it's really waste time to argue with us so I decide not to ask anymore because I will not come back again. I should properly cool down a little and get her name so if somebody read this review, they at least know who to avoid and not to ruin their mood. But I recommend is NOT TO GO THIS PLACE AT ALL!"}
{"text":"While the sushi and ramen here are pretty good, I must say that their Teriyaki Chicken is a rather regretful order.  I'm not sure how the chicken is cooked... steamed? boiled?  microwaved??  it is really REALLY tough (and tough to eat).  Perhaps a little healthier than it would be if it was cooked in a pan, but extremely untasty. The sauce is also a bit too heavy for the meal.  Definitely go to try their other dishes, just be warned about the chicken!"}
{"text":"I was really jazzed about coming here because of all the great reviews but was really disappointed.  didn't seem that great and honestly it was a little dirty feeling in there.  :( the food was ok but again I think it's a little over rated by yelpers...sorry guys!  I tried the ramen since that was highly recommended but again it just fell short, I've had way better ramen. wah wah"}
{"text":"I generally don't venture out of my ten mile radius rule.  But for sushi ken, I am happy to get into the car and venture out to Chandler.  I've already been familiar with this restaurant since it was in Tucson.  Nothing much has changed.  Friendly (leisurely) service, solid mom and pop Japanese food.  Good prices, good amount of food.  Some of my favorites are the ramen, the korroke curry, and oyako donburi.  Nothing fancy, just delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken, apparently they're known for their Udon noodles.  Why not Udon Ken?  Came here with my friends after a brief hike. I was one hungry boy! I totally dig their lunch hour prices, but since my friend told me about their noodles I went for it instead of the sushi & sashimi.   Presentation was delightful, but overall the Soba Noodles I ordered were decent at best. It wasn't really anything special from what remembered. Everyone else at the table had mixed reviews, but it's mines that count! Haha! I plan to give Sushi Ken another try since I didn't get their famous Udon Noodles. Until then stay tuned.  We were watching my boy Jeremy Lin rock, but only people with good sight could see what was happening.  Yes, they need a larger screen!  I don't think a 32in screen does the restaurant and their patrons justice; just a thought. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night and finally remembered why I didn't come back here for more than 5 years.  Sushi ken's menu is so extensive. They serve almost anything Japanese. I had chance to try variety of food in the past including ramen, sushi, tempura, donburi, curry, grilled fish to name a few.  They are not bad, I am sure one can find similar quality restaurant in Japan. For me they all tasted like cafeteria type food. Cafeteria food serves its purpose and they are there to please diverse people.  It's just such a drive for me to visit, unless I am already in the area, I don't think I would make an effort to drive there just to eat their food. Thus being said, if you are in the area, and with picky person or not sure what to eat, this place is a good option to visit."}
{"text":"A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often."}
{"text":"Huge menu with a large selection of lunch specials!  Sushi was very good and actually had quite a few more pieces than your typical roll.    Service is friendly and quick!    Rolls we had: Sweet and spicy-I could taste the sweet, but couldn't find the spicy. Mexican roll-Could have used more jalapeno, but was very good Spicy Tuna-Can't go wrong with this one! Yellowtail-Way too much fish!"}
{"text":"Not going back, the sever was very nice. Apparently the owner whom everyone loved sold and this place has gone down hill fast. We sent back our sushi as it was mushy, sloppy piles of rolls that I wouldn't feed my dog. Our Saki had a strange taste and our ramen was mediocre to say the least. We barely ate and I have been feeling nauseous all afternoon. We have been told the owner opened Sushi Sen in Scottsdale which we will take the ride and try. Don't waste a perfectly good afternoon or evening eating here."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars, but service was prompt and attentive so I'll round it up to 4.  Rolls were huge and cheaper than other places. Fish was fresh, spicy tuna was soooo good. I've been twice and there was something \"off\" to me, the second time I realized it was the sushi rice. Its bland tasting to me.  I want to go back to try the curry dishes."}
{"text":"Here is my favorite sushi restaurant. The food is always fresh and tasty. I strongly recommend \"Sushi Ken\" if you want to eat perfect sushi. :)"}
{"text":"Has to be my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley. They are so nice and always greet me and say good bye when I leave. The fact that it's actually run by Japanese is great too! Being Japanese I am really picky about he sushi that I eat so this place meets my high standards. Everyone should try this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ok, let me just start by saying, I've been to Tokyo, lived in Honolulu and I think this is one of the better, more authentic Japanese restaurants in the valley.  If I lived/worked closer I would be at Sushi Ken weekly.  In the summer, nothing compares to their cold ramen.  It is so hard to find decent ramen in Phoenix!  For lunch, you don't get more bang for your buck then their bento and lunch specials."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is one of the better Japanese restaurants in the Phoenix area. The quality of the food is consistent, the prices relatively reasonable, and the service is efficient.   They serve a variety of lunch specials that are in the $10 range. However, there are so many options to choose from the whiteboards surrounding the restaurant, that I would recommend checking out those options. I've been to Sushi Ken have ordered the Love Boat (~$65) when I'm with a big party of people. When I'm by myself, I like to order the chunky yellowtail roll ($5) or the appetizer and noodle combo (~$15). I recently tried the mini chirachi bowl, spicy miso udon, hamachi sashimi, and soft shell crab roll. All of them were fresh and delicious. The side salad that they serve with their combinations is pretty lackluster. I would recommend getting the miso soup or edeame instead.  The place gets busy during dinner time, so I would recommend making a reservation if you're coming in with a large party. Otherwise, the tables move relatively fast and I would not be discouraged by the wait."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken easily has the best ramen in the Valley. Wildly generous portions served with a side of sushi, and it all comes for a very fair price."}
{"text":"Back at Sushi Ken for dinner last night. First time I've been there since they redecorated/ or possibly got new owners, but I was really impressed. The food tasted amazing as always, and the service was faster than usual. The way they changed the layout of the restaurant makes it seem bigger and also gives the customers a little bit more privacy. We got the tempura entree and the spicy miso ramen, both were amazing and fresh! Very impressed with the noodle texture and depth of flavor in the broth, though it was a tad bit salty. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Ken on a Saturday night with two other girls.  One of them claims the ramen noodles are so so good.  The Charsui ramen noodle was the one of the best.  So of course we had to get it!  The entree came with sushi and green beans.  I ordered gyoza and ice green tea.  The gyoza was ok.  The iced green tea was the real thing.  It was so good.  Then came the Charsui ramen.  The ramen was very good.  The charsui was not bad.  The soup base is soy sauce so it was a little salty for me."}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix, AZ on a business trip w/ my boss.  We just had to have the GYU DON(beef bowl).  We went on May 30th for lunch but, was closed to construction.  Had to eat the GYU DON before our return on May 31st.  After a fun day of golf, before our trip back to Phoenix airport, we stopped by and has the GYU DON and COLD UDON combination set.  AWESOME!  This satisfied our palate.  Now we were able to return back to LAX."}
{"text":"The ownership changed, but we kept going. Last time, one of servers was so friendly and nice. He was great, but tonight was very disappointing. This was very obvious favoritism or racism, I should say, experience that I ever felt. We( Asian woman and Black guy)walked in, and they welcomed and seated us. Then a white man walked in and they welcomed and seated him. They didn't even ask what kind of drinks we wanted, but one of the servers asked  the white man who came later. And a couple of minutes later, a white woman walked in. And seconds later a waitress took the drinks to the table for the white man and to another table for a white woman. Finally she came to us and ask  what we wanted to drink. Really? We closed our menus and we were sitting obviously that we were ready to order. They didn't even acknowledge us at all! So I told my boyfriend, \"Let's go\"  I had to let them know why we were leaving.  So I  asked for a manager. Of course he or she wasn't there. So I told one of servers that we were here first and you guys were serving them who came later after us. All she said was \"sorry\" trying to give me a hug. If you were trying to hug me because I am your sister, you should have served us fairly.  It really made me sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food and cheap prices. Such great quality. One of the only and best authentic japanese restaurants in az."}
{"text":"For affordable, no-frills sushi, we always choose Sushi Ken. My husband works for a Japanese company and when the Japanese come to town, that's where they go for lunch; they say it's the most authentic for them. Now I know all you Hipster Foodies on this site (especially those who have expense accounts and don't mind paying $100 a person for \"Trendy Sushi\") will look down on the lack of ambience and menus with photos (\"the horror\"; so kitsch!) but I'm saying the Shashimi Combo (lunch or dinner) hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible. Waiters keep forgetting our orders. Kitchen was really slow took about 40minutes to get a spicy shio ramen....Another 30min to get all other food out. Once food came orders were not accurate. Hopefully they can train their waiters and kitchen staff to improve on effeciency. I can see they're slowly losing their customer."}
{"text":"The sashimi bento is the best sushi/sashimi selection in Arizona. There are other sushi restaurants, but they have converted to the American needs and not the classical Japanese eats. This changes the flavor and the need to beautify the sashimi plates, other places like Sakana or Ginban speed up due to people not wanting to wait. A good fresh meal takes time, just like home cooking. Nobody ever asked there mother to speed up, if they did they are rude."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic! We had the teriyaki chicken dinner with, scallop sashimi, tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi- the fish was fresh and the portion was big! Also the spicy yellowtail is amazing!  And they are quick to see if you need anything else to drink or sides without seeming too buggy."}
{"text":"Seriously what happened Sushi Ken!?  Went in for lunch and got the Noodle Combination: Tsukemen and Dynamite Don. First off the Tsukemen tasted pretty awful, like dipping in tasteless soy sauce (that was just plain salty). Secondly, the noodles and sauce were both ICE cold...I didn't order cold soba noodles...  The Dynamite Don looked like it always did but this time, there was VERY little rice on the bottom. It tasted more like I was drinking mayo sauce with some seafood...  Not really coming back anymore, it would seem that Sushi Ken has been going down as of late. Will have to get my lunch fix elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"we ordered the Special Sashimi platter, Dynamite, a order of sea urchin (Uni), baked scallop roll, fried calamari and the house crab cakes!!  I have to say that everything was very fresh and very good. we have been to many sushi places in Cali and we were not expecting to find this quality here in AZ. they even had fresh Wasabi, not the powder Wasabi it was really good!!  Good thing that we just went there without reading the past reviews, or I may have not gone here and have missed out on great food.  thank you Chris (our waiter) for the great experience we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here yesterday. My husband likes to come here for the chirashi and now i remember why i do not like to join him.  I eat sashimi at least 4 x a week. I know sashimi, i am not new to this. The salmon i received was so pungent it left a lingering taste in my mouth. My husband who would eat anything agreed, it was fishy and unlike the salmon in his chirashi. It was a cheap cut of the tail and it was not treated properly.  I do not mess around with fishy fish. I sent it back. The waitress argued. She did not apologize, did not ask if I wanted to order something else. I had lost my appetite anyways. As i sat and watched my husband and daughter eat I could see the servers huddled in the corner.   She only returned to tell me \" I tried your food it tasted fine!\" and walked away again with a huff.  I dont know why Im surprised by such rudeness and audacity. As if I wanted to send back my food and first meal of the day? We had been running errands all morning. I was famished! The accusatory tone and stares were so appalling.  No wonder this place is empty. Aside  from the gaudy decor, stained carpet and filfthy restroom, now i know why they tint the windows, so no one can see how gross it is inside.   Thank god i sent my food back. I would have surely paid for it later with sickness.  Thank you previous yelpers about the tip about the credit card fraud. We made sure to pay and tip in cash. Shouldnt have bothered though. but karma...so I did. (tip)"}
{"text":"Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs when we arrived.  After driving around looking for a place to do dinner, we finally found Sushi Ken.  We marked our orders immediately and this is what the $80 bill for 3 people came out to:   -Edamame and miso soup -Vegetable and shrimp tempura -Chicken katsu curry to share -And a whole 'lotta rolls, some of which included: salmon skin, baked scallop, spicy tuna, smoked salmon, Alaska.  The rolls were huge, with 8 or 9 pieces each. We ended up with plenty of leftovers for a second meal later that night."}
{"text":"WARNING: CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT! They are con artists!  A friend and I had lunch here. A few days later we discovered that they had added $2.00 each ($4.00 total) on top of what we tipped. My friend called the restaurant and they claimed that it was because we had paid with two credit cards (split). Not only is this charge ridiculous, but it would have been more appropriate to add it to the pre-tip amount or inform us about the charge when we put two cards down. Increasing the amount AFTER WE LEAVE is simply deceptive. From reading other reviews, it appears that we are not the only ones that have experienced this.  The food is mediocre and, as other reviewers state, the service is poor. I will certainly not be back."}
{"text":"I live 20min away and there are many sushi places around my house, but my husband and I will only go to Ken. There food are all tasty and the price is very good. the sashimi appetizer is only $11.99 (I think) but come with many many different kind of fishes and very fresh. And their soft shell crab roll is the bomb. Will recommend to anyone and everyone..!!!!  Also 10starss for the service."}
{"text":"BEST sushi place ever! Tempura ice cream is a must! I love their green tea tempura ice cream. The combination No. 7 is SO delicious! Their sashimi is THICK cut and FRESH and they provide you with at least 5 kinds of fish for only $12! You can't find that deal ANYWHERE for THICK CUT AND FRESH SASHIMI. Their pork shumai, ohhh my god, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD.   Their ramen is super super good but the only thing about it is that its a bit salty. I kept eating the ramen and the salt in the broth just builds up on my taste buds so by the time I only have a couple of bites left, all I can taste is salt. Good experience but wouldn't order ramen again."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation, as this is a good spot for sushi.  Our party of 8 had no problems getting a table on a weekend.  We ordered many sushi rolls, ramen, and bento boxes.  The sushi rolls will fill you up so be sure not to order too much.    Overall the quality is less than what you'll find in any major city.  It's hard for me to compare this to other Phoenix sushi restaurants, but I've had much better sushi in CA, NY, Philly, and Denver.  We won't be coming back here.  =("}
{"text":"Still great place for my Japanese food cravings. The sushi has been hit and miss...sometimes I come and it's great but others not as fresh. Can't go wrong with rolls, though, and the other food items!"}
{"text":"Trying to find a Sushi place that is open for lunch on Saturday was tough but we did find Sushi Ken.   We were served complimentary miso soup and edamame.   Their sushi picture menu had a lot going on so it was hard to decide, we ended up getting an avocado roll, a vegetable roll, a crunchy roll and a tempura fried California roll.   I wasn't really paying attention to the sushi being made because I was busy eating my soup and edamame.   All our rolls looked good but sadly, not tasting all that great.  The seaweed was so chewy, the Crunchy Roll is advertised as using snow crab but it was obviously mixed with Krab as well, not to mention what tasted to me like a gallon of Miracle Whip, it was soooooo gross!!  The Avocado roll was the best one despite the chewy seaweed, the deep fried roll was just gross too, definitely made with a roll that was quite possibly rolled days ago and the vegetable roll was just OK,  it had a strange mix of veggies inside, I don't even know what they were.   Now another couple walk in and sit near us at the sushi bar and I was able to see the sushi being made since I was done eating.   Sure enough, I see the chef grab pre-made rolls from across the counter and top it with fish for a rainbow roll. GROSS!   There is no reason why these rolls could not be made fresh to order.   Now on to an even bigger surprise, you know how they usually grab a piece of seaweed and a hand full or rice and begin to work it onto the seaweed........  I saw the chef grab a piece of seaweed and take it down behind counter for literally 1/4 of a second and come back up with it covered with the pressed rice WTF!!!   Their rice and seaweed it also pre-made not wonder it was so damn chewy!   I would rather wait and wait for freshly made sushi any day than be served soggy chewy old  pre-made Crap!   Seriously I'll never go here again!!"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! The server literally yelled at us when we tried to talk to them about letting our food sit at the sushi bar for 15+ mins and taking 30 mins to bring us check. Not to mention how terrible their dishes were! A simple, quick dinner turned out to be 2 hour waiting hopelessly. He NEVER apologized. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"the food was amazing, we ordered four different rolls and loved them all, especially the Baked Alaska Roll. The service was kinda slow, but the place was packed and there were only two servers so that was expected. However, unlike what other reviews said, they were not rude at all. A tip to get seated faster: look at what's open. If you request to be seated at the bar but the bar is full, you're going to wait a while. We ordered twice and got out in under an hour, so I think it wasn't bad for how packed they were (and on a Wednesday night!). Besides, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!! Fresh fish. Great presentation. Great quality and value for your buck."}
{"text":"I've been to many, many sushi places, and this is the best one. Great service and perfectly fresh sashimi. I love it and we go often. It's a family run place, and they take great pride in their work. It really is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss but the food is amazing. You know its a good sign when half the restaurant is filled with Japanese people."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with my girfriend under their new management. Ordered soft shell crab roll, spicy tuna roll, beef short ribs, and chirashi dinner. The quality is somehow changed, taste is good but when the menu said soft shell crab roll comes in 8 pieces then I expect 8 not 5, told waiter and he went back checking on menu then came back and said 'Yes, it said 8 but it's 5'. Chirashi dinner is also lack of quality, I used to love to order it here a lot before since it was the best I've had in Phoenix but now they ruin it by taking ikura, ika, and unagi out of the bowl. Beef short ribs ($16.95) were over cooked covered in oil and very chewy. Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Ken! The staff are all so friendly and welcoming, and the food is delicious. It's always bustling at dinner time, but that's just proof of how good it is. I'd recommend the chicken curry (my favorite) and the rice bowls!"}
{"text":"Good Chirashi Bowl but waiters didn't care about giving us a to go box."}
{"text":"So far, the Sushi Ken is my top 3 Sushi Restaurant in Arizona. I believe that they are the most authentic Japanese Restaurant in Arizona. My Japanese friend also agreed that.   -Price and Quantity: You may have to spend least $15 for one meal, so it is little bit above average. However, the amount of food is larger than other Japanese restaurants. If you order combination, you have to order the dish you do not like and it is expensive, unless you share with other person.   -Dish 1 Review: Nigiri(sushi) -- Spent $4.50 -- 3.8/5.0 stars Nigiri sushi is thinker than any other sushi restaurants and it taste better. $4.50 salmon nigiri is not even expensive when you see the amount of the food. Dish 1 re-order? YES  -Dish 2 Review: Chirashi -- Spent $17.00 -- 4.0/5.0 stars *Chirashi: selection of sushi rice, brown rice, or spring mix and comes with your selection of 5 different types of sashimi or other ingredients)  It was my first time trying Japanese Chirashi. Other Japanese restaurants serve standard Chirashi but Sushi Ken provides a piece of paper for customer and you can make your OWN Chirashi. I ordered 5 different types of sashimi and sushi rice. Sushi Ken serves pretty tasty rice and amount of sashimi was way bigger than what I expected. I shared my dish with my friend.  Dish 2 re-order? YES  -Dish 3 Review: Tonkatsu ramen soup -- Spent $8.50 -- 4.0/5.0 stars  Special about Tonkatsu Ramen was soup taste. It is very delicious and you can ask for spicy powder to make spicier! Noodle is delicious but not amazing. It is average.  Dish 3 re-order? YES  -Suggestions to restaurant:  Menu is too complex. I like the food options but the menu is disorganize and had hard time to find dish I want. I went with my friends and they all agreed. Also, they write special menu on board, it is readable but disorganize.   -Comparison with other restaurant: Sushi Ken Vs. Shimogamo  I would go Sushi Ken, when I really want to eat lot sushi with limited budget. I am not really expecting special sushi taste from Sushi Ken. When I want good sushi, I would go here.  When I want something special, I will go Shimogamo. Their Salmon Nigiri has special flavor. But not I am not a huge fan of their rolls, very small and didn't like it.  -Overall Restaurant Rating: --Service: 2.5/5.0 stars -- One time they include tips even we were party of three. Also, they do not have standard serving skills and workflow.  --Menu: 3.8/5.0 stars -- They have many Japanese food that you can't try from other restaurant.  However, I did not try all menu, yet. So, I cannot give food review for that.  --Desirable to revisit? YES, I went there 3 more times after my first visit."}
{"text":"I am originally from Japan and this is one of a few Japanese restaurants I love in Phoenix mainly for the following 2 reasons.  1. I can find real authentic Japanese dishes (including sushi) with good quality in a wide variety. 2. All are reasonably priced.  When I say real sushi, I talk about the quality of fish, not about sushi rolls which I don't find in Japan. Well, a few simple sushi rolls like tekka maki (tuna rolls) but definitely not anything like california, spider, rainbow rolls etc. except at fast food style low end restaurants. In Japan I go to both low end ($20-30 per person) and high end ($200-300 or up) sushi restaurants.  Sushi Ken's sushi has quality of a decent sushi restaurant in Japan. It's a really good thing as it seems hard to get fresh fish in Phoenix. First time I had their sashimi lunch set, I was impressed by the quality of the fish. So my guess is they have at least one Japanese real sushi chef who knows fish. In Japan, chefs have licenses and specialized in certain areas (such as sushi, Japanese, ramen, etc.) and are trained for years. (like in the movie \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\")  As for the cost performance, I recommend their appetizer & noodle combo($12.5). It's really a good deal considering some of the appetizers are not really appetizer size. I had chirashi sushi (assorted sashimi on sushi rice) for appetizer twice and it's quite filling by itself, then it's followed by a big bowl of ramen. I couldn't finish all of my food. This combo menu was not in the menu but on the wall.  I noticed some people complained about the waitresses there. I so far haven't had any problems with their service. I've been there for 3 times. They were friendly and quick. I don't think it's because I'm Japanese as they were nice to others too. Maybe I just haven't met the notorious waitress yet.   I'm so excited about going back to Sushi Ken soon. And I recommend this place to all who love authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"WOW!  That's all I have to say.  Not sure what happened since the last time I was here, but it was like going to a completely different restaurant.  Horrible, rude service from BOTH of the waitresses, not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall, nasty, and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal.  And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is a family-run sushi place in Ahwatukee. They have an extensive menu, good prices, and the food is always great. It can be crowded, with a wait depending on when you arrive. If you're interested in something different, I recommend the \"Dynamite\" dish. It's very flavorful, but not too spicy."}
{"text":"the sushi here is amazing! the only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because their service sucks! Sometimes you'll  wait 45+ minutes for food. Servers will just walk past you when you want to ask them for something... other than the service the food is amazing. and in my opinion worth going."}
{"text":"I'm warning you already, I am very grumpy in this review. More than usual. I am a very lenient Yelper most of the time. This one isn't going to be a pretty one.  Oh man. I was really looking forward to this meal. Having to drive 30min for the highly-recommended Sushi Ken? It'd be worth it, right? I had even skipped lunch in the hopes to be famished and love every bite of the dinner even more than normal.  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( It was the worst Japanese food I've ever had.  I had the Beef Curry and Tonkatsu Ramen combination with a salad. The salad was colorless and wilted, and the dressing (I love Japanese dressing), was overly vinegar-tasting. The Beef Curry was ok, but I make better Japanese Curry at home using the curry cubes in the boxes sold at supermarkets.   The Tonkatsu Ramen....should not have been called such. The ramen tasted worst than instant ramen! It was mushy! There was no taste in the broth of marrow-y goodness. It was a salty, lifeless broth with shriveled bamboo shoots, too much wakame, and one measly thin slice of charsiu. I had about 4 bites and left the rest to die. I didn't even take it home to try to remedy it.  My husband had the Tempura Bowl and Shoyu Ramen combination with an Edamame side.The edamame was the grayest-green shade I'd ever seen. Frozen edamame from the supermarket looked better than that! His tempura bowl was bizarre...gone was the flaky, crunchy Panko breading. What was brought out was a glazy, weirdly crusted abomination that was overly sweet. I would like to dip my tempura myself, thank you very much. His Shoyu Ramen was terribly salty. My husband even likes things very salty, and he couldn't drink it. He also left 90% of his bowl untouched.   The only thing they didn't mess up was their California Roll, which is pretty impossible to mess up so thank goodness for that.   And the service? Terrible. Absolutely terrible. We were a table of 9, and they could have cared less. The 15% was already included in the bill, so maybe that's why they didn't even bother to try to be nice to us. The ladies were so mean! It looked like they just hated everyone they were serving! And usually Japanese waiters are SOOOOO nice. I know, cause I used to wait tables alongside co-workers who had just immigrated from Japan.  Funny thing is, the rest of the table really enjoyed their food. (Update: One of them messaged me after reading this review to tell me she actually didn't like the food...lol I guess my husband and I were not the only ones that didn't enjoy it) Nobody enjoyed the service though, I can assure you of that lol."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food is just OK. They also charge 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more."}
{"text":"It looks kind of sketchy from the outside, but what a great gem on the inside!  Sushi Ken, despite being in the middle of the desert, has the best sushi I've had in the Phoenix area so far. The fish, while not super fresh, is cut with finesse, which makes all the difference for sashimi and nigiri. And such hearty portions, how can you say no?  As for the curry tonkatsu, yum. The sauce was maybe a little watery, but the flavor was perfect, and the pork was perfectly breaded and stayed intact.  I could see the service being less attentive if it is busy, but given my experience, I would overlook it for the quality you get in the middle of a desert."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality sushi and sashimi, Sushi Ken is the place to go! What sets this place apart from other sushi restaurants is that this is a Japanese Sushi Restaurant that serves a multitude of different authentic Japanese dishes. Their serving sizes are very generous and their prices are great! Their hot ramen is better than a lot I've had in places like San Francisco and LA, and my favorite by far is their Oyako Donburi bowl, which is chicken breast, onions, shiitake mushrooms, green onions and eggs served over rice and sauce."}
{"text":"Dear Ken,  I love your restaurant because the cooked food is just as good as your reasonably priced sushi so that non sushi eaters (read-WIFE) still want to take me there for my raw fish fix.  But why, oh why is the service so slow and maddening?  Could it be you don't have enough servers to help your sweet, overworked staff?  And why won't you listen to me and open a branch closer to my house in South Chandler?    But I digress, love you like family, keep up the good work and see you Saturday."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is very expensive for what you get. I would not go there for dinner unless you are willing to pay a lot of money. I ordered a roll, and with tax, it was about $20+. I was kinda saddened about the sushi, how much it was, and how I was still hungry. The amount of sushi and the quality is, I believe not up to par for what you have to pay. For the price, I would definitely go somewhere else...possibly Sakana (cheaper and better service). The service here is decent. I did have to waive down the waitress a couple times to refill my glass of water. The atmosphere is alright as well. The restaurant is clean. I would only recommend this restaurant for lunch (when they have the lunch special)."}
{"text":"I am really surprised that it has taken me so long to eat here since it is just a mile or so from my house.  My wife and I tried it out last night and were really, really pleased.  We had tuna tataki, langostino roll, Philadelphia Roll (in honor of the Phillies advancing to the NLCS), spicy tuna roll some gyoza and miso.  Our intent was to have enough to bring home, and we certainly did.  The tuna tataki was the star of the show - I would recommend that anyone who has not been to Sushi Ken should give it a try just for the tataki.  It was excellent - and only $6.95 for a very generous portion.  I was stunned.  The langostino roll was spicy and delicious for and the Philadelphia roll was pretty standard - which is not a criticism, Philly rolls are what they are.  The spicy tuna roll was over the top with spicy tuna mounded on top of a normal spicy tuna roll.  Very impressive for the price and in comparison to other places.  This place is not fancy, but I dont care - I will be coming here to eat, and I will be coming often.  I am so happy that it is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I stopped going after i found out they are under new chef and new management now. The food taste old and it is important to serve fresh food for a Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great value - I ate my heart out and paid 35 dollars including tip. Same meal would probably be 50 bucks in Los Angeles.  This place is ran by Japanese people and I found their stuff is more authentic than most. I'm sick of places that has random ppl making sushi because they either: put too much rice in the nigiri..the rice is too sour or the fish cut is too thin/thick.  Fish tastes relatively fresh...not the best but def. not the worst. I'd give it a 8/10.  This still caters to the traditional Americans who want an assortment of rolls but for those that just want some good old nigiri - you can't beat this place. Place is relatively large so seating is pretty quick."}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant.  Traditional comfort foods anytime I want.  Read other reviews about the service and too bad they had that experience.  Walked in on Saturday night and got seated right away. When I want Japanese food, I will come here even when they're busy."}
{"text":"Consistently good. We found this joint by accident and been there a few times. Food is quite good and they have some items that are a bit hard to come by other places around for some reason - Like Soba Soup.  Service was pretty nice and food came out rather fast and as always tasted real good.   \"I like\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"They should rename this place \"Sushi When?\"  WHEN will you notice that we have been standIng there for 5 minutes, waiting for a simple hello or at least a nod that we exist?  WHEN will my party of two be seated at either of the two empty tables that sit vacant and lonely?  WHEN will your serving staff bring us water and utensils after looking at your menu for 10 minutes?  WHEN will you communicate with us?  Even just some eye contact will give a glimmer of hope that you want us to be there.  After a total of 20 minutes of sitting and waiting for basic service (we never received a menu, water or utensils nor a \"we'll be right there\") that is WHEN we stood up to walk out.  The staff was rude, unprofessional and clueless.  The sad part, we are regular customers.  Well, former customers.  Sorry Sushi Ken... Your quality of service has slipped while your disrespect for your customers continues to rise.  We will travel farther to enjoy quality Japanese food in a cleaner establishment with a friendlier staff who offer quality service."}
{"text":"Yes, this place deserves all the starts. Quality service, quality food and quality atmosphere. When I can walk into a restaurant, sit down and not have to wait long for my food, then I'm impressed.  The night I was there it was quite busy but everything ran like a well oiled machine. And it was friendly service to boot.  I know Japanese so I was talking to the sushi chefs about the restaurant, etc. As I was eating, they kept pulling out new Yellowtail, since they kept moving through orders. Amazingly fresh!!!  They have ALL the important Japanese standards: Ramen, Soba, Donburi as well as tons of fresh fish and amazing roll creations.  Wonderful example of a true Japanese-owned business. Great Job!!"}
{"text":"Food = 3 stars Value = 4 stars Service (really really slow) = 3 stars   Average = 3-4 stars  The food is decent for the price.  You get a lot for your buck.  The first time I came to this restaurant I got the combination Gyu Don and Hot Udon (food was okay, not amazing).  The next time we went to this restaurant I got Spicy Tuna Don and Spicy Ramen (The Tuna don was really good, ramen was okay).    Decent food (food that is hard to find in Phoenix), great Value!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends for dinner. The service was good, but the food I got was pretty bland and standard. I got the Lobster roll (can't remember how to pronounce it). the entire roll itself was dry, from the lobster to the rice. I didn't enjoy it much and it was over $11, not very worth it. I'd give the food one star, and the service 2 stars, as they were very good and attentive."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Especially for Ahwatukee.  They currently don't have a website which makes its very difficult to view a menu for to go food."}
{"text":"Prologue: My fiancee and I were looking for a new sushi experience for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date and a search on Yelp of sushi restaurants close to home yielded this restaurant along with some good reviews.   The Plot: It was apparent from our review of the menu, as well as the signage posted in the restaurant, that they offered a greater variety items compared to the other sushi restaurants we've already tried.  So, we decided to be adventurous and order several dishes to share, including Deep Fried Baby Octopus, Pork Tonkatsu, Dynamite, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Rainbow Roll, and Uni Nigiri.   The Scene: Most impressive for us was the presentation, particularly the extra effort that apparently had been given to plating the maki rolls. The Soft Shell Crab roll was actually a little creepy looking, which made it even more fun to eat.  All of the other dishes were good and on par with favorable dining experiences I've had in the past. The Baby Octopus was warm, crispy, and yummy, the Pork Tonkatsu was juicy, tender, and delectable, and the Dynamite was savory and satisfying.  The service was courteous, our orders were all promptly delivered to our table, and the meal, overall, was quite delightful.   The Rest of the Story: Everything was as good as expected and there were no disappointments. At the same time, there were no real stars in this meal. Considering the variety and the number of specialty items on their menu, another visit might reveal something more memorable.  My fiancee was a little surprised when the tab came to about $70; however, having had similar dining experiences in the past I was fully expecting to pay that much.   Epilogue: The quality of the food and the variety of items on the menu easily deserve 3 stars.  Never the less, this dining experience did not rank among the best $70 meals we've had and so we elected to not award a 4th star.   Photo Design: by Billie Z."}
{"text":"The place is under new management service is horrible. Server has no clue what we order."}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is the absolute best Japanese food in Arizona, possibly even top ten for the United States. The place is Japanese owned and run; unlike a lot of the other \"Japanese\" places in the area. The sushi I ordered was perfect, in every way, shape and form. The eel I had was nice and warm. I tried a bit of my girlfriend's chicken she got and it was delicious. Anyone who likes Japanese food simply must visit this place, is it also great for first timers. If you want to try out sushi but are afraid of raw fish just get the crunchy shrimp roll since there is no raw fish on it. There are plenty of other cooked dishes that are amazing. If you are a fan of raw fish they have a great selection as well."}
{"text":"A homey little Japanese restaurant with good amount of specials.  They may not have the freshest, most high quality sushi, but they have all the staples of good home cooked Japanese food. I really like their noodle special where you can pick a noodle dish along with a curry or katsu dish. It's a lot of food for only $12 or so. Good sushi selection of rolls but remember, you're in a land locked state...   Really enjoy coming here and always want to be back."}
{"text":"Thought I reviewed this place already.  Since it's been about a year and a half since I last ate here (twice visited, ate once), I plan to give SK another try very soon.  Thought I'd just get the ball rolling now...  I met with a few people here the first time, but wasn't feeling hungry enough, so I just joined in the conversations and just observed the food as they were delivered to the table.  Most of my companions that night didn't actually order sushi, and instead, opted for Chinese dishes or Japanese noodles and other hot dishes.  The low menu prices did pique my interest, so when hunger pangs struck me a couple of hours later, I asked relatives if they wanted to join me for sushi (and they did).  As noted in the number of stars I posted above, I was not impressed with the rolls/nigiri I tried that evening.  I found the sushi (vinegared rice) lacking in the flavor department, and the roll ingredients to be subpar.  The selections we shared between us were so bland, I can't even recall which rolls and nigiri we had ordered!    Since it's been almost two years, and a lot can change in two years (for good or bad), I will be back to give Sushi Ken another try."}
{"text":"Their combo dishes give you a good amount of food for a good price.  I got the tempura udon that came with 3 pc cali roll and a salad, while my boyfriend got a rice and ramen combo with edamame.  Definitely left full and didn't pay too much."}
{"text":"Hands down the best lunch ever. Chef kadzushi is simply amazing. I loved the service and the volcano yummmmm"}
{"text":"Well , ordered a dynamite dinner to go on 4/28/18 , and the Potion its extremely small , not so sure if I has to do with change of ownership."}
{"text":"Just came back from Sushi Ken. That would be our last time to go there. The service was horrible. I said again HORRIBLE. after they sat us down, We waited for 15 mins for water. When the food come, mine didn't come for a long time after they serve my friend's. Finally, the next table told the waitress they didn't order that dish. That was my dish. They took it to me. I wasn't very happy, but don't want to take it back. (who knows what they are going to do in the back) My friend was trying to stand up for me. He mentioned to the waitress we want a fresh dish. She said how FRESH you want. and look at us like we said something very ridiculous. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend.  I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since I've come to AZ, I've never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here.  The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know you're at an authentic place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this local spots, been coming year for years. The sushi chefs are helpful, staff is solid, I've always had good experiences here.  It's a chill spot here in Ahwatukee that is also a very good value."}
{"text":"This place would be a 5 star if everything on their menu was tasty and the place looked a bit less casual. The 4 stars is because ALMOST everything is tasty and the portions are huge! Their specials on the whiteboard is probably overlooked by many of the people walking in, but that is where you need to order from! You get the option of mixing and matching what you want! Do you like sashimi? Take a look at that Chirashi bowl pictures on here! Holy smokes! You know what, you can get that with a bowl of ramen too and your bill is still under $15! WHAT?!  The food and price here is spot on. This is not your super fancy, straight out of the ocean Japanese place, but wow the food is fresh, good, and reasonably priced. Well worth the drive to get here if you're not a sushi snob and just like good Japanese food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars but rounded up for fast & good service  Good sushi for a good price. Their rolls aren't anything too fancy but the fish is fresh. They give you a lot of pieces and the pieces itself are pretty big."}
{"text":"Love this place the staff is beyond nice and the sushi is fresh. They take the time to make it look like art and taste like heaven."}
{"text":"We have a two years old daughter and we have been taking her with us to many many restaurants in town cuz we enjoy eating out. We always bring her own food since she has special diet need. No restaurant ever told us anything about bring our baby's own food except this one.   We were told bring own food is not allowed even for baby, needless to say, we were upset and that would be our last time visiting there.  This restaurant is the most kid unfriendly restaurant."}
{"text":"High quality sushi at great prices!  The sushi always seems fresh, and they have great lunch specials.  We brought our Japanese friend here when she visited, and she was very impressed with the quality of the sushi.  I wish I could eat here 5 days a week."}
{"text":"Personally, I don't like sushi, but I falling love with sushi after the first visit to Sushi Ken. Just that simple."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is by far the best Sushi and Japanese joint in town!  This place is as authentic as you can get for Phoenix, AZ.  My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice, seaweed, and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish.  This incredible bowl of deliciousness is $20!  You couldn't find this much fresh raw fish at a restaurant for this price anywhere else in Phoenix.    If I get the Chirachi bowl idea stuck in my head, I have to have it and nothing else will satisfy my craving.  Speaking of...I think I'll order one for take out right now!  ;)  I rate Sushi Ken at the highest rating possible: 5 Noms: \"Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, & NOM!\" :D"}
{"text":"YEAH YEAH IT'S A GREAT PLACE BEST SUSHI IN ARIZONA. Well I guess if the cost of living is low you would settle for CRAP!!!! The only reason I give one star is that I'm hoping you read this before you enter the abyss of flavorless food, the out dated torn furniture, the lack of communication and the unpleasant smell of rotting carcasses of old fish.   I'm not picky, I don't look at yelps and judge, I  give the benefit of doubt that maybe one or two, even three bad yelps could just be normal.   $62.00 later I judged. My family and I went there and of course the first thing that hit us straight in the face is the odor. Odor it was, we were hungry my son wanted Rosatis I said tomorrow for lunch. It really should of been that night. I wanted to give a chance, we were seated and it seemed slow but we were early. The waitress took out order, we waited the soups came out fast and so did the eddis mommy (edamame). Our plates came out one by one as it does in most places of that cuisine. We waited for the waitress to come around but all we got was her back as she took care of the other tables, yes understaffed. Places like this use the phrase KISS Keep It Simple Stupid. That was the service and food. They will do what the order says and nothing more besides give you the check and take your money. I was very disappointed, the chicken teriyaki bento was something so unique with combination and the fake chicken breast they use, just as bad if not worse than a frozen lean cuisine, fried soft potato and a baked cup with some onion and chicken I have no idea WTF it was, but I was hungry. I had to try it thinking I would be surprised with some delightful tastebud exploding extravaganza in my mouth, only to have to eat 10 certs after and a shot of JACK to get rid of the bad tasting odor that followed from the room into my mouth. I really would at that point snorted some wasabi, not only for the flavor but also to keep my mind off of spending that kind of money for nothing. If you are in town drive further and eat at a chain sushi place, they lack the creativity of thinking out of the box but it will be consistent. This review is my opinion, take it or leave it."}
{"text":"OK.  I've read some of the reviews here and I see a lot of complaints about service.  Let me give you the real deal.    Why should you listen to me? I travel to Phoenix a lot for work. I eat a lot of sushi. Go ahead, think of another sushi place around.  OK, have you thought of one?  Well... I've probably eaten there and this place is better.  Why?  Sushi quality is top notch and prices are lower than they should be and slightly lower than the average sushi joint. Now, if you're thinking of a restaurant with a $100 piece of nigiri then no, I haven't been there and it may be better.  I go to normal priced sushi joints.  The only downside to this place is that they don't have fresh wasabi.  What's that?  Fresh wasabi?  Yes, many sushi places won't have it on the menu but will sell you some for a buck or so.  Go fresh.  I'm sorry to anyone who feels I just gave away a sushi secret., myself included.  Maybe I'll delete that part later.   Anyways, after eating here a good 15-20 times, I can confidently state that the service is fine.  Only one time did I have poor service.  The reason that you may have poor service is because this place gets packed and there's a line waiting to get seated and to eat.  The staff is then overworked.  Should they have more staff on hand?  I don't know. I'm not a restaurateur.  Bet you didn't know that word didn't have an 'N' in it  Me neither until now.  Point being, it is what it is.  You don't like it.  Don't eat here when it's packed.  They're also the kind of place that will close early when everyone has left.  You know what? I like that.  Sure it can be inconvenient for you, but they probably have a better quality of life because of it and we can all learn from that.   I only wish this place was closer to my home.  Like 2500 miles closer."}
{"text":"I've tried and retried and retried during lunch time to like Sushi Ken, but I truly do not understand the popularity of this place, maybe because it's the only non commercial sushi restaurant in Ahwatukee.... who knows. A big turnoff is just the atmosphere, the dirty carpet, the old paint and dirty ceiling, the strange smell, the tacky printed out food specials taped all over the place, maybe its me but it just feels dirty and when I go to dine on sushi, I want the place to feel clean. I started coming here and ordering Sashimi, it's an OK quality, then I started ordering the specials, awesome deal: an entree with an appetizer choice. I prefer the Spicy Ramen with the Mini Chirachi.   Last week I brought a friend here. He had sushi: the Spicy Tuna Roll, which he thought was OK, the Hamachi Sashimi, which he thought was big slices but no taste, and the salmon sushi which he asked if they could slice a couple slivers of jalapeno on, which he though was OK too. Everything done and we get the bill. Not to be a ball buster but I will be, they charged us $2.00 for the slivers of jalapeno on the salmon sushi. when asked about the extra charge the waitress said \"it's a $1.00 extra for each order for jalapeno and we had 2 orders (see photo attached). Really! When I said we live in the hot pepper state and I can buy a jalapeño for 25 cents, her explanation was we are a restaurant!   When you nickle and dime your customer you lose your customers and for the already on the fence dirtiness of the place, you lost me and any recommendations!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Great food, prices, and service.  Right after I sat down I ordered, and it was ready within 5 minutes.  I got a Shrimp Tempura and sushi combo. Sushi pieces were all different kinds and they were all delicious. Tempura was warm and crunchy. Also came with good Miso soup and white rice.  It was a quick experience but was exactly what I was looking for. :)"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place to go for sushi --- sat at the bar, good stuff kept coming.   The yellowtail was butter (and a huge piece) --- atmosphere was super --- nice without being fancy.   Best sushi that I have had so far in Phoenix.  It does get crowded on weekend"}
{"text":"Waitress didn't smile once or check in on us.  Forgot soy sauce bowls and waters more than once.  Food came out at different times.  Sushi haphazardly rolled and falling apart. Rice to sashimi ratio wasn't good.  No water refills.  I found a hair in my food.  One of the worst dining experiences I've had. I actually started drafting this review over a year ago and I'm finishing it now. Guess what -- I still remember how bad of an experience we had."}
{"text":"Pretty good sashimi.  Menu is huge!  A little over whelming if you don't know what you want.    I recommend the sashimi combo.  Comes with rice, miso soup and edamame.    Spicy yellowtail, Las Vegas and Rainbow roll were also very good."}
{"text":"They include the tips in the final price on the receipt, but did not even tell the customers about that. So it is highly possible that most people double tipped them. However, their service is not good at all."}
{"text":"It was so refreshing to go into a sushi restaurant run by Japanese people.  The atmosphere isn't very nice, the walls are a little too white, the lights too bright.   The sushi more than made up for it.   It was awesome and affordable.   I really enjoyed the meal and service was good.   I would highly recommend for good sushi."}
{"text":"I base this post on the past and present. I went here two days ago and I was slightly dissapointed only because they raised the price since the last time I've been here which was probably half a year ago. The combination ramen + an entree used to be 11.50 but is now 12.50. Yes its only a dollar but that wasnt all. The specialty rolls that they have for 5$ is the same price however the size of it was cut in half from what I remember. It still gets a 4 stars because although they did raise the price and cut some portions, they are still relatively cheaper than most sushi restaurants. There quality is good but not the best and they offer a variety with there combo plate which is a slamming deal still. When i go with my friends we each get a combo (tongetsu ramen with spicey tuna donburi is my favorite) and a few orders off their sushi rolls off their 5$ special to share which is super filling. Service is always great here also."}
{"text":"Sushi ken I love you so much, I don't even know where to start! It's about time I write a review. This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley.   Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A. Like California rolls B. like spicy whatever rolls C. Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you, please just don't come and spare me your stupid review, just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that. My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks, I feel like the staff is our family. They are very nice and polite. A lot of families here, restaurant is decorated simply.  Nigeri and sashimi are very good. UNI here is amazing! Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad. From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl. I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Ken.  Good food, nice staff.  I have been eating there for years!  So, why a 1 star rating?  Because they won't spend enough money on the actual place.  The bathrooms are simply disgusting.  The walkway to the bathrooms show you the back door to the kitchen which will instantly take your appetite away.   In 2016 they had a shake up in management that resulted in a new floor to replace the moldy carpet they used to have. Us regulars smiled and prayed for more. Next they ripped down some of the hand written menu items. Then they put up $3 IKEA paper lanterns. Cool. Then they stopped! The tables are worn out. The bathrooms (did I mention that) are worse than the ones at a bus station.   PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Sushi Ken Management: if you are reading this get an interior designer and spend $20k to remodel the bathrooms.  You will see the results with more customer visits."}
{"text":"Good prices for the amount of food you get.  But the quality is lacking.  Wasn't a big fan of anything we got from sushi, sashimi, ramen, to agedashi tofu.  I would rather pay more for better quality."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi/ramen place when we're in the area. Dynamite California roll is almost always a 5$ special and that's like a meal in itself and delicious.   I love the spicy miso ramen. Meat is so tender juicy and flavorful. Noodles are good, broth is good, can have a little more flavor though. This time the broth had good spicy flavor but not much other flavor. Good portions, ramen is more than enough to fill me.   The spicy allstar roll and eel and avocado rolls are also pretty good.   Good value for good food. Although go early or late. Kind of a small place so when it's busy the wait can be quite a while."}
{"text":"My pork katsu curry was delicious and so were my rolls and nigiri! My food looked and smelled fresh and beautiful. The staff was friendly. The bar and dining room is clean and unpretentious. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Some of the freshest sushi I've had. Love their spicy miso ramen and spicy tuna Donburi combo so affordable, delicious, and a ton of food! The only issue is it gets really packed and sometimes you will have to wait for a table and service may be a little slower at prime times. The wait is definitely worth it. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have been a customer for many years, never got disappointed by the food. Sometime, the place is very busy and the ladies are doing their best to keep things moving, but otherwise, it is an excellent quality, non pretentious and friendly place for sushi and sashimi lovers, and reasonably priced for the size of portions,"}
{"text":"From the outside, you would never know how great this place is! Wonderful sushi at great prices - lots of different rolls to choose from. Gave me hope that there may be hope for sushi in the valley after living in the SF bay area surrounded by many wonderful sushi bars. It's always a good sign if there are lots of japanese people eating at a sushi place - this is the case at Sushi Ken. The only thing I wish is that sushi places in the valley would not put spicy mayo or cream cheese in every \"creative\" role on their menu. The crazy roll is very good. The lunch specials are a great value and always prepared fresh. The kid's box meal is tasty - my daughter loves it - lots of choices."}
{"text":"best japanese food in the valley.  it's nice to actually see japanese people eating there (myself included).  it's more home-style japanese cooking than the over-done, over-concocted, over-americanized usual fare you will get at most japanese restaurants around here.  you can get yakisoba, saba shioyaki, croquettes, sanma, oyako donburi, and a lot of other dishes that you won't find in most of the americanized japanese restaurants.    it's not really a sushi place (despite the name).  the sushi is okay, but not great...i've not been to yasu sushi bistro so can't do a comparison.  but it's fine.  we eat here mostly for the other dishes, which remind me of my three years in japan.  that being said, i will agree with others that decor is minimal and the service is sometimes a bit slow.  but the food is usually good...and that's what matters to me.  it's also a great deal for the family."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This is one of the very few reviews where the restaurant can do so poorly in one area but make up for it in another and still maintain 4 stars.    I'll start with the negative.  On busy weekend nights, service here can be abysmal.  Far too few servers to cover the entire place.  You will wait for everything, from water, to ordering, to getting your food all at the same time.  If you go in expecting this, it's not as bad, but sometimes it really can feel frustrating.  But, on the other hand, there is the value and the quality of the food.  If you order off of one of the white boards at the north end of the restaurant, there's a noodle combination and special combination.  If you order either one of these, the noodle combination in particular, you are getting one of the very best values for Japanese food in town, and anywhere.  You can easily split the combination between two people, or be totally stuff on your own.    The food here runs from average to quite good.  They are no longer my go-to ramen joint, but the ramen here is totally passable, made up for mostly by the broth.  I typically opt for the miso  or spicy miso ramen - I believe this is the best broth option.  The udon is also average, but on a cold night, is satisfying.  I've enjoyed quite a few of their appetizers, which they treat with the minimalist care that one should expect from a Japanese restaurant.  The korroke are lightly breaded with a satisfying crunch.  There is a tako (octopus) salad that is slightly vinegary and delicious.    Their sushi also runs from average to good.  If you go for straight nigiri, don't expect coastal quality.  It is akin to fast casual sushi in Japan, which means good for a quick meal but not mind-blowing.  They actually excel in rolls here, and one of the best is the chunky spicy yellowtail.  Decent kick of spice that doesn't totally mask the yellowtail, and plenty of fish.  For another decent deal - get the chirashi bowl.  There is a mini-chirashi and a create-your-own chirashi.  Both are great values and since you're getting a bowl of sashimi, you're getting some better quality cuts than if you were to order straight nigiri.  So plan for the wait, set aside some time, and accept the service issues, for they are worth it in the end."}
{"text":"This place just opened. I must say a hidden treasure indeed amongst all the strip malls across Chandler.  My friend took me here last weekend and I must say, this place impressed me. Being a sushi snob from LA, the portions were quite large and in charge and the sushi was fresh.   Their Albacore was delicious. Melted in my mouth with the ginger and ponzu sauce. They also have some killer lunch specials and the staff have exotic eyes (one with blue eyes and one with a lazy). The tempura was also good- not oily at all and very fresh. Try their bento box lunches. Lots of food- most of it under $9 with edamame and miso.  Decor is gross but honestly come here for the sushi. It's really good for the price! (lunch for 4 was only $35!)"}
{"text":"I've been there 3-4 times and have found the food to be excellent on each visit. Lady owner is warm & welcoming... Lunch there today was quite good and reasonably priced. .. Place is a bit worn but food & service are excellent... I will go back for future visits."}
{"text":"I could only imagine how bad the service in a restaurant could be, until I visited Sushi Ken with my family on 8/12/2012 for lunch.   The waitresses who served our table, (I really wish I knew her name, she is the taller one, with *less* Japanese accent),  she had provided the worst service I have ever seen, it was as if she did everything in the purpose of offending customers.  (1) Our party has 6 adult and 3 kids occupying 3 tables putting together, when she came over to take order, I was sitting at the other side of tables and I told her \"I am ready to order\", she said \"That's what I am here for.\" and just stood still there, I had to raise my voice to finish ordering for everyone.  I mean, I was the one who's talking and couldn't she just move a few steps toward me ?  (2) We ordered some sushi rolls and 5 complete meals, she told us we will get 5 appetizers and asked if we want salad or Edamame, we said 3 salad's and 2 Edamame's, and they were served as ordered, no problem here.  Later on she brought over 4 bowls of miso soup.  I think it is quite normal for anyone to expect 5, right ?  So I asked her \"Shouldn't it be five?\"  Guess what?  SHE ASKED ME: \"WHY?\"    Oh my god, she asked me back \"WHY\" and then we went totally silence after that.  It took me about 10 seconds to guess and said \"is it because one of our meals only comes with appetizer, but not soup ?\",  then she said \"uh -ah\" and walked away.  Are you serious ??  (3) After we had our fried rice and curry beef plates delivered, we looked around on our tables for spoon and not finding any, I waved her over and said that we need spoons for eating THIS fried rice and THAT curry rice.  I even pointed at these two plates because I was already afraid of mis-communication.  Then she brought over \"one\" spoon!!  1, o-n-e, single, uno !!  I told her again that we needed two, she stared at me as if I should have told her exactly how many I wanted.  Hello? I told you we need it FOR THE FRIED RICE AND THE CURRY RICE !!  IT IS YOUR PROBLEM serving plates that need spoons to work on, and not bring spoons with them, not my problem.  (4) After that moment I think her attitude turned from \"not friendly\" to \"rude\", when she brought over my noodle, SHE THREW THE BOWL WITH NOODLE SOUP TO MY HANDS, can you believe that !?  She delivered the noodle to my hands, not my table !!  What if I did not catch it ??  She definitely had gone over my edge at that time, if I were not with my parents and kids, I would have exploded right away, it was my family that prevented a confrontation from happening right there.   (5) The food is plain, actually after all of the above happening, I didn't care about the foods anymore even they were 5-star quality.    After the kids were fed, I waved her a couple times for check and I don't know if she overlooked me deliberately or she really didn't see me, after about 5 minutes I walked over to the cashier's stand and asked her \"Can we have the check, please?\".  YES I SWEAR TO GOD THAT I STILL USED THE WORD 'PLEASE' TO HER.     She did not bother to raise her head or even speak up, she just keep doing what she is doing, and nod her head.   At that time I immediately told myself two things:  (1) I am not stepping into this restaurant ever again in my life, and  (2) I will do whatever it takes to let the store manager know what happened today, or let the store owner (if she happens to be the manager).  Having this kind of employee is definitely hurting the business !  *** To that waitress *** . If you do not like providing service, then don't do this job.  I am not expecting you to show any passion, if this is just a source-of-income for you; But you need to have some basic manner and  respect if you put 18% gratuity on my bill.  If I wasn't forced to pay that, you were not getting ANY tip from me, because you do not deserve it."}
{"text":"Much better than average strip mall Japanese food.  Whenever I eat at a strip mall, I gird myself for potential unpleasantness.  None to be seen here.  Sushi Ken is a bright, cheery place with good service and great food.    They are creative with rolls - they managed to have a few that I had never tried before (Crazy Roll is a version of a shrimp tempura roll, Crunchy roll is a California roll with tobiko and unagi sauce on top).   More than that, they have some excellent entrees.  The saba was big and delicious.  The konkorre (deep fried mashed potato with meet and onions) was, well, deep fried but good.  The tonkatsu was excellent, and the food in general outperformed my expectations.  Our friends in the area use this place as their go-to Japanese restaurant, and now I can see why.  Tasty and friendly.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I haven't had this in a while so I can't really give a ton of detail but I have been here a few times. It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places. The thing I remember about this place that I really liked were the lunch bento boxes. They had a ton of food and miso soup and all that and they were a great deal, I don't know how much they were but it was very cheap for what you get. The service is only average but for a cheap lunch with more traditional sushi I would definitely hit this place up."}
{"text":"You really can't expect 5 star sushi in an area like Arizona but Sushi Ken is able to please my sushi needs even in the desert. Their ramen bowls are good but are nothing compared to eating from the streets of Japan. The spicy tuna rolls are edible but aren't the best or worst I've had. I was able to sample from one of Sushi Ken's sushi boats and am pleased with the amount they give for the premium price. 3/5 stars because the quality of the fish was not the best."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars for the best Chirashi I have ever eaten. A simple raw fish and rice became this extraordinary meal. Every thing about this dish was amazing.  The fish was generously sliced and fresh, a light sprinkle of seaweed on rice, topped with salmon roe and another type of fish egg. My waiter was polite and nice. I would drive out of my way to come eat here again. I hope this dish doesn't ever change. Delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Best Japanese food ive had in a while! Good for its price too! However, don't go when there's a lot of people because you will never get any attention from the waiters and the wait time will be forever."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the food was delicious! We tried the yami roll, caterpillar roll, and tempura udon - everything was great. Fresh ingredients and flavorful.  Ambiance was nothing special, no music, but the place was clean."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious but you'll want to stay away on Friday and Saturday nights. It gets packed and the service declines. My boyfriend and I went a couple of weeks ago and if the food wasn't so delicious, the service would have kept us from returning. Kind of like the soup nazi on Seinfeld; you'll do whatever it takes to get what you want!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ken is not fancy but it takes you to any-town Japan with good food that is very affordable. The menu is highly diverse with tasty items like shumai, ramen and squid snacks that you don't normally find in US-based Japanese places. The dishes are high quality and the cost performance is excellent. Oishii! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is great. Prices not bad. Service could be a lot better.   Food: best deal is the noodle and appetizer combo. Really is a bang for your buck. Noodles taste great. Soup is good.  Not a lot of meat but whatever. Its the appetizer I'm really getting anyways. Mini chiarishi. I could just have that for my meal really. Great fresh fish on Sushi rice.   Every time I go though their service is slow. Whether it's packed or empty and I'm the first customer during lunch. Service will still be slow and I can't figure out why. If you have a large party. I recommend splitting the tables. They charge gratuity and the service drops ten fold.   But I still keep going back for the food. Cause it's that good I guess.."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop sushi place.  We have had consistently good quality sushi at a very good price.  The Ramen noodle soups are very good as well.  Would be 5 stars if the decor was updated and the bathrooms were cleaner.  My wife and I eat here 4 or 5 times a year, have never had any issues."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been here about 5 times already and I've only lived here for 4 months. Everytime I visit it is more and more crowded...maybe word is getting around about their fabulous food. My mother is Japanese, so I know what good authentic Japanese food is and they have it here. I absolutely love the chasu ramen (hot beef broth soup with noodles and thinly sliced roast pork), it is soooo good. I also highly highly recommend their sashimi platter- the fish melts in your mouth and is so fresh! They don't skimp on their sashimi slices either...expect 1 1/2 inch thick slices! And the bonus is that the sushi chefs are from Japan and the owner are as well! True and delicious Japanese cuisine! They have all your typical traditional entrees: sushi, sashimi, ramen, udon, soba, pork kontatsu, curry rice, fried rice, broiled sama, gyoza, katsu-don, tempura....to name a few."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have a huge menu of non sushi items with authentic Japanese Dishes. The place has been around for awhile, but I finally discovered this gem. First of all, they are open 7 days a week! None of this open for only dinner on weekends or crazy stuff.  Sushi came out so fast and everything tasted fresh. I ordered my custom chirashi bowl where you get to pick five different things. I went with spicy salmon, spicy tuna, avocado, masago, and spicy scallops. I was in heaven. I especially loved how I was able to order all that fresh fish without rice and with \"spring mix\"  My husband ordered the chicken katsu and fried rice. Along with a crunch roll. Everything was tasty. They were busy all night and every table was full, but service was great!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food = awesome! Service was lacking, but this place has such a great  variety of Japanese food and sushi!!!! the food makes up for it. my friend and I shared one of their specials (fish cheek? that was huge!) and a specialty roll all for about $20... and we were stuffed! I thought this place is a must-go-back-and-bring-my-friends. (because service was not up to par, I only gave it 4-stars)"}
{"text":"This place is soooo delicious! I hadn't had sushi in a long time and a co-worker recommended Sushi Ken so I took their advice.   First of all, they have a TON of rolls. Just about any roll you can think of is on their menu. They also have great lunch specials for non-sushi meals like chicken teriyaki etc.. I tried the Sweet Potato Roll and Deluxe Dragon Roll, both were awesome! Those are my two favorite rolls at other sushi spots, so I decided to order my usual. At Sushi Ken, the rolls were prepared a bit differently than expected, but different wasn't a bad thing. I think all sushi places have a slightly different recipe for making a roll. I was impressed with Sushi Ken's quality of ingredients. The service was also pretty good. It was lunch time and we didn't wait too long for our food to arrive. Our table of 3 was very happy with everything we ordered and we can't wait to return! Maybe next time, we'll go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I would not necessarily recommend eating sushi here.  There was way too much fish and it made us uncomfortable for the price.  I like high-quality sushi and when eating raw fish, I don't think this is negotiable.  This is not high-quality.  It's high-quantity.  I was pretty disappointed.  Service and ambiance also left much to be desired.    Also, the menu was very confusing.  The descriptions have no prices.  The prices are only on the sushi order sheet which was hiding for the first 30 minutes."}
{"text":"it's a fantastic place, I don't get it why the rating star is so poor, everyone should try it."}
{"text":"A little gem in a strip mall in Ahwatukee.  They're seriously lacking in ambiance but they have great specialty rolls and fantastic lunch specials.  I like the california, cucumber and tuna roll for $8.50.  It comes with salad (with yummy sesame dressing) and miso soup.  My husband is a huge sushi snob and he'll even come here (though it's not his favorite, but like I said, he's a sushi snob).  Their menu is extensive and has lots of choices for the non sushi lovers like katsu (panko breaded and fried meat) and ramen. There's a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"If you're looking for service, you're not going to get it here. It's always the same 2 servers, no matter how busy it gets so while food comes out fast - the servers won't. More than likely, you'll have to get up and go to the cash register or wave them down yourselves. They also have weird rules and fees about splitting checks, so don't do it. I learned the hard way. So if that's not how you like your dining experience, try somewhere else.   BUT, If you're looking for larger than average portions, low prices, and ridiculously good Japanese comfort food - this is it. The menu will probably take you 20 minutes to get through, it's like the Asian equivalent of the Cheesecake Factory when it comes to choices. Don't want to try one plate? They got you covered. They have plenty of options so that you can combine entrees at a low cost. Food moochers paradise! No more having to secretly hope that your friend orders something that you can 'taste test.'   Sushi-wise, I've NEVER seen anywhere else be as generous as they are with their sashimi slices. They have more unique varieties as well and have adopted the soy paper as well. I can go on, but if you must know how good the sushi is, I've spotted the owner of Sakana eating at the sushi bar a couple of times. Scandaloussss."}
{"text":"The food at Sushi Ken is always great. The problem is the service. It took almost 25 minutes to order. Once the food came, we talked about ordering more,  but by the time someone finally checked back in on our table it was too late...we just asked for the check."}
{"text":"We visited Sushi Ken because it is cold and rainy so of course that left us wanting RAMEN!  We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday and the place was surprisingly busy.  By the time we left, all the tables were full as was the sushi bar, and there was a wait!  The menu itself is a little confusing only because there are menus everywhere.  There is the main menu, a sushi menu, a bento box menu, plus signs all over the restaurant about specials and sushi.  Our waitress was pleasant and helped us navigate what specials we could order based on what food we wanted.  The boy wanted Curry Udon and got their daily special of a noodle dish and a choice of app/sushi/roll ($15).  I ordered the Noodle combo and picked Shio Butter Ramen with butter and Gyudon ($13).  I also ordered the White Tuna Tataki from the $5 special menu.  Both items came with a choice of side salad or edamame.   Overall we were very pleased with the food.  My ramen came with traditional toppings and was very rich and hearty.  The Gyudon was a pleasant surprise, just the right amount of savory and sweet.  We both enjoyed the Gyoza app that The Boy got with his combo, the wrapper was crisp and airy and the meat inside was well seasoned.  The Tuna Tataki was good, but was different than I expected.  It came as a roll stuffed with White Tuna and cucumber and then was topped with more White Tuna.  It was worth it for $5 though.  All and all, we both enjoyed our visit and I enjoyed the bill, the two of us left stuffed for $32.  I still keep thinking about the ramen and kick myself for not taking my leftovers home!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to Sushi Ken for remedying my bad days! Staff is friendly and service is very prompt. Came for dinner and ordered a combination of chicken teriyaki and sashimi salmon. The edamame appetizer was very fresh, so it tasted great even when unsalted. Sashimi was delicious as well, and it was plated nicely.  On my first trip here, the chicken itself of the chicken teriyaki was brined to be overly salty and overpowering with the sauce added. Nevertheless, I returned, and this time the staff was able to bring me non-brined chicken with teriyaki sauce on the side so I could customize the saltiness -- and thus my meal ended up perfect.   Overall, super accommodating staff, quick service, and delicious food. KEN not wait to come again!!"}
{"text":"I ll give it one star because it was open for business.  My son and l came in for lunch.  Or so we thought.  We ordered and a few minutes later one soup and one salad plate were served. No dressing in the salad and the green was turning pink at the base. After 10 minutes we asked who it was for and where was the salad dressing. Waiter said soup is for who ever wants it and he took the salad away to put dressing on it. He returned with one more soup bowl and the salad plate.   Another 15 mns passed and one benko plate finally arrived.  We waited 15 more mns for the second benko plate so we can eat together to no avail.  We signed at the waiter to complain about this. My plate was getting cold and my son still didnt have his order.  The waiter replied that it had only been 10 mns and that if he was the customer he would not have said anything or complain and we should be more patient.  My son took it personally ( since he was the customer) and he got even more offended by the waiter's remark. Restaurant Manager came to our table and told us that there was miscommunication between cooks. She offered us a complimentary lunch and confirmed that  food was going to be ready in 5 minutes or so... I replied that l was done with lunch here and l got up.  We left and ended up having lunch at Thai Basil, which by the way served us right away."}
{"text":"best bang for the buck. get the 11$ combo and you would already be filled. if not. get yourself a all day specialty roll for 5$. you wouldnt ever EVER spend more then 20 to be happily walking out the door"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Japanese restaurant.  Non pretentious place with friendly family service.  I take my family here when the day is too busy to eat at home."}
{"text":"Anytime my wife and I can't decide on a place to eat, this is our go to spot. As soon as you walk through the door you're greet with a smile. We like to come during the non peak hours to avoid the rush and not have to worry about seating.   The food never disappoints. When we first started coming here, we'd get the sushi combination. The fish was always fresh and plating was excellent. As we came here more often we became more adventurous. Now, my wife always gets the Spicy Miso Udon. The broth is just like miso soup with an extra kick. The noodles are cooked perfectly and aren't soggy. We always recommend this place to our friends"}
{"text":"We went to sushi ken today. They close at 230 and we arrive at 2:00. We have 30 minutes. Still our waitress thought it was okay to rush us through everything. She was yelling our Orders to the kitchen as we ordered it, grabbing the menus, stood over us almost forcing us to eat faster. It was horrible. And she was so rude, almost like \"wow your going to come in and eat when we're about to close?!\" I didn't tip her well because I thought she a very rude to us. When she saw the ticket all she could say was \"REALLY!? WOW! WOW! WOW! REALLY??\" She didn't even bother to come over and ask what was the problem. Safe to say we won't be going back there"}
{"text":"They've really gone downhill since I've last reviewed them. The last few times I've been here have been sort of disappointing.   The service still is slow, but now the price has gone up. There are more servers, but only a couple seem to know what they are doing leading to a severely understaffed place. I've seen a couple just run around yet not accomplish anything.   The quality of food doesn't seem as high anymore either. The portion size also has shrunk. What draws me back?   It seems like they are cutting corners than trying to be an amazing restaurant. It's no longer a place I really care about going to anymore. Such a shame"}
{"text":"best sushi place EVER!!!! my friend and i are literally addicted and come here at least 4/7 days of the week!! would definitely reccomend to anyone"}
{"text":"I love this cute little place! Very unassuming in the little strip mall. But wow they have really good and pretty authentic (compared to the high price fake stuff in Scottsdale) sushi! The staff are very friendly and attentive to your needs. 2 people can eat her for about 20$ which is not bad compared to most sushi places in the valley. It's a shame there's not more places like this one in the Phoenix area. Worth the drive from north Scottsdale for sure!"}
{"text":"The place was busy the night we went and the service was terrible. They broke my cardinal rule of service and served others  behind us in line first, plus the food was average."}
{"text":"I love this place! This feels to me like the closest thing I imagine an \"authentic\" Japanese place would be.   I highly recommend the salmon tataki - most places do tuna tataki, and Sushi Ken does as well, but the salmon is out of this world...it is my favorite sushi dish anywhere."}
{"text":"You can't buy happiness but you can buy ramen and sushi and that's kind of the same thing.  Le grr.  I was hoping to start the new year off with a 5-star worthy meal!  At least it's not as bad as the Japanese-Mexican fusion place I went to earlier this week.  Yikes.  Anyways, met up with the in-laws today to celebrate my sister-in-law's milestone birthday.  I have never been here before so I jumped onto Yelp last night to see what would catch my eye.  Since it's been pretty chilly due to the winter storm, I was leaning towards ramen.  It ended up being a safe choice after seeing and tasting a little bit of what everyone ordered.  I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen with the Deluxe Dragon Roll on the side.  My ramen came with either salad or edamame and three California rolls.  I should have checked the tips on Yelp because I chose the edamame thinking the warm soybeans would help warm me up as we were seated under the only ceiling fan that appeared to be running.  It was cold and old and I ended up sliding it over the Mr. W. who had a very gross salad.  The California rolls are basic so it's nothing to write home about.  The ramen was satisfying.  Although the noodles seem to be the store-bought variety, I enjoyed the flavor of the miso broth immensely.  Paired with the butter that made the soup base creamy and coat my mouth with a wonderfully richness, I was pretty happy --- even with the hard-boiled egg [I was hoping for a soft-boiled egg].  I wish they had corn instead of bamboo shoots in their ramen but that's just all personal preference.  The chashu in my ramen was also nothing special.  The Deluxe Dragon Roll is a fancified dragon roll with the addition of cream cheese and tempura shrimp.  I also got to try some sashimi that didn't seem all too fresh, a cold lovely-dressed jellyfish salad, and other little bites.  Service was a little lacking but it's understandable since it was super busy.  It was a full-restaurant for the two hours we were there.  If I ever stop in again, I think I want to try their udon."}
{"text":"They have weird split check policies where they enforce 18% gratuity even for a group of 3 people.  I feel like the past 4 times I've been there, there is always something wrong with the check and it makes your night annoying.  It gives me the feeling they are always trying to rip me off somehow.  They really should really fix this and up their customer service.   Their yellowtail is good though and they have nice lunch specials.  My favorite dishes that I always buy is the Mackerel fish ($9.95) and the Sashimi Appetizer dish ($12.95).  Their Sashimi dishes an Chirashi bowl is pretty good too!  I wouldn't recommend their ramen as it is mediocre.  Update: This use to be my favorite sushi taste-wise, and not customer service.  Now I have a new favorite sushi place (Taste-wise).  It's called Makado in Chandler."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Lots of variety of authentic Japanese dishes - Quick and friendly service - Ramen is okay, not the best I ever had - Price is reasonable  Cons: - Tucked away, kind of hard to find when driving down Chandler Blvd.  - Open at certain hours for lunch and then dinner, if you wanted to stop by in between lunch, and dinner when you are home early, then you got to wait until it opens  Will I keep coming back? Sure, its close by the house and the ramen is pretty decent.  Staff is very friendly and the service is quick.  It is a very casual clean place."}
{"text":"Finally decided to stop at this place after driving by it for a few years and was really happy I did. The tempura shrimp and veggies were excellent and I also had the pork ramen bowl and spicy tuna roll.  The sauce served with the sushi was great and did not have any complaints.  The prices for the items I ordered was very reasonable and the dinner total was very fair.  The service was excellent and the wait staff was very accommodating.  The menu is huge and there are plenty of dishes to choose from.  Don't expect the décor to be anything exciting...it's dressed as a typical Chinatown restaurant, which is by no means a bad thing.  I highly recommend giving this place a try, I'll for sure be going again."}
{"text":"this place was just ok. the $13 noodle and rice combo I will say is a great deal and they give big portions! flavors of their ramen were really good. service is definitely slow, as they only have like 2 servers. I'd come back again but it's nothing great."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know how this place gets such good reviews.  It must be the service.  I got take out on this visit so I will assume I missed out on amazing, courteous and attentive service.  Yadda, yadda.  I ordered two easy maki (the spicy tuna and the shrimp tempura roll), some miso soup, edamame, fried rice and chicken teriyaki for two and a half people to eat.  Normally I would order some ahi sashimi or some specialty rolls, but when trying a new sushi place I like to tiptoe into the waters.  SPICY TUNA ROLL:  Presentation? C.  It was ugly.  It looked like the roll had puked up some tuna on top of it.   Taste?  Meh.  It was a little fishy and not AT ALL spicy.  SHRIMP TEMPURA ROLL:  Presentation? B.  Standard.   Taste? Slightly less flavorful than even the bland chains (RA, etc.).  CHICKEN TERIYAKI BOWL:  Presentation? D.  It looked inedible.  There was barely any sauce on the chicken.  It was color-less.  It had a few potatoes and a few pieces of steamed broccoli atop a bowl of white rice.   Taste?  My friend ate it, so I can't comment on taste.  However, his comments ranged from \"Wow, this has NO flavor\" to \"Maybe the cook was off today and they had the busboy making the food.\"  FRIED RICE & EDAMAME: Fried rice was eaten by a three year old who loves rice.  She only picked out the veggies and left the rice.  Hmm.  Edamame was ice-cold (as in, did they just take this out of the freezer and not even fully defrost it?).  I give this place two stars only because it was cheap and the miso soup didn't suck (seems impossible to screw up miso soup, but it happens).  Oh, yeah, and the person who took my order seemed friendly.  Needless to say, it doesn't matter how close Sushi Ken is to my abode.  I will NOT be dining here or ordering food from here again."}
{"text":"I sign up with yelp just to let everyone knows how terrible their service is. Servers have the worse attitude and they are clearly short staffs. We have a party of 10 and it took them 15 minutes before coming over. The only reason they came over was because I got up to ask them. When appetizer arrived, they forgot about mine. Not to mention they didn't bother passing them around the table. They expect us to pass them around on our own. When I asked them about my food, she rolled her eyes. When mine showed up, she said \"EXCUSE ME\" and toss it right in front of me. I ordered a ice-tea and was never asked if i want a refill. Later at night, we have 2 more friends showing up. We tried to get 2 more chairs added to our table and they got so mad and stopped us. They ended up sitting in a different table. I've NEVER gotten this type of horrible service until I came here. I hate this place and will NOT recommend anyone to come here.   P.S. It took them 30-45 minutes for everyone to get their food one at a time. Most of us were already done eating by the time the last plate shows up."}
{"text":"had the chashu ramen. noodles were great, as were the chashu, bamboo, seaweed, and fishcake. the broth was a bit disappointing though. tasted like udon broth. it also comes with salad and three pieces of california roll, so portion sizes are excessive, making two out of one."}
