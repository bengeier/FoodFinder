{"text":"Great Vietnamese Restaurant!  Very clean and delicious Pho! Went there during the RNC and had a fabulous lunch, the broth was outstanding! The beef noodle stir fry was also very tasty.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the spring rolls and Ramen, both were very good.  The service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food and Good service. They aren't stingy with their protein unlike other Vietnamese restaurants. I got the special pho and it was more than enough that I couldn't finish it....their broath is delicious."}
{"text":"First, let me start off that this restaurant is one of the BEST Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland. It is a little hard to find, but worth it.   Our server was very attentive and spoke fluent English, which most ethnic restaurants lack. Communication is key and they nailed it. She recommended the spicy beef noodle instead of the typical pho and it was the most tasteful food I've had in a long time. The broth had a nice heat and red color and the vegetable that came with it was very fresh.   My husband got the beef vermicelli stir fry. He did not talk to me the whole time we were there, their food was that good. We just kept eating. At first we thought the portion was too big but when we started, we couldn't stop.  I will be coming back to try EVERYTHING. Magnificent place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go P9 Is my favorite.  love the server. He's one of the most nicest man. He's so polite and always has a smile on his face."}
{"text":"I found this little place while in Cleveland for work. It was icy cold and I was craving some pho. The waitress recommended the spicy pho and I am sold. Delicious, spicy and fresh and just what I needed!  I'll be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"I always order delivery and occasionally stop in.  They get my order right every time!! The food is amazing and very authentic. I love pho, I grew up on it so whenever I'm not feeling well or it's just cold with winter weather I always order pho and it's just like my moms! Every time I order I can always expect the same thing, delicious food!  Definitely recommend this restaurant.  Even when I dine in the staff is always so nice and quick."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fried rice is a must try. Variety of soups, chicken soup was decent and tasty! Great salad comes free with entree!!"}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland for a business trip and had a craving for some Vietnamese food last night luckily I found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try we took a cab there from the Renaissance hotel which only cost $5 bucks and the place was pretty empty which was great because I knew that we would get fast service. The lemongrass chicken was amazing and the pho was very tasty well. I just found out they do deliveries to the hotel so I placed an order again, yay!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. Great service our food came out very fast. Delicious pho and a nice place to eat! Would highly recommend it. It is the best place for pho that I have found in cleveland."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had!  Make sure to start with the chargrilled pork rolls and the spicy beef pho was amazing.  This place is the best thing about Cleveland - great food and service!"}
{"text":"The spicy beef noodle soup was very flavorful, ask for chili oil on the side to kick up the spice! The pork on the banh me was crisp also good! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food!  I tried their bun with grilled shrimp and it was delicious!  I'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Definitely hit the spot. I had the #9 (Chicken Pho) take out and the garden rolls for take out. It was FAST and by the time I (finally) got back to my hotel, they were both still hot and delicious. All veggies tasted very fresh. What else can you ask for?? Except maybe that they be closer to my hotel :)"}
{"text":"The service here was phenomenal. I was in and out in under 30 minutes for lunch. That was pretty much the best part of the meal.   I ordered the vegetarian vermincelli and it was very meh. The description of it includes among other things, lime and cilantro (I'm a huge fan of both) but when the dish arrived it contained neither of those ingredients. Also, the sauce that came on top was far too sweet.  I also wish they had a vegetarian option for their spicy beef noodle soup, which seems to be very popular."}
{"text":"Trying for the first time.  Excellent pho.  Simple.  Nothing fancy.  Hot oil is very hot!!!  I like it!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having completed my second meal in 7 days at Pho Thang Cafe, I can say that the food is delicious!  Last week I had, I had family visiting from San Francisco and Seattle, so I took them here, and they loved it as well.  My first meal was Com Suron Nurong (Grilled Pork with steamed rice with fresh vegetables) and a mango bubble tea.  Fantastic.  My dinner tonight started out with an appetizer of delicately wrapped rice paper spring rolls, STUFFED with shrimp and fresh veggies.  My entre was  Bun Thit Nurong, Grilled Pork in Vermicelli, with just the right hint of curry. And of course, i had to go with the fun bubble tea (tea, with milk and big globes of chewy tapioca sipped through a mega straw).  I took our waitress' suggestion and chose the taro flavor.  The purple drink was so delicious I had to order two!  Tonight I shared dinner and great conversation with good friends, and the restaurant space was very comfortable, airy, with beautiful music playing in the background.  We all enjoyed talking with the restauranteur, Nancy, a native of Vietnam, who has worked night and day to launch this business.  Her family works at this beautiful 5,000 square foot restaurant that sits along Rockwell Avenue (alongside East Ninth) in the Superior Building.  Our waitress was Nancy's daughter,  chemical engineering student at Ohio  State University, who relocated back to Cleveland, transferred to Cleveland State University, so she can help her mom and dad with the restaurant.  Wow, how can we not support these immigrant entrepreneurs, making Cleveland a better place by sharing this mouth-watering, Vietnamese cuisine? I plan on having many meals here, conducting some of my business meetings  here, and even hosting some of our community events here.   Check it out."}
{"text":"Very authentic. Even better Pho than some places in Southern California.  I ordered take out. It was ready on time and warm when I got to the hotel."}
{"text":"Phorget Superior, #1, and everyone else.  Phriendly service, great decor, vast menu, decent prices (especially for Downtown) and the best bowl of Pho in town.  When working in CLE, I make every Phriday a \"Pho-Phriday\"!"}
{"text":"I stop in for lunch here every few weeks and it is always the same:  Fast service, awesome food and great prices!  I love this place.   I like my food spicy and it is sometimes a challenge to get the server/chef to spice things up, but the food quality is always top notch. I really appreciate the fast service when I'm in a rush!"}
{"text":"The better half and I usually order the pork vermicelli and white meat chicken noodle soup.  Always consistent and delicious (and reasonably priced)."}
{"text":"First the good news. The service here is great, everyone is friendly and helpful.  The food comes quickly.  There were multiple return visits by the wait staff to see if all was well.     The ambience is ok, not great; but better than I expected from the pictures which are accurate.       The food is not ok.   The most obvious example was the various meats included in the meals.   They are essentially thin slices of \"lunch meat\".  A large bowl of spicy hot pho had two small jalapeño slices on the side. On a heat scale of 1 to 5 it was 1/2.  The Chinese sausage roll had strips of processed meat instead of ground or chunks.  The flavor overall was very average.     There are much better choices for Vietnamese food within a few minutes drive, though none have better service.   If I was rating on food alone I would not have rated this highly."}
{"text":"I guess I'm used to better Vietnamese food living in a larger city. I found Pho Thang on Yelp during a business trip to Cleveland. I ordered my goto Vermicelli salad with grilled pork and egg roll. The salad, noodles, and egg roll were fine, but the pork left a lot to be desired. Instead of freshly grilled, it was glazed as if it was part of a dish more appropriate to Pei Wei fast food. It lacked taste and had a strange texture.   I give three stars because it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Excellent menu and excellent food!  With all the good reviews we thought this place had been open for years, we got to meet the very lovely owner who told us they just opened 7 months ago.  Don't miss this place, the food and staff are amazing!!!  No liquor license yet but they encourage bringing your own beer or wine."}
{"text":"We tried for the first time tonight and extremely impressed. Spicy beef soup and  garden rolls were absolutely fabulous.   Not much of a night spot. Only 3 tables with people at night. Also difficult to park.   Be aware....no liquor license, but you can bring your own bottles.   We shall return!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and I really believe it is the best pho in Cleveland! Susan is so friendly and always remembers us by name. He food is delicious and has a great location if you are downtown."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was really good. Pho Tai is a must have if you go to this restaurant. I will go here again anytime I am in Cleveland. An A+ from me."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, plentiful, but so very good. I usually get the phone nam, which is the beef brisket pho and it's pho-nam-inal!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch last Saturday while visiting friends in Cleveland. The lunch specials were VERY reasonably priced, portions were HUGE and the flavors in the food were DELICIOUS. We tried the spring rolls, shrimp and pork garden rolls, chicken with rice noodles, cabbage salad, and the house special beef pho. It was enough food to feed us both twice...I could hardly wait to devour the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Our friends who live in Cleveland eat here often, they love it. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll eat there again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I think they have the best pho in Cleveland. Better than superior pho in my opinion. My fav pho spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy noodle soup with pork legs, I must admit it was the worst noodle pho I've ever had so far in my life! The pork legs were very rubbery, the soup was a lot compared to the noodle and so you have to dig through the soup to find the noodle! This meal should not be put on the menu at all! This soup cost about $10-$12 + tax and basically you just drink the soup and have to struggle chewing on the nasty pork feet. This soup also smells nasty!"}
{"text":"Anybody that knows anything about pho knows it's the broth that makes the difference. I knew this was going to be good almost before I had my first taste because the broth was a nice savory color - still clear - but dark enough to know that it  harbors flavor.   My lunch mate and I tried the Chinese sausage spring rolls - the fried spring rolls and also split a bahn mi sandwich. We were stuffed but satisfied. It's reassuring to know that there is another decent place in CLE for Vietnamese food - especially as a few of the old standards have been slipping lately (I'm talking to you #1 Pho).  The service was a bit confused but trying hard to please. I think this will settle down as they are open for a bit more - as long as the food stays as delicious I'll be back."}
{"text":"They are not as good as the reviews. The ramen noodle was too dry, the pho was not the authentic Vietnamese pho."}
{"text":"I got off the Greyhound stop on a cold November evening, and was craving pho to warm me up.  Pho Thang delivered!  They have two separate entrances, one of which is a little confusing.  But once I made it inside, I was warmly greeted.  The pho was fantastic and very filling!  It was great.  I also ordered iced Vietnamese coffee with sweetened condensed milk- sounds like an odd pair but it was a great complement!"}
{"text":"Loved the variety of the menu.  Service was friendly and fast, tried it based on Yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed.  I had a hard time deciding what to get and finally settled on one of the noodle dishes.  It was a generous portion and neither my daughter or I finished our dinners.  Best part - the reasonable prices.  Would definitely recommend it for families, not sure they had a children's menu though."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Stopped in for lunch after Rock and Roll HOF. Only 4-5 blocks.   Had the Goi Cuon shrimp garden roll. Very flavorful. Nice peanut sauce.   Then the classic Vietnamese  Pho Thang house special. Excellent. Large bowl. Lots of meats. Served bean sprouts separately so you add them as you eat and they do not get soft.   Definitely return when downtown."}
{"text":"So-So! O.K. It pains me to write this 3 star review because I so wanted to love this place based on it' s previous reviews. My hubby and I went there last week to try it out after I have sworn off Mihn-Anh for their horrible service. You can read my review for them to understand.   We found this cute, clean restaurant which is located in the building attached next to the Hampton Inn on Superior and East 9th in downtown Cleveland. We walked in around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon to find that there were 2 other tables occupied. Rather empty but the weather outside was horrible. Snowing like crazy. We decided to make the 1 hour trek there non the less just so I could try the Pho that many raved about. I got their special P7:  Pho Tang Pho and my hubby ordered the C7: Chicken with Lemon Grass and Chili. Our waitress was great. Very nice. I would give them 5 stars for that.   I received my huge bowl of Pho and noticed there were lots of good looking cuts of meat in it. I must say the cuts of meat were better than any other Pho places around. I like the fact that it had tripe in it and it was thoroughly cleaned. I however was disappointed with the broth. While others claim that they enjoy the clear broth, I found it peppery and yet very bland. Not very flavorful at all. I could not pickup on any star anise, cinnamon or even the rich flavor that you would get from the ox tail. It almost tasted package made.   My hubby's dish was good but not out of this world great. For $25 including tip I didn't really think it was worth it. Might give it a chance again to try their Bahn Mi since I like their meats but I probably won't rush there any time soon."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that if you come here on a Sunday (like I did) and you have never been here before (like me) enter through the entrance on Rockwell not Superior. Google Maps will tell you Superior and the website for this restaurant doesn't mention another entrance. My boyfriend and I tried every door before calling to ask how to get in (ha ha). I was ready to give up but then he called and the Host/Waiter told us the main entrance is on Rockwell but came and let us in through the Superior doors (so confusing).  My boyfriend and I are on the quest to try all the Pho in NEO and with all the good reviews here on Yelp this is why we chose this place as our most recent stop.  Once we sat down I noticed how nice and clean this restaurant looks! Our waiter was very friendly and brought out our food in a timely manner so that we could enjoy everything separately and not all at once. We each ordered a combination meal including a Spring Roll, Pho and Drink. We also ordered a BBQ Pork Bahn Mi. The Bahn Mi was good but I think from now on I will stick to a traditional Bahn Mi (I just have a thing for asian BBQ Pork and always need to have it when it's available). The Pho was good as well and so hot I burned my tongue but that is because I am always so pumped to eat Pho! The broth was good but I couldn't pinpoint why it wasn't as good as other places but don't get me wrong this was a decent bowl of Pho. Overall we had a good experience once we got into the building! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the ratings here are so high... food was just meh when I visited. I ordered the pork Banh mi (which other Yelpers touted as the best in Cleveland), garden rolls, and spring rolls. Garden rolls were standard. Spring rolls weren't even hot and filling was bland. But that Banh Mi? So disappointing. The pictures make it look so great but it totally didn't deliver in taste. Kinda dry chunks of meat, not flavorful, and way too few veggie toppings. And the veggie toppings that were on weren't as fresh and crisp and crunchy as I would've lived. Maybe I came on an off day but I wouldn't recommend this place for the Bahn mi. Hopefully the pho is good?"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the pho, as this is the only menu item I have tried as of yet. I tried the beef pho with well done brisket, it was excellent. The broth was so flavorful, fresh and delicious. The beef wasn't too fatty and they did give me a pretty good amount, especially for the $9 I paid. I did take out and I was worried that I wouldn't have a large enough bowl to fit all my soup (as I eat every bite) but this place is smart, they provide you with a nice sized disposable bowl for you to use. To be honest, this is probably my favorite beef pho I have had as of yet. The restaurant itself is new and quite clean and simple on the inside. It was large too, larger than I expected. The staff that I came into contact with were young, beautiful and speak perfect english. My order was taken correctly and I was greeted immediatly and assisted just as quick. So happy that they are in close walking distance to my work, this made my week."}
{"text":"Clearly the secret's out and everyone knows that the Bun Bo Hue/spicy beef noodle is fantastic especially with pig's feet! But what also blew me away were the perfectly charbroiled pork rolls!!! Btw I love how the staff get to know the customers and know what I want :)"}
{"text":"A few months back, my husband and I took a weekend trip to Cleveland. On one of our walks from the hotel, we saw this restaurant. Vietnamese is one of my favorite cuisines, so we decided to try this place for lunch. I have many food allergies, so eating at any restaurant can be hard, but Pho Thang Cafe made it easy for me to eat there. We talked to our server about my dietary restrictions and he sent a young woman to our table (the owner perhaps?). She was so helpful, she used a takeout menu to circle all the things I can have on the menu. I ordered the bun vermicelli which is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes. Pho Thang Cafe's version was excellent. Though I don't remember what my husband got, I know he enjoyed his meal as well. I would absolutely recommend Pho Thang Cafe. In fact, I kept the takeout menu with the notes in case I'm able to get back to Cleveland- if I do I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"I typically visited here on my lunch because I work in the area. Their pho is pretty good, and that's pretty much the only thing I get there.  The portions are quite large, but you can take pho to go. The prices are pretty reasonable as well. They also serve a jasmine tea that's alright."}
{"text":"All the reviews about this place are true - it's very good. I'm not going to reiterate them all, but please check it out if you're in the area. Good food, served fast. Large servings. Clean and classy looking restaurant and great service.   The crispy spring rolls, are amazing. I've never cared for spring rolls before, but these are excellent.  The only problem is the lack of parking. I work nearby so know where to park or I walk to Pho Thang, but I think it's worth any parking hassle."}
{"text":"Good Food! Good Service! Decor ok! Good Price! I would come again when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love their bun bo hue and rice dishes. The pho here is so much better than superior pho! And the grilled pork roll is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"we have been back. everything was as it should be. Busy lunch crowd now, but very efficient. Wish it was closer to home. I'd be there once a week"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a very friendly group of people running the place. I wish I could provide a more critical review that's more helpful but I have only had about three items from the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"No complaints aside from the building being confusing if you haven't been there before. Entrance is actually not on Superior but on the other side, not sure what street since I'm not from here. It is right next to the Hampton Inn.  Egg rolls are loaded and taste wonderful!  I ordered the pork chop and pork roll combo and I added grilled chicken and 3 fried eggs! So delicious! All for $20!  Inside is clean and with only 2 people working and a very busy convention in town they handled the traffic really well on this Saturday night."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Especially after browns games to warm up.  The Bahn mi is awesome and the spices broth beef pho is my personal favorite.  The staff are super friendly and the family goes out of Their way to make you feel at home.  Watch out for karaoke night, cause most of the guests can't sing a lick."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Waitress knew the menu inside and out. Large bowls of flavorful Pho!  I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Second visit in just as many nights. Great food with great service. Both the Deluxe Rice and Shrimp Ramen were delicious. Crispy Spring Rolls are a must have appetizer. I don't know how you can go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Great Pho! Great service! Great price!  This is an excellent lunch spot. Very speedy, efficient service. The vietnamese coffee was ok, there is a weird burnt taste to it so I'm guessing it's the roast. The Pho had a nice complex broth flavor and was served perfect."}
{"text":"First time having Vietnamese. First off... Ugh downtown! Haven't been in the heart of downtown in years. It's like a foreign land if it's not your norm.  On to the food. I don't have anything to base my experience on food wise. But the people were nice from taking my order over the phone..she was patient with me with not knowing exactly what I was ordering, to the guy having to let me in the locked door on Superior Ave so I didn't have to hop in the car to go to some other street to enter. Everything was fresh and it was nice that they were sure to give me all the sauces and garnishing's as if I were eating in. I really liked the strawberry milky drink with the fruity gelatin balls. If I get a taste for Vietnamese I'll would go back.  Everything I got was $29 and I'll eat from it 3-4 times."}
{"text":"This is my weekly Vietnamese fix go to!!!  I like to order there bun (vermicelli), chicken pho, bun bo que, marinated grilled pork banh mi, spring/garden rolls, and my dad like the grilled pork chop rice special. I love the chicken pho and the garden rolls with peanut sauce. I think their food is very authentic and even my Vietnamese/Chinese parents approved it. My parents never approve any places I choose when I take them out. So if my parents like it, it must be good!!! It's a must try, this place is a little hidden gem. Parking can be difficult bc it's in downtown, luckily I'm only 5 min walk away. Don't feel weird if you go there and it's empty around dinner time, it's a place that crazy packed during lunch. The family that owns it is super nice, and always friendly."}
{"text":"Ok, so The Wife and I were pretty pumped about checking out this place since all the Yelp reviews have been really positive.  We like Superior Pho and all, but it's definitely not the best we've had, compared to other places in the country.  We had high hopes that this place would offer a better bowl of pho than SP.  I fear we'll have to keep looking.  First of all, I know I'm a suburanite and everything but finding this place wasn't easy.  Google maps takes you to a place right off Superior but it's better to go to the 777 Rosalyn parking garage because parking around there sucks and it's right across the street from the garage.   The restaurant itself is relatively large for an Asian restaurant and a little classier looking than Superior Pho.  We order 2 bowls of beef pho, one bowl of spicy beef noodle soup, one Chinese sausage roll and one ham sandwich banh mi.  The pho was OK. It tasted home made, not an MSG bomb, which I appreciate.  But it didn't have the depth of flavor that the best pho places I've tasted have. They didn't have tendon, which kinda stinks and we both noted that it wasn't hot hot when we got it.  The quality of the vegetation was quite good however.   Banh mi wise, we liked the nicely toasted bread but our order didn't come with the BBQ pork that was listed on the menu.  When we asked out it, our waiter stammered something about it behind optional but there was literally nothing on the menu about optional BBQ pork- it was listed as an item in the sandwich- just say there was a mistake and fix it, son!  He offered to bring it so we accepted.  It was thin shaved BBQ pork- looked better than it tasted. Chinese char siu is better, by a fair amt. Also, banh mi would have been better with some sort of pate- many of the others that I have had this in it.   The spicy beef soup was disappointing. One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.  Siam Cafés rendition is much better.  This one tasted flat.  Not a ton of beef flavor and not that spicy.  Overall, honestly, especially with having to pay $6 for parking for an hour across the street and being able to get individual dishes that are better elsewhere, I don't know if I'll be coming back to this place.  If I lived downtown, I'd probably still consider it, but there are still better places in Asia town.  Honestly, this is a generous 4 star review- my sister would probably have given this place a 3."}
{"text":"Great little Pho place! We came in right at noon on a Friday and the place was packed but we received prompt and friendly service. Extensive menu, in both Vietnamese and English. Spring rolls were amongst the best I've ever had, in a thin crispy shell and loaded with generous chunks of tasty pork. I tasted the garden roll my wife ordered and it was also very tasty. A thin wrapper without even a hint of chewiness and the perfect balance of shrimp and basil on the inside. We both had the pho with top round steak and it was fabulous. Spicy delicious broth, meat was plentiful, tender, and delicious, perfectly cooked noodles. Can't think of anything to criticize here. Perfect execution of this type of lunch place"}
{"text":"Great, cheap and delicious pho in the city. Tender eye round and a rich broth that's a little sweet. Worth a shit and 8.95!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best pho in Cleveland, you can find it here. This is my favorite Vietnamese place in the area. I have dined in a couple of times, and gotten take out too. Take out pho is never the same as having it in a restaurant, but they do an incredible job of packing it up for you. Everything has its own little baggy or container. I'm probably making too big of a deal of that, but it is a really nice touch. Aside from the pho, I have tried the grilled pork bahn-mi, the spring rolls, the grilled pork vermicelli, and the pork fried rice. I enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great dinner here - Superb pho, great garden rolls, and a delicious pork dish. The service was fabulous. We would eat here again in a second if we find ourselves in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"The Pho was good!  Just one guy working the dining room, he may have been cooking too?  Not sure. Long wait. Atmosphere is drab. That brownish rug..  Good food though!  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, extensive menu, delicious food. Loved the bahn mi and the spring rolls. Pho was average. The broth didn't have as much flavor as it should. Server was very accommodating as my picky daughter didn't love any of the menu items as is but they customized something for her. If go back again!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from the vegetarian menu, everything was delicious and the service was so fast"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch downtown. There are definitely better pho places in Asia Town, Superior Pho, for example, but this place is convenient, the staff is friendly, I like sitting at the bar and having a warm cup of tea and a big bowl of soup in front of me. The garden rolls are good too. Pho Thang is in my building so you can't beat the convenience, FYI the main entrance is off Rockwell, not Superior."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to stop in Cleveland. I did some touring by myself and after the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I found this gem of a restaurant. Upon arrival, I was quickly seated and waited on. I just got water and a simple pho bowl, but it was tasteful nonetheless. The atmosphere is great too! The servers were chatting with regulars the whole time I was there, and there seemed to be quite a few regulars, even for a Tuesday lunchtime. Appropriately priced (my pho was $10) and a great bite to eat."}
{"text":"Sorry but not going to make it. Great if it were in the suburbs but in downtown trying to make do in an old bar with only fair cuisine. Prices are okay but pho broth pretty bland and I always question the wisdom of slicing beef balls to make it seem like more...what do they cost like $3 for a package of 20. Charge a little more and give customers a good food experience."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland and this place was next to my hotel.  Decided to give it a try.  I got the beef noodle special and the garden spring roll.    I judge the beef noodle soup by the broth before adding any condiments.  The beef broth was good.  I dig it and enjoyed it without anything other than lemon.  Between light broth and heavy broth, I give this one a moderate.  The meat was good except for the meatballs.  While the meatballs are better than most I've tried, they failed in comparison to meatballs used in other pho joints, mostly in California.  The garden spring roll was good.  Has everything in it as expected.  The ratios of veggies in it was higher than I am used to but I enjoyed it.  Overall, it's a fairly authentic place for Vietnamese pho.  It is satisfying enough if you're from places with better food like California.  I would come back again.  Only one minor thing I didn't like.  The waiter only talked to me once.  He asked what I wanted to drink.  He didn't say another word to me afterwards.  I gave him my order then he grab the menu and walked away without a word.  Didn't say anything when he brought me my order.  Didn't stop by once during the meal.  Didn't say anything when he walked past and dropped the check on my table.  Didn't say anything when he walked by and grabbed the check.  I left him a bigger tip than I think he deserves.  I understand he was the only one there but I think service involves more than a shrug of the shoulders.  At the end of the day, food was good.  Service was meh.  Then again, it's a Vietnamese restaurant.  You should expect shitty service."}
{"text":"The pho was perfect! I love Pho so much that I make it for myself at home. Pho Thang cafe serves a generous helping with a perfect balance of noodles, beef, broth, cilantro, green onions. The broth had a perfect soft brown color with deep and delicate flavors, it was delicious and couldn't be better. Even the basil was nice and fresh served on the side. Nice service staff. Pleasant dining room with a bar.   Some Pho is too sweet with too much brown sugar, some Pho places have wilted bean sprouts and basil, some are served in questionable dining areas, some  taste like it was microwaved. This place is not like the others and is JUST RIGHT.    Can't wait to go back because it was the best Pho I've had yet."}
{"text":"I was really excited because yet another Vietnamese restaurant has opened up! Yay! Half my family is culturally Vietnamese and I'm always looking for the most legit place to eat when I'm not visiting family. It took me forever to try this since I've been out of town and read that parking is only free on the weekends, ugh.  Immediately after sitting down, we asked for iced water and tea. My iced water came with a fuzzy larva bug right floating on top. Horrifying, as that happened in the first minute of sitting down. They charge for tea here.  So we got: Banh Mi Thit Nuong: had pate inside, which is fairly unusual. Meat was on the sweeter side. Came cut in half, with pickled daikon/carrots on the side.  Bun Bo Hue: One of the oiliest bowls of BBH I've had in my life. The oil/fat started forming a skin at the top. Several times I had to wipe my spoon and chopsticks of the oil that stuck onto it. Otherwise, the right flavors were present. Not as spicy as Ninh Kieu's. Missing the pork leg (many Yelpers commented on getting one, I guess my friend and I missed out on it).   Prices are more expensive than in Asiatown. Everything feels nicer here, so you pay for that too. This includes tablecloths, cloth napkins, sandwiches cut in half with pickled carrots/daikon on the side, a plate under the bowl, rectangular serving plates...This is the first time in recent memory I've seen that at a Vietnamese place. Man, either my family and I eat at crappy places, or we've been doing it wrong for decades. Or I have bad memory. Since my family is awesome, I'm going to go with the last one.  Street parking is free on the weekends, otherwise...have fun. Unfortunately, due to the parking, questionable cleanliness, excessive oil and higher prices, I don't think you'll see me here again.  As I left, I noticed a sign that advertised a free cabbage salad with purchase of an entree that had been turned away from the door when I walked in. Just FYI."}
{"text":"My favorite pho joint in cleveland. Fast and fresh service is tough to compete with. I recommend a vegetarian pho bowl( i do not get the tofu in it though) and a shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce. Im a person that can literally \"eat a cow\" and that is a perfect amount of food to have you feeling rejuvenated. Also, the real hangover cure lol."}
{"text":"Dear Cleveland Yelp,  You guys are awesome. Really, you guys are.  It was the Saturday after Thanksgiving and and the fiancee and I decided to split our 14-16 hour drive from Indiana back to Jersey into two legs with Cleveland being our rest stop. We drove into Cleveland at around 8:30 PM and things were closing as we continually searched for places to eat while checking into our hotel.  This place popped up and it closed late.  I was a little bit apprehensive because I am a little bit of an asian food snob. Because I'm, you know, a Chinese dude from the SF Bay Area and I have been burned by positive Yelp reviews on random Asian places since I've left California.  I did not get burned here, and for that, you guys are totally awesome.  First, the pho broth was phenominal, the spices, onion and  there but it just had a meaty brothiness that I have not had in a long, long time. There's good pho broth, and there's an extra level. The pho broth here is that extra level. Also highly recommended is the cabbage salad, the only thing I can say about it is that all it needed was just a little bit extra funk.  This is also some of the best Banh Mi that doesn't cost an arm and a leg since I left the Bay Area.  If I'm ever back in Cleveland, I will return for another meal."}
{"text":"After walking by this place for years, I finally stopped in to try it out. The space itself is very clean, open, and tastefully decorated. Although the menu lacks the size options typical of other Vietnamese restaurants, the portions here are huge! I got a dinner combo (#2 I think?) and bahn mi while my boyfriend got the #2 Pho. I ordered the garden spring roll with my combo and I thought it was excellent! The pho (#4) was fantastic and the broth was excellent. All those fat bubbles you want were there and the flavor was on point. I'm also typically very picky with my bahn mis- the bread needs to be perfectly crunchy, the vegetables should be pickled just right- and the bbq pork bahn mi here did not disappoint.   The service was great! Our waitress was so nice, easy to make conversation with, and truly made me eager to return."}
{"text":"By far the best pho in Cleveland.  They give very large and hearty portions, the staff is very attentive and pleasant, and the location is well kept and clean.  They also do not dilute their hoisin (someone that many other pho restaurants do) which means that they are the real deal."}
{"text":"Great food and service. One of the most overlooked asian restaurants in Cleveland. I highly recommend the chicken pho."}
{"text":"My lunchtime stop for pho.  Really flavorful broth.  They make a great bahn mi, too!"}
{"text":"The food is super authentic. I had the bun bo hue, and it was so close to what my mom would make. The staff i prompt and sweet and i felt at home there. You might get lost looking for the restaurant the first time, but walk through the hallways and look hard because i promise the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Great pho place in downtown. This place is only a block from my office and my apartment so I eat lunch here and grab takeout fairly often. Everything I've tried on the menu thus far has been fantastic.   The beef pho is outstanding. Its the perfect bowl of warm, flavorful broth, noodles, and tender beef. The chicken pho is also delicious, but I found the broth not as flavorful. Please please try the charbroiled pork rolls, they are outstanding. Make sure you ask for the peanut sauce with them instead of the lime sauce that normally comes with them. I could eat just those pork rolls and be a happy girl. My boyfriend always orders the beef ramen and refuses to stray because he likes it so much.   The place is owned and operated by a local family, which I really appreciate. The staff is always friendly and attentive. If you're downtown you definitely need to check it out!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I had the opportunity of trying out the Pho thang, the Bun Bo Hue and the Com Chien ga, one word- impressed! The broth is perfectly seasoned and fresh ( as compared to the salty broths u get in most Vietnamese restaurants). The menu options were pretty extensive and appetizing. The customer service is also second to none. Quite a big space with welcoming atmosphere, will certainly be ideal for big parties..unfortunately there's no liquor ( I was told they are in the process of obtaining a liquor license). My third visit in 1 week!Certainly the best Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Place was great. Service and food were fast. Spring roles and pho were tasty and authentic. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Still coming to Pho Thang on the regular.  A few notes - their bun bo hue is super good. It's spicy and oily and delicious - it includes hock (pig's feet) which you can order with/without. I prefer it and find that this offering is unique to all the other Vietnamese restaurants.  Still highly recommend the bun (vermicelli) and the shrimp/cabbage appetizer.  Ramen - this was one of the only dissatisfying items on their menu - it was salty and the noodles seemed like they came out of a low quality ramen packet."}
{"text":"We happened to past by this pho place since it was next door to our hotel for our convention, and all I can say is WOW! I have probably been to over 20 pho places back in LA and this is probably the absolute best place to go to! First off we came in the server Steven greeted us and sat us right away and the food came out right away. We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and it was very amazing! A lot of flavor and usually when we have pho places give very little meat but this place is very generous on meat and it's flavor! Also, me and my brother ordered the coffee and completely forgot about it and Nancy not sure if she was the owner or a server but was VERY kind enough to suggest to have it as iced coffee and it was even more amazing! Can't thank this place enough for making our Cleveland experience amazing! Thanks Nancy and Steven !"}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese sandwich and pho. I was thrilled with service, and the waitress was very sweet and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Your average pho.  I arrived at Cleveland's Port Authority and it was a quite windy day. I wanted to drink some soup so I found this place not too far away. I came here for my pho and left with a satisfied stomach. I don't know what else to add to my review because it wasn't anything extraordinary and it had exactly what I was expected from a Vietnamese restaurant.  --  taste / 3 aesthetics / 3 vibe / 3 service / 3 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 3"}
{"text":"Excellent pho!  No liquor license, though, which is one certain improvement they could make.  Decor is in need of a re-do."}
{"text":"Great Thai Tea.  They had a really good Deluxe Fried Rice that included shrimp, chicken and pork.  My sister had a really good white meat chicken noodle soup and my niece had a chicken and beef ramen noodle platter.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Pork sandwich appetizer is superb.  The portions are generous, so be ready to eat.  We got a bunch of appetizers and especially love the pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Been her several times. Good food each time. Spring rolls are a particular favorite for everyone I know. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Pho thang is \"A-ok\" in my book!   This is a great place to grab a quick lunch. It's really only convenient if you work downtown, and since I fit that criteria, it's super convenient for me!  The food is pretty good. I typically get pho, eye of round, served rare. I feel like there isn't a lot of meat within the big bowl they give you, which is kind of sad. I feel like I have to be careful not to eat all of it too quickly. I hate rationing myself!With that being said, I truly believe that pho is all about good broth, which pho thang does very well!   The service is pretty good here. It does get a little crazy during the lunch rush, but you can still be in and out of here in under an hour."}
{"text":"In short, the food is delicious and the service is wonderful.  If you enjoy Vietnamese food, make sure to visit Pho Thang Cafe.  First, the location.  It's a bit hard to find, as it's actually on a small alley.  It's around the corner from the Hampton Inn, and the alley is directly across from Subway.  Not sure where to park, as I was staying at the Hampton and just walked over.  THE FOOD!  I ordered the pho, and it was absolutely delicious.  The meat was perfect, the broth was delicious and everything was extremely fresh.  It's easily the best pho I've ever had, beating out all of the other Cleveland pho restaurants.  Of course, the portion was huge.  Our server gave us free bean pudding, which was super tasty.  Not super sweet, it has a weird texture, but is very, very good.  Also, they have bubble tea, which I didn't try, but plan on having the next time I visit.  Everything appears to be house-made, which is probably why it's so good.  The service was fabulous.  I visited the day the cafe opened, and the restaurant was empty the entire time I was there.  Our server was attentive, and I was visited by a few employees during my time there.  Everyone was very nice.  Overall, I love this place.  The food and service are both fantastic, and the prices are excellent as well."}
{"text":"I am by no means a expert on Vietnamese food, but I know the food I ate here was excellent.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Way better than superior pho! You know it's authentic when your server is an old Vietnamese lady."}
{"text":"Last stop on the Cleveland tour and this was one of the best. I've been a phan of of pho for years, but haven't had much chance to dine on the cuisine. Then when the video came out about eating pho the wrong way exploded for all the wrong reasons, I actually started craving pho again.  We came when both the Browns and Indians game had started so the place was pretty much empty when we walked in. There were a few small tvs on the side we were on that showed the game.    I was going to go with my go to pho, but our friends recommended the rice plate special which was quite good and it came with soup as well. I was definitely content with the meal and am glad we got to stop by."}
{"text":"Got Pho Tai. I liked the broth. They did a good job on that. The noodles tasted like they came from a package. The beef was just OK. Good for hangover fix..not a place I'd drive more than 7 minutes for."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I have visited. On my trip to Cleveland I stayed at the Westin and the staff suggested we tried this place if we were in the mood for Asian food. It was only a 1-2 block walk from the hotel.   We arrived and were promptly seated and offered the menu. We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the special pork and shrimp noodle bowl. Both were delicious and we did not left much on the plate. The prices were unbelievable reasonable and overall we were very happy with our choice. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Out of town and hungry for something different. This place has excellent reviews so I have it a shot. Bahn Mi's are one of my favorite sandwiches of all times. The bahn mi is pretty good but just doesn't stand up to the bahn Mi's I've had in NY. But this isn't NY. It's Cleveland. So, by Cleveland standards, and I imagine Vietnamese restaurants are few and far between, it was pretty good. I also got the spring rolls which were great!  If I had more time here, and if it was cold, I'd try out the Pho, which I imagine is excellent.   Pretty good over all. If you haven't had Vietnamese food, it about time to sample what wonderful flavors are at hand."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes without getting hello or a glass of water.  Left and went to Sausalito 's."}
{"text":"This was actually 4.5 stars.  I am always skeptical of trying Pho at restaurants other than Superior Pho, but this place comes pretty darn close.  This place is a short walk from my job and I see the sign each morning as I enter the parking garage.   It is a little hard to find with entrances off of Superior and one off of Rockwell.  The Yelp reviews are spot on, this was pretty good stuff!  I ordered the #3 Pho which included Flank and Round Steak.  The soup arrived in a huge bowl, the ratio of noodles to broth was slightly different than Superior Pho.  Pho Thang included more broth and fewer noodles, but the broth was nicely flavored.  Also included the usual accompaniments, sprouts, peppers, basil and lime.  I also ordered 2 spring rolls, which were more like egg rolls but still very tasty.  My friend ordered the shrimp vermicelli noodles and she loved it.  The staff was super nice and eager to please.  Will DEFINITELY return......soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. I was literally walking down the street from my hotel and saw a pho sign on the corner and told myself i need to go there later. I had came back from a conference and went to the gym and realized that i was really hungry. I had gone over to the pho place and was welcomed by two of the nicest people. Nancy had given such great suggestions on what to order and everything that came out was delicious! Bahn mi sandwich was bomb the iced coffee was and also the spicy beef noodle soup and the egg rolls pretty much everything here was great. Greatest service i ever received from a pho restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner with my family. The hostess was friendly. But the server was extremely rude. We were very disappointed. Though the food was good, I would never come to this place ever again."}
{"text":"While visiting the Science Center for a Yelp event, my family and I wanted to find somewhere within walking distance with decent reviews. Lo and behold, we found this wonderful Vietnamese restaurant. The entrance was a little difficult to find, but it was well worth the hunt!  The beef pho was phenomenal, and they gave plenty of meat, noodles, and broth. The fried rice was crisp, flavorful, and delicious to eat. Sharing between 4 people, we only spent $40 and we were all completely stuffed upon completion of the meal.   I definitely recommend the experience, since the atmosphere is very vibrant and welcoming!"}
{"text":"The good: Bright and clean dining area, really fast service, very generous portions, open later than other restaurants around the area. My husband liked his ramen noodles with chicken.  The not so good: My vegetarian pho was very bland, I had to add massive amounts of Sriracha and soy sauce to give it any flavor at all. The tofu was spongy and chewier than I'm used to, not terrible, but not great. I also ordered the tofu garden rolls. The rice wrapper was really chewy, not easy to bite through, and the peanut sauce was lackluster, also had to add soy sauce to thin it out a bit and add some flavor.  It's an ok place to go if you want food that is served quickly, is relatively inexpensive, and don't mind adding soy or Sriracha to flavor your order."}
{"text":"The vegetarian pho was not anywhere near authentic, sadly. Tasted like a vegetable soup, not like pho."}
{"text":"Very, very good Pho. 4 stars because the service has been a little slow on the days I've visited. The beef broth is one of the best in town, and the beef round is sliced perfectly thin and arrives medium rare. Give Pho Thang a try, just be patient and not in a big hurry when you go."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into Pho Thang Cafe you immediately smell the aroma of good old fashion family cooking.  I was in town for a conference a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of dining in this place. Lunch is a bit busy but the food comes out exceptionally fast for a downtown lunch rush especially at the bar. The waitress behind the bar was very friendly. She knew customers and their orders of people sitting close to me. I was very impressed. The menu was quite impressive. The waitress then recommended the spicy beef noodle soup (B14). She then explained that it wasn't terribly spicy that it was strong in lemongrass which I love. She proceeded to give me this metal container with their restaurant home made hot oil. And it was hot. I was warned not to use too much. By the time I was done eating and got my bill I was stuffed and had to have the food packed up! The bowl was that large! And for basically $12 (without tipping) there was no other good feeling. I recommend pho thang cafe highly and will be returning once again."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant. The service is always fast and they have a dish (b13 -house special vermicelli) that I CRAVE. They have very good flavors and everyone I take there is always impressed."}
{"text":"So, finding your way into this place is quite the experience LOL Do not follow GPS....I REPEAT: DO NOT FOLLOW GPS. It will take you to the hotel side and that is not the entrance. But hey, the extra exercise will give you the calorie burn you will need for a nice, huge bowl of Pho!  And yes, their bowls of Pho are H-U-G-E! You know when I spell something out, I mean business. They load it with noodles and meat. How one person can finish a bowl on their own is absolutely beyond me! But, as seen by the humans around us finishing them, it is possible. We split ours and man am I glad we did. The broth was SCRUMPTIOUS. I love the simplicity of the flavors. The meat was cooked perfectly....no tough beef here folks!   Next, was the deluxe fried rice. Hot damn, that stuff really is deluxe. It was so flavorful and the rice was cooked perfectly. If this fried rice were single and a human....I would marry it. Throw on that sweet and tangy sauce they give you and yes.....foodasm baby!  I cannot say enough good things about the pork cabbage salad. We weren't sure about this when we initially ordered it, but lemme tell you something.....and it is a secret so come close. Closer.....closer......THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MEAL. Ok, so I yelled it....not much of a secret anymore. It was crunchy and yummy and had tons of cilantro flavor. I can still taste it!   The only complaint I have (and it is more of a suggestion I guess) is that the servers need to communicate about who is taking care of whom. We must have had 4 servers approach us and all were asking the same things. We could have placed our order 4 different times LOL But, they were all super nice....so we let it slide!  WE WILL BE BACK PHO THANG! PHO SHO!s"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  The food is fantastic and the staff is the nicest around.    Although it's fairly new I've been there a few times already, eating in and also taking out, and it's always a superb experience."}
{"text":"I have tried another two Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland before I settled on this restaurant and I have been here for three times.  The char-grilled pork sandwich is a must.  The meat was very juicy, was neither over-marinated nor over-cooked, mixed very well with the pickles, jalapenos, cucumber, and cilantro.  The spicy beef noodle soup is a specialty, not easily to be found in other Vietnamese restaurants. The rod-size noodles are more elastic than the noodles in the normal pho. The soup was not over-salty and the portion matched with the amount of meat, which included ham, beef, pork, and pork trotters (!)."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a frigid day, hoping to get warmed up from a bowl of pho. The place was pretty busy when we got there around 12:30pm but we were able to get a table for 11.  The service was good but the food could have been better. We may be biased as we are used to Pho 75's delicious pho but the noodles were too soft despite the broth being decent. I can't speak for the spring rolls personally but was informed by one of us in the party that they were disappointing as well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was super fresh and delicious. I got the lemongrass and chili beef and loved it. The beef was tender and packed with flavor. It came with some soup I have never had that had scallions, cilantro and bacon in it and I was so sad when the bowl was empty, best damn soup ever. My friend had the bahn mi and she loved it. I am visiting from out of town and I wish this place was in Madison, WI because I would be there every week."}
{"text":"Pho Tang is really good. Fresh food. And they make it quick! Its also reasonablly priced. 1 appetizer and 2 entrees was $24. And you get a lot of food. The mango smoothies are the best too."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic. I had the spicy beef soup and the sandwich and couldn't finish because I was stuffed. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food tastes good and is nice and hot. I have been here about 5 times and the service has been good. They check on your food and re-fill your water.   Today, Sunday April 16, I experienced the worst service there. My male waiter sat me next to a noisy couple when there were plenty of other seats available. He did not check on my food, gave me my food late, and did not re-fill my water. However, this male waiter checked on the other couple's food, offered to refill their water twice, and gave them their food before me (I ordered a few minutes before the couple). The restaurant closes at 7 PM on Sunday and I saw him turn away a party of 3 at 6:30 PM. There were no signs that they were closing early. I do not support this type of service discrimination. I won't be returning. I was planning to come here about once a week, but not anymore. You lost me as a customer.  Note that the female waiters are much better. They provide great service."}
{"text":"This was the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, hands down! I came here for the first time yesterday with my fiancé and my family and we all enjoyed our meals very much.   We ordered a variety of menu items. We started off with 2 different bahn mi sandwiches. The bread was tasty and perfectly toasted and the toppings were flavorful. Three of us ordered Pho, one ordered chicken cabbage salad, and I ordered the spicy beef soup. I liked my dish best, it was so good! It came with a side dish of bean sprouts, basil and cabbage. I enjoyed all the veggies and herbs. Another great thing in my mind is that the hot soups were served in a ceramic bowl. I don't like eating out of plastic, especially hot food, so this was a big plus in my book.   The prices were right, around $8-$11. Service was very friendly and good.   I would highly recommend this place. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more from this restaurant. The waiter here was really quiet. The plates (all of them) had no flavor. The meat was so plain even with the sauce. The fried rice was the worst fried rice in the history of fried rice. The Thai Tea was very overpriced. It was 70% ice, 30% tea, that's worse than Starbucks' ratio. We only came here because there was nothing else opened on a Sunday. So this should be your last resort."}
{"text":"The house special beef pho was great, with plenty of beef. But the real highlight for me was the banh mi - every bite was perfection. Reasonable prices too, especially for such great food!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but service was super super bad.  The waiter didn't even serve us water throughout the entire time we were there even after requesting it. I really don't appreciate the waiter giving us a poker face and turned around without letting us know whether he understand what we request for......the 1 star was given to their pricing (relatively cheaper compare to other places in downtown Cleveland) and food quality. But overall don't recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Very untraditional location, in the reserve bank building located in downtown Cleveland. At first you wouldn't know what to expect, but this place pleasantly surprised me. The Pho was legit, compared to superior Pho and bowl of Pho. The meat in the pho is grilled to perfection, seasoned well and serving size is huge! I got the pork bun and loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I had the pho with brisket. It was huge, hot and tasty. Not too salty and done very well. It comes out quick and ready to eat. Its a bit hard to find but once inside the place is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"We popped into this restaurant on a very cold day in Cleveland after going to a convention, where the food is awful.  It was nice and toasty on the inside. The service was prompt and efficient.  I had the vegetarian spring rolls.  My husband enjoyed his noodles.  I've been down this street several times before, but never knew this place existed.  Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy this kind of cuisine and are looking for a quick meal in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Very typical restaurant in Cleveland, highly rates on yelp but subpar food. Ordered the chicken spring roll which was actually not bad, the chicken was well marinated but very thin slices, mostly stuffed with noodles and lettuce. Very typical of a cheap establishment but it was edible. My entree was the chicken fried rice which was tasteless. You could tell by the way the chicken look that they did marinate or stir fry the chicken in anything as it looked completely white and was tasteless. Dont expect anything with taste here since its really hard to screw up fried rice."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review ever, but I must write about Pho Thang Cafe because of our experience there last night.  First of all, the service was top notch.  Secondly, the food was fantastic....so much so that we ordered another meal just to take home and eat the next day.  The owners even went out of their way to help drive me over to my car at the end of the night when it was snowing/hailing outside.  Go for the food and go back again for the great service.  Thank you Pho Thang Cafe for treating me and my family like long-time friends!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night as part of a dinner \"party\" of sorts. It was a set dinner, so it was not directly off the menu, but it is reflective of what they serve.   We started with appetizers - spring rolls, Vietnamese egg rolls, a chicken/cabbage salad. The peanut sauce was too salty for me, but the rest of the dipping sauces were great! The fish sauce was hardly salty and the sweet-chili sauce was not spicy. My favorite part of the appetizer (surprisingly!) was the salad. Everything was tasty, though.  The second course was Pho - made with real bones! You can taste the difference. It's rich, but not overwhelming. The meat was tender and flavorful.  Our entree was a mix - fried rice, ramen noodle stirfry, pan friend pork, roasted shrimp, pickled carrots/radish. Again, everything was excellent - lots of vegetables and flavorful dishes. My favorite of all of these items was the pork. I am not sure what seasoning they use, but it's likely one of the best pieces of pork I've ever had. It's thin and yet, still tender.   For dessert, we had a sweet sticky rice pudding, mixed with black-eyed peas and topped with coconut milk. I really like rice pudding in general, but this was slightly different. The beans gave it a thicker consistency, but didn't change the flavor much. The coconut on top was a delightful addition!   The worst part about this place is getting there. The address is Superior, but the entrance is out \"back\" on Rockwell, which is a one-way street and a nightmare to get down in rush hour traffic. There are two parking garages across from the Rockwell entrance, but they are kind of expensive, so try for street parking a block away, if you have the patience."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. Its sad that it is not something you would just pass and stop in, you really have to know its there. I had the beef ramen, which was generous, pretty tasty, could have used some more seasoning for my personal liking, but that may not be everyone's preference. My significant other had Bun, and he enjoyed it, but again, under-seasoned. The spring rolls were really good, as was the thai tea. You can make the thai tea a bubble tea by request. Overall, I would say probably one of the better places in the area, but maybe not as good as #1 pho or superior pho as far as overall flavor. I recommend trying it. Will certainly be back to try the pho and the rice dishes as well."}
{"text":"Let's talk location first. The Main entry is actually on Rockwell Ave just west of E 9th. Can't imagine what to do for parking Monday thru Friday in the day time, except for a paying for parking in the garage close by.  That is why I picked  a early Saturday evening, with not much going on downtown for this visit.  I park on Rockwell Ave just east of E9th, just a close walk away. For those who work downtown, close by this is a good location for you verse getting in your car to drive to the other Pho restaurants  nearby  on Superior Ave. http://goo.gl/maps/qlfgQ Now about the \"Pho\", my reason for trying Pho Thang Cafe, the tasty aromatic noodle soup I look for and crave. The House special beef noodle Pho had plenty of meat, more than other Pho restaurants in the downtown  Pho Triangle area, the broth had that intoxicating rich aroma I look for in a good bowl of Pho.  The chicken Pho was good but with only a small amount of meat in the bowl, but it had a equally  flavorful aromatic chicken broth that somewhat made up for it. Each large bowl was served with a individual side of some traditional garnishes of bean sports, Thai basil, jalapeño and a wedge of lime. The rice noodles where a good quality, nicely cooked and did not clumped together.  All the ingredients  were nicely and thoughtfully placed in the bowl and served hot. We also tried the Grilled Pork Banh Mi, the  pork was nicely cooked , still juicy  with a nice char grill flavor, served in a nice airy French roll, garnished  with crisp pickled carrots & dikon radish and sliced jalapeño.    The restaurant  is large and noticeable clean inside, with a large bar as you enter, but with No Liquor license at this time. The service was fast and efficient.  I definitely will be back. Worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere, good service and great food. We enjoyed several items from the menu for lunch! Fresh, hot and flavorful!"}
{"text":"It is as good as everybody raves about. So, after our Visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame museum we were looking for something warm to eat, Pho immediately comes to mind . Yelp'd a spot an Pho Tang came up, so we promptly drove to it (Yeah, only 0.5 miles away, but with 0 degrees out and wind shield in the negatives, we drove) Sat, ordered and food came to us rather fast. My pho was amazing, tasty and filling. Banh mi was very good as well. Overall, I'll definetly go again if i'm in the area. Give it a try for sure."}
{"text":"This is me and my boyfriend's go-to pho place in Cleveland (better than Superior Pho)! Really great broth and it comes out very quickly. It can be difficult to find the entrance though. Keep walking northwest on E 9th and make a left on Rockwell; it'll be on your left."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper recently posted some pictures of their food from this place and I was like \"hmm yeah, I could use some pho\", so I made a trip downtown to check this place out! It was a holiday afternoon so there was not much traffic so I was able to snag a free parking spot on the street. Just take note that the entrance is on Rockwell not Superior. Inside I was greeted by a friendly bartender who helped me with finding good things to eat off the menu. I went with:  A1. - Bahn Mi $4.95: Very tasty! I took one bite and couldn't stop eating it! B13. - House Special Vermicelli $10.95: Kind of like a cold pasta salad with a lite dressing. A-Okay and enough for two meals.  M4./M7. - Egg noodle and clear noodle soup $10.95: Huge portion and enough for two meals, but sadly the shrimp balls had a funky taste that I did not enjoy.   Overall I'd check this place out again as I really liked the Bahn Mi and I am sure if I explored the menu a little more I'd find other tasty items."}
{"text":"Found through yelp during morning trip through Cleveland. Excellent food. Server was outstanding. Very conscientious. Recommend."}
{"text":"Good, fast food. Generous servings. Good Pho and vermicelli dishes. It's what you'd expect from a standard Vietnamese restaurant and is clean with attentive service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the rude and disrespectful treatment we received by our waiter was offensive. He ruined our experience and it was a complete turn-off to Pho Thang Cafe. To have this negative attitude displayed to us by another POC was disheartening!"}
{"text":"Great pho, cabbage salad and spring rolls. Everything I've ever had has been perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  I want to love this place, however, my favorite Pho restaurant is still Superior Pho.  The portions are very small here, particularly the meat in all the dishes we tried.  Tried the Pho, spring rolls, chicken cabbage salad and all were good, but  very, skimpy in size for the same price that you pay at similar restaurants in the area.  The one entree to NOT try is the beef ramen.  Disgusting, it was like eating the cheap ramen noodles from the package that you can buy anywhere.  I compared it to Wonton Gourmet's wonton noodle soup, in which they use ramen noodles but are so much better.  We most likely won't go back as there are too many other places to eat in the downtown/Payne avenue area that are much better.  Superior Pho, Wonton Gourmet and Siam Cafe are the top 3 and have been for many years for a reason!"}
{"text":"Having lived in San Francisco for many years and been spoiled by the endlessly fascinating Slanted Door Vietnamese Cuisine as well as many smaller Vietnamese restaurants in the Bay Area, Pho Thang Cafe is simply the best Vietnamese one can experience now in Cleveland.  With Pho Ha Nam in the Asia Town Center a close second, these two authentic Vietnamese restaurants are now far better than either the long established Superior Pho or downtown's Saigon. Bac in Tremont is a close third, but it can be a bit too Americanized in some of its offerings. Pho Thang Cafe has the best Bahn Mi in Cleveland - hands down.  And its tasteful Fresh Garden Rolls are actually that - fresh, delicious and plentiful! Combined with an excellent balanced Peanut/Hoisin Sauce, these rolls are easily the best in Cleveland! (Pho Ha Nam is a very close second! Theirs are a bit smaller size.) The Pho soups are fragrant, balanced, and tasty. And again, more than adequate portions. The staff is friendly and professional and the overall restaurant is clean and well lit. If you want to experience what folks get to eat on a daily basis in foodie/gourmet capital of America San Francisco, then you must go to Pho Thang Cafe. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I met my husband here for lunch this past week after seeing so many great yelp reviews. Service was very fast and very friendly. Most importantly of course, the food was great. We got the spicy beef soup and one of the pho bowls (can't remember which one specifically), plus a bahn mi. The broth, the noodles, the add ins were all on point with the soups. This place really gives superior pho a run for its money. Differences: pho thang is bigger, closer to downtown, and a bit more expensive if I recall correctly. Either way, it's great to have another really delicious pho option in town."}
{"text":"Good find!"}
{"text":"So so so good! Their spring rolls are top notch,  &  hand rolled daily (I asked) .  I will absolutely be making MANY return visits.  The pho and bahn mi, and ramen are all fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here with my girlfriend during her hour break from work. The food was quite good, and everything came out as expected and reasonably expeditiously. The service wasn't bad, per se, but it was, well, a bit awkward. There was only one guy waiting on the entire restaurant. We weren't even sure at first that there was ANYONE waiting on customers when we walked in because this man was wearing a hoodie and looked like just a normal guy. Granted, this was at 6:30 PM, and he was more than enough manpower to cover the 2 tables and the 3 people at the bar, but it just felt weird to be in this fairly nice restaurant setting, being waited on by a plainclothes civilian.  But I'd still go back. No denying the food was good."}
{"text":"Delicious char broil pork rolls and some yummy noodle dish. The shrimp spring roll was decent but not great. All in all - thanks Yelp.  Out of towners - happy!"}
{"text":"i had my first banh mi (sp?) here - a vietnamese sandwich with meat and vegetables. it was delicious. their rolls are large, fresh and yummy too. what i appreciated most was their hospitality - they created a long table for our large party as more and more people came. they were great taking our orders, splitting all our checks, and singing & dancing to happy birthday for our friend."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for a while.  Stopped in on a Saturday when I was in the area for something else.  Overall the place was nice. The food was good.  I ordered a Vegetarian Pho.  It was served with fried tofu.  Can't complain about anything but can't rave either.  Other Pho restaurants serve a homemade style spice tray, which was not available here.  Staff was very friendly and answered all requests.  The restaurant itself is very clean and well maintained"}
{"text":"this place is awesome food is amazing they have these  crispy spring rolls that are to die for so consistent the thinist possible wrapper fried when u bite into this thing it's so meaty and decident you actually experince the inside perfection with out all just wrapper  u know like when u get a shity chicken finger that's all breading lol"}
{"text":"I came here to satisfy a Banh Mi craving after the place I normally go to for that sort of thing ran out of the sandwich...awkward. I had never been here so I figured why not?  First things first - I got the sandwich to go and it was delicious. What sets this place apart from other Vietnamese restaurants around in regards to the Banh Mi is that they offer three kinds. I got the Banh Mi Thit Nuong (my favorite one) and it had everything a Banh Mi Thit Nuong sandwich should have. The pork was grilled but not tough and you could taste the marinade. The picked onions and carrots had a lovely flavor that you could taste and mixed well with the pork, the jalapenos, the cilantro and the pate/sauce. The bread was also perfect. To top it all off it was $4.95. You can't beat that.   The downside is that because of its location, you have to find parking at a meter if you're driving in. Then again if you work in the area you don't have that issue and I definitely urge you to stop by! There's an entrance off of Rockwell that's into the restaurant itself or an entrance off of Superior but you have to walk through the hallway of the building a bit. The interior is suprisingly massive and their menu appears extensive.  I'm definitely going to stop by here and try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 items off the menu. we had the grilled pork bah mi, round eye & flank pho, chicken noodle(dark meat), and ramen stir fry pork.  Everything was good,  however they could definitely have skimmed off a lot of the oil that was in my pho.  The porkin the ramen and the meat in my pho were a little pink to my liking but other then that it was good.  Parking is kinda nuts as there is no close parking."}
{"text":"Looked around for a while to settle on lunch, I finally set my eyes upon a name. Pho Thang Cafe, it was called. I had seen many Chinese places at the food court at Tower City Center, but first time I had seen a Vietnamese restaurant. I went into the cafe at afternoon and only a family was there. It was big but very empty. It was expected, however, since the streets were filled with less people than any places. The receptionist was good and she asked me where I wanted to be seated, the bar or a table. I was led to the bar and I ordered the Summer Rolls and House Special Egg Noodle Soup. Both of them tasted deliciously. The broth was very good too. I would recommend coming here again in the future if I ever come back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"In town overnight, walked a couple blocks to Pho Thang. Started with soft rice paper summer rolls. Packed with shrimp, sprouts, and fresh mint with the usual peanut based sauce. Delish! My number 1 Pho's broth was redolent with charred ginger, 5 spice, and beef flavor. Packed with thin sliced beef flank, rice noodles, and the usual side of fresh basil, sprouts, lime, and chilis. A very generous serving. My lady had the vermicelli noodles,chicken, peppers, onions in a light curry. Just the right amount of curry flavor that allowed the flavors of the vegs and chicken to shine through. Great Lakes IPA went great with our meal. Service a bit spotty though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...hovering towards 4?  The food here is solid, and the service even better! This family owned place is very warm and welcoming, and it's always great to support local businesses to help stimulate CLE's economy. I think the only thing I didn't like about the place was the parking situation. We had to search for street parking, which can be a bit of a pain. It's probably easier to find open parking spots in the evening, so I suggest trying this place later on in the day. On to the food...I tried the bun bo hue, while my friends tried the pho and pork sandwich. The bun bo hue here had pig feet (wow), and other yummy fixings like beef shank, onions, cilantro, lime, herbs, and of course vermicelli noodles. The broth was rich and had decent flavors. I also tried my friend's pho, which she seemed to enjoy. The food here was good, but I think the broths were a tad bit sweet for my taste. I guess I prefer more savory flavors, personally. I would definitely try this place again though! It's great to see more pho places in CLE, and taste each restaurant's special broth."}
{"text":"Charbroiled pork rolls and spicy beef noodle soup, with Vietnamese iced coffee.  Delicious food."}
{"text":"Pho Sho !!!  Had a quick lunch here after exploring the Cleveland highlights. Flavorful broth with lots of good ingredients"}
{"text":"I'm a big pho aficionado and was down to determine the best pho in Cleveland, OH. After eating at numerous vietnamese pho restaurants in Cleveland, I have come to the conclusion that Pho Thang is the best. The soup tastes substantially better than a certain pho restaurant on Superior. The spring rolls are girthy and substantial, definitely worth trying. However, it's a bit pricier than the alternative pho restaurants in cleveland, a bowl of Dac Biet is $12 at the time of this post as opposed to $10 at a certain overrated pho restaurant down by superior.   Coming from Boston where we have a huge Vietnamese community, the pho at this restaurant ranks the same as some of the pho restaurants here in Boston. I'm impressed that Ohio can produce pho of this caliber."}
{"text":"Pho is the way to go... excellent!  Bánh Mì could be great, but the choice of bread holds it back."}
{"text":"While in town for business/pleasure, some friends recommended this place for Pho. Pretty authentic, they were very clean and professional. Don't expect SoCal style with the cheap price and over stuffed bowls, the Pho here is neat and the portion is just right. Great place for business meetings, get together, date, and family. I couldn't believe they accommodated my SoCal request habit for: serving ribeye slices seperately, vinegar onions, and a separate bowl of scallion stems in broth. We stayed half past closing time on a Sunday night, and the owners waited for us without a mention of closing!"}
{"text":"There are times when one just wants to curl up in fetal position, in pajamas, parked in front of a tv on a cold and blustery day.  But then you realize \"Oh, wait it's Monday and I have to work on this crappy day.\"  Once 12:00 PM hits, I know that my crappy day is going to get slightly better because of Pho Thang. Minh Anh is still my favorite place to go for Pho, however Pho Thang is right across the street from the building I work at.  I could go to Saigon, which is also walking distance from me, but I think Pho Thang's Pho is much better and cheaper, especially if you get their combos. I always get carry out, which might be best if you do not have a lot of time for lunch.  Sometimes, the service is a little slow during lunch rush, but that is expected. I will always go to Pho Thang for my Pho when I am at work and want that cozy feeling of being curled up on a couch with my pajamas."}
{"text":"Maaaaan...I fux with these sammiches. Pho is solid, but dude...these sammiches are BANANAS.   4 of 5 stars. WOULD repeat."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the unassuming storefront, the inside is bright and spacious. Although my #1 Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland is still reserved for Superior Pho, Pho Thang Cafe is the best Vietnamese food you can find downtown. Lunch hour is busy but not as crowded as Saigon on East 4th. Great addition to the downtown Asian dining scene."}
{"text":"Pho Thang Cafe is just a few blocks away from the Marriott Key Center where I was staying - I was craving some Pho Ga - and the reviews for Pho Thang Cafe looked promising!  It was a very cold and windy day out. Normally one could walk down here from the hotel - but with the wind chill - I opted to drive. There is a pay parking garage on Rockwell Street - named the \"Rockwell Parking Garage.\" It's right across the street from Pho Thang Cafe.  The place is huge on the inside - lots of seating. I opted to sit at a table. I ordered the Goi Cuon (Fresh Garden Rolls - with shrimp, pork, and herbs) - served with a side of peanut sauce, and a bowl of Pho Ga (white meat).  I asked that the Garden Rolls come out first - and to not bring the Pho Ga until I was done with the Garden Rolls. My server agreed to this - but then brought the Pho Ga out before I was done. Will have to work on the communications next time I am in...  The Pho Ga chicken broth was very tasty. The plate of aromatics was fresh and in fine fettle. I added everything to the bowl: Basil, fresh squeezed lime, bean sprouts, and jalapeños. Chicken was tender, noodles were not all clumped up. I added a lot of Sriracha sauce to individual bites and then to the broth. I destroyed the entire bowl - it was really good. I think it's the current title holder for best Pho Ga in the Cleveland area.  Service was good - other than the timing issue. I will be back here again for more Pho Ga!  #PhoThangCafe #PhoGa"}
{"text":"2 stars is more of a stretch really.  I don't mean to put down others' reviews, but as a Vietnamese myself who often eat traditional Vietnamese cuisine, this place was not good at all.  My Vietnamese friend and I wanted to try this place out.  Oh wow, no one wanted to serve us when we came in, we waited and a guy came out, said nothing.  Threw us the menu onto table, took our orders and again, said nothing.  He seemed almost snobby.  Onto the food, now I haven't tried their other dishes so I'm only giving my opinion on the Pho.  Pho was not good at all, broth was bland and nothing even subpar.  It more of a quick throw everything in the pot using semi-artificial beef broth flavors.  No, for real, because sometimes we former college students had to do so.  I'm not sure how there are so many great reviews on here but Pho was not something I would come back for.  Superior Pho is definitely the better one in the Cleveland area, but even it is not the best there is.  Superior Pho compared to other Pho places for example in Columbus, is far below."}
{"text":"Chicken pho and grilled pork sandwich were very good.  Service was great.  This Will be our new pho spot"}
{"text":"I was unfortunately underwhelmed with this place.  I heard from many people and limitless Yelp reviews about the quality of this place, so I decided to check it out one weekend.   I ordered the chicken ramen, automatically thinking it would be a bowl of steaming broth with ramen and chicken, but I was mistaken. Maybe I should have read the menu better. They brought out a plate of just noodles and chicken with stir fry veggies. The noodles lacked flavor and seemed a bit dry. The chicken was decent, and the veggies were okay, but overall, I wasn't pleased with my dish.   I haven't wanted to go back to this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish: Maybe I need to give this place another try due to all the reviews. I've had better Vietnamese, and plan on visiting them before I hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Love this spot for lunch. Great Vietnamese food. Crispy spring rolls are the best I have had. Lemongrass chicken, stir fried vermicelli noodles (Singapore style), combination plate with grilled pork and shrimp and pho are my favorites. Staff is friendly and efficient. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Park on Rockwell near the corner of Rockwell and E. 9th St.  Enter through the door on Rockwell.  Street parking is free on weekends.  The pho scene in Cleveland is extremely competitive, but I would say that Pho Thang stands up to the competition, and is one of the better places.  As for the pho - the broth is perfect, not too oily; the noodles are cooked well, the meat is a little tough; could be better.  The vermicelli was cooked well and had enough flavor for my taste.  Both seemed pretty authentic to me.  Looks like we have a new good pho option downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend two weeks ago, and we both loved it! The service was great, food was delish and it wasn't crowded at all. The chicken cabbage salad was my FAVORITE! It was a little on the pricey side, for Vietnamese, but you definitely get what you pay for in this case. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a really great meal here the other day. Was in Cleveland for a conference and needed something to eat after I checked into my hotel. Went to this place and saw a table full of police officers eating so I knew it must be good. I had the spring rolls which were tasty but a little bit oily. Also had the spicy bun bo hue which was really delicious and filling. Prices were reasonable and the lady working the counter was super nice. Toward the halfway point of my meal the owner came out and asked me if I would like to watch football and he turned on the tv for me. Thought that was really nice of him. Go give it a try if your ever in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went in just after they opened and the staff was very nice and willing to offer suggestions. Got the Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) to go and it was extremely good. Love all the toppings that come with it and they put them all on the side so they remained fresh. I would love to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Pho Thang is a low-key, well-hidden lunch oasis easily overshadowed by the profusion of flashier main street establishments which comprise the Gateway District. Service is split second fast, making your intrepid reviewer a tad curious if the titular pho is kept heated all day long, instead of being carefully made to order. Said pho, particularly of the vegetarian variety (which needs to be ordered off-menu as a substitution), is not what one might call an overwhelmingly robust affair--consisting chiefly of sponge-chewy tofu chunks almost too large to dispatch in one bite (though admittedly their porous nature is superb for sauce absorption), a few scant carrots/peppers, a nest of noodles, and broth so unseasoned as to require implementation of every condiment from the basket provided to each diner as a matter of course. Perhaps the meat stock pho packs more of a favorable punch, though this cannot be verified. The decidedly lackluster pho is bolstered however by exquisite spring rolls, which are wicked crunchy and super hot. Service, it should also be noted, is uniformly excellent. Servers are keen to remember patrons' names, and their dispositions are nothing if not sunny, their personalities outsize. You'll feel right at home here amid the colorful décor, but if you're a vegetarian, plan a trip to the cardiologist in advance because you're definitely going to be going heavy on the soy sauce."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service!  Was a perfect place to go after a matinee at Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"So while walking home from our failure to find a place to eat I noticed this place. Got back to our hotel and I decided to try and thank goodness! This place is awesome! I have finally found a place worth a five star review!  Ordered Chicken Ramen Noodles and yum! I wanted to try a smoothie but it was a late night meal! I might have to eat this again before leaving!! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was downtown Cleveland over a weekend and decided to come here on an overcast day. Really glad I came here. Downtown Cleveland is pretty dead on the weekend, and I was the only person here.   That being said I sat at the bar and had some delicious hot/spicy pho.  I got the dark meat chicken and it was great.  I wanted to order more food but was stuffed with a big bowl of pho.  I would imagine this place is a bit more crowded during the week at lunch,"}
{"text":"Less expensive and more authentic than its downtown rival, this is a great spot for lunch. Their bahn mi is a positive bargain, and comes in three varieties. Pho is very good, and can be had with all the traditional cuts, including tendon and tripe. I could be wrong, but I think the place is family run - it definitely feels like it. Housed in a somewhat hastily converted cheesy nightclub (complete with a sparkly orange bar top), the decor isn't going to win any awards, but the food just might."}
{"text":"Yum! The combination meals on the last page of the menu are such a good deal! I came here for lunch one Saturday and got a big bowl of pho, a spring roll, and a drink for less than $11.  The broth of their pho is really really tasty. If I had to guess, I would say they must cook the broth for several hours to get the flavor that rich and savory. They also give you a very healthy serving of meat. I ordered the meatballs, and the meatballs are so large that they cut them into \"discs\". The spring rolls are also pretty large, and if you order the hot jasmine tea they will bring out an entire pot for you to enjoy. This was a perfect meal, especially on a cold snowy day. If there's one good thing about Cleveland winters, it's that they make a hot bowl of pho all the more satisfying.  Great service - other than the fact that when we first walked in the door, no employees were to be seen and we didn't get seated for a few minutes. We looked around and started browsing the menu while we waited. Once our hostess/waitress showed up, she tended to our every need and seemed to do a good job with all the other tables that came in too. Very friendly and even helped box up my boyfriend's leftover pho (I ate all of mine so no leftovers ;-). Some of the other patrons seemed to be regulars at this place - and I can see why!!"}
{"text":"Came here for work lunch, service was slow but may be because we sat in the front near the door on the other side of the bar than the main dining room. Saw lots of people coming in to pick up takeout orders. Separate vegetarian section to the menu with about 8-10 options. I ordered the Ramen and was expecting a little something closer to Pho, but even sans broth the noodles and broccoli were yummy! Oh, and main entrance is off of Rockwell."}
{"text":"Deeeeelish! Came here with my boyfriend and his brother and we all really enjoyed what we got... plus two appetizers and 3 entrees was around $40... WIN. Plus the people working there were all very nice. It's a great little semi-hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The end result after eating here --- a whole table full of food left uneaten except for my husband's beef pho bowl.  That was probably the only pro.  I left feeling like that was one of  the worst $50 spent on food ever.  Food:  I ordered the chicken fried rice for my toddler.  It looked like white rice thrown together with bean sprouts and a pinch of soy sauce and tasted like it as well.  Needless to say, my 2-year-old didn't like it.  My husband or I will usually finish his food but we both didn't like it either so we left it almost full sitting on the table.  I ordered the chicken pho and it was even worse.  It tasted like warm water, noodles and a pinch of fish sauce --- literally.  I must've tasted it twice and left the entire bowl sitting there as well.  My husband ordered the beef pho and luckily he liked that.  He also ordered thai iced tea and said it tasted too watered down.  Service:  Horrible.  The waiter looked grumpy the entire time we were there, didn't greet us or fill our water or offer help when my son spilled his water.  We felt bad so we got up and cleaned it all up and handed him the piece of paper that functioned as the table cover.  He didn't offer to help or even responded when I told him what happened.  Walked right past us to grab another \"paper\" cover to cover the table.  When we lifted the paper cover to hand to him there was a foul, mold smell.   I quickly realized that under the paper cover was a table cloth with water stains that smelled like old wet towels.  (I will be uploading a picture.  Environment:  Seemed outdated.  It seemed like it was a family business which is super cool, but they had a huge party of \"guests\" that may have been family eating there when we were there as well.  They were talking loudly and were having conversations from across the bar area which eventually made everyone else in the room who were real customers feel like they were uninvited guests at THEIR family party.  Super uncomfortable and unprofessional.  I left feeling extremely disappointed and like we got ripped off.  It was a horrible experience and waste of money.  We ended up stopping at Burger King afterwards --- no joke.  :("}
{"text":"I am from Oklahoma and was visiting Cleveland with my family last week. We stayed at the Hampton Inn that is right next door to the restaurant. I decided to go and eat here by myself (I was craving Asian cuisine which my sister is not so fond of). I was escorted to a table for one and looked over the menu which was quite extensive. Being a vegetarian, I was happy to see a vegetarian section of the menu. I proceeded to order the vegetarian Ramen Noodles and a Thai Iced Tea. The presentation was phenomenal! The portion size was quite large, but a particularly hungry individual could definitely finish the plate (as I did). The vegetables were fresh and the noodles were cooked properly. The tofu was also wonderfully textured and deliciously spongy. The Thai iced tea was refreshing and flavorful. When I walked out of the restaurant I felt completely satisfied and nourished. Great food stop for a tofu craving Oklahoman! :-)"}
{"text":"Entrance is located down a side street just before the Cleveland Federal Reserve truck entrance. While not familiar with Vietnamese, I'm going to go with 100% authentic. Had the garden spring roles and the Bahn Mi roasted pork sandwich with tai iced tea for lunch.  All of it was very tasty, though I could've eaten multiple orders of just the garden spring roles.  Note: Those with nut allergies will have to miss out on the dipping sauce ... and are cursed. Staff very friendly, too."}
{"text":"After a late night event, we wanted something close to the hotel but hearty. I will say that this place can be a bit hard to find because there are two entrances, or so it seems. The Superior Street entrance was closed due to the time of night, but the other (off Rockwell) was luckily open on the other side of the building!   I ordered the crispy egg rolls and the well-done brisket pho. They both tasted exactly like my favorite pho shop back home! The egg rolls were actually crispy and tasty (because pork makes food taste better lol). The broth for the pho was spot on - not too salty, not too sweet, and the right amount of spice. Delicious!  Service was fast. We sat down and were helped within about a minute. Even though the waitress had worked almost a 12-hour shift, she was still pretty chipper and friendly. She wasn't overbearing, checked on us enough (but not too much), and was amiable. I definitely would come here again!"}
{"text":"Yummy convenient and authentic restaurant. Wish they had more vegetarian options but otherwise nice spot"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. Great selection of Summer Rolls and Pho's. Very busy with excellent service. Very affordable as well."}
{"text":"How have I never eaten here before? Bright and clean dining area, quick service and best of all food was delicious. Hubby and I split the fresh garden rolls and the grilled pork bahn mi.  He ordered the house special rice dish and I ordered the house special bun-vermicelli. All were outstanding. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Great flavor in the pho. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"First time at this style restaurant and loved it. Cute spot next to the hotel I stayed at. Food was so good a friend and I ate here two days in a row. Lol!!"}
{"text":"In town for the week and tried this place right next to my hotel downtown.   Phenomenal service, very friendly staff, best egg rolls in town!"}
{"text":"I found myself downtown for jury duty and due to poor planing and disdain for cafeteria food...I found myself in need of lunch.  A friend of mine who works downtown suggested this place.  Please note you can enter into the restaurant directly on Rockwell Ave.  If you enter on Superior you have to walk down the hallway and walk through the red door.  I was short on time and the hunger o meter was high so I quickly order P.10 and a coffee bubble tea.  I am a bit of a bubble tea connoisseur and their tea was good.  Not the best in town but definitely serviceable.  Coffee was a new flavor for me and i loved it.  Tip: If you are new to bubble tea....try the Taro flavor first....its ground zero.  P.10 was Pho with dark meat chicken.  It was pretty much chicken noodle soup.  It was good.  Again not the best Pho in town but definitely great for a quick bite when in a crunch.    Ambiance:  they have the nicest bright orange bar....i mean its absolutely gorgeous.  I would return."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is fast and prices aren't terrible. Ambience is incredibly generic but this isn't for people go for atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Vietnamese food. Everything we ordered  was delicious and very affordable. I had the beef ramen and charbroiled pork rolls. My husband had the B13 and was also very satisfied. We couldn't finish everything on our plates."}
{"text":"5 stars for the awesome pho, spring rolls and noodle dishes!  I came here a few weeks ago for some lunch close to the office. While Pho Thang's Pho can't compete with Superior Pho (which is the best ever, run don't walk), it was about as good as it gets. The broth was awesome and the portion was unreal, like bowl way bigger than my head. I'm going to head back when it's cold out to warm up with this soup! The spring rolls were some of the best spring rolls I have ever had, and my friend's shrimp noodles were enviable as well. Three stars because the service was kind of weird, but a definite three stars because of the prices. For lunch you are going to spend around $10 per dish here and that's without drinks and apps, which is pretty steep. I can't come here every week but this pho will bring me in again!"}
{"text":"This place is has amazing Vietnamese food. I wish I can find a place back home that has the vermicillie beef that tasted like this way. Their veggie eggrolls were delish as well. Customer service was great. I totally recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Took a trip to Cleveland from Chicago and our hotel was right across this place. It's a very lovely restaurant, delicious food, and very reasonable prices. It's family owned and they take care of you and provide exactly what you need.   Make sure to say Hello to Nancy! She is one if the most welcoming people you will run into. We liked it so much that we came here 3 days in a row. Will definitely be the spot to go to when we come back here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Banh mi was awesome- they use the real butter instead of mayo. We had the grilled pork- super yummy.  We had P9- the pho with white chicken. So good!! Love that they do the white meat only version- and it is in chicken broth. A definite go to during the cold winter!  Everything was delicious and service was great. Only sad I didn't have more room to eat more!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Pho. Great service and plenty of food.  We were visiting and happy to find great soup on a very chilly day!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Pho Thang with a friend recently. We were promptly seated and given water. Our orders were taken and our drinks were delivered.  I had tea and my co-worker had soda.  I ordered the P1 bowl with beef with a garden roll.  A short time later, our lunches were delivered. The food was fantastic. In fact, this was the first time I ordered pho here. The broth, veggies, and meat were all delicious. I especially loved my garden roll dipped in peanut sauce. Four stars for the food!  After our food was delivered, our waitress disappeared. She didn't come back to refill our drinks or to give us the check for 40 minutes! They were pretty busy, but that is normal for Pho Thang. They seemed to be short handed. The waitresses would disappear into the kitchen for what seemed like an eternity, and then reappear with dishes of food.  Are the waitresses cooking and serving?  It took about 40 minutes for our waitress to come back with the check. We had finished eating after 15 minutes. The service was lousy. My co-worker went to the bar to ask for the check, but he was snubbed by the bartender. They really need to hire more people and fix their service, but I'm not holding my breath. The waitress ignored the entire dining room, except for bringing food out. Also, we watched people stand at the door waiting to be seated, but they were never seated, so they just left. We also watched the male bartender get into a short verbal altercation with a female waitress. That's professional.  I will not be dining in any longer. If anything, I'll order ahead and take it to go. Get it together, Pho Thang!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Spicy Beef Soup and garden rolls were both fantastic.  Portions are huge. Prices are amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a true treasure of Cleveland's culinary cuisine.  I came here with my boyfriend as a late night dinner.  The waitress ushered him in and found him a seat next to me.  We ordered the beef pho and a chicken with Vietnamese noodle dish.  Both were perfectly seasoned and very flavorful.  The broth just seemed to be completely saturated with flavor.  I have noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants will put in too much salt in order to compensate the flavor of their soup.  That's not the case here, there's just enough seasoning to bring out the real essence of the broth.  Also, the beef was just rare enough to be soft and also add to the delicacy.  The waiters were also prompt with refilling water and packaging our food once we finished.  Even though Vietnamese cuisine isn't very complicated, it does take a bit of mastery to get done right.  This place is definitely on the top of our favorites.  -polite staff -perfect pho -would come again"}
{"text":"I waited a little to write this review. But everytime I come back to the thought of Pho Thang all I can think of is I've had better pho. I love pho and I wanted to like this place but there are definitely better places in cleveland even tho Superior Pho is not the prettiest and this place is newer I prefer the pho there over Pho Thang. There also were little Nats flying around which was a turn off especially when it was winter time. Took a long time to get our check, well after done eating. Just thought it would be better."}
{"text":"Pho Thang Cafe! After hearing about this new spot a couple of weeks after it opened, we made our way downtown to try it out.  It's a little hidden, but I usually can find parking by circling the streets and making sure it's past 6:30pm. But, being a pro at finding parking spots downtown, I didn't think finding parking was that bad.   And as a disclaimer: I'm not Viet, so to be honest, I'm not sure what authentic Viet food should taste like. I mean, I've had the great food in Garden Grove, Vegas, and other highly populated areas with good Viet places....so, in my opinion, I think the food at Pho Thang was great! But yeah, I'm not Viet, so...take my review as it is. I must say though, all my Viet friends that have tried the place do say it is the most authentic they've had in Cleveland....so yeah...  It's a rather large restaurant- a big bar in the middle, a room to the side (for potential karoake! woohoo!) as well as a dining area. We were seated right away, which was nice.  First time I went, I tried B6- the grilled pork vermicelli. It was good- the pork was broiled and marinated very well, good noodles, and fresh ingredients. My wowza dish came with the second time I went though. Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I tried the beef noodle soup - B14. Now, this isn't your Taiwanese beef noodle soup you may be thinking about- it's a spicy beef noodle soup....that can come with pig's feet! Now, I LOVE pig's feet, so I was so surprised when they had mentioned the soup comes with it. I did a double \"what WHAT?\" and when I got the beef noodle soup, I must say- it's GOOD. The broth is sweet and tasty, and the meat and the noodles in it were great. By far, a really great dish.  Each time I've gone, I've ran into lots of friends that I have in the Asian community..which I think, is a good sign you've got a great restaurant. Thumbs up, Pho Thang- I'll be back...... especially for that beef noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Went and tried their raved about spicy noodle soup, the one with the hock/pork leg.  What a let down!!! I wasn't expecting pork leg first of all, so I was very surprised to find 2 fatty hairy pork hocks in my soup. Then I find some random ham? slices that tasted like baloney in texture. Not a fan. The meat here is way too gamey in taste. Even comparing the thinner meat slices to equal ones from Superior Pho, I have to hand it to Superior for having cleaner and nicer meat cuts. Otherwise, the broth was nice and after diluting it with tons of lime, the broth was the most enjoyable part - very limey, just the way I like it. Also, parking is extremely hard to find, yet another reason I will be going back to Superior for my pho cravings."}
{"text":"I love pho. It's conveniently located downtown. They have good food and great prices. I usually get p9 chicken pho and it's about $10."}
{"text":"Another basic pho place- located in the bank of what appears to be a bank on the outside because there are columns. Keep walking down the hallway and you will find it at the end.  Don't get the fried spring roll - it is not the authentic viet ones that come with the dipping sauce and lettuce. Reminds me of spring rolls from Chinese restaurants.   Pho was ok- broth I give it a 3. Meat 3. Overall 3.  Have low expectations if you have had Pho on the east coast esp Philly.  I wouldn't come here unless you were REALLY craving Pho. It's located in downtown Cleveland so you can go to other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! Cheaper than Saigon but taste so better than Saigon! Hard to find though. Their pho and sandwich are the best!"}
{"text":"I'm just updating my review for 2016 - this place is still the best. The B13 house special vermicelli is delicious and is a great lunch for days that your tummy feels like a bottomless pit.   I've gotten pretty dependent on takeout from Pho Thang over the past couple months - I will call in the order as I'm leaving my office and it's always freshly ready when I get there.  All in all, still one of my favorite places downtown!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. I had spicy beef soup, spring and vegetable rolls, but it seemed like we couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu. Also very reasonable price :)"}
{"text":"Went here in the afternoon for lunch in a cold fall windy Cleveland days. Soon as we got there we waited to be seated. There were few people dining in. The server came and sat us. As we looked through the menu there were pictures of some of the meal on the menu. We started with the spring rolls. It took only a few minutes and it came out hot and fresh. The spring rolls were amazing. It was hot and fresh but it wasn't as oily as some spring rolls can be. I ordered beef brisket pho with add of chicken. The pho was  a huge portion. This was my first time having pho as well. The bean sprouts and jalapeño comes on the side and the server gave us hot chili oil to give it a kick. The hot chili oil is perfect combination to add heat to the pho. The pho was very delicious. The broth was really good and flavorful. I didn't need to any other sauce to make it more flavorful. The only reason to add the hot chili oil is to add heat to the pho. Overall I would come back here for the pho and spring rolls and as well as trying more on the menu. The place itself is nice and clean and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken pho and spring rolls. Terrific prices. Super fast delivery. And they deliver to the downtown Westin!!"}
{"text":"Recently checked this spot out for some lunchtime Pho.   I arrived around 11:45 for lunch the other day and it was fairly empty however come 12:15 there had to at least be 50 people dining.  The service was prompt at first, however once the place started to fill we realized they were drastically under staffed.  It took a while to order our food but it did come out very quickly. It also took a great deal of time to get any sort of drink refills, in the hour we were there we only saw our waitress twice, once to order the food and once to refill our waters.    Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the actual Pho....it was bland and flavorless.  Myself and my colleague had to douse our Pho with hoisin, sirracha and jalapeño.  The broth was just like colored water, no complex flavors or rich seasonings or fragrant smells. This statement reflects both the chicken pho and the beef and meatball pho.  The pork summer rolls were also pretty bad as well, the pork was tough and gristly.  The roll maybe had 2 small pieces of pork, the rest was essentially filled with green leaf lettuce, very little noodles and no carrots, radish or herbs.  To say this is my first and last visit would be an understatement. I wish I had saved my money and went and got some good Pho elsewhere."}
{"text":"Recently took a trip to Cleveland for by boyfriends birthday. We stayed at the Hampton Inn above the restaurant, which was intentional so that we could go to Pho Thang Cafe. He absolutely LOVES Pho and couldnt wait to try it out! We went in around 5 and the place was kind of slow. It started to pick up the longer we were there.  I ordered the Ph Gà  (White Meat Chicken Noodle Soup) and the crunchy spring rolls. My boyfriend got the  Ph Tái Nm  (Eye Round Steak and Beef Flank) with the same spring rolls. Our Pho came out shortly there after piping hot in a HUGE bowl (i'm used to having various sizes to choose from haha). The broth was light and packed full of flavor. So much so that i didnt need to add in much else! I still mixed in my usual to make it my own: bean sprouts, fresh herbs, siracha, soy and fresh lime. The spring rolls were also amazing! Fresh made, crispy outer and jam packed with their filling. I could have has a whole meal of just those! The service was quick and very friendly. We definitely look forward to coming back to Pho Thang when we visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"Love this new place. My wife and I found it not to long ago and can't stop thinking about their Pho. The is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland. If you like spicy Pho thy number 14."}
{"text":"Solid joint. I frequent many Vietnamese and Asian restaurants. This place is always consistent in food quality and nice location right by the federal reserve off east 9th near superior. Whether you get Pho or more than just pho you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love \"Orange Counter\". That's what we call it and if you've been there you know why. If you haven't you'll see. Food is excellent. Many healthy options available. Love the chargrilled chicken spring rolls served with peanut sauce. Perfect lite lunch. Have never had a disappointing meal. Staff is friendly and make you feel at home. Some metered street parking between Cathedral and One Cleveland Center across 9th St.  Go check it out."}
{"text":"There wasn't a lot to choose from on this end of downtown but thankfully that is changing, and Pho Thang Cafe is a welcome addition!  Service was super friendly, efficient and plenty fast enough for a one hour lunch break. The food was fresh and delicious, everything my group ordered was great. Can't wait to return and try more. They have quite a large menu. Let's support this great new restaurant!"}
