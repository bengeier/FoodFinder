{"text":"The spot was brand new when visited it so I won't be too harsh with them, many details are being worked out and they showed some real potential for improvement. If you're looking for a good value or authentic Korean, better head downtown or to Chinatown.  If you decide to come to 123 Bulgogi anyway, ask them not to over cook the price and go easy on the sweet sauce on dishes like fried tofu."}
{"text":"Yummy bulgogi and other dishes at a good price! Definitely a good take out option or casual outing. I'm a repeat customer. They've been very nice every time I've gone."}
{"text":"I loveeee 123 bulgogi and their owners are so sweet. I just asked if they might have something on the menu and the next day they tried to put it on their menu. It's fairly priced as well"}
{"text":"We waiting for a long time but they don't say that 'sorry' and also I try to talk to server but they are ignored me. Taste also if you want to try real Korean restaurant, I t is not good"}
{"text":"Finally a korean restaurant near where I live! Was so excited to try it, but was a little disappointed...   Went there around 6pm, there were a few tables. But 30 minutes later, it was almost full house! They were only 2 staff members for the entire restaurant, so it took a bit longer to take our order, but once the order was taken, food came relatively quick.  In terms of food, it was ok. Portions are rather small but enough if you don't eat a lot. Food were served in a \"stone pan\" and it was quite oily.  The ricecake was too soft and the sauce was too liquid. The bibimbap was only good if you add a lot of their sweet and spicy sauce. The bulgogi was salty. For the price of their dishes, quality could improve!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés lors d'une soirée pluvieuse alors que nous cherchions un restaurant désespérément. Je n'ai pas aimé. Le service était lent, la carte mal expliquée et je n'ai pas mangé le tiers de mon assiette. En effet c'était trop et fade."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's not the worst place but it's not the best. The food is good , the one thing I don't like is that the portions are quite small for Korean food considering it's more expensive than most Korean places as well also they don't give kimchi while you're waiting list most Korean restaurants. Id go here if you're in the area or if you're craving Korean food but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Pas époustouflant... commençons par le début, l'entrée est pas très chaleureux, le nom du restaurant ainsi que les heures sont imprimé sur du papier puis tapé au mur, ensuite tu rentre dans ce long espace de salle à manger avec la cuisine ouverte mais il y a aucun décors, mais quand je dis rien c'est vraiment rien, pas de couvert sur les tables, ou de nappe, ou autre, rien !   Ensuite le menu consiste à 4 feuilles de papier format lettre imprimé puis broché ensemble, un peu triste...  On est arrivé vers 14h15 (late lunch), il y avait un seul serveur et un seul cuisinier. Le serveur ne parler pas un mot de français (ce que je trouve un peu triste à Montreal), mais il a bien décrit les plats en anglais. Nous avons pris en entrée des rice cake frits dans une sauce tomate épicé, c'était très bon. Ensuite j'ai pris un Poké bol au tofu et mon copain du poulet bulgogi épicé. Les portions était assez petites, et le bulgogi ne vient avec rien, pas de riz ou de nouilles... et il y avait aucun condiment coréen proposé.  Malgré le fait qu'il soit seul en cuisine et qu'il y ai 4 tables pleines, les plat sont arrivés vite et était bon mais pas extraordinaire.   Au fond je donne trois étoiles car c'était bon mais je pense vraiment qu'ils peuvent faire mieux ! Ils viennent d'ouvrir et la rue Notre-Dame est en travaux, j'irai y refaire un tour dans un ou deux mois."}
{"text":"Great food. Great price. Left very satisfied.  Super flavourful food. I recommend sharing so you can try a bit of a few different dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so excited to finally have a new Korean restaurant right in St. Henri and 123Bulgogi certainly did not disappoint. The staff were welcoming and extremely enthusiastic about helping us decide what were the 'must try' items on the menu. We split a Korean sushi entree to start -- which was comprised of tofu skin and a seasoned sticky rice. For our mains, I ended up choosing a vermicelli bowl with tofu while my boyfriend ordered a lamb dish.  All of the dishes were so fresh and delicious and the staff were all very accommodating to allergies and preferences -- as a vegan with specific food intolerances, this was highly appreciated. In conclusion, 123Bulgogi has definitely become our new go-to Korean spot."}
