{"text":"I love this place for my home parties.  I doubt that I will ever make another meatball because Verdi's meatballs are so good!  The sauce is fantastic also, along with all their other prepared foods.  Another thing that is convenient are their pastry trays that you could buy and have at your house party.  Everything is delicious.  I can't think of 1 item that I did not like that I have sampled so far.  I would recommend going to Verdi's if you have not tried it yet!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful little italian deli!  I'm here at least twice a week to pick up a sandwich to go for lunch or prosciutto for the week.  The service is always friendly and quick even though it gets a little hectic around lunchtime.  The sandwiches are made to order and one of the best things you will ever eat.  Get a muffoletta and a bowl of Italian soup, dine in at a table, and then get some gelato on the way out!"}
{"text":"Really great food here.  I have tried a couple of the subs and so far they have all been amazing!  People are extremely friendly that work here.  Great experience all around, give them a try, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and the people are always friendly and helpful. It is a cute grocery, deli, take out shop. The lasagna is the best around and the subs are absolutely wonderful. The bread is fresh. The meatballs are perfectly seasoned in a delicate tangy tomato sauce. They make this one sandwich with muffuletta, it is really good. Give this place a try if your looking for homemade Italian food at a good price. They just started selling Gelato too."}
{"text":"There are very few establishments in NE Ohio like this one with authentic Italian food that is absolutely delicious!  Some of the sub sandwiches are ridiculously good, so much so that if you go here with another person you must order two different subs and switch halves.  The Wise Guy is the best rendition of a meatball sub I've ever had.  Ghirardelli chocolate brownies are an unexpected success and taste nothing like an ordinary brownie.  Staff and ownership here are very polite, courteous and easy to talk to, which makes your experience all the more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Was in area for event and picked this market because of its excellent reviews.  Well... it did not disappoint.  I ordered sub that was outstanding and the people who worked there could not have been kinder.  Great to find a place with great food and great people. Need to try this place"}
{"text":"With a place like this around I'll pose 1 question or if you prefer a challenge. Why are fast food joints still in business anywhere near this awesome place. I dare you to try it and see if you agree. I have tried many things here for lunch and I would eat them all again but my absolute favorite sandwich is the \"wise guy\" let me know if you agree."}
{"text":"In Mentor making sales calls and found this place using Yelp. Wow! What an amazing selection of sandwiches, salads. Italian dishes of all kinds. I had the Sicilian sub, of which I could only eat half, due to the large portion. I also had their anti-pasta which was absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend this place for a great food that is fresh and has amazing flavor!"}
{"text":"Love this deli.  Great food.  Pizza is delicious.  The bakery and gelato are out of this world.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Thanks Mark for the great customer service today. I called today from California as my sister is ordering a sheet pizza for my nephews surprise 14th bday on Saturday. Thanks again"}
{"text":"MUFFULETTA SUB! These guys make em fresh every day, & they are terrific! As a matter of fact, all their stuff is great. You can eat it there or carry out and have it later! The place does lasagna, eggplant roulettes (which are out of this world), stuffed shells, pizza by the slice & a variety of other subs and pastries. It is a neat little bistro / market, and it is clean as a whistle and the staff is just as nice as they can be.. highly recommend Verdi's. It's a gem."}
{"text":"While I've been in this place before it was just to shop around their Market. This time I went in there specifically with a purpose to order subs and sandwiches for a party. I was not disappointed at all.  Well the parking lot is a little tiny the inside is much bigger than it looks from the outside. They have a Italian Market, a pastry and cookie display case, also place where you can get cold cuts sauces Etc.  We went in to order 16 Subs to pick them up the next day which was no problem at all filling that order for them. We got a mix of muffalata, turkey, roast beef, and Italian cold-cut subs. All the subs came with provolone lettuce and tomato and we chose to put all of these sauces on the side. We weren't going to eat the sandwiches for a little bit we didn't want them to get soggy and that truly was not the case. Our total for 16 Subs which they cut into thirds for us was $79 and if you do the math it comes out to $6 and change per sub. The subs are actually really good and weren't in any way comprable to Major chain places like subway. They were a whole lot better. The bread seemed fresher, the roast beef I found was very lean, even the tomatoes were unusually fresh for this time of year. Even the kids wolf down the subs and they did not last long. You can also get some fresh-made dough at around $2 per ball or less depending on the size. This way you can make your own fresh pizza at home. One of my favorite things to get here is they have Sicilian pizza prepared cut and wrapped which is basically bread sauce and a little Parmesan cheese and it served cold and is a kid I inhaled these and they were just as good as an adult. Great job great people clean store we will be back"}
{"text":"We go in here and it's like we're family. Always pleasant and consistent. I either get the standard cold cut w/ peppers or a \"Sleeps with the fishes\" seafood salad. Always fresh and the bread is delicious. Keep up the good work.  P.s.  My son requested a sub tray from them for his limo bus when getting married. They were thoughtful and took care of everything"}
{"text":"I started working down the street a couple months ago. I was advised by my boss to check it out. Glad I did. As you can tell by the name there is a heavy Italian influence. They have a variety of subs they make while you wait. There are home made pizza rolls (my personal favorite) ready to go when you walk in. There are plenty of treats and pastas galore.  Don't forget to grab a brownie as well.  The price matches the quality and the people behind the counter are super nice."}
{"text":"Been coming to Verdis for years. The food is excellent - an authentic Italian deli. The people are kind and happy (most of them lol), they know me by name and are always eager to help you get what you need. And the price is great for the quality of food and the service you get. An amazing little gem in Mentor."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! I recommend the wiseguy, it is a meatball and capicola sub that will fill you up. The service is very pleasant and for under ten bucks you can a big sandwich, chips and a drink and be full way past time for dinner. I have also tried their pepperoni rolls which are just as good as anything I can make from home and only $2.40.  I have made this place a regular stop for lunch and will keep going back trying new things?on the menu."}
{"text":"I heard that Verdi's had reconfigured the store to offer a room to dine in, so my neighbor and I stopped for lunch.  She ordered a meatball sub, and I ordered an eggplant parmesan sub.  My neighbor liked the tomato sauce as it was light and flavorful. She said she'd come back with her husband.  The eggplant parm was delicious...the way good Italian eggplant parm is supposed to be prepared!  We both liked the rolls the subs came on...light, yet crunchy outside, and soft inside.  When I reheated my leftover half the next day in a 250° toaster oven, it tasted like fresh again!  I had some delicious gelato for dessert, and both my neighbor and I purchased cookies and pepperoni rolls with banana peppers in them to take home.  My husband got to the pepperoni roll before me, and actually texted me at work to say it was great.  I came home and proceeded to polish off what he left.  He was right!  I warmed that at 250° as well.  Perfect!  The cookies?  Oh my gosh!  I think I'll make it easy on myself, and buy my Christmas cookies here this year...and I am picky...only homemade comes from my house!  And I can't leave out mention of the service...excellent.  Even though it is deli style, they insisted that we sit down and relax while they fixed our orders, and served them to us at our table...even the gelato!  By the time we finished, and ordered our to-go items, it felt like we and the staff were family!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times, & always look forward to my visits! I've had a few of their sub sandwiches, & tried bites of others, & they are delicious! Their bread is so fresh & tasty. My boyfriend & I also have taken home pizza dough & pepperoni- one of the best homemade pizzas we've had! It's a family-owned business, so definitely like supporting local. Nice people & good Italian food - can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Ohio!   SUBS ROCK. Seriously the bread is heavenly and the flavors are just awesome. I also really enjoyed the stuffed peppers. AND THE GELATO. It isn't always there.. but when it is... life is happy. I also tried quite a few of the pastries and really enjoyed them. Verdis is a super awesome find and I would definitely recommend it. GO"}
{"text":"Small little shop, but it offers a variety of prepared food/subs and deli. Decent selection of cheese/cured meats and antipasto supplies.   I went here the other day to make up a cheese board. I got a 1/4 lb of parmesan and fontina cheese, as well as some salami, all were delicious. They also had a good selection of olives, which I picked myself, and bread. I definitely recommend their freshly baked bread, so soft and very dense.   Next visit I will try some of their prepared food. They also sell gelato, a variety of Italian cookies and pasta."}
{"text":"Freshly made and great tasting food!  Verdi's Italian Market is easily accessible as it is on the southwest corner of Mentor Ave and Little Mountain Rd and has on-site parking. I was immediately greeted by the staff's warm welcomes, along with, the smells of their delicious food! This is a sit down or to-go restaurant and market. The owners keep Verdi's very clean and organized. Today, I got their Sicilian Sub with hot capicollo, ham, salami, and sopressata, sharp provolone, and roasted red peppers for only $6.50! The Sicilian Sub was very good and is about 10\"-12\" long. I don't even think I waited 5 minutes for it to be made! This sub is a great size to eat half and have a side dish, or eat the whole thing if you're really hungry. I look forward to getting it again along with their other subs, such as their Chicken Parmesan sub. I definitely recommend going here as the food is great, the restaurant is very clean, and the staff is very friendly!"}
