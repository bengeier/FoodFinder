{"text":"This is your typical average chinese restaurant.  Low quality ingredients creating ehh food, but it's not the worst chinese food.  If you're looking for a quick lunch place downtown, they get five stars.  But the Subway next door would be better."}
{"text":"Chinatown Inn is defiantly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. My family had been coming here since it's beginning, the staff is always very friendly and positive. 

My favorite dish is the Spicy War Shew Guy Chicken (No Lettuce) the pieces of chicken are lightly fried and are always juicy, this brown sauce that is on the chicken is the perfect combination of spicy and savory. 

They also have hands down the best shrimp egg rolls in the city. The Szechuan Chicken is also delicious. Take it from a Yinzer, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Chinese place in the city! Hot and sour is good, egg rolls are big, crab rangoons are very good and the fried rice is great. The entrees that I have tried are good as well."}
{"text":"I have been gong there for many years. Always loved it. However the last three times have been a big disappointment. The quality of the food has deteriorated and is totally tasteless."}
{"text":"We were visiting the city...walked into the restaurant at 10:30 on a Friday night and were turned away because the hostess quite obviously wanted to go home soon..very rude and will not be going back..too bad."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. The food was brought out very fast. The food was alright, the egg rolls were better then the meal of general tso."}
{"text":"a decent spot for lunch given that it is pittsburgh.  it's maybe a little step up from your fast food chinese place in nyc, the quality is a little better and the restaurant itself is obviously cleaner.

i started w/the egg flower soup, it was a little on the salty side, but at least seemed like it was all natural eggs and didn't have the weird fake dark yellow color to it that a lot of places have.  tea was on the house which is nice.  i had the eggplant in brown sauce w/white rice.  overall it was decent, eggplant tasted fresh, but this was also a little on the salty side as well.  

i would have given it 2.5 stars if possible, but rounded up since the older waitresses are very nice and reminded me of my mom.  in the end a decent place for a quick cheap lunch (it's slim pickins for good restaurants in pittsburgh)."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat downtown.  Great prices and great food.  However, this last 3 times I have eaten there, the food has been horrible.  The pop and soup both taste like muddy water was used.  The food was below par too.  The brown rice was clumped together and the chicken dint taste good, it was chewy and had a lot of grizzle.  Most likely my last time eating there.  Such a shame because they were really really good."}
{"text":"An excellent lunch spot. Fast pick up, modest prices, BEST crispy eggrolls around. Good atmosphere inside and usually fast service."}
{"text":"The best chinese I have had in Pittsburgh, staff was friendly , it was super speedy like most chinese restaurants but worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start with the bottom line for this place: Awesome. Affordable, delicious, and saucy entrees provide both filling and tasty meals. The beef and broccoli has a liquidy, mouth-watering sauce that is soaked into the broccoli and meat, providing an amazing experience for one's taste buds. Whats even more awesome, are the daily lunch specials. These give you a regular entree, along with your choice of rice and your choice of soup or egg roll, for only $8.50 or so. ALL of the food is cooked well and never failed to please me. With the extremely affordable price that can sometimes be cheaper than fast food, and the absolutely wonderful food selections, Chinatown Inn makes a spectacular meal that can't be missed."}
{"text":"The Szechuan Chicken was pretty mediocre. Egg roll was like eating a wet rag and I've made better rice from Uncle Ben'S.
If you want decent service w slop for food this is your place."}
{"text":"The info screen says they deliver but they don't. They direct you to call a delivery service to place your order. Wasn't difficult but was an extra step. The order was confirmed by the delivery service and they emailed the receipt immediately but the order was incorrect when it arrived. The chicken Lo mein was ok but overall lacked flavor. The wanton soup also lacked flavor and noodles were overcooked. The vegetable roll was excellent though. They also forgot the plastic silverware and napkins which I specifically asked for."}
{"text":"The food is good the service is rude and slow. They make feel that they do not want you in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Looked this place up since my mom wanted to try their egg rolls, my brother goes here on occasion and always raves about the egg rolls. i decided to come here to look at the reviews and they werent all that bad except for a few. Those few were the ones i actually read fully. sad to say i must agree. 

Went here yesterday on a sunday afternoon around 2:30 or so. The place was clean and looked really nice inside. We were seated a couple of tables from the bar, which looked awesome, nice flat screen t.v. My mom and i had the wonton soup, egg rolls and pork dumplings as an appetizer. 

i thought the wonton soup and dumplings/sauce were very good. The egg rolls were okay but i think people believe theyre all that due to their size. One reviewer here said that the insides had the consistency of baby food. This was true...i had the chicken egg roll and when i opened it up everything was mashed together. im used to being able to tell whats in my egg roll, i had no clue what i was even eating. 

my mom had the veggie egg roll and she had no problems with it. We did have tea  and that was good. For the main meal i had chicken/beef chow fun and my mom had chicken chow mein. i stopped getting chow mein of any kind because its always all veggies and not enough meat. when hers arrived all i could see was green and white veggies with tiny strips of chicken. Mine had flat/fat rice noodles with huge chicken pieces and i had to literally try and find the beef. Whats sad is the chicken was bland,  while the beef actually gave the dish flavor. 

i could go to my local Chinese rest called No. 1 Chinese in verona and get better chicken than that. I dont agree that this place is THE best chinese place in pgh because pgh doesnt have really good chinese anywhere! maybe in other states just not here.

I would go again because im curious as to how their general tso's tastes and i really liked the chow fun. i just wont get it with chicken next time : P"}
{"text":"Fast service, great meals, and cheap prices. This is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I don't even go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my food . Ordered vegetable curry it was good mixture of rice and vegetables i love it."}
{"text":"This was perfect for what we wanted, today. The employees were extremely polite and quick to deliver. The food was better than expected. We would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a little girl and have never been disappointed. The service is great. Tea is fabulous. The jumbo shrimp egg rolls are a must! I had the plum wine yesterday and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food while we were in town for the weekend, and boy, am I glad I found this gem! It's on a random side street and not very close to anything else in downtown and from the looks of the outside, I was skeptical of the place. But from the service to the food, it was delicious enough for us to go back AGAIN before leaving Pittsburgh! 

We started our order with fried pork dumplings which were pretty good. Not too doughy and ample meat inside. Then we ordered the Mongolian Beef which was fantastic, the sauce alone was tasty enough to just eat by itself with some rice! We also got Pork fried rice which was probably one of the best I've had ever (and I eat a lot of Chinese food)! I also got the General Tso's chicken which was a HUGE order and I felt so bad we couldn't take the rest home since we were staying at a hotel! 

The second time we went back, we got the Mongolian beef again and Pork Egg Foo Young. The only thing I wish was improved, was the gravy for the egg foo young. I'm used to having the creamy brown gravy and they serve it with a watery dark brown base which took away from the flavor I'm used to. All in all, I would recommend this place for an inexpensive and quick fix for your Chinese takeout cravings!"}
{"text":"Probably the best chinese food I have had in the area. General Tsos was awesome! Definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"It's pretty obvious they don't need my 5 star rating because everyone else pretty much agrees. This place is a best kept secret of pittsburgh. I live 60 miles away and I'm positive there is no Chinese food as good in those 60 miles. Sechuzan chicken was spicy but the food was o man sooo good. And then I general tso on another occasion in the last week, just as good!"}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual
The Service: Inviting, Friendly, Quick 
The Food: Great Variety, Flavorful, Large Family Style Portions

Highly Recommend General Tso's Chicken & Beef, Pork Fried Rice, and their Fruity Cocktails! ;-)"}
{"text":"Chinatown Inn is one of my favorite places to eat in downtown Pittsburgh.  And also for about 10 years has been home to parties on the 2nd and 3rd floor hosted by The Humanaut Crew and sometimes others.

Chinatown deserves 5 stars just for their carpet alone: http://www.flickr.com/photos/soulglo/2969694288/

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is real.  If you ever get the honor of being at a party upstairs, you would get to see this yourselves in all its majesty.

That said, the food is good too.  Much better than any other place in downtown and it is worth the trek across downtown to eat there for lunch."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years...  the best eggrolls and homemade duck sauce on the planet.  Soups (Hot and Sour and Wonton) are also excellent - although there is quite a bit of variability to the Hot and Sour.  If I were rating the restaurant solely on soup and egg rolls, Chinatown would deserve a 5, but the meals, to me, are just slightly above average."}
{"text":"Its very simple...I am from New York City, I work for a Michelin star restaurant and am pretty critical.  This was possibly the best Chinese food I have ever had.  Fresh, quality ingredients and great service."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years I basically tried everything on the menu and I have to say everything is good this is the best Chinese food you will get in Pittsburgh hands-down it's not New York but it's the best for Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"General tso white meat is delicious. Their sauce is great.  Fast service and reliably good. Their egg rolls are my absolute favorite. I usually skip the egg roll and get soup, but not here. Shrimp egg roll rocks just don't eat it immediately and burn the roof of your mouth."}
{"text":"everything really good.  egg rolls are huge.  spicy is spicy.. very happy with the service on the phone as well."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Chinese food on the Eastern half of the USA! The egg rolls are to die for, literally!  I have been in Chinatowne of NYC, Washington, DC, San Francisco and others...no where has fresh authentic Chinese food like  The Chinatowne Inn on Third Ave, Downtown Pittsburgh.  I have brought people here to eat that have been in top Chinese restaurants of the aforementioned cities and others. They agree after they eat here!"}
{"text":"\"Average\" is the best description for Chinatown Inn. A very friendly staff, the take Amex,great cocktails, nice presentation and generous amount of food can usually one one over. However, there was something lacking with flavor in all three dishes.

We ordered Shredded Chicken with garlic, General Tsao's beef and Pork Dumplings. All lacked flavor and were somewhat bland. All were hot, came nicely arranged and looked very appetizing. When you took a few bites, it was edible, but I think the presentation raised my expectations prior to taking a bite.

Would I go back, probably not. If I lived or was in the area and craved Chinese one night would I go back, probably yes but with much lower expectations."}
{"text":"Chinatown Inn is great! Service is great and the food is amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxed. I love eating at the restaurant more than when we have ordered take out..it just tastes better when you eat at the actual restaurant! The prices are affordable, and they offer a giant eggroll as well as a normal sized one! Everyone should support this Chinese restaurant, especially if  you want quality food!"}
{"text":"While it was pretty busy on a Friday afternoon around 1pm, we still managed to snag a table.

The efficient servers take your order quickly, and your food is served fast.

The all white-meat general tso's chicken was being pushed hard showing up a couple times in LARGE PRINT.  It looked wholly unimpressive when it came out.  Appeared to me to microwaved very consistent sized/shaped pieces of breaded chicken with a thin general tso's sauce. It was definitely unremarkable. This must cost them $1.75 to make.

The chicken lo mein was much tastier, and egg roll (ordered shrimp, got vegetable instead) was good and crunchy.

The price was very reasonable, service fast, and the food hit and miss.  I know people really like this, but they've got to do much better with a standard staple like general tso's!"}
{"text":"Genera Tso's - White meat - was delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised there were a few pieces of broccoli included in the lunch portion - always hope for that sweet sight!!!     

Love that spicy mustard .. *kaboom* .. awakens my taste buds"}
{"text":"I live in NYC and was here in Pittsburgh at the UPMC hospital visiting. This was better than any Chinese food I've had in NYC. 

Our waitress was a delight. Great service. We ordered the spicy Szechuan chicken, the crispy spicy beef, and the combination fried rice. The crispy beef was ACTUALLY crispy and actually beef (not a mystery meat). In general the food was not overly greasy or saucy. Portions are very large- we brought a lot home in to go boxes. 

Restaurant is large and was not super busy at 7PM on a Thursday.  HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Wonton soup tastes gross like they never change the soup in the pot. There's nothing inside the wonton. Worst wonton I have ever eaten. Sweet and sour chicken is wayyyyy too sweet to me. Yuk."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Great food and service. My only complaint is the same as other people have said, the wonton soup. The broth is good however, the wonton's are not stuffed with anything so it's basically broth with wonton skins. 
Everything else was great! Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Okay- Love China Town Inn but the last 3 times that I have gotten Shrimp Fried Rice it just wasn't up to par.  I was highly upset the last time... thinking it was a fluke... I hope they see this and step their game back up."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just tried this place for the first time last night. Last night (middle of August, 90+ degree heat and humidity), I did not feel like cooking, so my boyfriend and I decided to get some Chinese food. He told he had been here years ago, but not recently, and I have never been, so why not give it a try?! We got to Chinatown Inn around 9 pm and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. (I did notice that a lot of people were coming in and out to get takeout.) Upon being seated, we were given water, hot green tea, and the crispy noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard. *note- the duck sauce at this place is more of a brown color and tastes a little different than the duck sauce I'm used to. Not a bad different, but different. Anyways, I digress... We ordered the crab Rangoon for an appetizer. I ordered a mixed seafood Chinese hot pot and my boyfriend ordered chicken and eggplant. The menu is really diverse.. They have a little something for everyone. Our food came out quickly and was nice and hot! Everything was really delicious and the portions were generous! My hot pot had lobster tails, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and Mixed veggies in a garlic and ginger white sauce. It was so good!! I definitely will be back to try out some other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it more, I swear.  I thought the mudslide was fabulous.  Sadly, the hot and sour soup, while good, was not spicy enough.  The Mongolian beef looked nothing like Mongolian beef I have ever had.  It was good, but again, not spicy enough.  Additionally, there were no sticks to eat with, no soy sauce or mustard or chili paste on the table.  The food tasted good and was cooked well (plenty of places overcook Chinese food so this is a very good thing), but it wasn't flavorful enough.  I am willing to go back and try it again.  The people were extremely nice.  It was a slow night so the service was a little slow, but helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner Sunday evening for delivery and was very upset with the service. They said the food could take an hour (which sounded like a lot, because I live on the North Shore and they're downtown). I called after an hour when the food still hadn't arrived and I was hung up on. I called 20 minutes after, to see if I needed to cancel my order and the server guessed the food went out. About 2 minutes later I got a text that read only \"Food\". I thought maybe there was a language barrier, but when I met the delivery service, the man was clearly a native speaker. I'm shocked at how bad the service was, and that no apology was offered for my wasted evening. The food ended up being good, so dining in may be an option, but I would never order delivery."}
{"text":"If you are trapped downtown, I can see this being a good place for variety sake, but in terms of Asian food, I've had much better Asian food in desert towns like Reno and Tempe.  

Now, I don't think it is fair to stack a business against the comparisons of the best in other U.S. cities, so I really only am basing this review on the moderate level expectations I had after reading the other reviews that made me want to try this restaurant.

Unfortunately my experience was so disappointing that I doubt I will try eating here again.  

I tried the War Shew duck dish (BREADED) - it was tough which I've never had tough duck to this degree but the breading I didn't expect at all - expected crispy duck from duck skin not weird breadcrumb style. I should have clued in from the \"golden fried\" description on the webpage but I was thinking more along the lines of a golden fried duck skin.  I did not finish the dish. 

The other dish I had was a chow mein dish with vegetables in it but I can't remember what it was because it was just glutinous uninspired slop.

Just so disappointing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. 

I frequently have Silver Palace deliver food to me and I have dined in before. 

I love the food (especially the curry chicken) and the staff is genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"Ok Chinese food. Delivery was fast to our hotel but messed up on a few items or else they would of gotten a 4. Better Chinese food in Toronto for sure"}
{"text":"For either Delivery of Take-Out this establishment never disappoints!  The quality of the food is always superb and the staff has been extremely friendly both in person or over the phone.

When ordering for lunch, order nice and early, while delivery itself is fast you could be in line with the lunch rush.  The food is too good to have to wait!!

In person, the restaurant fills up fast.  They're good about accommodating small and medium parties.  The only bad thing is that it can feel crowded."}
{"text":"Had my sister's birthday dinner here.  We order 5 dishes and ate with rice. 

I thought the dishes were good and the portions were pretty good size.  I can't remember the dishes that we got but the chow fun, Mongolian beef, dumplings, and chicken fingers(sweet and sour chicken with the sauce on the side apparently) were really good.  

The dining area was clean, nicely decorated and lighted.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was walking into the dining area and have tables full of white families staring at you like they never seen an Asian person before.

I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"I will make this quick because we only ordered lo mein and a eggroll for takeout. 

I happen to agree with Lucretiz about the eggrolls...way too much goop. It made me feel like mush mouth when I took a bite. So, we won't do that ever again. 

I do have a good word about the chicken lo mein tho. Let the church say \"Amen\"! The chicken was juicy and flavorful but not overly salty which is perfect. The veggies mixed in were fresh and full of flavor. It was worth the bill. 

While the food from here wasn't stellar, it was good enough to make me keep the menu to order takeout again in the future. They've been in business for a long time and it was packed when I dropped in-- good sign. Crowds say a lot to me so I can't wait to order something different for us next time."}
{"text":"Quality Chinese food and very nice atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant. Two knocks in my opinion. A little pricey and do not openly ask if you want a soft drink. They give you tea and water, which is fine and healthier, but if I'm getting Chinese then more than likely I decided to forego eating healthy.

I typically get the General Tso Chicken or Shrimp Fried Rice.

On a side note: Best Eggrolls in the city by far."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Chinese restaurants where I ate growing up.   Servers are friendly (they remembered us!) and food is always hot and plentiful.  My regular dish, Ma Po Tofu, is relatively inexpensive and comes in a large bowl with good-sized squares of tofu to enjoy and take home.  The cashew chicken came with a handful of large cashews on top.  Place was bustling, with everyone looking like they were enjoying their meals too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not in Carnegie it is in downtown pittsburgh- why say its in Carnegie Ill never know? But Ive eaten there and it is sooo goood like Chinatown in San Francisco! I lived in San Diego Ca & missed that food! This is sooo goood! I love the real chowmein not other places dont make it at all! EggRolls great! But remember this isnt In Carnegie!"}
{"text":"The waitress served us today is really rude and mean. The whole dining experience is disgusting"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Chinese in the city!! This place might not look like much from the outside but the food is incredible. The prices are right too!"}
{"text":"Just awesome. The broccoli side dish was melt in your mouth. The pork soup dumplings were to die for. The lamb soup is excellent - even my kids eat it."}
{"text":"Ate here because it was on the way from the T station to our hotel and we didn't want to wander. Pleasantly surprised to see a busy restaurant despite it being an obscure location and after 8pm on a weeknight.

Food was very good; huge eggroll and \"small\" order of fried rice. Service polite but not super-efficient; our food came out in dribs and drabs, and not because they brought appetizers before entrees."}
{"text":"Walked over from our hotel. Excellent food and waitress was very nice. Good prices would recommend friends there."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner from http://www.mealsdelivered.net/ from Chinatown Inn. I got chicken and cashews for my wife and Lamb for me. It is the best Chinese food I have found in Pittsburgh. Great ingredients  and taste. I intend to go there for a meal real soon. 

Highly recommended unless you have a ticket to NYC, SF or Hong Kong"}
{"text":"I am puking a little in my mouth, just writing this review.  I will never spend another dime at this establishment.  The eggrolls are gross and the insides are mushy and soggy they taste like they have been prepared a month in advance and the vegetables inside have the consistency of baby food. I ordered a sweet and sour chicken. The canned fruit was cold as if the cook had just dumped it onto the plate right before serving.  What a disappointment of a restaurant my family and I use to love eating here."}
{"text":"Got takeout.
Quick, courteous, clean.
A bit greasy for my tastes, but certainly within expected for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding. The 
Szechuan Chicken was delicious and perfectly spiced. The Shrimp egg roll was huge and the hot and sour soup was some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant that was very clean. I was greeted and sat in a very timely fashion. I was there around 11:30am which is lunch hour, and the service was very quick. We ordered from the menu and the food was out at our table in 10 minutes. The food was good, but the portions of chicken were smaller than normal, with a huge portion of rice. The egg rolls here are cooked excellently and very crispy. I would give the egg roll a 10 out of 10. I would definitely go back and have lunch again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in the Burgh. I am obsessed with their shrimp egg rolls, they are by far the best I have had since Lotus Garden in Brentwood closed a few years back. My family & I have a tradition to go out for Chinese on New Years Eve & this spot was no disappointment. Parking was a breeze as there is a small parking lot next to the restaurant- how refreshing for Downtown! We all loved our meals- honey sesame chicken, general tsos chicken, wonton soup, crab rangoons, shrimp fried rice and chicken chop suey- everything was fabulous and the oolong tea was the perfect compliment to it all. The service was out of this world as well, even when the restaurant started to get pretty busy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.
Big Portions
Great service"}
{"text":"best wonton soup in the city.  amazing egg rolls.  sweet aquarium up front.  delicious broccoli with garlic sauce (don't judge me for ordering this).  i will always say \"yes\" to coming here!!!  

parking can be a bitch, but you're downtown -- so it's no surprise/fault of chinatown inn."}
{"text":"The absolute best egg roll you will ever find anywhere! Make sure you try their won ton soup as well!"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh on a business trip, found this place unexpectedly and decided to try out its authenticity. Beef chow fun was actually pretty good, almost close to the ones I get in NYC. Portion was huge. Also got the small hot and sour soup, it was actually a lot smaller than expected. Use to a small being a pint container but this was smaller than that. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Chinatown Inn hasn't changed its decor or menu since I've started coming here, it hasn't changed since my mom and dad started coming here, and it's not likely to change anytime soon.  And that's the way we all like it.

I came here with some of my union brothers and sisters after a training seminar.  We all had a hankering for some good old Americanized Chinese food and few other places around here could satisfy our cravings.  We all started out with some soups (I tried the egg flower-delicious) followed by a mix of appetizers such as vegetable rolls and steamed vegetable hand-rolled dumplings.  I went for the broccoli chicken, but we all did a little family style sharing of our dishes.  So we all did a little sampling of ginger and garlic shrimp, curry roast pork, and some vegetarian dishes.

It was a great evening with some great colleagues.  Oh and my fortune cookie?  It said \"You are a person most generous.  Pay the check.\""}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my Mom and had shrimp fried rice with a shrimp egg roll. Delicious as usual and we went at 11:15 am 10 avoid the lunch rush. Been eating here for years...never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Chinatown Inn is the BEST CHINESE RESTURANT I have found in North America! HUGE FAN! and have been supporting Chinatown for over 25+ years. I can't say enough about this restaurant. I have had lunch in , dinner in and have had take out numerous times over the years. Chinatown has NEVER disappointed me once. I love the Shrimp Eggs Rolls, Chicken & Broccoli in the white sauce with steamed rice. I live for the Won Ton Soup !! it is so unique that they shred the pork on top of the soup and not inside the wrapper, I love that. I always get a medium bowl and a medium steamed rice on the side. After I eat the won ton, I put the rice in the soup and enjoy two soups from one bowl. Won Ton, and Chicken and Rice. The Jumbo Egg Roll is a meal in itself. Everything on the menu is good. 
True the downside to Chinatown if you do not live in town is driving in, street parking is not a problem for pick up, and there are many parking garages near by. A visit to Chinatown is SO worth it. Lucy is a fantastic server and I look forward to talking with her every time I visit. I Highly Recommend and will continue to support Chinatown Inn.  

Just as small side note: The actress that is the voice of Mulan in the Disney movie, is Ming-Na Wen. Her step-father and mother and younger brother have owned and operated Chinatown for years and will continue too. You can find her photo on the wall near the register."}
{"text":"The old standby for takeout food at lunchtime, $9 gets you all you need. Very fast and good."}
{"text":"This is the last Chinese restaurant left standing in what used to be Pittsburgh's Chinatown. It sits on a side street next to the city county building making it kind of a hidden gem. My coworkers and I arrived as soon as they opened and it filled up pretty fast. We were in and out within 30 - 35 minutes. If you are looking for a quick spot for lunch, definitely give this place a try. 

I ordered general tso chicken with white rice ($8.88). I also specified that I wanted white meat because some places make general tso with dark meat. The rice was a little hard and not as \"sticky\" soft as I hoped it would be. One thing I noticed was the batter to chicken ratio was off. There was definitely more batter than there was chicken and that could be why it was so crispy. As much as I like crispy chicken, I wish there was more chicken under all that batter. You also get your choice of soup or an egg roll. I ordered wonton soup and was very pleased with the size of the wontons. Some of my coworkers ordered egg rolls and I have to say they were probably the biggest egg rolls I have ever seen. In my opinion, the general tso was good. I can't say that it beats sesame inn or jimmy wans, but if you are looking for a nice and clean authentic Chinese restaurant I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"There is a super delicious, cute little Chinese place downtown - who knew?

We didn't. For years. Until we went on a Just Ducky tour.

We found out about the Chinatown Inn when we learned, on our Ducky tour, that there used to be a full Chinatown area in Pittsburgh. Aside from a few building facades, the Chinatown Inn is the last standing remnant of that era, and it's tucked away on a side street that makes it nearly impossible to find without word-of-mouth or a wrong turn directing you there.

And it's a shame to miss this place. It's so cozy inside, quiet, carpeted, and lined with thickly upholstered booths that give you the impression you've escaped busy city streets and stepped into a magical, relaxing little cove.

We ate just about everything on the menu. The wonton soup is probably the #2 wonton soup I've had in Pittsburgh. Their wontons are not stuffed, but the egg noodles are thick, and the bowl is filled with chicken strips and scallions. Delicious!

Even with lunch, they bring you a pot of tea at no charge, and the lunch specials offer either an egg roll or a soup of your choice for under $8. (The only odd thing is that there's no pork on the lunch menu. Not sure about dinner, but it was just chicken, beef, and seafood for lunch.)

We also added on an order of the crab rangoons, which were my favorite part of the meal. They were so crispy on the outside, so creamy on the inside. If I was craving crab rangoons, I would go out of my way to stop in here for an order.

For our entrees, we got sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken. Both were excellent. Like the crab rangoons, they achieved that perfect mix of crispy outside and juicy inside. But what I was most impressed with was the balance of meat and sauce: too often, Chinese restaurants end up overdoing the sweet and sour or General Tso's sauce, but this was just right.

We also sprung for one of the 'jumbo' egg rolls. I'll say this: it was definitely jumbo! It was the size of about three regular egg rolls (picture posted in the photo section), but the problem was that with it being so gigantic, the insides were a little mushy. The outside was perfect though, but I think if we got egg rolls again, we'd go for the normal-size ones.

All in all, this place was a hit. They've got a full bar, takeout, and really prompt service. We were in and out in well under an hour, so if you work downtown and are in the mood for Chinese, this place is just right!"}
{"text":"I've ordered lunch delivery from this place a few times since I work downtown and it's a quick, easy lunch. I was even more impressed when I went to the actual restaurant! This place is huge--you would have no idea from the outside. 

The best part is their egg rolls. They are definitely homemade and GIGANTIC. Apparently they also do jumbo egg rolls which I can only imagine are the size of a burrito since the regular ones are so hefty! I've had a few of the basic dishes here and have never been disappointed--Shrimp Lo Mein, General Tsos, Chicken & Broccoli. While I don't ever mind dark meat chicken, I know others who really appreciate that you have the option of ordering white or dark with their General Tso's platter.

Whether you want a sit-down meal, take-out or delivery--this is a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Meh, this place is OK. Pittsburgh Chinese sucks so there aren't many options, it's pretty much here or Mandarin. I usually go Mandarin if they are open. This is a decent back up when they are closed-- delivery on weekends is weird.... just saying'."}
{"text":"i've lived in pittsburgh 4 years and surprisingly ive never tried chinatown inn. I have my usual chinese spots and i normally dont steer away from them. 

Today however, i was in the mood for chinese but remembered that i only had enough bus fare to get home rather than an unlimited pass.. so taking a bus to my usual chinese place was out of the question. I had my mind set on chinese so i decided to try out chinatown inn since a coworker raves about it.

I ordered my usual-- general tsos lunch special. You get to choose soup or egg roll. I chose a chicken egg roll and ohmygoooooodness it was huge.. like the size of my fist. I also had the option of white or fried rice and went with fried. 

The lobby as well as the dining area seemed nice.. The girl who took my order was very kind as well as the gentleman who brought it out (in 5 minutes with no call-ahead, wooh!)

The main reason for only 3 stars is i didnt really care for the food :\ My chicken was tasty but i did not care for the general tsos sauce. It was super thin and extremely sweet. im used to a spicy, thicker(sticky) sauce. Also, the fried rice had one (tiny) piece of onion.. i didnt see any egg or carrots, ect... just rice and bean sprouts. Finally, every chinese joint i've been to i had enough for lunch + some leftover. Chinatown inn offered same food, same price but smaller portions. 

I may head back to try out something else or just stick with the egg rolls. The food was not bad but it wasnt my taste. If you like sweet general tsos sauce then you will probably like it :)"}
{"text":"Tried to get delivery from here to Troy Hill and they refused. I called once and gave my address and they confirmed they would deliver.  I put together a very large order and called back to be told they only deliver within a 3 mile radius and we were 3.3 miles away. I asked if they would please make an exception and even offered to pay an extra fee only to be told the delivery driver refused. Never again!! Not nice people and zero customer service!"}
{"text":"Oh Chinatown Inn, how I love the.  Let me count the ways: Open late, Clean, Friendly, well decorated, Excellent food, and.... (sigh!) just as excellent pricing!  I think that you'll be hard pressed to find a better combination for Chinese food anywhere in Pittsburgh.  I tried this place after hearing from several people that I HAD to go there.  It turns out that they were absolutely correct!  If you like Chinese cuisine, drag yourself into town and give this place a try.  Heck, even if you don't like Chinese food or are unsure if you do, give this place a try.  I liked it so much I am giving it 5 stars...  

I recommend the Egg Rolls (Very fresh), General Tso's Chicken, and Chicken Fried Rice.  If you go here and don't love the place then you just don't like Chinese food... and I feel very sad for you.  ;-)"}
{"text":"**I reviewed this restaurant on their other page with the ordering option embedded in the webpage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chinatown-inn-pittsburgh-2?ob=1), but wanted to share it here as well.

I placed an online order for delivery for lunch and I won't be doing it again. 

I ordered a vegetable egg roll and the eggplant in garlic brown sauce and requested that the spice level be medium. The egg roll was just okay - the duck sace that was provided came in small compote cups instead of the typical packets, it was also slightly brown and was bland. The eggplant dish was also unbelieveably bland. I've never experienced bland Chinese food, and all it did was highlight how greasy the food was. Since there was no taste, it became all about texture."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times now that I work on this side of the city and I've enjoyed the meals thoroughly! 

Their takeout service is really quick for lunch but I have also eaten in. My last meal there I ate in with a decent size group from work. We all order something different from the lunch menu. I ordered Beef w/ Broccoli and a shrimp egg roll. The egg roll came out first and it was delicious. A really nice size and packed with shrimp and veggies. The main dish came out and the sauce they use for the beef broccoli is pretty tasty. 

The water was decent and they do charge gratuity for a large groups more than 5.

I will definitely be back if im in the mood for some quick and tasty Chinese Food."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I've never been disappointed in my many meals. I often call in and get to-go food, and the nice ladies that work the phones/front counter/cash register are always friendly, greet you with a smile, straight to business, and usually don't have to ask, they remember me & load me up with plastic silverware plates, & napkins. Their restaurant is always clean, has a small bar area with booth seating, and the other section has more of a fine dining atmosphere. They serve you hot delicious tea and ice water upon sitting down.

If ordering delivery, they only deliver downtown during lunch hours because they deliver via bicycle. I compared the price when ordering delivery via yelp & foodler & foodler was cheaper (& also - that's a middle man to Meals Delivered - but I like my foodler points/convert to $).

The usually offer a coupon on their website."}
{"text":"Food was superb!  Service was \"slightly slow\" not with the food but afterwards getting the check."}
{"text":"I think THE best Chinese food restaurant that I ever been to. Portions are large (at least for dinner), food taste great, service is nice. Also they serve you complimentary tea with food. I would highly recommend it and will make a visit soon again."}
{"text":"Location sucks.. it's pretty hidden but the food is top 3 for Chinese restaurants downtown. They're always pleasant when I pick my food up (I go on my lunch breaks) and everything I order is delicious, every time. Giving 5 stars"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the city.  I always get the wonton soup - buttery and salty, with two big wonton. Lunch plates are lunch sized, but still generous. They have the best brown sauce of anywhere. Seating is a little snug, as they get filled to capacity every day of the week, but there's enough of a din to keep your conversations private."}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a great gem in downtown Pittsburgh.  The delivery is good, but it's even better when you dine in.  Make sure you get an eggroll and homemade plum sauce--they are the best in the entire world and I've never had anything like it anywhere else.  The chicken and broccoli, sesame chicken and garlic chicken are my go-to and are all extra delicious.  As others have said, lunch service is fast so you can get in and out on your lunch break.  We also get delivery quite often and it's always good and accurate and they are friendly on the phone.  Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now over the last two weeks. I had the Kung Pao chicken and the Szechuan chicken lunch specials (both $7.44 with tax), once with the hot and sour soup and once with an egg roll (getting two reviews here). Pittsburgh has crappy Chinese food, but this is the best place that I have come across so far (I've tried about 4-5 other places now). It does mainly cater to American's in regards to taste, but the two dishes that I tried were, in fact, pretty tasty. You will have to order the dishes extra spicy if you like spicy food, because the little chili pepper is not saying much. Now the lunch specials are a great deal: The portions aren't exactly generous, but it's about the same that you would get at a Chinese fast food place for about the same price, but with higher quality.The kung pao dish was loaded with water chestnuts and mushrooms (apparently I am the only person on earth that hates these two things), and had a hearty supply of peanuts. The S-chicken had baby corn, bell peppers and broccoli. On both occasions the fried rice was nice and moist. The hot and sour soup was on par with some of the best I've ever had and the (American) egg roll may have been the best egg roll I have ever had. The second time I came here I had to wait 20 minutes in a line out the door, so be warned about this possibility. Two nice touches about this place is the service and the decor. Most Chinese places throw service out the window but this place does not. They aren't big English speakers, but they stop by a few times to make sure your beverage is topped off. The interior is very pleasant with dark red painted walls and nice pieces of soft art.

I plan on eating here more in the future.

{"text":"This place makes me want to wave the Terrible Towel...

at the 1 and 2 star Chinese restaurants in California. 

Woot!

I stumbled upon this restaurant during my walk around Downtown Pittsburgh. The building was quite striking and hard to miss. Even the next day some kids riding in my shuttle bus pointed to that restaurant from afar, mistaking it as a tourist destination. The divided interior was just as elaborated with Chinese red colored from wall to wall. I came at the height of their lunch hour. It was a packed house but I still find myself the only Asian person in a venue where chopsticks had to take a backseat to forks and knives. The overtone of traditional aesthetics, English-only menu, and western utensils rendered my assumptions about this place, but relatively speaking this place was also to closest to what I see on Broadway in LA or Grant in SF. 

With $8.51 (w/tax), I opted for their lunch special combination with Szechuan shrimps and scallops with steamed rice. The dish came with a choice of soup and my bowl of decent won tons was comforting with strings of barbeque pork. After extended wait time, my dish came with a decent portion of jumbo shrimps and scallops stir fried with bell peppers, broccoli, baby corns, water chestnuts, and carrots in a brown savory sauce. The sauce reminded me of those cold winter days eating in Boston Chinatown while the combination was fresh with scallops being my favorite. 

For the price, it was certainly a better meal than any place named Panda. In terms of authenticity however, this place is far from Szechuan cuisine as the typical liberal applications of chili and garlic were desperately missing in the culinary discourse. Toned down Americanized and purposely catered to their mainstream clientele, 3 stars for the passable experience."}
{"text":"Good quality of food everything was fresh and didn't take to long customer service excellent. This is not Chinese fast food and has some good selections"}
{"text":"Ok. Average Chinese at best. Was expecting better based on the yelp reviews. Chicken schzwan was mild and bland. Would not likely go back."}
{"text":"Very solid place--food comes out fast and you get a lot. Lunch comes with hot tea. Lots of vegan options. I had the curry vegetables with a veggie egg roll. It was kinda like Japanese curry--more liquidy and has some nice spice. They had a very good chili sauce if you want it hotter. Veggies are broccoli, carrots, potato, onion, water chestnuts, snow peas, and baby carrots.  Was a bit too salty. The curry came already poured over the rice--I'm sure you can ask to get them served separately. Lunch special comes out to $10 even, which is nice. Egg roll is HUGE! Has cabbage, onion, and maybe carrot inside. Very solid. I would def return."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I have got to have in Pittsburgh till date. Loved their pork friend rice and Kung pao chicken . Very friendly staff. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Cutest  little Chinese restaurant ever. I've been coming here for years and the service and food is wonderful. Staff is very friendly, prices are fair and the portions are generous.Hands down the best Chinese Restaurant in Pittsburgh. Tucked away on a little side street in downtown Pittsburgh! What I appreciate most about the Chinatown Inn is that even when I call for take out or delivery  on a busy Saturday night they are pleasant and patient! REFRESHING!"}
{"text":"As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food. However, I can still always find something on the menu that I can enjoy. If it wasn't for my BFF's admiration for this place, I probably would have never gone. 

The atmosphere is very cliche downtown Chinese restaurant, but it works. I definitely felt like I was legit in Chinatown.

I ordered the chicken cashew dinner. Always a safe bet for me. The meal was good, except it was 1/2 chicken and nuts and 1/2 mushrooms. I'm not a huge mushroom person so I was taken back by how many were in my dish when it showed up in front of me. 

Service is okay and very average. 

A big perk about the restaurant is additional parking. It's probably the only place downtown that has a (free) parking lot for guests. You may have to drive around the block a few times, but I was able to get lucky."}
{"text":"When they say spicy, they mean spicy. And I like spicy so that's OK with me. But that's about all I found to recommend this place. The fried rice that came with my meal was very dry and no vegetables were mixed in. I also thought the portion sizes were small for the price. I'm from Philly so maybe they just do it differently here. Its a shame there not more choices because this is the only place in this part of town."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout from the Chinatown Inn and the food is absolutely AMAZING!! Delivered hot, fresh, flavourful, an absolute delight. I ordered the General Tso Chicken with fried rice and egg rolls. Delivered to my hotel is under 20 minutes. Would have walked to the restaurant, but it was raining, but the good thing is that delivery is a very good option. I would totally recommended this establishment. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"This place was okay, not the best Chinese food. I had the veggie egg rolls (these are giant and pretty good). The sweet and sour soup is very spicy but has what looked like beef inside which made it a little bit odd. The szechuan shrimp was okay, the sauce wasn't too great. The beef lo mein was also okay but some of the pieces of meat were flavorless. The water kind of tastes like dust lol"}
{"text":"While I agree with most other reviews, that this is the best Chinese restaurant downtown, I definitely don't think it is anywhere near five stars.

Nice atmosphere, like a darkened velvety place you would find in Chinatown, NYC.

The food, however, is basically the same as any small-town corner joint.  Their \"spicy\" items lack any heat whatsoever.  I requested that my last meal be \"extra spicy,\" and the receipt verified the order, but there was zero heat in the \"House Special Spicy Crispy Chicken.\"  

I will say that I was impressed with the fried rice that came with the meal.  Unlike most places, they included bamboo shoots, veggies and egg.  The fried rice was an easy 5 stars.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food! The combination chow fun was very good, I would definitely recommend it over a single choice like chicken. The moo shoo pork and soups were also good. Service was fast and friendly.  Would recommend this place if you are looking for Chinese in the area!"}
{"text":"6/4/2017: You never know when the last time to visit with someone will be. My co-worker and I ordered takeout here and it was delicious. The shrimp egg rolls were fat and delicious. The egg roll wrap was perfectly fried to a crisp. The vegetables were delicious. I also got a large order of BBQ ribs. They were delicious too and the sauce was sweet and also delicious. I liked this place so much I'm planning to take out again tomorrow eve bc parking is free after 6 PM. I plan to get (2) more egg rolls, chicken and broccoli, and General Tso w/ white meat  chicken. I will also try their tea.
6/5/2017: I got General Tso Chicken yesterday.  It was very soupy.  I like my sauce thicker and sticky.  I also got Chicken and Broccoli.  I liked it bc it had watercress.  I got (2) Chicken Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but I prefer the shrimp.  It was nice bc parking is free after 6PM.  

4/18/2018. Tax day is over!  I'm going to reward myself with some shrimp egg rolls.  The crispness and sweet flavor are delicious."}
{"text":"After driving for 7 hours from Chicago my friend Alison and I had to pick up my bud Natalia where she was working. Once I called her to say we were close she said she had to finish up something, so we parked across from this place and waited...and waited...and waited. Okay, maybe the wait wasn't that long, but the delicious smells from Chinatown Inn wafted into Alison's car and we decided we should just go there. And go there we did! Instantly I felt comfortable because this place reminded me of the Chinese places in strip malls in Northern Virginia. There were fish in a big tank, cozy booths, and rather dim lighting. They had a lot of regulars there the Friday night we went. Most people were talking to the waiters like old friends. Our waiter was young and adorable and looked like an anime character with his spiky hair. He showed us how to fold the paper bags into the triangle point. We were FASCINATED! I wish I could remember his name to give him proper props. I ate a spicy chicken dish that opened up my sinuses. I split a plain lo mein with Natalia because were just in the mood. Everything was hot and fresh. Lovely!

To note: if you happen to be an older gentleman who is bald and owns a beige sports coat, this is where your meetings are held! There were three booths in a row with one of these gentlemen sitting with his back to me. I felt like I was looking at an Escher painting!"}
{"text":"Just like I remembered.  Large portions, good wonton soup, average pork dumplings.  Need more broccoli in the General Tso's Chicken.  When they say broccoli is in the dish, 3 small pieces don't constitute vegetables."}
{"text":"A great place for Chinese food in Pittsburgh. Be prepared to spend a little extra but get your money's worth. Dinner portions are huge, flavours are great and they even have a small parking lot."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, it is truly one of Pittsburgh's jewels.  I always found their food to be good up until my last two visits.  The last two times I was left with really bad stomach cramps the next day or two after eating there.  This makes me really sad because when I had the food before it was amazing.  The service is always great and the pricing is perfect for the amount of food you get.  I do not know if the issue is just with me and my stomach but sadly I think I have to lay off this place for awhile."}
{"text":"always an amazing, friendly, delicious experience. lunch is great during the week days and i always come back for dinner & delivery!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Incredible Chinese Food!  The group of people I ate with had a wide variety of dishes, everything was delicious.  I would recommend the crispy beef or any of the lo mein combination platters.  Also some of the best tea I ever had.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for Chinese food downtown. My parents and I discovered it on a trip many years ago when I went to PPU. Their entrees are family size, so make sure you have either a) empty stomachs, or b) a friend to share the food with. Or c) space in your fridge at home for leftovers"}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star from me. I used do be a frequent customer about 2 times a month since I live down town and it's usually excellent. Well this time I got general tso, egg roll, crab wonton. General tso chicken was so mushy and the sauce was thick like it was left over from the night before. The crab wonton were so over cooked you could not rip them apart and when I finally did there was hardly any filling. Only thing that was ok was the egg roll. I called and complained because Chinatown Inn is expensive and since I was not going to eat it I wanted my money back. My Roomate got chicken Lomein and egg roll. She returned hers as well. Her Lomein was gummy and no flavor. We got back they were rude and accused us of eating half of it when there was 3 prices of chicken out of it and now in my garbage can. I told them to charge me for the egg roll because that's the only thing that's was good. They did but they were not happy about refunding us. Never returning terrible experience, terrible attitude about their own product."}
{"text":"We went there on our visit to Pittsburgh. We heard a lot of praises for this place and decided to visit. The food was good. We ordered beef Sichuan, sweet and sour chicken. They also give a chicken roll with the food which was out this world delicious. All the food comes with either plain white rice or fried rice."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from here for my wife and I. Food was good, nothing incredible,  but everything was priced relatively inexpensive. Big plus for being able to order everything online. Would have given 4 stars but delivery took an hour and a half, which seemed a little excessive."}
{"text":"Staying at the Districk hotel cross the street, it's super convenient. Sunday evening at 8pm, just wanted something light to eat, thank goodness this place was open! All I wanted is a large bowl of wonton soup, and it was ready in like 5 mins. The staff there was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Chinatown Inn serves up tasty dishes in a very short amount of time. I have been seated for lunch and out the door in about 30 minutes. Perfect for a downtown lunch break when you have one of those massive cravings for Chinese food.

A waitress will take your order quickly, and provide iced tap water (not a fan of the taste) and a pot of black tea (very good). A typical lunch special for me that comes in under $10 is General Tso's chicken with white rice, and either a bowl of soup or an egg roll.

The two adjoining dining rooms are very nice and clean with a combination of booths and tables. There also seems to be a small bar in the back of the dining room where you first walk in, but I haven't had a chance to explore what they offer.

Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Now that I'm working downtown, I'm looking for more restaurants open late. I'm so glad I found Chinatown Inn! Full Disclosure: I've only done take out but have been inside to pick up my meal. But inside looks nice and just like you'd imagine an old school Chinese restaurant looks like. I've ordered the veggie fried rice and lo mein: both delicious. Now I must speak about the egg rolls. I   L O V E  them. Probably the best I've ever had. Great sweet sauce too. Staff always friendly. Open late!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good! I've had Chinese food pretty much everywhere and this was very good. Not greasy and fresh! Must try!"}
{"text":"When I worked in town, I ate here every week, and loved it, but after retiring 2 years ago, I was never in town until this weekend.  The food is as good as it ever was and they have remodeled the inside.

Wonton soup was great, as well as the sweet and sour chicken, Kung bow chicken, and chicken fried rice.

Service is always good and the fortune cookies crisp.  Don't forget when you read your fortune to add the words \"in bed\" at the end.  Makes for a better fortune."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but last three orders have been horrible. I ordered string beans and chicken extra spicy. No spice and it was 90% string beans. As usual I asked for extra homemade hot mustard and needed nothing els and I get the whole bunch of condiments and just a tad of mustard. I used to think they were the best and sadly they continue to disappoint"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place. They have been around forever in the same location which speaks volumes about the place. It's a nice atmosphere with very friendly staff. The egg rolls are huge and the best around. I usually get my meal extra spicy. You get huge portions for the price you pay. Very fast service too. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday; the place was packed.... On a Tuesday!!! I'd have to agree with everyone else on here. The service is quick and friendly, the atmosphere is cozy, the egg rolls are the best around and the Tomato Chile Chicken that I got was yummy (although I wouldn't quite characterize it as \"spicy\" like the menu implied). 

With my total bill coming to $8.50 plus tip, I'd put the Chinatown Inn in the \"great value\" column."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Parking was free and convenient! Well done and very much enjoyed. The egg drop soup is the best. House special crispy spicy chicken was amazing"}
{"text":"Cute place, good service mediocre food, but a lot of it..Wonton soup was missing wonton filling,"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best restaurant around for chinese food or maybe I'm just a little biased.  During weekends, the next room holds a live karaoke and that's where I fell in love with this place.  The food is just as good!  I normally order the scallion pancakes, the hot won ton soup and chinese spinach and it's always tasted so good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.. highly recomended place for sure!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu updated. Service better this visit. Early lunch, so it's calm. The egg roll is sub par but had since crispy shell. Seems like it's reheated in a microwave. Quite a wait for main course. But it was worth the wait. Large portion.
Asparagus shrimp lunch, white rice. Good. Won ton soup, good but too salty."}
{"text":"First time to visit this iconic downtown Pittsburgh restaurant in the former Chinatown section, having only done takeout previous times. A classic, with the decor and also the hospitality including the comp hot tea delivered after you sit down. The sauces don't seem to be the type loaded with corn starch as typical of many Chinese restaurants. Freshly made steamed, handrolled shrimp dumplings were perfect. Szechuan Chicken was great as well with crispy vegetables in a light sauce!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Fantastic and friendly service. This place is my go to for lunch. The General Tso Chicken is my favourite. The chicken is crispy and well sauced. Their egg rolls are well filled and flavourful. The shrimp fried rice is the best I've ever had. Also if your a fan of Marvel's Agents of SHEILD there is a fun Easter Egg for you."}
{"text":"Good food but on the pricy side. It's the Best Chinese restaurant around downtown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was so delicious with generous portions. Pan fried noodles were simply amazing."}
{"text":"My waitress was rude and completely out of pocket! I paid for my lunch with a credit card, and when she came back to the table to collect my signed receipt she points at it the receipt and says very loudly as with an attitude \"don't you want to tip?\" I was completely taken aback and said \"No!\" (The caveat is I never tip with my card, only with cash so had she not been rude and disrespectful she would have gotten a tip) She not only walks away with an attitude she proceeds to \"sneakily' take my picture with her cell phone. So I took one of her... HERES YOUR TIP - DONT ASK FOR A TIP JUST DO A GOOD JOB."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and broccoli. It was very good. Large pieces of white meat chicken, crisp broccoli and a delicate sauce. I think I have tried them all in the tri-state and this is one of my favorites. My husband had the garlic vegetables. It was slightly bland but some people probably like a mild garlic taste instead of overpowering. It also had fresh, crisp vegetables.

I started with a chicken egg roll that just about filled me up. My son had a crab rangoon appetizer but it was a bit cold. We were the only table so that was odd. The taste was fine but we like them really warm.

The tea was nice. Many restaurants do not give complimentary tea anymore. When the waitress brought it out, it made our dining experience so much better. I know it's not much, but I think it is such a great compliment to dinner.

Pleasant staff and clean inside. Overall, I would love to come back."}
{"text":"It's very average to me. I came here two or three times so far, and every time it is because nothing opens on a Sunday in downtown Pittsburgh. I think I ordered general tsao chicken once and lemon chicken another time. I like the general tsao chicken but the lemon chicken was so bad, I have had lemon chicken back in Taiwan. It is nothing like this, I never NOT finish my food, but I didn't finish my lemon chicken here. The service is good though, and the complimentary fried wonton is what keeps me coming back on a Sunday to be honest. :p"}
{"text":"Horrible services and automatically charged gratuity! They even wrote down the percentage of gratuity directly on the credit card receipt, and just asked for my signature. Not to mention that the room for sitting was very narrow. Sitting at the biggest table, I thought the sofa on one side could only hold one person to comfortably sit on, even we were quite fit. That meant the largest number of people that could come to the restaurant and sit gracefully was two. The waitresses were not responsive. I asked a lady for three small bowls, but she did not give me. They never smiled, looking like I owed them money. Moreover, actually I can speak Chinese. When I heard that the waitresses were talking in Chinese, I started to talk to the lady in Chinese as well. However, in many times, she replied in English. A little bit weird, right? The last thing I have to mention. When we got the check, 15% gratuity directly displayed on the check. I gave them my credit card. When they returned the receipt to me, asking for my signature, I could see that they had already written down the 15% gratuity on the receipt \"on behalf of me\", but I never approved them to do so. This was such an offence to me. I will never come again. I hope that the waitresses there could learn to be honest, and never write down the percentage of gratuity on the receipt on behalf of their customers."}
{"text":"I want you all to know one thing, that this place, by far, has the best eggrolls you will ever eat in your entire life.

I have lived in Pitt, NYC, Cleveland, and now DC....no where comes close.  Chinatown Inn's eggrolls are out of this world.  While their normal food is also very good, their eggrolls and fried rice are all I really order when I am in town.

I always make it a point to get some before my trip back, and my family still goes to this place after all these years.  It's amazing, and you all need to recognize greatness when you experience it.

Eggrolls.
Amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food joints in the city. Everything i've ever gotten here has been amazing EXCEPT anything including their bean curd. Instead of cutting it up into manageable sized pieces that absorb the flavor, they throw in big fat pieces. 

Get the egg rolls, seriously."}
{"text":"I am gonna keep this one short and sweet.

I have not been dissapointed by anything I have eaten here. The wonton soup was a perfect balance IMHO; scallion pancakes are the best I have ever had and all of the entrees were a great blend of what you would consider \"standard American-Chinese\" food and the restaurant's individual flare. 

This place rivals places like Sesame Inn. And I know I will get heat for saying that, but that is solidly my take. I have been to the Inn several times, and am actually about to go again in a few minutes.

it might be the best prepared and most evenly-balanced chinese food in the city. I say might, because I haven't eaten at every place in the city. As far as I am concerned, it is the best. 

This isn't Asian Fusion, nor fine dining. 5 stars are given based on the quality of the meal...which is superb, and I think you will like it.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their food as we only do take out from here. BUT nothing compares in my book to the quality and portion size of their meals. For Chinese take out, it's a bit pricer than other places, but well worth it. Every time I order from here I am never disappointed, and I always have leftovers because it's just so much food 

Their egg rolls are so big and delicious and they also make their own duck sauce that they always include in the order. 

The only downside is that their location is not super convenient (unless you live downtown), but worth the traffic and drive to get this delicious Chinese food."}
