{"text":"Food was excellent, the 2 CREEMORE beer I had were SMOOTH as SILK & the Jazz band played SWEET SWEET JAZZ  !!! Our server was AMAZING !!!  She was so efficient, attentive & very friendly to our party of 4 !!!!  You can't see me now, but I'm doing CRAZY JAZZ HANDS !!!!!"}
{"text":"Music playing when we went was not jazz, but very bad country with a loud singer (it was a pay-what-you-can performance, so not sure if the cover fee ones are better). The food wasn't good, especially the fries here are TERRIBLE, don't get them. They came cold and tasteless and felt icky in my stomach. House wine was terrible too.   Really disappointed as I was excited about live jazz music. Maybe we were just there a bad night on the music, but I doubt it for the food. Will not be back to find out...."}
{"text":"The Rex is somewhat of an intimidating place to go alone for the first time, so grab a buddy, and hit it!  Your experience starts with the seat-yourself-wherever-the-heck-you-can-find-a-seat situation the venue has going on. If you're there for the music, just squeeze in the first two long tables right in front of the stage. You'll be sitting with other jazz lovers, so don't worry about getting close and comfy with strangers.  The servers have unbelievably awesome memories, and they'll get your order right, even though everyone's all sitting smushed together. The food is typical pub fare, but you're not there for the food, you're there for the awesome music!  Bring cash, because the cover is payable at the door, but the rest of your bill you can pay with plastic. If they don't collect a cover, they'll pass around a huge plastic jug for tips. If this is the case, the artists only get paid out of the donations, so be generous.  Hope you have a blast."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rex before for their outstanding local music unfortunately that's where my rave ends and becomes a rant.  The wait staff is rude and slow ( although the food came relatively quick) The music was too loud to hear our order, the girl taking my order literally looked like she wanted nothing more than to be anywhere else in the world.  The girl constantly rolled her eyes to everything said to her,  like she was above taking my order ( do your job).   When I purposely didn't leave a tip to make a point, I heard her complaining under her breath.  I gave all her tip to the band which often have collection jars.  A much better cause than supporting poor service."}
{"text":"The Rex is great and have always enjoyed the atmosphere and the music there. However, that beautiful long high table situated near the end of the bar and the mens bathroom should really be moved or even don't put a chair between it and the wall. As there is no room to move it back your natural path is to walk through the small gap leaving nowhere for your left knee to except straight into the rather large, well crafted protruding edge that you can't actually even see. My knee is still hurting the next day and well I wished I could have recorded the sound it made to play it back to the server who even though did apologize in that typical blase toronto \"sorry\" walked away and basically avoided us or at least as minimal as possible contact for the remainder to our hour +  stay there. As someone who has been the hospitality/service industry for close to 20 years this is NOT the way I would have dealt with the situation so total fail in empathy on the servers behalf.  I will return but you've been warned WORST restaurant feng shui  table alignment in the core."}
{"text":"If you don't enjoy drifting off to sleep listening to jazz at night, then don't bother staying at the hotel because that's how your night will end! My friend and I stayed in Toronto for only 3 days/2 nights while she had a conference to attend and this was just the type of place we wanted.  The Rex is conveniently located downtown for visitors on a long street of restaurants, cafés, bars and shopping--all within walking distance! The hotel upstairs is no frills, but it is clean and has all the necessities you'd need: hot shower, 2-in-1 shampoo and shower gel, heat and clean sheets. It really is the perfect spot if you just need a place to sleep on your travels.   Down below is of course the jazz bar, where my friend and I had late lunch after we checked in. I had the mushroom burger and while it was no shroomburger from Shake Shack, it was tasty and came with the good steak fries. The fellas that work there were all so helpful and friendly, and very nice to talk to! If my friend and I didn't already have late plans, we would have definitely gone back to the bar at night to catch that live jazz scene as well--sounded like such a fun time and looked like one, too, when we came back to the hotel at night!  Also great are the separate entrances for both the bar and hotel. I'd totally come here again if I backpack through the country."}
{"text":"I love this place. For free/cheap live music, this is definitely the spot. I would recommend getting here a little earlier to find seating as there isn't the best view points from the majority of seats. The food is ok and the alcohol prices could be better, but for a good and intimate live music experience, this is definitely a cool spot to check out."}
{"text":"An insulting experience.   This restaurant's strong suits are its decor, and location. The live jazz music was too loud to conduct a conversation politely indoors.   I was seated at a table by an elderly man. When I got the attention of a male staff member with black stubble to ask about service, after waiting for about 10 minutes. He sarcastically asked me if I saw him running around with a tray. He walked away ending the conversation that way.  I ended up ordering a soup after another employee took my order. Ironically, the same guy as before delivered it to my table, and dipped his thumb in my bowl as he placed it on the table.   Long wait times, terrible service, I can't recommend Rex's Bar under any circumstances."}
{"text":"There's no better place to experience live music in Toronto. The Rex is truly always a hit. I've never seen a bad show there. It gets busy, so arrive 30 minutes before show time, or earlier on Thurs-Sun nights. The menu is cheap and delicious. 13 beers on tap, though not much of a wine selection. Pay for the music either in the tip jar that musicians pass around (for earlier shows) or in CASH only to the doorman, usually under $10. If it's your first time, just ask the doorman for advice on where to sit and about set times and he will explain. The staff are friendly and quick. This place is just great. Lovely patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Busy place. Service is rushed. They will get to you but you better know what you want. Music is really good though. Server I had was not very nice. I actually edited this review because I felt bad and wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself (did not happen). When he did ask me what I wanted (after quite some time) he huffed at me when I asked him what was on tap. I felt like I was in the wrong for asking. (Sorry I thought that a server would be ok with that). When he said his shift was over and hurried me to pay, he was annoyed when the debit machine would not work (again, huffing at me). Wrong line of business pal."}
{"text":"I think some of the complaints of previous reviewers are legitimate (the food's not 5-star, the beer menu could be better, the occasional loud drunk guys in the front rows are annoying), but people have to keep in mind that the Rex is really the only club left in the city that is consistently playing jazz, and that is committed not only to \"crowd-pleasing\" stuff, but also to cutting-edge local and international jazz artists.  The Rex is in effect an international institution, and regularly brings in some of the best artists from Canada, and also from the Northeastern U.S.  It also has the character of a place that has been around for generations, and unlike some of the more pretentious, designer jazz clubs that have come and gone (like Opus, and Courthouse), there's something still very living and spontaneous about the Rex."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a friend on a Sunday evening. We loved the music - the band was very talented, and I was pleased to find that, because of where we sat (the right side), my friend and I were able to really enjoy the music but didn't have to yell too loud over it to have a good conversation.   The food was alright, but nothing to write home about. We both had the cajun chicken quesadilla with fries. The only major complaint I have about the place is the service. We were barely payed attention to and the waitress didn't really have answers for some of our questions about the menu, such as 'What's in the quesadilla.' It was also a bit disappointing that they didn't have dessert. Since neither my friend and I were drinking that evening, it would've been nice to stay longer to have dessert and coffee and enjoy the music instead of going elsewhere, but that's bar territory I guess.  All in all, I'd say a cool spot to have a couple drinks and hear some fantastic jazz."}
{"text":"Definately a very busy establisment after work on a Friday night. I would agree with some previous reviewers that you definately need to locate farther from the stage if you want to hear conversation. Being nearly death due to my younger days as a dj It was almost impossible to hear the person talking next to me. The Jazz was really good though. I ordered the standard pub fare of Nachos which were definately average but tasty.  Pints of Nut Brown ale went well with the meal. Recommend you get there early if you want a seat. There is no cover charge for the first part of the evening but the establishment hits you with a $10 dollar cover charge if you want to stay past 9:30. The music is probably worth the cover charge but my party was off to the next location. The Bar has efficient security as 2 staff members removed a drunk who wanted to join the band onstage fairly quickly and efficiently. Worth checking out for Homegrown jazz."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is the best!!!  A group of us came here after running the Scotia bank 5k so we were hungry and running on adrenaline.  The breakfast was cheap and plentiful!  The staff were also amazing as we got a bit boisterous at times.   Definitely would come back and if you go.... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always a good patio to stop at in the summer. Great drinks. Superb music. Attentive service.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The home for jazz in Toronto, and one of the best jazz clubs in the world. Great musicians, and a great variety of sounds. and the nachos rule. A must in Toronto."}
{"text":"Drink was mixed pretty well but getting the waiter to come back within 15 minutes is near impossible. Would have ordered an appetizer but the fact that he took that long made us decide not to."}
{"text":"Location, price, music, and hospitality.  My room was tiny but we knew what we were getting into.    The staff is extremely friendly and if the reception isn't open you can just go to the bar.  It's really nice esp since there are no fridges or ice machines etc that you can just ask the bar for whatever you like.   Unobtrusive help; if you are taking a nap or etc during the day they knock very lightly and it's never a problem to go downstairs if you need a trash bag or hair dryer.    The onion rings were so freakin' good.    The music is great and a great way to end your night.    Convenient location and no frills."}
{"text":"The Rex for us most of all is not the food place, but the jazz place. It is offering free shows and the event list is always very exciting, so if you are looking for something good for your ears, this is the place to go. We have been there few times, usually just sipping drinks, but happened to enjoy their sweet potato fries. Which were, as they usually are, good and sweet. They came with a nice dipping sauce and were very enjoyable with Club Cranberry. Go for the jazz, try the food!"}
{"text":"The Rex is my favourite place for Jazz in Toronto. The bands are amazing, spanning a wide range of genres. I have enjoyed impressive Dixieland, Blues, and all the way to Fusion at the Rex. The key thing at the Rex is the music and the wonderful community and warm company. People are so friendly-I was talking to a woman who later introduced me to her father-the band leader-a coronet player. I told him my son played the trombone and he invited my son to meet him and he said he would show my son a tune. The Rex is truly a place for music lovers who want a down-to-earth and authentic environment."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go to have a meal. It is a place to go to listen to great music and if you happen to get hungry, snacks are what best describes the fare. Sweet potato fries and Cobblestone Stout! Super ambience for amazing musicians."}
{"text":"It's not an upscale place, it's not a well-refined place, but it's my go to place when I visit Toronto. Live music stars at noon (NOON!) during the week (including weekdays!) and it's always good. Even if you're not a jazz fan, it's still great to sit there on a Saturday afternoon, take a break and listen to people playing music for the love of playing music. Basic drinks (nothing fancy but a good beer selection), basic bar food (nothing stands out but they try and it's always fresh). It can be difficult to walk through during busy times due to the configuration, but you get to meet some great people. In the summer, the outside patio seems to be pretty popular, but being a jazz fan, i always sit inside. And on my last trip I actually stayed at the hotel above the bar, Great rates. The rooms are sorta spartan but clean and nice. And you're right in the heart of downtown Toronto for a fraction of the price of the swanky joint. I shouldn't give this \"secret\" away but I like this place so much. See you again soon, Rex."}
{"text":"Writing this review primarily for the hotel, though yes, this is a GREAT place for jazz lovers! I just completed my 4th stay at the Rex while visiting Toronto for the 2017 TIFF festival. Why do I keep coming back? Mostly, I am budget-minded traveler and the rates at The Rex are extremely low compared to other properties in the getting-more-expensive-by-the-day Toronto area.  Accommodations are very basic but CLEAN and staff are extremely friendly. Rooms have individually controlled heating/cooling units and wall-mounted TVs. The bathrooms are surprisingly sleek and modern and again, extremely clean. Carpet in hallways is quite worn but just adds to the charm for me, I guess. Street facing rooms can sometimes be noisy, as you will hear the streetcar going by often, but as a city person, I barely noticed. Rooms on the first floor (which is the 2nd floor, if you're an American) may hear music from the shows going on below, so ask for a room on a higher floor if this will be a bother. For me, it was a plus, as I was too exhausted one night on a previous stay to check out the performance, so I was able to enjoy some of it in my room! I can highly recommend this property to solo female travelers for location and safety. Again, this was my 4th stay over 5 years and I have never encountered a problem. The Queen West neighborhood is chic, funky and vibrant with shops and restaurants galore. Great area to walk, even late in the evening, as there are many people out and about. The Rex is within walking distance of the entertainment district, including the Tiff Bell Lightbox and Scotiabank cineplex. It's also a 10 minute walk from the fabulous Art Gallery of Toronto (AGO) and close to lots of public transport.  I have enjoyed incredible shows in the jazz club and have always appreciated the diverse crowd of patrons, from hipsters to seniors. Never an attitude at The Rex! There are fancier places to stay in Toronto, but the Rex has won my heart."}
{"text":"maybe it was the band..  they didn't have any groove..and I'm a guy that likes the swing in my jazz...   also the place was packed and bad site lines outside of the tables in the front.... and the sound wasn't that thick and rich... I'm wondering if they could have had a better sound coordinator..  anyway.. so I gave it a two.. sorry...I'd need to come back and check out a different act.. I'm not into that cerebral....lets pretend not to have any swing...  kinda stuff.... call it modern..   call it whatever...   but the poor site lines  and the general pub feel.. wasn't my vibe.. not on that particular night...    sorry... but I'll be back.."}
{"text":"Du Jazz de haut niveau, de la bonne bière, à deux pas des grands hôtels du centre-ville. A ne pas rater sous aucun prétexte."}
{"text":"A great place to grab food, and see some awesome live music.   Came down from Mississauga to grab dinner there with a couple friends of mine. We had assumed we'd be seeing jazz performers, but the mix of reggae and soft rock that night was fantastic.   Cheap food, and a great place to grab dinner after a game at the ACC (about a 10-15 min walk)"}
{"text":"I really love jazz, especially weird jazz, and I've always wanted to come here so yesterday I got kicked out of the Second City training centre along with Will Sasso's brother so I figured NOW IS THE TIME.   One thing I don't like in jazz is vocals, ESPECIALLY scatting. And the lineup for the 6:30pm show, which was the UofT jazz ensemble, lead me to believe there were no vocals. However once things got started I realized, to my HORROR, that  was mislead. I was also terrified there would be a cover and I had only five dollars on and me and I'd have to go to the nearest bank machine to get cash and it was freezing cold. Luckily there was no cover and we walked right in. The relief washed over me in an awesome wave.   I paid $14 for a pint of Guinness and a vodka cranberry (both for myself) which seemed like a lot to me. The staff was quite nice and friendly enough considering how incredibly awkward I was being. My friend and I whisked ourself to a table right in front of the stage because I've read the sight lines can be really terrible the further back you are. The only downside to this was it was loud (obviously) and you couldn't really converse with anyone. I did however get caught with food in my mouth while clapping and a girl laughed at me. Jackpot.   The music was great, even with the singer, who changed after each song. You'd think they were professional musicians though they were students. Maybe they were professional. I have no clue! Played a lot of staples. We ordered the middle Eastern plate which had mostly stale pita bread and watery blue cheese. Is blue cheese middle Eastern? Everything else was very nice and the girl who laughed at me ended up singing a song and was very good, but her song was too sad.   I imagine there are a few intimate spots, but they wouldn't be where I sat. I've also stayed in the hotel here while shooting a music video and the service was pretty good for the price. Average. Small room, but I wasn't expecting much.   God bless"}
{"text":"One my favorite Jazz and blues clubs in the city. It's an easy going place with great musicians from Toronto. It's a nice place to unwind, even during the week if you're into jazz and blues. Can get very crowded on weekends. FYI there's a cover charge even when not busy (~$8) and bar prices have been lifted a little  bit since the last time I was there. (Guinness ~$8+). I can get very loud during performances and they frown upon talking if you're sitting at the front tables."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to grab some drinks after dinner on a Sunday night. We sat on the patio and split a bottle of wine. From the outside, we could still faintly hear the music from the inside, so it made for a relaxing atmosphere. Service is great and the patio is just quiet enough to enjoy some drinks and good conversation!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to learn my dear pal Brian Charette, the esteemed Jazz Organist, was engaged here at the Rex while I was in Toronto. BIG and most pleasant surprise. Made choosing the place for dinner quite easy. We got there late the first night, and I didn't really want a big meal, so I swung with some Falafels, and they were yummy. The second night, I went whole hog and did their Burger with Onion rings. A superb Burger indeed. The cocktails were a bit skimpy in size, and a little overpriced, but tasty and well-made. It didn't matter. Charette and his Trio tore the joint up. All-in-all a most pleasant couple of evenings. The place has charm and vibe... Go there!"}
{"text":"Yeah,  I really like this place.  They may very well have the closest thing to a real hamburger in the financial district, wait...Toronto, wait..all of Canada.  Greate staff, great music, rundown comfortable venue, and good food.  What else does a boy from the D need?"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I loved staying here. From the moment I walked in for my 2 night stay in June at 7am I was looked after so well by Bob, Avi and Lisa. I didn't get to check in until 11am but they looked after my bags, got me breakfast and just made me feel so welcome. One thing to note is the noise from the bar but for the amount of time I spent there it really didn't take away from my stay. Thanks to all at the Rex Hotel for a great few days."}
{"text":"Love this place for their weekend afternoon music, and they serve a great diner-style breakfast on weekdays, which is a well-kept secret."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend because we were in the area and wanted to listen to some live music (without paying cover that night - YAY)! Overall a 3-star experience.  Food: Typical bar food, fairly mediocre. The fries I ordered were super greasy and very over done, not even crispy :( I did order a Coors, and at least that wasn't watered down or anything.  Music: I forget the band name, but it seemed like an indie rock band of 50+ year old men still trying to make it, lol, and I can see why they didn't...Vocals otherwise, we sat at the tables right near the stage and had a great view the whole time.   Ambience: Mostly older folk and seniors it seemed...we were the youngest patrons in the entire restaurant! I love listening to live music otherwise - the sound and acoustics in the bar were pretty good. Very loud, I felt that bass!! Very dimly lit.  Verdict: Nothing really special. Wouldn't really come back unless I know the musicians playing, or am craving to hear live music without cover (most nights)!"}
{"text":"I never knew just how loud a Jazz club can get.  If parties are rated by how hard it is...partied...then The Rex makes Richmond & Peter look like a sponge.    This is an authentic jazz bar, and by that I mean the place is falling apart.  Falling apart from the hard jazz that is played here, and it's some fine jazz.   I got a table with a glass of white wine, my first visit here was during my white wine phase.  But then all of the sudden I grew bollocks and never touched that $*%t again.  The walls literally shook with the vibrations of the hard hitting drums and bass, the performers on stage were having themselves a bloody riot, and the patrons by their tables were jamming to each chord.  I honestly never expected such a lively atmosphere.  I always imagined a jazz club as a serene, dimly lit place with leather sofas, a grande piano, and a chick sitting on top of it, wearing the tightest dress possible singing into her microphone while making sexual gestures at her audience.  Maybe I watch too many movies.  The food was okay, the wine was okay..but keep in mind; this was a nightclub!   There are hotel rooms upstairs in case your night of blues turn into...well, let just say, the rooms are there in case you start your night turns from Highway Blues into a Sentimental Mood.  HAH!   A bloody riot, and the women are loose.  Great Jazz, can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Visited them a few nights ago at around 9:15 pm on a Wednesday night. The 9:30 pm show was about to start so the place was full to capacity. 10$ cover charge to get in. The show goes on till midnight with 30 min break in between. The show was okay. This was our first Jazz club experience in Toronto, we have had a much better luck with many different jazz clubs in Montreal. Maybe we came on a off day but we don't subscribe to their claim \"More Great Jazz than anywhere else, all the time!\"  The beer selection was good. The food was sub-par and pricey, for what they serve. I would very much love to visit the other jazz venues to try my luck as I hope that Toronto would have so much more to offer."}
{"text":"Like any classic bar, the Rex menu is mostly made up of traditional bar food. Unlike the others, they actually make the food fresh and not out of your grocer's freezer.  It was one of those nights where I couldn't decide on what to order. Nothing really looked that great and it was expected. It took me about 10 minutes to look through the menu only to end up ordering the Fish and Chips... My date however was quick to decide on the Caesar Salad. (Obviously)  Food came out exceptionally fast - it was almost like they knew what we were ordering. I'm not going to critique the presentation because let's face it; it's bar food. I have to say, my meal wasn't that bad! Two generous portions of breaded fish with a large portion of fries filled me up. I was satisfied and so was my date.  Moving on, the atmosphere was wicked. Mind you, this was on a Monday night and the bar was packed! I'm new to Jazz and Blues bars so this was a first for me and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. There's something about live music that allows people to connect with the artists musical message on a personal level. All the focus is directed to the performer and for that reason alone, I found a new appreciation for Jazz and Blues."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is always good - only downfall is its served only until 11AM. The food is decent and I've never had a problem with the service since I come here so often. The only downfall is their prices. They raised their prices in the new year and compared to other restaurants in the area, this is on he higher end for a lunchtime meal."}
{"text":"Food sucks here, the burger was undercooked with the middle still red all around, not to mention it had no taste to it.  I've made BBQ burgers that taste better on my old Foreman grill.  The nachos were also plain with no seasoning.    The music is 90% funky jazz with little blues despite the place suppose to be a Jazz AND Blues bar.  The clientele on a Saturday night were mostly old hippy couples and the place is dingy looking with decor that looks like it would have been on a restaurant makeover show.  I would recommend  going to Reservoir Lounge to enjoy Jazz in a more intimate setting with a more younger crowd."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, due to the live jazz.  Overall nothing too fancy. Not many food options.  Ended up having the combo platter, 2 jerk chicken dinners and on the menu trout with veggies and rice.  Food was decent, Jerk chicken was spicier than expected but very good.  The trout actually came out as salmon, and we were confused on the order as the waiter never said there was a change. We rushed our meal because, another waiter had informed us that if we stay for the live show, we will need to pay a cover of $15, therefore we only had 20mins to inhale our food.  Probably would have stayed for the show, but rather spend $15 on another drink.   Overall, this place is decent but I don't think its somewhere I will come back too."}
{"text":"The Rex is a casual jazz bar embedded in the Queen St. tradition of live venues that are accessible to anyone, nearly anytime you feel like walking in and soaking up some high calibre music. That's the kind of place it is, just like the Cameron House, further west along Queen, is roots-rock and folk, and the Horseshoe Tavern is rock and roll. At the rear are tables while near the front there is often standing room only on a busy night. Most people at this bar are casually dressed and could easily drift in and out of different places along Queen West so there is no need to be intimidated, and everyone's welcome. A tradition continues that helps makes the area world famous."}
{"text":"Haaa les concerts de jazz, depuis le temps que je voulais en voir un! Passez le pas du Rex et vous serez transporté d'un coup dans les années folles : des tables un peu partout, un orchestre d'une quinzaine de musiciens et le tour est joué. L'orchestre présent ce soir était composé de jeunes d'une vingtaine d'année dirigés par un chef d'orchestre. Les sessions solo sont fantastiques et on sent vraiment le partage d'une même passion entre les musiciens et le public.  Pendant que vous apprécierez le concert vous pourrez également commander à manger, on a accès ici à une restauration de pub classique."}
{"text":"I have loved this place from the first time I came here years ago with friends to meet new friends. I think all great cities need a jazz music venue and this place is that to Toronto.   They have bands playing every night of the week. The food menu is pretty standard pub fare, the drinks are fairly priced.   A must for anytime I am in the city."}
{"text":"This is super cozy spot. I've only ever seen great jazz acts. It does have cover but you can put it on your bill at end of night which is a nice touch. They serve standard brews on tap, but have all the classics which is great. I like their side patio on side of street, it's a nice spot to sit to listen to the live acts. It does get super \"cozy\" as the night goes on. Theirs always an interesting and fun crowd here, it makes for a great night. Great place for a night cap with friends or so."}
{"text":"Wonderful , what's this 10% off really?? Just a bluff?? Why a manager easily ignore any relation with yelp and this offer?? Not a professional customer service at all. Next time be more careful about your behavior business man!  Just one star for the jazz not you at all!"}
{"text":"I came here with a date and it was a really great experience. On a Friday night the cover is $10.00 (I'm not sure about the cover on Saturday). The Rex always has a live band playing and a good crowd (Mid 20's to 30's)  The band playing was really good! The musicians were really passionate about the music they were playing and my friend and I had a really good time.   It was a little challenging to find someplace to sit (we arrived after 10:30 pm) but once we found a table the waitress found us immediately and took our order. We ordered some drinks, which were good.    This bar doesn't have a blender so the drinks are pretty basic but the atmosphere and experience is really nice. From everywhere within the bar you can here and possibly even see the band.  The bar is laid out so everyone can have a good time.  If you want to go someplace where you can just relax with friends while listening to a band I highly recommend the Rex.   It's also great for dates as you can sit and get to know one another in a cozy environment, which beats your typical Starbucks."}
{"text":"One of the best place in the City to catch a free Jazz performance. The Rex been around for a number of years and the vibe is quite chill.  Walked in on a Tuesday night and enjoyed a jazz band playing while ordered some beee, Montreal smoked meat sandwich, portobello mushroom burger on a nice mountain of sweet potato fries.  The fries were amazing - thick cuts and totally hit the spot.  Service was very nice, not too pushy - it is a jazz joint after all.  Definitely a place to check out if you ever visit Queen West."}
{"text":"ALWAYS music to enjoy, with multiple sets every day.  Comfortable, friendly. ALL kinds of people.  A toronto treasure."}
{"text":"The Rex is now an institution on Queen Street West. You want a great place to listen to some great local jazz in Toronto? Then you found one of the top five!   They have music every single night of the week. However, you do NOT come here for the food or the decor. This place looks as if it has not had a reno in 20 years. Now, I have been coming here for at least 12 and they have not really changed anything inside in all that time. However if you are looking for a more \"upper\" class looking place then go to Reservoir lounge.   Also, if you come here early enough, say about 2 hours before a show then you don't have to pay cover, *HINT* *HINT* although you should just to help support the place.   Also, you will find that once the music stars playing, well, this is not one of those places where the music gets played in the background. It demands your full attention and since the place is small enough that you will literally not have a choice either way.   Unless you sit way, way, in the back but at that point you can't see the performers and one would question your intention of coming here in the first place. :-)  Highly recommended for a laid-back-jazzy night out."}
{"text":"I'm walking down Queen Street and I get rather lazy..not sure if I want to haul ass all the way to Queen West.  I see a wonderful little Jazz bar that seems to be half full of decent people minding their own business. I poke my head in..not too many people stare back at my curiosity.  It's a comfortable reaction.  So my body follows my head in and I seat myself down, order a glass of wine (or beer) and get myself a predictable portobello burger.  Everything is averagely good and the music is a bonus. Nice, friendly, what more could you want for a day when you weren't expecting anything?"}
{"text":"One typically goes to a jazz club for the jazz but I had a really awesome Portobello & goat/feta cheese sandwich on a perfectly golden bread. The taste combination of the mushroom, feta cheese, and pesto was wonderful. And it was reasonably priced.  I had the pleasure of listening to The Sicilian Jazz Project with Pilar. The place is big enough with tables up close to the stage and other tucked back. Efficient service. I would return to catch another live show."}
{"text":"5 stars to music but 1 star to the service. Why? I and my friends went to the bar to listen to a great jazz performance. My friend was so sleepy and put her head on table. I wish she was at least drunk! The rude waitress told me she should either open her eyes and sit or leave the place! I am mad at myself why I ignored this non-sense rudeness and didn't ask her to apologize. You see this ridiculous rule anywhere."}
{"text":"Great place. I went during a jazz festival and the place was filled to capacity with a crowd of all ages. The service was good despite the crowd, and the music was great. The drink selection is pretty standard. I think it was a $10 cover that night, and it was well worth it for the hours of music."}
{"text":"ok maybe I went on a wrong day and for the wrong reason but sunday noon wasn't my fave time there. Reasons: - no brunch options (maybe just my expectation though because I read about the Rex in the brunch list on blogto) - music is too loud (I don't really think that the speakers are required for the live band in such a small place where acoustic seems to be good) - and yeah the band was not very exciting. jazz is supposed to make you jump up and dance. - no young people in the crowd (that was the most surprising thing)  I don't think I'll be coming back but yeah the prices are not bad and there are few veg options which are pretty ok (portobello+goat cheese sandwich was good)"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot and generous portions. My friends and I had stopped in after seeing the sign for the $6 breakfast all day. Obviously that's quite a steal. Now going in, we were immediately served by the host. We were promptly seated and given tea/coffee.  Now the food fare itself was outstanding. The eggs and toast were cooked to perfection. The bacon was crisp. The coffee was strong. Everything you could ask for. Both of my friends raved about the food as well. All in all it was a great stay, and I highly recommend this place for a quick brunch run !"}
{"text":"Great friendly family-run Jazz club! Perfect for a casual night out. The food is meh but you don't go to the Rex to eat."}
{"text":"This place has a very college pub vibe. Which isn't a bad thing per se, but perhaps not my thing. The food menu didn't seem too appealing to me, although my date and I shared a basket of sweet potato fries which were good. Nothing above and beyond, but good. There was live music, and it was a bit awkward when the musician came around asking for tips while taking a break from his set. I say awkward because I knew nothing about this place before popping in and was not prepared for tipping the musician (which seemed to be the case with several other patrons). The beer selection was decent.. Nothing special seemed to pop out but all the usual suspects are available. Personally not going to be going back simply because it's not my preferred type of establishment but if you're into bar food, beer and live music (generally of the Jazz variety) and are less picky than I am, this could be a place you would enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome jazz on a Monday night, no cover, nice vibes. Only downside was the no-glasses bartender hosing down all the bar equipment at midnight (seriously, well before last call and closing), literally two feet from my drink, spraying nasty crap all over my glass, the neighboring patrons' glasses, and the unused, clean glasses nearby. We patrons just looked at each other surprised, while the bartender didn't even think twice. He generally didn't seem to care at all about his job."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on Queen West, this place offers good jazz for the price of a pint. Even mid-week, they regularly feature live performances while weekend ones command a nominal cover charge.   As another reviewer mentioned, stay clear of the stage area and any seating within its immediate perimeter if you want to keep your hearing."}
{"text":"C'est vraiment LA place à visiter. De la bonne musique, une bonne ambiance, de la nourriture mangeable et touuuuuut ca a un prix extrêmement abordable. J'ai été trooooppp surprise de me rendre compte que j'avais doit à un repas complet avec vin et dessert pour moins 30$ C'est vrai que ce n'est pas le baton rouge ou le madison, mais c'était mangeable, le vin buvable sans faire trop de grimace.   Le groupe présent ce soir était supeeeerr. Wooow J'étais présente du début à la fin de leur représentation et je n'étais vraiment pas déçu. Par contre, il est important de savoir qu'il faut payer a l'entrée (10$ par personne ce soir) cash. Donc il est important d'amener sa petite monnaie.  Il faut aussi se faire à l'idée qu'il y a aussi des gens qui viennent que pour être dans un bar, boire une biere et parler (et fort avec ça) donc essayer de vous mettre proche de la scène.  Amusez-vous !!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place is like a joke to me. I'm here on Saturday night, 11pm. Busiest time, so the bartenders mood obviously is not so good. Drink is weird, we had 1 Long Island tea and it doesn't taste Long Island at all. It's like an Ice tea. And there is a fried chicken, taste so blank, even worse then supermarket standard... well, On Trade market seems like a ripoff to me here."}
{"text":"Don't love the space, it felt really cramped. However, the food was good and the servers decent. Want to go back to hear live music, may change my review!"}
{"text":"Truth be told, this was go-to spot to get served when I was not quite of age. Although that was quite some time ago, so if you aren't 19, forget about it.  But the best thing about going here when I was young was developing a great appreciation for Jazz music. It's loud, it's soulful and boy, oh boy does it make you want to dance.   The bar itself is nice, lots of seating - make not to sit RIGHT next to the stage if you want to keep you hearing. Servers are friendly, food is satisfactory but you don't come here for good food - you come here for great music and a jazz-loving crowd.   The patio upstairs is beautiful, really huge with its own bar and a great place to spend a hot summer night - although you can't really hear the music.   If you want a great jazz experience in Toronto, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Amazing bar and great band. I heard they always choose the best. This time was the band from my home state. San fransisco.  The food was really good even though it was a bar food. I'm glad we visit this bar in our stay. Hopefully be back soon in our future vacation."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place for breakfast... It's always fairly quiet which could be nice when you're trying to get work done. They are open early. They will give you endless cups of coffee without batting an eye. The Wi-Fi is really fast, and the breakfast is just perfect, it's clean, simple, and pure. It's absolutely done to perfection every time. I find it's the places they didn't really start out planning to make breakfast that seem to make the best breakfast."}
{"text":"Ah the Rex.  A jazz institution in Toronto.  And one of the last of the major jazz venues.  It is the kind of place where you can walk in, at almost any time of day, and hear great music.  When I got on this jazz kick in 2013, I went once.  Not sure I'll be back again.  My take is that they can't decide whether they are a restaurant or a jazz club.    We gave our cash over and were told that the current act was ending so seating would free up as people left.  Yeah right!  Nobody left.  We were stuck standing.  And while some venues are fine for standing, the Rex IS NOT one of them--it is laid out more like a restaurant.  We finally got some seats at the bar but it was impossible to concentrate on the music.  Drinks and food were whizzing by every 30 seconds.  There was a lot of ambient noise and the lighting was totally off.  Again, this works for a restaurant but not for a jazz club.  I'd like to try it again, just not on a busy Saturday night.  The next time will be for a meal, either right after work or in the afternoon on Saturday or Sunday.  I want to support this place but so far I have found better places for jazz in the city."}
{"text":"this is a place you tell your friends about...we try to go in the afternoon..the music is fantastic, the atmosphere, exactly what you want.. loud, full of people all enjoying.  its meat and potatoes here.. no cushy lounge seating, over priced foodie offerings, just great music, and basic but great drinks.  the best.. its free in the afternoons.  so pull up a seat.. have a cold beer and be ready to have a lot of fun.!"}
{"text":"I miss going to this place, but prefer visiting during the summer when Tue patio is open.  Just love how it is so chill and the music is playing out on to the street.  From what I remember, food and beer were moderately priced and you had to pay a little extra every so often for the live bands playing."}
{"text":"last week Brian Dickerson turned the house out. On the 25th thru 27th  of September will be Kirk McDonald and Pat Labarrbera's annual John Coltrane Tribute.. Not one to miss!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't remember if I've ever been served such lousy food even in the last 25 years. The fries are a dark brown colour and very soggy and it's obvious that they haven't changed the oil in a considerable time, like over a week. I sent one plate back and got something else and it also had this burnt taste like the grill hadn't been scraped of god knows what carcinogens for eons. Every dish I saw coming out of that kitchen was over cooked and a dark brown. The beer tasted normal but at some $8 the price is getting up there. The service was dreadful except when it came time to get the cheque. The sound from the band was cranked up so loud that you couldn't talk to friends or hear individual instruments, the band was out of tune and out of harmony. I get the impression that they crank it up to hide mediocrity and to get the audience involved, but it does the opposite. The band I saw was no better than street performers, they just had more volume. There's bar food and then there's bar food that wouldn't pass muster at a prison, this is the latter."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Jazz music, I feel that I was born in the wrong era as I am a big 40s and 50s fan! The music the cars, the fashion, and the food! Every time I come to this cozy little spot I enjoy my time.   My brother in law plays in a Jazz band and they have performed here a few time, I have come to see them every time, but I also have come to see of my favorite bands from Chicago, NYC, and Louisiana. The music is why I come here, I love at atmosphere and the fact I can sit here and listen to some music over a few drinks. Out of all the Jazz clubs downtown this one is among my favorites and a top pick. I recommend you pay this place a visit it is worth a trip downtown.   The staff is very friendly and the service is quick, now I usually only order the starters so this may not be the case with the main courses. The sweet potato fries are quite nice. The drink selection is quite nice as they have a wide variety to suit all tastes, they have all my favorite liquors so I feel right at home."}
{"text":"I went to the Rex bar with low expectations for food and service, but high expectations for the entertainment. I was very surprised at how good everything was at the Rex.  First, our server was great. She was friendly, gave us everything we needed in a timely fashion, and she saved my ass (!) in the washroom by going and sourcing toilet paper! The entire washroom was out of any kind of paper, and in a less than 2 minutes, my hero server replaced everything. That's above and beyond!  We split a Greek salad and a cheeseburger platter for dinner and it was fresh and good. I loved the dressing on the Greek salad and the generous amount of feta. Very pleasantly surprised. Food was pretty cheap too. Mostly $9 -$14 a plate  Entertainment was very good. A big band (very big - like 15 musicians) covered Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\". You don't hear that just anywhere. Cover was only $7.   I am now a fan of the Rex and have bookmarked the website to return for more shows. Check it out."}
{"text":"We stopped in to enjoy some live music. The place is decently nice inside - set up well for music and to hang out, with a bar and a variety of bar-like tables. We moved around a few times pretty easily. The jazz was loud, but fun. Service was really good despite how busy it was. Beer selection wasn't great, but they had some good ones and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"You are kinda between a rock and a hard place if you're out see some stellar live jazz music.    This place is the place to go... the greatest players - starting in the late afternoon - 7 days a week.  Its just a little dingy inside... and usually extremely packed, understandably.  They have awkward cafeteria seating, with a few booths, and generally terrible sight lines to the stage from anywhere in the bar, other than right in front of the stage.  The food and beverage selection are decent and well priced.  I would go more often if they renovated!  Tip: Have cash for the cover charge at the door."}
{"text":"I really shouldn't give 4 stars but since the music was so awesome, I can't help it.  The hubs and I went for lunch on a random Sunday.   The service was probably the worst I've had in years.   Our server was obviously overworked and frustrated and it showed.  Not good sweetie.  If you are unraveling, go out back and have a meltdown, don't do it in front of customers.     We waited over a half hour just for 2 sodas and it was brought out from someone new so I'm guessing she finally did melt.     The thing that kept us sitting there thirsty and hungry was the music.  I was able to forgive them for forcing me to wait over an hour for a salad because a New Orleans jazz band was playing, and I was captivated.  The interior of The Rex is nothing huge or elaborate.  In fact, the eventual food didn't blow me away either, but the atmosphere created by the music and the crowd loving the music, makes this place special.     I think I went on a day where they were not prepared for a large lunch crowd so they didn't staff up well.  However, I would definitely go back to hang out, have a drink, and listen to the bands."}
{"text":"Great corner location on Queen st. First place I ever had a drink served to me. 30 years later, it's almost packed at 630 on a Thursday.  I don't really like jazz, the band is very good."}
{"text":"My friend described it as the most expensive hostel he has ever stayed in. I think that is an apt description, but maybe not with as much snarkiness as my friend entered. First off is the price. For downtown Toronto you are not going to find as cheap for as good. It is centrally located and every part of the downtown is within walking distance to the location. The rooms are functional, but sparse. The shared bathrooms were always clean and readily accessable.   The jazz bar downstairs, and I only ever heard jazz, does a brisk business. I could hear the music through the floor of my room, but it ended by midnight and was not too distracting. The only problem in the cold winter is that the room thermostats must be located in the bar because around 11pm at night when the bar is packed it starts to freeze in your room. But by 2 am your room turns into a sauna.   The bar and hotel staff are all very pleasant and helpful. The $5 breakfast is the best and most reasonable meal you will have in Toronto (except for Smoke's Poutinierie). Start your day off with it and it will save you cash.  Here is the deal. It gets 4 stars because it is a little low rent and not the most comfortable stay. It gets as high as 4 stars because it is fun, unique, and makes for a great story. Mostly though is for the price you get a comparative good place to lay your head. Anywhere else in down town with as much amenities is going to cost you 25 to 50% more.   If you are used to pampering and comfort, this is not your hotel. If you are looking for a cheap, cool place to make your base of operations as you spend 12-16 hours a day out exploring Toronto, then this is your place. And have the Canadian bacon, oh holy jeez Louise it's good eh."}
{"text":"I came here by accident. I wanted to catch bossa  nova at Dominion and in my mind, I was heading in the right direction and walked straight into The Rex.  Imagine my surprise when I heard dixieland jazz and no bossa nova. I asked the bartender about the bossa nova and he was super cool about my mistake, esp when I insisted on it. He didn't berate me or made me feel like an idiot for the mistake I obviously made.  The food ain't my type, the music was not what I was interested, but the bartender was a cool guy and I befriended him. He gave me some recommendations for future shows, which I will catch.    So the 4 stars are for Eddie for making me feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Places like this deserve international protection agreements. Established in or around 40 years ago, The Rex is a live music gem that harks back to those years before the ability to carry every song from every artist from every album ever in your pocket existed. This is a spot to share some great tunes.  Stuck downtown or just wandering around, killing time? Monday to Friday, music starts at 6:30 or so and over the weekend the sets kick off at noon. I can't speak to the food quality yet, but it appears to be standard pub fare and people seemed to enjoy eating it. The atmosphere is familiar and friendly.  I can speak to the quality of music you will hear. Excellent. I've been consistently impressed by the calibre of music performed here. It's a great showcase of the talented musicians living in Toronto. Spots in the back will diminish the sound oh so slightly, but if you came for quiet conversation, move along. Otherwise, grab a seat, have a drink and listen away."}
{"text":"Great place to experience live jazz. For the price, it cannot be beat. Paid a $10 cover on Saturday night and heard a great 6 piece band play. Drinks and food are good and reasonably priced. Will come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Clearly renovated (and work still being done), perfectly located little hotel.  Room was super clean, staff super nice. My only disappointment was that the bar downstairs closes when the music is done, but hey, there were plenty of options within a two block radius.  Would definitely stay here again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night, was not very busy and there was some awesome live jazz music playing at the front. I really enjoyed how the music was not mind-boggling loud. My friends and I could actually have a conversation with each other without screaming which was a huge plus. And I'm no jazz expert by any means but the live music was great! In terms of the ambience, the bar feels super cozy and almost nogalistic. Me gusta.   The food was decent - got the shrimp alfredo special with garlic bread for a bit less than $9 and some chips and salsa for around $4.50 which wasn't anything special but not bad. The drink prices are moderate, around $5-7 for a pint of beer. My friend got the raspberry, white chocolate cheesecake which was delicious! The service was okay, our waiter was super nice but not that attentive (he didn't come around our table until nearly an hour after we finished our meals and didn't check up on us for drinks!). I would probably come here again but not in a rush and probably not before trying out other jazz/blues bars in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Live jazz every night of the week in a no-frills tavern-style setting...oh yeah baby, that's the Rex Hotel. And it's been the undisputed king of this genre for decades in Toronto. Unlike pretty much all of Toronto's jazz venues, the Rex has enjoyed singular longevity...it's managed to survive and thrive over the years where other clubs have gone under.  The scene: CASUAL! I think that's the secret behind their success. Very often, the boisterous talking and laughter of the tavern-style atmosphere competes with the music on-stage, but that seems to be the formula that keeps people--young and old, rich and riff-raff--coming back for more. As in, you can listen or you can chat with your friends, no problem.  What else is unique about the Rex? Early jazz...6:30 every night with no cover charge (but PLEASE tip the artists). Obviously they also have nightly late sets and even mid-day sets on weekends.  As for the music itself, it's a revolving door of some of Canada's finest straight-jazz musicians, but they also mix it up with lots of avant garde offerings, some non-jazz stuff (soul, etc) and they even feature young performers. If you're in Toronto and you like jazz, this is a down-home mainstay that's not to be missed."}
{"text":"I decided to check the establishment out after leaving a nearby jazz lounge, but I was never acknowledged upon entering. I'm saddened because it looks like it could have been a great time, but I guess because the band was finished, the servers decided their shifts would end early too."}
{"text":"There's a reason that this place has been kicking around for as long as it has.  It began in the late 80s as jazz and blues bar and has become a quintessential venue for the Toronto jazz scene, be the Toronto Jazz Festival on or not.  A little bit on the divey side, this does everything to bring out its charm.  When a jazz act hits the stage, or a blues singer serenades with tales of personal woe, you want a place that looks like this is the only place the story could be told.  This would be the Rex then.  During the summer, its patio is available, with doors to the show room open allowing the music from within to bleed out into the street.  The beverages available are as good a range as you'd expect in any bar, but the menu (decent enough) and drinks aside, you go to the Rex for the music.  If you're lucky, you'll get there when Dixieland bands hit the stage. Don't forget to buy merch from the band."}
{"text":"Lovely place for some amazing live jazz and drinks. Stopped by one late afternoon and enjoyed some awesome blues by Dr Nick and the rollercoasters."}
{"text":"A very unique establishment with a jazz bar and restaurant on the bottom floor and a hotel above. The management is friendly as is the bar/restaurant staff. The club consistently has evening shows throughout the week so if you're staying and looking for a quiet place, you may want to keep looking as the music doesn't stop until at least 10-11 pm on weeknights. The rooms are small as others have mentioned, and spartan at that. You'll likely get the feeling of a youth hostel rather than a hotel room. My room did have a TV and private bath, but no phone, or much of anything else you might expect for the money you spend. With that said, I did mention to the manager the rooms could use a deep clean as some \"remnants\" of former tenants were present;  random stains on the walls, some hair here and there, etc.   Nothing that bothered me too much, but I know many who would have requested another room or even another hotel altogether. Location wise you can't really beat it. The Rex is walking distance to just about everything you might want to see, eat, and drink in Toronto. The bus, trolley and subway stops are all within a block, too."}
{"text":"I came for the hotel and stayed for the music and friendly staff.  In my two trips to America's neighbor to the north I have stayed at The Rex. The rooms are very small and cozy. The rooms are the cheapest in the neighboring area, but that's mostly because they're small. I recommend this hotel for people who only use hotel rooms for sleeping , occasionally changing, and bringing back friendly locals . When I visit a new city I like to explore and not waste my time in a room. If you're like me then this is the place for you. The location is perfect for those who want to get around downtown Toronto with ease.  I can't really speak for the food, but the staff offered us toast and something to drink. I just want to say that it was the best  goddamn toast I have had in my life. No joke. The staff is really friendly and offered us free beer and info on local sights to see. Downstairs has a very spacious bar and solid beers on tap. The jazz bands that I've heard through the floor were really good. The soothing music really helps when taking a nice afternoon nap.   My only gripe would be that it is sometimes difficult to get extra towels or sheets at night. Also, the bathrooms are a very tight squeeze. I'm an American I need room for reading and for my fat. Otherwise, check out this place if you're visiting great Toronto or like jazz."}
{"text":"This is a unique hotel, which I like. The unfortunate thing is that if you have a room on the 1st floor, it is right above the bar where I am currently experiencing a ton of bass and sound from the band, even well after midnight. With the volume, I'm assuming the 2nd floor gets a lot of vibration too.  If you need to start early the next day, do not book here. I need to get up at 6 a.m. and the music is so loud and the walls and floors allow way too much sound through that I am barely sleeping. If you are going to be up all night, I'm sure there isn't much of a problem for you. I addressed this issue and the response I got was, \"I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do for you\".  It costs $175 per night, which isn't that bad considering the location with how close things are, but if you can't sleep at night it's not even worth $50. Plus, the rooms are tiny and you share a shower with the ENTIRE floor. There really needs to be a separate yelp page for the hotel apart from the bar, because the average stars for this place is way too high. I'm sure the bar and music (i mean it kept me from sleeping) is great but the hotel part is just terrible.    The only reason I have rated it two stars instead of one star is because I expected the room and the lack of amenities. I booked very late so it was my last choice for staying in close to town.   If I come back to Toronto, i might have a beer here, but I will certainly not even consider staying in this place again."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself while I sat back and listened to the sounds of their talented jazz band. The drummer, bass player, saxophonist, etc. had every cell in my body jumping while I enjoyed a cold drink with friends. Good music along with good company = great times."}
{"text":"Amazing jazz band! Ordered a Sprite at the bar as I don't drink, the bar lady was upset I wanted to pay by card, bad service, but a great place . Really a great place to stop in to see. The food smelt good to, but I didn't eat. Would be good to try and work the friendliness behind the bar.  Might have just been a bad day for her. This place is really 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I only stayed at the hotel. It's in a hip Part of town with lots of little restaurants. I got there late, so had to go to the bar to get my room key, which is no big deal.  There is no traditional front desk or any services like a phone. It is essentially a hostel. The room i was in had a bathroom in it, but I saw there were communal bathrooms, presumably for the other rooms. My room was undecorated. It was clean with a tv and an air conditioner. There is no elevator. I had no problems at this hotel, but it is rather spartan. A place to sleep, clean up and be on your way."}
{"text":"Nice food, reasonably priced. Lovely live music - often without a cover, you just tip the act. Friendly service - good selection of drinks. Veggie choices in the menu. What's not to like. We had a veggie burger and a grilled tofu sandwich - both very reasonably priced around 10 bucks with fries included. Beers on tap for around 6-8 dollars. Dessert was an amazing white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Thanks for a great night out"}
{"text":"It's always kind of incredible to me when I visit a restaurant and the food is, to put it kindly, mediocre. And I'm talking the kind of mediocre where it's clear that the chef simply didn't put any effort into the meal. (It's an entirely different story if the food is bad but ambitious.)  We were walking along Queen and heard some pretty decent music coming from within the Rex, so we decided to sit on the patio and enjoy the band.  The menu is pretty basic, so I went with the burger and fries (to which I added sauteed onions). The food arrived a short time later and...it wasn't the best. The burger consisted of a fairly garden-variety frozen patty that you could easily buy from the supermarket. Actually, it was somehow worse than a supermarket burger, since it was entirely lacking in a beefy flavor. It tasted more like a sausage that had been shaped into a burger patty.  The fries weren't much better, as they were way, way, WAY too greasy. With every bite, I could feel pockets of oily grease exploding in my mouth. And there was even something awry with the ketchup. It was vinegary to an unreasonable extent.  I'm sure the Rex is probably a fine venue for music, but would it kill them to put just a *little* effort into their food?"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because I really liked this place a lot, but given that it's a music spot and the acoustics are horrific, I had to!  I wanted to see a Big Band that was here and so we got in and it was packed.  Fortunately we found a table in the corner.  The service was seriously phenomenal.  With how crowded it was, our waitress was super quick.  The food was pretty solid, nothing spectacular.  The music was LOUD.  I say that because I have been to some venues where you can still talk despite there being live music...this isn't one of them.  The band itself was really good though and I enjoyed it.  I would definitely go back but I'm not sure the building itself makes the music sound as good as it could."}
{"text":"Great location, good music! this is a very affordable place to stay. It's located at the heart of the city. All neighborhoods are at a short walking distance."}
{"text":"The Rex is sort of a Toronto landmark and I have walked past it and peeked in countless times and there always seems to be a solid crowd and some good music at any time of day. I'm actually surprised that I've lived here so long and hadn't been to the Rex until this weekend! I finally went last night when my friend and I were looking for a chill, unpretentious place to have a post-show drink.   I'm not a huge jazz aficionado, but I like some jazz and have been to a few jazz clubs before. It seems like a lot of them (e.g. Opus on Queen West) have closed in the last few years, so it's nice to see The Rex is still going strong. They have at least 3 shows daily, 7 days a week, which is quite impressive! Last night they were having a CD launch of this big band group. Cover was a very reasonable $12 (and on weeknights there is usually no cover). The space is quite large, although tables at the back wouldn't have a great view of the stage so try and find a seat near the entrance.   Drinks are very fairly priced. They have house red/white wine for ~$6/glass. We got some chips & salsa ($4 for a pretty big basket). They have a full menu with typical pub food. Our server was great. She checked in on us periodically, without being too intrusive.   The crowd is really mixed. This place has zero attitude and the vibe is just really relaxed. There were all these cute older couples, as well as some teenagers (I don't think they card people at the door... at least *I* didn't get carded, and I often still do at other places:S).   The decor is pretty retro and they have some cool black & white photos of how the place looked back in the day and some artists who have performed here in the past. They also have some random French impressionist prints. The bathroom was kinda gross by the end of the night, but that unfortunately seems to be the case at most bars.   Definitely a fun option if you are looking for a low-key night out, or really, if you want to hear live jazz any time. Check the website for listings."}
{"text":"Dropped by here after hearing about it from a friend - people have raved about this jazz bar. I was a little irked at first that this place charged cover on a Thursday ($7) - I can get charging for a club, but why in the would would you charge me for entrance to a bar/restaurant? Somewhere I'm going to definitely 100% spend more money on food and drinks? We ended up sitting on the patio, where there was no cover.  We could still hear the live performers on the patio - they were all very good, but they weren't spectacular. The beer pitcher we got, however, was pretty spectacular. I was already pretty tipsy at that point, so I had no idea what we ordered, but it was pretty light and came with orange slices. Very nice, orangey taste. The full pitcher came with tiny cups though, especially for beer. Not sure what they were getting at with the small cups (drink in moderation?). We also ordered the large nachos, which is enough to feed 4. It was mostly chips, and was pretty skimpy on the toppings though.  Solid jazz, and great patio atmosphere. Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"great place for live jazz. the food is ok but the music is always worth the trip. The fact that the bring top players in from NYC often is really nice!"}
{"text":"I was truly looking for a reasonable priced hotel that I can afford and also be near public transportation.  In terms of location, the Rex hotel fits the bill.  Its on the Dowtown entertainment district and near a lot of bars besides offerring its own nightly jazz concerts (bands).    The hotel itsel contains only two floors above the jazz club.  If  you can not walk up stairs, this is not the hotel for you.  Based on photographs and sparse reviews, I didn't know what to expect but also did not think I was going to a chain hotel like Marriot or Hilton.  The room is sparse, remodeled bathroom, no amenities except soap.  With travelling these days requirig minimal amount of toiletries, I wind up buying some cheaper items in a mart in Eaton Centre (several blocks east from the hotel).  Another missing ingredient to my hotel stay was a hair blower and dryer.  To my friends, you know I have thick beautiful long hair envied by all including Tarzan himself!    I am very happy to report that the hotel has ac and I managed to snag the top room but it faced Queen street which made for noisy evenings if your ac is off and the windows open.  My view is of  CN tower which is not bad considering I am staying in downtown entertainment district.  Would I stay here again, on a pinch yes.  I prefer to stay where comfort is simply easy to access.  Was the stay bad?  No, I enjoyed finding a 24 hr market across the street for the cool water and drinks and snacks before going to bed.  Was the area safe, true as most cities can be safe.    For you couples travelling without your hmmm necessities, there is a Condom Shack store across the street for your nightly ribbed or unribbed pleasure.  Rex Hotel you are not perfect but you will do!    P.S.  apparently when my room gets cleaned, my card for the door is not working as well so I have to go downstairs to rekey (not inconvenient since they are open late (mybe even 24 hrs)."}
{"text":"Nice place to be.me and my wife came here for \"blues\" and we enjoyed! The prices are nice. We ordered beer poutine which was fairly good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I do agree that this place is authentic , however they need a major upgrade. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and the fan looks like it's going to fly off! Also on hot days they need to install an A/C system.  It's way too hot in there.  Out of the vocals I have heard I really enjoy Justin Bacchus (http://justinbacchus.com/) He's there quite often and I think he has a killer voice.   When I was there on Sat afternoon I was not soo keen on the band.  It was a female singer and the band was not only off tune but also overpowering, so you wouldn't hear the vocals.   There is a cover charge at night - I believe it's $10.   I will be back eventually - staff are always friendly. I didn't know this place was also a hotel! :S  I don't think I would rent a room here."}
{"text":"TL;DR: don't order the food, don't put your room key near your phone, it's pricey for what it is, but it's close to stuff. I was optimistic of this hotel after reading such great reviews, but I was displeased. The price for the room is too high. The only reason I was ok with the price is because it's 10 mins from the Eaton centre. I got a room with a private bathroom, and the room is quite small, which is fine, but the price is too high.  Furthermore, we had issues with our key because our phones apparently decoded it. After a day full day of walking, it was a little frustrating.  To get ice, you have to go outside, into the bar, and ask for a pitcher of ice. We got food from the bar to take back to the room and it was such a disappointment. I asked if everything was in the bag and the waitress assured us we had everything. Upon getting to the room (after dropping it because it wasn't actually tied), I realized I didn't have any salad dressing, the club was on white bread instead of brown like I asked, the roast beef sandwich had no sauce and was so dry. If you're looking for a place to just lay your head and don't mind the price, then it's decent."}
{"text":"How unfortunate - I have to write a bad review! BUT: Bear in mind, this is for the hotel and NOT the tavern.  The Jazz and Blues Bar really intrigued me, so we booked a night in the hotel upstairs. We had an event to attend at Roy Thompson Hall, which is a very short jaunt down the street, and this seemed convenient. Considering that this is the 3rd establishment we have stayed at since November for this series, we have come to have higher expectations than this hotel could offer, simply because they charged more than the others did. I still don't know the history of this old rickety place, but it certainly did not meet the bar, and let me tell you why:  The other 2 places we stayed at charged around $75 or $80 bucks a night; this one charged about $120 - and this is through the internet (ie: hotwire or hotel.com or something like that; it should have been much cheaper!), So, we decided to try it once because it was so nice and close to RTH. And my hubby is a nice guy who knows I like jazz and blues. However, there is no reception area for the hotel - you have to go into the tavern to check in and get your room key. There's no security leading to the rooms. None whatsoever. And the door to the street is unlocked. That's not so good, but ok. So I go up to the room to check it out - \"up\" meaning 2 floors up, and take the stairs (no elevators). I can live with that - I need the exercize. However, the hallways and rickety wooden staircase smell like cigarettes (it's supposed to be no smoking). Stairway walls are covered in '80's style artsy band photos and other posters. Then you get into the hallway where our room is located.... not nice! The carpet is threadbare and buckled, worn out in places. Very definitely a rooming house atmosphere. One door was open so I peeked in: it was a toilet, which alarmed me - I wondered if this place has toilets or bathrooms in the rooms. The next open door was a full bathroom - toilet, sink, and bathtub. Now I'm really alarmed! Finally made it to our room and.... oh my gosh. :-( I have never ever seen such a tiny room anywhere! The spare bedrooms in my house are larger than this. No carpet here, just hardwood. The room is JUST big enough to hold a double bed and a night stand on either side. TV is mounted on the ceiling overhead in a corner. Yes, there is free wifi... if you trust it! And YES, there was a bathroom in the room. BUT it was so small, you didn't have room to turn around in it! Hard to dry off after a shower. No tub, but a modern glass enclosure. Unfortunately, there has obviously been some water leakage in there, as it smelled moldy. Not happy campers, I'm afraid!   After the show at RTH, we considered giving a listen to the music in the Tavern at the Rex. However, I misread the info on the sheet in our room: although the tavern offers 2 shows a day during the week, they offer 4 shows on weekends. And the only show where they charge a cover charge is the 9:30pm show, which is when we were there: $10 each. I'm sorry, but this place is a dive! If customers of the hotel got in free or at least a discount, that would be something, but oh no! Pay to get in; Pay for your drinks, and so on! Oddly, there was a Yelp coupon for a discount in the bar. Ok, I can't help but laugh; that's too little, too late. Sorry...  My husband, dear sweet soul that he is, said the only good thing he could think of: at least the bedsheets were clean! (Me grumbling further: but the bed was too hard, and the pillows too soft!) Worse, and on top of all that: our room faced Queen Street (and the \"Condom Shack\"!!) The streetcars go all night long; I had a lousy sleep.  And there's no street or on-site parking; you \"get\" to park in the lot up the street for about $20 for a 24 hour period. It was $6 overnight until 6:00am. Yes, we left just before 6:00! The rest of the visit to Toronto went very much better."}
{"text":"Will update later. Bar appears classy and elegant so far. Ambient noise is probably average for a pub but in my opinion, a little too loud. The music is just a bit louder than the talking. Will do a more thorough review soon."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast for a decent price! Friendly service and excellent live music! Always a great time at the Rex!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice despite the fact that I love jazz and live around the corner (for now).  And both times Jon M of Yelp fame was playing.  I can honestly say that from what I've experienced and heard while riding by the music is great.    The drinks are pretty bad.  I've had three different mixed drinks (the easiest kinds, like a gin and tonic) and they were all bad.  Warm, with machine ice melting quickly in them, a lime that is impossible to manage, etc.  They didn't taste good...in fact they tasted somehow wrong.  Just poor craft on making drinks.    The environment is rather stale; not comfortable nor pleasant to look at, but not torturous either. Good enough, but definitely in the \"dive bar\" category. The location of the stage makes only certain seats good for seeing the band that's playing, so choose your seat wisely.    I really wish they could raise the quality of the rest of this place to match the quality of the performers.  I'd certainly go here more.  I won't ever come here to drink, that's for sure.  Maybe I'll try the food next time.    In conclusion, this place is a \"jazz bar\"...it gets 5 stars on the jazz and 1 star on the bar."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY REX HOTEL JAZZ & BLUES BAR? We're visiting from NYC, came to The Rex Hotel Jazz & Blues Bar tonight early to hear a piano player, we sat right up front by the stage. As soon as we sat, I noticed a tip jar on stage, gave hubs some $$ which he put in, then sat back to enjoy some drinks & an appetizer. We politely & respectfully watched, didn't talk, stare at our phones, etc. It was wonderful to relax as we had been out sightseeing all day. We paid our check, left a nice tip, waited until the piano player was finished with his song, and then quickly & quietly got up to leave. Immediately, upon seeing us,  the piano player VERY LOUDLY  on his microphone told us to \"hit the tip jar\".  Everyone stopped to stare at us. I smiled and said \"We already did\". He started calling me names(again, loudly on his microphone)  It was mortifying, uncalled for and juvenile.  From the sidewalk and down the block from The Rex, we could hear the piano player, LOUDLY on his microphone, calling us names. SERIOUSLY Rex? So disappointing and unprofessional. We'll take our business elsewhere, I will be reposting this to other travel reviews as well.  9/28/2017 @RexHotelToronto"}
{"text":"First dive bar I've gone to ever, had an amazing experience, great live bands, would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Best place to go for live music! If you arrive before 7 you have a better chance of getting a seat close to the stage. If you arrive after 9 on the weekend you will probably have to pay for cover and might be standing. Their food is not the best but this place is not known for it's food. It's a great date night if you enjoy music. The bands are quite good here."}
{"text":"What a blast! Great live R&B music, top notch burger and cold beer. Very comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere for lovers of live music!"}
{"text":"Nachos are so so..fairly plain. That's all we had for food..so I'm not sure if it's representative of other food on the menu. Authentic feeling place.. \"Well used\" is the theme..but I like it. Feels unpretentious. Music is amazing..of course!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch live jazz! It's old and dingy, but the sound is great and the bands they bring in are very good. There are cover charges here and they vary from free to $20 and more (depending on who is playing)  The food and drink menu is nothing special but the service is cheerful and friendly. The crowd is older and dress code is very casual. I had heard about this place for years and finally went last Saturday night. If you sit in the back you can still hear the bands but it is a little quieter if you want to talk with your party. I am giving this place 4 stars for the entertainment value but 3 stars for the food and drink menu (a great option would be to have dinner somewhere else on Queen then come here for a drink or two (this is what we did and it made for a very enjoyable night)"}
{"text":"The Rex is a very low key and laid back place for jazz and music lovers in the city.  Dropped by on a Friday afternoon for a few drinks and to see a friend's band play.  The place was pretty busy.  Sight lines of the stage are kinda awful with random columns blocking the view.  And they have no AC.  I just about shriveled and died from the heat.  Good choice of beers on tap with pints ranging between $6-$8.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"There's something nostalgic about this place. It reminds me of an old pub. Casual, fun. The jazz performers are stellar and always comprises of great variety of jazz music from solo to quartet.... Sax to piano. Come early to get seats though."}
{"text":"We loved the afternoon jazz so much we went back for the evening show.  The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon but there was no cover, though the donation bucket is passed round close to the end of the set, and lots of choices for draught beer.   With a 4 piece band and vocalist the traditional jazz was amazing! We came back in the evening just at the end of Justin Bacchus set. He, and his band, were fabulous. They played modern music with a great jazz twist. The main highlight was Brian D's Rythmn Method. There was a $12 cover per person for this performance and it was standing room only. Though this was not our favourite style of jazz you could not help be in awe of the talent.   So great to see a venue with so many artists! Check out their calendar and be sure to pop in for a drink if you are in T.O."}
{"text":"This review is for the hotel and not the bar.  So you're heading to downtown Toronto. Avoid the Rex Hotel if at all possible. At $110/night, the cost is low, but the hotel is way below usual standards. Start with the filthy carpeting and smelly hallways, then arrive at a tiny room with a 20\" flat screen TV. Pictures on the hotel's web site show a woman in a bathrobe standing in the corner of the room. I wish we had that much floor space, but had to stack our luggage to have room to walk around the bed. No closet, just a 8\" bar with a couple of hangers for your clothes. When someone is in the shower, don't go in the tiny bathroom because you will be sprayed by the floor drain. No phone, no clock, no pool, no ironing board, no ice bucket, but you do get two small bars of soap. I put my camera bag on the floor and then spent minutes brushing off the dust from the floor.  The only good thing about the hotel is live music in the bar downstairs. Rather than go to the cramped room after dinner we tried to sit at the bar for a little. No way, even though we were hotlel guests we had to leave or pay a cover charge. If your room is on the first floor you get to hear the music free with no charge, but be sure to bring earplugs if you want to sleep before 1:00 AM due to the noise. You could get a room on the third floor facing Queen St. and then you only have to live with traffic noise and sirens. Overall, abysmal, dirty, tiny, overpriced, noisy, and unacceptable. We moved a few blocks away to the Marriot for $39 more and were delighted with the location and the amenities. Don't waste your time and money on the Rex Hotel."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the live music that was described as 'jazz'. Self indulgent remakes of Bobby Brown's Every Little Step I Take and Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes is far from what I call jazz! Awful, just awful. Very few redeeming qualities for this iconic live music venue."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Jazz and Blues Bar. Based on last night's visit I recommend this place for anyone that enjoys live jazz or blues. The bar patrons are really an audience -- meaning that everyone (except those sitting and chatting away in the back room) are really there to LISTEN to and enjoy the music and thus are very attentive (minimal conversation).  It is not pretentious or expensive -- very much a pub feel. Fairly large room, music carries well -- even to the outdoor sidewalk sitting (when the door is open in the summer). Pub food, decent selection of beers, busy but responsive staff, friendly crowd."}
{"text":"Always a good jazzy time, always nice to hear some locals over a whiskey sour. Not a lot of room at the front, slightly cramped but can win them all. Still managed to slow dance with my boyfriend. Now at Christmas John MacLeod and the Rex 22 Piece Band are FANTASTIC! Last Monday of the month at 7 is when he shows."}
{"text":"Several colleagues and I came here looking to shed off the fatigue of a long work day. It is a friendly, intimate pub with fantastic, live jazz music.  This is one of the best jazz bars I've been to. The players are passionate, and I appreciate that they write and perform their own music. They are a mix of young professionals who's passion can be seen in their music. They literally dance while they play and make you want to get up and jive.  After the band plays, they offer the stage to people in attendance. A bunch of young kids from high school got up and played some numbers after- they were great. Its fantastic to see such inspiration in this tiny pub, puts you in a good mood for the rest of the night.  Their beer selection is extremely limited. Although they do serve all the major brands (Bud, Heineken, Stella...). They don't do cocktails either, so don't count on it."}
{"text":"Good music most of the time but they could do more with the food and drink selection"}
{"text":"I like this place! REALLY LOUD THOUGH... what a terrible place for a \"long time no see\" date!  I had the chips and salsa $4, it was sooooooo goooodd. I love salsa! It was quite spicy too... zomg it was just perfect  Service was quick. Atmosphere... hmm... it was brightly lit, packed, music was very very loud, and it looked like a... dorm common room. That was my impression!  I still think it's a fun place to be.  6:30pm, Friday. We didn't pay cover and there was no lineup. We got the last table too..."}
{"text":"The food is not exactly the greatest but their drinks are decently priced.  The patio and the live bands make up for the sub-par food."}
