{"text":"Do your belly a favour and run, don't walk, run to Main Street Burger and order one of their burgers! My recommendation and all time favourite is their Smokestack burger with chips and gravy. The Smokestack patties are smoked before being pressed on the grill for a flavour punch with each bite. I load mine with the usual array of condiments including sautéed jalapeños. I also highly recommend their homemade chips...their fries are yum but the chips are frickin awesome! They're so good, they often sell out if you get there too late in the day. Dip the chips in their house gravy and thank me later...

Main Street Burger is a hidden gem that is surrounded by a car wash on one side and a pub on the other...and can easily be missed if you're not paying attention. Once you find it, you'll be glad to be one of the lucky ones..."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great burger fried and chips. But the brisket sandwich is what made my day. With the BBQ sauce it was just sooo good. Overall my mouth was faster than my brain so before I knew it there wasn't much left for pictures"}
{"text":"Best burger I've eaten.... DOA is the one I highly recommend, pulled pork, 3 patties, 3 cheeses and 3 pieces of bacon . Very fresh, the meat comes out in a ball, pressed and seasoned on the grill. BBQ sauce on the pulled pork is awesome. Have to try."}
{"text":"Tried their smoked patty today ($0.50 extra) in my small burger. I thought it was drier than the regular patty although it was still flavourful. It was a good burger anyway as always. Had their sauce of the week - peppercorn brandy BBQ sauce. 

Grilled chicken burger is now part of their regular burger. Moist but a little over-seasoned! 

Economy's changed. Sautéed mushroom, sautéed onions (and one more item which I can't recall) topping now cost 25 cents."}
{"text":"My go to burger joint. Burgers are delicious!

However, there are times when we find the store closed or opens later than indicated (they do post a sign but still.....)"}
{"text":"Love the burgers here. I go here almost every Saturday and it has been consistently good. The fries are good too. They use local Stouffville potatoes. 

I do wish they will offer some additional stuff like Cajun Fries or some juicy hotdogs but overall, best burger place you can find around the area."}
{"text":"Smoked options are a must. (The regular burger is a bit ordinary/common).
Brisket is good, a bit sweet. 
Staff are polite - sounds like they have a loyal following, by the way they interacted with other customers.

I'm not much of a burger fan to begin with, to be honest. Nothing bad to say, just not inclined to return."}
{"text":"Craving a good burger lately and we found ourselves in Stouffville checking out some real estate when we came upon this little gem. Very tasty,  lots of options,  had their smoke house burger which was amazing. Girlfriend made her own from a great list of toppings and really liked as well. Fries were a bit dark for my liking but gf loved them. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is due to the seating if you eat in,  but as for the food. Great place will definitely return"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience here but I didn't find the burger to be good at all. It's nice that it's cooked to order and the toppings are great, but I had several pieces of gristle/cartilage in my burger that just completely turned me off. I wouldn't return of my own accord but would maybe try the veggie burger or the poutine if a friend really wanted to go. If you're in Toronto, go to the burger's priest for the BEST burger."}
{"text":"This place is craaaazy good, the burgers fresh , the place is clean and people are great.  The pouting has a wicked smokey flavored gravy that is to die for.  Try out this place the twin bothers make an awsome burger"}
{"text":"Makes the best burger in north GTA.  Their poutine is great.  Place is a little small so i usually get takeout."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's my go-to place for an authentic beefy burger. The add-ons are great (pulled pork? brisket? fried egg? yes please!) and the quality is consistently good. We always call ahead and order to-go so there's never any wait. The burgers are made fresh and are delicious. Fries are great too. Thanks for coming to Stouffville!"}
{"text":"If they cared about their customers maybe it could rate higher...

Went by here at 11am, their posted opening hours with my 4yr old son to get a bite and was told they were not open. I cited their hours posted, and was told they were not ready. We waited...

The cashier just went back to her cell. About 10 minutes later the cook told her he was ready, so she took our order. 

I went to the bathroom, the trash bin was overflowing so it was obvious that it was missed on the closing, so I then looked and the floor of the restaurant was not swept or cleaned either, leaving me to wonder what the conditions of the kitchen may be like.

We sat, the cashier played with her phone eventually out order came up, and although we were the only customers in the place, she placed it on the counter and called me over to pick it up. (Not that I was expecting table service, but based on nobody being there and the fact we waited, she could have brought us out food) 

Immediately after, the cashier grabbed a seat in the window seats and continued to play with her phone while we dined.  

I was appalled by the cleanliness and the level of service, and the fact they didn't even want to serve us despite posted hours citing they were supposed to be open and ready for business. 

Every Wednesday I take my son for lunch after his skating lessons (2 ten week courses) and have never given this place a second chance due to this experience. Likely will never visit again. If you want a terrible experience grabbing a mediocre burger, go for it, but expect mediocrity and terrible service, I have found better places in town to spend my money."}
{"text":"A girl from Toronto and hungry after a great golf round. 

Boyfriend and I decided to see what was good in the north. We came across The Lion and pulled in for a drink and tried the spinach and artichoke dip. That is a whole new story but long story short \"The chips are suppose to taste stale\". I jumped on my handy yelp and saw this place, which was right next door. We walked in and everyone was enjoying the jays games and cheering together. What a great atmosphere. I got a small burger (1 patty) with provolone cheese and bacon. Two words. LIFE CHANGING. What a great burger. The Nguyen brothers really know what they are doing. From their fresh well-seasoned patty to their outstanding sauces. Just amazing. I have tried all \"the\" burger joints. Burger priest, shake shack, P&L, Holy Chuck, The Burger Shack, and Five Guys. This is the best burger. I am so happy that I found this place. Will be back when I'm around for golf. 

Happy belly!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a real burger. I find in general there's a lot of great restaurants in Stouffville and I have made it a goal to try them all (almost there). This is one I keep coming back to especially for Fat Fridays (my cheat day), and I like to go all out with burger and poutine, this is a true homemade burger that is fresh and made to order. You get it just how you want it. Its messy, juicy and delicious. It is a small place that is hard to find, and you will most likely drive by a couple of times before you find it hidden in the corner of a building (Lions and Car cleaner). Once you enter the doors the smell of BBQ, bacon and fresh made fries will hit you with a bang and your senses will be overwhelmed and confused as to what to order, it helps the menu is small and simple. As for the condiments - in this case Less is More and you should keep it simple to really get all the flavours."}
{"text":"Burgers are great but the service is lacking. Tonight we showed up 5 mins before closing and they were already locked up and cleaning. As my 4 kids stared into the window they didn't even have the decency to open up and explain themselves. Also, they refuse to look ahead of the line and start cooking burgers for customers that are about to or have just ordered. Be prepared for a long wait. I normally wouldn't post a negative review for anyone ( this is my first post ever ) but tonight was a total disappointment. I live 3 mins away and have eaten there many times but I'm going to rethink my purchases based on the service I received."}
{"text":"This is the place to grab an outstanding burger or anything with brisket. It's pretty easy to miss but it is behind The Lion and next to a car wash. The location is kinda small and the ambiance a little wanting so take it at face value. The staff could really make this a 5 star place if they turned up the friendly-o-meter... The food is what you really come here for and it does not disappoint. They consistently turn out great burgers with awesome toppings and sauces. The brisket sandwich brings me back every time and the brisket poutine is a treat to be indulged sparingly."}
{"text":"It's the kind of burger you can't find anywhere else. The kind of burger you'll miss. The kind of burger you look forward to making your day better when you've had a bad time. The kind of burger that you dry your tears with, holding it in your shaking palms, knowing that when you finish it, you're gonna feel better. The kind of burger that you want to eat again and again, replacing each meal because everything else tastes like disappointment, bland, artificial and never good enough. The kind of burger that helped you through each day like a smile and milk and honey, the kind that made you feel okay, made you feel warm, instead of gross and stale. The kind that cured your depression. 

The kind that made you so helpless now that it's no longer within your reach. You'll miss it so much knowing that you'll never find another one like it. 

The kind you wish everyone who could get one to get one immediately, because you know it's gonna make them so happy, while you are so hopelessly sad not to able to have another one again. 

But it's okay, you're happy enough to have tried it once. And it was the best you've ever had. And probably, the best you will ever have, cherish it."}
{"text":"Brisket was awesome. Highly recommend.
Note that it doesn't come with any sides. Price is a little on the high for burgers but quality is worth it. Get extra toppings."}
{"text":"found this place through a yelp email on stouffville. I tried red bulb espresso right after which was also recommended on the email. Two great recommendations just minutes apart.

got the burger with the brisket and thoroughly enjoyed it. Burgers were fresh while the brisket added a nice bbq flavor to it. Not much to complain about. My wife had the burger with the bacon and for some reason really liked the bacon on it saying that it had a great smoked flavor. Fries were good too."}
{"text":"The absolute best burger I have EVER had worldwide. The patty is insanely tastey, the bun is delicious and by far the hangover burger is their best choice. I've eaten at Au Cheval in Chicago.. claimed the \"best burger in America\"... Main Street tops them!"}
{"text":"Heard of this place because of my friend who lives around the area. Average price for burger is $10 except the one with 3 patties that is $15+. Burger is big like other gourmet burger store but I found the pattie is a bit dry or maybe a little over-cooked. I also order a poutine and it's a bit small to my opinion but the fries is good thou."}
{"text":"WOW. Yet another incredible MEAT-ing of the Yelp GTA Burger Brigade occurred here last night and it certainly did not disappoint! 

I arrived a few minutes early to scope out the joint and grab seating, a word to the wise, this isn't a HUGE sit down place, but they do offer about 10-14 seats with table space and about 4-5 bar stools by the window. If going during busy times, be sure to plan accordingly.

The burger options aren't overwhelming so a decision shouldn't be that hard to come by but the smoked ingredients included in the Smokestack sounded too delicious to not try. Other options were basic burgers in small or regular, a burger called the hangover and another named the Canadian.

The burgers are made to order so they take a couple extra minutes to make. They're cooked on a flat top and pressed a little thicker than your average burger. Cooked to a crumbly meaty perfection. My burger was amazing and cooked through, I think I might even make a special request next time to see if they'll cook it a little less as I tend to be a medium burger kinda guy (don't judge).

For sides they offer the burger joint standards (fries, fries w/ gravy, and Poutine). I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries but the poutine made up for it in my mind - then again I'm kinda off fries right now, so you'll probably love 'em!

The x-factor here was their made to order potato chips. TO. DIE. FOR. Sliced fresh and deep fried so that they are still warm and lightly seasoned when they hit your table. No one else is offering this as a side option at the moment and between that and the burgers Main Street has found a way to set themselves apart!

To drink they also carry a line of Soda Pops that are a bit more \"gourmet\" if you will, including a flash back to my childhood - Dad's Root beer! Yumm!

Great Burger joint - totally worth the trek to Stouffville!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We tried the Canadian and the Smokestack. The Smokestack was not properly cooked and the sweet potato fries had regular fries mixed in. Not impressed ... won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burger joint tucked away on Main Street. The Smokestack is my favourite burger to get from there. Always get the poutine because they use real cheese curds and the real deal gravy. Prices are good for the quality of food. Boutique burger places charge north of $10 these days for a burger but I do not have to drive downtown to get one. Burger combination are endless depending on how imaginative you are. For $15 you are stuffed and wished you didn't order such a massive burger. My whole family likes that place. The staff are friendly and courteous. The place is clean and small, it's mostly a take out joint. The only thing I don't like is they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Wow - I didn't see this one coming at all... what a kick ass burger! Easily my favourite \"fast food\" burger in the GTA (as opposed to the ultimate gourmet burger at the Harbord Room). 

I had the pleasure of trying the Smokestack Burger - two huge patties, two strips of bacon and two slices of cheese. This thing was packed with flavour - talk about a kick in the head. The beef was tender, juicy, not overcooked and had a slight BBQ after taste. Perfect ratio of cheese / Bacon to meat. 

I was stuffed after eating this monster. Folks with an average appetite should stick to the one patty options. 

The fries were also above average. They come in small or regular but the regular should be called a large, it's huge. Not to greasy... just right. I tasted my friends poutine and it was exceptional. The gravy had a nice BBQ flavour that worked perfectly.     

Only negative was the seating situation. Only a couple tables and bar stools, If your going to make the trip, it would be nice to eat there. I had to get my food to go. 

What a pleasant surprise. Fast food burgers and fries done to perfection. Sure it's out of the way... but so worth the trip.

{"text":"Burger Brigade Time has come again!

It was a little bit of a trek but taking the back roads made for one amazing beautiful scenic country drive from Vaughan to Stouffville. 

I'm gonna call this your classic burger joint. It has a few tables inside and some outside seating, bar style seating by the outside wall (windows) and all around one service counter ready with a cook top to make your burger and fries to order.

I was not overly hungry and wanted to try the fries and not feel super coma-stuffed, so I started with my base - Small Burger (one patty)

I choose my Bacon and Cheese and toppings. Bacon and Cheese come in different styles and varieties, they cost extra. The toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, jalapenos, etc) are free and you can add them all on if you want. 

Then to finish it off with your favorite sauces. I chose dijon mustard, ketchup and bbq sauce. Finger licking good!

Our table shared fries, poutine and their signature homemade chips. So delish! The chips were thin, crispy and lightly salted to perfection... and still warm! Our new hawaiian visitor kept nudging me to eat them until they were gone, So i did! :)

Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer was a treat to wash down all these delightfully tasty wonders. 

I like how neat and clean the counters were, the staff were super friendly and I drove back home very satisfied.  

Thanks Main Street Burger Shoppe!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good burger, not incredible, quite pricy. The shop is really clean and I thought that was respectable. The smokehouse is a 10.00 burger for 2 patties and toppings."}
{"text":"This place makes one of the best burgers in the GTA, they also, unfortunately, employ, possibly, the shittiest cashier I've ever come across.  Everytime she has the same miserable, annoyed look on her face.  I'd go here more if she didn't work there because the burgers are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"After 3+ years of living in Stouffville I FINALLY tried this place.  I heard so many good things that I went in with high expectations.  And I was not disappointed!

The burger patties themselves are delicious and juicy.  They have a great beef flavour (instead of that artificial flavour you get in other fast food restaurants).  They also have an amazing peppery kick.  I'm a huge fan of black pepper and it's quite evident in these burgers.

A yellow sesame seed bun is used, which is my favourite.  It's not too thick to take away from the burger and not too thin to keep all of the delicious juices and flavour in.

I love the variety of toppings that are offered.  Quality toppings can make or break a burger and they definitely help make these burgers great!  I haven't tried the fried egg yet but I'm definitely intrigued!

Finally, the fries help top off the meal.  They're perfectly lightly browned and topped with sea salt.  Delicious!

Overall, quality food and definitely the best in the area!  I've been won over and will definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"My son and I tried the Canadian Burger and it was one of the best burgers we've ever had, top 5 easy. Perfect bun, thin but strong enough to keep all the yummy goodness together. Toppings were super fresh and the lettuce nicely chopped \"julienne like\" to keep the peace with the tomatoes, pickles, pemeal bacon and juicy beef. WOW!

A really tasty burgerWell done!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were absolutely amazing. It was a far drive for us, but totally worth it. I got the Canadian burger and my boyfriend got the hangover. We both loved our burgers so much we were unwilling to share! Every bite until the last was absolutely perfect. The bread didn't get soggy, and the proportion from the patty to the toppings to the bread was exactly the right amount. We also got the poutine which was delicious. Perfect amount of gravy so the fries weren't soggy. I highly recommend this burger joint. We were full but not disgustingly full. The place was also clean and well decorated. Staff were also so friendly and professional. Def stop by even if you're not in the area!"}
{"text":"Very slow to order.   First walked in with high expectations and was told there would be a 25 minute wait for food.  

I was confused seeing a table of 3 and a couple at front waiting for take out.  So I ordered anyway and watched as the two cooks would work on one order at a time and stand waiting and watching the burgers cook? Huh? 
As others walked in they were told 45 minute wait.  I don't understand the whole system here or if there is secret burger rule that one order at a time can be cooked.  

Large grill- check, two cooks- check, lots of food available- check.  Seems legit.  

So this mystery is tough to solve!!  

Sorry for the long review, I have a lot of spare time while I wait for my order.  

I  am looking forward to tasting the food."}
{"text":"Great, definitely  go back !  I  only  got  one  patty , I  would  definitely  recommend  getting  two."}
{"text":"5 stars for by far the best burger in Stouffville. In fact this burger joint is one of the best in York Region as far as I'm concerned.

I love other burger places like Burger's Priest but for me the quality and price at MSBS are great. If you were treating to my choice of burger I'd probably pick Burger's Priest. But for my own money MSBS is the place. Also conveniently located in my hometown.

I personally love the Smokestack burger. If you aren't a big fan of smokiness then I wouldn't recommend. The smoked cheese and bacon on this burger are great. I recommend adding mushrooms as well.

The interior here is very small, so if its busy I'd recommend you take your food to go.

All in all, it doesn;t get much better for a great burger and fantastic fries. MSBS is in the group of the very best food you can get in the Stouffville area and for sure the best burger in town."}
{"text":"Revising my review as this burger place deserves more stars. Their prices are great! And their burgers are unbelievably tasty! They didn't taste salty at all.

I always get my small 4 oz burger and I tried their smoked cheddar. Really good! Service is fast as well. Today we tried their new onion rings, and it is definitely a must-try. Really geat overall!

This is my go-to for burger when I am in the area. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for burgers
Solid eats

The Smokestack is my fav burger

When I am not feeling a burg.....I go for the brisket sandwich

Watch out for lunchtime on weekends
This place gets crazy busy then"}
{"text":"My fav burger place this side of town. Call ahead cuz the wait could be long. 

Best bets: poutine with beef brisket
Beef brisket sandwich, hamburger with beef brisket. 

Yes, I do notice a pattern...."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try and had the hangover burger and man it was good, fried egg really makes this burger juicy and tasty.  Their patties are made themselves which is a welcome thing in the glut of markham burger chains that don't really do a patty well.  Extras are not over the top expensive to add to your burger either.

The one negative thing I have to say is the fries I got were fried with some old oil making half the batch of fries I got inedible as they look black and brown....  I'm not totally a fan of their gravy either but overall I'd definitely come back next time to try a few more things."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. However it's a very small place with little or next to no seating. I think I'll order take-out next time."}
{"text":"There's not much to say except, always fresh and always amazing, never been disappointed with service or the food. Good price too especially for the quality of food. It's hidden behind top gear car wash across from no frills. Come here and wow your tastebuds."}
{"text":"This place almost got 5 stars. The food definitely deserves a five. The quality of the meat and the toppings and care put into the food here is excellent. The best part about it is they don't charge you extra for premium toppings such as sauteed mushrooms or onions, where most gourmet burger joints do. They lost a star due to the fact they hired a rude girl to man the cash. Every time I go in, she never smiles, rushes the order, and looks like she would rather be somewhere else. 

I mostly always get The Hangover. Two beef patties with a fried egg on top with toppings galore. My fiance tried the D.O.A (Death On Arrival) once, it has three beef patties, bacon and pulled pork. It was a little too much he said, and now he enjoys The Hangover as well. 

Their poutine is really good too. You can add any of their meats into the poutine such as pulled pork or beef brisket. The brisket was a bit too salt but the pulled pork was amazing. The fries on their own are fantastic as well.
 
Overall, 4.5. Get rid of the gir at cash, and they get a 5!"}
{"text":"Best burger place for sure, food consistency is very good!

Been going for about 2 years now."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Stouffville. All burgers are made fresh. As in the burgers are hand rolled and pressed to order. They're just meat balls before you order. They'll do a lettuce wrap and they have lots of free toppings. 

It's hidden beside the lion pub and car wash but great spot for a good burger in Stouffville. 

Wish they'd add sweet potato fries and had longer hours."}
{"text":"THE best place for burgers, pulled pork and brisket! Great food for amazing prices! They use the local butcher for their meat and you can taste the difference using quality products make! I can't say enough good things about out town's burger spot! Keep up the good work! You are doing everything right!"}
{"text":"I  found this gem of a burger place from tadaaaaa ..... YELP , of course.  It was one of those reviews I bookmarked in the morning while I was lazily reading on my bed,  and 4 hours later savouring their juicy,  moist patties.  
I ordered the hangover,  as I wasn't sure what to try.  The couple before us looked like regulars and ordered it,  so I did the same.  Boy am I glad I did.  I had it with mushrooms, onions, tomato, relish,  barbecue sauce and hot sauce topped with fried egg. I was in burger heaven.  And it doesn't end there,  I still had the poutine with pulled pork to conquer. It was so good,  gravy had the right consistency and saltiness , and the sweetness of the pulled pork gives a nice balance.  I can't wait to try other poutine with the beef brisket. 
It is a bit of a drive for me,  but with food this good,  I don't mind coming back.  Btw,  I already did,  I went back the second time last Sunday,  and they were closed  maybe because of Canada Day.  Oh well,  I will try again later."}
{"text":"This place is great. Came in one day after playing a round of golf in the area. I ordered a double party burger with cheddar and bacon along with a poutine. It was a little bit expensive for all of this together but not outside of what other burger shops in Toronto would charge. The food was great. Everyone I was with really enjoyed their burgers. The Canadian burger was a popular choice. The double burger and the poutine was a lot of food. I would probably just get a small fries next time or share the poutine. 

Also, if you check in on Yelp you get a coupon for a $5 double bacon cheeseburger. I didn't find this out until afterward so I'll save that for next time. I'll definitely be back if in the area.

PS: it's easy to miss from the street."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Homemade feel. Unfortunately the girl at the cashier is brutally unfriendly. I will not be going back due to that."}
{"text":"I came to Main Street Burger for a CMYE Burger Brigade.  I admit that I am an easy-to-please burger eater.  I like burger with big moist patty, nice sauce in toasted bun.  As long as these 3 components are well done, it is a home run.  So you guess it, Main Street Burger gets a home run.  I ordered the Hangover Burger ($9.50).  Then I chose the toppings and the sauces.  I love, love, love, love the special BBQ sauce here.  Highly recommend.  The meat was thick, and its texture was easy to chew through.  The toasted bun was soft.  I nibbled on freshly made potato chips, poutine and fries, courtesy of our CM Kris.  The potato chips were really thin and crunchy, totally addictive.  It was a crowd pleaser.  Check out the pic; it tastes as good as it looks.  The poutine and fries were tasty, too."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger places I've been to. Although I liked the Smokestack and the pulled pork sandwich, nothing beats the DOA. It's huge and sometimes seems impossible to finish, but it's one of the best burger I've ever had...like, ever. 
Everything I've had there, from the burgers, bread, fries, toppings....everything tastes super fresh."}
{"text":"I'm not in the Stouffville area much, but when I am I know where I'll be going when hungry... and you know even not too hungry.

Place is a little difficult to find as it is in the back of another restaurant so be sure you know what you are looking for.  I drove past it twice...

Great burger, cooked right around medium well.  Still juicy but not at all messy.  The bun was so fresh. I had the Smokestack which includes bacon.  Their bacon is awesome, usually when I get bacon on a burger you can almost forget its there.  No so here you get plenty of maple bacon flavor.

Fries were pretty good, better than average.  However the plastic forks they provide seldom get past the crispness of the fries so you gots to eatem by hand.. only a small nit to pick there."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would enjoy the food here so much but I was giggling like a little school girl while eating. The smokestack burger actually had a smoky taste to it which impressed me. The beef patties themselves were thin but juicy and when combined with the sesame bun and veggie toppings of your choice it made for a perfect burger at $9.50

The poutine with pulled pork was just as impressive. Just the right amount of gravy, cheese and meat. $5.99 for the poutine itself and an extra $1.75 for the pulled pork. 

To wash everything down got an old fashion bottle of root beer for $2.25

I'm happy that this place is just far enough to be an inconvenience, cuz if this place was any closer then it would have to be a regular stop, turning my present one pack stomach into a really huge one pack."}
{"text":"I do really like the Main Street Burger Shoppe - it's a sweet spot in Stouffville that offers quality burgers that isn't your local Harvey's or McD's.  Their burgers, both veg, and meat, are delicious.  

The portion sizes are humungous so definitely just order one order of fries to share with someone if you're going to order burgers AND fries.  Price point wise, they are definitely pricy.  My bill came close to $20 for a burger and fries meal.  

Would definitely return...just share those fries :P"}
{"text":"Yelp CM Kris U. of the Greater Toronto Area loves his fresh, quality homemade hamburgers. 

So, what a clever idea for Kris U. to start the year 2014 w/ a monthly CMYE Burger Brigade for Yelpers to try amazing burgers at different burger joints throughout the GTA. Hubby & I were fortunate to attend the 6th meeting of the Burger Brigade, held on 6/11/14, w/ GTA Yelpers for a sensory burger overload at Main St. Burger Shoppe in Stouffville (the \"f\" is silent) in Ontario, Canada. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=tVgsO0-8uT3ZFbsDgDgfOw  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=aoaKjaa_0mLpYGTBHMi6QQ  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=fIcaad4iKveqVx4JPL-SXQ 

The Main St. Burger Shoppe offers a choice of up to 4 fresh homemade hamburger patties (each is 4 oz.) grilled to order in a toasted sesame-seed loaded hamburger bun. They also have their signature burgers: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=otq-yx36lbYQLZcPyateuA 
 
- The Canadian - 1 patty, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices peameal bacon (boneless pork loin rolled in cornmeal & originating in Toronto), cheddar cheese, 100% Canadian maple syrup. 
 
- The Smokestack - 2 smoked patties, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices smoked cheese.

- The Hangover - 2 patties, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices cheddar cheese, fried egg, sautéed onions.

- The D.O.A. (Dead on Arrival) Burger - 3 patties, 3 slices cheese, 3 bacon strips, pulled pork.

All orders come w/ free non-meat toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish, olive relish, red onion, sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, hot peppers, jalapeno peppers) & free sauces (mustard, ketchup, mayo, honey mustard, Dijon mustard, BBQ sauce, hot sauce). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=SIP418_SB0xeoSKatBLcoA 

Hubby & I had:

- The Canadian. Added lettuce, tomato, jalapeno peppers. So delicious & juicy, including the stellar toasted bun that was loaded w/ sesame seeds. A thick & filling burger, the freshness of the beef couldn't be beat & loved it w/ the bacon & the sweetness of the maple syrup. 

- Regular Burger - 2 patties w/ free toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish, olive relish, sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms) & sauces (honey mustard, ketchup, mayo).  This was of the finest quality of freshness, juiciness, & full of flavor!  Couldn't believe how thick the burger sandwich was. As I had requested most of the toppings/sauces, it was quite messy to eat, but not complaining, as it was too good to be true. Amazing!  (also wished I had the appetite to try the Smokestack.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=ITRVJ89TgCAEF-AC_a4P2g 

Yelpers paid for their own burgers & CM Kris U. paid for the drinks & sides for all of us (thank you, Kris, very much appreciate!).  We shared: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=jiAvg8r_g4EbY5XfbyxARQ 

- French Fries - freshly made & crispy; locally sourced from nearby Simpson Produce farm. Not bad at all.

- Poutine - French fries topped w/ cheese curds & gravy, originating in Quebec. A Canadian specialty that is filling & a meal by itself.

- Potato Chips - fresh, thinly cut, lightly salted, & served warm right out of the fryer.  So tasty, crunchy, & out of this world! We all fell in love with this!

- Bottled Dad's root beer & a green lime soda. Both were refreshing! They also had other bottled flavors, as well as canned soda.

Opened in Aug 2013, the Main St. Burger Shoppe is family run by 2 brothers, John & Dewey, who love their burgers & previously owned a pizza business for 13 years. Located behind a pub & next to a car wash in the small town of Whitchurch-Stouffville of 38,000 residents - 31 miles north of downtown Toronto & surrounded by scenic rolling green hills of the Oak Ridges Moraine.  I love these Main Streets of these small towns where you find quaint shops that you can't resist going into! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/main-street-burger-shoppe-whitchurch-stouffville?select=WKbMDG9TFSz55fDCB15QfA  

This small burger joint is attractive & clean, w/ a few tables (check out that cool buffed silver top one) & window counter tables that can seat 18 total.

Many thanks to Kris U. & fellow GTA Yelpers for their warm hospitality & introducing hubby & me to Main St. Burger Shoppe in Stouffville!  Will definitely return if we're in town! Something we can't get back at home.

Note: Kudos to Kris U. for being a great CM for GTA in rounding up Yelpers to drive long distances to attend Yelp events! This area comprises the outlying suburbs of Toronto proper, & encompasses 2,751 sq miles w/ a population of about 5.5 mil; whereas, Oahu encompasses 297 sq miles w/ a population of 953,000.  Demographics are surely different."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever...My family and I try to go once a month.  Love their poutine and the awesome service,  always smiling and happy.  Love it there! Great place to go if U are in Stouffville."}
{"text":"Guys! This place is super cute ! Yummy burgers ! These are gourmet burgers. And did u say fried egg in my burger ! You had me at fried. Wow ! I'm so happy it's in Stouffville.  Shame it's Tucked in a corner just because it could easily be missed but it's a must try. Great setting and good burgers and poutine. We had the hangover burger and poutine with brisket. Nom nom ! I gave it only four stars for two reasons.. #1 the menu was missing kid meal options.... Like perhaps maybe sliders? Or small plate of nuggets... Something for kids. #2 speed .. It took a wee bit more time that we would like ...I mean I would feel bad if they were busy. I get it they are new and there are tweaks but I will definitely go back ! Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Main Street Burger in Stouffville review. 

The Stackhouse Burger 2 smoked patties and smoked cheddar cheese. 

I rate this burger 4 out 5 Cows. Fries rock and toppings were fresh and tasty. Washed down with a Pop Shoppe Cream Soda. $20 bucks."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend for lunch, he said it was the must go to spot in Stouffville for burgers, best burgers and fries in town. Who can you trust if not your friends, right?

Tucked behind a local pub on Main St, I don't even think I would have found this place on my own, well not without the help of Yelp and my friend. 

We had impeccable timing as the line grew quickly behind us, and seating here is limited, although it's nice that they have patio seating handy now that summer has finally appeared. 

Finally the moment had arrived I sat down and unwrapped the infamous burger. My first thought, how am I gonna get this burger in my mouth?? I didn't know my mouth could open so big, but I managed to get it in there. It was true, this was a great burger. The meat was juicy, tasty and fresh. I think they may grind the beef onsite. The fries tasted great as well, not overly salted and may have been cut on site even. 

When in the area I do agree that this place is the go to spot for burgers, wish it was a little closer to home though."}
{"text":"TIME TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY!!

This burger shop is definitely a hidden gem. When I say hidden, I mean it's really behind a car wash station.

Walked in there and got greeted right away at 2:50 pm , right smack in the middle of the afternoon after a great ski/snowboard day. There's about 12-15 seats there, so good if you are not eating with a large group of people.

I ordered the \"smokestack\" burger $10.95  and the small burger $4.98. 

You get to put your own toppings in there. I got lettuce tomato, pickles, hot peppers, and BBQ sauce to go with the smokestack burger, which comes with 2 patties, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices of cheese and caramelized onions. This burger is fully smoked and with tons of flavor. Every bite is just flavor town!!! 

Their patties are cooked medium rare and are super juicy.

We also ordered the poutine, in which they make their own fries and chips to order. Delicious dark gravy is poured over the cheese curds and fresh fries. 

There's definitely a lot to look forward to when you come into this burger joint. The owners are Viet and are super friendly. They will take their time to explain their foods to you if you ask kindly.

Must try something else there!!! There a burger called DOA burger and has 3 patties and a ton of meat in it. Looking forward to that!"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from friends, I finally ended up here at Main Street burger shop and wowww, I'm sad I'm not in stouffville more often to take advantage of this amazing establishment! Made my own with smoked cheddar, sautéed onions,sautéed mushrooms and mayo -simple, not many frills but oh man the flavour was awesome! Freshly prepared in front of you, served hot with the perfect side of crispy French fries- I was in burger heaven. If you want a good burger fix, head here and they'll satisfy that craving and then some. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Am always on the lookout for a new burger to love and drove for an hour straight after work last night to get here and give this one a try. The place was closed a full half hour before the posted time - I knocked on the door and waved at the workers and all three shrugged and refused to open the door to provide service. Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience. 

Won't be coming back, and won't be encouraging anyone else to either."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  We also tried the works hot dog and it was delicious :). This is our new go-to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Came in today as I was craving a burger, and the burger was in fact top notch. 5 out of 5. But the pop I bought was expired, which I never realized until I drank it and wondered why it seemed flat. So check the expiry before you take a drink out of the fridge.

The fries were good, but the gravy tastes funny (odd).

All in all a good experience minus the drink."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is amazing. Ok they have hand made burgers as you like. The BEST poutine made with fresh hand cut fries, you can add pulled pork, pork belly, or beef brisket to your poutine or burger. OMG I had the poutine with beef brisket and it was heaven. Just heaven. I really should not be eating poutine but OMG if you are going to be naughty this is the poutine to eat!

My colleague had a burger and he said it was just perfect. They hand make the burger just to your likings. 

I would say... Make the trip up to Stouffville to try this place! If you are in a rush order ahead of time. Also note: they are not open on Monday. Maybe I will see you there..."}
{"text":"Just writing a review for Main Street Burger Shoppe gives me craving for a good burger!

All the beef used here is Certified Angus Beef with a small burger starting from $4.39. Which is quite a bargain as it is how much Harvey's would have charge for their Original Burger which is not even half as good!

And if you want to be a little more fancy, you should try their signature burger. I love The Canadian ($9.50) with peameal, bacon and the use of Maple Syrup gave the burger a more balanced finishing touch.  

Thanks for our CM Kris U for ordering all the sides for us to share. I love the potato chips! But the poutine tasted just as good!

I know I will be coming back and I know I will be ordering a small regular and just loaded it up with toppings and make a mess from eating that!"}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers! Very tasty poutine . Great flavours overall and very fresh. The sitting space is tight. Good for takeout . 

We tried the chicken burgers recently and were not at all disappointed!"}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to try this place out, and was not disappointed! I took two of my colleagues and we all felt the same...the food is simply phenomenal. 

You can find burgers pretty much anywhere, and dishing out more money doesn't always guarantee a better product. Main Street Burger has great value and exceptional quality. 

Between the three of us we tried 2 smokehouse and one hangover burger with one order of regular fries. There was a bit of a wait, but that's only because they make the items fresh to order. 

The toppings were great, the bun was perfect, and the meat was damn fresh. 

How about this; I end the review here so you can get in your car and try one for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is MUST try for all burger lovers!!!
My hubby and I are frequent customers here since we discovered it. They use local and super fresh ingredients (tomatoes are always nice and firm); beef patties are freshly made and super delish!
Hubby loves the Smokestack, while I enjoy a regular burger. They offer premium toppings for no additional charge; sauteed mushroom & onion and fresh jalapeños peppers are my fav"}
{"text":"Very juicy burgers. Poutines are really good. Friendly people. Lovely place for great burgers."}
{"text":"Burger Binge Week review:  Regular Burger w/ Cheese + Bacon

In the outskirts of the GTA lies a small burger shop on Main Street Stouffville aptly named Main Street Burger Shoppe.  My wife and I decided to make this the first stop of our date afternoon.

So we don't stuff ourselves too early, we decided to split one burger and since it was burger binge week it was pretty much a steal almost.

This is one of those remote places outside of town where they can get some unique products.  In which case there pop also aptly branded \"The Pop Shoppe\" and we decided to get root beer.  For those who came from the Philippines, I don't think this tastes like Sarsi... it's so much better.

The Regular Burger w/ Cheese + Bacon is also aptly named, now that I think about it their branding strategy is probably \"stating the obvious\".  Doesn't really matter, it's still good.  It comes with two  grilled patties which are easily squished but there's a lot of veggies on a toasted bun.

It took a lot of will power to prevent us from getting another piece, we had to remind ourselves that we are still having butter tarts at Maid's Cottage later.

One flaw I would say is their straws are too short for the Pop Shoppe drinks.  Otherwise at the regular price at $8.63 it is still worth it even with the drive to Stouffville with dessert at Newmarket."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because I haven't tasted a burger more delicious around this area.

I ordered The Smokestack with the poutine. I really liked the generous portion of bacon. The patties were really fresh and juicy. I would say Burger Priest is better but by only a small margin. The buns were nothing to write home about but I liked how there are a variety of toppings you could choose which made the burger a bit more unique. A Yelp reviewer said in order to enjoy this burger, you had to not mind the \"smokey\" flavour which was supposed to be apparent. I did not taste such \"smokey\" flavour. The fries were way above my expectations; however, I didn't like the cheese curds (too thick) and the gravy was just ok. I am not the biggest fan of poutine though so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

I found the prices just a tad too expensive but I am not taking off any points for it since it was my choice to order what I did. You have the option to pay for the burger based on patty size and the prices are pretty reasonable if you want to go that route.

Service was fast and friendly. The wait for the burgers to be done was on par with other burger places. There weren't many tables for you to dine in but the place was nicely spaced out and you didn't feel like you were cramped anywhere. The single washroom is gigantic for the size of the restaurant. I was actually surprised when I walked in it!"}
