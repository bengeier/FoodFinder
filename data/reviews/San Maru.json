{"text":"Best Korean food in Champaign hands down. Great people making great food. Try the pork bulgogi if you like a bit of spice it's so delicious and the lunch special is only $7 bucks very reasonable for all the yummy meat you get atop glass noodles and rice!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the diversity of international students in Chambana area, there are so many choices in ethnic cuisine.  Now we have one more Korean restaurant in south-west side of Champaign and I believe that I had not seen any Korean restaurants nearby.  So it was a good news for me who lives close by and I do not have any reason not to try San Maru right after its opening.

First of all, you gotta try their chicken wings.  I have always thought that Crisp near Evanston, IL is the best chicken wing place in the nation.  Now, I don't need to drive up there any more. It's that good here. Try Teriyaki first and the spicy one next if you like it. And Sul-Lung-Tang (beef soup with rice) was the best in this town, IMO.  I heard from the chef that they boiled it more than 3 days and no MSG was added.  It seemed like they were proud of it and I think they could.  I also tried Yuk-Gae-Jang (spicy beef soup with vegetables) and it was also very good.  The price of Yuk-Gae-Jang was little high, but it was worth it.  

Specially, I would give extra stars for their side dishes (Ban-Chan).  Kimchi was top quality and every single side dish was flavorful.  Well, I am so glad to find a good Korean restaurant closest from my home and they have plenty of free parking space in the back.  You can't expect a fast service here, but they did their best.

Great addition to Chambana area."}
{"text":"Came here because of the stellar reviews and left disappointed. The soups are mediocre at best compared to the other Korean places in the area and ingredients are scant. Menu price is pretty high for what you are getting. On the plus side, staff is friendly and the place looks clean."}
{"text":"I had never had Korean food before but tried to make kimchi once and it was way too salty.  Food here was fantastic and fresh! Very polite and friendly staff to 2 ladies that had no idea what they were ordering.  Looking for an adventure? Try it!!"}
{"text":"Great addition in SW Champaign. Service could be slow, but most dishes I tried in my 4 visits were  very good, particularly the pancake with octopus and green onions and the 2 large sharable dishes of pork belly and beef tendon.  Also loved their fried pot stickers but sometimes they don't have them.  Thought their bibimbob could use more meat and the side dishes are not as plentiful as most Korean places I visited outside of C-U area."}
{"text":"Clean food, no msg taste. Bossam was a good dish to share. Sullungtang was done perfectly. Tasted like home cooked meal and that's as good as it gets for Korean food."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious and extremely friendly. Some of the best Korean food in Champaign!"}
{"text":"Great family style korean food! I thought the price was decent for the amount of food served. I loved the spicy fried chicken and dumplings."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner, and it was absolutely amazing. I am not that well accustomed to Korean food, but their food was insanely delicious. The boss is very nice and amiable, and the restaurant is very clean and pleasing. I had the bibimbap and had no real problems with it. However, what really made this visit was the dessert. I ordered the Red Bean Bing Su, and it was out of the park! The \"ice\" itself is in little strings, which I thought was very unique. I think the picture should explain it all! Pricing is a little on the high side, but it's worth it. I definitely recommend this restaurant -- it may be one of the best Asian restaurants in CU."}
{"text":"All around a great establishment although one of the workers was a fat asshole. The chicken wings however are very yummy"}
{"text":"Their seolung-tang is simply the best in this town."}
{"text":"Top notch service, gorgeous decor and delicious food!

My husband and I came here on MLK Day for lunch and had the bulgogi lunch special. I had beef and he had chicken. The meat was so tender and flavorful. 

We also ordered fried meat dumplings. The meat was so good. Wow.

We want to come back and try some of the tang offerings!"}
{"text":"Great bibimbap. I stopped in while driving across the Midwest, worth it if you're similarly driving through Champaign. The women who served us were incredibly nice. The place itself is like the food: clean and simple. Delicious kimchi as well, some nicely spicy pickled cabbage, and daikon radish (in a couple of variations). My wife ordered a couple of items that were not available, which was no big deal but I did want to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Ermahgerd... San Maru is sooo good. We got the Bossam with some rice. While the pork belly was well done, the meat was juicy. The sauces and lettuce accompanying the bossam was good. Their fried chicken was great too!

Dumplings seem to be unattainable though :( they're always out."}
{"text":"A really nice small friendly place. The staff were nice and food was yummy. Portion sizes were not too much not too little."}
{"text":"Their fried dumplings are simply amazing! This place is my official second kitchen; now that I live so close by .."}
{"text":"First time here. The place looks pretty new. Had the dolsot bibimbop and bulgolgi and they tasted great!  Service was top notch as well. Will definitely come back and try their bingsu! So far my favorite Korean place in town :)"}
{"text":"TL;DR (out of 5):
Located in a quaint strip mall shop in a rather secluded area of SW Champaign, San Maru offers classic, simple Korean dishes.  A great introduction to authentic Korean cuisine, the food here really feels like a warm embrace into someone's home.  Their bossam, seafood pancakes, and dduokgaegi are things you won't find at other common spots in CU and are made wonderfully.  Although you'll probably spend more here compared to other Korean places in town, the extra few bucks will definitely be worth it.

I was first introduced to San Maru by a friend who works in the area when they first opened and, to be honest, was kind of reluctant to visit due to its location in a relatively sparse area of Champaign.  I walked into the relatively clean, modern, and simplistically decorated shop and was still (although baseless) reluctant about the quality of the place.

My friend ordered the Bibimbop and I ordered the Seolleong-Tang.  Naturally, the meal came with an assortment of banchan (Korean side dishes), which was also very straightforward and prepared well.  The bibimbop had great flavors and was pretty basic, although executed perfectly.  I'd never tried seolleong tang (a beef bone soup with brisket and scallions), but wanted to try something new.  It was... pleasant? It had almost like a milky-ness to the flavor that I wasn't expecting, and I wouldn't say it's overly flavorful, but it had its subtle nuances that kind of grew on me as I worked my way through it.  The brisket was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  Not something I would recommend to people unless they're looking for something really different/new.

Over my next few visits, I got to try their bossam, seafood pancakes, and an assortment of other things (I think they've added to their menu over time, or else I would've ordered those during my first visit), and everything has always just been simple, classic, and delicious - nothing super fancy, but made with quality ingredients and as traditional methods as realistically possible.

If you like Korean food and frequent places like A-Ri-Rang or Woori-Jib (or Spoon house for something other than tacos or burritos) on campus, take a drive out to San Maru for something more authentic - something made with a little more flavor and a whole lotta' love.

Bibimbop: $10
Seolleong-Tang: $9
Bossam: $24
Seafood Pancakes: $12"}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. Waiter pretended to listen but was not. Took a long time for the order to arrive."}
{"text":"I logged in to Yelp to write a review!

The ingredients are fresh, and the taste is really fresh and good(not too salty or oily. Pleasantly seasoned)

Finally I don't need to go to Chicago to have good Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for Korean food. Service was excellent and the food was just like mom's...we swing by on our way to Lithuania Springs to camp--close so it's perfect and beats burgers and highway food joints. Definitely would recommend the bulgogi and the cold buckwheat noodles."}
{"text":"This place is golden. I have been waiting for a GOOD Korean place in town (all other places are mediocre or sub par), and they delivered. Tastes almost as good as my mother's cooking. The dumplings are made from scratch, down to the dumpling skin, which is quite impressive. Their fried dumplings and chicken is phenomenal, as well as the sulungtang and bossam. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the dumplings and the nokdu bin da dduk ( its Korean savory pancake).

Only problem with this place is that the lady does not offer it every day. You have to catch her on a good day.  Otherwise I would have give 4 stars."}
{"text":"A new Korean place in town that, so far, is worth the rave reviews. We've been here twice already in the short time it has been open, and I think it now is my favorite Korean restaurant. By far my favorite non-fast-food restaurant. It is small and still \"getting their feet wet,\" but everything we've had has been excellent. The menu is Korean home-style and is quite excellently prepared. The wait-staff is attentive, but not overly so. They seat you quickly, bring menus when you are seated and come by again quickly for drink orders. You are given some time peruse the menu but the staff is nearby if you have questions about what something might be or how something is prepared. If you think you are being given too much time or need some help, just look up at your waitress/waiter and she/he will be right there. Food is at least mostly cooked to order, so it isn't immediate like in a fast food place, but it won't be long until you are enjoying 

We've fallen for the YukGaeJang, a beef stew or soup full of vegetables. Great flavor and plenty to eat. And my wife and I also love the Kimchi and macherel stew for two. In fact, every item on the menu that we've tried provides plenty to eat, and my family can eat a lot. I've heard \"yelping\" (sorry) by customers when they see  eighteen or twenty dollar prices on a \"Chinese\" menu, but they need to remember, this is real food, not fast food. And San Maru has plenty of seven dollar menu items as well.  And so far, whatever the price on what we've ordered, it has been well worth it. 

I expect San Maru will need to (1) find enough staff to open on Sundays, (2) expand or move as people discover the place. This, in my mind, is to Korean food what Golden Harbor is to the local Chinese restaurant market: authentic, delicious, with many items unparalleled among local options. I highly recommend it and wish it great success. I hope some new items or specials are added regularly as we intend to work our way through the entire printed menu. I hope San Maru lasts and remains wonderful

As I said, it is not fast food. But it may become that for people who use the soon to be available \"order ahead online\" option. We prefer to linger and talk over our meals, so we probably won't do the order ahead option; the fifteen or twenty minutes or food prep time is fine with us as we don't need to be served immediately. But that soon will be an option for those in a hurry. 

Just open a couple of weeks, but so far it is a wonderful addition to the Champaign Urbana dining scene, a true stand-out in a market with lots of Asian options already. And, with so many decent take-out only/mostly places (many of which are quite decent), we truly appreciate a place with table service and a nice ambiance when we want to eat out."}
{"text":"Wow! There are several good Korean restaurants in Champaign/Urbana, but San Maru is by far the best in my opinion. I have been there 3 times so far, and I left each time wanting to come back and try everything on the menu. I had fried and steamed dumplings, all made from scratch including the skin. These apparently are very popular and often sell out. The fried chicken wings  had sweet, spicy, and tangy taste I had never tasted before, and it is GOOD! Their naengmyun (cold noodles) are served either in a cold broth or in sweet and spicy sauce. I tried the broth, and it was so good. They do not use MSG. They do not serve any alcohol, and they are closed on Sundays. The interior is clean, and the staff is super friendly. Last but not least, you got to try their Bingsoo. This is a shaved frozen milk topped with all sorts of toppings such as mocha, green tea, vegetables, sweet red bean paste, etc."}
{"text":"Dining area is clean and comfortable, staff is very friendly and attentive, food tastes and looks amazing! If you like Asian cuisine, you'll adore this place! I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"San Maru is quite a bit off campus, but as for good food, it knocks it out of the park. Like holy cow! I was completely blown away by our meal. We had a little bit of everything since we had heard good things about the place. The pancakes are large and you probably could share 1 between 4 people as an appetizer. The wings are also phenomenal. They come out perfectly crispy and tender. 

Short ribs are great if a bit expensive. Honestly, I could go on about all of the good things, but everything was fantastic. Okay, the drink selection was limited, but all you really need is some cold water to deal with the spice and cleanse your pallet. 

The feel of the place is hip and has that modern colorful look when honestly, I think the restaurant would look better as an expensive date night restaurant. Seriously, the staff is so friendly and the food so good, I was shocked that there was nobody else there. Take a drive out west in champaign and bring some friends. If they haven't had good korean food, this is the place to start before becoming jaded by poorly done bibimbap. 

The establishment is not what you expect and comes off as fast casual, but the food is top notch with time from order to eating ranging 10-15 minutes. 4/5 stars because its far away and the setting clashes with the food, but 6/5 for being a bastion of good food in a sea of mediocrity."}
{"text":"Great homemade Korean fare right off of I57 in Champaign. Owner came right over to our table to help us make our selections. She told us that her sister owns a restaurant in DC and has won awards for her original teriyaki sauce. We had it on the chicken wings and they were crispy and delicious. Also enjoyed the steamed pork dumplings and Bee Bim Bop. Great casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I used to go San Maru every couple of weeks but I stopped. The quality of food is not as good as before. I ordered a pot of hot beef stew last time. With over $10 per pot, you should expect to get a decent amount of beef. No, I got only tiny, shredded pieces of beef on the bottom of my pot. My friend who ordered seafood one is the same: only tiny pieces of sea food but with lots of kimchi. With other korean restaurants around the town, I will not go back to San Maru again. It is really not worth of the money."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised when I saw that this restaurant rated full 5 stars on Yelp with 7 reviews, and so I was tempted to visit this place, be as picky as I can, and be the first one to give 4 stars. But as you can see, I surrendered.

- Taste
We had seolleong tang, dogani tang, bossam, and nakgi bokkeum (and to-goed some fried dumplings).

First two soups were authentic and nice. I am pretty sure that they serve best tangs in this town.

For bossam, I think I can be a little more critical. I found them a little tough and dry. I believe that a better method to re-moisturize pork belly slices should be devised. Observing some signs of contraction and twist on the pork skin, I guessed that maybe the meat was not sliced just before being served, but was kept sliced for a while. Plus, they were not sliced evenly.

For nakgi bokkeum, I was really happy about its tenderness and seasoned-ness. It was a little too small for me but I really cannot expect more.

Fried dumplings (both Kimchi and Meat) were truely amazing. $20 dollar for 20? I think I could pay $30 for them.

Side dishes were all so good. I wish I could buy a pound of them each and bring them home.

- Service
They would not visit your table too often but it is fine (the place is not too big). Overall they were kind and friendly.

- Atmosphere
Clean, bright and open, more like Spoon house or Bab plus than Sushi rock or Sakanaya."}
{"text":"Slightly away from the U of I campus but the food and the atmosphere are great.  The restaurant is neat, organized and well-managed.  Also, the owner is very friendly and welcoming!  So, how much does that tell you?  It's worth visiting with your friends, family, and loved ones :)"}
{"text":"Great food in very clean, informal atmosphere.  The prices are reasonable, the service is prompt, and the staff are very friendly.  I plan to eat there again and highly recommend it to my friends.  Korean food just like \"omma\" (Korean for mom) made!"}
{"text":"Great Korean Food! We had the steamed dumplings and wings which were a great start. We followed it up with a beef stew and bibimbap. Everything was hot and fresh. Service was very friendly and efficient. We will come back on our trip from Chicago to St Louis."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time tonight and it is definitely going into our \"favorites\" list!  The dumplings were incredible as was the beef bulgogi.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is very casual but  don't let that fool you.  The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"San Maru is located in the Village Green Place shopping center.  Near my family's home yet they had never stopped in. So on the occasion of my father's birthday, I suggested that we go. 

I actually wasn't that hungry so I ended up getting wings and dumplings.  My bro got Bibimbop ($10.99): Colorful vegetables, bulgogi, and egg arranged over rice and served with red pepper sauce to mix. Served with Kimchi, Kkakdugi, Bean Sprouts, and Potatoes/Fish cake. My mom got Jabchae ($12.99): Stir-Fried Korean sweet potato noodles with beef, egg, and vegetables. My dad got Yukgaejang ($12.99): Spicy beef soup with scallions and other vegetables.

I didn't think that my wings were that great, but the dumplings were very nice. Everyone really liked their food. It was not busy so it was very chill and service was quick."}
{"text":"What's better than fresh, housemade pickled radish and kimchi? Unlimited bowls of it! In traditional style, waiters bring you dishes of 2 varieties of pickled daikon along with a dish of kimchi to eat before and during your meal. The waiters are very helpful/informative when it comes to menu items and spice levels. It has a very cozy feeling to it, very upbeat and modern. And the prices are affordable as well."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Just like how my Korean mom made!. The staffs were friendly. The food tasted like it was cooked with only natural ingredients. Dumplings and seolung tang ( milky beef broth soup) were so yummy. I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Even though San Maru is about 15 minutes off campus, they have great quality food. Every time I visited this restaurant, I always left satsified and wanting to come back another time. IMO, best Korean food in the Champaign-Urbana area. All of their soups are very filling and delicious, and their bingsoo is very unique since it is shaved snow bingsoo. Melts in your mouth! The one sad point with San Maru is that their dumplings are always sold out, but their chicken wings don't disappoint! 

Anything you try here, you won't leave upset!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the last time here.  The quality was sub-par on everything, and some things were just not good.  For example, the steamed egg custard was forgotten, then arrived mysteriously burnt on the bottom, the acrid smoke of the burnt eggs ruining the entire dish.  The dolsot bibimbop was disappointing as well, with scant and poorly executed toppings.  The bulgogi was decent enough but just not memorable in any way.  The kalbi soup was good but was only a trifle in substance.  Ddukbokki (stir fried rice noodles with gochujang) was too saucy for my taste.

On a positive note, the pancake was still very good and their kimchee/ban chan items were excellent.  The must try dessert - bingsoo (shave ice made with milk) is always delicious but - horrors! - they ran out of red bean!  Our substitute was made with assorted fruit and was still tasty."}
{"text":"A small family-operated Korean restaurant. Food is authentic. The reason I gave three stars is the bibimbap was not as good as the one I had at other Korean restaurants. The kimchichigae was very good though."}
{"text":"My second time having San Maru and it is so good. The service is good too. Reasonably priced and large portions. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly people! I got a carry out order and when I walked inside I came to see an incredibly clean and modernized environment! The lunch special was fantastic! I got a sliced beef lunch plate and I was very impressed! Flavor was more than impressive, not too much not too little. And the small salad it comes with had an amazing slight spice to it. Overall A++ I will be coming back shortly! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I think this place has very good Korean food but unfortunately not 5-star worthy. Both times, my table ordered the seafood pancake and pork belly to share. The seafood pancake is probably the best pancake I've ever had from any Korean restaurant in the area and maybe from any Korean restaurant I've ever been to. It is crispy and loaded with seafood, really well done and quite delicious. The pork belly lettuce wrap dish is also pretty good, although the pork belly itself is a little plain and really needs a lot of sauce. The first time I went, there was a lot of fat and not a whole lot of meat and the second time there was a lot more meat. A little inconsistent but I suppose this isn't something they can control. The first time I went, I had the beef bulgogi. It was delicious but very much the typical bulgogi. The second time I had bibimbap, it was very good, but again nothing really special and the egg was slightly overdone. Overall, after 2 visits, I think they have some outstanding items like the pancake, and everything else is just well done Korean food."}
{"text":"Fair price for the taste and size of each dish! Tangs are really good too. Recommend steamed dumplings! Juicy and tender. 
The wings are delicious but the coating is kind of hard. If the tables are larger it will be fantastic."}
{"text":"San Maru is a Korean restaurant located at The Crossing in southwest Champaign. After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, I decided to try it. It's a very clean and tidy restaurant, but from the start I sensed that this restaurant can't make it even though the food is quite good. My companion and I went there at about 1 PM on a Saturday afternoon. We decided to sit at a table outside since it was a nice day. I asked the person at the counter if service was available outside, and she said yes, and asked if we wanted menus. That was the first odd sign. I took the menus, and she said that we would have to order at the counter and pay up front. That was the second odd sign. We took the menus outside and looked them over. We both decided to have the dumplings for a start, and then two lunch bowls, one fried chicken pieces and one shrimp. I went inside and placed my order. We wanted dumplings, but they told me they were out of them. I ordered the chicken wings instead. Then I was asked to pay. I paid with a credit card, and couldn't decide how much of a tip to leave. I asked if a server would bring the food to our table, and she said yes, so I put a tip on the card, but not as much as I usually would. I went back outside and sat back down at the small table which had a slight wobble to it.  We sipped the glasses of water (no ice) that they had brought, and waited for our food. The lunch bowls were brought out promptly. They consisted of a large amount of rice topped with a few vegetables, and several pieces of chicken and shrimp, and drizzled with teriyaki sauce and mayo. The dish was under seasoned, very bland and short on vegetables. We had eaten half of the bowls before the wings were served. They were seasoned better, with a nice crackly skin, a bit of spiciness and some heat. We ate those, and left half of our bowls unfinished. Since we only tasted two dishes, I can't speak to the overall quality and taste of the other menu items. I will say that this restaurant is in the wrong part of town to be run like a campus semi-fast food place. If non-college students go to a $$ restaurant, they expect to be waited upon, served, and then pay the bill. I would love to see this restaurant survive, but they will need to re-do their marketing strategy to do so. If they do this, I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love San Maru.  It's a nice quiet place that's a 25 minute drive from campus, but the food is worth it. I've had the yuk gae jang, kimchi jjigae, pajeon, fried mandu, bulgogi lunch special, and the fruit and green tea patbingsu.  The yuk gae jang is nice and hearty with a good amount of spice whereas the kimchi jjigae was spicy but overall all right.  The pajeon is SO good here. It has lots of seafood and tastes great with the soy sauce mixes.  The meat mandu has a light flavor and texture, so it isn't too heavy or overpowering.  The bulgogi special comes with glass noodles, rice, bulgogi, and a salad with dressing. It's pretty tasty and for about $7-$8, it's definitely a great deal.  The patbingsu is honestly why the reason I come though.  The fruit one is nice and sweet but also light.  It comes with frozen blueberries, strawberries, and mango with a fruit sauce and sweet cereal underneath.  The green tea one is nice and sweet without the tang of the fruit bingsu.  It's definitely a sweeter finish than the fruit, but not overwhelmingly so.  The shaved ice itself has a milky flavor. It always helps to cool down the spice from any of the tang or jjigae.  It costs about $10 for each patbingsu. I recommend this place for lunch since it's never too busy from 11 to 2."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town. Such nice management and waiter. Food came very speedily and was nothing short of pure dankness. It was very authentic and was served in nice portions. Even the bathrooms were spotless . Walking out the door had me in tears. Really looking forward to my next experience."}
{"text":"San Maru is probably one of the best Korean places in Champaign. Everything is so hearty. I recommend the selongtang or galbitang. For apps, the dumplings are a must ,if they're available."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat dinner. Love their chicken wings! Very tasty...try the mild sauce. The dumplings were also excellent. Plan to go back for a full meal soon. Can't miss spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bibimbap & short ribs, both were very delicious! Especially the short ribs, YUM. So tender, lots of flavor. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the portion of bulgogi you get is very small so every time I order I ask for extra meat ($3) which isn't that big of a deal but that's the average portion I've gotten from other Korean restaurants with no extra charge. Overall love this place to get my Korean fix! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find a great Korean place that's OFF campus!
As soon as you walk in here you'll notice the place is super clean and decorated super cute. The staff was also super friendly and attentive too. But the food! The dumplings were on point, drinks were good, and the bibimbap was delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience, especially after seeing all of the other rave reviews. My friend and I both ordered one appetizer and two entrees: I got the kimchi pork jjigae and she got bulgogi. I had two pieces of meat in my dish, which reminded me of my bad experience at Bab Plus. The chicken wings are essentially sweet meat. It felt like they already had the wings cooked and added another layer of batter and refried them. 

The waitress forgot to give us side dishes, and then tried to gip us with only one entree's worth, claiming she had put two portions into one. There was drama with one of the customers having asked for extra sauce on the side, and the manager(?) having a small debate with him, only to visit him later to apologize. Don't get me wrong, the service was nice-- but at times intrusive. This place may be great for some, but not for me."}
