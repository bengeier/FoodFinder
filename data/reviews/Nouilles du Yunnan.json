{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Their interior design is quite interesting. I came here to try when they opened not too long ago. To explain their menu, you must choose your broth base and then it comes with 10 little plates with ingredients. It's not too expensive considering the amount of noodle restaurants in downtown Montreal but the small ingredients can be filled up a little more. If you do not eat pork, you cannot switch your meat for another type but you could order an extra plate of side dish.   I tried the tomato soup which was quite yummy. I wouldn't recommend this place for children because they serve the soup in a hot pot of 150 degrees. One thing that is really different from other restaurants is that they offer unlimited noodle servings.   I would recommend people to try their tomato broth because it taste like comfort food. It isn't too salty. This restaurant offers a cool and different experience to eat noodles."}
{"text":"Good quality Chinese traditional noodle with cheap price. Love the noodles here. Would come back."}
{"text":"The noodles is good with different soup. I recommend you to try Kimchi soup. It is  little bit spicy. The price is acceptable."}
{"text":"Authentic Yunnan rice noodles in Montreal! You get to choose the broth and what goes in to accompany your rice noodles."}
{"text":"This is a noodle shop in Montreal and there seem to be many noodle shops in the area. In this particular establishment, you first choose the soup base and then they bring you all of the condiments, such as pickled vegetables, beef, cabbage, etc. You can also add extra ingredients at a cost such as pork chops, shrimp, etc.  All extra noodles are free so can order as much as you want.  The soup base and noodles were delicious. The soup is served very hotly so be careful when it is first served to you. We had the traditional base of chicken broth.  Service was good, and the servers were friendly. They were happy to explain the process from the menu. Overall, the food was tasty, and we would come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat near Concordia. You can add as much noodle as you want  So if you are very hungry, definitively take a look  Interior design is also great"}
{"text":"The taste is okay but the food is not fresh. Therefore, my friend and I both get food poisoning afterwards...don't recommend"}
{"text":"This is a new Chinese restaurant. The location used to be an Asian BBQ restaurant and got a full renovation. The decoration has a taste of Yunnan which is a province of China famous for the rice noodle.  The main courses are rice noodles only. You get choose the soup base and extra toppings. There are 6 flavours. I had a sour and spicy one (as in chinese as golden soup) and my husband had a chicken broth one. I like these two flavors very much. So genuine in the taste and in presentation. I always add extra Sichuan Pepper oil (????in the noodle. Recommend you try it too.  The pot is very hot to maintain he temperature and to cook the raw meat. Never touch it. I got burn several times. I do recommend the restaurant serve with a small bowl to avoid accidentally contact with the pot.  I would like to come back to try other flavours."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this restaurant online... cannot remember what the heck i was searching for but there it was. It sounded good enough for lunch around Concordia!!  I want to give this 3 & 1/2 stars but there is no half option so Im gonna keep it at 3 as there are other reviews of mine that placed places at 4 stars for real and I don't want to get anyone confused for the quality of my four-stars :P  This place is cute, has the story of Yunnan Bridge depicted on the wall (I read it online before going) The staff is polite although half of the time they didn't understand us neither in English or French, but we all got what we wanted, kinda.   The concept is simple enough: u get a hot bowl of broth at 130°C, u drop in all the \"toppings\" and the noodles are unlimited. You can pay for extra toppings if you want. There are also appetizers & we took the spicy duck gizzards which was pretty yummy.  I would come back again for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Offensive waitress demanding tips explicitly, loudly and refusing to take a slightly cut yet 100% complete bill. More importantly, the food does not taste fresh."}
{"text":"On Bishop street?!?!  Are you crazy?  It's one if those restaurants that open for the Grand Prix and charge an arm and a leg just because they have cute waitresses!  Please don't bother me again with such crazy \" suggestions \"!  Thanks."}
