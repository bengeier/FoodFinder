{"text":"Pretty affordable, real Mexican food. Try the carne asada machetes! They're sooo good, so are the tacos."}
{"text":"We are in hopes this is a place that stays awhile.in our neighborhood.  They just opened so i wont gibe them a bad rating for the mix up on our order. I feel they will work out the little.tweeks. The meat is very flavorful .. I havent tried the Machete yet but tried everythi g else. I love the fact that it is actual street tacos.   The salsa is ok , i actually enjoy the one for the menudo better. I will definitely be frequenting here as well as our coworkers

{"text":"We came to this Broadacres location in search of some legendary carne asada - and we found it. While I'm all about the al pastor, we all decided to test the baseline plate with carne asada. 

Now, it wasn't just quality meat. What really made this long machete-shaped quesadilla was the tortilla itself. I don't know what they do differently from anyone else in the area, whether they sprinkle love, unicorn dust, hopes and dreams, or all of the above, but the tortilla + contents are absolutely, ridiculously delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, great services, definitely recommend, you need to try different kind of food, this Mexican food is amazing, I order one machete of chicharr√≥n with extra cheese"}
{"text":"So  the 10 of me and the rest of my band decided it was time to eat at machetes after being highly recommended by a few amigos but we showed up 8:50 pm Wednesday night even though yelp said it closed at 10 pm and was still open... But the ladies inside motioned inside they were closed...so...we goin someplace else...adios machetes"}
{"text":"Sometimes I hate giving away my favorite food spots but this is one I hope everyone gets to try if your in Las Vegas! They basically make home made tacos (including the masa on-site) that are so huge and delicious that they call them \"Machates\".  You fill them up with any type of meat, seafood, and/or veggies you want and they cook it all on some big stone.  It's located at The Broadacers Swap Meet inside the tent area where there is a food renaissance going on by the way."}
{"text":"Went to the booth at broad acres.
Burrito was nice and juicy with good flavors.
Staff was friendly and patient with our non Mexican obliviousness.
The machette was filling and tasted good.
Thumbs up, will stop by the restaurant if in the area at mealtime"}
{"text":"We just moved down the street from Machetes and we will be going there a lot! The food is delicious and amazing! Yum! It's very fresh, authentic and full of flavor. It's also really nice to dine on their outdoor patio on a warm Vegas evening. The staff is great. The gals helped us with the menu and we got exactly what we wanted. Everyone was really friendly and nice. Highly recommended Machetes!"}
{"text":"My review is for the location inside Broadacres.  Although, I'm sure their permanent location is just as good.  My husband and I split a Machete - 1/2 pastor/1/2 pollo.  You can see the kitchen and watch it being prepared.  There is a woman that makes the tortillas and then they are  cooked on a flat griddle to melt the cheese and then the meat is added.  They asked if we wanted it with everything which was lettuce and crema.  It was served with green and red salsa.  Neither were too spicy for us (we usually can't handle anything hotter than mild). At this location they also served panboso (sp), they were sandwiches that also looked tasty.  The employees were helpful, the kitchen was super clean, and the food was delish!"}
