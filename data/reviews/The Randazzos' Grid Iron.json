{"text":"The food is excellent, but it is too much of a bar atmosphere for me. Booth seating was right next to the bar, which got quite loud at times. I would suggest a different seating arrangement for dine-in."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch after a long drive. The food and service were both excellent. The meatball wedge was the best I've ever tasted!

Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the lasagna and got mush instead. It was a pile of cheese in a sea of grease. The manager came out and gave a backhanded apology saying that people have different tastes. Waitress was fine and was sincerely apologetic. I disliked my visit and treatment there so much that I downloaded the yelp app just to complain about it. Won't be visiting there again."}

{"text":"Hidden gem in south Charlotte. True \"Cheers\" vibe. Great drink specials and some of the best Italian food in the city (trust me) Amy hosts a great party"}
{"text":"Bad, really bad food. Now they have a sign that says Italian food out front. Italian? Are they kidding? What did Italy do to them?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food, and bar area is very nice.  Wait staff is always friends and prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner.  My children ordered chicken nuggets, they were burnt.  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich and asked that the sauce be on the side.  She had to send it back.  I ordered the Italian panini.  I had to send I back twice, as they left the plastic casing on the meat each time.  They removed the price of my sandwich, since I asked them not to replace it.  Service was slow."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Salmon was so dry it was difficult to cut much less eat.  Husband ordered a panini and it was on toasted white bread....definitely not a panini.
Not happening again.  Too many good restaurants in Charlotte to waste time and money here."}
{"text":"My 93 year old father and I had lunch here for the 4th or 5th time ... service is always slow but the burgers are good and it is never crowded.   Today the service reached such a low point that I think we will not be back.   We ordered a glass of wine which took about 20 minutes to arrive.   I inquired why (place was virtually empty) and was told she was waiting for the bartender.   The bartender was rarely at the bar, and in fact was waiting on tables and had more tables than this one waitress did.   I ordered Pinot Noir and she finally arrived with a glass of white wine and had no idea that this was wrong.    After another 10 minutes while waiting for the \"bartender\" to have a free moment, I was told they no longer have Pinot Noir and that is why she brought me Pinot Grigio.    As if that made any sense at all.   Eventually a glass of Cab was produced.   It took      almost 45 minutes for them to produce two burgers.   People came, ate and left while we were waiting for this food.   I really think she forgot to put it in until I asked what was taking so long.   The bizarre answer I got to that question was that the burgers take longer because they are made to order.   Also they didn't expect so many people.     (There were 5 tables of people and the \"bartender\" was waiting on all of the others but one.)     The burgers were well-done (ordered medium rare).   My knife was dirty ... waitress did kind of say \"yuck\" but never came back with a clean one.     All in all, it was a really bad experience.    It is too bad but these service issues are easily remedied with a little thoughtful management ... and yet it gets worse and worse.    There are many other options in this area, and will get our burger fix elsewhere.    It is too bad ... we want to like this place."}
{"text":"Reasonable drink prices and some of the best Italian food I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place so I stopped in for breakfast early on a Sat morning.  Price was cheap, 2 eggs, hash browns & toast for $3.95. Coffee was only $1.69. Eggs cooked as ordered , hash browns were very good. Wheat toast was nice and thick although a little too soft.  Thought food was a good value for the money.  Cons:  kind of weird because half the place looks like a big sports bar and the restaurant side seems rather small. It was not well lit, but was nice and clean. The swinging kitchen doors which are the old wooden variety like in a saloon, where very annoying. Service was very slow. Just plain understaffed.  They need to work on it, but this place definitely has possibilities."}
{"text":"The Grid Iron used to have much better food for the prices that you pay.  The service and live music was nice.  But the burger I ordered was not any better than a number of places to eat around Fort Mill.  In particular they use some type of mayonaise like sauce that is not very good on all of their burgers."}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed with their breakfast. I have tried it several different times and it just doesn't do it for me. My last trip I had a pancake breakfast with two eggs, hash browns and two pieces of bacon. My real issue is with the eggs they served me. They were burnt and cooked down to nothing. Honestly it looked like one scrambled egg to me. I think I've had enough at this point. I ate there on 12/19. Try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We were VERY hesitant to give this place a shot - especially after reading the reviews. The coupon got us in the door. We are glad we went. The food was delicious! Try the calzones and the eggplant parm. The crust was perfect and the sauce tasty! The service was fantastic! Give the local place a chance!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting too much based on what I saw on Yelp but a friend told me to give Grid Iron a try and OMG it was a great experience.  The waitress was super friendly and the food was really good.  My wife and I shared a Stromboli and boneless chicken wings and we had plenty to take home.  Our friends enjoyed their time too and finished their meals.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The outside appearance is something like a large log cabin. The restaurant features an outside eating area, traditional insides with booths and tables, bar area and something like a conference room. The waitress was kind and soft spoken but the service was lagging. Took a while to get greeted and our drinks (2 waters). One plus was the blackening of our grilled chicken. 
We ordered two salads and an appetizer of bruschetta. The bruschetta was awesome although the bread was a bit over toasted and tough. We wouldn't have ordered it if our waitress told us she was bringing a basket of garlic bread with our salads. The bread was to die for I'm not gonna lie, as well our salads made with fresh lettuce, and a side of homemade ranch. 
The restaurant did not scream Italian, actually it just felt like a traditional American restaurant with a menu that had some script font. Oh yes, and the two toilet seats in the women's bathroom needed replacing...whatever it's coated with is peeling off. 
Food was pretty good but I don't think we will be regulars because our bill was $30, which to me is a bit much for a couple of salads and some toasted bread topped with chopped tomatoes garlic and oil."}
{"text":"Fhat is a cozy place. Food not good but enviroment is excellent."}
{"text":"I went to the grid iron on tryon street in Steele creek area to grab some breakfast and walked in to a party a few seconds ahead of me waiting to be seated. The gal promptly seated them and never came back to the stand. After 5 minutes of waiting (with several wait staff passing by) I popped my head into the dining room reminding the gal I'm still waiting... She replied in a sassy tone that she \"was not ready for me\". Please note that there were plenty of tables unoccupied and there were several wait staff in the area with what appeared to have any immediate needs from their tables."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service and reasonable prices!  So glad there is a breakfast place in the area.  Try it out....you won't be disappointed.  Thanks Randazzo Family for bringing another great restaurant to Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for Sunday breakfast for a few weeks. The food is good but inconsistent and the servers should step up in quality control. Food comes out burnt sometimes and cold others and the orders aren't always correct. And kids eat free but they never do that automatically so make sure you check the check!  All that said it has potential, if they can get their act together"}
{"text":"Servers are awesome,  the food is a hole in a wall quality.  I can taste a recycle grease used on their food.. the owners are grouchy  rude and cheap. The female owner  is the worst along with her husband, they are both cheap and rude they serve old refrigerated food  and please don't ask for bread. The owners recycle that also. And the tea, make sure your silverware  are clean also, bring sanitary wipes with you. I give this place a 2 because I have been there 3 tines  meaning 3 strikes on food,  I almost barf  on the quality and taste  of the food. The son cooks and from what I heard he is gross, so I give this place a 1 star."}
{"text":"We had a group meeting there for Christmas Gathering for Dinner. The private room we were in was nice but cold. Even with the staff increasing the temperature it remained cool. The server assigned to the private party room was great. He was efficient, professional and managed the group very well. The big issue for us was the quality of the food. One member of the group got the prime rib. It was overcooked and turned gray. In general, most of the groups food was bland and was not a good value (quality for price paid). My wife and I both had New York Strip steaks, ordered medium. They were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature. As a result they came out overcooked. They were medium well to well. They gladly cooked us two new steaks. They, again, were not cooked to Medium...overcooked to medium well. We just took them and ate very little of them. They were not seasoned well. A good steak never requires steak sauce. A-1 helped add flavor. We left 2/3 of each steak in the table. I guess we could have asked for a doggy bag and literally took them home to our dog. If not for the poor quality of the overall food experience this would be a much different review. 

To recap: 
1) The private room was great but never warmed up.
2) The server was as good as you could ever ask for.
3) The food was lackluster."}
{"text":"We live close by so we visit almost weekly.  I must say that each time the quality and service diminishes. Last night we ordered steaks, the chef came out and said they didn't have any. I ordered Chicken Alfredo and when it arrived chicken was not in my dish. This use to be my favorite dish! Lastly, my father ordered the BBQ rib special and when they arrived they were short ribs and not baby backs. Needless to say, our meal was horrible. The service was horrible and when we received our check it was incorrect due to all the items we did not receive."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think this place even deserves one star. To begin, we arrived on a Saturday early evening. The place wasn't that busy but the tables were dirty and when we asked for them to be washed the waiter just brushed the crumbs off into the booth which we then wiped out of the way ourselves. We asked if the margarita mix was fresh or mixed and the waiter lied and told us fresh, but when they arrived at the table it was obvious it was premixed crap. We also asked for a Gran Marnier floater ( I will get back to this). When the waiter took our order he leaned on the table with his elbows and upper body and he smelled like old booze and cigarettes. GROSS! I ordered the manicotti which came with a pathetic side salad of brown bagged iceberg lettuce and a near frozen tomato slice, all of which smelled profusely of chlorine. I didn't eat it. When I unrolled my dinnerware to eat it was dirty and the manicotti was soggy, bland and cold in the middle. My friend ordered clams which the waiter also lied and said were fresh, but they were rubbery and tasted canned. They were drenched in butter and olive oil making them unpalatable. We each picked at our plates and decided to have another drink and just leave. We each ordered another margarita and our bill. I nearly had a heart attack when I noticed on the bill that we were charged $18.00 FOR EACH margarita. That's $80 for 4 drinks. When we asked about why in the world they were so much we were told that the Gran Marnier was an additional $9.00 per drink and that there was nothing he could do about it and that there wasn't a manager available to talk to us. This happened two weeks ago and I am still furious. I have had margaritas in Los Angeles and New York with a Gran Marnier floater and was NEVER charged $18.00 for one short glass margarita. I would not recommend this place to anyone at any time. Horrible, classless service, nasty food I wouldn't feed to an animal and a complete rip off on the alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is great, much less pretentious than Hickory Tavern. Prices are great, atmosphere is relaxed and staff are super friendly and knowledgable. I've been here many times in the last 5 years and I can assure you that within the last two years this place has become a great place to go. Back in 2012-2013 it struggled but now the management has turned things around. If you want a local place that's comfortable, with good food & great prices (great place to watch sports too!), go here. You'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Service doesn't suffer while we were here today as well as the other times we've been here. The prices can't compete. Kids eat free breakfast with an adult meal. Family of 4 are for less than $20"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here since we reside across the street;  however the reviews were not so great.  Screw it! Let's do this. We sat at the bar and immediately were greeted.  We ordered two decent drafts and chatted with the staff. Tyler was awesome.  Politics, beer, hot topics - he is your man. 

We ordered the artichoke and spinach dip with pita chips to devour in house. DELICIOUS! And the all meat pizza 14 inch, of course, and mozzarella sticks to go. All were very tasty. 

They have touch tunes but when they upgraded you are unable to use the app. Bummer, but probably saves me some coinage lol

Not sure why this place gets such a bad rap.  We will come here more to obtain additional Intel.  Great place to check out.  Wonderful staff and tasty treats."}
{"text":"Breakfast review only, and it's not good.

I went here with my family this morning for breakfast, which they serve until 12.  Kudos for that, especially since we got there at 11AM.  I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.  

Before I get to the ugly, here's the good:
They serve breakfast until noon.  Yay.
Service was friendly, attentive and prompt.
They have VERY inexpensive menu options--I didn't see any meal over $7.95, and the one I ordered was $3.95.  That's wonderful!  And, no, portions are not stingy.

The coffee was bleh.  Then again, I have yet to find a breakfast place that serves coffee that isn't as pale as my favorite cup of tea.  When the coffee did arrive (promptly, I will say), we were given creamer, but no sugar.  She quickly returned with a little box of sugar/sweetener packets, but it had only 2 sugar packets, with 2 people drinking coffee.  She brought us 2 more packets.  Very generous of her.

Their menu offers a choice of grits or potatoes.  When I asked our server how the potatoes are prepared (i.e., hash browns or home fries or what), she said, \"they're chunks of potato.\"  Well, doesn't that sound yummy!  Chunks!  I assumed they were home fries then, but I was wrong.  I'll get back to that later.

Before our food arrived, we were accosted by the very loud thumping of a bass.  Where it was coming from, I couldn't figure it out.  I thought there was someone being obnoxious in the parking lot.  No.  It was coming from the bar side of the restaurant.  They had the place thumping like a nightclub.  At 11AM.  With only 2 people in the bar (why?) and 2 tables in the restaurant.  I asked the maitre'd to turn it down.  It was really annoying.

I ordered 2 poached eggs with what I expected were home fries, along with bacon and toast.  My husband and his father ordered their eggs over easy.  My eggs were absolutely perfect, but the others were fried to within an inch of their lives.  Although the yolks were nice and runny, the whites were brown, crispy and curling at the edges.  Quite hideous.  Note to chef:  there is a difference between fried and over easy.  I did not get my bacon, but several perfectly cooked (the way I like it anyway) slices arrived in barely a minute.

Now, the \"chunks.\"  They were nothing more and nothing less than cubed, fried potatoes.  Not home fries.  Not hash browns.  Just cold, over-cooked, fries.  I don't know about you, but I can't do cold fries for breakfast.

I'm sorry, but I just will not be returning for breakfast.  Maybe lunch and dinner are good, and breakfast is just not their thing--I dunno.  I will be having breakfast at home or, better yet, at Cafe 49 just down the street a little ways.  Cafe 49 makes an excellent breakfast, with divine hash browns, and the best sausage links I've ever had.  Also very very affordable.  Service is just kinda slow, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of or ordering clams and then tried the Ceaser salad both were equally terrible. The service was great though! Our server was really nice and accommodating. All in all definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Best spaghetti and meatballs! Extremely friendly and personable staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I know this place has gotten pretty bad reviews but my experience was really pleasant.

First off I brought my dog, everyone loved him and he isn't this tiny poodle I can hold in my lap. We sat outside and the waitress put our game on the tv and was very nice to my dog. 

Second, the food I ordered was awesome. I didn't order anything fancy, but their pizza was great. Everyone agreed. I'm not sure why a \"sports bar\" has such fancy Italian food on the menu. But If they simplified it maybe more people would order what I had. I mean why go to a place to watch sports and eat manicotti??? It's Weird. 

Third, just a nice atmosphere. Really did enjoy my afternoon here. Hopefully more people give this place a chance. Stick to the bar food like pizza and beer. I mean really it's a sports bar why expect its Italian to be outstanding."}
{"text":"Went with my wife recently & she ordered scallops which, for this restaraunt, was an expensive item. They were the size of pencil erasers and over-cooked & rubbery with an \"odd taste\". After bringing this to the attention of the waitress (who was very nice) she told a manager. I was shocked to see the full price of the meal on my check! After telling the waitress again hoiw disappointed we were and that we would pay buy not be back...she told the manager again.
Received a whopping 30% off the dish. This despite the fact that my wife who loves scallops could only eat maybe 25% of them at most.
Will not be back despite the \"big\" discount."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and waaaaay overpriced. I would rate a 0."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a few friends and we all loved it.  I had shrimp and grits and it was amazing.  Perfect amount of spice and just enough sauce.  Service gave this place the 5th star and the food was a 4 star.  We will definitely be coming back to this place and possible making this a weekly meal."}
{"text":"Was pretty skeptical about coming here after seeing such bad reviews but my husband and I went for breakfast and the food was really good. Service was amazing and the atmosphere was very comfy! Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Enjoyed full continental breakfast.   Choice of number and style of eggs, sausage or bacon, toast, snd grits.  Filling and good basic breakfast.  Friendly staff.  Feels like eating at home."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.. But I wish they would just narrow down their menu a bit. And \"specialize\" is something! They offered breakfast, to burgers, pizzas, spaghetti, steaks and seafood. And it's a sport bar.. My head spins a bit when I look at their menu. And I can understand if all the food they offered are awesome. But a lot is just mediocre. 

Customer service: 3/5 it was late night when I came in. She looked annoyed.. That's all I have to say about that particular situation 

Restaurant: 4/5 it's a spacious place. It can hold a bit of ppl when there's an awesome game on.. Bar is nicely located which is the center. Give everybody access and many TVs all over. 

Food: 3/5 I order kids pizza for my son. As much as he love pizzas. He didn't care for theirs. That said a lot. Then I ordered him chicken Alfredo. The chicken was dry.. so of course he just pushes that to the side. I had some breakfast. Toast was burnt.. sunny side up eggs was ok. I'm glad they didn't mess that up. Bacon had some burnt, to crispy and some too soft. 

Honestly I haven't been back since.. But I alway keep an eye on it to see if it will be under new management or restaurant will go toward a new direction. Because I really feel they have potential!"}
{"text":"The good: awesome waitstaff and very nice bar atmosphere. The restaurant was very clean
The Bad: The food. Sorry, but what we ordered was not good at all."}
{"text":"Best food! Best atmosphere! We always love coming here for football games and after work dinners. We recommended the sliders and loaded fries."}
{"text":"I had the blackened tilapia  fish tacos and they were pretty good. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This was our fourth trip during the past 2 1/2 years that we have lived in this area.  The first was a disaster, but it underwent new management, and I must say that it has improved each time that we have been there.  We only go for dinner, so I don't know about the brunch.  The spinach artichoke dip was fantastic, as was the chicken contadina.  My husband ordered a ribeye, and I assume it was good because he didn't complain, and ate it all.  We had a great waitress who went above and beyond to make our evening with our three children enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the bad reviews. I frequent Grid Iron. The staff is friendly. Food is good, and comes out hot. My mom loves the Alfredo. I typically get the fried flounder or the grid iron burger. Sometimes you just have to experience things for yourself. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"This place won't be around for too much longer I'm sure. The service was horrible and very slooooowwww. As others have said, you pay for upscale food but the food itself is nothing spectacular at all. I found the menu to be a little odd, and and for a restaurant labeled as a \"grid iron\" I expected to see more steak options than were available. Save your $$ and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and today was the worst!  The breakfast is at least edible, but this time, we had the salmon and it was like it was microwaved... very tough and rubbery.  The vegetables were not fresh and greasy. I just can't believe how awful it was.  My son however, die enjoy his meal which he had the ravioli's and ha had garlic bread on the side.  So the only redeeming quality is that the kids meal came free.  Otherwise, it was not worth the 17 dollars for the salmon meal.  Should have listened to my gut and gone to Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"No stars would be correct. You are paying for upper scale restaurant price and in return day old McDonald's. That's how awful our meal was and it seemed like no staff member cared whether you liked it or not."}
{"text":"I had a bowl of their French Onion Soup. At $6 it was a complete rip off. The portion was very small and the cheese was not toasted, it was like they just put a glob of cheese in the bowl along with one crouton. Oddly enough, it tasted good. I would not order it again, though. 

My friend and I shared the artichoke and spinach dip. It was very good as were the pita chips only they were not 'normal' chips, they were much better. We also shared the mozzerella sticks and they were really good. It was obvious they were hand battered and not frozen. The dipping sauce was okay. 

Our service was excellent but it was also not busy whatsoever because we came at sort of an odd time."}
{"text":"Decent service, the food is horrible, like so bad I have no idea how they are able to continue selling it, when these folks owned papa penos the food was just as bad, again real confused how they are able to do what they do. 
I give them a one because they actually have the ability to serve semi cold beer, limited selection.  
I've come to realize there are a ton of places like this who cater to the younger crowd, not sure if that's fair but it is what it is. 
The original grid iron had very good food, this place is ruining that good name. 
To many better places within a stones throw of this place that actually serve good food."}
{"text":"The place is nice on inside. Our waitress was very friendly but slow.  Food is over priced and not very good.  All 4 in our party wasn't pleased with the food.  And I ended up with an upset stomach all night.  The Parking lot is always full but isn't for the food - they are all at the bar.  Drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go!"}
{"text":"1 star for service
3 stars for food

Evidently this place used to be very good.  The boyfriend lives down the street and we went for breakfast today.  He wanted to see what it was like with the new ownership.  Well........my breakfast was OK, but its obvious this place is being run into the ground, again.

The prices are reasonable, that's a positive.  

The service was terrible.  We had to stand in the lobby for at least 5 minutes waiting to be seated....now I wasn't bothered too much b/c we had several servers and the manager promise to be with us shortly - so we weren't ignored.  

The manager seated us and told us she'd be taking our drink order b/c our server was 'tied up'.  She was pleasant and brought us our drinks on a tray...she apologized b/c she wasn't used to doing drinks...she then left our drinks on the table, ON THE TRAY.  It was kinda funny.  

Enter our server.  He was, well, creepy and had to be tripping on something.  Like seriously, dude was either on something, or *should* be on something.  It was unnerving how out of it he was.  Ugh.

My waffle was good and the bacon was perfectly cooked.  The hashbrowns were also on point.  I subbed out fruit for eggs...all of that was only 8.95.

Boyfriend ordered scrambled eggs with cheese...what he got was a mound of scrambled eggs with a slice of un-melted cheese on top.  They should also be ashamed at what they called sausage...it was burnt an curled up an just looked awful.  

Suffice it to say  we will not be back."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night and meh. Our waiter Michael was very nice and attentive but the food was not so hot. My husbands reuben was an oily mess and my vegetables had no flavor. The salmon was okay; definitely a frozen filet. It wasn't inedible but just meh. We won't return."}
{"text":"Me and my husband ate dinner here with our 16 month old daughter on 7/15/16.  The food was decent, and the atmosphere was ok.  But the issue was that the waitress charged us for our daughters kids meal! It's widely advertised and promoted within the restaurant that kids meals are free and includes a dessert.  When we questioned the charge for the kids meal, the waitress act liked we were making it up that kids eat free...as if we did not want to pay!! And we never received her dessert either! With the way we were treated, we will NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You should light this place up for the holidays!!  No one else has lights in the area, they would attract some more business from people driving by!"}
{"text":"Baked ziti was great! I love that kids eat free... That's a bonus.  my server Christine was freaking awesome... my kids love it and they were actually well behaved in a restaurant (about time)...so it's a winner for me...I Will be back...!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and cold beer with exceptional service.  Quay was the best server we've had since moving to Charlotte.  The western burger was Tha Bomb!"}
{"text":"Didn't like it! We ordered breakfast from this place and my French toast was very soggy... There was no one there to greet us at the front entrance, the waitress was very nice but I could get over the out dated decor... My eggs was a little dry and they put way to much powered sugar on my French toast.

As far as I am concerned I will not be returning back to this place. Sorry but you guys deserve a -1."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  Apparently back in the day, this joint used to be a happening establishment, but a series of ownership changes, road realignments, and some bad luck changed all that.  

We actually moved in across the street over a year ago, but poor reviews kept us away until we popped in by chance to get a beer.  Once we were there, it was love at first site.

I love the folks who run the bar area here.  They are some of the most personable people you'll meet.  They love their beer and mixed drinks and they love to discuss the drinks you like.  In point of fact, I'm convinced a few beers are on tap because we expressed an interest in drinking them regularly.

As far as the food, we've had the pizza.  Love it.  Also had a few appetizers and we weren't disappointed.  We have not eaten in the restaurant portion yet, but I'm happy hanging in the bar and enjoying the 10 TV's, music, and TouchTunes.  

Love, love love the environment. My only criticism is I'd like still more craft beer to make this my main goto joint.  Until then I'll only be coming occasionally. But when I do come, I know I'll be enjoying myself"}
{"text":"Stopped in here ..have not been in 4 years.. Really a nice decorated place .. Food was good .. Two of my party had hamburgers and loved them.. juicy, cheesey and fresh. One had Manicotti. she said it was good and it was a vegetarian offering. I had the Manzo Beef sandwich, pretty good sliced steak with cheese and peppers but was a little dry till the waitress brought the aujus..By the way April the waitress was absolutely one of the best servers ever !"}
{"text":"So we had our rehearsal dinner here, that my mother in law had planned for months. So we had the private room for us. First they didn't have a menu with our selections so my mother in law had to make one just so we knew what options we had. We started by ordering drinks, and it seemed ok. Until some people had not got their drinks after 10-15 mins. Then the appetizers came and that is when the waiter came to take our orders. There was 2 waiters serving all of us. We had been done with our appetizers for about 45 mins before we got our salads and then it took 30 more minutes before we got our dinner. Some of our friends didn't even get there food until about 30 mins after the first person got their meal. It was taking forever to get our food and drinks. We had to re ordering drinks since they kept forgetting about them. You would think since they knew about our group coming that they would be more prepared and have prepped or got more wait staff to help us. It was extremely frustrating that it took so long so food and drinks to get to us. Also when we complained they didn't even apologize and just took 2 meals off which with the money we spent with them was nothing. It was super disappointing to have that kind of service for what was suppose to be such a fun event!!"}
{"text":"OK... whenever I see a one or two star review I read the reviews with skepticism but, after eating here, I have to concur with the reviews.

#1. Grid Iron splashes \"Italian Food\" everywhere and I was expecting good food. Instead, I got tasteless, bland marinara, factory-created breaded chicken, and bland spaghetti... I know good Italian and this ain't it... I guess there's a reason they provide jars of Italian seasoning, pepper flakes, and parmesan,,, it needs it ALL,

#2. Beer and service are AOK so come to this place for the sports TV and non-Italian food..."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty decent back in the day when it was a real sports bar. Now it's the unholy marriage of a failed sports bar and a family run \"American\" Italian eatery. 

The food is barely passable."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast here with  friends at their suggestion. Big mistake. I will not return. My eggs were cold, grits were hard-had to send back. Service was SLOW and the restaurant was not crowded.  The server kept forgetting to bring  requested items, mixed everyone's orders up. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Reader's digest: Hickory Tavern is across the street. Advertised as Italian, Olive Garden should be offended. Calamari was overdone, tough and greasy and the marinara is out of a can for sure. Side salad was wilted, tomatoes had green cores. Grid iron shrimp was all lemon juice and spaghetti. Veggie calzone was 80% bread, 19% ricotta and 1% tomato and banana peppers. On top of it all, we had a 50% off coupon for second entree that they didn't honor because \"the calzone did not come with a salad\".  Did not stick around to argue. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"You gotta check this place out on a Fri-Mon night, Tiffany is a great bartender, with all kinds of personality and looks that could kill.  I often have dinner here as well, some of my favorites are the Chicken Parm, Penne ala Vodka, and Lasagna.  Nice family owned Italian restaurant, with plenty of TVs in the bar area for your favorites sporting event."}
{"text":"I would strongly advise against eating here but it is an ok bar. 

This is one of the places that is within walking distance of my new house and I was excited to try them out. I ordered the salmon and could not have been more disappointed with the plate that came out. The salmon was way over seasoned, over cooked and had a suspicious smell. The veggies were almost raw and unseasoned. The mashed potatoes at least were passable. To her credit the waitress noticed that I didn't touch my salmon (though I did eat the potatoes and veggies) and offered to bring me something else. At that point my group was done eating and after the disaster salmon I didn't trust that the next dish would be an improvement but they get credit for the offer. 

We stayed for a bit to check out the bar scene. On Friday nights they do beer pong tournaments which looked fun and the bartender was prompt and friendly with the drink orders. But without anything in particular to recommend the bar we left early.

Since it is so close I will probably return for drinks but not food."}
{"text":"Rude Staff! 
A friend and I went to Grid Iron for the first time this weekend for breakfast. The restaurant looked half empty, we kindly asked the hostess for a booth. She abruptly said none were available and sat us at table right in front of the entrance. Mind you, its mid winter and the doors were opening and closing bringing in the cold air. My friend noticed another customer being sat at a booth by the same hostess. When the waitress came and got our drink orders, we kindly asked if any booths or tables had opened up because we were cold and did not want to sit by the door. The waitress went to the hostess and a few seconds later came back and said there were none--then the hostess came to our table and snapped at us \"I THOUGHT I EXPLAINED THERE WERE NO BOOTHS\". We told her we were cold and was hoping to be relocated to a different table at least. She ignored us and walked off. She had no right snapping at us. I also want to note, both my friend and I used to be servers at a restaurant for 8+ years, so we know how customers can get, but asking for a different table should have never been an argument. We did not get to try any food because we left after her rude behavior. I hope management sees this review and reacts accordingly."}
{"text":"Just wanted to share my lunch experience...

As usual we had a ladies lunch with just a couple of girlfriends and met at The Grid Iron on the corner of Hwy 49 & Steele Creek Road (Hwy 160).  Before we ordered our server explained that one of the specials today was Bud on Draft for $1.00.  After our nice lunch when the bill came we were charged $3 for each draft and questioned our server about it.  She said she would get it changed.  Almost immediately she came back and said her manager refused to change our bill.  We asked to speak with him and he came up and when we tried to explain to him what we were told, he was so nasty and then finally said that he would charge the server for the overcharge if we didn't want to pay the full amount.  We explained that the price we were told (not asked about the cost but were told this was their draft special for today) he refused to even listen to what we tried to explain to him.  We did not want the server to be charged for this misunderstanding and explained to the manager/owner that we patronize The Grid Iron often and that if that was his only solution to the cost difference in the draft beer was to charge the server for it, we would not come back again.  His response was \"that's okay by me because I've been in business for over 40 years and you just have to lose some customers.\"  WOW, were we surprised at his attitude considering our lunch tab was well over $50 for a couple of girlfriends eating out.  Not many lunch tabs amount to that much.

We paid that tab as rung up not wanting to charge our server for a misunderstanding and left quite a nice tip for her as well since she really did try.

We were saying our goodbyes in the parking lot when to our surprise the manager/owner followed us out into the parking lot trying to confront us some more about the Bud on Draft situation.  We did not want to cause any further confrontation as we did not know this man, and did not know what he was capable of doing, so we all just decided to leave. 

It was quite the experience with this man, especially since there are quite a few restaurants right on this corner that serve a good lunch for our next girls day lunch and especially since our tab was over $50.

My advice, skip this place and head on over to Hickory Tavern, Wild Wing Café, Friday's or any of the other great restaurants just across the street."}
{"text":"On Fridays after work, my wife and I like to get a burger and a couple of good beers. It helps us unwind after a long week.  We live across the street and decided to give this place a try.

In short, my experience here was so bad that I didn't finish my burger or beer!

My Stella Artios tasted stale or soapy or something. Couldn't even finish it, which says a lot for Friday happy hour.

The burger was bland, the avocados were brown, and the onion rings were greasy! My wife ordered fruit with her dinner and got a packaged cup of peaches (like they give you in a cafeteria).

It's sad that the food is so bad. It's a fun place and the staff is friendly. 

Unfortunately, that's not enough to bring us back. There are 22 restaurants within walking distance of our apartment. I won't miss the Grid Iron one bit."}
{"text":"This rating is for breakfast only. I have only been here three times and they are all breakfasts. so I waited a whole year and a half before coming back. I had hopes (wish?) they had read some of the reviews and fixed what needed fixing. Well other than the service was faster this time around, nothing changed. The coffee is still terrible diluted watery coffee. The grits werent that good, the bacon was terrible (like bacon you get on a burger king burger) and the toast was burnt. Hey, the egg was good. I will leave it on that positive note, the egg was tasty ."}
{"text":"Came in when it was slow on a Sunday night. No one acknowledged the fact that we were just standing there in the front of the door. Employees had seen us but just continued their laughing and conversation. Then we late walked up to ask someone if it was \"seat yourself\" the server chuckled and said we're not suppose to be then later sat as us down. Took them 15 minutes just to get our water. Food was subpar and is NOT made to order. I was very disappointed in my first experience here and won't be back."}
{"text":"I have trouble with even one star.  Second time i have tried breakfast.   I try to give a place a chance but no more.  Tuesday morning, possibly three other tables so not even remotely busy.  Slow to seat, wait staff pleasant but slow.   Food was cold when served which means either sat there or not  kept at proper temps.   Forgot part of order to go with cold overeasy eggs so after inquiring 3 times where toast was had to rewarm overeasy eggs that were brought back completely well done no runny yolk to dip now cold toast  into. .really?  Ohh toast was barely toasted and cold as well.  Pitiful bacon...just not worth coming back.  Breakfast is not a complicated meal right?"}
{"text":"Great place! Beer pong, karaoke, good food...ask for my favorite server Noelle oer see my favorite bartender Sarah...Even thou Noell wasn't our server still paid attention and asked us how we were doing! Chicken finger were moist, flaky and had the perfect seasoning."}
{"text":"What a great inexpensive little spot for breakfast and/or drinks. I live in uptown, so it's refreshing to have a good place to come and eat that doesn't break the bank. The service was really good and the food was really good too. It's a nice hometown feeling inside, we will return."}
{"text":"Yeah so the food sucks! It's like they offer so many options, American, Italian, Seafood but nothing is good! We're new to the area so ordered take out the other day, I got spaghetti and my husband got seafood and neither one of us liked our food. It was so bad I couldn't even finish it and what's with the seafood coming with a side of spaghetti? Yeah cause that really goes together?!  The place sucks, avoid if you want good food you could have made yourself at home"}
{"text":"We had lunch and I ordered the small spinach +ham calzone. It was so big that I had to share with my mom. We also shared a caesar salad. I must say that our calzone was one of the best I have ever tasted! It was a bit of wait and I was about to complain but once it came to our table, we were in heaven. It was made from scratch and it was DELICIOUS! My stepdad ordered the meaty calzone and it also tasted amazing! Our waiter was friendly and tended to us twice. No errors in our order and he highly suggested the lasagna. He spoke proudly of the owners coming from Italy and having amazing Italian recipes. He received a nice big tip from us. The restaurant was pretty cool and decorated very sporty. It was very clean and welcoming. The prices were reasonable and well worth the wait. We will definitely return for the lasagna!"}
{"text":"The food was good   Nothing to brag about. The service was great.  I passed this place a few times and finally came in."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and can't believe how low the rating was. We had a good experience minus the patron who continued to try to talk to us while we were enjoying our conversation. Not a big deal. We all opted for the burgers. My burger was perfect! They waitress brought over a pitcher of water, which I love because I drink a lot of water during a meal. The experience was great and the food was great."}
{"text":"So with all the horrible reviews on yelp i was afraid for my life lol. I didn't check yelp until we were already here and sitting down and ordering our food. Came here thinking we were going to get some breakfast but i guess we were to late for that train so we just ordered the regular bar type food they sale here. We all decided to play it safe and get simple meals off the menu. My daughter ordered a pizza and my boyfriend and I ordered the classic burgers with fries.The fries were pretty good and the burger was ok. With all that being said we didn't die the reviews here on yelp for this place is very very scary for the most part. It made it worse when we were talking to the waitress and asked about what were some of the things that were good there she named for the most part the pastas, when we asked about the burgers she mentioned well i not many people order the burgers the last time the cook made burgers was to feed to the dogs. Boy did our eyes get big like what the heck. Hilarious and scary at the same time but im glad we just all played it safe and ordered all of the what was to us the safe food. Although it was ok i don't really think this would be a place i would actually return to but the food is nothing like alot are describing in the reviews. Might i add our waitress was sweet as pie!"}
