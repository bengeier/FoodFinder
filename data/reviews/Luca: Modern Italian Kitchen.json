{"text":"Great bar and great specials!  The menu is fantastic. I love the fried risotto balls with short ribs!  (Aracini Alla Siciliana)."}
{"text":"We loved our dinner here tonight. We chose to split several items. Would highly recommend the meatballs and the gnocchi. Bartender's Whimsey was also delicious and a fun way to order a drink. The service was excellent. It made for a perfect date night!"}
{"text":"Service was quite slow and the place was not busy.  Had to request assistance and remind our waitress of menu items.  When the food finally came, it was pretty good, but instead of writing home about it - I might just send a postcard instead!  Okay food - not worth going back.  Almost like a restaurant pretending to be fancy."}
{"text":"Smart move rebranding to Luca from Passion8. The Chef knows his way around the kitchen, and is great at creating his own spin on classic Italian fare. The calamari was excellent, as was the veal romano & rigatoni with sausage & pesto. Pasts are house made, and Jessica made us feel at home, so we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Luca, Jessica and team made us feel at home as soon as we walked in the door. Food was amazing!  This isn't just your average Italian restaurant it is the complete experience. Food , ambiance,service all get and \"A\".  You can tell that Luca and Jessica put there complete heart  and soul into there Business and It shows, and for that they will always have my family's business. Thank you Luca and Jessica!"}
{"text":"After eating at this restaurant last night, this restaurant becomes our favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte.
You can find street parking around or there is a lot across from the Viva chicken.
The ambiance is perfect and the people are very friendly.
The Pulpo (grilled octopus) is a good way to start your meal. We had the sea bass and mussels. Both are beautifully presented and they are very delicious.
Don't forget to finish your night with the spring berry panna cotta. They do not use gelatin so it was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"I had the absolute honor to dine at Luca during Yelp Restaurant Week with my husband and another couple. So sad that we finally discovered this place the day they announced they were closing! Elizabeth is definitely losing a great restaurant.

Our waiter Brian was absolutely fantastic. Exciting, engaging, and attentive. We loved chatting with him!

Our group started off with a bottle of Chianto Classico Reserva. Delish! We then each had a Fagottini (stuffed pockets of lobster, squash, vodka sauce goodness) and the calamari to split. Both were fantastic. The sauce on the calamari made the dish! The Fagottini was decadent and so flavorful. Next we ordered the antipasto alla Luca. I loved the presentation and all the different flavor combos that could be made. The olives were delish! Lastly, we orderd the double portion of the Bucatini. The pasta was cooked so well and the sauce was super flavorful.

Overall, fantastic evening with delicious food, spot on service, and great company! 

Luca, you will be missed!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Luca tonight. The atmosphere was great and so was the food. I tried the calamari and the lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thankfully a recent online article led us to the newly branded Luca ristorante and after our first visit- it definitely won't be our last. The decor is warm and romantic with a very low noise level. Luca is a perfect place for a date or impressing visitors.
Jeff, our server, was pleasant and professional. The kitchen staff is equally professional delivering high quality, perfectly prepared dishes. 
The menu has some logic which Jeff took us through. Every dish we had was just the right portion and absolutely delicious. Highly recommended are the polenta fries with aioli, baked eggs in tomato sauce (I could eat this every day), scallops with butternut squash veloute', and panna cotta with the incredible berry compote that has a wonderful note of fresh mint.
Luca Modern Italian Kitchen is now on our top 5 list and a true gem of Charlotte. Motto ben fatto!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner last night at Luca.  There were eleven of us at the Chef's Table and every one of the seven courses was magnificent!  So delicious and beautifully presented.  It was a very special experience.  I wish I had taken photos. 
From soup to dessert, every bite was delectable. The scallops were cooked to perfection, the pork belly with gnocchi was great,  the raviolone al uvo was such a special treat, and the wild boar was awesome.  We had great service and great Italian wine.  Everyone in our group just raved about the food, the ambience, Chef Luca, and the staff.  It really was fantastic.  We will all be back soon."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick meal of small plates in this neighborhood and did not now of any options so we selected Luca to try it out. We wound up sitting at the bar and splitting a few plates and a bottle of wine that was recommended to us by the owner. What a fantastic experience and incredible meal. They also told us that the menu would be changing very soon so we are excited to go back to try out the new offerings. Beautiful surroundings, great people, and incredible food and wine...doesn't get much better. I would call it the best Italian restaurant we have visited in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! The chef came out to personally speak to us! Food was delicious. The Grinada drink with limoncello is a must!! And the gelato. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food at  unbelievable prices! Did I mention the cocktails are to die for. I went to celebrate my husband's birthday with some friends. Everyone loved the food and the service was incredible! Thank you!"}
{"text":"True Italian food - both traditional and inventive - using farm fresh ingredients.  Jessica and Luca are warm and welcoming. Varied menu with a few surprises. Everything was delicious. Don't miss Luca's take on caprese salad or his tomato sauce and fresh pasta."}
{"text":"Party of 8. Here are the facts from our visit. The good: food was pretty good - not extraordinary - we tried many different things and while the portions were very small  (tapas sharing), almost everything we ordered was tasty. The bad: service was the worst we've experienced in years. Inattentive server who sporadically appeared, difficult to get refills and drink orders (from the time we were seated, it took 40 minutes to get our first drink). The ugly: management's view of customer service. We were overcharged (I hope by accident). We later notified the restaurant. Response times were generally two days. They agreed to credit our card but instead actually charged us for the meal again so we paid twice (without authorizing). Unfortunately, the restaurant stopped responding to our requests to resolve the issue, and we had to contact the credit card company to take care of it ."}
{"text":"Hopeful that this was going to be a great dining experience, we booked a reservation for Valentine's Day dinner. On arrival, the restaurant looks nice and the downstairs area is attractive. However, we were taken to the upstairs loft area which is without much character or lighting. Surprisingly, for Valentine's Day, the restaurant was not very busy. After our experience, I think I know why. We were given a pre fixe menu, which I was totally unaware at the time of reservation, would be our only option. For an Italian Kitchen, the menu was heavy on the meat selections and really no pasta options unless a seafood ravioli was on your agenda. Our server was new and was pleasant, but from the time he took our drink order (a beer and a glass of wine) it took almost 30 minutes to get them. We ordered the osso bucco and the surf & turf for our meals. It was another 30 minutes waiting to receive our entrees. The pork dish was excellent both in taste and presentation. The filet was way undercooked and sent back once to attempt for a true medium rare piece to be returned. The steak was returned warmer, but still extremely rare. At this point, we had already waited forever to get our food and were not sending it back again. We picked at and ate the cooked areas of the steak. When were were done eating, our server confirmed we were finished and walked away...the dirty dishes were never removed from our table. Not wanting to be there any longer, we asked for our dessert to go. Desert selections for the evening were a chocolate cake and a fruit and cheese selection with crackers. We ordered one of each. The best part had to be getting home and seeing two crackers and three dried out pieces of cheese in a large plastic to go container and a tragic looking piece of chocolate cake. The whole experience was very disappointing. The restaurant is way overpriced for what you actually get, (two pre fixe, 3 course meals and two drinks)and they desperately need to work on how long it takes to get the items ordered to your table. One decent entr√©e does not make up for all of the negative. I have no idea how they have a 4 star rating! Although we would like to give it another try sometime, it is unlikely that we will. I can think of several other places I would happily spend $180 dollars for a guaranteed wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party at Lucas. Chef luca and John made sure that everything went perfectly. They were so friendly and did everything to accommodate our needs and budget. We were able to do a menu that worked for everyone including vegetarians and gluten free eaters. The food was absolutely delicious, our waiters were attentive, and the night went off without a hitch. I recommend you have your private event here or just have dinner here cause it's the best."}
{"text":"Luca was a great place, the modern atmosphere was perfect. We walked in had reservations and the hostess was not friendly, she could barley look up from her iPad  when we walked in. A couple walked in and she sat before us. ( we were a part of 4) 
The waiter was great at knowing the menu and upwelling. The food was perfect. We started with the beans and the calamari was a must have. We have the eggplant which I wouldn't order again. The end piece were tough and the dish was just ok. The fish was excellent! The rigatoni with Bolognese sauce was fabulous.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I would give this a one star instead of a two but my boyfriend claims his veal was at least tasty. I came here for dinner with my parents and him and had high hopes. We ordered two branzino whole fishes, veal, and the chicken with sausage and rosemary gravy along with two sides to share for the table. Our waiter was odd and we chalked it up to him being new most likely. He was not attentive but that was okay. He brought us a plate of bread - two pieces for four people. Over 45 minutes later two of our entrees finally came. Over five minutes later, the last two fish dishes came out. The waiter and female manager/owner \"filleted\" the whole fishes for five more minutes while the other two dishes sat on the table (we weren't about to eat those when my parents were waiting on their fish). They butchered the fish into tiny mutilated pieces and served them. Finally after about an hour after being seated we could eat... but we also were told the sides were never put in and they would start making them now.
The fish was pretty cold though fresh. The chicken was TERRIBLE. It was dry and there was no sausage. When the female owner/manager came to apologize about the sides I said the chicken was very dry and there was no sausage, was it even the right chicken? She said yes and brought some sausage pieces for me to add. The sausage was good but there was not a hint of it in the original dish. The chicken was edible with it but still dry and much worse than what I cook for myself at home. I was surprised but how cold the female owner/manager was when I said that the chicken was dry and did not taste like the correct dish. You would think that after messing up with timing and never even putting in our side orders she would at least be more apologetic. 
I thought that I could give this place another chance in a month once they get their bearings but asked and apparently it has been open as Luca since March! This kind of terrible service and disgusting chicken will make me never come back. But as I said originally, my boyfriend said the veal was good so I guess I will leave this as a two star."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance were amazing! Luca and Drew were so accommodating. We had some gluten free guests in our group and they couldn't have been more helpful with the menu! Would recommend it to anyone who likes authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"This past week was Yelp Restaurant week and some selected restaurants were offering 30% off their meals. Luca was one of the participating restaurants.
Looking at their dishes pictures here at Yelp it got me really interested and checking them out. My husband made reservation on open table and we went. We got there relatively early for dinner around 5:40, however we were not the only early birds on the house. I don't know what I was expecting, but the decoration surprised me. It is a very nice restaurants with interesting chandeliers, art and walls. Very romantic I would say.
From where we were sitting we could see the kitchen and the chef cooking, it is not every day you have this kind of experience!
The first waiter who came to us was really kind, he explained the menu, made some suggestions and said our waiter for the night would be someone else, which was kind of a bummer because the other waiter wasn't half nice the first one was.
My husband got the fried calamari and I got the arancins ball. the calamari was great! Cooked to perfection (it is really hard to cook calamari without overcooking it), the heat of the jalape√±o and the sweet of the honey was on point. My arancini was just fine, nothing special about it. As main course I had the Osso Bucco with tomato risotto, the osso bucco was good, was melting, however I felt like it was missing more seasoning and my risotto was not good at all. I was raised with Italians, eating Italian food every week and also worked as a chef assistant in an Italian restaurant for a while and I can tell you that I was really disappointed with that risotto.
My husband had the ravioli caprese that was undercooked and the Gamberi Oreganata al Forno, the shrimp as the calamari was cooked to perfection and my husband really enjoyed this dish.
Overall I was disappointed because I really was expecting way more from this place. Maybe I just picked a bad day to go, who knows? I guess unfortunately I will never know."}
{"text":"Just visited Luca for restaurant week and was impressed. The food was delish (I'm still thinking about the antipasto - I could eat this every day), the service and ambiance were pleasant and the Queen's Feast included a complimentary glass of prosecco. Wins all around."}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this place! The dining room was beautiful, waitress was pleasant but the food was so plain and bland that we will not be back. The appetizers loaded in sauce were okay. My husband had the veal and it was dry, tough and had almost no flavor. I had the scallops and they were just terrible...chewy and bland they came with a small drizzle of sweet potato and beans which were ok.  We were so hungry we ordered dessert which was just ok nothing special.  Now I understand why it was so empty all night."}
{"text":"We loved our dining experience at Luca's! We were escorted to a rather private table at the back of the restaurant, which we loved, and met our friends. As the 4 of us dined, we were actually able to converse without screaming! How refreshing! Our shared appetizers were delicious. The fried calamari is like none you've tasted. SO good! The Branzino fish and the ravioli dishes melted in our mouths. Our shared creme br√ªl√©e to finish the meal was amazing. We were able to interact with Chef/Owner Luca even though he was experiencing a very busy Saturday evening. He and his restaurant are a delight! Wonderful food in a lovely atmosphere. We \"fine dine\" often and really loved Luca's. A \"10\" all way round!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very pretty and service was excellent. The antipasti was great with buffalo mozz, olives, crostini, heirloom tomato and more. The pork medallions were juicy and had a good sauce but pork was a bit tough to cut. The trout was delicious. For dessert get the tiramisu."}
{"text":"This is my first review that I ever felt compelled to give a restaurant. I travel a minimum of three nights a week and all I do is eat at great restaurants. I ate at your place last night (restaurant week) place was packed. Had the short ribs. It's was three bones and fat period. Ask the manager to take off. I even said I would pay half the pasta was very good. She came to table with a major attitude and basically refused. Waitress was outstanding. I will never come back to this place. I will spread the word for sure."}
{"text":"We decided to come here during yelp restaurant week, such a cool concept! I've been hearing good things about this new Italian place so I had high expectations. Upon entering, the bar area is gorgeous and I love the lighting. We made reservations and the hostess was great, and it was not too crowded. However, we were seated at a table that was pretty close to the table behind us so that was slightly uncomfortable. 

Our waiter Matt was great, he recommended items and explained the menu and a recommended a great bottle of wine. There were some long waits between when we saw him, so I think he was slightly over assigned tables, but it wasn't horrible. The first dish we ordered was amazing, the fried risotto ball. I could have eaten 10 of them! Unfortunately I think that was my favorite dish. We both ordered salads and they were fine. For main dishes I ordered the chicken and hubs got lasagna and the fettuccini Alfredo. The chicken tasted great, but I feel like I could have made it at home. The lasagna was excellent and the fettuccini Alfredo was rich and delicious. They gave us the mushrooms on the side (because hubs hates them) and they were amazing.

Dessert we ordered the chocolate pizza and it was extremely disappointing. Very rubbery and not worth the calories. 

Overall had a great time. I'm not sure I would make the trek up again from ballantyne for date night but I would definitely go back if I were in the area. So fun to try new places for yelp restaurant week!"}
{"text":"So I went to Luca during Yelps restaurant week and received 30 percent off my food order. It was a great way to try a new restaurant. I'm sad to report that the day I tried it, they announced they are closing on April 1st. So glad I tried it though.  If you have time, I would check it out before they close on April 1st. You definitely want to order their famous calamari. I really didn't understand how calamari could be so famous or special but wow was it amazing. It's a huge serving and it comes tossed in some sort of honey, lime and jalape√±o sauce. By far the best thing we had all night.  The menu is mainly small plates so we split two small plates and an appetizer. We tried the burrata because of how it was described to us by the waiter however, it was nothing like the waiter described and we both disliked it. It was basically one type of cheese stuffed inside another type of cheese served on top of some tomato chunks.  It was very very cold and not good at all. When we asked our waiter if it was supposed to come out hot like the way he originally described it to us, he couldn't give us an answer. That was the odd part about dinner. We also shared a pasta with homemade pasta, shrimp, mussels, crab, clams and garlic. It was very good and I would eat it again. The pasta was a little too al dente for my liking. 

Was super disappointed in their dessert selection. All we wanted was a cannoli and they didn't have any so we skipped dessert. 

It's a very darkly lit place and they actually turned the lights down even lower later into our dinner.  Tons of parking available across the street.  Sad to see this place go. Check it out while you can!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars but this place deserves it. We love the atmosphere dark and just nicely decorated. Also, on open table you can reserve seating anywhere in the restaurant including the bar itself and the bar area which is awesome.  The wine menu is very unique and outstanding. We werent sure on most of the bottles and then John the asst gm came over and went over and beyond to help us find the perfect bottle. Me being Italian i am veryyyyyy picky about my Italian food and this place is incredible. Chef, keep putting out high quality dishes like that and you will habe the best place in Charlotte. All pastas are home made, they have small plates which are incredible.  We ate there last night and we are going again tonight.  Our new favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Awesome! This is simply the best Italian in Charlotte! Beautiful space lovely menu great cocktails - how can you possibly go wrong!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Luca's Kitchen, Wow what can I say, other than Bellisimo! New menu that just started this week, Great Servers, who explain a little history about Luca and his background and his philosophy on cooking!  We started out with the Calamari, which is one of our favorites from the old menu - its done with a light crisp coating and drizzled in Jalapeno Honey. We than had the Arrancini alla Sicilian which was a  beautiful rice ball in a cream sauce. We also had the most wonderful Polenta fries with a incredible Garlic Aioli !  For our Main Course I ordered the Bistecca alla Don Corleone, which was  a Grilled Rib Eye Topped with Breadcrumbs, Capers, Anchovies, Herbed Red Wine Roasted Tomatoes.Perfect grilled steak, medium rare that was so tasty!  My husband had the Ravioli Caprese, Stuffed with Ricotta Cheese, San Marzano Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil Sauce. Both the Steak and Ravioli had the most delicious tiny tiny cherry tomatoes pan sauteed on the top of them.   Other family had the Lasagna and the Fettuccine which were both very Italian and Very delicious. For Dessert I had the Pannacotta which was topped with a Bruleed Slice of Orange ( incredible ) and Blueberries!  Everyone enjoyed their dinner immensely. The service and the food were just so delicious, This new menu is a keeper, I love the ability to have a large or small plate to share or to keep to myself!! I would eat there every night if I could!   Please go see Chef Luca and his wife Jessica!"}
{"text":"I'm forced to give this restaurant 1-Star, but in all actuality it deserves 0 stars.

I'm not sure I've ever had a worse dining experience in Charlotte. The only thing worse than the service was the food. 

Everybody has a bad night, but this was beyond bad. 

I wanted to love it...but unfortunately I'll never be back. There are too many places that serve and deliver a better product. 

Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Luca's with high expectations, but left somewhat disappointed after a meal that was lacking the flavor and zest that one should expect from a great Italian restaurant. We started with a bowl of their Infamous Calamari, which was delicious (but maybe a bit too spicy) and an order of their Mozzarella Ball Antipasti, which was tasty, but not quite as incredible as our server led us to believe.

For dinner, we shared a plate of Scaloppine di Aitellina alla Romana, a veal with prosciutto and sage in a mushroom and Prosecco pan sauce. The sauce was OK, but the veal itself was tough and lacking in flavor. We also shared a dish of Gnocchi alla Sorrentina, which was also somewhat disappointing, baked in a red sauce that could've used more zest. For dessert, we shared an Chocolate Torte that was tasty, but nothing to write home about.

The service was outstanding, and our waitress helped us select an excellent Italian blend for our meal. The atmosphere itself is wonderful - warm and intimate without being too stuffy -- and parking is conveniently available in a public lot across 4th Street. I really wanted to love this restaurant, but for the price (more than $150 before tip), it was decidedly underwhelming."}
{"text":"Went here for Yelp Restaurant Week and had a great meal.  What was so great about YRW is that it's not prefixed and the restaurant really \"showed us what they got\" (any Rick and Morty fans out there).

Anyways, we had a large table of 8, but our server Matt was great and we had a really fun, really delicious meal.  We shared the Fagottini Mare e Monte (stuffed crepe purses of lobster and squash in a vodka sauce), Calamari Famosi (only menu item from Passion8), and the Polpettine di Agnello (lamp meat balls).  Our mains, were also shared:  Fettucine con Prosciutto Cotto, Funghi, Piselli e Gorgonzola, Lasanga, and the Caposante in Padella (gianormous diver scallops on top of squid ink gnocchi saut√©ed mushroom and spinach, saffron, and a beurre blanc).

Chef Luca also sent out the antipasto alla Luca and we got to try the chocolate pizza, gelato, and their semifredo.... all of which were delicious and beautiful to look at.

Thank you to Matt and the GM John who made our experience one to remember.  The staff also helped bring out dishes and keep our drinks flowing-thank you thank you!

I'm so so sad that this place is closing:
http://www.charlottemagazine.com/Charlotte-Magazine/April-2018/Luca-Modern-Italian-Kitchen-Closing/
The Elizabeth strip is losing a great restaurant, but I totally understand that Chef Luca and his wife have been at it for so long and have other pursuits to tackle.  Best of luck to you guys and hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic meal/experience, and I can't recommend this restaurant enough!!  love the new concept and we were fortunate enough to meet one of the owners while we were at the bar waiting on a table, who had such enthusiasm for the food and did not led us astray with recommendations!! Wine was great, but cocktails are a must!! My husband had the 'bartenders whimsy' and the hibiscus whiskey drink that was made for him was out of this world.  We had small plates: the antipasta board, stuffed zucchini blossoms, cannelloni, and pesto pasta (can't remember name of this one but it was our favorite). Definitely going to make this a regular place on our list!"}
{"text":"First off a couple of disclaimers:

1. I rarely participate in restaurant week because most restaurants are slammed, prep much of their RW food in advance and you don't usually catch the service at it's best and 2. I rarely review places based on special events like restaurant week because of #1.

...but this experience was so different than a normal restaurant week experience that I had to write about it.

I had scheduled a dinner with my dinner group here as a last minute idea while texting one of our members. The fact that it was restaurant week completely slipped my mind. But we kept the reservation anyway. This was only the 2nd time in our 7 1/2 years of existence that we did Restaurant week.

When we got to the restaurant, we had 6 people, 2 people less than our reservation of 8. I mentioned this to the hostess so we wouldn't inconvenience them by taking up a larger table. When we were seated, we were led to the Chef's Table, right next to kitchen. Wow, this was unexpected and little did we know what sort of treat we were in for.

Our waiter, Jacob started us out by explaining the menu. There were Restaurant Week selections but then they also had other options from their new seasonal menu which will be released in its entirity after RW. All of our table desided to do the restaurant week options. For some of the selections, Jacob explained each option perfectly. 

As an appetizer we were treated with a sampling of lobster risotto balls which were delicious. It was like an Italian hush puppy. Then the first course came out. I had the antipasto which came with fresh locally made mozzarella, proscuitto and vegetable options and a small salad. The manager delivered my 1st course and told the story of how the mozzarella is made and how it is meant to be eaten - just picked up in one piece and not cut into with a knife. When you do this you are treated with the brine of the cheese. Other people at my table raved about the lamb meatballs and the ravioli.

Someone had ordered the Caprese salad. This is not your normal caprese salad of just tomatoes and mozzarella. This is Luca's southern inspired Caprese with a fried green tomato covered in fresh cheese that doubles as a delicious sauce. Amazing! 

For a second course, people at our table ordered the Caserecce Nere ai Frutti di Mar, the Trout and the Pork Medalions. Everyone was amazed by the care taken and presentation of each dish and the of course, the taste.

For dessert, the tiramisu and the gelato were both hits at our table. We were told the tiramisu is a special dessert just for RW.

If eating a fantastic dinner at the Chef's Table, watching Luca himself cook wasnt enought, we were also treated to short visits by Luca to our table during the dinner and then a good 30 minute conversation after our dinner talking about his background, his work experience, his staff, his work ethic and how he wanted to make RW at his place different from just a protein, broccoli rabe and a starch.

Luca's stories were amazing. His staff is amazing and this Restaurant Week experience was superb! In the 7 1/2 years of my dinner group's existence, this was the best restaurant experience we've ever had. 

We will definitely be back! How does next week sound?"}
{"text":"I have been wanting Italian for a while now. I'm glad I made Luca my first choice. Went there during Yelp restaurant week and got 30% off what was already a nicely priced menu. I started with the Arancini risotto ball and then had the Osso Buco both were excellent. Kelly the bartender was super nice and provided great service. She suggested a great red wine with my Osso Buco and topped it all off with a sambuca. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We popped into Luca, partially because we had previously been to Passion8, partially because I have problems with dates, and thought that this was the time they were doing the Yelp Restaurant Week (nope, that's next month) and partially because we were looking for someplace we hadn't been.

As has been mentioned, the decor is excellent, which sets the mood off well. In fact, being so close to Carpe Diem, it's a bit of a challenge right away, but they hold their ground well on that front. The staff also mostly rises to the occasion, and though at first they were a bit puzzled by my asking about it being Yelp Restaurant Week, they handled it in stride, and were careful not to point out my mistake too often, so no worries there.

We were really only stopping in for a few bites rather than a full-fledged dinner, but were assured that actually many folks take this approach, and we were comforted in this news. We were in fact happy to see that a number of dishes would fit our needs well, so we ordered a few of them, and were generally happy with the results. The main thing that we ran into was that though they were all \"small\" plates, the portions were significantly different in their sizes.

For instance, the stuffed pepper had little consistency, and as such it took about two bites to eat. Barely something for one, much less an item to be shared. The risotto balls were slightly more than that, though contained more of the fried outside than the short ribs mentioned in the menu, and again would do perhaps for one, but are not great for sharing.

Meanwhile, the calamari - admittedly, found in \"antipasti\", not \"tapas\" -
 was a nice bowl (huge even), and took a good deal longer to work through. Definitely worth the investment, even for two people. Oddly enough, the menu mentioned a jalapeno honey citrus butter, but most of that collected on the bottom of the bowl, so what little was there ended up creating an odd mess with the pieces that were at the bottom of the bowl, rather than being something you could taste on the rest of the calamari - of course, you don't want to dip the delicate items into such a butter either (had it been served on the side), so it's a tough call to make, and I am glad I didn't have to do so.

We will likely come back and try out some of the full courses, but the smaller plates at least seem to suffer a bit in execution from their description, so it is a good thing that the overall appearance and friendliness of the staff are so strong so as to make up for the shortfalls."}
{"text":"The food as a whole was good quality.  No crusty Italian bread to be found though. They were out of 4 items on the menus at 5:30pm. My wine glass kept catching the table cloth and I discovered that there was a chip on the bottom of the stem. Then I saw a glass fragment on the table and called the waiter over to show him. He apologized and removed the glass and replaced the wine.  A little while later the co-owner came over and showed me a glass that was not chipped on the stem and said she didn't see anything wrong with the glass.  When I told her that was not the glass I gave to the waiter she replied \" I'm sure he wouldn't switch it\". Thus implying that I was mistaken or lying about the glass and chip. That was settled as I wasn't going to continue with such ignorance.  I wasn't looking to make a claim or get anything free, just informing them.  Then they overcharged us for a glass of port.  Although, we shouldn't have we did leave an $18 tip on a $101 check.  First time there and LAST !!"}
{"text":"We put together a group of eight to come have family dinner here during Yelp Restaurant Week. Great company and a delicious meal, nothing better than that!

Allyson D, John H, and myself decided to share a bunch of things. We started with Fagottini Mare e Monte (Stuffed Crepe Purses with Maine Lobster, Summer Squash, Vodka Sauce), their infamous calamari (tossed in a jalapeno honey citrus butter), and the Polpettine di Agnello (Lamb Meatballs, Eggplant Caponata, Shaved Ricotta Salata). All delicious, the star was the calamari. Pro tip: make sure you stir it all up in the bowl so it soaks up the butter sauce. Chef Luca also sent out the antipasto alla Luca (Siano Bufala Mozzarella, Proscuitto di Parma, Cantaloupe, Garlic Crostini, Mixed Marinated Olives, Grilled Market Vegetables) and Caprese Moderna (his take on a fried green tomato). I love the tomato. It's such a unique dish.

For main dishes we ordered: Caposante in Padella (seared scallops, Squid Ink Gnocchi Saut√©e Mushroom and Spinach, Safron, Beurre Blanc), Fettucine con Prosciutto Cotto, Funghi, Piselli e Gorgonzola (Fettucine Pasta, Ham, Mushrooms, Sweet Peas, Gorgonzola), and lasagna. All three were really good. The squid ink gnocchi was fantastic. I think the fettucine may have edged out as my favorite, though.

For dessert, Chef Luca sent out their chocolate pizza, gelato, and semifredo. A perfect ending to such a delicious meal.

Our server Matt was amazing. He handled our table of eight flawlessly. John, the GM, was such a gracious host. I have always been a big fan of his.

Consider this my love letter to say goodbye. Luca Modern Italian Kitchen will close its doors after Easter brunch on Sunday. Chef Luca and Jessica decided to close the restaurant to focus on family, and who can blame them for that? We love you guys and are so excited to see what life has in store for you post-restaurant."}
{"text":"Walking in, the hostess was so welcoming and very fashion forward.  They most definitely set the tone for the restaurant.  The bar area and lighting were BEAUTIFUL!  We had reservations at 6:30pm and were sat immediately.  We were taken to a dark room for our meal.  To our surprise the dining room was almost empty, except for two other tables near us. 

We tried Luca during Yelp Restaurant week and received a 30% discount off of our check. 

Our waiter was nice but seemed very unfocused and somewhat jittery.  He kept checking his notebook and avoided a lot of the specific questions that we asked about the food. 

Regardless, we ordered a bottle of wine and decided to order multiple smaller plates and create our own version of tapas style.  First up, Calamari.  OH MY HEAVENS -- the best I've had in a long time, possibly ever.  I need the recipe.  It is tossed in an orange butter to give it a citrus/honey taste with Jalepenos.  Now, I don't like spicy but this just had the tiniest bit of spice, which was a perfect touch.  They are served with lime wedges.  I think I saw stars with each bite of the delightful Calamari!  I COULD NOT get enough! 

Next up we had the Cassarecce Aglio e Olio and Frutti di Mare.  It had pasta made in-house, crabmeat, shrimp, mussels in garlic and oil.  It was good and plenty for both of us to share but not the best that I've had.  

We also ordered the Burrata, fried mozzarella ball served on tomatoes, served with a couple of pieces of bread.  It was cold when we ate it, since we were focused on the other two plates.  I'm sure it would've been better if we'd eaten it sooner and while warm.  It came out different than what our waiter described - Probably wouldn't order it again.  

We wanted to order Cannolis for dessert but they weren't being served that evening, so we passed on dessert.  

All in all, a beautiful establishment in a neat section of town. Our water and wine glasses stayed full the entire evening.  Service was good.  Thank you Luca and Yelp for your joint efforts during Restaurant Week.  It was a pleasant Friday night. 

The takeaway from my review?! TRY THE CALAMARI!!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and food from start to finish, a beautiful atmosphere, and deliciously creative food! From the creamy burrata and crispy calamari appetizers to the main course of scallops with squid ink gnocchi (Capesante in Padella) and a beautifully stuffed, perfectly cooked tomahawk porkchop (Costata di Maiale). Then Chef Luca presented us with his delectable chocolate ganache dessert topped with peanut butter gelato paired perfectly with a  Lambrusco! 
I really hope to make it back again before we leave for the West Coast and whenever I am back in Charlotte! If you haven't been to Luca's, you haven't tasted authentic and beautiful Italian food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, pretty good atmosphere, good parking. We took advantage of Queens Feast special which was good deal.   Only downside was slow service--not up to this price level. I'd try it again to see if this is systemic problem."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal here last weekend for date night. Our waiter was great and so helpful. All of the dishes are interesting twists on classics and are done so well. We had bison meatballs, wild boar ravioli (our favorite), and the veal, topped off by a chocolate cake and mouse for dessert. The highlight of the night was the Luca's wife, who stopped by every table and spent forever talking with us about food, travel and their restaurant. We can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"The Lady and I planned a double date to Luca during Yelp's Restaurant Week, and it turns out that the entire yelpsophere also came here. It probably would've been easier if we had all walked in and just said \"3 of everything\", but we had to make things difficult ;) 

Chef Luca and his team have owned the building for 14 years; before it was Passion8 (they still have some throwback decor/easter eggs all around) and then to Luca for the past year. I'm struggling to write this review and not use the words \"don't miss out on x\", because the fate of Luca's is unfortunately sealed as of April 1st when they will close after an Easter brunch service. 

From the very beginning, our server Brian and the rest of the team made our night so incredibly enjoyable. We started off with the calamari (fried with honey jalapeno glaze) and Fagottini (stuffed with lobster, veggies, and sauce). Really enjoyed the calamari, my Fagottini was a bit cool but the flavors were spot on! Next up - The Lady and I ordered a burrata bruschetta (that I can't find on the menu...) that was pretty tasty as well! The real winner of the night was the pasta dish, a double order of the rabbit ragu (or as they'd say, \"Maltagliati Pasta Con Coniglio\" but I can't say that). The pasta and sauce were incredible, and the whole thing was seriously a memorable meal. Brian didn't rush us, and we took the whole meal slowly just like they would in Italy, and it was so nice to savor every dish for what it was. A bottle of Chianti Reserva accompanied us for the night that paired excellently! The dim ambiance and conversation over wine made the whole night a meal to remember, and even though this was my first time here, I will miss Luca, and am kicking myself at the missed opportunities I had. Keep em busy till the end, folks. It's a good experience."}
{"text":"After hearing wonderful things about Luca I was looking forward to checking it out during Yelp's Restaurant Week.
We had reservations at 6:45 and were seated immediately. From an initial look I was surprised with the layout of the restaurant and felt it was very dark.
We decided to order a bottle of wine and sample several items on the menu, starting with the Arancini, Calamari and Antipasto.  Of the three starters the Calamari was the stand out. Cooked just right with a hint of lime, perfection. As for the Arancini, I've definitely had better.

After a few starters, we moved on to the pasta and Main dishes. Of those we enjoyed the Bucatini, Rigatoni, Fettuccine and Duck. 
The Fettuccine was my favorite, creamy sauce covered the pasta just right, with a perfect mix of peas and Pancetta! 
Dessert was a let down...don't bother with the Chocolate Pizza. 

Overall I enjoyed dinner, but definitely had more expectations. Knowing they are closing next week maybe service and food is not their priority at this time. 

Note: I was made aware their last day of business is Sunday, April 1, 2018, after Easter Brunch."}
{"text":"Took my chances on Luca after seeing it recommended as one of the top new restaurants in a local Charlotte article.  I was less than impressed.  It wasn't anything spectacular, but also wasn't horrible.  Very much mediocre. 

The atmosphere and decor were on point, and the service was great.  The server was very well versed on the menu, but I felt mislead with regard to portion sizes.  She said pastas located under a certain section of the menu would be 4 ounces and referenced the size of a fist.  This weighed heavily on my decision, yet I was presented with a much larger bowl of a seafood pasta that I won't dare try to name.  

Another member of my party ordered the lasagna, which was also a very large portion.  Upon trying it, it seemed bland.  Very basic.  Pretty much typical lasagna without any flare.  My seafood pasta came over a great butter sauce, but it was broth like.  Being so runny, it didn't cling to the pasta as one would hope.  The noodles were dry for the most part.  Wonderful presentation, but not the most flavorful.  

Our evening began with a shared order of the calamari.  It promised a kick of spice, yet was also surprisingly plain.  Very tender, and not at all chewy as calamari can be, but it lacked the bang that was promised.

The cocktail menu appeared equally underwhelming and offered nothing of appeal to me.  Following the meal, the dessert menu also left me wanting more.  I am happy to say that I gave it a try, but I don't I'll have any reason to go back."}
{"text":"White tablecloth service. Excellent wine list. Fantastic bolognese. Great bar service. Ambience is fine dining so not exactly a cool hangout even at the bar"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful evening and dinner tonight. The restaurant atmosphere was intimate, and warm.  Food was fabulous. The calamari was cooked perfectly and in a delicious sauce, a little bit of spice. The scallops were delicious, shrimp dish, and the ravioli. The only negative thing I would say about this restaurant is that we were still enjoying our evening at 10 PM, and they started  closing down the dining room around us. It was quite disruptive, and we thought inconsiderate. Once we pointed out to the waiter, he apologized, but said his manager told the staff they could move forward with closing the dining room down. I would have rated this restaurant a 5 star based on the food, however, the late evening experience, and only at 10 PM, put a damper on the end of our dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian food in Charlotte hands down! You will not be disappointed! Excellent service and the food was AMAZING! Highly recommend!"}
