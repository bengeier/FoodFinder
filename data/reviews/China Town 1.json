{"text":"Google ratings are numerous and complimentary so I decided to try it out. Fresh food cooked as you wait. Not really authentic Chinese food but I have a very high threshold as I come from Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley, home of Chinese food. This place had a continuous string of people. Neighborhood a bit sketchy. I like that this is a mom and pop establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered general tso chicken. Was there within 5 minutes to pick it up and it was already boxed bagged and ready to go.how is that even possible? The chicken was not crispy at all. It was very soggy with some liquid in the container. very disappointing meal.Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant. I been coming to this location for over 20 years! Hands down the best and never have to wait long!!"}
{"text":"We originally called China Town II, they close earlier than China Town I so they redirected our order because of how late it was.  We had a very large order, ($41.05) and they had everything made PERFECTLY. It was great in taste as well. Large portions as well, we will definitely be back!"}
