{"text":"Everyone was super friendly. they had a good selection of snacks and drinks. It was close to the room which made it super convenient.  I liked it. nice perk."}
{"text":"Outstanding service from the lovely people in the lounge. They are cheerful and welcoming. It doesn't feel stuffy or stiff like some concierge levels or comparable lounges. It's a bit of a hike from the lobby but it's healthy to walk... the food and selections are delicious, well defined (ie: gluten free, vegetarian etc) something for everyone. 
The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed, just renovated in Nov 2017. The grounds are kept impeccable and stunning.

It was very relaxing and pampering. 

Thank you Fairmont!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffet selection, with a different egg option and separate meat option each day. It may sound strange, but the bread was awesome - super fresh and delicious after toasting, with the variety of spread options they had available.

The staff are very friendly and attentive. Fantastic arrangement, so a bunch of groups can be eating/lounging at the same time. There is a sun porch, main seating area, living room-like area, and seating neat the buffet. Overall, the lounge is extremely clean, well manicured, and has fresh flowers switched out weekly (we ran into the florist one afternoon)."}
{"text":"Great lounge for lite breakfast and after pool refreshments. Great for the kids to kickback and literally chill out. People that work in the lounge are great especially Shani, Marty and Clara."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant. It's a free perk for top tier guests.

A restaurant is somewhere that you go to and pay for food. 

This is an amenity for VIP guests only. Fairmont Gold is available exclusively for guests staying in the 69  Fairmont Princess Gold rooms.

Has no business even being included in RESTAURANTS on Yelp."}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to be a Gold Guest at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, you will have access to the Gold Lounge.  Breakfast was amazing!  A changing hot menu daily with great staples like smoked salmon and the fixings for Bagel and Lox, meats, cut fruit and berries, Muesli, cereals and such.  The highlight for me and my husband was the oatmeal creme brule.  
Additionally, the staff was friendly, warm, welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, helpful and a joy to be around.  Couldn't ask for better pampering than having the Lounge available with its staff to make our stay amazing!"}
{"text":"Not a restaurant but a lounge for VIP guests who are checked in on one of Fairmont Gold's 69 guest rooms. We originally planned on staying for only 3 days and 2 nights but decided to extend for another day as we were enjoying ourselves too
much! The service here is remarkable! From the moment that we arrived, we were escorted straight from the main lobby down to the Fairmont Gold Lounge to check in, in there we were welcomed by their wonderful staff. Our whole stay was very relaxing as we never encountered any hassle thanks to their amazing service! they really go above and beyond to make sure any of our requests were fulfilled! We haven't even left the resort yet but we already made plans on coming back in a month!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm probably more-than-experienced with everything the Gold Lounge has to offer guests. After spending over 100 nights at the Princess Gold lounge during 30 visits over the past 4 years...it feels like coming home, only better.

Service level is remarkable facilitating many of my business / social meetings. Staff couldn't be more warm and engaging. Breakfast food is fresh and nicely presented with appealing apps in the eve and a well stocked cocktail bar.

The staff, once again, make this place remarkable.
