{"text":"Have just returned home from eating there tonight. The food was fairly tasty and it was a pleasant enough night, until when we were waiting for our bill my girlfriend spotted what can only be described as the biggest rat either of us have seen bound out of the kitchen. This monster proceeded to skip through the restaurant and scurried down to the toilets. We informed the waiter who after having a quick look told us ' It's downtown, it happens.' As someone who has lived downtown for several years and in the same neighbourhood I found this both alarmingly accepting and dismissive. We have never seen a rat this big and this is not an attempt at hyperbole.

They did comp us our bill because my girlfriend felt sick but the way the way the waiter accepted the unwanted guest was shocking.

Found out afterwards that they have recently been taken over by a people who are not Italian so ignore the quaint story in the menu about Italian ownership.

Avoid."}
{"text":"The pheasant risotto is to die for! The menu selection was limited, however both the pasta and the risotto that we ordered were off the hook!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant after doing a general search and seeing previous ratings weren't too bad.  We had an awesome time -- food was really good, and service was attentive.  As it was a Sunday night, it was not as busy as I'm sure it is other times, however our large party of 9 people were dealt with very well.  We even got a word in with the chef, who was obviously out to please the restaurant's diners.
Highly recommend this restaurant to others visiting Toronto like us, as well as locals.
Liked this place enough that we went back to the hotel and told the concierge to put this place on his list of recommendations."}
{"text":"I had came here for dinner with three others, I had the chicken caticcitore which wasn't bad, I mean it wasn't spectacular either.The service however was terrible our waiter came to the table a total of  three times at one point we had our empty dishes sitting there for over 10 mins before our table was cleared. The food was bland and lacked seasoning I don't recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"Weirdly for a place with pizza in its name, pizza was not available when we went. Risotto was nice but didn't seem award winning to me, as they proudly mention. Salami appetizer with pistachios and honey was the highlight."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant!   Serves rustic, comfort food.  Have been here several times and have tried different dishes and our favs are:

-Award winning pheasant risotto
-Hand-made pastas \"strangle the priest\"
-their own in house made cured meats.  So good!

Came here a few times with those deal find/teambuy/groupon type deals....but we were going here before they offered the deals...so if you find the promos, they are great value!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while still serving up some good food based on reviews, I decided to check it out with my gf. We got two apps, two mains, two desserts for a set price. The place is fine dine with filtered water for each table, and olive oil and balsamic vinagrette with the pita bread and focachia.

Our apps were the carpacchio and the cured meats. We selected three kinds. One was wild boar, one was more fatty type, and the other was more salty taste like. Our favourite was the fatty one.

The carpacchio was alright, but we definitely had better else where.
The size portion here are definitely good since they're Italian.

Entree's we got the Osso Buco with risotto on the bottom. Now Osso Buco is usually tender, but this I found to be quite tough and also its more bone and cartilage ratio compared to meat. Priced at $31, next time this will not be on my radar.

My gf got the Branzino two fillets with garlic butter and grilled veggies. Her meal is better than mine for sure.

Desserts: I got the molten warm chocolate lava cake. Yes, there was oozie chocolate and its warm, so it was a good dessert compared to the Panna Cotta, my gf got which is like eating yogurt pudding.

Overall, the service was attentive and caring, and we did not feel rush. It wasn't busy at the time, but nevertheless, this is a place we are willing to try in the future for their pastas and such."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been to Romagna Mia, now Paganelli's. The food is simple and done to perfection, the octapus with the celery root puree was amazing and a great way to start a meal. I had the potatoe crusted cod which was cooked to perfection and the black olive tapenade was a perfect companion for the fish. My wife started with the capicolla and had the risotto made tableside for her main. She enjoyed hers and several bites of mine. Alex (the chef) made rounds in the dining room making sure that all was ok, it is nice to see. The evening was a great success and we will be back. When i am in Toronto even if it is not to eat i will be stopping by to pick up some \"salumi\" it is all great.
Thanks for a wonderful night.

{"text":"Permanently closed.

Stopped by there last night and the place has signs on the doors that the premises have been reposed by the landlord."}
{"text":"People please save your money, there are dozens of better restaurants in the area.  Fiance and I shared ceaser salad $10 which tasted off.  I had mushroom risotto $27 and fiance had gorgonzola risotto $23.  It was bland and very pedestrian. Gorgonzola risotto was very average also she ate less than half.  Waiter offered to change my order. I got the gnocchi in tomato sauce.  Gnocchi was way overcooked and sauce tasted like ragu from super market.  I also only ate 2 bites of that.  They still charged me for the way more expensive risotto even though I ate neither dish. I don't normally write bad reviews but this place is just a waste of time and money.  $27 or $23 for a risotto is really pricey and would understand if it was out of this world but these were not even close. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"3/5! Not the best Italian in the city. The food was average. I recommend the steak or risotto."}
{"text":"This is what I had to start: Fagioli all'Uccelletto (Stewed cannellini beans with tomato sauce and sage). You must have this when you go! It's served with some sort of flat bread, it looked like something I would serve the kids, but don't let the simplicity of presentation fool you, this starter is divine.

This is what I had in-between: Pizze Pomodoro - Parma. It's the first time I used a pair of scissors to cut my pizza into slices, besides that the thin crust pizza was to my liking.

This is what I had to finish: Panna Cotta con Fichi e Mandorle al Caramello (A light, silky custard served with caramelized figs and almonds). I am a big Panna Cotta fan hence my choice. The figs were an interesting twist to this desert.

The place was packed, the food and service was good, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is good, however I think the portions are a little small, especially for the price.  That being said, the food is absolutely delicious though.  My only complaint is the wait staff doesn't seem to be overly welcoming."}
{"text":"It's hard to review since we never even made it to the table.
Upon entering the restaurant, we looked around and the place was dead. Mind you this was 8:00 on a Saturday night.
We saw the bartender staring into space- he did not acknowledge us until I approached and asked for a table of two. 
He hmmed and hawwed and came behind the bar to tell me and my partner to sit at the bar. I politely refused because- the dining room was EMPTY- surely it wouldn't take long to sit us.
His attitude was in a word: creepy.
He then left without a word to tend to a table and didn't come back. Service staff walked past us without a smile or acknowledgement. We left within seven minutes of waiting around and standing like idiots. We found another lovely restaurant soon after!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Toronto for. 4-day weekend and this place caught our eye near where we were staying. My pesto risotto with shrimp was amazing, as was my husband's braciola and salmon dishes. Attentive service but not too much, delicious wine and very nice and unusual bread. We thought it was great!"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant with my wife for dinner. all in all we were ex trimly pleased. food was very tasty (although we only tried couple of the pizzas but we did glanced at other tables and everything seem very tasty and beautiful)
service was great, very professional.
only minor comment, we felt that the wine list had only imported italian bottles and were all very highly priced! bottles at $500-600 should not even be on menu, imo...this is not las vegas! would be great if they offered some local ontario wine as well or at the very least \"house wine\" selection\" at more affordable rates. even a beet bottle at $7 is a stretch when the next door has happy hour special $4 bottles. 

all in all - totally worth a visit to this authentic italian restaurant! we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Went with group of 8 for a bday. 6/8 disliked their food. ie:
18$ Gnocchi was overbooked and cheap taste 
17$ Tomatoes and mozzarella salad was literally half a tomato with 4 pieces of mozzarella 
29$ Prize winning risotto was meh according to my friend

Service was ok. FYI if you have a Yelp coupon they will argue you it would work the day of...even when not stated in their terms and conditions. 

Would definitely not return. Go somewhere with better food for the prices."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Italian meal from Emilia Romagna region (gastronomic capital of Italy), Paganelli's is your answer!

My frd took us there 2 Sat ago, the restaurant was packed.  They estimated a wait time of 45 min.  As it was highly recommended by my frd (apparently all the pasta were made in house), we decided to  stay put.  Though I have to say, the waiter wasn't the nicest....

Among the 4 of us, we ordered a LOT of food:

Started with Pizze: Salsiccia e Pancetta (pizza was quite well done in my opinion.  It's comparable to Libretto's and Terroni's, it's slightly different style, the crust is a bit thicker compare to the Neapolitan pizza.  We, also, ordered Gran Fritto dell Adriatico con Verdure Crocanti.  It's a great appetizer to share, can't really go wrong with deep fried dish.... 

For mains:
Spaghetti Carbonara - It definitely reminded me of the carbonara's I have had in italy, nicely done.  
Maltagliati del Pescatore (with the house made black squid ink noodles instead) - I love squid ink pasta, and it's VERY difficult to find it, let alone good squid ink pasta!!!  
Risotto con Fagiano e Tartufo - this is the winner of the golden spoon-best risotto in Canada 2001- it was sooooo good, if you love truffle and cheese, this is for you!

For dessert:
Mimosa al Limone e Frutti di Bosco - this was a nice surprised, it was light and just what we need after a heavy meal  
Tiramisu - I was slightly disappointed with the tiramisu, too much whipped cream on top for my taste, it's still tasty, but I expected more from such authentic restaurant.

Overall, I enjoyed the food here and would definitely come back to try other stuff on the menu.  I have to say, the food here is relatively strong in flavor.  This is not a place for a light dinner for sure....unless you are onl gonna have a salad."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  There were four of us dining appetizers entrees and 3 beer were about $105 
Although the portions were not huge they were a satisfying size.  
There were only 3 vegetarian options none of which were pizza.  All in all a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Really loved the risotto and the strangle-the-bishop pasta. Found the service good. In the past I've been disappointed with some dishes... chose the popular ones and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Just back from dinner at Paganelli's tonight with a group of colleagues. It was outstanding and authentic, fantastic Italian food at really quite reasonable prices. Some might take off points  for timeliness of service, which was perhaps a bit slow but more likely just an intentional allowance for quality time and conversation during our dinner and proper time to prepare the food. Regardless, it was worth the wait. I've been to Italy twice, and this is the only Italian restaurant I've been to in North America that delivers a similar experience to typical dining in Italy. Cured meats platter, cheese and olives were very typical of Italy, and delicious. One of the traditional dishes in Tuscany and north is Rustichelle al Cinghiale - or wild boar ragu over pasta. They had it on the menu at Paganelli's, and I asked the waiter about it - he recommended it and added that they (restaurant owners) raise the boar themselves to supply the restaurant. Now wild boar may sound odd, but having had the dish in Italy and loved it, I was up for trying it here. All I can say is, you have to try it. Homemade pappardelle pasta - excellent texture and taste - with an incredibly flavorful ragu. Small bits of meat, tomatoes. Perfect. Be sure to have it with a nice northern Italian wine. Wish they would open Paganelli's II in Philadelphia. I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon. It used to be better, but they're still good. Likely, our last trip here, although I wouldn't complain if friends/family wanted to try this place out.

Squid/shrimp appetizer: A very generous portion size here. It was good, not great.

Strozzapretti: The highlight of our dinner. Very delicious.

Squid ink lobster pasta: Disappointing. The noodles were thick, and the lobster & sauce didn't have much flavor. It was ok, but not worth the premium at all."}
{"text":"Romagna Mia is one of my favourite Italian restos in Toronto.  So much so, I celebrated my big 3-0 there.  (crap - there i go showing my age again...)

Their homemade pasta is the draw here.  It is definitely not for anyone following a low carb diet.

I admit: I'm a creature of habit.  When I find something I love, I stick to it and I walk away with a happy tummy.  They used to have something called 'strobaferba' (i'm sure i slaughtered the spelling) a seafood pasta dish - HEAVEN.  It's been replaced by Maltagliati del Pescatore ($18) which is a very worthy replacement.  The Pasta e Fagioli (with shrimp and calamari - $9) is also fantastic.

Top it off with the AMAZING Panna Cotta with candied figs ($8) and it's my idea of a perfect Italian meal.  

The look and feel of the space is a bit old-school... definitely not one of the trendier restaurants in the city.  But if you're looking for comforting pasta and some good old-fashioned carbs, Romagna Mia is a good place to turn."}
{"text":"Romagna Mia is famous for risotto, so I order seafood and an arugula salad.
ooooh rebel without a cause! 
nah, three of my dining companions ordered risotto, one ordered lamb, and we each did a fork-full sampling of the meals. the menu's origins are from italy's emilia-romagna region.

personally, i really enjoyed the seafood and i'm glad i passed on the risotto. perhaps because it was a slow night (during the toronto freeze warning) and the stocks used to make the risotto was just too concentrated... to the point of being too salty.

the service was awesome! friendly, knowledgeable, and patient (some of us *cough* were an hour late for our reservation)."}
{"text":"I visited Paganelli's as part of a group and I although I went in with bit of trepidation based on the mixed reviews I read here, I think Paganelli's has some high points to be sure, but I was disappointed with the experience overall. 

The highs: atmosphere is nice, staff are friendly (enough), wine was good. 

The lows: The menu online dosent match the menu in the restaurant. That's okay, I guess, because the chef might change things, but it stinks to have carefully planned ahead on what you only to realize you can't have what you wanted to have. Since I have a fair number of food sensitivities (gluten, dairy) this place wasn't a great pick to start with (someone else decided on the venue) but I was hoping that the staff would be able to accomodate me - and most times this works out really well. 

What is most disappointing about Paganelli's is that as a solution to my dietary requirements, I asked the waiter for a salad with chicken, no cheese please. What I received was a dismal and disappointing plate that had less than fresh greens and a sparse spattering of chicken - not enough to count as even a small chicken breast. No dressing was offered, so the entire thing was bland, bland, bland. 

In fairness, some of the other dishes looked very nice and I think the food would be a 3 out of 5 for those who ate a regular entree that night. I probably wont return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner tonight, had the scallop risotto and the 7 oz NY strip loin. Scallops were cooked perfectly and the steak was cooked to medium rare as requested. Only thing was portions were a little small."}
{"text":"Cons:
* soup was salty
* lasagna had ground meat that tasted packaged instead of hand made
* staff was inattentive, had to ask for water twice. 
* appetizer bread was extremely oily
* food was EXTREMELY hot, like it had been microwaved.

Pros: 
* nice ambiance
* great neighborhood to people watch in Toronto"}
{"text":"The food is tasteless. I had to return my dish twice, however the service was good.
I believe is overpriced for what they offer.

I would never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but a tad too salty. Pork neck tender but super salty. Pastas were good according to my friends. Not too salty. Slightly expensive"}
{"text":"****3.5 Stars****

The only reason Paganelli's (Romagna Mia) gets 3.5 stars is that the interior of the place could use a facelift in my opinion, very traditional Italian atmosphere.  

The place has been at the corner of Front and George (in heart of St. Lawrence) for 15 years, so it's a little dated for me but not offensive, but hey - the price is reasonable and the quality is top notch and I can walk there.  

This place is on my regular rotation (more than twice a year).

Service has always been decent and met my expectations - they also know how to serve wine, which is always a tell tale sign of either a professional wait staff or a professional waiter.

As for food, AMAZING PIZZA, a great wine selection (especially Italian selections) and risotto prepared at your table in a parmesan cheese wheel - nuff said.

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just a wonderful experience with great food and incredible service. I cannot recommend this place highly enough for those who live on Toronto or are just visiting."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. We had a groupon so didn't end up paying full price. But still wasn't happy. The food is over priced. small portions and nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is a big time favourite of mine.
The food is rustic and incredibly fresh and delicious.
I will never forget my first visit when my boss took a few of us there after a busy year end.
The pasta's are fresh, the risotto is killer, the staff is always warm and they know what's going on in the kitchen.  They even cure their own meats.

I highly recommend it and to be honest I'm due a visit very soon.

Try it you won't be disappointed.  They have a lovely selection of wine and grappa"}
{"text":"Wow this was disappointing. after reading prior reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was going to a show at Kool Haus and wanted to have a nice dinner beforehand. Maybe this place would be good for families, but as a date it was subpar for sure. The meal started off well with a nice beef carpaccio but quickly went downhill from there. Other than when we ordered our food, the waiter only came by to deliver the cheque. My glass of water was empty for the entire meal, which might have been acceptable had the food not been insanely salty... I ordered the \"award-winning\" Risotto set in a pheasant ragout with black truffle pate and could not even finish it. My date's carbonara pasta was just as salty. I'm normally a person who can handle high levels of salt but this was truly unreasonable. In addition the ambiance is far from romantic and the food is not cheap. Maybe had I ordered other dishes my experience would have been better, but I'll never find out though - there's plenty of other Italian places in Toronto."}
{"text":"A Yelp review is often written after eating at a restaurant only once. I dined at Paganelli's four times over the last three weeks. I ordered the same items each time, and every time all three were flawless. 

I recommend:

- The carpaccio 
- The pappardelle 
- The strozzapreti alla romagnola"}
{"text":"Wow. Outstanding food, outstanding service. We had an excellent dinner at this charming Italian restaurant! The ambiance is perhaps the only thing lacking, but it can be excused for the incredible Strozzapreti (strangle the priest). Also their quail risotto is out of this world. Definite must taste!"}
{"text":"Being a northern Italian I was delighted to find a place that wasn't cranking out the same Italian food. Amazing service amazing food. You have to try their prosciutto best i have ever had"}
{"text":"I used my GroupOn on Saturday April 7, 2012 (2 Apps, 2 Mains and a dessert)

Everything I ate had this crunchy salt particle taste to it. The food here are extremely salty. The only good thing was the lamb, if you don't dip it in the sauce. And I'm really a sauce guy.

Besides the food, the waiters were sort of weird. My girlfriend was looking through the drinks menu while the waiter took our order. He did not ask if we wanted drinks and we had to flag another waiter down. 

Best part of the night was Dessert. I chose the chocolate lava cake because it was the sweetest thing on the menu. After you ate a couple blocks of salt, trust me you're gonna need this. 

I don't recommend this restaurant because it's WAY too salty. Or perhaps that's the treatment you get for using GroupOn with this resto."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience.  Excellent service from our friendly waitress, plus some of the best risotto I've ever had, and some excellent linguini with mushrooms.  A very fair value for the money.  As others have said, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I actually visited this place a while ago on a friend's recommendation and really liked it when it was still called Romagna Mia. So I wanted to check it out when I heard it had undergone a renovation and name change, but still had the same owners.

I came on a Saturday night and there were 4 of us. I called at 6:30pm for a table at 7:30pm and they were able to accommodate us easily. What we had:

- Caesar Salad
- Soup of the day, which was broccoli and potato
- \"Strangle the Priest\" pasta
- Spaghetti Carbonara
- Risotto con Fagiano e Tartufo

As usual, everything was very solid italian food. It's not fancy (like Buca or any of those trendy King St W restos), but it was good italian food and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was good, portion sizes were fair and decor was comfortable rustic italian style.

For some reason I remembered the food being a bit better. While it was good, it wasn't amazing in any sense.

So good choice for italian food if you're in the area, but not necessarily worth the travel there."}
{"text":"Good homemade pasta. I had it for brunch and it was very flavorful without being heavy. I can't wait to come back for dinner. Good service. The panini are small but tasty and come w salad."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here after looking for somewhere warm to eat after going to the Christmas market. It's a hidden gem. We were a bit uneasy at first because of the price but once we tried the food it's easy to see how the restaurant is worth the money. The dishes are authentically Italian. We all got pastas and loved them. The desert was also divine and the staff were friendly. Only drawback was the price but for the quality I guess I can understand!"}
{"text":"First off, I am usually not overly impressed by Italian restaurants unless they are really good and do everything right because I can whip up a pasta dish fairly easily at home. In the end, Paganelli's is okay. 

The really good Italian restaurants I have experienced have plenty of fresh bread on the table, and they keep it coming. And they have really good olive oil for dipping. At Paganelli's we got one basket of bread, which I appreciated because I was starving, but the bread was a little salty, and there was nothing to dip it in, and it didn't keep coming either.

The other thing that didn't sit well with me was that they don't have beers on tap (which is probably why they don't advertise any on their website). Although I'm sure their wine selection is much better, and that does make sense for an Italian restaurant, but I'm a beer guy... Most of the beers are Italian, although they do have bottles of Keith's. 

The third thing that I wasn't high on was that the food is a little on the salty side, like a lot of the other reviews mentioned. It has a bit of the salt = flavour thing going on for sure, which confuses me a bit because I thought Italian food was mostly about fresh ingredients and letting those sing. 

The other thing that I find strange, but isn't a big deal is that you have to cut your own pizza which scissors... which I think would be a fun activity for kids to do, and would keep them busy. But why? Give me a pizza cutter and I'll cut my own pizza thanks.

I really wanted to like this place. I didn't mind the decor, the service, the variety of food... They just miss on a lot of little things that could really elevate the experience."}
{"text":"The food here is simply delicious!! The dishes are straightforward while the flavours are bold and homey.  I withheld one star for the dated decor and the fact that my experience is based on two of their most recommended dishes.  

Our party of two ordered their award-winning risotto with pheasant and truffle pate as well as the squid ink pasta with lobster.  The pasta was dressed in tomato and zucchini; it was hearty and refreshing at the same time.  I was very impressed by the chunks of lobster which were fresh and juicy.  The risotto was the best I've ever had and just out of this world.  I am by no means a risotto connoisseur but it was perfectly cooked (al dente without a crunchy centre) and the flavour was rich and satisfying.  At felt I was concerned that it may be gamey from the pheasant but it was not at all; it did have that comforting, delicate, savoury poultry flavour.  Even my boyfriend, who usually frowns upon risottos, said that it was really good.  We were in carb heaven!  I can totally see myself craving for the risotto in the future.

I enjoyed these two dishes so much that I would definitely order them again when I come back next time.  However, I really want to try other menu items as well; the pizza on the next table looked quite pretty.  Ahh...the dilemma."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been in Toronto to so far. The Tagliere di Salumi Misti (appetizer for 2, with prosciutto, salami, pancetta) was divine! I had the Risotto ai Funghi Misti e Tartufo which was also pretty good, and the Tiramissu... OMG!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decor may have been popular in the 80s. Its time for an update. Yes I'll give them dabs for making their own pasta, but when the server put the freshly ground pepper on it. Thats all you can taste. We had to ask for more sauce to balance out the flavour. But in all honesty, in the menu they brag about (the best pasta in toronto) but its just average food priced unreasonably high.

If its a restaurant on front street they should utilize what they have and focus on a smaller menu that is executed with a hell of a lot more finesse. especially if the rent+utilities is at least $13,000."}
{"text":"Paganelli's = great food, terrible service! 

I find myself visiting this area of the city more and more for dinner, so no surprise that I've stumbled into Paganelli's. 

Paganelli's is an Italian spot specializing in pizzas, with a great location and spacious(ish) patio. 

While the pizza is excellent (i've tried two varieties now, and both have been great!) the Cesar salad I had was mediocre, but apparently the soup is delicious. The only real issue I have with this spot is the terrible service! 

When we arrived we asked if we could be seated on the patio - no one was on it, but it was a beautiful night so we decided to be the trend setters. After taking some time to get out and take our orders, we asked the (very gloomy) server why no one else was on the patio, and he said because \"we don't like  to sit anyone on the patio\" in a weird and almost attempting us to feel guilty way... what?? I guess if you're short staffed it could make some sense, but maybe think of a better way of saying it to your paying guests! 

The service is generally slow and gloomy. Even our first impression (calling to check if they were open), when we asked they responded \"Yes, WHY?\".... because we want to eat there!

Overall this place is worth a visit if you're hoping for pizza and in the area, as long as you can tolerate the service!"}
{"text":"I'm still going all out with my stars. I go often these days, and this has become my favourite place for Italian. Service is fantastic consistently.

I bought a coupon the other day, and still received top notch service from Matthew and fabulous food.

Not to be missed - their 'strangle the priest' pasta and rissottos. The panna cotta is one of the lightest and best I've had."}
{"text":"What a great find! I stumbled upon the gem of a restaurant featuring the cuisine of one of my favorite regions in Italy - Emilia Romagna. What's more is that they had been voted to have the best risotto back in 2001. Any claim like that is one that I really must try...

Risotto con Fagiano e Tartufo is a generous portion of rich risotto with small bits of pheasant complete with shavings of black truffles on top. I thought I would eat the entire dish...the risotto was so divinely rich I could sadly only eat half, but I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience some divine risotto! I was equally impressed with the antipasti including a few varieties of meats and some sharp pecorino cheese.

This restaurant looks like one you'd actually find in Italy too...not some made up story-book version of what you think you'd like to find, but what you do actually find. One that is modern and comfortable without too many bells and whistles. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular. There is patio dining as well."}
{"text":"I was just there over the long wknd !! It's a nice authentic italian eatery! The atmosphere is polished but not snooty with a great spacious patio....the menu has all the great italian classics and new things too!  Once you've ordered,... the food comes out fast!  The portions are good and plentiful... a tad bit on the greasy side! 

The only thing I would suggest is that the waiters/waitresses don't put too much pressure on the clientele to order! I felt a bit rushed."}
{"text":"Delicious! Top notch risotto. Good pasta. Nice environment. Easily among the best Italian restaurants in Toronto.

We had:
Penne all'arrabbiata - the chef can do simple things well! Very nice tomato sauce. Pasta perfectly al dente.
Risotto con Fagiano e Tartufo - pheasant ragout, truffle pate. Brilliant savory flavor explosion.
$32 excluding wine, tax, and tip."}
{"text":"I use to go to Paganelli's about a year and a half ago and I loved it. I was amazed at how good everything was from appetizer to main course to dessert and coffee. I live very close to them and was very thrilled that this restaurant was so close. However, over time I feel a lot has changed but not nessessary for the better. I was telling a friend how great this place was and brought him with me one evening as he wanted to try it out from all my bragging about the place. U was quite embarrassed because his pizza was soggy and flimsy and very very salty. The same pizza I use to always get. We also shared a pasta dish that I also always use to get (strangle the priest pasta) and it was also very salty and the pasta was over cooked. Lastly, We both ordered the tira misu (always use to get it) and it was literally 3 table spoons worth for $11.00. He even commented that this was so tiny for $11. Last year it was double the size. It's just disappointing that a place that use to be so good is a place I won't go to anymore because the quality of food has really dropped and also the service. I'd recommend trying a place a few blocks over called Terroni. Really really good."}
{"text":"Meh. My date and I strolled in famished on Saturday night. Pasta was a reasonable choice -- we both had marathons to run the next morning -- and I was excited to see what Romagna had to offer. The space is interesting: lots of exposed brick, ample seating, a cool bar and probably the worst terra cotta floor tile I've ever seen. You can't win 'em all.

One major negatory: we were seated by a table within arm's reach of the kitchen (I was even tempted to lean over and do some prep). This particularly stung considering the many alternative free tables -- including an empty four-top adjacent to us -- any of which would have been infinitely better.

I am mixed about the food. I ordered the \"Spaghetti alla Carbonara - Vera!\" meaning no sauce, onions, or garlic. I liked the concept. The dish was well-made and the pasta was fresh, but I must say QUITE SALTY. Ditto my date's Strozzapreti alla Romagnola (\"Strangle the Priest\" pasta). The sausage ragout was good, but everything had 1000% of my daily intake of sodium. I felt like I was going to induce hypertension just sitting there.

Obligatory Title Pun: More like, Romagna Mia IMPOSTERIA.

Menu Readability: Quite lovely actually.

Need to mention: There are cured meats in a fridge by the door.

What this place teaches me about myself: I may be a salty character, but that doesn't mean my pasta has to be."}
{"text":"I love Italian food, love risotto, love homemade pasta, and therefore I love this restaurant.  

My husband likes the lasagna which is made with a white sauce. 

The place has a warm atmosphere and I vaguely recall someone playing an accordian.  Just call ahead to make sure they are open because I've shown up a few times to find that they aren't open during certain hours and certain days."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best food I ever had. But when your hungry and you've been walking around you'll practically eat anything. Try the vegetarian options it's pretty good  but don't come here thinking it's top of the line or anything."}
