{"text":"Cargo coffee is one of my favorite places to get some weekend work done. Not only do they have plenty of seating, coffee, tea, and food options, but they sometimes have live music. There is plenty of nearby street parking and a small parking garage next door. Additionally, if you prefer something quick, the E Wash location has a great drive through!"}
{"text":"Love this shop! I have only gone through the drive through but the inside looks very spacious so I am sure it is a good spot for homework or meetings. Staff is mostly top notch and my drinks are always made exactly how I like them. Great breakfast sandwiches. Would be 5 stars but I had one really really unfortunate experience with a messed up order and an extremely rude employee (supervisor of some sort I think) recently that has me feeling like they need to earn my loyalty back a bit. I am pretty sure it is just one bad apple that would benefit from some customer service training. ;)"}
{"text":"Good coffee, thoughtful and nice baristas, and good food. The design of the shop, too, if you're any kind of design nerd, is pretty thoughtful."}
{"text":"I reguarly have work meeting at Cargo and I have to say it is such a great place to grab a cup of joe!   The staff is great and willing to accommodate my distaste for dairy.  They have almond milk as an option for every beverage and I am always amazed when barristas can make a frothy cappuccino wih almond milk.   There is always a place to sit because the space is quite large and even features a little upstairs area.    They have great sandwiches and wraps.  If you're not into their signature sandwiches, you can always build your own from a list of ingredients that they provide for you."}
{"text":"For me this is a story of highs and lows. It's an excellent, bright, airy space with lots of tables and outlets, and highly reasonable coffee prices. It's really an almost perfect coffee shop.  Except...  The food. Really unimaginative, limited sandwich offerings, and not vegetarian-friendly, which is weird for Madison. They have a PB&J, a really so-so veggie wrap, and sometimes there's veggie soup. If you're vegetarian, that's it. And more than once I've been here when they \"forgot to make the soup today,\" or only had meat options. How hard would it be to offer some grilled cheese, breakfast sandwiches, or salad options?  I love this place, but I hate coming here knowing I probably can't get a meal."}
{"text":"If I am ever given a 'Last Meal\", it will include a vegan oatmeal cream pie from Cargo Coffee.  If you've never tried one, you seriously. SERIOUSLY. should.  (Also, great lattes and atmosphere and such. But it's all about the omg oatmeal cream pies.)"}
{"text":"Pretty space, good coffee, convenient location. Nice to have a drive-through in this part of town esp w/ fair-trade coffee.  I came here to study though and even with music and a white noise generator playing (simultaneously) through my headphones, it was really gd loud! Conversation and their too-loud music is amplified off the concrete floors, walls and ceilings. Noise level is more like a bar than a coffee shop."}
{"text":"I love Cargo! I had my hesitations to patron it at first, but after finding out Lindsey from Ground Zero owned it, I gave in. It is now exclusively where I pick up coffee for my boss and staff. Every single employee makes my day--every time. Super charming, always bubbly and helpful. 5 stars for service alone! Love love love!"}
{"text":"Great Baristas. They are always willing to offer a suggestion or something interesting to try. Try the spicy chai today and it was delicious. Very cool space right off of East Wash. Plenty of seating and places to study or just relax with friends."}
{"text":"No pretention, no frills.  This is just the best espresso in town with really friendly baristas and great bakery/lunch items.  Live music, multi-level seating, big space.  Designed with your laptop needs in mind.  Free parking and drive up window.  You will love Cargo!"}
{"text":"Cargo Coffee in the Constellation is as good as a coffee shop gets. Let's talk atmosphere: trendy, bright, inviting. Need to lounge and get your study on? They gots comfy sofas and chairs. Need a casual meeting place for business? Plenty of side tables and corner nooks. Looking for a chance to reign over the minions of the Earth? Head upstairs for an Eagle's nest experience. How bouts the coffee, delish! They offer a variety of Fair Trade brews and you can get it fresh ground in a French Press! Um, hello, what are you doing with your life if you're not here.  Special shout out to the baristas who are always smiling and social and will deliver said French Press to your table so you don't have to awkwardly wait in line with strangers stares wondering if you are in love with the cinnamon rolls. Last but not least,we all know downtown parking is a pain but you can always scoop a spot in the parking garage here, for FREEEEEE.  Come here but don't take my spot, mmkay???"}
{"text":"I have been to Cargo Coffee a total of three times. Twice was off of East Washington and once off Park Street. The Cargo off East Wash is a terrific space all glass and steel. They have free water that you don't have to ask for which is nice. The baristas were friendly and their coffee is very good, not the bitter, burnt tasting gack you get from Starbucks or other joints. I had a positive experience at the East Wash location they have a nice seating area with couches and soft chairs as well as hard top tables on the lower level and then they have a more intimate area upstairs with a long table against a wall in the back where you can plug in laptops and electronic devices and sit and work in peace and quiet. Why only three stars? My gripes are these: *My experience at the Park Street location was completely different. The place closes really early for a coffee house while East Wash location stays open appropriately late. The staff at the East Wash location were friendly and helpful while the Park Street they seemed not super happy to be there also the park street location is small and dirty inside. The mugs were even dusty and dirty. I was there about 45 minutes before it closed thinking it would be open later like the Wash location and felt like they were trying to chase me out by cleaning up around me. *I really think their merchandise is cool and wanted to send a friend a Tee shirt but they only had smalls. They didn't offer a timeframe when more would be in stock and you cannot order merchandise online. also they did not offer to help me get the tee shirt in a larger size. *As noted above ALL locations should be consistent when selling a brand. *If the issues above were/are resolved I would elevate Cargo coffee to a solid 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Cargo is a cool little cafe with plenty of space for working and a cool theme. Still, their coffee is just so/so, and there are better places in town for sure if you are just looking for a drink. Here's my thoughts:  1) The space is probably the best part of Cargo Coffee. They have tons and tons of tables (I can't see it ever filling up!), a pleasant atmosphere, and while they could have more power outlets, you can usually find one. The map ont he wall is particularly unique and cool.   2) The coffee is just so/so. Despite having a sign that says \"we will make any drink,\" and despite having V60s, they said they couldn't make me a pour-over. The regular coffee tastes like it had been sitting around a long time (it actually had, \"9:30\" was written on the machine and it was after 11:30 when I arrived).   3) Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly enough (even with not wanting to make the drink I wanted), and they have a ton of food too."}
{"text":"Finally tried the cafe in my building!! I like it better than ground zero because of the space! It's huge. Has a spacious downstairs and I haven't been upstairs but it looks spacious up there too. I really really really love the map decor on the wall....  II tried the coffee, iced americano, and sweetened green tea. and I tried the bear claw and the morning bun (both really good! not sure if they bake in house or bring it from elsewhere) Honestly... the drinks are not SUPER special (I feel the same way about Ground Zero) but it's good. Most of the chairs don't have cushion, but it's fine. I still manage to sit on those chairs for hours. Extra points for space and environment. AND DRIVE THROUGH IS AWESOME. There is a parking garage and lots of street parking... but you also have to battle for spots with people who live in the building haha"}
{"text":"This location is a cozy, yet cool loft space. Very urban but welcoming feel. Coffee is amazing!! Their soy milk for lattes is creamy and wonderful which is important info to share considering soy/nut milk can be hit or miss at area coffee shops! Very pleased. They have a drive through if you are in a hurry that you enter through the parking garage.  But do yourself a favor and come in and enjoy the space!"}
{"text":"The spacious and thoughtfully decorated interior, easy parking, and central-ish location makes Cargo Coffee East a no-brainer spot for productive weekend working sessions.   The chai chiller was tasty and icey, if a tad pricey. The time I ordered an iced mocha it was really clumpy, but strangely this made it more delicious. Undissolved mocha powder came up like little pockets of sweet surprises in every sip. For a more standard go-to, I'd opt for one of their hot and crema-y Americanos, and I'd probably skip the pastry case.  I really like the eclectic mix of furniture, which gives you options in case you want to bench it or lounge it. While the metal adds a nice industrial touch, watch out for the vampire chairs that will suck the heat from your body -- unless you're into that sort of thing.   Service may be a little confusing if you're used to optimized, cookie cutter delivery, or if you're the type of person who feels anxious in new spaces. A surly looking bearded man may politely walk your drink out to you, or you might have someone shout your drink from the counter when it's like zero people busy, or you might ask for water and they pour you a glass even though there's self-serve water by the bussing station. Oops...but thanks!"}
{"text":"Yay!!! A coffee shop right below my building!  Pros: It's downstairs. I can literally roll out of bed, down the stairs, and into the coffee shop.   It's got a drive through!! Perfect for days like these! (aka subzero temperatures with wind chills that don't even make sense).  Free wi-fi! Everything is better free. Fact.  Cons: The interior is kind of cold. Not cold in the physical sense, but cold in the this-place-is-kind-of-depressing sense. I realize the direction of the coffee shop doesn't really bring in much sunlight, which would definitely liven this place up.  I suggest having more lamps (maybe have a few torchiere floor lamps by the corners to add some general lighting).   Otherwise, their selection of drinks is pretty standard, and the service is efficient and fast."}
{"text":"I'll start with saying that we have consistently stocked our place with Cargo's Nicaraguan and Atomic Blend over the years. Their coffee is delicious and Cargo/Ground Zero locations are often one of the better places to get some work done in Madison.   This review primarily refers to the coffee catering of this particular location. We placed an order for coffee catering on the 30th. Communication and payment seemed relatively smooth, and I confirmed several times the date and location of delivery. Unfortunately, there were several errors in the execution of our order. A week before our event, I received a message from Cargo that our coffee was already at our venue. This, of course, freaked me out because it was the wrong date. I was relieved to soon receive another text that indicated it was their mistake and that we would have our coffee at our event. On the evening of our event, our coffee was not delivered on time. When our coordinator placed a call to Cargo, they said that they messed up and thought the event was the next day. They then delivered the coffee late and forgot to provide creamer.  I will acknowledge that the staff was apologetic and did everything they could to make things right, including coming back to bring some creamer. However, these mistakes remain pretty disappointing as it caused additional stress and unnecessary delays for our event."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new coffee spot to check out on Saturday, and stopped in at Cargo.  It was okay.  The place is certainly nice bright and spacious. There are plenty of seating options and some nice cozy areas. There is a nice large table towards the back for larger groups.   The coffee was fine, but my chai was only okay. A little too milky and not enough chai flavor for me personally. The bear claw was really good. I passed on the food, because the low prices made me question how good the quality would be.  The staff all seemed nice, but the lady who took my order (a little older with bottle blonde hair and glasses) was slow and seemed confused. Perhaps she is new?  The atmosphere there isn't really my thing. The crowd was a little too snobby/hipster.  Maybe I'll check it out again, but I won't rush back. Plenty of better coffee shops in town. If you want a stellar coffee shop experience, try Lakeside Street Coffee House."}
{"text":"I often hit up the drive thru on the way to work for a cappuccino, so I'm not the best person to ask a out food and pastries and such, but service is always prompt and the espresso drinks are good. My boyfriend likes their scones, but I haven't personally tried them. Inside is nice and comfortable. It's fast becoming a regular for me."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great staff. Plenty of power outlets. I truly enjoy this space. It's airy, bright, and has a great vibe to it. Particularly great is the coffee, which they roast themselves across town, and also sell in bean form for home use. The Atomic Brew is still my favorite."}
{"text":"This place has been more than a coffee shop these past months.   During my first Wisconsin winter and polar vortex it was a place of warmth. Best apple cider I've ever had! (Wish this wasn't only a winter drink, I've tried ordering many times throughout the summer but still not available.)   When I was redeeming my first free drink from the frequent buyer card, they concocted a new drink miracle the barista named the Rusty Tugboat: apple cider with a shot of espresso. Surprisingly delicious.  The coffee is great both ways, hot or iced. I love grabbing an iced coffee on the way to the Farmer's Market downtown.   Later once I started getting into the nitty gritty of my new job this place offered a great work-from-home space. So many outlets and quiet nooks to work in. Spent many days sipping the lesson plans away over the weekend. Very peaceful and good area to focus. The wifi connection is free and works.   Just tried the new greens smoothie, super delicious. Can't wait to see what they bring to the menu next!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good coffee. Good espresso. Good bakery items. Nice staff. Free wifi and plenty of outlets/ places to study.  About the same prices as Starbucks.  The non-cafe food like wraps and soups are just ok.  They have great apple cider (winter months only). If you ask for the rusty tugboat (off-menu item) you will get a unique cider/espresso fusion that's surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"My daily drive through experience: - Exchange witty banter with the  barista at the window :) - Order, \"the usual\" - Check in on yelp! - Get my Cargo Coffee Card punched. I'm almost to my next free drink! - Pull forward to the next window - Receive and drive away with delicious, 3-shot Americano - Pat myself on the back for not ordering 1000 carbs of moist, delicious, chocolate chip pumpkin bread  Other things I could probably do while in the drive through if I was so inclined: - Log onto the reliable wifi network - Probably plug something into an electrical outlet. I wouldn't be surprised if they had one in the drive through window."}
{"text":"Very good coffee shop. I came in today to get a little work done without the distractions at home, and was pleasantly surprised with the layout. Lots of space to sit, many tables with two seats plus a handful of big ones if you're here with a group. The second floor / mezzanine is especially a nice touch.   The coffee is good enough to want a second cup.   I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The iced coffee is addicting. Love this place. Very quaint and chill inside for studying or a coffee date. Fun outdoor seating and good bites for all meals of the day. They also serve wine and beer for really fair prices. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Cargo Coffee is a most excellent place to while away an afternoon working or hanging out with friends or reading or whatever your heart desires.   It's big and open and spacious.   The people working there are friendly.  They have a great selection of drinks and an okay selection of snacks.  Free Wi-Fi.  Ample parking.   And if you are in a hurry they also have a drive thru, which is pretty top dollar."}
{"text":"Last week was my first time visiting this coffee shop. I made the horrible mistake of parking in the lot next door that was a private business. After my meeting, I walked out to see that the gate was locked, everyone was gone, and they would not return until Tuesday. Which would have left me carless for four days. I went back to the coffee shop and asked the owner and if he could do anything. He called the business next door and begged them to come back and get my car from out of the gate. Since then I have made sure to return to this coffee shop several times and I have told at least five other people about their amazing customer service. Thank you Cargo Coffee!"}
{"text":"They have excellent coffee. The mocha I ordered was smooth and had no bitterness to it. I hate bitter/burnt tasting coffee. None of that here. I really enjoyed their chicken salad wrap bursting with cucumber, swiss cheese, tomato, and freshly prepared chicken salad wrapped in a tomato tortilla.  They serve their wraps/sandwiches with their soup of the day or a small bag of Lays potato chips, a pickle and some greens also come on the plate with your sandwich.   This is the only Cargo I have been to and I love the layout of the place with the different environmental options. You want light and a group setting sit on the first floor in front of the huge windows with couches or large tables with multiple chairs. You want something darker, a little more secluded and conducive to solitary studying/working go up the stairs and sit and look down over everyone else while you sip your coffee at a small, 1-2 person table."}
{"text":"Befitting its name, Cargo Coffee is home to an inspiring globe-trotter theme, incorporated consistently throughout the business in enormous cartographic displays and striking decor.   Solid drinks and eats, along with quality service. A generous selection of baked goods is available, plus several varieties of beer and wine. Prices are noticeably lower than around the Capitol, and coffee refills are offered for just $.85.    Nonetheless, the top-notch ambiance is where this place really shines: wall-sized windows, immaculate lighting, and a spacious environment... what's not to like? More than worth it for the atmosphere alone.  Whether you're looking to catch up with an old friend, meet for lunch with colleagues, work on a group project, read for pleasure, or focus intently on hammering out a few more pages of your thesis, Cargo Coffee diverse array of workspaces and seating arrangements means you're sure to find a spot that fits your needs! (For getting work done, I'm particularly a fan of the semi-private upstairs area.)"}
{"text":"Cargo Coffee definitely gets props for its super-modern decor and fun \"balcony\" area above the main part of the restaurant. I also enjoy the fact that it has a collection of games patrons can play, even if they are limited.   I know this may be sinful, but I can't STAND their coffee. I have now tried a latte in two locations, and I have never had such bitter espresso (and I drink a LOT of espresso). It is like they take the darkest roast possible and burn it. On both occasions, I have not been able to finish my drink, and it leaves a terrible aftertaste in my mouth. I just. Can't. Do it. Sorry, Cargo."}
{"text":"Lots of outlets, a huge window, and spot lighting makes this a really nice location to study and do some work.    I had their chix wrap sandwich which is chicken salad as a wrap.  I found it slightly heavy on the mayo, but otherwise well composed.  I also had their jasmine green tea which is better than many places' tea selection.    My only gripe is that it gets kind of loud due to the expresso machines or coffee grinder or whatever it is that creates this ridiculously loud noise.  It happens at other coffee shops too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly with my study partner for at least two years now.  We chose Cargo Coffee because of ample parking both on the street and the parking garage as well as plenty of space inside with available outlets and wifi.  Prior settling on this establishment we tried other coffee shops on the near east side and no one was as \"easy\" as Cargo as far as parking and getting a table.  Cargo also has great hours.  Open late on weekends and holidays.  When I want a coffee at a weird time, I don't have to worry about Cargo disappointing me.  My only issue is the baristas often seem a little cranky.  But, obviously that hasn't deterred me from being a regular customer.  And frankly, I might be that way a little too dealing with the occasional difficult customer as I'm sure those who work in customer service are used to."}
{"text":"Love the open and sunny space. I am not a coffee drinker, but their tea selection is fairly good (though their choice of quality green teas is limited). I usually have the ginger tea.."}
{"text":"Cargo is my go-to coffee shop, hands down. It's a perfect space to hunker down and get work done or to meet with friends or colleagues. It can get a bit noisy given the big, open space; but it's to be expected in a coffee shop with a commercial espresso machine. I personally love the $3 beer and wine offerings - all day, every day!"}
{"text":"The decor at Cargo Coffee was very welcoming and airy--there were lots of places to sit and hang out for awhile.  Even better, there was a little seating area outside to enjoy a drink in the nice, summer-y weather.  There's not a lot of food options here, but you can definitely get a good caffeine buzz going on with their coffee and espresso selections.  My cappuccino was on point and even though this isn't my favorite coffee shop in Madison, I'd definitely pay Cargo Coffee another visit."}
{"text":"I am totally digging the atmosphere at Cargo. Bright, airy, lots of different seating and lighting options, and super-rad Picasso-influenced art by kids on the back wall (at least for now). They also have perks like free covered parking and a drive-thru window. Solid.  Being a coffee shop, they unsurprisingly have a coffee-heavy drink menu. As someone who can't have caffeine, I wish they had a few more caffeine-free cold drink options in the summer, but I can't hate - I didn't go to a juice bar, I went to a coffee shop.   I did snag some lunch on my last visit, though, and it was tasty and filling. I went with the Green Wrap, which was impressively green and featured extra-crunchy vegetables. The homemade hummus was really hearty and didn't squish out with every bite. It also came with a giant pickle spear that I didn't expect and was pumped to see on my plate. Bonus!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to see this Cargo location struggling.  Not in the sense of volume but in terms of flow of operations. The counters and tables were not clean. 15 min to get a latte with just one person inline ahead of me. The counter person seemed overwhelmed and had to run for a calculator in order to make change.   With the drive through in full swing the barista was just getting more and more behind. There was a guy in back county money - so they must be doing OK... Might have been helpful if he jumped in to get the counter and drive through caught up. The young man making food and running the drive through seemed pretty disheveled and probably should have had a hat or hairnet on.   Don't get me wrong - you should patronize the local joints and Cargo in general at their other locations does a better job. Oh and my latte was OK."}
{"text":"After a long morning at the Madison Farmers Market, Cargo was a breath of fresh air.   Our family has a connection with airplanes so the sign out front completely caught our attention. We didn't know what to expect as we were traveling in from Ohio but we were so glad we stumbled upon Cargo!   Inside is an adorably designed travel themed shop with two stories. It is clean, bright and perfect for a coffee date. The top floor is perfect for a college student to relax and study.   The prices are fair, maybe a little on the high end. A green smoothie was shy of $5 but the portion was large! And the taste, oh man! Sometimes with the green drinks, you are taking a gamble but I'm so glad I did! The banana and mango fit perfectly with the spinach and cider.   My husband asked for a caramel macchiato which was not on the menu. The lady asked, \"Starbucks or traditional?\" He was so happy she knew the traditional way. He enjoyed his macch.   There is a nice patio out front and plenty of space inside. Oh, and they serve a few beers. Hoping something like this finds its way down to Cincinnati."}
{"text":"LOVE. JUST. LOVE.  Spacious.  OUTLETS GALORE.  Super friendly staff.  Comfy seating perfect for gettin' werk done.  Did I mention the vegan baked goods?  Gigantic painting of the Soviet Union (I feel at home). (JK). (Kind of)."}
{"text":"Friendly baristas and a large selection of coffee drinks! The space inside is really spacious, and they have a patio as well. Great for meeting up with a study group or getting some work done if you're tired of working at home. They have many outlets and wifi. I wish they were open later than 9pm, though. Still close enough to campus to warrant later hours."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's enough just to have someone else make and bring you dinner.   Cargo's green wrap (minus the green peppers, nice that they make them up fresh and don't serve them pre-made) was just what I needed. At a modest $5.15, it's affordable, and surprisingly filling. The green flour wrapper is very thin, which I prefer, and the fillings are fresh with lots of crunchy dark greens, hummus, cucumbers, onions, cheese and tomatoes. The service was quick, as well.  So nice and quiet, smooth music, with many choices of where to sit, as it's multi level. If you need privacy, you can have it, or if you want to watch the world go by through the glass front, you can have that too.  With Star Bar next door, they could probably expand their evening hours. Wish they weren't closing at 9. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"The new Cargo Coffee location is a wonderful addition to the near East side.  It retains all the positive attributes of their Park Street location (friendly service, bold roasts, geographic theme) in a new vibrant setting.  In addition to their flavorful bold, aromatic coffees, this location offers pastries, a small lunch menu, wine and beer.  The location offers a variety of seating options.  You can socialize with friends sitting in the comfy chairs and sofa in the entry area with high ceilings and illuminated with natural light from two story glass windows.  If you need to turn out a project, grab an Atomic Roast and head over to the dimly lit upper deck area.   Things I liked: * Free, fast wi-fi.  Even though the place was packed with an army of laptop-toting students, the performance of my wi-fi connection did not suffer. * Drive through window * The pleasant, efficient staff thoroughly explained the different blends offered that day to this appreciative first time visitor. * Free parking in the entire first floor of the parking garage (enter on Livingston Ave) * The loyalty punch card works also works at the other Cargo Coffee location on Park and Ground Zero on Willy Street.  Ten punches gets you a free drink.  Things I didn't: * A small quibble, but I would like to see more sofas and comfy chairs.    The availability of free parking on the near east side will definitely make Cargo Coffee East a location I frequent often."}
{"text":"The BEST coffee shop in Madison with the exception of Ground Zero! Wait, they are managed by the same owners.  Exceptional customer service, unique, fun and comfortable seating, and atmosphere.  The prices are very reasonable and affordable and the parking is ample.  The owners are wonderful citizens who give back to the community.  Oh yes, and the maps are really cool.  The artwork in the ladies room is beautiful and created by the owner who is also an artist!"}
{"text":"Oooooooooooo la la!   Aren't you fancy Cargo East aka Other Ground Zero.   I like what you're doing here, and I'll be miserable when everyone discovers how easy it is to park, how lovely it is to order, and how kind my barista was to march my Americano up the stairs.   There are outlets EVERYWHERE! And a range of seating options. You'll be just as comfortable in a huge group as I was with one other person.   The drive through situation is pretty rad too, is there another good East Wash drive though I don't about? Pull into the covered parking from Livingston, which is perfect for snowy or rainy days."}
{"text":"What a cute spot in Madison! We were on our way to tailgate for the Wisconsin Madison v northwestern game on a Saturday morning, and decided to spot by here and grab breakfast. I decided on a flaky and buttery bacon egg and cheese croissant while my fiancé and his friend got their breakfast burrito.  There was quite a bit of people in the cafe but the food came out quick enough!"}
{"text":"The decor is great at all the Cargo Coffee shops. The staff is nice. I have only had a breakfast sweet roll to eat. I've had the tea and it's very good."}
{"text":"I stopped here as part of the Caffeine Crawl last weekend.  The space is very inviting and clean.  Lots of different areas for studying, reading, or conversing with friends.    We were served a cold espresso drink.  It was nice but not my ideal drink.  I am sure the stars will increase at my next visit.  The staff seems very passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"Outlets. So many freaking outlets! I love Ground Zero, but the space is not very conducive to doing group work with computers. I need to power all my crap. Piles of it. And Cargo cares about my crap.    So, Cargo Coffee East is the place for me.   Also, the coffee is good or whatever. Is that what people do here? Drink coffee?"}
{"text":"Came here in an extremely hot day... Tried the atomic freeze, which is like blended iced mocha, but with a very creamy texture and that amazing smell of tiramisu! They have a lot of seats, and you'll immediately fall in love with the very relaxing atmosphere. The staff are so friendly that you easily start chatting with them while you wait for the coffee. The meals also look nice. Would drop by another time to try them."}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite coffee shop in Madison, but it does the trick when you need some caffeine.  I live in the building above Cargo Coffee, so a quick visit in here in mostly for convenience.   Although the coffee is good, the place is spacious, and it is outlets galore, I was turned off by my most recent visit.  My latte was considerably more expensive than other local places and the music was SO LOUD that I couldn't work. I was also pretty hungry when I stopped in, but there weren't many food options (bagels, muffins, pastries).  The drive through situation looks pretty cool and I haven't had a chance to try that yet, so I may update after that, but I haven't been blown out of the water with this place."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is a hit and a stealer, whatever you want to call it. It certainly has stolen my attention from some other coffee shops that I (used to) love in Madison. Today is my third time to visit and study in this comfy place this week. It's been more than 10 times in total (at least that's what my loyalty card told me, ha!) Call me a betrayer as I am no longer in love with the coffee shop I used to adore, but this place is just so generous with their space, and their wifi. Yeah, I write this review partly because the other coffee shop is now limiting their WIFI usage on weekends (WTH?!!). So, yeah, I have found my other love, which is so much nicer!  I have found a cozy spot to read, write or even to daydream while sipping my coffee or my Green smoothiessss. Of course, this spot is very popular. Come early, as they say,  early birds get the worm!   I don't think I need to say much about the space, as other yelpers have said it all.  This place certainly offers a bigger and more convenient study place! :) You won't regret it. Come early on weekends as the spots are filled up pretty quickly.  They also have loyalty cards too! so, ask those friendly baristas to give a punch of your card after your transaction! And when you are hungry some healthy and affordable wraps are at your service!  See you soon at Cargo coffee East, then? :)"}
