{"text":"The most delicious avocado toast for brunch ever! Jackson, in the kitchen, is a master."}
{"text":"This resort is absolutely amazing!! Not only does it have a cool and unique vibe, but the staff is so welcoming and the food is so tasty! The entire experience was one of a kind (my entire family agreed) from the unique style that is like nothing else in Scottsdale, to the exotic cocktails, and I of course can't forgot the presentation of the food was on point and every bite was so tasty!!! The chef was very personably and tied all the amazing dishes to things grown locally.  Morgan, Jake and Kristen made some of the best cocktails I have had and very creative in recommending drinks that I had never tried.  Sue was our excellent server who was a pleasure to talk to and great attention to detail on ensuring we had the best experience possible.  We also had the pleasure of meeting the GM, Scott Mason, and he ensured our experience far exceeded our expectations.  Meredith is the wedding coordinator who I have had the pleasure to work with around my upcoming wedding and she is on point! She has been so accommodating in working with us to ensure our special day is everything we could imagine and more! I highly recommend you check out this resort...whether it be for dinner, pool time, wedding events or to just check out some of the great activities they have planned for the community!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review as a VERY happy recent bride. My husband and I were married on March 13, 2017 at the brand new Andaz Resort and Spa. And I am ecstatic to say that there is not one thing I would change about our decision to book Andaz for our wedding and reception... well, maybe one thing.... I wish we had found them sooner!

My husband and I are both very detail-oriented individuals with high expectations, a predilection for making special requests, and a shared vision for what we wanted our wedding to be - and the Andaz team could not have done a better job making our dreams a reality.

We planned a \"modern black tie\" event. Our colors were black, white and gold. We were going for sleek, timeless, and sophisticated, with a little bit of modern edge. (I've included photos for reference).

My husband and I knew what we wanted, and we weren't afraid to ask the Andaz team to accomplish our vision. Let me tell you - they were SO accommodating. They made us feel that our crazy requests were completely attainable. In fact, they made everything we asked for happen, from designing us a gorgeous modern cake for our reception, to providing a beautiful dance floor free of charge, to letting us use whatever furniture they had on site (complimentary), to hanging bistro lights just for our day, to even sending someone to Nordstrom the day of because the Groom forgot his tuxedo pocket square. 

They did EVERYTHING you could imagine and, when asked, always replied, \"Of course, we can make that happen.\"

We felt so taken care of by them... and our guests felt so taken care of by them - which was a huge stress relief for this detail-oriented couple.

While the entire Andaz staff was absolutely wonderful, I must highlight one person in particular: Meredith Morris. Meredith is the event coordinator for Andaz. She is also a guardian angel, fairy godmother, genie, and wonder woman. 

Meredith orchestrated everything to perfection (no surprise since she's been in the wedding planning industry for years). She made sure that no corners were cut. She made certain that everything, down to the very last detail, was handled seamlessly (often without my involvement... which I am so grateful for!). 


Thank you so much Andaz for your outstanding service and attention to detail! The Andaz team made our wedding the most magical, seamless, stress-free day of our life. You know how people always say that something goes wrong on the wedding day?... Nothing went wrong on our wedding day! I couldn't be more enthusiastic to write this review for the Andaz.
If you choose to have your wedding at Andaz, they will go out of their way to make your dreams a reality. 

Love,
A very, very happy bride."}
{"text":"The Andaz was a great experience.  The grounds were clean and inviting.  The employees were helpful and kind.  The food was a treat because the chefs were encouraged to express their creativity.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  We especially enjoyed meeting the artists who visited the property.  We feel this Andaz caters more to adults who want to enjoy a simple weekend away."}
{"text":"Trendy, chic, hipsters - watch out W and Ace - Hyatt is giving you a run for your targeted branding money. I would highly recommend any Palm Springs  boutique hotel regulars give Andaz Scottsdale Resort & Spa in Scottsdale AZ a try. You will definitely be impressed!!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous property but disappointing. Pool bar closes at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. on Saturdays.) When service at the pool was available, my husband and I were ignored for the bachelorette parties. I guess there were two more pools but no one ever told us where they were. 

We paid $88 in resort fees and only single yoga session and two wine tastings were offered over the weekend. 

Ended up just driving up to Sedona for a full day and not spending a lot of time at the resort like we initially planned. 

So, gorgeous property, but disappointing."}
{"text":"Okay, we usually stay at the four seasons, but wamted. To be closer to downtown Scottsdale. I dont like to review harshly BUT we asked days before and everyone was complaining about the Jacuzzi being sooo cold. It became a  kiddie pool (i have kids and love kids ) but this was ridicoulous! Kids splashing in Jacuzzi.  The service was slow and u have to pay extra to use  the  spa.  Defintely going to deive the 30 min into Scottsdale and stay at the Four Seasons. Only great thing is Mike the bartender.  Beat drinks, but not from the menu. They should let him create the menu!!!"}
{"text":"The former Cottonwoods Resort has been reborn into a new, sleek, modern Andaz property that feels like it could be 20 miles from anywhere, even though it is a block off Scottsdale Road.  My wife and I were there for drinks as the sun set and the moon came up...the view of Camelback Mountain and the wide open, star-filled sky was incredible.  The service was terrific, the menu selection top notch, and the vibe was comfortable yet sophisticated - or sophisticated, yet comfortable.  It looks like it would be a great place to hold a wedding or some other celebration.

I really don't get the complaints about the restrooms.  There are  about 10-12 private toilets - each marked W/M, as is becoming common nowadays, with a central, spacious set of sinks.  There was nothing remotely creepy about it, and it was head-and-shoulders above a typical public restroom in terms of cleanliness.  The reviewer who found it \"DISGUSTING!\" needs to develop a bit of maturity.

I'm a local resident, and Andaz has been kind of under-the-radar so far.  I assume at some point they will have a grand opening, but for now it is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is first rate!! We had an amazing time here this summer! The resort is just breathtaking!   I love that all the rooms are individual casitas instead of a large, multi story building of hotel rooms.  The whole vibe is creative and artistic.  We were even able to get a lesson from a local artisan on felting while sipping on delicious wine.  The manager, Sophia, could not have been nicer or more welcoming to our family.  She was cheerful and thoughtful and we appreciated all of her efforts while we were there.  Our days were filled with lots of pool fun- they have huge pool floats for everyone to enjoy including a giant cactus, a swan and a huge pineapple.  We had breakfast daily at the restaurant.  Ben was our server most of time and he always greeted us with a smile!  We had several kiddos eating with us when our friends joined us- this has it challenges but Ben made it seem easy.  He was helpful with our seating, patient with our ordering and the food was delicious!  Bravo Sophia and Ben- you made our trip very special!  Thank you!  We will be back in December and hope to see you!"}
{"text":"Very unique, chill, modernly designed hotel with the warmest hospitality.   This place is especially beautiful at night!"}
{"text":"Awesome resort.  Just finished a weekend there with my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary.  We could not have had a better experience!

What was Awesome?

Scott-  This GM of facilities was omnipresent and congenial offering assistance when needed but his presence made everyone bring their \"A-game\" while simultaneously creating a positive and fun environment.

The girls (and boy) at the front desk were spectacular.  EVERY time we came to the front of the building they asked how our stay was going, what they could do to help us and what we wanted from them now.  Very professional and accommodating.

Each meal was full of surprises and deliciousness.  The breakfasts were particularly special but we enjoyed each meal.  Scottsdale seems to have a city-wide competition going to have the best food and the Andaz is right up there with all the rest.  Aaron was a great server among many special waiters and waitresses.  Florian, who runs the food and bev side of the Andaz, was also a standout over the weekend we had.

The bar was fun and not over the top.  Its not the main focus of the hotel but it has neat little nooks and crannies to sit and have privacy or you can belly up with \"Mike and Mike\" for some homespun drinks and fodder.  These two tenders continually made us drinks that weren't on the menu, which was a fun.

Noelle and Jesse were great!!  these young ladies literally ran your food and drinks and anything else you needed to you.  My wife and I were tired watching them but they assured us they were \"having fun at work.\"

The cleaning group was prompt , efficient and kind.  we needed a few special things (a coffee mug, ice and a humidifier) and they were brought to us immediately.  

The weight room was awesome.  Check out the pics on the website but it has a garage door opening to a wonderful view which made the burpees only slightly less painful.

The location initially concerned me but immediately faded after we entered the grounds.  The Andaz is right off of Scottsdale road so you feel like you're turning off a busy road in to the facility, which you are, but as soon as you get out of the car you're transported to a resort feel and ambiance.  The best part is you're close to everything at this locale!

Highlights:  Meals, the grounds, rooms are very cool, pool is solid and the outside bar was fun.  It also didn't suck being driven around Scottsdale in a Tesla which are the shuttle vehicles for the Andaz.

nothing is perfect, so what could be improved? 

 I thought the sound system was a little lacking at the pool.  No real bass though the music selection was very good.  Also, the spa is on the small side though it offers what other resort spas offer in the area.

Long review but I hope it was helpful.  Great place, enjoy!"}
{"text":"The valet and reception service=4 stars. The bungalow itself =3 stars. The greeting we received from Natalie was excellent. She was enthusiastic, had an authentic love and appreciation of the hotel and made us feel very special. The hotel pool attracted the tweens and young people. Swimming in a warm pool in 110 degree weather feels a bit weird but it was relaxing at the end of the day. The restroom set-up in the bungalows had a number of doors but none of them soundproof."}
{"text":"We recently spent 3 nights at Scottsdale Andaz.  This was our 1st visit to an Andaz and I'm not sure I would return.  The grounds are beautiful.  While the rooms are attractive in a stark sort of way, they are very uncomfortable.  Besides not having a desk, the chairs are very uncomfortable.  Most importantly, the lighting is very poor resulting in dark rooms.  So, with uncomfortable chairs and extremely low lighting, it is hard to use your laptop or even read.  Since the bathroom was very well lit, we often kept the bathroom barn door open to provide some light into the bedroom.  The closet is in the bathroom so if someone is using the sink, you can't use the closet.  Each room as a patio which if it had comfortable seating would be a great place to sit.  But once again the seating was uncomfortable.  We ate breakfast at the restaurant.  While pricey, the food was very good.  The pool area is beautiful.  The fire pit at the pool was great.  As we were checking out, we learned that there were a few more fire pits scattered around the hotel.  Unless you like loud music, do not get a room near the pool.  The resort fee is quite exorbitant and you don't get much.  The snacks that are included in the resort fee are soft drinks, chips, and hard taffy.  My husband ate the chips which you can probably get at Walmart.  Besides not liking taffy, we were afraid to eat it because we didn't want to lose a crown.  The water we drank.  The hotel car is a Tesla which probably wouldn't fit more than 3 adults plus the driver.  Since it's first come, you cannot depend on getting a ride.  And while you can be dropped off within the 5 mile radius, you will not be picked up.  FYI:  The Courtyard Salt River has a great shuttle service.  Supposedly roving carts providing complimentary sweet and savory treats are included in the resort fee.  We were there 3 days but were never provided with these treats.  All in all, the negatives outweigh the positives and I would probably not stay here again."}
{"text":"Loved our stay there!  Cool decor, staff was super friendly and personable, everything was great.  Had breakfast at the restaurant twice and was good, did not eat there any other time.  Pool was fantastic!  Loved the pina colada cocktail and hanging out on the floaties.  Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area."}
{"text":"The Andaz Scottsdale is fantastic.  The casitas are very well appointed and modern.  The amenities are great where the fitness room shines.  The fitness room opens up via glass garage doors to he spa pool and the equipment is top shelf.  The restaurant Welp was very good...try the Tuna appetizer and the hangar steak."}
{"text":"If you're coming to the Scottsdale area I highly recommend this amazing resort. The bungalows are top notch but the poolside bar took it over the top. Bartenders Kat and Breeze were simply the best. Great conversation, great service and it's here that I found my new favorite cocktail, Tequila Rose. Not too sweet but flavorful and refreshing. I wish I could take all of this home with me but from here on out we won't bother staying anywhere else. Those two sold it for us"}
{"text":"I spent 3 nights at the Andaz in 20F. The resort grounds, pool & staff were excellent. However; I did not feel safe in my room. All of the rooms are on ground level. This wouldn't be a huge issue if all of the doors to the room were secure. There were 2 doors to get into my room. The main door that required a key card & another glass door in the bathroom that opened to a small patio. There was a six foot high wall surrounding the entire patio. This glass door had a simple 'push button' lock.  It would take very little effort for an intruder to enter thru this entrance.  The other complaint was the fact that if I wanted any privacy while I was in my room, I had to keep my shades drawn. The windows were floor to ceiling and anyone walking by could see inside to the entire room."}
{"text":"I highly recommend ANdAZ Resort, formerly the Cottonwood Resort. It's a hidden gem beautifully located in Scottsdale, AZ located within walking distance to restaurants and shops. The property is so pretty and the casitas are nice and comfortable with a very accommodating staff. The pool is nice with covered seating and cabanas available with poolside food/beverage service with friendly wait staff. It's a great family place, they had a watermelon eating contest and water balloon fight for Labor Day holiday. The staff is very accommodating. Check them out, you will love it!"}
{"text":"From start to finish, the Andaz was exceptional. The service was on point with professionals that had wonderful and genuine personalities. The pool and the bartender, Jordan, was a perfect add on along with the spa treatment and amenities. The room was private, clean and perfectly appointed. I would come back in a heart beat! Thank you, Andaz, for being in of the best Hyatt experience I have had!"}
{"text":"Recently I had the opportunity to stay at the Andaz Scottsdale.  It really is one of my favorite properties and I can't wait to go back.  The property is bungalows spread about the property, you will find 4 or 5 attached to each other, they are all 1 story so you have no one above you or below you.  The desert landscape is beautiful, and the grounds are perfectly manicured with fire pits scattered around the property.  The rooms are mid-century modern.  Very clean, modern, yet retro.  We had an upgraded room, a king deluxe which gave us a private patio off of the bathroom as well as the little patio out front which all rooms have.  
The Andaz is trying a new concept, one I found very welcoming.  The hotel lobby is called the guest house and you are welcomed as though you are coming in to someone's home.  Very informal, with beverages being offered and delicious brownies upon check in.

The property has a lovely spa, wonderful pool with a grill and a private area called the Retreat, the perfect spot for a family reunion or multi-generational vacation.  The area is steps away from the other rooms, has its own pool.

When it came time to check out, I was bummed that we didn't have more time.  It was very relaxing, peaceful and we felt rejuvenated from our few days at the resort. 

The onsite restaurant Weft and Warp is absolutely delicious, give it a try. 

The staff couldn't have been more friendly.  Everyone on staff was welcoming, friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"GORGEOUS !!!  We recently moved to Anaheim Hills from Northern California and were invited to a wedding in the Scottsdale area.  It's not a bad drive and we will definitely be back.  The hotel is immaculate and staff was very friendly.  We were there for four nights (wish it was longer).  When we told the hotel we saw the rates got better during our stay they took very good care of us.  It's beautiful and off the beaten path.  Decor is well thought out and our nights there were very quiet.  Forget the noisy other hotels on the main drag this place was worth every penny !"}
{"text":"Ellen really made our stay comfortable.  She is warm, friendly and knowledgeable.  She is a wonderful part of the spa and such a great person to speak with - thank you Ellen for making the stay in Scottsdale so much better!  You really saved the trip and we look forward to visiting the spa again!"}
{"text":"Loved it here for a long weekend away from the kids with my husband!  Great breakfast, great pool, love the welcome reception, location and the vibe."}
{"text":"Wow, we stayed for a long weekend and I was so impressed with every aspect of the experience.  The beds were very comfortable with feather pillows and comforters.  The room had a sleek modern decor but warm, cozy elements were added and the connection to the desert landscape was evident.  The staff interactions were all wonderful.  The pool side drinks could have been stronger (but I think I'll always think that).  The restaurant's evening meal was the best we had in town and we visited other $$$ restaurants.  The morning service was slow but we think that was due to new staff being trained.  And unlike other reviewers, I really liked the co-ed bathrooms.  My husband has returned from the men's room on multiple occasions with our soiled son to tell me there simply wasn't a changing table in the men's room.  Well not so here!  There's a changing table and we could both go help out if needed (for those big messes).  I love that!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best vacation resorts. The people are wonderful !
The bellmen are always smiling and they have a hotel car ( tesler ) and will drive anywhere with in 5 miles. The front desk is as cooperative as any hotel I have ever stayed and they are always smiling. The restaurant does southwestern food great. I enjoyed the whole experience"}
{"text":"A stellar experience on all levels.  High-style design and incredible attention to every detail."}
{"text":"Worst customer service at an otherwise nice resort. I took my husband for a staycation for his birthday/our anniversary. At $300+ per night, you'd expect good service & heat in your room. I fortunately got a good deal, or else I'd be super upset. We had horrible service at restraunt twice, heat didn't work in our room (which they said was fine, but obviously it wasnt). Management did little to make up for the ruining of our stay. Would not recommend & will not likely return unless upper management does something to show they care. The 2nd day we had awful service, I looked up the yelp reviews for the restraunt & other people were posting too. Give your hard earned $ to an establishment that acts like they care, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Simply the best. Wonderful people, great facilities and delicious food. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Mediocrity! $18.50 for one well drink; am I being punked?! There are way better restaurants in close proximity and at half the price, dont waste your money here. Upside; you get to look at the pretty property while being gouged."}
{"text":"Nice, clean and relaxing. Great pool and great service. Allowed us to check out late."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to our already amazing resort scene in Arizona, but this place stands out as a smaller, boutique feel to your stay that isn't the same as staying at one of the big resorts in town.  Friendly staff, beautifully appointed rooms with super comfortable beds and amazing bathrooms, and nice amenities too - loved the flow yoga class and the free in room snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. Absolutely love the tie in with the art and it is played out nicely throughout the entire resort.  Definitely a great place for another staycation!"}
{"text":"As in true Andaz style, this minimalist hotel offers luxurious accommodation and a unique, artsy style. The rooms are new and gorgeous. The pool has a great atmosphere and the restaurant offers daily happy hour. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Andaz is a relative newcomer to the Scottsdale scene.  I chose it over other places in the area because of my Hyatt status and it's upscale appearance.  Overall it met most (but not quite all) of my expectations.  

The room we were given was an upgraded room in the back corner of the property.  They recommended parking by the room vs valet, a solid recommendation.  The room was comfortable with comfortable king bed, a large bathroom area, a double person shower, and a private walled patio in the back.  It was very quiet - only once in the 4 days did I hear a person in an adjoining room.

Breakfast is quite good, though the upscale, trendy breakfast items take longer to prepare than the standard eggs & bacon, so the service takes a bit longer than expected.  On some Sunday mornings they have live music playing during breakfast.  When we were there the performer used an amp, so the sound was a little loud for the indoor dining area (we chose to sit outside for that reason).

The pool area has plenty of chairs, towels, etc and private cabanas you can rent.  The service in the pool area is solid - they come around often enough but not too often to annoy you.  The place can be a bit of a scene with groups and women and groups of men coming to hang out and party it up.  But you get that all over Scottsdale in March and April.  And it can lead to nice scenery at the pool.

The exercise room has large roller doors they open up when the weather is nice with a view of a small pool (not the same pool as mentioned above) and the mountains in the distance.  It's a nice view when on the treadmill or elliptical.

My only complaint is the maid service doesn't seem to restock things.  We had to hunt someone down for a refil of the shower gel and other bathroom items.  That was a bit annoying.  Also, they were stingy on towels and the bed seemed quickly made.  Given the price of the rooms, I would have expected much more.

So overall a solid 4 stars, but certainly not 5.  I would return."}

{"text":"I was on a business trip in Chicago and I had a late flight back. It was my wife's birthday and I had called here a week or so earlier to make a reservation. I came straight from the airport to pick her up to surprise her, which I let them know. When we got there we were welcomed and they were very gracious. That was the end of that. We got our drinks, we were one of two tables in the restaurant. We waited forever then got an appetizer. We waited another 20 minutes while we watched the staff chatting. Against my better judgment I went ahead and ordered an entrée. After that took a while we decided we were just going to leave. The waiter asked what he was supposed to do with our order. I held back and didn't tell him what he could do with it. We got the check and as we left the manager did try to make it better. He brought a box with the birthday pastry that was supposed to be for her special night. I'll always remember this place as a place that ruined my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"This place was great! Super beautiful landscaping with nature trees. Really easy to access and close to Scottsdale. This is by far my favorite place to stay in Phoenix. 

Pros
-Really comfortable beds
-Clean rooms 
-Beautiful grounds/landscaping with lots of grass
-Hot tub and pool
-Easy to park
-Really great staff
-Good, tasteful room decor 

Cons
-My room (bigger king) didn't have overhead or floor lighting in the main room so it was kind of dark
-Shower was kind of broken (drainage and attachment was broken)
-Signage is challenging. Was hard to park at night and find my complex."}
{"text":"Andaz is a new resort.  At time of our stay it had only been open 2 months. Its beautiful rooms, luxurious property , and service can't be beat. Rooms are 4 to a building , one level with both a front and back entrance.   All units have a beautiful patio overlooking the beautiful zen like grounds.  But it is really the service that stands out.  Whenever we asked for anything it was always met with a yes and was always accommodated.  The entire staff during our stay was attentive without being intrusive.  The only issue was the kitchen in the restaurant is slow.  The food was delicious when it did arrive and the apologetic food and beverage team recognized this slowness as an area of improvement and went above and beyond to make reparations by giving us 1 meal entirely free and also sending a nice gift basket to our room.  Overall a wonderful place to stay and we plan to return for future trips to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Wow! From start to finish my experience as a guest was outstanding. Valet was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable and the check-in staff was super friendly and accommodating! Kudos to Anna who sincerely made my birthday weekend very special.  Thank you and I will be back very soon! :-)"}
{"text":"Stayed here over the weekend for a friend's engagement party! Check in was a breeze and I was able to check in early which was awesome! Garret the valet boy was super friendly and helpful. He showed me the grounds and took me to my room in the hotel golf cart. The room i stayed was super cute and modern. You can connect your phone to the tv via chromecast which is pretty awesome for all the nerds out there:) snacks and soft drinks in the room are complimentary! Very nice touch!! We were able to do a late check out as well so got to enjoy more pool time. The bartender made us a delish pineapple infused vodka drink. Service is impeccable everywhere you go!! Also they provide a free Tesla ride within 5 mile radius!! 
Keep up the good work!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful property with excellent location and close to everything.  We were upgraded to a casita with a king and a pool cabana which was a nice surprise. It also had an outdoor tv and the bedroom has a large tv as well. The entire place has a hip vibe , especially the pool area. We ate breakfast in the main building and love the avocado toast with egg so much that we also had lunch there again and they make it with a grilled chicken breast - love it! The music at the pool the next day was perfect and very relaxing. The pool has a separate menu from the main restaurant which I did not know. The front desk should inform guests of that. I hope to use the Tesla this evening for our trip to Eddy V's - I heard their pianist and live music/happy hour is a real treat. This morning we went to the Frank Lloyd Wright house \"Taliesin West\" for a 2 hour tour at 10am. We loved it! You can pre-book online and it's about 30 min away from hotel."}
{"text":"For the price you really aren't going to get a better room in Scottsdale.  Though the website advertises amazing views of camelback mountain--these are few and far between and certainly only from a handful of rooms.  Despite this, the grounds, for being in its infancy, are meticulously developed and curated.  The landscaping is so pristine, however, that it can at times seem inauthentic, and staged.  And surely enough, each morning I saw a gardener painstakingly raking perfect lines into the rock beds throughout the resort.

The pool is just okay, by Scottsdale standards.  The pool area has a modern, utilitarian look that isn't really my thing, but perhaps appeals to others.  I didn't drink at the pool, was dehydrated from morning hikes, but was asked routinely if I needed anything.  This is hard to find, good attentive pool service.  My big complaint with the pool is the LOUD music--so loud you can hear it with your own headphones in.  The noise level was obnoxious.  The crowd at the pool when I was there was very early 30's-mid 50's, and most of us were past the age where we enjoy blasting music.  People take their own music with them nowadays--so turn it down, way down.

The room was fantastic, despite not having a view of anything.  Huge TV, think 60\", mounted facing the bed.  Large king size platform bed--very comfortable, great sheeting.  Well stocked refreshment center with free snacks and NA beverages.  Alcohol for a fee, all top shelf if you get the shakes and need a quick fix.  By minibar standards, the alcohol wasn't *that* expensive, considering airplane bottles run $10-18 at most hotels, and they have pints of top shelf liquor for around $35 in the Andaz minibars.  The rooms have keurigs, which I'm not fond of, and I've come to appreciate the Nepresso machines that have become the standard at most high end hotels.  

The rooms come with robes, and his and her flip flops.  The bathroom is open, so modest couples may find this awkward, with a dual shower and no bathroom door except for a separate toilet.  Wouldn't bother me or my SO, but if you're a brand new couple traveling might be an issue.  The huge walk in \"gym shower\" is fantastic, and open lighting with skylight, glass doors and windows really bring the desert into this entire bathroom area casting an air of serenity.  Really beautiful.

Outside the bathroom is a private patio, with a dual chaise lounge, each side has it's own side table.  The chaise is completely walled off to the outside world, so clothing optional sunbathing is permissible if you're into that--no one can see over wall, but they can still hear, FYI.

Other notes--the parking situation is great, you can drive close to your casita or use Valet which is included in the resort fee.  They offer drinks multiple times a day, wine upon checkin, snacks, activities--so if you're looking for free stuff or things to do, this resort will keep you occupied.  Staff is for the most part friendly and helpful, though a notch below five star service.

A downside is that a large condominium complex is being built next to the Andaz, and the boxy, brown, brutal design is very unappealing to the eye and detracts from the simple beauty of the Andaz casitas, as it looms over the property.

This hotel is worth it.  I think it's priced right, and has everything you would expect in a high end hotel, and then some extras.  I've come to appreciate casita style resorts--that offer your own world away from what can often be crowded chaos (and noisy kids) at resort properties.  No hallways with drunks staggering around echoing off the walls, no running kids, and casita resorts allow you to be fully immersed in the beauty of your surroundings and the peace of the Sonoran desert."}
{"text":"Wow! What a beautiful place to spend the weekend. This resort does truly take care of its customers. 
We were checked in at 3:30 and the rest was just simply relaxing. 
Each unit has 4 rooms so it feels like you have your own well designed apt rather than staying at a hotel. Our room was super spacious and the bathroom was as big as our kitchen! Dual showerheads with enough room for dance moves! So much space to spread put the toiletries. Their provided soaps and sundries were skin loving!
It was a birthday surprise from the wife so the resort presented us with a bottle of champagne already on ice. An excellent touch. The bed was dreamily comfortable to watch the enormous flat screen. Even the chairs and lounger in the room were comfortable and designed beautifully. 
The well manicured grounds were peaceful to meander. No unit is far from the pool which offered towels, private cabanas, a full bar including a free daily adult beverage, pool toys, great music, and plenty of lounge areas. 
Rather than drive around for dinner, my wife treated me to dinner at the on-site restaurant. We arrived late and were surprised at the emptiness. But around 9pm, the place was full! The restaurant had some of the most interesting design elements, including a full service bar.
The food itself was simply delicious...eapecially the trout. Buttery and flaky, melted in my mouth. The Mexican street corn was the most flavorful I've ever tasted. To top the meal off, the restaurant comped me a birthday desert. Way to go!
Check was smooth and easy and later...noon! So more pool time. 
Highly recommended for any stay in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The Palm Springs in the Valley.

We stayed several times throughout the last year. Upon arrival you feel like you landed in California and are greeted with spacious areas, a modern architecture and great mountain views. 
Their rooms are very modern, clean and quite. We love their Avocado Toast for breakfast and recommend booking the spa appointment to round it all up. Best StayCation in town! Bring your floaty and hiking shoes."}
{"text":"This hotel is as definitely a different concept for me. The location is a little bit off from downtown Scottsdale, so you get the peace and quiet of a resort, but it's still convenient enough to get down there if you wanted to. I LOVED the rooms. Everything was so pretty and spacious. The hotel itself is gorgeous-especially at night. I additionally liked the fact that the gym and pool areas are 24/7, which not a lot of places have around there. Be courteous, and not too loud is all they ask for. 

My favorite part is the service. I am a Hyatt rewards member, so it was very easy for me to request items I needed through the app, and people in bicycles come and deliver it to you, which I think is so neat. Additionally, non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary in the mini bar, which is AWESOME since it gets scorching hot in Arizona and there are times where I didn't have the opportunity to go to a store and buy water. 

Would love to stay here again on my next visit! I would probably request a room facing \"in\" next time (towards the middle of the resort)."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I speak from my room. It's such a bummer. If you check out some of my other reviews I genuinely LOVE the Andaz hotels I've stayed at (Wall Street & Maui - Wailea locations) and was SO excited to stay here on a business trip as typically I think Andaz can do no wrong. 

I noticed a bug or two in my room when i returned from dinner. At first I thought oh, this is Arizona, it's hot & muggy out and I'm on the ground floor - they probably followed me in from outside. Then, I saw a few more specs on the floor, and having experienced them in homes before, I thought hmm, that looks like silverfish. But, I'm probably just seeing things because I'm a paranoid bug person. Then, I got up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and there it was - plain as day in the sink, a silverfish.

I'm sure some of this is just what happens when your entire hotel concept is based on everyone having ground floor, outdoor access rooms, but ew. I come to hotels to relax - business or otherwise - and who can truly relax when you keep finding creepy crawlies throughout? Major bummer from a chain I typically praise. You can do better Andaz!"}
{"text":"I've been to 35 countries and this tops the list as one of my favorite hotels. My wife and I stayed here with our 15 month old and had such a relaxing trip. The attention to detail throughout the hotel and the service was remarkable. I also found the pricing to be moderate."}
{"text":"My friend held an engagement party here at The Girard House.  This place is swanky: urban, new, modern, and upscale!  They had two cabanas, private entrance to the pool, huge patio area with plenty of seating areas, then in the house the vibe is cool and comfortable.  It is a dream!  The staff was very friendly and took the extra steps to taking me to the location of the house and directed me where to park for a shorter walk.  SWEET!  I would definitely stay here or recommend out of town guest.  I heard they have a spa there, so I will need to check that out!"}
{"text":"Words cannot express my gratitude to this hotel! I have stayed at The Andaz in Scottsdale multiple times since they opened about a year and a half ago and each time it has been a phenomenal experience. During this current weekend stay (the day before I was supposed to check out and fly home I might add) I came down with the crazy flu that is going around and ended up at urgent care with a dangerous, spiking fever. I have been unable to move, let alone fly home. The manager and staff at the hotel has been incredible. They offered to drive me to the ER when my fever was spiking, brought me a tea kettle and checked up on me and today they even brought me off the menu soup made by the chef. My husband and entire family is so grateful to everyone at the hotel, as they have been worried sick about me being stuck out here by myself and so sick. I'm looking forward to coming back here during Easter weekend...and being able to enjoy everything that this wonderful hotel has to offer."}
{"text":"A new, stylish and hip resort catering to the well-heeled and winner of a \"best new hotel\" award for 2017 from Condé Nast's Traveler magazine.  We stayed two nights at the end of February for a hoped for break from the cold up north.


Pros:
-Rooms are spread out in little 6-unit buildings scattered across a very large and well landscaped property featuring native plants in raked  (like zen gardens) beds as well as lush green grass that makes you want to toss off the shoes and walk barefoot 
-brand new property so the rooms are up to date with well thought out design including plenty of easy to reach places for recharging gadgets and great places to store clothes and feel at home
-massive airy and bright  bathroom and we had a huge shower (easily 6 feet by 6 feet) with two separate shower heads as well as a hand held showered wand 
-private 7-foot high walled patio in back of our room with two lounge chairs -very nice
-bedroom area was also quite large with a monstrous TV-maybe 60\"? Mounted on the wall.  Room was tastefully decorated in a sleek, understated style and the ceiling had what looked to be faux reclaimed wood for a touch of warmth 
-Not sure how full they were but it seemed quiet and we didn't hear others from our room
-room price includes free stacks and non-alcoholic beverages from the mini bar (although our wasn't fully stocked when we checked in).

Opportunities:
-while I liked the extra firm bed, my spouse did not
-Pillow-BIG disappointment-Rock-hard foam pillows or flat as a pancake feather ones-surprise given the premium price
-resort fees-I hate these, if it is a FEE it is optional-but as this is NOT OPTIONAL, just be honest with your pricing of the real cost of a room-it's not 1980 any more.
-Wi-Fi-not all that fast but there was good cell coverage from AT&T so didn't matter too much
-pool rules-one of the problems of catering to the affluent crowd is some guests seem to have a sense of entitlement-like the dad and his 10-year old kid treating the hot tub like it was there own personal space-going so far as to eat lunch-chicken fingers, fries and ketchup - while in the hot tub!  I know the staff has an \"as you wish\" mindset but perhaps reserve some spaces for adults only?

Bottom line-beautiful hotel with big spacious rooms, great bathrooms and premium pricing."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at this resort for 3 nights and loved every moment. The service is wonderful and the bungalows are perfect. We stayed in the comfortable and well designed Andaz XL king. I have always loved Hyatt's beds and this one was no different. My husband and I both slept well. The bathroom is AMAZING! The shower was very big and the sinks spacious. We also had a small patio with lounge chairs at the back of the casita. Only one pool was open while we were there, but that was all we needed. The cocktails are great and the pool staff was friendly and courteous, always checking on us and ensuring we were having a great time. The restaurant located in the resort, Weft and Warp, was lovely and served every meal as well as small bites you would never have to leave the resort if you didn't want to.  We will definitely be returning to this unique resort, especially when the spa has opened."}
{"text":"Very new, sleek and modern.  The hotel is spotless with the rooms being immaculate.  Kudos to them for pristine cleanliness!   Upon arrival I was checked in very quickly.  There is no waiting as check in begins as you drive up. Excellent customer service from valet, front desk, etc.  The room is ultra modern.  Very nice and comfortable. The shower is a conversation piece with the enormous size.  Lots of towels, robes, flip flops and complimentary mini bar snacks.  The gym is fine but I do like more cardio equipment.

The restaurant is very good. Small bites and family style with great taste.  Hen, swordfish, lamb belly and watermelon were all very tasty.  

The pool looked like a great spot to enjoy.  Love to come back and enjoy more time here.  5 star all around!"}
{"text":"All right, giving more stars - yoga class was awesome and free coffee in the restaurant area in the morning!

Just checked in, room we paid for with king bed is not available, got a room with two queen beds. There were crumbs on the floor and dresser in the room. The room itself is dark and dingy. On the bright side, it has a coffee maker!  Not sure what to think about the staff yet, not very welcoming so far."}
{"text":"We are a couple from San Francisco, LA, and NY and chose to have our wedding in Scottsdale specifically for the Andaz. After visiting 23 different venues, we wanted a wedding that broke from the same ballroom venue, meat/ potatoes/ rubber chicken dinner, and a retreat where all 120+ of our out of town guests could escape. We also wanted a cosmopolitan level of service and an aesthete both modern and hip without losing a tasteful 5 star feel. 
  The Andaz was that and more. Meredith Morris and staff at the presented an outstanding level of service that stood out from the rest. The moment we stepped on the property we were delighted by the craft cocktails, pistachio stuffed dates, world class menu at Weft & Warp, hospitable staff, and the charismatic aesthetic of modern cement floors mixed with vibrant hues and mid century modern furniture. Our guests loved the famous golf nearby and rented cabanas by the pool enjoying snow cones while waiting for our ceremony. 
  Rare to find, Andaz offers an area with it's own House, pool, and casitas. We rented the sexy Girard House to host a private welcome party to a view of the sun setting over the Camelback Mountain. We did not need to use as many flowers and props some venues might require because they may lack the natural beauty of the property itself.  The Cholla Lawn made for beautiful pictures with its symmetry and orange tree lines. Head chef Andy and team created a menu that was as delicious as it was beautifully presented in a family style setting around long farm tables (so many compliments from our guests!) 
 Meredith worked tirelessly to ensure that every detail was accounted for- challenging given we were from out of town and the hotel had yet to be completed. On top of meeting our picky requests, she went above and beyond and even left personalized welcome notes & flip flops in each room. This high touch service did not go unnoticed and everyone enjoyed this venue so much we will be returning for future getaways!"}
{"text":"Amazing new spot! The rooms are simple but very well laid out and full of sunshine. The hotel pool is fun and hip vibe. Spa is pricey and good amenities but not amazing like others in town.  The car service and check in folks are over-the-top amazing. They really gave the best customer service in town.  The hotel management is wonderful and helped us out with an issue we had dining one evening  - great service recovery.  It's not set up for kids but totally can work if you have older ones.  Proximity to non hotel restaurants and shops in walking distance is not something we are used to in Scottsdale but was really nice to have."}
{"text":"Amazing experience from start to finish!  The staff was without a doubt the best I have seen - even at other resorts like the Ritz. They were genuinely nice, helpful, and great in every way from check in to check out. THIS is what service is all about!!"}
{"text":"I came down here for the Oregon/UNC Final Four game and needed a place to lay my head. I wanted to be in a place that was close to the fun in downtown Scottsdale and Andaz is just that.

At the time of my stay, Andaz was still pretty much brand new.  It opened in January of 2017 and I was there at the beginning of April.  Because of that, they were still ironing out some kinks with their service, but nothing that was worth mentioning.  

All in all, the room was very modern yet comfy, the pool was wet, and the resort is a short trip to downtown Scottsdale.  I would stay here again."}
{"text":"I've never experienced this caliber of service at a hotel/resort, even ones that claimed to be fancy or boast a high price tag. The staff bends over backwards to do everything possible to make their guests happy, welcome, and comfortable. They seem genuinely friendly and happy. My stay was an unforgettable delight. I cannot recommend this resort and staff more highly. I'm so impressed. Andaz is worth every penny."}
{"text":"The staffs at this Andaz location are surprisingly well ... undertrained aka straight up clueless. No one can give a reliable answer to anything. 

From check in to valet to restaurant service, we were continuously given contradicting answers or \"how am I supposed to know\". 

Ex #1 - booked our room to include complimentary breakfast - asked 3 diff staffs to inquire what that breakfast would be - 3 answers \"from breakfast buffet to one entree per person to $60 for the entire room\". 

Ex #2 - Asked the check in staff to have someone bring our luggages and jackets to our room. Gave a friendly reminder to include our jackets (description of color and every detail possible). The bell boy only brought our luggages and delivered our jackets to another room. My husband had to walk back to the check in to find out what happened. Apparently the staffs were scrambling trying to back track where they could possibly delivered our jacket. 

Ex #3 - saw a resort trolley stopped in front of our lobby. We asked the check in staffs what that was for. No one had a clue.. \"they come regularly\". But where does it go? Can we go on it too? Is it complimentary? They honestly had no idea... what? 

The list goes on and on.. 
Extremely disappointed by this Andaz location. 5 star property with 2 star service. If it wasn't for the fact that we had stayed in other Andaz before (and had known better what their brand stands for), we would honestly never choose Andaz again."}
{"text":"Awesome resort!  We love staying here for the golf tournament every year.  Rooms are beautifully appointed and pool area is gorgeous!  Service is outstanding.  Our favorite bartender is Kat!  So so bubbly and outgoing and makes sure you have everything you need and more!  Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"As someone who recently had a lovely experience at the newly renovated Andaz Maui, I had high hopes for this major reno in the desert -- sadly, while the grounds were absolutely stunning, the quality of their staffing and services leave something to be desired. 

Boo and I decided to take a few extra days before a wedding in Mesa, and spent four nights on Property.  We arrived Wednesday night to a less than friendly welcome (the Andaz Maui property had attentive staff who made you feel immediately accommodated) -- we found our casita with little trouble, but then went on to experience a frustrating first night: from oddly rubbery flattened cornish game hens peacocking as \"fresh grilled chicken\" to incredibly uncomfortable pillows and a thermostat that wouldn't regulate, we were remiss that we'd strayed from the comforts of a 4S, although throughout our stay the comfort of the room improved slightly. (Consistently, though, room service had....trouble. We called for, and were promised, but never received, sparkling water with lemon on another night, and the room service staff would curiously leave half consumed beverage containers out with coasters over them.)

The saving grace of the rooms, however, are the glass walled, gigantic two+ person shower, the Instagram ring-light worthy mirror lighting, and the lovely private back patio with chaises for when the terrible acoustic performer by the pool played a slow-version of Toxic for the fourth time and you just couldn't bear it.

The highlight of our stay was the time spent at the pool (my girlfriend is  a sun worshipper) -- the staff there, while overworked, were endearing, and made our days pleasant with more attentive service than at the house restaurant, and we had a great experience both in the cabanas and at the spa pool (although it should be a consideration that for a \"silent pool\" experience you have to pay another $20 access fee on top of the daily \"resort fee\") 

The gym was clean and on par with what you'd expect for a 24-hour facility and was stocked with extra pairs of headphones, as well as fruit, towels, etc. 

We ate daily breakfast at the house restaurant, which was forgettable at best (we were really expecting more due to its recent accolades), but we were able to enjoy some locally curated nitro coffee and standard southwestern fare. Annoyingly, the restaurant did not offer its regular menu on Sunday (Mother's Day), which they failed to inform us of until after we returned from breakfast at around noon -- by way of a stealthily placed note on the couch. We also had several odd interactions with restaurant waitstaff who were, like, questioning our food choices, but other than that, no major complaints. 

We'll be returning to Scottsdale later this summer, but will probably be skipping the Andaz, unless major improvements are made to their infrastructure."}
{"text":"Thank you World of Hyatt Membership and the Andaz for the upgrade to the XL King bungalow.  The modern space was amazing.  I enjoyed my 3 night stay in the room from the nice new bed, the shower, and very big screen TV.  The TV covers the length of the bed and was hung on the wall at the best angle to enjoy movie watching in bed.  The gym is very nice also with all amenities - headphones, towels, water, and fruit.  

In Phoenix for work and decided to stay in Scottsdale last week to avoid the commotion of the Trump rally.

I did not get a chance to utilize the resort premium amenities such as the pool, spa, scheduled events and Tesla transportation.

The property staff is very hard working.  Every morning the landscaping and restaurant crew are hard at work to maintain the property.  The cleaning crew works late as I see them walking back from the fitness center."}
{"text":"The Andaz restaurant offers personalized service, quirky drinks, and fresh gourmet food. The dinner menu is small and allows the chefs to focus on each dish's perfection. The ingredients are locally sourced and rich in flavor. The dishes are advertised as shareable which encourages conversation and will leave you satisfied without feeling \"stuffed\". Try the dog friendly patio while it's nice outside, and sit by the fire with your furry friend!"}
{"text":"My review of 3 stars is really about their gender neutral bathroom in the restaurant.  

We had a girls birthday luncheon in the main restaurant.  Staffs were very friendly, menu is limited but selective.  Brunch food was tasty, portion is a bit small, however, overall was perfect for girls luncheon.   I find the gender neutral bathroom very uncomfortable with every stall marked W/M.  Centralized sinks in the middle of the bathroom which men and women could be washing their hands, putting their powder next to each other.  Total lack of privacy!!!!  

The property is beautiful but the condo construction next to the hotel is taken away the beauty of this hotel.  I hope all will improve soon.  I most likely will not return but wish Hyatt the best!"}
{"text":"I don't recall ever writing a Yelp review before but my recent stay at Andaz has inspired me to give it a shot. Everything about our stay was better than expected: the restaurant on the grounds was wonderful, especially for breakfast; wifi connectivity throughout the grounds was excellent; the gym was, though a bit small, first class and perfect for my needs; the pool was always busy (but not uncomfortably crowded, even though the hotel was at full capacity on the Saturday of our trip).  

The staff was always friendly and helpful and, now that I think about it, always seemed to be in a good mood). 

Anyways, as I mentioned at the start, even though I am a frequent Yelp user, I do not write reviews.  In this case, I thought I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't share my wonderful experience. 

I hope that this encourages you to give the property a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stayed here for about a week when visiting Scottsdale.

Pros:
-rooms are private little bungalows and are pretty spacious
-decorated really cute
-nice large showers
-free ride in Tesla to anything within 5 miles between the hours of 7AM and 7PM
-nice pool area with free drinks around 11:30

Cons:
-rooms are super dark
-our room had very dirty stained carpet
-stained bed sheets
-house keeping left a large bag of trash in our room
-we weren't really fond of the in-room dining options
-little red bugs everywhere in bathroom (we think they were clover mites)
-food is very over priced
-location is kind of hidden and difficult for Uber drivers to find

Also, all of the staff are very young - not sure if this is good or bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic property with stunning views of Camelback mountain! 

This Andaz stays true to the brand, with excellent amenities and top notch customer service. Since we stayed in low season and this hotel was brand new they were gracious enough to upgrade us to the most fabulous Presidential suite! It was really amazing, perfect for a honeymoon, family vacation or 2 couples sharing a golf vacation. 

I highly recommend this property! I will return soon for another fabulous stay!"}
{"text":"We loved our stay at the Andaz! It was so relaxing, fun and everything we ate or drank was delicious! You can tell the employees really enjoy working here as we did not encounter one bad attitude. 

The grounds are beautiful, our room was amazing (XL king), and the design is modern and fun.

We cannot wait to get back there and are even considering having our wedding here! 

My only complaint is the bed mattress was a bit firm for my liking."}
{"text":"This is a new resort with HUGE potential.  It's not quite fully there yet, but I think in a couple years it will be very well established with trendy Scottsdale vacation-goers.

First the pros:

-- Awesome casitas with modern décor, huge flat screen TVs, great amenities, free drinks/snacks (non alcoholic), comfortable beds
-- Nice resort \"campus\" with reasonable views of Camelback and modern architecture
-- Service (with one exception below) is excellent with most staff going above and beyond and wearing multiple hats
-- Terrific spa with its own pool, wine, delicious spa snacks, and amazing service. Great promotions in the summer
-- Food at the main restaurant is really good especially brunch
-- The bartender at the pool is awesome!
-- Great music at the pool on weekends
-- They will drive you in a golf cart to nearby shops/restaurants and during the day in a Tesla a bit further
-- They were super flexible about early check-ins/late check-outs and also addressing immediately any issues that we had
-- There were tons of free drinks e.g. breakfast Bloody Mary shots, sangria by the pool, etc.
-- Good gym on site

The cons:

-- The pool is pretty small for such a large resort and I imagine it is too crowded on busy weekends/times of year
-- Service at the pool was really understaffed. We rented a cabana and for a good portion of the day no one came to check on us or remove food/bring towels, etc.  (Later in the day a supervisor came to pitch in and help out so I know they were trying, just were really understaffed)
-- Food at the pool wasn't great (much much better at the main restaurant)
-- We initially had some issue with bugs in our room (including crickets). They fixed the door frame which had a gap (probably a new construction issue) and addressed it quickly.

Overall, I can tell they are really trying hard and we met so many amazing staffers at the resort.  They resolved any issues we had with a smile and quickly.   I think they are just working out some new resort/opening issues!"}
{"text":"We took shelter at the Andaz from hurricane Irma. Best decision ever. Thanks to the amazing staff, we were able to relax for a week in this gorgeous oasis. We felt so pampered at breakfast and the gorgeous pool with Camelback mountain view. The casitas are very roomy, mid century modern decor. Mini bar well stocked; if you need a ride, they have Tesla service to take you around town. We hope to be back soon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the pro: AMAZING service from all staff!! 
However, the cons outweigh the one pro, as room cleanliness and comfort is most important to us. 

The room was dusty, my allergies were bad upon entering the room. The AC didn't work well, it didn't get very cold or down to the temp it says. I called and told the receptionist and he advised to put the temp on the snowflake which it was on already, didn't help.

We didn't sleep much both nights just tossed and turned most of the night. The beds felt hard and the pillows were either super flat down pillows or super thick and not down pillows, no in between. 

I asked for different pillows but they provided similar ones. Also, for a king bed, they only have queen pillows so they are super small doesn't make sense. 

I have neck problems as it is, so need pillows that are medium thickness as most people probably prefer. We were tired most of our trip since we slept horribly :/"}
{"text":"Relaxing resort with amazing hand crafted cocktails and an innovative menu. However, I am giving it 2 stars for the gender neutral bathroom. DISGUSTING!! There is no sound privacy barrier in the bathroom which makes it super awkward. Let's be honest, it's awkward enough in an all women's bathroom. Ugh.
Why why why???!!!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday weekend at the resort... what an unforgettable experience.  The room, the food, the staff... exceptional service!  A special thank you to the front desk All Star Shawna Kim... she truly is the reason why I am writing this review.  #giveheraraise"}
{"text":"Lovely day at The Andaz Resort. The staff is incredibly hospitable, Austin went out of his way to accommodate our needs and everyone else made us feel so warm and welcome. I highly recommend this place for a relaxing day by the pool and the best service in town!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Spent four days here this past week and was treated like a King!

The staff is everywhere you look and quick to meet all your needs. From greeting you with a glass of wine upon arrival to making sure your room is sparkling every time you return... they've mastered the art of excellent customer service.

The pool is beautiful - many places to relax and a full bar. The bungalows are roomy, tastefully decorated and quite comfortable.

Meeting rooms / public areas are readily available. 

I've traveled many places... never have I witnessed such a large staff that cleans every-single-inch of a property, every-single-day... The absolute cleanest place I've ever stayed!"}
{"text":"This message is coming from someone that takes there hotel and services seriously!   I would like to inform anyone that is thinking of staying here to \"please do it\".  It was one of the best I have stayed at in a long time.  \"Elise\" and the others at the front desk made it a breeze to help out whenever needed and any questions asked, they always had an answer!  The food was great and make sure u see \"mike\" with the pony tail at the bar, he knows what he's doing and he knows how to stir it up. Take advantage of the happy hour specials!  Pool is unreal and the the whole lot itself is well groomed!   Me and my girl will be back!!! Ps the rooms kept you cool in the hot days and nights!!"}
{"text":"This new property is incredible.  Love this Andaz brand!!  Bravo Hyatt!  The staff, food, rooms, pool area, lobby.... everything is fabulous.  The girls (hosts) at the lobby are so pleasant and ready to help your stay be exceptional.  
It is classy but not stuffy.  Understated luxury at its best.  I love the lights in the trees.
Was here for a meeting and the meeting team: Peach, Thea, Sue and the rest of their team rock it!  Our group had a great meeting here, flawless (and had one of the best BQT lunches I've ever had!) - we'll be back!  
Thank you Andaz Scottsdale Resort & Spa.  Keep up the great work!

{"text":"Stayed at Andaz for four nights over Memorial Day weekend. It is hard to imagine anyone rating this property anything less than five stars. It's pretty magical here.

First, let me address the elephant in the Yelp room: The gender neutral bathrooms.

These bathrooms are located between the restaurant and reception. I do not know why they have gained so much negative attention from prior Yelpers. Some Yelpers have alluded that these bathrooms are risky/scary. One Yelper even called these bathrooms \"DISGUSTING!\" These people need to go find a cabin in the woods and remain their for the rest of their lives because clearly they are unable to adapt to changing times nor can appreciate exceptional design.

The bathroom area is a big open space. There are shared sinks in the middle and 7 toilet stalls positions along the walls. The toilet stalls have floor-to-ceiling doors. I call these \"poop-able\" stalls for obvious reasons. I cannot follow the logic of any negative comment directed toward this bathroom. To give this resort a three-star rating because of these bathrooms is unfathomable in my opinion.

Second, let me address a service the hotel provides that no one has mentioned: Tesla service.

That's right. Tesla service. Andaz has a Tesla and they will give you a complimentary ride in said Tesla to any location within a five mile radius. Tesla service is first come, first serve and runs from 7am to 7pm. I believe we used Tesla service more times during our stay than the Tesla service has been used collectively since the resort opened. It's fabulous. We were known to the drivers as \"regulars\". I felt like a baller when Tesla service dropped us off in front of a brunch joint with 35 people waiting outside for a table.

Third, not all casitas are created equal.

As with any hotel, some rooms are better than others. We resided in 5E which faced the parking lot and the new apartment complex being constructed (all exterior work is complete, so no more construction noise as previously noted by a Yelper). Our casita was also far from the pool. I'd say it was possibly the third worst positioned casita but that was OK because we spent all our time at the pool. There are very few casitas with views of Camelback. I actually did not see Camelback from the property until the end of our second day.

Fourth, the pool. 

Overall, it could be bigger. Sunday of Memorial weekend was extremely busy. There were not enough chairs, not enough space in the pool, not enough umbrellas, not enough anything. I believe that day was a learning experience for the resort. 

Also, for views of Camelback at the pool, snag a chair near the cabanas closest to the restaurant. Those chairs are positioned best for the views and the sun.

Fifth, environmental consciousness, or lack thereof.

The resort provides two complimentary bottles of water daily. Inscribed on the plastic bottle is this: \"At Andaz Scottsdale we have selected Private Spring Water as en environmentally conscious partner who uses 100% recycled plastic and sustainable practices to lower their carbon footprint.\"

That's great! Except there isn't a single recycling bin on the property! There is no way to recycle these bottles nor the plastic water cups at the pool, nor beverage cans, nor liquor bottles. The resort really has failed in this respect and I've emailed the resort directly requesting they provide recycling bins on the property/in the rooms.

Last but not least, BYOB at the pool. All I can say is that there is no rule against BYOB, however, I do not recommend blazing into the pool with a glass bottle of Tito's like one guest did. Not only did I find this move trashy but glass is not allowed in the pool area and someone should have called her on it. If you choose to BYOB (and by this I mean mix drinks in your room and bring them to the pool), be a little discrete out of respect for the pool servers. Don't be a jerk and show up with a cooler of Coors Light. The servers want your tips and when you BYOB, those tips go away and they know it so there is no need to throw your BYOB in their face."}
{"text":"ANDAZ in Scottsdale is one of my new favorite resorts. No wonder why they were featured on the Conde Nast Travelers hot list for 2017. They are all about customer service with a local trendy and chic vibe. This location is great as it is close to the best shopping and nightlife in the city. As we were arrived, there were bell hop's on the curb anticipating our arrival and ready to offer their help. They had me leave my bags and my car running and head in to complete check in. A woman brought over an iPad, which she used to check me in and offered me a complimentary drink. When entering our room, on the dresser, the staff left a note wishing my friend a happy birthday and a surprise bottle of champagne. There was also a note on a tray stating that snacks were on them, as well as all non alcoholic beverages in the mini fridge. The Andaz does offer free Valet and self parking, however the way that the resort is laid out, as well as the particular location of our room made it most convenient to drive myself to the building where we were staying and park my car in the small parking lot near our room. After checking out the room, my friends and I cracked open the champagne and got ready for our massages. We walked over to the Palo Verde Spa and were warmly greeted by a receptionist who showed us our locker. We put on our robes and waited in the lux waiting area for our therapists. While we waited, they had pastries, mixed nuts and fruit to snack on, and plenty of fresh water. My therapist introduced me to the essential oil options and let me know which one she recommended. The table linens were high quality and the table was warmed from underneath. The therapist was an obvious pro, working all my knots out without causing any discomfort. Afterwards, we met in the private outdoor hot tub where we soaked and chatted about how great our massages were. We got ready for the evening and walked to the onsite bar Weft and Warf. There we all sat at the bar and made friends with the bartender and staff. We shared the Bond burger - bleu cheese, bacon and pickled red onion on a Brioche Bun. It was pretty tasty! We ubered to Old Town to celebrate my friends birthday and had a blast bar hopping there. We came back to the hotel around 1 am and headed to the pool, which is technically closed at this time but we were still able to jump in. The staff came and told us to quiet down and that the pool was closed but they would let us stay if we were quiet. Turns out there were a few too many of us and we couldn't keep the noise down enough, so ultimately we had to leave. The staff was very gracious and kind and we headed back to the room. At the room we decided we wanted a snack and called room service. In what seemed like lightning speed, we had a chicken wrap with chips and a plate of chocolate covered pretzels! The next morning, we went back to the restaurant bar and had brunch. We all had the dirty hash browns which were amazing with our Bloody Mary's! The hash browns were cooked to perfection and combined with the savory Green Chile Pork, mouth watering Queso and topped off with the perfect fried egg. We also ordered the Waffles and Raspberries with fresh made cream and a Mimo. Fresh made cream is one of my favorite things, however the waffles had a very distinct eggy flavor. They weren't bad but they were different. Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Hyatt's new Andaz in Scottsdale and it was their style, staff, and close attention to detail that made the weekend perfection!

{"text":"Just had an epic stay at The Andaz. The food and beverage manager, the talented Aaron is a totally professional and incredibly sweet. His two best servers, Jordan and Noel were on top of everything. We had everything we needed. From the sunny yellow towels to the special bracelets all he staff wear, every detail in this hotel is on point. 

We upgraded to a larger room (18A) it was gorgeous and we loved the private patio and double shower. We got a late checkout (I mean really late) with no extra charge (it's Monday right now). 

Loved this place. Can't wait to return."}

{"text":"Loved staying here, very  luxurious. Great hospitality. Food was amazing and close to other restaurants. Will stay here again for sure. Rooms were very clean, bathroom was amazing. Decor in room was fabulous."}
{"text":"Not often do I give out 5 stars but this place goes out of there way to please you, after a abrupt end to my Rocky Point stay in Mexico 2 days ago (dropped cell in Ocean) not smart I know. Wanted to continue my vacation in this Region, so found this gem to take gf, and was not disappointed so many free items and great customer service food was exceptional! Maybe little expensive but balanced out by the complimentary items given, the late late checkout, and the accommodating staff. There was A  wedding on grounds that hosted a few  NFL players and NBA players so tells you the reputation of this place you will not be disappointed.. very reasonable rate for the summer months check it out.

Sister property to Gainey Ranch(Hyatt) my personnel fav in Az can't say enough about the staff from the Valets, to the receptionist/Res.. to the the wait staff, to the staff at the pool all were very professional and had the best attitudes 1 st class all the way around."}
