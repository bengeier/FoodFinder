{"text":"This is impressively tasteless. I adore Chinese food but this place is really unacceptable, not even mediocre."}
{"text":"Transplant from the northeast. Tried the General Tso's, sauce was more like teriyaki and chicken was overcooked. My 11 year old loves Chinese and I got this at 7 pm so he was pretty hungry, had about 3 bites and was done. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Greasy fast Chinese food results in upset stomach every time we have been there. Steer clear of this place when looking for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I stop in for lunch every now and then and the food is about what you'd expect from your average Chinese take-out restaurant. However, if you ever walk through the door, planning to eat inside, and see a little Asian child running around in there, then do yourself a favor and leave immediately. This child belongs to one of the workers/owners and screams constantly. No crying, mind you, but screaming at the top of his lungs while trying to converse with his mother. The mom occasionally tries to quiet this child, but he doesn't listen to her at all. After a while, she ends up yelling just as loud as him. This has happened twice while I've been there and I won't eat there again if I see that kid inside."}
{"text":"We used to order the sesame chicken regularly since they are close and great price. Sadly, since the change in ownership, the food quality had gone down and isn't nearly as good. After 2 or 3 disappointing meals, we opt for Red Bowl or Ming Fu."}
{"text":"Average Chinese food.  Don't drive too far to get there."}
{"text":"I usually do not post reviews but my family has been ordering from chia best for 15 years and while it has never been great, it was always alright/cheap. Tonight we debates between red bowl and chia best but decided to order from chia best because it is closer and cheaper. The past year has been terrible, there was a change in ownership and it shows. The food is bland, the garlic sauce doesn't even have flavor. The orange chicken we ordered was extremely tough and did not taste freshly made. But the real reason I was pushed to write the review is that I ordered 4 vegetable spring rolls, got home bit into one and it was in fact 4 shrimp rolls not veg spring rolls. I do not eat any seafood at all and never have. When I called them back the response was \"oh yeah the company we buy them from made a mistake with the order so we only have shrimp rolls no spring rolls so we have been giving everyone the shrimp rolls if they order spring since that's what we have\" I have worked in restaurants for years, I understand if the food company made a mistake and they didn't have them- BUT TELL ME THAT WHEN I ORDER IT. Don't assume that I will be fine with shrimp rolls!!! People could be allergic and order what they think is a veggie roll and have a bad reaction! She said I could bring them all back and exchange them for egg rolls...well I am not going to waste my time and gas bring anything back when it was your mistake and I have already trashed them and lastly given the option between a shrimp or pork roll when I had first ordered I would've told you no shrimp! 

Spend the extra $5-10 and go to Red Bowl down the road. Better service and better food."}
{"text":"This place is so close and convenient to my home, that my family keeps going back, after the quality of the food has gone down drastically in the last few years.  I didn't know that the restaurant was sold a few years back, but this coincides with the decline of this neighborhood take-out place.  The dumplings are thick and doughy.  The fried rice seems just overloaded with soy sauce, and virtually no other flavors.  I don't expect the world with fast take-out Chinese food, but it seems like you would have to try to make food this bland.  Maybe we're just ordering the wrong thing, but I don't think other things would be better.  Miss the old ownership, and wish there were other choices nearby."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  It was so bad that both my teenage son and I decided to throw our meals out.  This is really saying something because we will usually power through a bad meal just to not be wasteful.  I can't express with words how absolutely horrible our meals were.  General Tso chicken ( put into the garbage), chicken lo mein (in the garbage), spring rolls (starving so we ate them but they were really bad), egg rolls (ate one and threw one away), and steamed dumplings (the least terrible item, but still give it a yuck.)"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not the best I've ever had but not the worst either.  Would order out again."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to write this but this summer my favorite Chinese hole in the wall for the past 13 years has been sold and after giving it 3 tries I have to say it's just not the same.  Not even close.   We have tried all about old favs and they are only half as good as prior.  Soooo bummed!  

If you know of any place I should go between Waxhaw and Matthews please let me know."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food we've ever had. I hate myself for wasting the calories on bland flavor, mushy \"meat\", and underfilled crab rangoons (wontons). If I can save just one person from this food, it's all been worth it."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and wanted to try them because they're so close to my house and cheaper than other options nearby. I had the crab rangoons, which were flavorless as well as the sweet & sour sauce. The potstickers/dumplings were very thick and doughy, the meat inside was not good at all so I couldn't even finish eating these. I ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce for my main dish, which luckily I checked before I left the restaurant because they forgot to give me rice. The tiny portion of rice I received is not near enough for my entree. I have had shrimp with garlic sauce from many different restaurants and this was the worst yet. Most of the dish consists of shredded celery, very few other vegetables and very small shrimp. There is very little flavor as well. I was very disappointed in this restaurant and will not be going back. I'd rather spend a little more to be able to eat my food."}
{"text":"Their chicken fried rice is as good as anyone's, but when I tried real dishes (I tried Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Shrimp), they are pretty bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Solid $4.99 lunch special. You get exactly what you expect from a takeout chinese joint, a satisfying cheap meal of hot and saucy bits and a gosh darn decent spring roll. They even give you a drink with that deal. Crazy cheap and quite tasty.

There was an uppity white lady in there ordering after I ordered (hey, this is relevant to the review, stick with me). Anyway, she kept trying to order fried vegetables, no sauce. As in, 'just oil' I guess. But they don't do that, it's white sauce or steamed. They were very clear and patient with her, their English was great. I got it, she seemed smart enough to get it. But she was clearly rich and entitled and very impatient. Anyway, she finally gave up and left as I was leaving, then she went to Subway. The point being -- are really nice folks here, so don't act like an entitled meanyface. Order what's on the menu or go somewhere else. Who creates static with someone who's about to prepare your food? A dummy that's who.

Her loss, the food is great, and their awesome patience bumped this from a four star to a five star."}
{"text":"For the price this is good fast Chinese food. We have tried it many times before and it was awful, seems the new owners have made the food edible. If you are looking for sit down this is not he place, but friendly service fast and nice people."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I've ever had. The chicken had no taste and be rice looked like one of those disgusting bags you can buy at the grocery store. Spend $1 more and drive across the street to redbowl."}
{"text":"I was in the area to see friends perform at an event in the same strip mall and decided I would eat there.   This place needs to close down.  It is not at all what I expected.... The pork in the food was all strips of disgusting fat and the fried rice had absolutely no flavor even after I tried flooding it with soy sauce and sweet sauce.  The so called fried scallops were simply mystery meet.  I was so disappointed.. Please don't eat there. save your money... these people are just there to make a buck or 2 and you can get better flavor from your grocers frozen food section."}
{"text":"Awful chinese food.  There are so many better places around south Charlotte than this sad excuse of a restaurant.  The food is tasteless, service is crappy, restaurant is dirty.  Please do yourself a favor and skip."}
{"text":"We've been getting take-out food here for two years.  Our meal tonight was good and reasonably priced.  Reading the other reviews, it sounds like the place is terrible, but it's not. We like it most of the time and they seem to always be busy.  The place has tables to eat in, but ambiance is that of a take-out place. 

They have really good egg drop soup with lots of flavor. My kids like the orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  Husband usually gets General Tso's chicken. Chicken with garlic sauce and chicken with vegetables are both good options, but you may want to ask for spicy for more flavor. The fried rice doesn't have much flavor, so we skip it and get white rice. We like the spring rolls better than egg rolls. 

It's take-out Chinese food from a family-owned business. The owners cook and their kids work the front with the little kids entertaining themselves on iPads in the dining area. It's decent food, cheap, and usually fast.  

The lunch and dinner meals are a good deal. Entree, choice of rice, and spring or egg roll for $5.99+."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and have never had a bad meal (as some reviewers lament). My family loves the chicken and broccoli. Consistently very good. Same goes for the spring rolls. And you can't beat the price for lunch. It fast food Chinese and admittedly not very fancy inside, but it's good food."}
