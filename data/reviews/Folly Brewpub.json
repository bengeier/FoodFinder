{"text":"Great beer, amazing food, and wonderful people (oh, and they have a small patio).

I like to sit at the bar and learn more about the beers - made in house - which are changing all the time. 

The food is fresh and expertly made by the co-owner chef.  We have fully enjoyed everything we have had here."}
{"text":"Agreed with the other reviewer. Lots of potential, but not great yet. 

Beers were great. We tried multiple types of Foley Brewing varieties and all were different but good in their own way, especially Inkhorn and Flemish Cap. 

Food was good, but small portions. Warning on the nachos: it's only 4 chips with lots of lettuce. It was good, just unexpected. Wings were good, but the plate came with only four. Poutine was also good, but small portion and didn't use cheese curds. 

Service was a little strange. One server was good. One other girl came around occasionally without an introduction. I'm not sure if they worked as a team or if they got their tables confused. 

Music: not good. Clearly one (short) playlist was on repeat. We heard the same 60-minute song set 2-3 times. It's not that difficult to get a longer playlist from Songza. 

Overall: They have a couple easy improvements to make. Lots of potential given the great beer and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Usually I'm a bit cheap when it comes to high prices and relatively low portions, but this place is worth it. The beers are fantastic by themselves but the food is the main reason to visit. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I wished I lived here so I could be a regular. This place is incredible!! The whisky selection is second to none!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and a snack. Beer selection was oddly short for a brewpub. You had to walk over to the chalkboard to see the beer selection. Small food menu as well, but everything sounded tempting. The place was very spacious; it was nice not to feel crowded.

I had fish tacos and they were pretty good. The pickled cabbage with jalapeno and cilantro gave a nice kick to the mellow, crispy fish. Service was OK.

Protip: The restrooms are at the front of the restaurant, not the back!"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to check Folly out for sometime and considering that it is right across the street from the YMCA where we go all the time, a miracle we haven't been here before. It was a rainy Sunday night and so there was almost no one there but we really enjoyed the beers we sampled. I had a farmhouse IPA which was a really perfect combo of slightly sour, slightly frothy, and hoppy floral. My companion had a dark saison with cardamon which was subtly spicy and rich. Although the saisons we are getting here in Ontario are not as big on flavour as the ones we got used to drinking at places like Benelux in Montreal, this was a tasty treat. We will definitely be back from more beverages and perhaps try some of the food, which looks to be pretty good."}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of Folly Brewpub until very recently. Having been to many other breweries around town, I was a little surprised by some of their rules, and that's the main reason for the 3 stars. 

- They only do one flight and it consists of their 4 classic beers. No substitutions! Which is fine if it's your first time at Folly, but if you want to try any of their unique/seasonal brews you have to order a full pint. This seems to be a recent change based on the previous yelp photos. Although they no longer have the \"no flights on weekends\" rule. 

- They don't do half pints! It's absurd to me that at a brewpub, there seems to be no way to \"sample\" some of the drinks. They might give you a little sample to try before ordering a pint, if you ask.... (I don't know, I didn't ask). Most pints are 16 oz ($7.50), and the flight (4 x 5oz) is $12. 

Samples aside, I thought the beers were really good. I had the tasting flight of their classics, and the sour with guava. The guava was a bit strong for my taste, and I would have liked a half pint of that one, instead of a full 16 oz. The food was also very good. I shared the mac and Cheese and Fish tacos with my friend. It seems they change their menu often (based on Yelp photos), which is nice, since the menu is smaller than most restaurants. Although it seems they've expanded quite a bit over time. I think it's a great neighbourhood pub with good food, nice selection of beers (especially if you already know what you like there) and live music!"}
{"text":"Under rated gem, best burger I've had in a long time. Good variety of starters everything is terrific, my wife and daughter had the fish tacos and of course the brew is top notch. When I go out I want food and drink I would make at home. I give this brew pub an above average rating!"}
{"text":"Excellent Brew pub!! Great tasting and creative craft beers. The most extensive whiskey, scotch, bourbon list you can find in Toronto... and the food, oh the food. Everything on the menu is super tasty and fresh. This is a must do any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Back in February, Folly Brewpub participated  I actually didn't even know this place existed until they were listed as one of the places with a special poutine for La Poutine Week.

They had a duck confit poutine with crispy onions, au jus and herby cheese curds with seasoned fries and it was by far one of the best ones I had that week. Actually, I was really glad we made the trek there, except, as soon as we walked in, we were given attitude. Sure, I walked into a pub with my Starbucks cup, the first thing the server said instead of greeting us was \"You cannot bring that in.\" followed by a not pleasant look. It wasn't, \"Hey, how's it going?\", or even \"table of three?\" Whatever, I let that slide because I really wanted to try the poutine.

We ordered one to share as we did for the previous three locations, she seemed disappointed we only ordered one. One of my friends enjoyed it so much, she decided to order one to take home for her husband, except, they don't do take out. Not that they don't allow take out, but they simply did not have containers that could contain the poutine.

The place looks pretty cool, I guess I'll come back again eventually."}
{"text":"Really digging this place. I see a lot of potential and hope it does well. Folly Brewpub is withing the building that used to be \"Habits Gastropub\" and I must say that I'm much more enthused by what Folly is doing. Interior is a long bar at the front, a big communal style table, and then hightop 4 seaters for the stretch alongside the open kitchen, and finally more standard tables in the back close to their brewing rooms. Lots of exposed brick and beam and well accented decor, this place has a good vibe about it.

I love beer sampling and this place offers flights of four 5oz glasses, each 5oz glass ranging in the $2.5-$3 range. Pints are $7.5 on average. I tried about 6 different beers and really like most of what I drank. Really enjoyed the \"Rhizome: Mosaic/Calypso\" hoppy farmhouse ale specifically, but none were bad and each had their own flavours and appeal. 
On the food tip, their charcuterie meat board was well prepared and the chicken and waffles rather tasty as well. I especially liked how the chicken was boneless and the chicken to waffle ratio was big enough for equal fork filling parts of meat and waffle, making it good for sharing.

Service left a bit of something to be desired, and they had live music going on which normally is a plus but in this case was not... There were multiple people performing and the sound would go from a decent level to distractingly loud as the artists changed. I'm sure they'll learn to actually manage the sound better with more events, and not snub customers as time progresses as well, and at that point I can see this place being a proper 5 stars."}
{"text":"Folly Brewpub is a gem. Their beer is delicious and inventive, service is friendly and atmosphere is welcoming. Drinking their dark sour as I type this and I'm so happy."}
{"text":"Folly makes the most amazing beer in Toronto (seriously like knock your socks off amazing beer!) I am probably here once a week. They're always brewing up something creative using great hop combinations and interesting and innovative flavours. The staff is always so lovely and the food is super tasty and easy to share. I cannot recommend this place enough!!"}
{"text":"Cozy bar that my husband and I stumbled upon. Had the best of both worlds here, a tv with the Jay's game on and amazing food."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3.5 if I could.  The food was actually very good - fish tacos and fries.  But the beer flight was very limited - couldn't pick what you wanted from menu.   In general, the beer was surprisingly sour for their styles - not sure if that's intentional or a more serious problem.  The service was a bit lacking as I felt as if I were bothering them by asking for menus, beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Folly last night and absolutely loved it. We had 2 appetizers (chorizo & pulled pork tostadas) both of which were really, really tasty. My husband had the fish and chips and gobbled them up so, so, so fast. I had the olive oil poached whitefish tacos and they were outstanding. The chef/owner cooks fish exceptionally well.

The service was amazing. The beers are also top quality, the brew masters are from NFLD and have worked really hard at tweaking the beers to make them just right.

The interior is cozy and even though it's mostly high-top tables all the stools have backs so they're comfortable. 

I will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Great beer, all farmhouse. Worthwhile for a pint or a whole night. Whiskey selection among the best. Got to love some pappy!"}
{"text":"This is a decent little place on Collage that serves a limited menu with a limited menu of drinks. Service was average and nothing bad to report."}
{"text":"How awesome is this place?  Great for weekend day time drinking. Amazing knowledgable service and neat beer.  We didn't eat, but did have 11 of the 12 in house brews. The raspberry smile and inkhouse were my favourites and i like sourish things.  Not cheap, but amazing. And the staff know the area and can direct you to obscure retail locations. We will be back.  Best beer in the area. Don't let roadwork keep you away.  And pick up a couple of bottles from the bottleshop for later.  No attitude,  no fooling, just some great beers."}
{"text":"Folly Brewpub opened in October.  It hit our radars a couple weeks ago and Gord and I checked it out this evening for supper.

They brew their beer onsite.  I had a  Flemish Cap and found it a bit too sour ... Gord liked it.  I liked the Colinet better.

Gord ordered the Cod Fish Cakes and enjoyed them.  He'd get them again.  I had the Braised Capon chicken wings.  They were good.  Gord also ordered the Stovetop Mac & Cheese and said he'd order it again.  I ordered Chicken and Waffles.  It was good and I'd get it again.

James was our server and he took excellent care of us.

We had a great chat with Michelle, the manager.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband says \"this place is pretty epic.\"  There is good beer, good food,  good tunes, good atmosphere, great, friendly service and a great vibe. 

We enjoyed 4 different beers and all were clean and flavorful, not bland,  3.5 to 4.25 out of 5 stars across them. We tried the Flaming Choriço, a mildly spice sausage grilled and served flambéed with moonshine table-side. Definitely an experience! The fish tacos were moist and fish loaded, not all batter and filler. And those smashed potatoes? I'd love to figure out how to make those at home. 

It's probably a good thing it's a road trip for us to get here. If we lived in the neighborhood we might be regulars. Defined glad we made the stop!"}
{"text":"Another brewpub having several own beers (between 8 to 12), decently priced I would say ($7,5 tax excl.). You can order a flight of 4 for $12, but!!! You cannot have flights on Fridays and Saturdays which led me to believe that this is rather a money hungry establishment. The burger is $15 and comes rather in a larger-than-average portion. 

I tried their Belgian brown ale which obviously was a Flemish Red Ale and their oat IPA, which had oats and some sweetness, but needs more of them. 16% of oats in the brew kettle is clearly not enough to differ from usual IPAs.

Our waitress was kind but she forgot to bring water with half of the tables empty. You can also buy their bottled beers. They are brewing biweekly new brews, especially sours. As of July 31st, a plum sour will hit the shelves. 

A good place to try new beers, but of you want to have flight go during weekdays. I'll go a couple more times to try their beers and will comment on that later. It s  3.5 stars, not 4 if you ask me"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to whisky bar for a while because of the insanely amazing Whisky Wednesdays they've had here. However since ownership changed the last owner took a lot of his prized Whisky stock with him and they're now low on most Whisky listed on the menu and the food prices have soared and changed to be more pricey then I'm comfortable paying. The beer here is absolutely worth coming for alone but I hope the new owner keeps stocking new whisky for the bar and keeping the prices modest because that's what a lot of my friends and myself come here for, not for getting rid of pub favourites and adding escargot and $20+ steak."}
{"text":"Had a great romantic evening, great ambiance, very friendly staff - chalk full of information. This is a whiskey bar with a million choices, they also brew their beer in house. Food seemed a little over priced 4 chicken wings for 9$  but we did go in for their special of the day which was 6$ mussels, which was great! I definitely will be back."}
