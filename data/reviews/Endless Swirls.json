{"text":"Conveniently located next to the Galaxy Theatre, I decided to try this place. I was craving something sweet before heading next door to the movies and this hit the spot. 

The place was very clean and the staff was really nice.  They store hours are great because they don't close too early. 

I'm crossing my fingers and hoping they add a green tea yogurt. ;)"}
{"text":"The place is clean cool and awesome different flavors that I like very nice to come to a place where your welcome and not talking to robots I recommend everyone try endless swirls locally owned not a franchise. I asked an employee I'm always curious come and try."}
{"text":"We arrived 15 mins before closing time (we hate doing), they were already closed. I called the number listed online and the phone transferred to the manager, who didn't seem frustrated the store was closed early. Instead she asked if I needed something... ummm, yes I would have liked to try your establishment. Not now. If you're going to advertise you're open till a certain time then stay open till that time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best yogurt in town.  Creamy and consistent.  Staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home, answers all your questions and offers suggestions."}
{"text":"I did NOT enjoy this frozen yogurt place. I rarely go to any other froyo places except for Yogurtland. So I decided to try something new today. 

I went for simple flavors -- sugar-free vanilla (which STILL had sugar), granola, and strawberries.

I took my first bite and cringed. The granola wasn't even granola...if you would label your toppings correctly, you would put \"Uncooked Rolled Oats\", not granola.

The best parts about my yogurt were the strawberries, which is pretty sad. The actual yogurt? It was hard to keep it down. In my opinion, it did not taste good. It tasted like lip gloss.

Overall, I wouldn't come back for more. I would rather just stick to Yogurtland."}
{"text":"Thier cash register doesnt work and this is apparently a regular thing. I had to run over to smiths because my family had already made thir yogurt. Dont go here unless you have cash."}
{"text":"On Yelp, 2 stars means \"Meh, I've experienced better\", and I have. Here, in the past.  It's disappointing because it's steadily going down hill. We've enjoyed this place over the years, but lately, it's just not there.  The stars I did give it were for the staff as they are always very nice and pleasant, but my biggest gripe is with the dwindling toppings selection (Ok, maybe budgets, maybe some don't move as much as others), and they were out of whipped cream (A staple of a toping out on a Saturday Evening?  Poor planning on the part of whoever is in charge.)  So I'll say it wasn't horrible and some of the 1 star reviews I think are pretty harsh, but in my experience, if things start going downhill at a certain business, they usually don't improve.  Will I return?  Maybe, but they won't be my go-to place anymore.  Time to see what else is out there."}
{"text":"Convenient location, great customer service. They have a wide variety of flavors and toppings. I enjoyed my experience here and I will gladly come back many times. Endless Swirls is definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"What a great party room!  We had our team party there and everything was smooth.  The staff was great and both parents and kids had a great time!  As always Endless Swirls has out done themselves,  Great flavors, variety of toppings, and as always the staff is outgoing, friendly and ready with suggestions and samples!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I would consider myself kind of a frozen yogurt expert, considering I frequented Pinkberry about 3 times a week for a year, and then moved on to Menchies and Yogurtland.  All 3 of which blow Endless Swirls out of the water.

All of the flavors I tried tasted like they had chemicals in them. I think the staff here needs to re-read the instruction manual or something.  The mix was off for sure.

Not one person in my family, including my 4 & 7 year old finished their yogurt. If two kids won't even finish it because it \"tastes weird\", then you know something's up.

The only redeeming factor was that the credit card machine would not swipe my card, and they have no way to take it manually so the nice old lady working there gave it to me for free.  

So in the end, at least the worst yogurt I've ever tasted was free!"}
{"text":"I don't think the pricing is bad. Toppings are mediocre at best. They have been out of cherries twice while I have been there. It is a great concept. I love the sea salt pretzel frozen yogurt. The young man that seems to always be there is friendly. Sometimes they have outside seating and sometimes they don't. They need to have it all the time because they keep the inside way too cold. It is in a really good location. My kids love that they can put their own sundae together. We will go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood frozen yogurt place. The owner and staff are super friendly and encourage you to try free samples. So far chocolate, strawberry, cheesecake, and kettle corn (caramel pretzel) are our favorites!"}
{"text":"They had a groupon out which gives you 4 groupons onto your account and the employees say you can only use 1 per person per day. I was there with my boyfriend and cousin, and the cashier said that's the policy. obviously... We are THREEEEEEEE PEOPLE so that's THREE customers you're displeasing. I don't know what their deal is, but they seriously need to learn how to count. The cashier said the only way I could redeem the three groupons is if they, too, and them on their phones. Oh, and they need music. The environment is awkward. And you can find yogurtland cheaper by the ounce. Never coming back again EVEN IF I still have these stupid groupons."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this establishment. I prefer this yogurt shop over the typical chain shops such as yogurtland for many reasons. In my opinion, I believe the yogurt has a creamier and richer taste. My favorite flavor is the salted carmel pretzel, but I'm also a fan of the cookies & cream and the vanilla custard. The store is always clean, the employees are extremely friendly, & it's an enjoyable atmosphere. The toppings are always fresh (fresh cut fruit, soft gummies, etc.) and there are even freshly made waffle cones and bowls. I have been in while the waffle bowls were being made, & the store smelled heavenly. The bowls are quite large but I enjoy this as I can stir my yogurt creation without my toppings spilling out the side. 

The location is perfect for a date night or family outing, as it is next to Galaxy theaters. I believe they even give you a discount if you happen to show them your movie tickets. I would even bring a large purse to the show so you can sneak some yogurt in!

Overall, I would recommend you try this place if you are a yogurt fanatic like myself."}
{"text":"Great yogurt! but pomegranate is my favorite! Boycotting till pomegranate returns! My dollar is my vote! Where's pomegranate!! We want pomegranate, We want pomegranate, We want pomegranate!!!!"}
{"text":"Yay for a fro-yo place close to home!  Yay for Endless Swirls and their yummy fro-yo!  Yay for Debbie who is wonderful, keeps the place spotless, and is full of great info -- actually, she's the coolest fro-yo person we've ever run across!  Boo for the bizarre policy wherein an employee isn't allowed to hand you a couple of tasting cups, but has to do it for you -- as in, they have to stand there and fill your tasting cup for you, etc..  It's offputting and ridiculous.  If it weren't for the tasting policy this would have been a 5 star review -- if they ever change the policy then we'll change it to 5 stars, for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Showed up on a Saturday night at 7:30 to find the door locked and a hand written note in the window saying \"Be back in 20 minutes\". Seriously?! Waited and still didn't show up. Saw at least 10 other customers come and go who didn't want to wait either."}
{"text":"Our family came here for the first time today because we had some awesome coupons. The place was clean and very nice. I noticed a mistake on my receipt and the girl that was working wasn't able to resolve it so the manager (Pam) ended up coming in within about 5 minutes  and took care of it. I was completely satisfied with how it was handled. I definitely received outstanding customer service today!"}
{"text":"Yeah Endless Swirls!!!!! I am so thrilled that they have opened. I have been anxiously awaiting on their doors to open and have been here several times. It is conveniently located right next door to Luxury + Movie Theaters.  Recommended flavors: original tart, kettle corn, chocolate custard, watermelon sorbet but all are yummy.  Owner Pam and Manager Debbie are fantastic! Come in and sample the flavors and support this independent business.   :)"}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to the Galaxy theaters the service is both prompt and delivered with a smile. They were happy to probe my tastes to figure out what I would like and offered samples before I choose one. I ended up with the candy bar smash which was spectacular."}
{"text":"Banana yogurt yummy treat!!!! $.42 per oz place is clean and next to movie theater. I should mention they  have a party room. Clean bathrooms which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I almost always love dessert, and I consider serve-your-own frozen yogurt and toppings to be a pretty good dessert overall. Endless Swirls is pretty typical on that front for friendly service, cheap prices, a clean shop, and a wide selection. However, overall, I prefer Yogurtland's yogurt flavors. Endless Swirls doesn't have any of the tart flavors, limited sugar-free, and overall more candy-centric. If the kids request it, I'll go back, but after the next movie, I'll probably try The Chocolate Moose."}
{"text":"Great location, but also bad location. We tend to get yogurt on the way out of a movie @ galaxy. Since it is just outside the theater my kids always see it and I cannot think of a reason not to get frozen yogurt. I have stopped by a few times just for yogurt. I wish they had smaller bowls for kids. My kids tend to try to fill up those bigger bowls and they they weigh it and it is expensive! Unfortunately, they don't finish it either. Such a waste. Last time I just didn't get one for myself and at their leftovers. However, I am not a fan of worms, sprinkles and cherries all mixed in so that was discusting. ha. I like staying in the restaurant, but the tables that spin are dangerous. My kids have spun their yogurt right onto the ground. The jelly belly machine is also dangerous because it is very tempting for kids to turn the levers and drop jelly belly's all over the place. It stresses me out a bit so I try to sit outside to avoid it if it is not too hot."}
{"text":"The Salted Caramel Pretzel and triple chocolate fro-yo were amazing! The place is clean and beautiful but the toppings bar was limited when I went. Luckily, I didn't need any because it was delicious"}
{"text":"A self serve frozen yogurt shop with enough options to bring me back. 

I visited on a weekday evening and the shop was clean with everything fully stocked. There were at least a dozen frozen yogurt flavors with staples like vanilla, but fun flavors like strawberry cheesecake and pistachio too. It took me a minute to narrow to three options. The candy and syrup options were plentiful. Pricing was in line with other self serve fro yo shops. The cups offered are laughably large to encourage over serving."}
{"text":"Compared to other frozen yogurt places this one is just ok. The flavors and toppings they have are typical. 
The place always smells like sewage though. Always!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Way better than Baskin Robbin which is in the same shopping plaza. I had the pumpkin pie with white chocolate chips and my husband had chocolate and cinnamon roll. We were instantly greeted by the friendly staff and one of the girls offered us to try samples. I tried the chocolate and pumpkin pie (both of which were yummy). It was hard to decide on which to get. I will definitely be back! The frozen yogurt was tasted so delish & was more flavorful than ice cream, but not overly sweet, They also have a nice selection of toppings to choose from. The price was just right. I think it was around $0.45 an ounce. It's so nice to see local places like this pop up in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place .. but that quickly went away . As soon as we walked in the door we noticed an AWFUL smell.. like someone had taken a poop right there in the middle of the yogurt store. Then I overhear both the employees saying to each other \" it smells like sh*t in here \" . We decided to get two sample cups and at least taste the yogurt, give them the benefit of doubt .. but the yogurt tasted horrible and was really runny , my husband and I both ended up just walking out without purchasing ."}
{"text":"The worst frozen yogurt ever in my life. I'm not a food complainer. I usually appreciate whatever I eat. When I spit out something immediately after I put it in my mouth, you know that it s horrible. Maybe beyond horrible.... I chose cheesecake and chocolate flavors. Cheesecake was okay. Just a cheesecake flavor. When I ate the chocolate flavor, I gagged. It was that bad.... I don't know what could go wrong but it was bad. My roommate had the basic flavor. Vanilla. She couldn't even swallow it and threw the whole thing away immediately. Please reassess your flavors... Maybe the consistency was off too. Sorry."}
{"text":"Decent little frozen yogurt spot next to galaxy theater.  They had a good selection of toppings and I really enjoyed my yogurt, but they didn't have my fave - plain tart frozen yogurt! Isn't that a staple in every frozen yogurt joint? I've seen it in every other frozen yogurt place I've been to. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed my mix of yogurts with mochi, crushed nuts and mini gummy bears."}
{"text":"Cute yogurt shop conveniently located right next to galaxy theaters. I love that they have a lot of \"popper\" topping flavors. Kiwi, Strawberry, Blueberry, & Mango.

Yummy and Great Price. :)"}
{"text":"Banana ice cream was spoilt,never thought ice cream can go bad..Every topping was really old,marmalade couldn't chew and they were out of chocolate sauce."}
{"text":"The area and service here is great but I wish they had a better variety of frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"I blame my coworkers for this...
They insisted we get ice cream after lunch, before we go back to work. A cute little shop with a super nice worker. It was clean. Even at lunch hour there was no wait. 
So they have about 5 machines, which hold 3 different flavors, 2 individual flavors, then 1 with both flavors swirled together. You can try all the flavors before you decide. 
You fill your own cup. I ended up getting Salted Carmel Pretzel, swirled orange and vanilla and swirled cheesecake and tart. They were all super good and I am not usually a fan of frozen yogurt, but this stuff is pure awesomeness.
There's a bunch of toppings to choose from, I added a couple animal crackers just because I haven't had any for a while. 
Even with my Yelp discount my ice cream cost $5, it was a good amount, I honestly think the toppings add a lot to the weight.
I work across the street so I will no doubt be back, a lot!"}
{"text":"i went a few nights ago. one young girl working. most of the toppings were almost out.and didnt look fresh. the flavor of the 2 yogarts i picked wasnt good. very bland!!! The gal was very sweet and kind. the place was clean,just the toppings werent appealing."}
{"text":"We came here looking for an easy and quick desert fix after dinner last night and used reviews on yelp to search nearby areas.

I have to say, I normally don't leave negative reviews but we were very displeased with her experience here at Endless Swirls.

The yogurt was a little runny and the toppings were very scarce and didn't seem extremely fresh.

At the time we were there, whoever was working at the front was hidden in the back office with the door closed and everybody including us waited a significant amount of time before being cashed out. 

Too bad. So sad."}
{"text":"Frozen yogurt is frozen yogurt, to the layperson.  I doubt you could tell the difference between this place and any other in town in a blind taste taste.  These guys are getting one star for a very simple reason.

I really, really, REALLY hate it when people put their marketing crap on my car while it's in a parking lot.  So you can imagine how irritating it was to come out from the movie theater and find their little 10% off cards tucked into EVERY FREAKING WINDOW of my car.  Six of them.  I'm not completely sure of what the community standards are here in regards to four letter words, so I'm just going to keep thinking them instead of typing them.

Go clean up your parking lot, Swirls.  And hire a sign-flipper or something.  It's way more eco-friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious flavors. Clean. Limited toppings, they didn't even have nuts.

Update April 11, 2018 
Drove by tonight and it is shut down. Bummer"}
{"text":"I don't know, I'm totally conflicted about the abundance of self serve fro-yo places everywhere, especially in LV. They require zero know-how and such a small capital investment (and very little continual investment), it just seems like a lazy mans business. Call me nostalgic, but where's the old ice cream shops and soda fountains?

The only bowls they have are enormous. I mean, like a pint or larger. I filled the very bottom, barely, with 10 oz and it was $5. See paragraph above-lazy mans way to make loads of money doing nothing-I mean I serve myself! Many of the flavors also said \"new flavor coming soon\" aka empty. No swirls for you!

But, these places continue to feed my bad habit of I NEED NOW ICE CREAM."}
{"text":"Great place. There is a great variety of flavors. Obsessed with the watermelon sorbet it's so flavorful. I've never had such great frozen yogurt"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmn this was a very tasty treat after seeing a good movie next door at the Galaxy Theater. I have never been here and it has been awhile since I have had fro yo. This frozen yogurt joint is cute, clean and fun! My buddy Raymond tested a bunch of flavors before making his final decision.

I sampled the chocolate peanut butter cup and cheesecake. The samples are so cute and generous and the lady employee told me I could test every single flavor if I wanted. I decided on the cheesecake and strawberry combo swirl. Mmmm it was so good and I added white chocolate chips and almond pieces.

This was an Orgasm in my mouth for sure! I could not help but moan a little with every yummy bite. 

I will be back and that is no lie!

10% off with a hash tag or check in.

Mmmm yum yes!"}
