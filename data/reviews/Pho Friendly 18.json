{"text":"Originally Pho Anise, then Pho An Vu, now Pho Friendly 18. 

Unfortunately It is not as good as other two. I tried couple of times just to make sure.  Actually got much better than how it was from the first visit. 

But the spring rolls were lacking flavour (not enough contents) and Vermicelli noodle was served hot. I thought it needs to be cooled so vegetables stay fresh.   You probably want to take some vermicelli out of the bowl before mixing, because they give you way too much for the portion."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice chill and relax event tho it's a bit hard to get into plaza (there's not a sign for the restaurant). The decor is semi modern with a hint of vintage Asian fixtures. The sever is quite nice and quite accommodating. The good thing about this place  is that most dishes are a dollar cheaper than most pho places.The service Is pretty quick food coming in about 10-15 minutes. I had the house special with the avocado smoothie it's great so flavorful. Its was so good and filling I loved every mouthful. All in all great meal and amazing deal loved it finished the soup."}
{"text":"They changed their name again. This place used to be my favourite pho place in the area but I guess not anymore. The broth is too oily and less flavourful than before. I miss the old pho broth.....Bad service as well. They got my order wrong twice. I just ended up eating the wrong order because I was in a rush. The place is still clean and nice compared to most pho places in the GTA. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I've tried in Vaughan.Good atmosphere/clean place and friendly service."}
{"text":"Pho Friendly 18 is one of the newer Vietnamese restaurants in Vaughan that replaced Pho An Vu and Pho Anise. The interior of the restaurant is spacious and clean. None of the decor has changed. For those who have never been here, it's impossible to see the restaurant from the road, so you just have to know where it is. Although this place is new, I recognized one of the staff from Lucky Bamboo in front of Vaughan Mills.

The menu is huge. One of the things that caught my eye as I was perusing through the menu is what is often referred to as Phnom Penh noodle soup, or Hu Tieu Nam Vang. It was the one thing that I missed from another Vietnamese restaurant that closed near Vaughan Mills, so I had to try it. I also ordered my go-to dish at Vietnamese restaurants, which is the grilled chicken and fried egg on rice.

The dishes were huge, so it felt like an excellent value. Make sure you come hungry. The grilled chicken was excellent. The chicken was succulent and juicy and you can taste the char on the grill marks. The fried egg was good, though a little oily and slightly overcooked. The rice was excellent, not clumpy or too soft, and went well with the sauce that comes with the dish. The vegetables were fresh. It's not the best Vietnamese grilled chicken dish I've had, but a strong contender.

The Phnom Penh noodle soup was excellent as well. I thought the broth was spot on, both delicate and rich in flavor. It definitely had the flavor that I was expecting. The noodles were tasty. I thought there was a perfect balance of noodles to other ingredients such that it wasn't too much or too little noodles. The ingredients include a quail egg, shrimp, squid, char siu pork, pork offal, fried garlic and onions, and a variety of herbs. It comes with a fried pancake of sorts with a grilled shrimp. Very crunchy and the shrimp was tasty. While it's not the best Phnom Penh noodle soup I've had, it was again a strong contender. Definitely try it if you've never had it before. It's a southern Vietnam dish that's very different than pho (northern Vietnam) and bun bo hue (central Vietnam).

I was surprised to see that they had banh xeo (pronounced banh chow in Khmer), which is another Cambodian dish that I ate while growing up. I was surprised to see that they have congee as well. I had the fish congee to go. It was very tasty and the rice was perfectly cooked. There was a good balance of rice porridge to meat. Definitely a must-try if you're craving congee.

Highly recommended. Pho Friendly 18 is on my top 2 list of Vietnamese restaurants in Vaughan."}
