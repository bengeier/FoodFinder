{"text":"Great Indian food with some regular staples! The server recommeded the Lamb Korma and Chicken Dansak, which were both delicious. We also ordered the Butter Chicken, Lamb Biryani, and Saag Paneer. We were really blown away by the Lamb Biryani and Chicken Dansak. The Butter Chicken had more coconut flavor than I am accostomed too, but still good. Overall, excellent and attentive service and good food."}
{"text":"Love this place, great authentic atmosphere. Fluffy nan bread, decent prices. Try the lamb pasanda!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian food, I am not easy to please. Stumbled  across Ganges and I am glad I did.  Great little local restaurant, been there for more than 20 years( thats what I was told).  If your looking for a classy joint, this is not the place. It looks very dated and its not the most comfortable place to sit. But the food is very good! and very well priced...Everything is cooked to order by the family that owns it and they are super friendly and accommodating ...I will absolutly go back!"}
{"text":"Not much flavour, it turns out. Semi authentic and catering to mostly western palates, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great ambience inside. I enjoyed a draft beer at the bar with some snacks while waiting for my take out food. The butter scallops were delicious."}
{"text":"For a couple that doesn't know much about Indian cuisine we have only had wonderful food and service letting the owners guide us in our menu selections.   Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. Alternate suggestions are provided below.   Imagine if Ebenezer Scrooge wanted to surprise you with some Indian food except he has some debilitating tastebud disease and his guests have bad irritable bowel. This is the typical sort of boring, middling, bland and watered down Montréal-style faux Indian food. Everything seems to be passable enough and I'm sure if this is your first time eating food with spices (other than salt and black pepper) then you'd find it palatable. Like a newborn. A newborn baby would love this food. A grizzled fifty-four year old manchild baby who takes his holidays in the faraway tropical paradise that is an Ormstown or a Chilliwack or a Napanee, and watches all thirty-one seasons of Surviver in like a weekend because spacetime bends around the vapid nature of his acultural (as in the absence of culture) being. This scenario is evocative of the blandness that is the food here.  The bread (naan with nigella seeds) was fluffy and passable while the mango lassi was also good. They had a hot and fresh gulab jamun (a syrupy rose and cardamom flavoured timbit) which made for a good sweet finish to the bland meal. These were my reasons for giving Ganges two starts instead of the lone one. I want to see more fresh flavour in everything else. We need to make a trip to the spice market at Jean-Talon. The eggplant (baigan bartha) needs to be less oily and much more piquant. The potatoes and cauliflower (aloo gobi) also could stand to have less oil and many more fresh herbs and spices (like turmeric, cumin and mustard seeds) as well as fresh ginger. Stale ingredients make for lacklustre food. The vegetable rice biryani lacked inspiration as well.  For North Indian food go to Durbar on St-Lau or Pushap on Mountain Sights or Thali on Ste-Cats. Also go to Chahat Vidéo & Variété for excellent North Indian and Pakistani street food. Anywhere along Jean-Talon between Acadie and Parc will work.   For South Indian / Tamil Sri Lankan food go to Thanjai on Van Horne or Janani on Victoria or Jolee also on Victoria."}
{"text":"I've been many times over the years and have always enjoyed my meals there.    The service is absolutely lovely, the food is consistently wonderful, charming and comfortable decor.    The stuffed paratha and onion bhaji  are my favourite starters for any meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could find an Indian restaurant that was not a disappointment. This review is based off of a takeout order, which was placed through justeat, as it was the only way to view their menu through the website.    Ordered butter chicken, which came to 16.50 after taxes. It came with a grand total of six pieces of chicken. The chicken was nicely cooked and the sauce was tasty, but I couldn't help but feel like I overpaid.  Next, we ordered an eggplant dish. I got a call saying they didn't have eggplant (on a Saturday night an hour after opening) and we got it replaced with a spinach-potato dish. This dish really didn't taste like anything. I ended up mixing it with the butter chicken. Still, disappointed to pay for a 10$ veggie dish (before taxes), to not get what we ordered, and have it replaced by something tasteless.  Last, I got two naan breads. Usually, when you order this, you get the bread wrapped in aluminum foil, or something. These breads were just shoved in a paper bag, and so when we got home, they were essentially just in doughy balls. Doughy because the bread was just undercooked - big portions of them were clearly just still dough.  Overall, the meal came out to about $35 after tax, for butter chicken, tasteless potatoes and doughy naan bread. Just a shame, honestly. Next time I'll go for maison India, the prices are slightly lower and maybe I will feel less ripped off."}
{"text":"If you're ready to wait, you won't be disappointed. Delicious food. Friendly service. A favorite go-to spot."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7, I understood the chef will need time to prepare so that all dishes can be served together, just not as long as 1h30mins I had to say. I also noticed almost every table was facing the same situation. Mango lassi tasted nice; butter chicken was my favourite. I wish I could give a higher rating since the flavour was really quite good. However I won't go back because of the ridiculously long waiting. Sorry :/"}
{"text":"Guys. Even though it's Friday night and you're sort of busy, you have to put some effort in. The saag paneer was flavourless with a only two pieces of cheese in the whole dish. The butter chicken was thin and bland. Add two previously frozen samosas and burnt naan for a total of $41 before tip? I mean, eff. You're not the only player on the block. Star of India is so so, but damn, it is steps ahead of this."}
{"text":"Traditional and home-made indian. Delivery wait time is long but worth it, although it is certainly pricey, it is hands down some of the best indian food in Montreal."}
{"text":"The best indian restaurant in Montreal. Their food is always fresh and the service is excellent. They recently had a fire in the kitchen but the restaurant is now up and running."}
{"text":"This food was ridiculously yummy. Some of the freshest and nicest tasting Indian I have ever had in my life. Not overstocked with herbs and spices and MSG. Just good flavors and ingredients.  We ordered delivery last night too, about 8pm on a Monday, the food was here in 30min. I think if they're not busy, it's much faster than what others have stated. We actually planned on giving it 1.5hrs due to other reviews and were caught by surprise.  We had samosas, pakora, chicken korma, lamb saag, rice and naan. Everything was amazing. Especially the chicken korma.  It is on the pricier side though. But if you're looking for an alternative to Bombay Mahal type places, this is one of them."}
{"text":"The food was amongst the best Indian foods in the city and the service is number one. The staff are super friendly and nice as well as efficient. Their pakoras are good as well as their lamb dishes. This is such a pleasant restaurant to go to. It ranks close second in my book amongst the 3 Indian restaurants in the area based on food and first based on the level of service. The owner and managers are such classy people."}
{"text":"I thought the restaurant was fantastic. I ordered the Lamb Madras. By accident I was given the chicken madras, but funny enough I liked it better. The restaurant of course fixed it very quickly without me bringing it up, which was very nice as I would have let it be.   The service was impeccable. I have not been to a place that catered my needs better.  I always drink a lot of water at restaurants and the waiter gave me a pitcher which he refilled."}
{"text":"Best Indian food for the price & quality in Montreal ! Everything was incredibly fresh and tasty! in other words, a fabulous experience. The staff is super nice and the atmosphere is really pleasant. I have nothing bad to say about this place, I ate there twice and both times everything was perfect."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Indian restaurants in Montreal. Even though the guys in the kitchen are not Indian but Bangladeshi (like most Indian restos in Montreal), they still manage to hit all bases. Their Butter Chicken is to die for and probably the best in the city! Beef Vindaloo, their naan bread, Shrimp curry, all of it is really tasty.  While this isn't cheap, Indian take-out, they have linen napkins here,  and you will find cheaper Indian places in Park Extension, this is a great place for serious Indian food and a proper sit-down dinner."}
{"text":"Solid Indian food. Good spices and fresh ingredients. The naan is particularly tasty. Not much ambiance, but the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Worst curry chicken i've ever tasted. It was like a soup and tasted sweet, way too expensive for the portions...$4 for naan bread."}
{"text":"Out of the 3 Indian restaurants in the area, this is definitely my favorite. Tried a bunch of their chicken dishes and all tasted amazing and unique. Their pakoras are great too. Service is friendly.  As other ppl mentioned, good food takes time so be patient!"}
