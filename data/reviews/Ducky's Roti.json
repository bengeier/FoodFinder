{"text":"Place was old looked dirty so I didn't bother ordering. I value my health so I won't eat there"}
{"text":"Not bad...In comparison to some of the other Caribbean places in Toronto their oxtail lacks flavor.  Definitely doesn't taste bad though, good place to go for a quick fix especially in this area where choices are rather scarce."}
{"text":"Went here after our usual roti place (Caribbean Queen) was closed, and so glad we did! We had the Chana roti and an app (deep fried spiced dough balls) which had an amazing dipping sauce. Hot sauce on the side which was good (but get two extras if you really like it hot!) Service was friendly, prices good, portions very very filling and the food was great, so much that this will be our new go-to roti place!"}
{"text":"Even as recently as last year Ducky's was exceptional. In the last 6 months or so it appears something has changed. Now issues with portion size, quality, freshness, order accuracy, etc.... I don't know why this has been happening but I hope it goes back to the way it used to be. I have given 3 stars, it used to be a 4 but lately has been a 2."}
{"text":"This West Indian restaurant is a local favourite in Long Branch.   I've been a customer since it opened many years ago. The food has always been fresh & tasty. Never too salty and always the right amount of pepper. and flavor!  We've had the breakfast, rotis (veg & meaty ones), rice & peas dinners, doubles etc and have always been pleased w/ the food.  The service is warm and friendly, despite how long the days may seem & how challenging it is for businesses to thrive on the Lakeshore.   I've never had any of the problems described in the other reviews.   They'd be listed on Dine Safe if they weren't suitable for eating"}
{"text":"If you like eating roting that's goat is really tough and potatoes that are a paste this is the place for you. No flavor."}
{"text":"Love the roti here.  My favorite is chicken or goat roti here.  My husband likes the shrimp roti.  Excellent doubles too. Friendly staff.  Decor is lacking but I always take-out."}
{"text":"Top notch!  Stumbled in here a few months ago.  Food - Check Service - Check Value - Check  Great customer service, authentic food.  Just go!"}
{"text":"My next door neighbour wouldn't stop raving about Ducky's Roti. He's not a Yelper but with this level of endorsement, I knew I had to give it a whirl. I've had some stellar Roti in Brampton before so my West-Indian standard were pretty high walking into this run down joint in a shady plaza near Humber College in Long Branch.  While I'm waiting to order, I find out the Ducky's has been serving roti in the neighbourhood for not 1, not 5 not 10 but 35 years. And it's ONLY a kindly older gentleman and his wife working from early morning to late at night. At 35 years you've got to have the secret to a bomb-ass roti down pat and it's gotta be good.  I ordered a jerk chicken roti, spicy for myself and a veggie special roti for my part-time vegetarian fiancee. They're made from scratch so don't expect to get your order in 30 seconds, try 20+ minutes at least, more if they're busy - but don't worry it's worth the wait.  The roti came boxed, bagged and ready to go. I asked for some extra hot sauce and the man handed my a tiny container which I kinda sneered at. He advised me not worry that this would be plenty hot for me.  Got home and tor this roti apart top to bottom, I made it my prison lover (i was inside of it, it was inside of me)... it got deliciously weird - don't judge. But then the hot sauce, dayum that shit was absolute FYAAAAA. But flavourful too! Between the silky roti, the velvety curry sauce, the tender (and abundant) jerk chicken AND the hot sauce I was super satisfied.   Hands down a top roti spot that you need to check out. Remember this place ain't pretty and you'll need to wait, but the wait is worth it.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Alas, my \"jerk chicken\" was inedible. To me, it shouldn't have even been called jerk chicken.  Mine was skinless, boneless chunks of breast meat that had been stewed in Walkerswood jerk marinade. In was pallid and brown and had never seen an open flame whatsoever.  It was served on acceptable rice n' peas but with a salad that consisted of 4 pieces of lettuce, 2 slices of cucumber and 2 slices of tomato without any dressing whatsoever.  I should have questioned what I received, but only once I returned home to write this, did I see that others have posted pictures of their jerk with whole, boned and skinned pieces.  I really did want to try the jerk here. Not sure if I did. And I don't think I'll be back to try again."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy the food here. I visit the location frequently, usually ordering the potato roti or chicken roti. The food and the spices taste great and they have a good selection of Caribbean dishes. The prices are quite cheap and the portion sizes are very good, making sure you get a good value for your dollar. I appreciate visiting a location with fast service and overall excellent customer service. They have also updated the look and image of the restaurant, making it look cleaner and more vibrant. I will certainly be visiting the restaurant again."}
{"text":"IF YOU VALUE CLEANLINESS, DO NOT EAT HERE!  So, I went there tonight with my partner to grab a couple of rotis on the way home. We ordered two Vegetarian Delights and a tall, slim guy took our order (and money) then went to the back, presumably to pass the order on to the lady who seemed to be doing the food prep.   The first indication that something might be amiss was when, a few seconds later, we could hear the beep of microwave buttons being depressed. Not a good start.  About a minute later we'd positioned ourselves at a section of the counter where we had a clear view of the stove/griddle area and we could see the woman in the back flipping a roti wrap back and forth with a wooden paddle to heat it up prior to rolling. No problem there.   THEN the guy who'd taken our order shows up next to her and starts chatting with her while simultaneously, and vigorously, scratching his neck, face and scalp! I was completely taken aback to see him doing this so close to the food, but was absolutely shocked when the woman finished heating and folding the wrap and the guy PICKED IT UP and took it off, out of sight, to another part of the kitchen! I immediately called the woman over and asked her if he was the one rolling our rotis. The response was yes, so I told her that we'd just finished watching her colleagues personal itch-fest, and that he hadn't washed his hands before handling our food. \"Oh, he washed when he came in the kitchen\", she said. I pointed out that, whether or not that was true (I doubt he washed up) he'd DEFINITELY not washed up after scratching himself all over.   Needless to say, I immediately demanded a refund, and proceeded to explain to the guy why. He seemed a tad perplexed until I put it to him that he wouldn't appreciate someone doing that if they were preparing food for him.   DISGUSTING! Dine (and I use that word loosely) at your own risk!  I wish I could give this place zero stars, and I'll definitely be calling the health department in the morning."}
{"text":"Place looks like a dump! and they do not sell Roti to other stores, place is in a dirty plaza, always empty! will never eat there!"}
{"text":"I, for some reason was craving a roti a couple weekends ago.  This almost never happens, but I was hungry and passing the area, so I gave Ducky's a go.    I walked in and I was the only one there, so service was pretty quick.I read and heard that service is slow but I had no problems.  I ordered the boneless chicken curry roti.  It was ready in less than 5 minutes.  I did agree to trini spice, I don't know why, when I usually get my doubles with slight spice.  I wasn't thinking straight, I was too hungry.  As soon as I got in my car, I dug right into it.  Omg, that trini spice nearly killed me.  I wanted to eat super fast cuz I was super hungry but it was so spicy!  I needed to drink after every bite.  If you like spice, then this is your jam.  Like i mentioned before, I only like SLIGHT spice.  That was my bad.  The hot temperature of the roti made the spice even more unbearable.  Oh and this roti was humongous, so it lasted me a lunch AND dinner.  When I came back to the roti at dinner time it was MUCH more bearable.  I was able to eat the rest no problem.    I'd have to say it was just okay.  Maybe the trini spice messed me up a bit, but it was nothing to rave about.  Good curry flavour, good chicken.  Nothing to complain about.  If you're in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Aloo pies are amazing better than any other roti shops by far.!.................................................."}
{"text":"I love this place and keep on coming back, the vegetarian roti are really tasty, decent portions and flavour! The service is always friendly, the prices aren't bad either. I really wish they would ditch the styrofoam plates already and keep the restaurant and their trays a bit cleaner, don't like the often sticky floor or table surfaces..  Takeout is best :)"}
{"text":"Really liked it on the first few times I went there. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's nothing special. I guess it depends on which day you go."}
