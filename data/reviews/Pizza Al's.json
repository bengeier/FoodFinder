{"text":"I feel like this is such a little hidden gem. They don't deliver so maybe why they are not so well known but the pizza here is excellent. Nice thin, not too thin crust baked with a perfect crunch. Perfect sauce, cheese melted perfectly. Probably in my top 2 of favorite pizza joints ever. Also, you'll probably like the prices. $8 somthjbg for a small, $10 for medium and $10.75 for a large. Can't get better than that. The guys who work here and make the pizza are also very friendly and well mannered. None of that annoying teen vibes. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"First time eating here at Pizza Al's. I have wanted to try it for a while. I have to say it was decent pizza at a decent price. There are many pizza places along Route 19, to include Italian Village, Fiori's, Harry's, Ollie's, Um Um pizza, Grande, etc. I have tried them all several times over. I guess it depends on what type of pizza your in the mood for.  The staff working there was professional and friendly. The pizza was hot and delicious. I would recommend this place and I will go back.  With that said the best pizza I have ever had was a little place tucked in a neighborhood in NJ called as Schusters Pizza. He has since passed away and the family did not carry the place on."}
{"text":"Owner called my wife a liar over a mistake they made on a previous order. They assume no responsibility even though they agreed when we called back to complain a few weeks ago.  Mediocre pizza at a low price. They have lost a senior citizen over a $10 order. Poor business in my opinion in a marketplace flooded with competitors. bye bye Al"}
{"text":"Superb pizza at an affordable price and served up by friendly people.  What more do you want?  We've been going here since they opened this location (I think their other store is in Morgantown).  It's so good, we live a few towns over and bypass every single other pizzaria to get Pizza Al's.  I have no idea what Rich D's problem is...but it appears he either went to the wrong place or is one of those reviewers who's impossible to please.  At any rate, you owe it to yourself to try Pizza Al's.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"You get more pie per square inch here than anywhere based on cost!  For $10 and almost as much real estate as Texas...Pizza Al's cannot be beat for value!!

Thin, NYC-style pizza that reminds me of just walking in and ordering by the slice on nearly ever corner...now you can't do that at Al's but you can get a lot more dough for your dough here.  Workers are very quiet, but nice and respectful.  I appreciate their kindness every time I have been there with my somewhat rowdy children that I have to beg to pipe down.

Having a kid's party?  Or throwing a party?  Or feel like being a total glutton by yourself?  Look no further than Pizza Al's for some good, quality pizza for the cost."}
{"text":"Great prices, great product, great, down to earth people. A simple recipe that works. Try this place."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza crust with good flavor to the crust and sauce. Better than almost all pizza shops in the area!"}
{"text":"I have tried pizza from a whole lot of places in the Pittsburgh area in my life. Since moving to the South Hills, I have been looking for the best out here...THIS IS IT! The pizza was perfect...Crust was on the thin side and just crispy enough at the edges to be right. Had pepperoni on most of the pie, and it was great...they use the smaller pieces, about the size of a quarter, which crisp and turn up a little bit at the edges. Sauce was just right, not to spicy and not too sweet. The pizza maker was even kind enough to honor my request for 2 slices with just black olives for my daughter. My wife, who is not nearly as much of a pizza fan as me, declares this to be GREAT! We saw some hoagies being served to another table, and agreed that we would be trying them later this week, as well. Highly recommend Pizza Al's..Good job,Guys!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just like the pizza I grew up eating at Italian pizzerias in New Jersey. 
Nice thin crust, not too much cheese, fairly priced. Wonderfully minimalist."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Almost all pizza. When I moved back to the south hills of Pittsburgh (having been spoiled by the quality and variety of food in Las Vegas), I tried several different pizzas. Pizza Al's quickly became my favorite. Minimum of once a week.

Their pizza is a thin crust, almost NY style, with a sweet and tangy sauce that doesn't overpower the flavor. They use the small pepperoni that is flavorful, again without overpowering, and the cheese is the perfect blend of just a bit gooey, and slightly chewy.

Make sure you're hungry if you order a large as it is HUGE. Great food, great staff, great prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered from pizza Al's tonight and I don't care for the pizza at all. There is hardly any sauce on the pizza and half of it is burnt. My husband says it's ok, that's why I gave two stars and not one!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good!! We also got a turkey hoagie and the bread was super fresh! Quick service and reasonable prices. The only thing I'd suggest is some music playing in the background, it would add to the overall experience."}
{"text":"It's our kids' favorite pizza now. We order a bunch for our Saturday lunches at work. Good value, good pizza.  Thought my wife would enjoy it because it's like the NY pizza she grew up with. She likes it too. Family favorite. Nice people there at Pizza Al's."}
{"text":"I recently tried Pizza Al's with my son. We ordered a large even though it was just the two of us because it was only $10! We kept it simple, plain cheese. Everything about the pizza looked and smelled perfect when it came to the table! The crust was just how I like it; thin and crispy. There is very little sauce on the pizza but that worked perfectly for me because I'm not a fan of a lot of sauce. And the cheese looked perfect. However, I was really disappointed because the pizza had very little flavor to me. I was really surprised at the lack of flavor because it looked & smelled great. My son enjoyed it though as he devoured 4 pieces!"}
{"text":"We love Pizza Al's. Pizza is large, hot and delicious and you can not beat their prices. Subs are good as well. Have never dined in, have always done take out but dining room is clean and big enough."}
{"text":"Pizza Al's is one of my favorite places to eat pizza this side of the Burgh.  I love the cheese they use and it is a huge pizza.  The price is great & you get great service."}
{"text":"It's fine. Would I come again, probably not. The pizza is a great price but overall we didn't think it had much taste. As in, no taste, it was basically tasteless. We had half pepperoni and half pepperoni/sausage. Thin crust, fresh and made right in front of your eyes. It was very busy thougj, people in and out, so I guess there are people here that love it. Happy to see  that."}
{"text":"Great pizza and customer service. My only complaint is they don't deliver. Pizza is as close to boardwalk pizza as your going to get. Big and thin! Great pepperoni. If it weren't for Fiori's being down the road this place would be all the rage. Give it a try. You won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Another good pizza shop in the McMurray area.  Stop by say hello to Albino.  Read his Italian newspaper as you wait for your order.  The shop has about 10 tables but the parking lot has less spaces so if it gets crowded you may have to use the fast food lot next door.

The crust was thin and baked to a golden brown and tasty, not sweet like a few other places.  The pepperoni in top was a little sweet though.  Al and his staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza is BIG! I got a small and it would be a large anywhere else. Staff was very polite. The pizza as others have noted had little sauce. To me... The sauce makes the pizza. The pizza itself was ok. Crust was nice and the ingredients were fresh tasting. If you need to feed a bunch of folks without spending a ton of cash....this is the place!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a pizza, ended up getting a steak hoagie and an Italian hoagie, Best bread ever, the lettuce was REALLY fresh and the flavors were great, I was pleasantly surprised that the service was also very good, free refills on the drinks . We will return."}
{"text":"Went to pick up an order for take out.  Paid.  Discovered they made the wrong type hoagie.  No problem I can wait.  They inform me I owe another $2.12 for the hoagie.  I laughed as I paid the additional $2.12 and said I found it funny they screwed up my order and are going to charge me the difference.  At this time one of the cooks made a less than nice comment.   I said whatever.   If you guys need the $2.12 that bad and don't mind making customers wait for your mistake then I'm happy to pay it. He wouldn't shut up. I walked away.  No reason arguing with a moron.   Oh and the food was sub par.  Should have stuck with Fioris rather than try someplace new."}
