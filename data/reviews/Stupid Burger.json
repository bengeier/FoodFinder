{"text":"Amazing burgers. Quality meat and toppings. A must try burger joint in Vaughan. I prefer this over burger priest."}
{"text":"Excellent burger - very good fries - decently priced!  Blows away typical fast food options and does not charge you all that much more. On par or above more high end burger places in the area and does so on a much nicer budget. I'll be back, often!"}
{"text":"The meal took a while to come in but the food was well worth the wait. I had a bacon cheeseburger which was better then most. However the real star of the meal was the chorizo poutine with chipotle mayo. It was THE BEST poutine I've ever had. The chorizo was ground up and smoked and blew my mind. I highly recommend trying this if you are a fan of poutine or chorizo."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to burgers and fries and decided to check out this place.  We went in with high expectations and those expectations were met. The menu is a la carte, so prices can add up, but it feels pretty fair for the price. This place served me one of the best burgers I've had."}
{"text":"Solid Burger place.  Placed an order for takeout for the office since it was a bit too far to drag everyone out.  Ordered 7 burgers (some specialty some not) with a variety of custom topping changes, fries and drinks.   The order was made in 15 min or maybe less, but everything was well organized into bags with everything labeled.  No mistakes on the order.  It was a bit pricey, but if you compare Stupid Burger to other \"gourmet\" burger places then it was a cheaper alternative.  The burgers tasted great and the Special burgers were all different and delicious.  The fries were great as well and not too salty.  The burgers were not greasy and not dry, but somewhere in the middle, making the experience one to remember.  Would definitely come back if I am in the area and would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries!  They use good quality ingredients and they prepare everything from scratch, but you have to wait 20 minutes.  So, they aren't \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Came with a friend, she ordered The Brazilian with an Angus patty, I ordered a Taj Mahal with a bison patty, and we shared a smoked duck poutine...so filling!  The bison burger was a touch dry but with the sauce and coleslaw it worked.  My friend was thrilled with her order and we both loved the poutine.  We added $2 for one combo and I was surprised by how small the drink that comes with it is, but other than that it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I came here 3 month ago. When I went in, they just opened for the day and the place was empty. The girl at the cashier was on the phone. I waited till she finishes her phone call. Then a man (probably the owner) in the kitchen yelled at her. \"Put down the phone, you have a customer!\" Her reply was unbelievable. \"My friend wants to talk to me!\" So it turned out I was waiting for her to finish her personal conversation with her friend. As it was lunch time, they had student combo for $5. I asked this girl if I can get it even though I am not a student. She said, \"the student combo uses different kind of cheap meat and you don't want to get it\". Sounds like she is trying to damage this business. I guess she is just an honest person? Anyways, I got a \"decent\" burger. The quality was average. The price was more expensive than I would be willing to pay.  Conclusion: 99% I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Ordered the Brazilian burger. Egg was cooked to medium runny.  Very tasty meat. Toppings were good too, didn't add anything extra. I liked the fries,  they were thick cut, but lacking the salt."}
{"text":"Tried my first burger here yesterday. It was called the Miami burger. I had the beef version. It tasted pretty damn good. I don't think I've ever had a beef burger like it. The place is small and reminded me of my high school days when we'd go out for lunch. The place is clean and the people working there are chilled out teens that'll recommend you something if you don't know what to get (like me). They have a lot of options and I'm assuming most of it must be good given the reviews this place has got. The buns aren't toasted which is something I wish I had asked for. Aside from that the topping and sauces were good. The burger was 4/5. It's sorta sloppy but trust me it's good that way!"}
{"text":"Went: 8:00 pm Sat July 18 2015 Ordered: Stupid Burger Combo with Drink and Sweet Potato Fries Cost: incl. $23.00 We split a burger and it was difficult cutting the burger in half. It is going to be messy. There were two Angus beef patties. I tried them by themselves and they were okay. On the whole, It tasted pretty much as I expected. The fried egg in a hamburger was nice, but I've seen it before. I wasn't blown away. The fries were good but besides being cut different were not that special. Customer Service: the woman behind the register did the bare minimum and gave the vibe of not wanting to be there. Bottom Line: It might be a while coming back to this place because the food is not that healthy. I also don't think what you get is worth the price. I would give it a 7/10. The person I shared it with gave it an 8 and would come back again. That averages to 7.5 or 3.75 stars, so I guess that is 4 Stars. I probably would not come back and would prefer to try other different burger places."}
{"text":"A must try!! The patties are sooooo fresh and tasty! ... I personally prefer the angus beef over the bison but both are awesome. Huge portion, excellent quality, and so reasonably priced! Also try the duck poutine!!! It's a must!!  The service is impeccable and the super awesome staff just adds to the already amazing experience.  Consistency is key at stupid burger! Both with the quality of their food and their customer service!"}
{"text":"I am very displeased with the service Stupid Burger has been putting out lately and I have been a regular customer since it opened but now am questioning the worth and value of my loyalty since the new ownership .  I have twice in the past asked for a Kobe Beef burger and have always been told that they are out. I see no purpose in offering something on your menu that you never seem to have or have enough of. Another time I ordered in advance and was told the food would be ready In 15 min . I arrived on time and had to wait 25 min. The girl apologized and said they got behind which is understandable, she then processed my payment and the debit machine wasn't working and I was forced to leave to go get cash. By then my order was ready and now sitting under a hot lamp. Essentially took 1 hour to get a burger that I was told would be 15 min. Today I called the phone line approx 6 times in 5 minute intervals and nobody answered the phone . Assuming the place was either closed or busy I drove out to see what was happening and found no customers there. Surprisingly there were two cooks behind the glass who pretended I wasn't there and stood there in awkward silence . 5 minutes went by with no one even acknowledging my presence and finally a cashier showed up. I told her I was calling to place an order and she told me the phone never rang . Once again I ordered the Kobe Beef burger and once again... All out! Really?  After FINALY having enough of this I emailed the restaurant and explained the poor service and no one ever acknowledged the email . Needless to say the new ownership has definitely sealed the deal for me. The burgers are less tasty .. They used to be flavourful and moist and now they're dry and boring. I have no idea why the old owners sold but it's unfortunate because this place was in my top 3 burger places . If the food was as good as it was maybe I'd overlook the poor service but with the poor food AND The poor service ??? Well all I can say is they lost a loyal customer ... And that's JUST STUPID!"}
{"text":"I had a bacon cheeseburger or something like that. A little bit over priced and it didn't taste quite right."}
{"text":"Overall impression was nothing fancy, the floors were so slippery my kids fell twice, service was mediocre   Fries are hand cut and seasoned well, same with the onion rings  The burger was nothing special, especially for the price paid, my kids didn't like it very much and I wasn't very impressed   There are many other burger joints in the area that I would choose before going back  Not impressed"}
{"text":"Stupid Burger is crazy delicious. It's \"how fast can I shove this in my mouth\" good. The patty is coarsely ground, loosely packed, beefy, perfectly seasoned, and juicy but not greasy. The toppings are flavourful and fresh.   The onion rings are perfection. Perfection! I love them. They're thick rings of onion which hold up beautifully to the yummy, crispy, golden batter. Why can't every restaurant batter rather than bread their rings? And why can't every restaurant cut their onions thick so they hold up under the batter and frying process. People need to learn from Stupid Burger. They know what's what. The \"aioli\" dipping sauces are also yum. I tried the lemon garlic and the chipotle. Not a true \"aioli\", I would think. More like a mayo/sour cream dip. But I'm just guessing, I could be wrong.   The only thing I would change about Stupid Burger, and it's a very minor quibble since clearly I love them enough to give them five stars, is the bun. The bun was perfectly soft and had a lovely texture, but it appeared to be in the brioche family of buns and I prefer plain white buns, sesame buns, or a potato roll for a burger. I'm not really a fan of the taste of butter and you do get a bit of that with Stupid Burger. It could be the briochey bun or it could be that they butter the bun. I don't know. If I could get rid of that underlying buttery taste, I would seriously be in burger heaven here. If you like your burgers to taste slightly buttery, they've got you covered."}
{"text":"We have visited this smash burger place in the past. At that time, about six months ago, we were happy to make another visit. What happened since the summer? I have to rate this place as terrible for many factors. The floor is a glazed ceramic tile which was scary slippery when you walk in. Even with the carpets placed, there is an accident waiting to happen. We ordered their cheeseburger and poutine as a combo and took a seat. No one else was waiting for food at this time. I saw a burger in foil placed up at the window to be served and what looked like a poutine container. I waited, and waited, not knowing where the girl at the front was. When I stood up, I could see her, crouched in front of the cash register, texting away. So, at this point, I sat back down. About two minutes after that, she got up and brought that same burger and fries to us. The food was cold, duh, no kidding. I asked her if she could have the poutine microwaved. She put it back up on the shelf, where it sat, (then they figured out that the heat lamp was not on, so they put it on,) left the poutine to sit there for a minute or two and brought it back to me. To pay $20 for a combo and be served this crap, well, back to Five Guys I guess. Also to note, the owner was doing some business with another fellow, sitting at a table next to the cash. He never said a word. I knew he was the owner as he had asked me last time how everything was and struck up a nice conversation with me. Maybe the girl behind the cash was his daughter? Who knows? Other things to note, when we got our food, another woman came in and ordered the chicken burger, requesting no tomatoes. By the time we had finished, a larger group of students came in. Some of them had received their burgers before the woman's chicken came out. Very unfortunate, but I will not give this place another try. They do have many different specialty items, but if you treat the food like crap, then it is all the same. Stupid is as Stupid does!!!  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g499300-d8440521-r339678959-Stupidburger-Vaughan_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"I had a cheese burger and i was surprised it was actually good burger has a nice char and smokey flavour"}
{"text":"I suggest you don't go here if you're looking for something healthy (or cheap)! Super greasy fatty food...but oh so yummy! I had the Miami Burger with lamb (instead of beef) and it was amazing! The lamb was super tasty and not over cooked, and it compliment well with the ingredients (Chipotle mustard bbq sauce and pepper jack cheese etc). My husband had the Canadian burger and he loved it. We also had their chimichurri bacon poutine  and it wasn't so bad. We took the food to go, so by the time we got home (we live less than 10 mins away), it got cold. I'm sure if it was still hot the poutine would have tasted much better.  The only complaints I have about this place is that the service was slow and I think the prices are pretty high. Because the good tasted great, I still gave a good rating (4 stars). It would have been 5 stars if the service was quicker and the price was a bit lower. However, since the food ended up tasting great and was in good portions..i will give it another chance. I would consider coming back here again when I'm craving a burger and am willing to splurge, and don't want to go too far for one. Too bad it's pricey, if it wasn't so pricey, we would probably come here more often."}
{"text":"This place is following suit with holy chuck with their pretty eccentric menu items which include interesting options like bison, and lamb meat. Initially the creative menu begs to be explored, but as will be explained later certain deficiencies might discourage you.   Firstly, the structure of the burger is messy. Lets talk about the engineering of a burger(which most places overlook). The modern burger has a taste and structural foundation in a healthy amount of meat, and therefore less on bread(consider the most popular burger joints in Toronto today... they all have a heavy focus on meat, often making 2 patties the standard on their burgers, and bread being relatively thin). Stupid burger has a standard one patty, and it makes the burger feel overwhelmed with bread and toppings. To get more than one patty, you have to choose among the most eccentric of their offerings which are often too much. There is no middle ground of the basic burger with two patties option aka the classic bacon DOUBLE cheeseburger(at least it wasn't clear on their menu).   Secondly, fries. They were dry, and unseasoned. They were so boring that even ketchup couldn't save them, and I ate less than a quarter of them. It boggles my mind why salt wasn't put on the fries, nor salt visibly available to seated patrons.   Thirdly, milkshakes. The quintessential partner to the burger. I am glad they offer them, and wonder why nearly all of the burger competition in Toronto doesn't. But they do appear to be made with soft serve. Not ideal. I prefer real ice cream, and therefore didn't try the milkshake. But I could be wrong and they might be awesome. They got one star just for offering milkshakes at all.   Overall, I DON'T consider this an essential burger place to visit for hardcore burger enthusiasts. But it's eccentric menu might pique my interest if I happen to be in the area. Just skip the fries."}
{"text":"Being as I was going to visit my sister in law on the weekend just down the street was Stupidburger and I hadn't had lunch yet.  I've been seeing this place for a while and I had wanted to try it out.    Stupid burger is located in a strip mall near the southern part on the west side of Weston Road between Major Mac and Rutherford road.  It's kind of small and could be a little hard to find.  I had trouble deciding what to order.  The menu is really diverse and you get a choice of what kind of meat between Angus beef, lamb and another I didn't quite get but didn't need to necessarily hear.  They also had a deluxe menu which included some things such as lobster and Kobe beef.  Now while I didn't ask I know that technically the term \"Kobe beef\" is almost in all likelihood not true.  The term is often interchanged with Wagyu beef because Kobe beef is not really available in north America.  I didn't ask but like I said it's almost zero chance they actually got their Kobe beef from Japan.    It didn't really matter as I was going to get something different.  I had wanted to try something I hadn't had before, anywhere else and the reason was that the menu at Stupidburger is so intriguing it makes me want to try everything although that's simply not possible on a single trip that is...  So I went completely unconventional and when I say unconventional I mean my burger actually DID NOT have bacon.  That's right I went out on a limb here going all risque and such.  I had ordered the Maradonna which I'm guessing is in reference to Diego himself the legend which only has to be referred to by his last name.    I had also ordered a classic poutine which I was sort of surprised to find that there was chopped green onion in but I didn't mind at all.    The burger is described as, \"Brie cheese, chimichurri aioli, sauted onions and lettuce.  Now I could have added more of the complimentary toppings but I didn't want to stray away from the boxed dedication to one of soccer's greats.  The bun was a fresh brioche.  It was so fresh I honestly thought they baked it in the back.  It's nice to get a bun that's fresh.  You can have the best meat in the world but if you serve it on a stale bun you've lost a lot of cred...  The meat was really different.  It's not huge, but it's cooked properly but still juicy.  The taste is really good.  It tastes like a real beef patty, not some frozen form of what once was beef grinded into something tasteless.  This burger's got flavor and it's not afraid to show it off...  I was expecting a tang from the chimichurri aioli, it wasn't overpowering and neither were the onions but they added a nice compliment.  The lettuce from what I could guess was Boston Bibb, a leafy green, not some frozen cheap chopped head lettuce.    It's obvious that Stupidburger uses quality ingredients in putting together their burgers.  This place is not pumping out grease, but the contrary.  They actually have and serve quality food... in the form of what would normally be referred to as fast food.  The fries to me weren't anything special.  Perhaps it was because I had them in poutine form but I would have wished the poutine to have more flavor.  It seemed rather bland but the portion was quite generous.  I ended up also ordering a chicken burger and a Nutella funnel cake to go as I was going to bring some food back to my sister in law's house.  The Nutella funnel cake was pretty good but it seemed bunched up together because the entire thing was served in a small paper plate and covered again.  It came with a side of soft serve ice cream which was nice.    Overall the experience at Stupidburger was positive.  I'd love to try more of the menu when I get a chance and being that I go to Woodbridge pretty often the chances are more than good I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to stupid burger and tried the duck poutine, as everyone in Woodbridge had been talking about it. Can't say it was the best poutine I ever had as I found that it was way to saucy and lacking on the cheese. It wasn't stringy and gooey as I would expect poutine to be. The duck flavour was delicious. I'd say More duck and less sauce!"}
{"text":"So FANATSTIC....delicious beyond compare.  A little pricey but who cares when you can eat Kangaroo meat?"}
{"text":"Stupid Burger has raised their prices destroying the competitive advantage they use to boast over Five Guys, Burger Priest and Holy Chuck.  I still love the smoked out burger but a $2.00 plus tax hike in price is just stupid, the burger is now priced at more than I used to pay after tax  I may return once in a while but I will be going there about 15 times less per year due to prices being worse than competition."}
{"text":"Came in around 5:30 PM and the place was empty. Pretty small burger place with few seating. Their burger prices are noticeably more expensive than average. So it must be good, right? Wrong.  I got a cheeseburger for $6.95. Most burger places cost about $5.  The quality of meat they're using, which I believe is the Angus beef would be better as a steak than ground beef that's why I believe the burgers are dry.   I find that the burger isn't even tasty and I find it's not worth the price. The burger was bland and the patty looked so small. I asked for mayo and there was barely any mayo on the burger. My BF got a burger as well with some toppings, and off the bat the burger is really small compared to other burger joints.  What I find funny is that the fries that came with the burger combo even tasted better than the burger. I got a small gravy on the side which is not watered down thankfully, but it tasted just OK.  They have a wide selection of free toppings, and a good menu of wide selection as well.  Service is pretty quick. Surprisingly in a span of 10-15 mins the place got packed with students / kids with their parents. Thankfully we got there before the crowd.  Over-all I would not even rate this place in the same level as Burger Priest / Fresh Burger / Main Street burger. I think it belongs maybe a little higher than the level of Harvey's / McDonald's.  I would not come back. Wasn't worth driving an hour for."}
{"text":"The Stupid burger is  2 angus burgers 2 slices pea meal bacon 2 slices bacon Pepper jack and cheddar cheese Sautee onions and mushrooms Mayo lettuce tomatoes and fried egg   The Stupider adds another angus burger  That's a handful  Add the Tempura Jalapeño and you are all set  These guys rock!"}
{"text":"Lets just say that my wife and myself were Stupid Burger rookies. The young guy working the front desk suggested the Miami burger to me and the fish burger to my wife. Both great choices. We also added an order of amazing and not greasy sweet potato fries. All in all, worth the drive to Maple! See you again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty facilities....out of all the unique items and just not worth it...so very disappointed"}
{"text":"Really solid burgers! A pleasant surprise. Not quite on the level of Holy Chuck, and definitely not as good as Burger's Priest, but much much better than the usual burgers available in the neighbourhood. I would definitely recommend a visit.  I had the Smoked Out with smoked cheddar, chipotle mayo and coleslaw and I was really impressed. I think they put the completed burger on the flattop - whatever they do, it hold together well, instead of simply falling apart in your hands.   My fellow burger fans had: a straight-up cheeseburger with bacon, and gave it a thumbs up, and another had a bison Taj Mahal, which got, and I quote, \" a solid 3.5 stars out of 5\".   Also: the fries were really tasty, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I had stupid burger. The taste it self is very good, it's has three or four layers of meat and bacon really makes the whole burger has nicer flavor. For me the burger is really good and fresh.  However I spend 16$ on this burger. I think this is a little pricy even compare with other non fast food burger(maybe because they hire too many staff)"}
{"text":"The smell stepping through the door... oh yeah. Found the place from a mention in the Burger Binge thread and it sounded pretty good. Fantastic burger, nicely seasoned, perfectly cooked and all the toppings fresh and tasty.  Among the better burgers I've had. Fries were also really good, but there was no salt, pepper or vinegar available that I could see.  They came with only a little cup of ketchup. That however is the worst thing I can say about the place.  I'll have to go back again soon as I didn't have time to check out the whole menu, line up forming behind me forced me to go with my standard toppings, but they have a long list of very interesting toppings I wouldn't mind trying."}
{"text":"Well I certainly don't feel stupid after eating a burger from Stupid Burger, which I assume is a good thing. Either way, I don't eat at Vaughan much and I passed by this place and remembered hearing it from a commercial so I figured I give it a shot.  Not surprisingly, the place was empty when I visited at 9pm on a Tuesday. However the cashier was more than welcome to take my order, in which I ordered the brie blast. For $10.95, the price is about standard to all non-fast food chain restaurants.  It took a while for the burger to be ready (~15 minute wait), but if quality is to be expected, I expect it to take a while. The patty itself was a little dry, but the ingredients that came with the burger were excellent. The saffron aioli was a very unique sauce that I highly recommend for all burger orders. The brie cheese had not too strong of a taste, but melted perfectly with the patty. Finally, the mushrooms and lettuce were an excellent touch with the saffron aioli.  Service wasn't too great, but I suppose it was near closing and they just wanted to close shop as soon as possible. Either way, I will definitely return to try out some other signature burgers."}
{"text":"it's a small unit in a strip plaza, with limited parking available.  The plaza is busy with high school kids running around.  Once you get past them and into the restaurant. you find it's a tiny place and can get rather loud & noisy.   Getting around the crammed tables/chairs is awkward too.  Pricey meal and no real atmosphere.  It was a Burger, what I expected but nothing more.   Won't go back, and I'm sure that's what most customers leave thinking.  Just a one time visit.   Too many options nearby:  Hero Burger / Five Guy / A&W / McDonalds  sorry Stupid Burger, but you gotta offer more"}
{"text":"Well, today I trekked out to Woodbridge to try a burger that I have never tried before at a place called Stupid Burger. It's a pretty dumb name if you ask me but then everyone I mention this place to says that and it makes people talk about it and in the end, I guess, that is the point.  But I am not here to talk about the name. I am here to talk about the burger and I was very excited for this burger. It has some good things said about it online and in general I am always excited to try a new burger, especially if it bills itself as a gourmet burger joint.  Stupid Burger is located in a small strip mall on Weston Road and is kind of hard to see. It's not a very big place and the inside doesn't look all that great. It's got a few tables, a pop machine, a pop fridge and it is all rather cluttered and looks as if restaurant design was an afterthought.  The menu, located over the counter, on the other hand is massive and sprawled out and is easy to read and nicely designed. There are many options to be had for the burgers ranging from a hamburger to specialty beef burgers to veggie and chicken burgers. Then there are the 'Gourmet Burgers' which feature kangaroo or lobster or Kobe beef amongst other things. They also have a variety of toppings (like zucchini or pineapple chutney or smoked buck) and aioli's that can be added to any burger (or come on the specialty burgers).  I order a double burger, well a 6oz hamburger with an extra patty and the usual generic toppings, and made it a combo with fries and a drink. The drink was root beer as this sadly is a Pepsi establishment. The damage came to just under $12.50 which is pretty damn cheap these days. I sat and waited, reading over the menu. I would of loved to see the burger being cooked and built but there is no view to the kitchen.  After what felt like 5 minutes, not very long at all, my food was ready. I dug into the fries first which were amazing. Similar to the fries at The Acme Burger Company in shape and size they were crispy outside, soft inside and ridiculously addictive. I loved them but after a few I had to stop and try the burger. I washed my mouth out with a bit of root beer, unwrapped my paper wrapped burger and got ready to dig into it.  The first thing I noticed, before the bite even, was that the size of this burger was huge. Huge. It was probably the biggest bun I have seen so far and yet the patties fit nicely on it. The bun was toasted, perhaps a tad too much as the top and bottom were a little more crispy than I usually like or want. It wasn't so bad that it would ruin the burger though. I lifted the top bun and got a quick look at the toppings. Thin sliced tomato, water soaked soft onion strips, shredded lettuce and shredded pickles.  So how did this burger taste? It was alright I guess. Not the best burger but like many of the average burgers it was very middle of the road. It was beefy and tasty but there was no juice and it was way too dry. The onions were amazing, the tomatoes to thin to really taste. The lettuce fresh but not enough of it and the pickles were good but suffered the same fate as the lettuce by not being enough.  Back to the patty itself it was, like I said, to dry. It was a grilled burger and they use Angus beef (everyone does these days it seems). Maybe it was just my burger or maybe they cook all of them this way but as a first timer it was a little upsetting. It also crossed my mind that this burger was so well cooked that it couldn't of been put on the grill when I ordered it. Maybe I waited longer than 5 minutes? Maybe?  Now if the burger was less dry, the bun a little less toasted and the toppings had a little more care put in them (sans the onions) then I'm sure this would be a much better burger. Again, maybe it was just mine and they aren't usually like this. I'm also sure that if you were to order one of the signature burgers it would probably be a lot better. And if you were to have a Kobe beef or Kangaroo or Lobster burger maybe they would blow you out of the water (if you dare eat such a thing).  But as a standard burger, based on my one and only experience, it needs a bit of work. It's not a burger I would run back for but if I was in the area I would return; there is just to much competition out there these days. All week I have been very excited to go out and try this burger. I walked in, ordered and tasted the fries and my excitement only grew. I bit into the burger and all the excitement went out the window. Like I said, it's not a bad burger, I just wish it had been better.  Maybe I'll come back and review the Kobe beef burger some day?  Out of 7 Stupid Burger scores 4"}
{"text":"The food is great here, bar none. Great variety and lots of high quality food. If you want something interesting, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is casual and the place is clean. It's a good spot to stop to eat.  Having said that, they didn't have any meat for their lobster burger and their diet soda option did not work. Required a bill adjustment. For fast food of the more expensive variety , you'd not expect that . Still, one experience doesn't speak for the bigger picture."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  I went on their website and their menu looked delicious and I expected a lot (my mistake) I went in to the restaurant at 8pm (an hour before closing) and they were packed up ready to go home.  That should have been my clue.  I ordered their veggie burger,  chicken sandwich and fish sandwich.  When I get home I open the burgers and I was horrified.    The veggie burger had no portebollo, the tiniest peice of tomatoes (the end) and wilted lettuce.  The chicken burger had no tomatoes,  wilted lettuce and doused in mayo.  And the fish although fish was cooked nicely, had no coleslaw and doused in mayo.  We asked for pickles on all three burgers and didn't see a thing on either.    I would have been better off at a fast food joint."}
{"text":"A new burger shop opened up within walking distance so we just had to try it out. We have been seeing signage for the past few weeks for Stupid Burger and the name alone peaked our interest. We saw the review left by Jennifer K and definitely had to stop by and try it out.   It was reasonably busy when we walked in, but that gave us enough time to peruse the extensive menu. With choices like, beef, kangaroo, lobster, bison, lamb, and all the toppings and sauces it's definitely a hard decision to make.   The owners were in the shop watching the World Cup match while we were there and asked us how everything was and offered us free ice cream after we ate which was very kind and generous of them.   We sat and enjoyed the game and some very tasty burgers, I felt a little more adventurous this day and went for the kangaroo burger. The taste was great, but being a lean animal I think it may need to be mixed with something with a bit of fat so it's not so dry. I also wasn't a fan of the particular sauce on that burger, but that's personal preference. The beef burgers were great, juicy and flavorful. The fries were thick cut and well seasoned. Next time I intend to try one of the poutine options. Unfortunately they wouldn't let us substitute the fries for poutine in the combo.   Overall 4 burgers (1 kangaroo, 2 regular and 1 bacon cheese), 2 pops and an order of fries was just over $30, Ronald McD can't beat that. Plus the free ice cream cones, nice bonus.   The owner also advised us that everything including all sauces are made fresh on site."}
{"text":"Ok So I went yesterday with a friend and saw a 15 dollar burger on the menu called the Stupid Burger.   I had to see if I was stupid enough to get it.  I was very stupid.    I got this behemoth burger with two patties, peameal bacon, Bacon, and a Fried egg on top.   You absolutely need to be hungry to eat this burger. I felt ultimately disgusting after I ate it.  Not to say the burger was bad. I just wasnt ready for it. Period.   After hours of meat sweats, I regretted my choice. I need to go back and try a regular burger to re-access.   While eating it, Iiked it. About half way through, I felt ashamed in myself.  Try if you dare."}
{"text":"Just came here today.. Reason for the 4 stars is because of the fresh ingredients and amazing choices to choose from. I was expecting the burger to be out of this world with my topping choices.. Here's what my toppings were for my Angus Beef Burger or should I say, Stupid Burger? Lol..  Portabello Mushrooms Satay Onions Coconut Aioli  Lettuce Tomatoes  Extra Ketchup.  It was a good burger, but very greasy. Would I order from here again? Sure, why not, it's fresh and good but I cannot lie, I was expecting better. I also got onion rings and it came with some mayo Chipotle sauce. It was decent, but greasy.. I've had better onion rings. But again.. Not bad.   Customer Service: Very nice guy, he knew what to recommend and wasn't cranky or miserable. We had a little chat and I enjoyed talking to him. For a burger joint even the customer service was very good. It was packed with students inside and I can tell they were enjoying the food. Try it out for yourself but this is my opinion. The End :)"}
{"text":"I am feeling kind of Stupid at Stupid Burger.  There are just too many choices to choose from. The menu is printed in such a small font I can barely read from the counter.... and really I can choose between lamb, bison and beef patties?  At least with their Signature I don't need to pick from the numerous of topping!  I just randomly picked The Brazilian ($8.95) in honour of World Cup.  Fried Egg,  caramelized onion, bacon and pineapple chutney. The combination works amazingly well. The freshly grounded meat has a wonderful bite.  Aside from lamb and venison, there is also kangaroo! Maybe I will order one of those next time. And for the less adventurous there is also chicken, veggie and even lobster...  Staff is super friendly and helpful. My burger was delivered to my table when it was ready!   Join the Stupid Club and Sign up for mobile phone message will get you a free pop during your first visit."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special. Burger was slightly burnt. Staff was friendly but it took over 15 mins to get an order of two burgers. There was one order in front of us, the only had two combos."}
{"text":"I went back again to try the different kinds of burgers they had to offer. Turns out they also have a loyalty option that I finally asked about on my 3rd visit.  I had the kangaroo burger which came with a fried egg and wasabi aioli. I found the meat to be a little on the dry side and I myself don't enjoy wasabi which is a personal preference. I also got the smoked duck poutine which was absolutely great! I normally don't like toppings on my poutines but this did not take away from how one should actually taste. On another day I got the stupid burger and I'd have to say it was very delicious. Overall, this is a new go to burger shop for me."}
{"text":"Back again, used the gift certificate that I won for posing a review on yelp. Today I had the bacon cheeseburger and my fave smoked duck poutine.  This place is still hit or miss but today was on the hit side, these guys suddenly got it all right! The rings and fries were in stock (often they say one or the other is not available)...burger was well cooked, juicy and tender, could not find an issue with it, duck poutine was picture perfect and tasted great, I would definitely say the smoked duck poutine is their signature dish and well worth having."}
