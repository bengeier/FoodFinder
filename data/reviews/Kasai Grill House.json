{"text":"Great experience.  One of the best AYCE KBBQ restaurants I've tried in Toronto. Food quality was very high, meats and seafood all appeared to be fresh (no discoloration or off smells here).  I really like that Kasai doesn't heavily marinate their meats like some other places and instead rely on fresh seasoning (salt and pepper) and an in-house KBBQ sauce for post grill application.  Special mention for their house made hot sauce, which was actually not so hot, but subtly sweet and highly enticing.

The selection is quite generous even with lamb being blacked off the menu.  Shaved beef, short ribs, chicken, pork belly, shrimp, squid, salmon, white fish, mussels, pineapple, peppers, mushroom, onion, lettuce, miso soup, seaweed salad, kimchi, daikon, various rolls, ice cream (try the black sesame!) and cakes (and probably more) are all included in the price. 

Service was excellent.  Attentive without being invasive.  They even offered to replace the non-stick grill for us several times, which is not something I'm used to when dining at other KBBQs.  The non-stick grills were fantastic and we probably could've made it through the night on just one.  The staff really nailed the sweet spot on our grill.  Meat seared nicely without any burning. 

Overall a great experience.  Service truly was the highlight.  We will return."}
{"text":"Although this place had great service, this is not traditional bbq.
I looked up the top Korean bbq places to go in Toronto, and I have to say it was disappointing.
They don't give you all the sauces and ban Chan that a Korean bbq place would."}
{"text":"I was delightfully impressed with Kasai Grill House! The service was quick and the food was delicious. I was throughly satisfied with the amount and quality of food that I got for the price (very reasonable). The waiters even changed our non stick grill when we decided to order fish. 

It is a good space that can accommodate a lot of people. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They got variety of food choice, and the seafood is fresh compared to other korean grill houses.

The first problem is it's understaffed, only got two waitress handling 10 tables, which is over 30 customers. Although it's busy, those two waitress still try their best to serve us. However, we waited for three glasses of water for almost 30 minutes. In addition, in the end, the waitress told us she is too busy to serve another run of dessert. (But, she eventually tried her best to get us more ice-cream!!)

Orders come quickly. However, some of the items are missed. The waitress told us that it's not enough, so she didn't give us. However, in the 3rd round, we ordered the same thing and get it. Don't know if the restaurant are worried about we had too much expensive items, so choose not to give us.  

All in all, the food is better compared to other korean BBQ! Better choose not so busy time visiting!"}
{"text":"This is a great grill house and it is the best one I ever go! Especially, they also offer sushi which is include with AYCE dinner! The meat is very fresh and delicious! Also, the quality of seafood is good! I like the place with smoke free grill.....I really love this place and I will keep coming in future. Also, the service is very nice too."}
{"text":"First of all, we asked about the Yelp check-in and the server let each of us check-in for 10% off.  And it was a Wednesday so it was free pop!  

The quality of the food is OK!  We had been hesitant based on some of the reviews indicating the meat was not fresh.  I think the discoloration comes from the meats sitting in marinade, with some pieces covering each other up.  It wasn't too busy the night we were there, so the meat is probably pre-portioned and stored in the fridge, waiting to be brought to the tables.  Anyway, what we had was fine - the marinades tasted good, and there were no issues whenever we asked for refills of food.  More was promptly brought to us.
  
The only strange thing was when one of us asked if we could switch from diet Coke to iced tea, when it was time to refill the drinks.  The answer was no, even though the drinks are fountain drinks.  (The reason for the request to swich was that the diet coke seemed a bit \"off\".)  

One suggestion is for the corn to be parboiled before bringing them out to the tables to cook on the grill.  An uncooked \"slice\" of raw corn cob does not cook well on a grill, and literally just dries up.  We tried added some marinade over it while it cooked, but still ended up with semi-cooked dried out corn.  

Service throughout was friendly, and prompt.  There were multiple offers to refresh the grill top with a new one, but the grills were really good and were fairly non-stick all the way through the meal!  

Ventilation in the room was good, and neither of us smelled like Korean bbq when we left the restaurant.  A real plus!"}
{"text":"Good quality, good service. Would definitely come back here again. Dropped by on a Thursday night and the lamb was incredible! Parking was hard to find though so plan ahead if you're driving."}
{"text":"There weren't much smoke from the grill pan like other korean bbq restaurant I went to..so my coat doesn't smell disgusting right after... variety choice of meat and seafood. However the waitress only allowed us to order dessert ONCE even though it is all you can eat and without telling us that we can only order once. Some of my friends only had one tiny scoop of ice cream and couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place when I went on opening day. The selections on the menu are great, especially for its price and it even includes sushi and dessert options. Other Korean grill houses that i've been to don't compare in the selections of food you get to grill, and some places cut you off your first round of seafood. If you buy a soft drink that also comes with free refills (friggin bonus!). They also season all their meats and seafoods so it gives your meats an extra kick in flavour. The grill itself impresses me, it's a non-stick grill so your fish doesnt break and your grill doesn't get charred and turn black like other grills. Overall I can't think of anything bad to say. Definitely will be coming back here whenever I'm craving kgrill."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner with our friends and I must say it's a good place.food was good and fresh and you have such a big option of what to order like chicken beef seafood veggies... 
and even sushi. 
I like the shrimp and the beef steak the most.
Place was clean and service was the best they came all the time to ask if everything is good. 
What we don't like was we had to remember the server all the time that they forgot one item and it was like going on half of the Order didn't showed up at all.
It's family friendly and I would go definitely back again.  
Very recommendable if you plan to have a Cousy bbq night.
So if you hungry late night I would go and have some sushi there."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 10 on a Saturday evening. The parking was challenging but still found a spot near the restaurant. The restaurant looks up to date, they were playing the blue jays game. Their food was quick and fast, we loved their service. We watched to watch game 6 Raptors vs the Pacers but they didn't have tsn. They did give me their iPad to stream the game, loved it. Back to food, it was delicious. I will be coming back and maybe bring a bigger party this time."}
{"text":"Quality of food was disappointing and service was TERRIBLE.  Meat was brought out first (before appetizers, lettuce, anything else; before grill was even turned on) so it just sat there on the table for a good 10m.  Had to ask for red pepper paste.  Servers did not speak enough English to even understand our drink order. Even though food order was marked on a paper menu similar to dim sum, they still managed to get it wrong. Brought us the wrong rolls and when I tried to explain that they didn't bring what we ordered the server insisted it was ok/ours until we gave up and just tried to eat it.  Some time later (1/2 way through the dishes someone from the back came out and apologized that they brought us the wrong thing and dropped the correct order on our table).  When we tried to get our ordering paper back to order second round the server couldn't remember which one was ours so she dumped all her order sheets on the table and I had to sort through them to find mine. Worst Korean BBQ experience I've ever had. Don't waste your time/money."}
{"text":"This is probably the best all you can eat bbqs around. I came here on a Wednesday and the special of the night was free pop with refills. Check into yelp and get 10% off as well. The dinner menu was $21.99 and well worth it. 

The meat variety was good and the cuts of meat were thicker than the paper thin meats you get at other ayces which made the chances of the meat burning smaller.  Service was good.. I did go there at 10 pm and there wasn't many tables there but was never rushed since they close at midnight. Food that was ordered was brought fast and came in just the right amount. Now onto the flavour. The things they marinate their meat with is just right! Made me actually like to eat chicken at bbq. 

On top of this they over a pretty good sushi menu and free dessert! Ice cream and cake are the options. I had black sesame ice cream it was an awesome way to end the meal.  

The grill were non stick and I didn't even need a change even though the server recommended I do but it wasn't even black at all. Like when cooking fish it was fine and the fish never broke apart sticking to the grill. I also notice there were no suction vents but it was never required since it didn't produce much smoke either.

For sure I will be back when I crave bbq. The sushi is a plus and service was on par."}
{"text":"In the days since my visit, the owner has reached out to me under both 'Yan L.' and 'Nelson K', both comments, defending their products with no sense of professionalism.

I`d like to point out from my previous review, the 3 stars I had given, was awarded towards the service and their method of using a non-stick grill - definitely NOT 3 stars for the food.

I've stated the ribs were extremely dark in colour, and did not seem fresh to me. In comparison to the pictures 'Nelson K.' posted, there are differences in colours - which leads to not believe the problem lays in the marinade.
Along with concerns of the 'white fish' I received, was completely dried up & glued to it's tray. That night, we ordered multiple portions of the white fish. Some trays were normal, one or two trays had fish completely dried up, and glued on, no sight of moisture left, as if it has been sitting around; hence the concerns in freshness.

I was hoping to return, once Kasai Grill moves past it's opening stages, and hopefully has the opportunity to mature a bit. As I have stated PREVIOUSLY, Kasai Grill has (had) potential.
However, in light of the recent events and lack of professionalism by it's 'owners', I most definitely will not be giving them my money, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with my 2 brothers and we had a groupon ($15 for $25 worth of food) so essentially one person was free. Kasai is tucked in Little Italy right by Christie station. Price is $25 per person which is a lot for the food (under-seasoned).

I have been to a few other Korean BBQs and this would compare as quite average. They have the typical meat selections, a good range of seafood (salmon, fish filet, squid, etc), veggies, appetizers and sushi.

Meat- we liked everything on the meat menu but it could definitely use more seasoning. We asked for hot sauce on the side.

Seafood- not bad but a little bland.

Veggies- lots of variety and everything was fresh!

Appetizers- everything was yummy, wide variety..but the mini fried buns ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! 

Sushi- freshly made but you get quite a few pieces per plate which can be really filling so its best to order the single pieces if alone.

The service was prompt and friendly. Would go back with a groupon but its not really worth $25.

Note: On your birthday its 50% off and during the birthday month its 15% off!"}
{"text":"Went here on a groupon for all you can eat grill + sushi at just $18, cannot complain about that. But overall I do prefer Korean Grill House. The service here was... strange. We were a large group with hungry males but our server felt like telling us we were listing too much on our order sheet. We ate everything. Next, the meats are less flavourful here than at Korean Grill House. I also prefer the BBQ sauce at KGH. The BBQ sauce here was watery and flavourless. The kimchi and seaweed salad were both tasty here though, I liked those. It was also pretty awesome to combine grill with sushi. The sushi was fairly good, I've had worse but also have had better. Though watch out combining ayce sushi and all that rice with ayce grill, you'll tap out much earlier than usual!"}
{"text":"Service was really good, but the food unfortunately, is not. They don't give you hot towels at the end to wipe your hands with, or a mint either. Been to better grill houses."}
{"text":"Was ok.  Went the Valentine's Day.  Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of cook it yourself"}
{"text":"The biggest problem that I can point out about this place is that EVERYTHING IS SO TASTY AND GOOD that you do not know whether to keep eating sushi or switch to the barbecue.

I went to have dinner with a group of friends and we were amazed by how tasty and good the meat and fish were (it is also fun to cook things by yourself directly on the table), but then came the sushi and wow it was so good too! Make sure you try the crunchy avocado one and the dynamite rolls - if I could I would have eaten a 1000 of those."}
{"text":"Wear stretchy pants; you're going to need them. AYCE for just under $30. 

It's a bit weird to cook your own food at a restaurant as I feel like that's why I went out, but at least I didn't have to clean up after. It was a lot of fun tho!

The servers were pretty on point with keeping the food coming. We had a full table so we were going through the small trays pretty quick. All of the meats were pretty good; the beef and lamb were my favourites! The fishes stuck tothe grill more than the meats. Some things cook quicker than others, so be patient! If you don't want to wait, don't order the chicken! Veggies also take forever, but you gotta have some veggies on the grill! 

After awhile everything will stick to the grill and your server will replace it with a fresh one. I didn't expect that!

You can also get food you don't have to grill, like sushi and dumplings. I feel like that's cheating; if you want sushi, then go out for sushi! The non-grill items were all pretty good tho! BUT, this is all about the BBQ!

Good experience and worth it for the price."}
{"text":"This place is slightly different from what previous reviewers have mentioned. 
Firstly, the price has gone up. Currently it's at $25.99 per person on weekdays ($33 all in), 2 dollars extra on weekends($36 all in).
Secondly, soft drinks no longer come with refills, but are only a dollar per glass.
Lastly, the dessert options no longer include anything other than ice cream.

Food-wise, everyone who mentioned the meat as bland is correct. They barely salt their meats, but as a result their meat and fish are fairly fresh and they are still marinated. You can just drench the meats in soy sauce if needed. This is where this restaurant comes close to authentic KBBQ with good quality, albeit somewhat bland tasting meats that you add toppings to. Lettuce is a menu option which I appreciated. 

The sushi was standard AYCE fair and the variety and option for sushi is a nice touch with choices of western rolls, standard maki, hand rolls, and nigiri. Dynamite roll is probably the best choice though.

Service was adequate despite there only being 2 servers on a Saturday night. No real complaints.

Other reviewers commented on the lighting, which was a dingy fluorescent white. While it didn't bother me, it makes an unfortunate first impression.

Overall if you can overlook the lack of salt in the marinade, the higher quality meats and the inclusion of good sushi makes this a slightly better option than many of the mainstream 'westernized' KBBQ places. However, the price now is quite a bit higher than the average AYCE KBBQ place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a birthday celebration during a weekday and was pleasantly surprised how well the sushi were as I thought the focus would be more on the korean bbq side. We only tried the sushi rolls and they were freshly made and didn't have too much rice. Their wasabi was nice and strong to my liking as well. The chicken and beef for the bbq were nicely seasoned, however, the ribs were less so. Decor is not the best but the background music was pleasant (popular songs/latest hits). There were only 2 staff members on the floor and they were nice and attentive. They changed our grill without asking after our first round. Note that it seemed like you can order ice cream only once, so decide wisely!
I would like to come back to try their other sushi rolls that are only available during Friday-Sunday and Holiday."}
{"text":"This place has all you can eat Korean BBQ and includes some sushi options as well. I've been here twice and have enjoyed my time here. Servers are nice and attentive. The price isn't too expensive, so it's worth it for all the food you order. The tables are a bit too close, so it gets a bit cluttered if it's busy, or it might have just been the area that I was sitting in, which was the table for 8+. Overall, I like coming here because I get the option of both kbbq and sushi!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times since the beginning of the year and it was pretty good for an ayce kbbq place. Even though it's all the way on the west end of Toronto which is pretty inconvenient for an east sider, I still went out of my way to go here. But after coming in on a Saturday night around 9pm I must say it was a complete 180 from all the other experiences I've had! 

There were only 2 servers the entire night which made the service go down hill from there. Usually they take our food orders but I guess only having so many servers, the lady gave me a pen and paper to write down what I wanted each time. (She only did this with my table, i noticed her taking orders at other tables) We didn't even get water till we asked for it AFTER we got all our food. There were only 7 tables and some of them contained groups of 6-8 people. Knowing that they were somewhat busy, we were willing put that lack of customer service aside but honestly it seemed like they didn't even try!

I was okay with the beef and lamb but the chicken seemed like it was picked up from left overs from other peoples left overs that they didn't finish!! Coincidentally they didn't have any more chicken after the first order. For the sushi...let's just say that visually you can tell right away that the fish was not fresh! Also it was like a 30 minute wait for our sushi. I can't believe I even have something negative to say about the ice cream because the server who gave it to us scooped us a icecream scoop that wasn't even in a shape of a scoop??? It was literally a flat piece of ice cream with very little portion.(literally zero effort at this rate) 

I know it might of been a bad day, or whatever the matter was causing there to be a lack of workers/ quality. But if you're going to open your doors to the public, things should be at least somewhat organized!! I was honestly so shocked and disappointed returning here, don't think I'm going to go out of my way to come here anymore."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. Very reasonable price and the sushi was even better than I expected for an AYCE BBQ place. I've had better meat quality at other Korean BBQ places, but they weren't AYCE eat either. Basically, you can enjoy pretty decent BBQ and sushi until you're stuffed to the rafters for little more than $20. Dessert is quite poor however. The cakes were very cheap and tasteless and the ice cream would've been passable had it not been freezer burned. Won't let it affect the review since it's an afterthought, but don't bother leaving room for it and just go full-tilt with the meat."}
{"text":"Meat and seafood was overly greasy. Service was unreasonably slow. I waited over half an hour for food to be taken to the table. When food did arrived, I was disappointed to realize the incredously small serving sizes.
One assumes that when one orders 1 serving of shrimp or an order of fried dumplings, one when get a small bowl of a few of each item. However, this skempish restaurant serves a serving of shrimp as 1 piece of shrimp...I mean who would expect a serving of shrimp to be an individual puny shrimp?
As such, I had to make multiple orders of food, which translates to longer waiting time.
This restaurant do strictly adhere to its 2 hour time limit for AYCE. They cease food service 1 hour 45 minutes into your meal, regardless of the service time and kick you out at the 2 hour mark. If you still have food left slightly past 2 hours, HA! You are in for an extra charge: the restaurant will charge the remainder of the food at prices on their a la crate menu.
That wasn't all. When I received my bill, I was surprised when the restaurant arbitrarily slapped a 10% service charge on my bill although nothing was mentioned on the menu nor by the waiters when I first arrived. To add salt to the wound, I was appalled that the restaurant had the audacity to recommend a tip.
I tried refusing to pay the bill but the owner selfishly argued that '10? tip' is common practice in the industry and that he would not remove the charges.
While this may be true, the restaurant owner has no right to tell the customer that. Tipping should be totally up to the customer, and it should be to the customer's discretion to decide whether to tip and the amount to tip.
Based on the level of service provided, a 5? tip would be generous, needless to say 10?.
Kasai Grill House is by far my worst experience at an AYCE restaurant in the City of Toronto. Never had I had met a restaurant management that is so focused on the bottom line that it cuts back on the dining experience (serving size/time) and controls the amount of tips a customer is OBLIGATED to give!!

AVOID THIS MONEY-STEALING and MEDIOCRE SERVICE RESTAURANT AT ALL COSTS!!!!"}
{"text":"Great modern Korean BBQ joint in the city. You have your own grill at this restaurant, and they have an AYCE menu as well as an a la carte menu for very reasonable prices. There is sushi available with AYCE, and it was pretty tasty. The meats had good marinade and the seafood was fresh. I would definitely come here again next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Not our first time to a Korean BBQ (though first time here), so we were familiar with the procedure as were the rest of our party. Once we figured out what we were getting first round (it is unlimited... for 2 hours) we were ready to roll. For a Saturday night it was not crazy busy so we were able to get proper service - water refills, changing or the grill, raising and lowering of the temperature of the grill. 
Plus: The addition of both Sushi & BBQ allows for everyone to have something, especially when cooking. Nibbles of spring roll or dumplings a nice choice.
In the end our group left full and satisfied.

TIP: As an all you can eat it is a reasonable price if you are hungry, however if you are more diet oriented or for smaller appetite consider the Board special at almost 1/2 the price. 

Drawback: Would be nice if they had some choices in sauces (only 2 regular soy sauce - and house soy sauce-sweeter), would be nice to have had choice of low calorie or spices to zing it up."}
{"text":"Great service - very attentive. The lighting is bright LED however we asked to have it dimmed and they did which made sitting at the table more intimate and enjoyable for our table. The best was the beef and the ribs. The weekend specials were great too. Not crazy in chicken or fish or didn't order. Great time and great food! Cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"Yes!  I hadn't had Korean BBQ in so long.  We had a booking for about a dozen and we ended up getting two tables that seated 6+.  The difference between the tables that seat 4 and the ones that seated 6 is the 4 seaters only had one burner in the middle while the longer 6 seat tables had 2 burners.  It's such an advantage to have 2 burners for 6 (1 for every 3 people) as opposed to only having one burner for 4 because the cooking can basically be expedited.

For dinner on a Thursday, the special of the day is that they provide lamb at no extra charge.  Each guest for AYCE is basically about 23 dollars (plus tax and tip) which isn't bad considering AYCE for dinner is some places can be more.  While it can seem the place gets busy and it was when we were there last night, the service was still pretty much on top of things as far as getting what we asked for.  Mind you yes, there were some things that were missed for whatever reason (them dumplings though...) for the most part asking for refills on drinks, asking for more food etc were taken care of in reasonable amounts of time.

Being a table of six (not including the other table because they are ordering for themselves), the first go around we had basically asked for everything to get a taste and see what we liked.  When I say everything I mean the meats and seafood and only a couple veggies.  Let's me honest here, veggies are complements to a meal like this, not a main considering you're paying for AYCE.  For somebody like me I consider veggies a \"misallocation of spatial resources\".

With this AYCE meal the menu also has a variety of other non-having to cook yourself options like the evasive fried dumplings, starters like miso soup or wakame salad and a decent variety of sushi whether nigiri, temaki or maki cut rolls.  Yes, you can get your starches in the form of rice if you don't want to only eat BBQ'd things.  

Keep in mind there is a 2 hour limit for dinner because you know this window of opportunity must end at some point.  We actually took the full two hours and considering everybody at the table was busting but we still had to cook our own meats and seafood, that's fair.  The cooking itself doesn't take long for a majority of the items.  Things like chicken and bacon, yes you want to make sure those items are NOT undercooked but the beef slices, short ribs, lamb are thin enough that they cook rather quick.  All the seafood generally speaking (salmon, squid rings, etc) they too cook very quickly.  Some of the seafood however sometimes sticks to the grill but there's nothing you can really do about that.  After realizing what our favorite selections were we dropped what we didn't enjoy as much and ordered heavier on what we liked.  The lamb is very thin so if you want more you'll have to ask for more at once.  The beef short ribs were also a favorite at the table so we had stacks of those too.

The burner is hot and the goal is to keep it always cooking something and to remove it when it's done so yes, it's a nonstop team effort of getting things put on the grill, clearing the dishes they came in and stacking them at the end of the table as well as turning the food to ensure proper preparedness.  Oh and you get to eat the fruits of your labor too (bonus).  Just because you cook the food yourself doesn't mean the servers are not pulling their weight.  KBBQ gives you the freshest made meat and seafood possible because you're eating it right off the grill while it's still sizzling.  The amounts of plates the servers have to bring back and forth is basically along the lines of any AYCE place where trips to tables is practically excessive so it's not just a drop plates and see you later kind of deal.  

When the circular grill gets too charred with food, they will replace it for you.  Once you get the hang of how to maximize cooking and what takes how long to cook your team can be a like an Olympic rowing team.  Get in synch to cook and consume as much as you can in your two hour window.  

While each diner is given a set of tongs I recommend using one set as \"dedicated raw food\" tongs.  These are the tongs you use for handling the food directly from the containers in which they came.  Use another set to turn the food and use another set to take the cooked food off the grill.  Try not to use the \"raw\" tongs with handling the cooked food etc.

Oh by the way there's a 10% discount for checking in with Yelp as well."}
{"text":"The meat desperately needs more seasoning, or they need much better sauces!! All of the meats needed more seasoning, except for maybe the chicken (which takes forever to cook). With that said I still did enjoy the experience. I thought that seafood is their best category (maybe because seafood doesn't need much seasoning... haha). My favourite were the shrimp. 

The service here is also amazing! They have this one particular Asian lady who is super nice and cute. The others are all quite attentive too. 

Overall I would say go for it if you're in the area but don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a while ago when my friends were searching up on Yelp looking for a Korean BBQ place near downtown. This restaurant showed up with a very positive rating and at the same time was offering 10% (?) off, so that's how we picked it. A few things to note: 
1. You'd be asked by the restaurant to give a yelp rating in order to enjoy the discount. 
2. This was just an average ayce BBQ restaurant, meaning the quality of the meat and veggies were just ok. I don't think it was anywhere close to ~4+ stars though. It was on par with Korean grill house.
3. Service was prompt as when we went it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"I read a previous old review about the meat or something not being fresh and other criticism in general for quality etc. I was already in the works of heading there with my boyfriend and friend, so reading this I was thinking ehhh....but too late...already almost there. I find reading just ONE review of any kind of comment of severe lack of quality freshness of meat especially in ANY restaurant, makes me question and have a bad impression.

SO, my experience was great though! Then again, I did come on a Monday night. So service of course had to be top notch since we were the only ones there really. So I can't speak for the service, but from that night, yes great! 

I found all the meats to be of quality and well marinated because it seemed more flavorful than Chako the other ACYE korean bbq I had before. ALSO, I LOVE the fact that they offer black sesame ice cream because it's a pretty rare flavor to be offered because most places give you the choice of red bean, green tea, vanilla or something..but black sesame!! YAyuh!

They also call one of the meat choices on the menu \"bacon\" which I find pretty amusing because it's really not, it's just pork belly. But whatevs, I like their \"bacon\" or pork belly in general.  

I do like this bbq place, so do come visit! Probably my favorite AYCE bbq so far."}
{"text":"Positives....

- Good meat cuts
- Not smoky..I didn't smell like bbq by the end of the meal
- Attentive staff but we were the only ones there at 4:30
- Changed the grill ..almost 3 times but we were finished so no need..
- came to refill water without asking

Notes:
- 2 hr limit but really, who can eat that much?
- Will charge if you over order and not eat
- Friday, Sat and Sun add $2 more to costs

Will be coming back for sure....sooooooo stuffed!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Korean bbq and sushi, its cheap and better than most AYCE places in terms of quality for the price. The atmosphere is great as well as the service, the waitresses are always kind and I get the food very fast!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and attentive.  They made sure my water was full at all times and changed the grill after one round of food.  They have the standard items on weekdays.  Weekends has lamb and beef rolls."}
{"text":"Three notable things from Kasai Grill House puts this from a 3-star to a 4-star  place in my opinion:

1. They marinate their protein well to add flavour while making it more tender.  Even chicken, which is traditionally the longest to cook, seemed quicker with the sesame marinade.

2. They offer lettuce leaves, raw garlic, and even the korean dipping sauce so you can wrap your delicious kbbq'ed items before chomping down.  This mimics what you would get with the authentic a la carte Korean grill experiences.  Have not encountered another AYCE KBBQ place that offers it.

3. They have ice cream and cake selections for their dessert choices.  Bonus is that they don't have the absurd one dessert per person rule that other AYCE places enforce.

Although this place has just opened recently, I was quietly impressed by the overall experience here.

We visited on a Thursday which was unexpectedly quiet (6 covers total which included us) but that just meant we got really attentive service.  They changed our grills several times over the 2ish hours (that is the supposed time limit) we were there so there was never really obscene build up of burnt stuff on the grill.

I think I would like to visit again in the future for another experience. :-)"}
{"text":"Awsome place for KBBQ, foods are fresh, friendly staffs. Best KBBQ place in downtown."}
{"text":"Worth a visit. Parking can be an issue. Prepare to walk to the restaurant. Fun grilling your own food. Addition variety in sauces would have been nice."}
{"text":"Honestly this is not a bad place. It's a good for a first time try but not the best kbbq I've had. (In comparison to chako). The meat felt a little cheaper in the sense that it wasn't quality and not marinated well enough. I did like that they had a large variety of meat, sushi and seafood to choose from. My favourite was the sliced beef with some soy sauce and the rice. 

The service was pretty good, there were only two other tables dining so they came around with water and asking for any extra orders. 

It isn't as worth it as Chako BBQ but like I said not a regretful experience!"}
{"text":"Biggest pluses: 
1) open till midnight when many other nearby restaurants have closed 
2) the open grill pit in the middle of every table - cooks your food AND keeps you warm on a cold night
3) options - so many options as part of the all-you-can-eat menu

Pointers:
1) don't just fill up on sushi rolls - take advantage of the grill - there are veg and meat options - I mean you can't go wrong with grilled mushrooms!
2) the maki is extremely unexciting here, but the tempura rolls are good
3) be prepared for strained communication - English fluency is limited in the wait staff but after a few tries the message gets through

Downers:
1) definitely not the best sushi - not fresh, pretty dry and no thought put into the presentation - also too salty
2) if you're taking out friends, things get very pricey very fast - I essentially paid $100 for mainly sushi for a party of 3 (no drinks or anything)
3) they were all out of hot bowls, forcing us to get the all-you-can-eat option

Other tips:
1) some items are not available on certain days of the week - check the menu closely
2) definitely get the ice cream dessert - all flavours are good and it's a small portion so even if you're stuffed, you can still handle it
3) best bang for your buck if you go ALL MEAT"}
{"text":"Good food. Great service! The waiter there was extremely nice and very helpful. It's all you can eat and the sushi rolls are nicely done. Nothing too extravagant, but still better than most other places. Overall a good experience with the Korean-style cooking pots and seafood."}
{"text":"AYCE Korean BBQ is heaven on a cold night!  For about $28 (tax and tip included) you can stuff your face and get the meat sweats here :). The price includes apps, your main (meats/seafood/veggies) and 2 choices of desserts.   They also have sushi as well!  All that food for under $30!!

Each day they have a special - the Thursday that I went it was free lamb.  Some days have free soft drinks or cheap beers.

The space is large and they have several tables that accommodate 6 people, with 2 grills at each table.  This is pretty awesome b/c it means more food can be cooked at the same time.  For this that don't know, Korean BBQ places are ones where you cook your own food on these grills on the table.  It's a great experience if you haven't tried it.

We basically had all the meat options they had, plus all the seafood ones as well.  The standouts were definitely the lamb and short ribs - so tender and delicious.  I'm still dreaming about that lamb!  The salmon and shrimp were also yum!  And surprisingly I enjoyed the calamari as well.  I didn't like the mussels and the chicken was ok.  I had the mango ice cream for dessert- nothing fabulous but after all that meat I wanted something sweet. 

The service was a bit slow but we did have 16 or so people in our group.  

Definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the good reviews. Sometimes Yelp is not a good indicator.

Food: This is not a good Korean BBQ, the meats were very bland.
The vegetable options were not appealing at all. Sushi was okay for a buffet, but not great.
They ran out of beef short ribs with hours to go before closing. As a buffet with very limited options, you'd think they'd have more stock, especially since there was only one other table besides us.

Service: the Wait staff were extremely awkward. The small talk felt forced and random. They never wrote down your order, so they often forgot things and you'd have to ask again.

Decor: What is with the lighting inside? It's an awful piercing fluorescent white light that makes you uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the ambiance...The food was great, we tried a bit of everything...I personally really liked the beef and short ribs. For desert go for the mango ice cream!! Great service! Highly recommend for anyone who likes Korean BBQ!!!!"}
{"text":"Bought a deal from the Groupon, it was useless and total rip-off. It's like paying a full price plus the deal that you buy online. They complicate the deal by charging you a different amount. Food is ok but Everything is too salty. Lady server is very nice and pleasant, the guy is somewhat letting the lady do all the job and not very pleasant. Not worth the money and the hassle l you pay for."}
{"text":"Would've left five stars in the beginning because our service was amazing from a taller thinner man, anything we needed he got for us with zero attitude and kept visiting our table. Had a great first experience!

Came back at 7:30-8pm when they closed at midnight. Working in restaurants, I understand how annoying it is when people walk in late so we made a point to get there earlier on in the night.

We were served by two girls who were extremely rude as soon as we walked in the doors. They sighed when we would order more, and turned off our grill before our food finished cooking. I had asked for a refill several times and got ignored- then told that every time I refill I was charged a dollar. I told her that was fine and she swiped my glass away with attitude. The servers stood in front of us giving each other shoulder rubs, chatting on their phones and totally ignoring the TWO TABLES they had inside. Even while billing out, they got so upset that we asked for the debit machine.

Once again, I understand what it's like to be a server. But it's a tough job. If you can't handle it, get a counter job.

The food is ok though, they changed the menu recently and the sushi tasted relatively cheap. It's 23.99 for all you can eat as an adult I believe. 

wish I had the other server again, if I did I would've had another great experience!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Korean BBQ place I've been to. Cannot even compare it to Chako and Korean Grill House. I'd have to say that the servers were very attentive often checking in and cleaning out dishes. However, the food was terrible! We went on a weekday dinner and ordered the beef, beef ribs, pork shoulder and chicken. The only thing that was marinated was the chicken. Everything else just had a couple dashes of pepper on top. Usually I love beef ribs but this was probably the worst tasting beef ribs. It tasted so gamey and had a strong meat taste that was just revolting. I don't understand how they think they can just give their customers plain meat to grill. The chicken had a light marinade and was the only thing that was okay.

I would never come back and never recommend this place to anyone. Please if you want Korean BBQ...Go to Korean Grill House that's just a 15 minute drive away."}
{"text":"Dined here for a birthday party.  They offer 50% off if it's your birthday month.  I was excited to try this place because I haven't had an all you can eat bbq and sushi for a long time.  It is $22.99 for dinner with an extra $2 on weekends.  They also offer weekend special meats, rolls and appetizers.  

There's a huge selection of appetizers.  My friends and I shared one of each appetizers and we enjoyed it.  Their weekend special is the cucumber smashed salad and I was not a huge fan of it. 

There's a huge selection of meat, seafood and vegetables. The meat that stood out most to me is the bacon-it was more like pork belly and their enokitake wrapped with beef sauce (weekend meat special). They tasted delicious! I enjoy eating veggies and was satisfied with the different variety they had.  

There's also quite a lot of sushi rolls/hand rolls to choose from.  They tasted average and there was a moderate amount of rice in it. 

They offer different kind of cakes and flavours of ice cream. The cake tasted average but a bit rough.  My favourite dessert was the black sesame ice cream (drools)."}
{"text":"Me and my friend just went to dinner here. We called ahead and they were eager to have us so we headed over. The service was great. Our servers brought our items quickly and they were not out of stock of anything. The quality was great, everything was very fresh. The best items were the short ribs to me. I don't eat sushi but they had several options. My friend had a dynamite roll that she said was really good. It was a pretty large portion also. We ate until we were content and tried our best not to waste anything. They also have free wifi. 2 helpings of dessert is included per person. We only used one each. I had green tea ice cream and my friend had cake. They were small portions which was appreciated after our main meal. The green tea ice cream was clean and light. They have specials during the week like free lamb Thursday's and whatnot.

They've been open about 7 months and I hope they keep up their standards because it's good right now. Oh and upon check in I got 10% off. I think the quality of food and service here is exceptional and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is very underwhelming. I am here as I write this and despite only being half full it takes forever to get service. We've asked for water 5 times and I still haven't gotten it. Ended up drinking my friends ice cubes"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO. Meat is poorly seasoned...has no taste... Even the servers looked ashamed of their what they are serving...I feel very ripped off. It was so bad that I made a yelp account specifically to post this....."}
{"text":"DONT GO TO THIS PLACE. Very rude staff and very dismissive. Would not patronize this restaurant at all. The decor for the area is below standard and the establishment definitely needs to be upgrades. Dont be fooled by the groupon deal... they likely need to offer Groupon deals because their customer service is SOOOOO bad.. Would not return eveeeer. This place won't be in business very long being unkind to tourists.. Try the Italian place across street..."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Friday. It is an AYCE restaurant. 22.99 Monday - Thursday and 24.99 for weekends and holidays. Their beef mushroom and Beef green onion rolls are really good. I loved the beef ribs here, they were soft and flavourful. They had ayce tiger shrimp and salmon. The quality of food is higher than most ayce places. There is more variety here than at other restaurants we've tried. Definitely recommended to go if you're craving kbbq."}
{"text":"Food was really good! All the meat looked fresh and tasted delicious. Thought some of them tasted a bit bland at first but then we realized they have bbq sauce in a soy sauce bottle. Sushi rolls were very good also. There weren't too many people for a Saturday night but there was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The meat doesn't have any flavor and  the two Chinese lady was keep looking at us because we did not finish eating sushi so  when we pay the bill the charge us 8 dollar extra for the sushi we did not eat and  the weekend price rise from 26.99 to 28.99"}
{"text":"Good quality, sufficient variety but lacking consistency in flavouring. 

I like that there's plenty of vegetable options for grilling and appetizers to balance out all the meat we ordered.  As for the meats, I noticed a bit of inconsistency between the marinate. The lamb and short ribs was very tasty but the beef slices lacked flavour. The beef enoki and onions (only offered on weekends) were the highlights of the meal. 

My last complaint is their sauces. The soy sauce was a very poor quality and their BBQ sauce tasted just like sugar with water. Need to step up the game here to justify the recent price increase."}
{"text":"Great Korean bbq: tasty meat, fresh vegetables and good sushi. Great for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly busy for a Monday. Only 2 servers working so items were missed and sometimes service was slow. This caused us to get duplicate orders of some of the food because we ordered again after some time had passed. The salmon sushi and rolls (spicy salmon and dynamite) were good. The meat quality was disappointing after all the good reviews on yelp. The beef was tender but the short ribs were more chewy than I would have expected with AAA beef. Also the bacon was really tough to eat; tasted like cardboard. Very disappointed as pork belly grilled korean style is one of my favorites. The salmon was good quality and fresh. Black sesame ice cream was really tasty to end the meal. Overall good experience but hopefully they get better quality of pork belly (bacon) in the future.
Oh, make sure you check in via Yelp to get 10% off."}
{"text":"Loved this place because it had both sushi and k-grill. The only thing was that the meats weren't that flavorful, but it was okay."}
{"text":"Staff: awesome 
Food : awesome 
Value : awesome

In summary I really like this place and will continue to come here regularly."}
{"text":"Came here with friends just to try thr place out. While the service was good and the place was clean, I wasn't really impressed with the food. The sushi was decent for a kbbq place but the actual meats were so thickly lined with pepper and it seems no other seasoning. Every order came covered in pepper to the point where every meat started tasting the same whether it was beef or chicken. Very thinly sliced which I liked, but not helpful when drown in black pepper."}
