{"text":"I just love this place !!!!!!! The employees are always very nice.......the food is always great.....the double bacon cheeseburger is awesome......I just feel it's good food, prepared right in front of you and served by very nice people. Thats all ya want, right? Good food and treated right.......they nail it everytime."}
{"text":"So so mall restaurant.  The service is hit or miss here, they can be great, but I've also seen them very poor. They yell at you when you walk past like most places, to come try their food. The quality of the product is actually the thing that draws me in. This food court has a lot to be desired so Flamers is actually one of the better ones.  They have pretty good menu and it's always tasty. The downside is that is there's more then 2 people in line it takes forever! They make the food in front of you which don't get me wrong is great. But it's takes so long if they have a bunch of customers."}
{"text":"Over priced crap. Also, I believe they douse your food in a weird chemical to give the food an \"authentic flame grilled \"taste. One of the The owners  is rude, but still have the nerve to say hi when I walk PAST them.   They got an attitude with me because I wanted an extra tomato slice. Forget this place. Not worth the money. TBH the whole Monroeville mall food court is a dump."}
{"text":"If I didn't love chili cheese dogs and chili cheese fries so much, then I wouldn't come here it all. The service here ranges from average to poor. When you walk past Flamers, an Asian man or woman will call out to you \"Hello! How are you?\" It's a good tactic to get customers to order food; it makes you feel welcomed, giving you the impression that good customer service is a priority. However, once you order your food and money exchanges hands, the customer service goes down hill, especially if there are a lot of customers after you. One day I ordered my food and, instead of handing me my drink while I waited for my food, the cashier- whom I assume is the manager as well- went quickly to the next customer. There were probably 3-4 people behind me and the same thing was done to them. It was like rapid fire. I don't blame the cashier/manager for trying to make some money, but I  felt like I was being ignored and shouldn't have had to wait 10 minutes for a diet Pepsi. As for the food, it is prepared by cooks who I assume are Latino. One irate customer questioned out loud the citizenship of the staff at Flamers. Despite the average to poor customer service, I continue to go because I love the chili cheese dogs and chili chees fries."}
{"text":"Usually my experiences are really good at Flamers, however it was very lack luster today.   The employees seemed rather uninterested which is unusual as i visit this location regularly. In addition to that my food was prepared without gloves (Ew) and tasted sort of burnt. I don't really think I'll be back for a while. Not at least until the health department pays them a visit."}
