{"text":"Food was good (my wife had the bleu cheese burger and I had the  Margherita pizza), service was prompt and friendly. Noise level too high to have any conversation. Might try it again but not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Regan's Public House, and it was a DISASTER. The poor waitress had to wait on nearly the entire restaurant, so it took over an hour to get our food and our drink refills. The \"changed menu\" has really gone downhill....the potato soup was very watery, tasted like nothing but water and oil. My husband ordered a meatball parm, was given chicken parm instead....but he was so hungry after waiting an hour that he didn't complain. My mother had the Reuben, but the \"corned beef\" was like no corned beef I've ever seen. We did ask to speak to a manager about our poor experience, only to find out there wasn't one there at the time! Never, ever going back."}
{"text":"This place is loud,the food is nothing to rave about the help slow and clueless. We waited  for 45 minutes for two garden salads! When I told them to cancel our order they said they would bring them right out, 5 minutes later they brought them out in a to go boxes? They will most likely be out of business about another month!"}
{"text":"Public House - bar, right?  However, the beer menu had no prices.  The waitress did not know the prices of the beers, either.  Also, the beer/wine menu was printed all on one page, and on cheap, dirty, wrinkled paper.  Wine was priced.  Beer was not.  Weird.

Hubby & I ordered a Reuben sandwich and onion rings.  When we ordered, the waitress told us that the corned beef was not ordinary corned beef, and had some fat in it.  - Okay, corned beef is fatty.  Bring it on. . . However, what came out in that sandwich was NOT corned beef.  The menu should have read \"Dry, tough, nasty roast beef sandwich\".  Maybe then, we would not have ordered it.  Unfortunately, even with the pseudo-warning from the waitress, we did.  Awful.  Inedible.  Really bad.

The onion rings were too big (wide).  They were fried in a cornmeal mixture that had odd spices and retained too much grease.  We could only eat one each.  At least they weren't frozen.

After 2 bites each, we put our napkins on our plates and were ready to leave.  A manager (I think) came to our table and asked us how we liked it.  We told her.  She was not very receptive, and said something like \"That 's just the way we do it here.\"  She wasn't rude or anything - just not receptive to constructive criticism.
  
Side Note:  This restaurant is in the 'front yard' of the largest neighborhood in Lancaster County.  The neighborhood is a 55-and-over Del Webb gold course community.  There are over 3000 homes.  Why plan a bar with an ambiance that is loud, cold, hard & dark?  All chairs and stools are spartan and all-wood.  There is not one soft feature in the whole room (no carpet, no cushions, no plants, high ceilings), which makes for a very loud, cold environment. I can only imagine the noise if there are more than 10 patrons in attendance. (There were only 4 other people there when we were.)  Thank goodness the TV's are silent.  Sun City is a Boomer neighborhood.  A retro-lounge atmosphere would have been much more well-received."}
{"text":"Recently went back to Regan's for lunch & discovered a lot has changed since my initial visit. Apparently, they lost chef & then changed out menu. Now more typical pub menu - nothing special. Food was ok... Service was fine. The only thing that was truly wonderful was the cheesecake -our server told us that someone who works there bakes all the cheesecakes from scratch. I would go back just for another piece of that yummy cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Rumors have abounded that Reagan's was closing, but they are wrong.  Reagan's continues to have a great bar and decent menu.

They tried breakfasts, but did not get the turn out so they remain a lunch and dinner place.  Brew and a burger while watching sports on TV?  Here!

There are TVs like a sports bar, but it is not a sports bar.  Don't get confused.  They have a great pizza dough that is yeasty and tasty.  You get regular thickness crust unless you ask for thin crust and that you will get.  And they look like the homemade they are as they are not perfectly circular, but odd shaped and slightly burned on the edges.

There are the regular array of sandwiches, salads and mains, so not many surprises.  Service is fast as the restaurant is not large enough to get lost inside and the staff can easily see who is waiting for what.

Living in Sun City we access via golf cart, so convenience reigns.  Otherwise there is plenty of parking in the HT strip mall where Reagan's resides."}
{"text":"I have eaten dinner and lunch at this restaurant at least 5 times over the past year with my last visit just recently . I have never had a satisfactory experience. This is a casual restaurant serving typical Anetican fare. The food is mediocre (although the burger is decent). The service is the worst I have ever encountered even when the restaurant is almost empty.  Once at lunchtime I waited 45 minutes for a hamburger and had to have it wrapped up or I would have been late for work. When we were asked if we enjoyed our recent dinner and we said honestly, no, the manager said \"well everyone else likes it\" . We will not be back. My impression is that the bar seems popular but if you want a table for dinner take my advice and go elsewhere ."}
{"text":"I had previously not been a fan of Reagan's but was asked by an acquaintance to give it another try.  So last Friday evening my husband asked me to go because he wanted to try their fish and chips.  I have to say it was a pleasant surprise.  The fish was cod like we were use to in Wisc, big round pieces and fried perfectly.  My husband never eats more than 2 pieces but that night he ate 4.  The fries were excellent too.  In fact I was sorry I hadn't ordered that it was so good.  I decided to go with a lighter fare and had soup and salad which was also very tasty.  I loved the mixed greens over the basic iceberg lettuce so often served in restaurants.  We left both impressed.  So earlier this week when a friend asked if I wanted to go somewhere and split a burger with her I suggested we go to Reagan's.  My friend was not a fan previously either but we were short on time and she agreed.  That night we ordered the mushroom swiss burger and it was cooked to perfection.  We had told the waitress we were splitting it and they even brought it out on separate plates.  Another friend ran in to us and she also ordered a burger and got the onion rings.  They were hand battered and big, OMG.  I have seen a HUGE improvement here in both the food quality and the staff and have to say they have won me over.  I was told that changes were being made and you can definitely see the change for the better.  From someone who said I'd never go in here again I'd say that means a lot."}
{"text":"This establishment has closed. Thank god. 521 BBQ is moving in and that is a plus. Can't wait to go there. They will now have a beer and wine license!!"}
{"text":"Fresh Food with a touch of flair at reasonable prices! I have been coming here for the past 2 years and have never had anything on the menu that was nothing less then exceptional.  Some of my favorites are the home made Fried Green Tomatoes with drizzled balsamic vinegar, fresh pizza that has a light and airy crust, fish and chips, and no doubt have the best burgers anywhere. 

Friendly local hangout that I highly recommend you come visit soon!"}
{"text":"I had the honor of accompanying my husband to Reagan's \"soft opening\" last night in Indian Land, and am so excited for what is to follow for this restaurant.

Located directly off 521, just outside of Waxhaw, Fort Mill and Charlotte, this bar and restaurant is perfect for folks like us who aren't interested in driving 45+ to downtown Charlotte for good food and, more importantly, craft beer. 

The atmosphere was easy going yet leaning towards upscale (without suggesting any pretension). I admired how few televisions adorned the walls as this seems to be the norm these days (think Duckworths in Ballantyne). My party was able to enjoy a normal conversation over dinner without raised voices or concern that others could overhear--perfect.

The service was on point. Our waitress was attentive, sweet and not overbearing. The bartenders suggested delicious new beers (all of which are brewed in NC, SC, or GA!) and the management was so nice and very interactive. Great group working very well together.

For an appetizer, we ordered fried green tomatoes. Delish. I wish there had been more, but I am after all rather gluttonous. Dinner for me includes fish and chips, handmade dip fresh cut fries. Yum! Everything was fresh and super tasty. 

I think we may have to return soon to sample more... And more reviews to follow!!  :-)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is still in business. I've been there twice now and each time it is pretty much empty. Maybe 5-tables filled. Last night was no exception. Our waitress was very nice but really clueless about the menu. They were out of basic things like fish and chips & every desert. I heard her tell two other tables they were out of different items as well. The menu is boring and way overpriced for what you get. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich ($9) and it was plain with no seasoning, dried out and just  gross. Others in my party made the same statements about their food.My kids ordered the kids spaghetti and it was the tiniest portion I had ever seen. It was just laying there in a huge puddle of butter. Blah. My children even made the statement that it was disgusting how much butter there was in the bowl. Almost like they ordered a bowl of melted butter soup. The menu seems uninspired and lacks any creativity or direction whatsoever. That was my last time going. I would give them 6 months tops before they shut down."}
{"text":"Went back to give it another go after the place being closed for a few weeks with the assumption that they had made improvements. Food was decent. I had a pizza which was fine. Nothing spectacular but not bad. Our server was great and there is a good selection of beers but the atmosphere threw me off. With the location it could, and should, be a goldmine but a good atmosphere is key for me to feel comfortable and enjoy grabbing a few beers with friends and they were still lacking that."}
{"text":"Our Valentines Day plans fell through so we ended up here. We were seated and we sat there for about 10 minutes until a waitress came up and said she would take care of us because she didn't know who our waiter was. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer and my wife ordered the shrimp scampi and I ordered a sirloin. The place wasn't very busy at all.  We waited about 20 minutes for our appetizer. Then about 10 minutes after that our waitress came up and said they were out of sirloin. So instead I ordered the build your own burger. Everything was good except the shrimp scampi. It tasted like regular noodles and wasn't worth the $14 we paid for it.  The waitress was really nice she did give us our appetizer for free. But the very slow service didn't make up for it. I don't think we'll be back."}
