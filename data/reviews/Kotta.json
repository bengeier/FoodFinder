{"text":"You must try the banana tempura with ice cream -- this has to be the best dessert in Parkdale. The banana tempura is striped with chocolate sauce, and the ice cream tastes homemade. This place is an oasis in Parkdale. The sushi has an gorgeous concentration of avocado throughout, and everything is mighty fresh; some of the best ginger slices I've tasted. Good service on Monday night, our green tea was constantly replenished. You'll have to go up to the counter to get your bill, they feel like it's rude to force you out, you know. At King and Dufferin."}
{"text":"Kotta Restaurant. I have to admit, you're growing on me.

I work in the neighbourhood, and I've been to Kotta for lunch several times now. The food is high-quality. The atmosphere is pleasant. The service is warm and generally efficient, although they can get busy during the lunch rush hour from 12:00pm - 1:00pm. They often take a while to bring you the bill - I've had to request it on more than one occasion after waiting around for several minutes.

The first time I went, I ordered the Assorted Sashimi, which was very good, but a little overpriced at $17.95. I love sashimi, but I never find it filling enough to satisfy my hunger on its own - I'm usually hungry again 2-3 hours later. 

However, they have one dish that keeps me coming back: the Salmon Teriyaki special. This is a truly excellent dish and very well priced at $12.95. The salmon is flaky and delicious, accompanied with a very rich teriyaki sauce. It's served with miso soup (hot, flavourful, and plenty of tofu pieces), rice (delicious, sticky), steamed vegetables (good, but sometimes a bit soggy), and a dynamite roll. The dynamite roll is so good; however, that it deserves its own paragraph.

What can I tell you about this dynamite roll? I'm sure you've had plenty of other dynamite rolls before, right? What makes this one so special, you ask? Well, it starts with the freshness of the ingredients in the roll. Creamy avocado, crunchy shrimp tempura, and mayo, all wrapped up together in one truly awesome roll of maki sushi. This roll is incredible. I'm not sure I'm even doing enough justice to it here. You should probably just order it for yourself.

In summary, this is a superb dynamite roll with a sushi restaurant attached to it."}
{"text":"Basic, small sushi restaurant - but amazing customer service, price, and take out experience (tea and order taken from a seat at the bar? Yes please.)"}
{"text":"We live just down the street and were looking for a good place to eat nearby without a wait. This place did not disappoint! Fish quality was excellent and prices were very fair. Attentive and prompt service as well. Definitely added to our neighborhood list and will recommend to any visitors to the area!"}
{"text":"great food and great service...i feel the food here is fresher than any place in the price range in toronto.  super friendly service and in a genuine way, hard to come by in this city.  thankful they are in parkdale and hope more people figure it out so they are here to stay."}
{"text":"Kotto's bento box lunches are tasty and a good mix of tempura, vegetables, sushi, salad and meat - a great value lunch! Other menu items are tasty and presentation is nice. Their green tea is very tasty too!

Servers are kind enough to split the bill if asked, but food service can be a little spotty - sometimes everything comes at once, sometimes only some dishes come while others are delayed. 

Overall: Kotto's a great place to go on King West, where sushi places tend to be few and far between, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"If you want $200 sushi go to Kaji. But if you want really good, everyday Japanese food like you'd get in the Tsukiji outer market, Kotta is great. It's the type of place you go to regularly for for an affordable, authentic, friendly and quality meal out. And the service/staff match the food quality. No attitude, courteous and always welcoming. We need more of this in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality and taste, had it delivered via Foodora, price is a little high for the amount they give though (usually can get nearly double for the same price other places around). All in, worth a taste but if you want double the amount good sushi for the same price there are other places to go."}
{"text":"The prices are incredibly high for the portion they offer. Food is below average. Customer service is A+ though. The problem is that i'm not getting my money's worth. Customer service doesn't make my stomach happy."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars,

I come to Kotta with my girlfriend all the time. The staff is friendly and the food is very good. The Seafood Nabeyaki Udon is hands down the best I've had in the city. The various rolls are always fresh and delicious. If you're in Parkdale, this is pretty much the best you can do. I will say that their daily lunch special posted on the board has never ever changed! it's always been a terriyaki combo. I wish they would switch it up once in a while! Considering it's located in one of the more scuzzy parts of the city, I'm always impressed by the cleanliness and comfort they provide. Great place."}
{"text":"I go here with my family. We don't come in here to eat full, we just come here to treat ourselves once in a while.

Food & Presentation: We mainly order the maki sushi rolls, the sushi is executed well and tastes fresh to me. They take care to present their sushi in a clean manner. The quality of the sushi has always been consistent whenever we come back.

Atmosphere & Service: I really like the wall display and lights. This restaurant is kept clean and tidy. The staff are very respectable and welcoming. My mom spoke to the staff and found out that the sushi chefs worked in sushi restaurants in Vancouver for many years and then decided  to open up their own restaurant here. After eating with my family, they treat my sibs and I to some Hi-Chew candy!

Pricing: Not bad, reasonable. Usually spend around $40 for 4 people."}
{"text":"Great veggie options for when you want to grab sushi with vegetarian friends. Sometimes the fish is fantastic, other times just OK."}
{"text":"It is what it is, a small run Japanese restaurant, but if you live in the area like I do, and you want really decent sushi at a very reasonable price, than Kotta is it! 

They have a decently sized menu, containing every kind of classic maki roll: California rolls, dynamite rolls, salmon-avocado rolls, kamikaze rolls, dragon rolls. Their sushi is fresh, never fishy smelling, served slightly chilled, and quickly at that. Their tempura is made to order and doesn't sit around like I know it does at some places. Miso soup isn't packaged, but made daily in house. 

Staff is friendly, always welcomes you, and always says goodbye. Waitresses are not obtrusive, but can sometimes be a little standoffish. They don't want to bug people. Dinner for two will run you about 40-50$, without drinks. Quality is great for a neighborhood sushi joint. Check them out."}
{"text":"Pricey for their size. Only good if you work near Liberty Village. Otherwise there's better option on Atlantic Avenue. 

They do takeout."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Can't get over the lunch combo. I eat hear weekly and wish I could go back more often. The purple sushi rice is like no other. The service at noon is okay. They have a very busy eat in and take out clientele so be prepared. The outside patio is unshaded and is full by 12:15 on a sunny day. Plus they may not know you are even outside! However the people are nice and the food is outstanding. Give it a try if you love Japanese food. There is a small selection of Korean food on the menu too."}
{"text":"We were a little scared to go in here at first, because you never know what you'll step into in Parkdale but now this is one of our favourite places to go in the neighbourhood now! The interior is really nicely decorated and clean, the service is good, they greet you at the door and are friendly too. The food is solid - the sushi is even better than some of the more 'upmarket' places further towards downtown. Prices are average, food is fresh and tasty! Our favourites are the Avo-Cu rolls, Yam Tempura and Gyudon. Their Katsu Curry is not the best I've had but still decent enough. Kotta is definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant and the best of its kind in Parkdale.  I've been here multiple times and I enjoy it very much.  If you work or live close by, make sure to check out the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I would literally let a (semi distant) family member die in order have another one of their crunch rolls. I dream about them. 
Living in California has taught me that good sushi is hard to get; unlike in Toronto, there's a huge variety of good sushi places but Kotta has the most bombastic Crunch Rolls that has ruined other sushi places for me."}
{"text":"Me and my wife have been here a few times now, and we now consider it our go-to place for affordable, quick, yummy foods in the neighbourhood. We don't care for how they use mayo in some of their rolls, but they happily hold-the-mayo when we remember to ask.  Their rolls are good & generous with the filling, their green salad is better than most comparable places, as is their tempura. Also the people remember us & are super friendly :)"}
{"text":"Very good price and decent sushi,, If your looking for affordable sushi in Parkdale this is it. Really nice restaurant, which is surprising seeing the area it is in is not all that fancy."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm going to update my not-as-nice review for Kotta. 

In the almost two years since my last review, Kotta has stepped up on their service. I go to this place on an almost weekly basis and have anything from their sashimi and tempura to their teriyaki rice dishes. The dynamite roll is by far my favourite maki roll by them. The staff is courteous and friendly, and they always greet me when I walk in and out. They even know me by name. The fish is fresh, the food tastes great, and Kotta has a squeaky clean DineSafe record. You can't really ask for more in Parkdale."}
{"text":"I am giving it 4 stars because it's in Parkdale where sushi anything is a rare find - and though the food is not exactly outstanding - it's still edible(when I say that I mean that it's still enjoyable), the fact the it's there at all to satisfy my random cravings.

I miss Hue's that was here before but like I said, I need a Japanese place in King West. Overall it's a good little spot - decent price, food and service. That is all."}
{"text":"This is one my regular 'lunch fares' as it is walking distance from Liberty Village where I work.  Overall good food, although a bit overpriced for the amount you get.  The ingredients are very fresh though. 

Bento boxes are a good combo deal, though you don't get as much (amount) food as in other places, but the ingredients are all fresh.  The seafood nabeyaki udon is also very good, but pricey at $12.

One thing to look out for: their 'spicy' sushi/rolls are exactly the same as their regular ones, except for this 'spicy' orange mayo on top.  The mayo is very unpleasant (to me), and I usually have to scrape it off. 

Good choice for grabbing lunch if you don't bring it from home like me."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised about some of the high reviews that this place has received.  We were craving sushi and decided to order in using Foodora.  Since we're all about supporting neighbourhood restaurants and wanted to try a new spot, we decided to try Kotta.  Based on my star rating, it's probably quite apparent that we were extremely disappointed.  It's never a good feeling spending $70 on food and throwing half of it away because it's so unappealing  that you just don't even want to eat it.  The beef yaki udon was very greasy with a few shavings of beef.  Definitely not the yaki udon I'm accustomed to and was expecting.  Also the noodles were much denser than typical, more reminiscent of shanghai noodles than udon.  The maki did not taste fresh + there was very little fish and a lot of mayo.  Everything was generally sub-par and very disappointing.  There are so many better options within walking distance that I'm still kicking myself for not going with one of the tried and tested choices.  I would recommend steering clear and ordering from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had high hopes... but really not good. Ordered basic rolls: spicy salmon and spicy tuna maki. It was awful. Way too much mayo mixed in with very little fish - so little, I couldn't even taste it. It was mushy and really unappetizing. I chose not to finish it and will not be going back again...ever."}
{"text":"Decent sushi for a mom and pop restaurant - fish was fresh. A decent dinner will cost you about $80 for two people including a drink each. We had fried gyoza, tako yaki, unagi dragon roll, dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll, and red dragon roll."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 or 4 times without issue. 

This time our food was thrown out after 3 of us all asked it to be packed up to go. They even took the food and left the other dishes on our table. Our toddler who was accidentally dropping rice was being stared at by the manager. It was obvious and made me feel very unwelcome.  Maybe she was having a bad day but it made for a very unpleasant experience and we will not be dining here again.

If you have a young family, save yourself the $90 and don't go."}
{"text":"If this place was in any other sushi concentrated neighbourhood like the Annex or Queen West it would probably only get 3 stars... but on King west we get slim pickings!

The staff is nice the place is very clean and the prices are surprisingly good. 
Call ahead to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Great, personalized service where they remember your order and your name. Straightforward sushi and sashimi, made with love and very fresh ingredients. Not a huge menu, but it covers all the basics."}
