{"text":"A great place to get coffee and dessert with friends!  We had the Pink Velvet and Chocolate Truffle cakes. Delicious with a cappuccino and an earl grey tea. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Brisket was very dry. Prices are nearly double what they should be. Desserts are not homemade - they're dufflet. Weak effort. Give the place 6 months."}
{"text":"\"Desserts\" should be in quotations. I went in expecting home made, because = it's in the name. Said desserts were just a couple basic cakes from Dufflet. Took two slices home ($8 for a skinny slice), both were stale, and came floating in a puddle of melted whipped cream. Next time I'll just go to Dufflet."}
{"text":"We live nearby and were very excited to try this place. The food was great and the staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful! We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood. The foods are very good. The price is not so cheap, but by considering the amount of foods, it is not bad. The place is spacious and the seats are comfortable. They have varieties of selections in their menu, but I do not think they have exciting desserts. The service is okay. We will never have bad experience."}
{"text":"Went to Zelden's for brunch last Sunday to finish off our ten day stay in Toronto, food fantastic, service excellent, meet the owners who are hands on running and working this fine Deli , when in Toronto call in and give yourself a treat, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The man in the front cutting meat does not wash his hands. He was touching my sandwich after handling with money. And it is very over priced for the quantity of food"}
{"text":"A great Jewish deli in the heart of midtown.  The sandwiches are good, the portions are generous, the prices reasonable and the staff very friendly! (Edit -1 star: one staff member neglects the customers.)"}
{"text":"I just discovered Zelden's and so glad that I did! I had the BEST Reuben that I've every had--it was a fusion--reuben served on soft tortillas. The corned beef was lean and so tasty, the sauerkraut was yummy and the taco was not overwhelmed with Russian dressing. It was flavourful, lighter and an incredibly yummy version of the classic. Service was friendly, even for take-out. Definitely worth a return!"}
{"text":"We are a family of three who ordered a sandwich, hotdog and Greek salad. The sandwich came out after 15 minutes and the hotdog and salad never arrived. After waiting for another thirty minutes we asked what was happening to the missing meals.  The cook said he was too busy to have started them although the diner only had one couple in it!   We paid for the meals we didn't get and left.  Would not recommend for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Place has the best sweet potato fries ever. Smoked meat sandwich was also off the charts. I also had a half pastrami but the smoked meat topped everything. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I live near a Pickle Barrel, so I'm always on the hunt for good deli food. Zelden's had been garnering almost nothing but positive word of mouth since it opened in 2017, which meant that it was just a matter of time before I found myself sitting down for a meal there.  We knew we wanted to try their deli sandwiches, but we weren't sure what they were best known for, so we asked. Brisket and pastrami, we were told, so I went with the latter.  It arrived a short time later and it's good. Really good. The meat is spiced quite well and there's certainly a good amount of it. Certain pieces were a little rubbery and hard to chew, though.  There's regular yellow mustard at the table and also their homemade concoction, which is super spicy and very tasty. I meant to ask if they sell bottles of it to take home.  The accompanying coleslaw and pickle are also quite good, while the fries, ordered separately, are definitely a cut above."}
{"text":"When you are more expensive than delica, and your food is on par with druxy's; that's a problem."}
{"text":"Solid deli north of downtown, their fries are pretty lit. Sometimes find it hard though to justify spending 20 bucks on a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced new deli at yonge and st Clair. The smoked meat and pastrami are pretty  good but not the best I've had. Every time I've eaten here, the service has been good and I've been satisfied with my meal. The Latkas are super tasty but I've noticed they've gotten smaller each time I've been there. However, one thing thing that drives me crazy is they refuse to put lox on an eggs Benedict. They have a smoked meat eggs Benedict and they have smoked salmon dishes. When I asked if I could substitute lox for smoked meat (happy to pay more) the waitress was adamant that the owner/chef would not allow it. It seemed like others had asked by her response. I've avoided going here for brunch since then because 9/10 times I'm craving smoked salmon eggs Benedict! I don't understand their problem with this!!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Zelden's Deli and Desserts.  Apparently they opened about eight weeks ago.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich, minus the coleslaw (it was $11.95) and it was a good sandwich.  It was served on light rye bread.  There were two bottles of mustard on the table (regular and dijon) so you can put as much or as little as you want.  The bread was soft and fresh and the meat was warm and tasty.  I felt like something sweet and saw lemon meringue tarts in the fridge and couldn't resist (it was $6.95).  It was a good tart.  The lemon wasn't too sweet.  It arrived showier than I expected.  The ice cream and strawberry were a nice surprise and the jam was a bit too sweet.  Taylor was the server.  She was nice and friendly.  I'd stop in again if I'm in the area and wanting a deli sandwich ... there were lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a few days ago. I was debating between getting the Breakfast Nest and the Eggs Madeleine but chose the latter (I'm a sucker for smoked salmon). It was pretty good and filling! My partner tried it and said he preferred Sunny Morning Breakfast down the street. He ordered the Chicken and Waffles Benedict, and that was delicious! Next time we come back, I'd order that or try some of their deli meat."}
{"text":"Zelden's is a comfortable deli with a nice selection of usual deli standards. The sandwiches are always fresh and tasty, and the salads look good although I haven't tried one. Service is friendly and attentive. Prices are reasonable considering it's near Yonge and St. Clair. There's lots of seating and there seems to be steady take out orders too."}
{"text":"Great place along Yonge and St Clair. I went there with my fiance for brunch. Great place. Amazing service. Fast service as well. I ordered the waffle and chicken. Originally I was shocked to see it was chicken tenders instead of a whole wing or quarter chicken. But wow. Mind blown. Chicken tenders were cooked to perfection and as well as the waffle. I want more!!! Craving it so much"}
{"text":"Glad I didn't order the soup or I would have had to forgo the TTC for walking home!  For a sandwich I have made at home countless times, the prices here are a shemozzle."}
