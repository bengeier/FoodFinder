{"text":"Tasty is super falafel and super nice staff!! Wish they'd allow more then three salad choices as they all look good but as of now their salads are max 3 choices but they are good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, best falafel in Montreal. Value is crazy, super loaded tasty pita. If you can handle hot, ask for it, totally worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Authentic Israeli style falafel and sides.  And I would know, being from Israel and all ;)  owner super friendly.  They also have vegetarian general tso and vegetarian Shawarma all made from shittake mushrooms.  So good.  Meat eaters would enjoy them as well.  And their sweets...  Don't even get me started.  Fresh homemade chocolate rolls with halva in the middle.  Now I don't have to go all the way to Israel to get my fresh halva fix.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Falafal is what this place should be called! I'm a hardcore carnivore and the veggie menu was great! A must!"}
{"text":"The best Falafels I have had to this point in Montréal.  Like everyone mentioned small local with no parking. But 100% worth it coming from the South Shore to eat here."}
{"text":"I officially believe in this place. Nuff said."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best falafel I've had in town- authentic Israeli food in Ville St. Pierre.  I've been waiting for a fresh healthy option in the area near where I work, and this hit the mark.  I've been back three days in a row to try several menu options- the classic falafel, the sabich, and the Tunisian tuna sandwich- I recommend any and all to whoever who will listen.  Friendly service and a homey feel- I'm hooked."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite food and restaurant!!! Even meatlovers will love this place, you cant get better falafal sandwiches, salads or fries anywhere else.   Delicious food and fresh as ever!Bright and cozy, owner and workers all extremely nice and inviting. Did I mention the falafal pita sandwich..it was insane! I couldnt be more enthusiastic about this place, a bright little gem in  V.S.P"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Very friendly. But... The lady at the cash needs to develop better food handling practices. She wears her rubber gloves constantly... Whether it be handling food, packaging food, wiping up, or handling money. This is my only gripe but unfortunately it's a major concern and will keep me away."}
{"text":"So so happy to have a place to have some good falafel. The spicy is actually spicy. The falafel balls were made fresh and light, the way they are supposed to be. Left here happy and thinking about coming back."}
{"text":"let me start off by saying not a huge fan of falafels. when deciding where to go for lunch Falafel usually never makes the cut. Friend of mine said I should try this place so I did. I ordered the spicy falafel sandwich. I had it all dressed and this thing was busting out! You will not walk away hungry after having one of these bad boys. it was by far the best falafel I've ever had. super friendly service, and reasonably priced. next time I decide what to have for lunch , Falafel will certainly be in the conversation."}
{"text":"Best pita bread ive eat in Montreal !!!! Trust me !!!! Plus its veggie Nice spot and the service its perfect !!! Try it"}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday for supper with my brother and fiancé, parking really wasn't that bad and the place was not that busy (we went early before the rush). The location is small but it is definitely a takeout or quick eat kind of place. We both had falafels, fries and some baklava for dessert. The falafel was delicious and very filling. I also really liked the baklava.  Overall I would recommend, but it is not a comfortable hang out due to space and set up."}
{"text":"Simply Wonderful!!!  If you haven't tried this Falafel then you have absolutely no idea what Falafel tastes like!!!  Finally I can say that this is the best Falafel in town !!! Friendly staff and lovely place. It's small but it is nice! I believe it's \"ok\" for people with kids, but not with a stroller really.  I would definitely go out of my way to get a sandwich there, it is one of those places that you would make the trip to have a bite, I will be going again next week and will update my review.   Highly recommend it to all"}
{"text":"GREAT food, love this place! My only gripe is the parking, given all the construction and traffic these days. Not their fault, and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great falafel sandwich at a great price with quality ingredients, this place gives some more famous establishments a run for their money."}
{"text":"Never had a really good felafel until I ate here. Best thing about this place is they obviously put their hearts into their preparation of everything.  Never had a meal so filling! And yet so healthy at the same time. It's inspiring to eat healthy and love it at the same time.  Ps. I love to eat meat and fish. So this place is good for everyone!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Holy Land. Salam & Shalom to you all on behalf of the God of Abraham or was that Ibrahim? Arab or Jew or Israeli or Palestinian ... we can all agree on one thing ... A MULTILATERAL FALAFEL STATE SOLUTION !!! Yes, folks, next year in chickpea Zion. Come down to your local falafel maker and make peace with your own G-d damn neighbourhood chickpea master. Through the bountiful and unconditional peace of beautiful golden falafel. In the serene name and the holy light of houmous. On the first day Allah (the merciful and the bountiful) created the falafel and on the last day She made the houmous and all was well in Heaven as it is on Earth. Alpha & Omega ... Jesus, Mohammed and Moses ... falafel and houmous. Let us meditate upon the glory of chickpeas. From chickpeas everything came and unto chickpeas everything shall go.   Seriously though, the Levant can get a little silly sometimes, what with all the one God but three religions bullshit and the whole crusades and millennia of senseless murder but goddamn can a Semitic brother make some good food out of some chickpeas.   You've got houmous, you've got falafel, what more can you ask for? I'll tell you what!!! Everything here is guaranteed vegetarian and murder / cruelty free! There are many assorted vegetarian products! They are all very tasty. Vegetarian Général Tao, vegetarian orange chicken, vegetarian shish taouk, vegetarian shawarma, vegetarian butter chicken ... all of these vege \"meats\" are delicious and made 100% shiitake mushrooms.   Get all the Israeli delicatessen specialties you need! Chocolate halava, rougalach, hamentashen, bourek, kniches, tabouleh, houmous, did I mention falafel yet? This place has burgers, pita wraps, salads, tabouli, BABAGANOUCH, tahini, Harissa, eggplant salad, beet salad, potato salad, kubbeh, and French fries.   Come here and all of your dreams will be fulfilled.   Peace be unto you."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best falafel I've ever had and maybe the best Montreal has to offer. Worth a stop if you are about to get onto highway and worth making a destination if you're not. Good array of tasty salads. I had the trio (Falafel all dressed with two sides of salad). Service is friendly, even charming and I liked watching the food channel while eating alone."}
{"text":"Best falafel in town, hands down. Not crazy about the location but it's worth it to get your hands on the food. Always tempted to try all the other stuff they've got out on display too, looks phenomenal."}
{"text":"An Israel style falafel and other eastern med food.  Small n very popular, so try to go a little before or after lunch n dinner rush.  Good for take out n catering. Not cheap but two can eat a dinner for one.  Perhaps 1 extra pita bread. Pita differs from most Arab pita, being thicker. They open the pita n stuff it rather than do a roll up.  Don't mind the occasional yelling.  Part of the shtick."}
{"text":"Excellent falafel sandwich - they add some spice so even the regular was a little spicy - but it was super good  We did take out - the tables are communal and a little tight. Be sure to park in a lot before you to get to the shop - worth the trouble"}
{"text":"Small, unassuming place in a part of town that you probably don't go to, but make the trip. The all vegetarian menu does NOT disappoint.    Everything is prepped freshly for each order in front of you, Shanni is the best waitress ever, friendly customers striking up conversations with other customers over how good the food is.    We really enjoyed our visit and will absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Leur sandwich aux falafels est merveilleux! La salade de quinoa très bonne! La salade de carottes est ordinaire toutefois! Je recommande :)"}
{"text":"First timer; fresh off the plane.  Small local place that has a lot of pride (as they should!) in their terrific food. Would urge anyone to go there!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had the Tunisian salad on pita. Unfortunately they had no ciabatta left. The other people in my party had the falafel in pita. Everyone also enjoyed it. All around - definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Extraordinaire. Assiette falafel avec des salades variées et goûteuses, pain pita unique et que dire des falafel  en soit d'un fraîcheur rarement égalée. Expérience à refaire régulièrement. Un gros bravo."}
{"text":"Really flavourful and healthy vegetarian food for a reasonable price. For my full review, check out: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/when-vegetarian-food-tastes-this-good-you-wont-miss-the-meat/"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food. I love their Mongolian beef and shish taouk. The restaurant is small and tight but very cozy and staffs r very welcoming. Worth try!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem was a secret but I think it's about to be exposed...  Beyond tasty! Extremely authentic! Excellent customer service!  As a matter of fact, the only reason I heard of this place was because they catered an event for 40 people food was ridiculously good. I had to go in with my family. It's all vegetarian but they do some amazing things like General Tao frickin, Shawarma and so much more...  Definitely worth the parking situation, or lack thereof."}
{"text":"After hearing and seeing so many raved-about reviews of this place, we finally made it a point to stopover whilst on our way to the airport.  I have to say, I am soooo gutted that this place is super far for us South-Shorers. Honestly, it was any closer, I would be here at least once a week!!  The place was buzzing with a little line-up and everyone there seemed to be regulars, with their orders at the tip of their tongue. I however, didn't know where to start - having not expected such a variety of options, I could not decide on what to have! From Vegetarian General Tao, Shish Taouk, Shawarma and of course, the beloved Falafels and more - I had to make sure that it would be love at first bite! Finally, as I had been anticipating falafels all day, I played it safe and went for a Falafel Pita Sandwich with fries... ohh boy, was it heavenly! The pita was huuuge with lots of fresh crunchy salad and flavourful falafels all drizzled in a delicious tahini sauce... I didn't think I would be able to finish it but it was too good to put down!   The owners are super friendly, welcoming and chatty with a beautiful story which left both my husband and I feeling very impressed and hopeful.  Keep up the awesome work guys of creating love and unity through friendship, food & FALAFELS :)"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY !!!! IT'S ALL MINE LOL  One of the best spots in town, bar none. Delish, authentic, affordable, yadayada just don't tell them how good they are they might get too confident ;-)"}
{"text":"J'vais dire que je ne suis pas surprise que ce tout petit resto soit aussi populaire auprès de mes amis Yelpeurs. Non seulement est-ce que le bouffe est absolument fantastique, mais le service est très courtois et sympathique.  J'y ai été avec les suggestions de la caissière et elle ne m'a vraiment pas induit en erreur. Le pita de falafels, le pita de shawarma et 6 choix de salades froides. Tout végé et tout... trop bon!   Qui l'aurait cru qu'être végétarien (le temps d'un repas!) serait aussi goûteux et délicieux!  *Essayez les pâtisseries maison pendant que vous y êtes!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the shawarma hummus  plate and the falafel hummus plate. Service was quick and friendly. A little on the expensive side. The place is tiny and doesn't have great seating arrangements. Will return for the falafels as they are spot on. Didn't really enjoy the shawarma."}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE FIND.  We were told about this place from someone who is related to the owner back in NY. We were soooooooooo happy we went. It was the best falafel I have had since my trip to Israel!  So many gluten free options. It was totally worth going out of our way to go. If you like this kind of food it is a must go."}
{"text":"The location is small and tight, and the parking situation isn't great, but it's worth the trouble. Very authentic Israeli style falafel and salads. Tasty, filling, and not over priced. The hot sauce is HOT so be careful. Everything seems fresh and made daily. Stay away from the coffee though, that's the only thing that I didn't enjoy. Service is friendly and quick, and they do take out as well. They serve only vegetarian foods, and they do everything right. I will be back there for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian shwarma! Delicious veggie chicken options made from mushrooms, veggie burgers also on the menu. Fantastic homemade pits, great looking fresh salads, and hot sauce that will blow your head off! Lots of sweets to choose from. Cute place, very friendly staff, great food. What more could you ask for? We got so carried away with all the veggie options we didn't have the falafels we came for! Next time. Oh, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been told numerous times how fortunate I am to live so close to this place (literally across the street) and decided to try it out. They offer enough types of salad/veg to please anyone, and even their want-to-be meat dishes are something I would be happy to eat. When you consider the fresh ingredients and portion size you are certainly getting a decent meal. The lemonade was delicious! Keep in mind what time you visit as the wait time was long and you're stuck lining up around the counter. The chefs were very kind throughout!   This would have been a 4 star review if there hadn't been hair baked into my food."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place, we were in the neighborhood. We were both so impressed with the quality and supreme freshness ! The freshest food I've had since i was in Cali ! I had the falafel with three salads - all the salads i tried were delicious.  Definitely worth trying !"}
{"text":"I have heard of this place a while ago.. never made it, until I able to.. I ordered the Falafel plate and yes! they were correct! the Falafel had a very good taste non like others! it tasted very unique and it was very full-filling and also their 2$ small latte is perfect! the service was amazing! friendly and quick! They let me try their vegan sweet and sour chicken and it tasted like real chicken! I told them I will go back and I will definitely go eat and try more foods! ps, if your vegan this is your spot!! enjoy"}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars for sure! This was one of the best falafel sandwich I have ever had. Salads are fresh and amazing. The location is random and small . This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a hidden jem in the least expected place. Often in this area for my son's hockey it was so very painful to find a good option for food. Along comes this place and everything changes. Now when I'm on the 20 going east or west I consider stopping to pick something up. The place is small and has a terrasse in the summer but reason to make it out is the great food. The fast and efficient service only make it a perfect place to pick up some great falafels. The salads and sides options are also great. It is a must if in the area or if you want some great falafels. Done. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Walking in I didn't expect much from a tiny falafel restaurant, but was I ever mistaken. I was greeting by the dude in the front, I told him I had never been here so what should I take and he brought me this delicious bundle of joy.  It was a falafel in a pita with all the fixings, red cabbage, turnip, I may have tasted some tabouli in there but damn was it ever delicious. The falafel itself was nice and flavourful, and the pita it was in was soft and really complimented the falafel perfectly!!! I have never had a falafel like that in my life. It total it was about 9 bucks with a water bottle which was fare, in just sad I hadn't taken another one lol, I'm glad I stopped by this small shop and I will definite be back! Ohhhh and the gentleman made me try these potato latkes, wow!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was outstanding. I had the falafel pita. It was perfect but almost to big to finish, but I did. The place is small but well organized."}
{"text":"I tried this place today and will surely be going back. Though the location is weird, there is tons of parking on the side streets around there. The place is small and cozy and the staff are very welcoming. I walked in there and got the feeling that everyone was a regular there. They display a wide variety of salads and dishes that all looked amazing. I had the falafel pita all dressed medium spicy (which was spicy enough for me) and a small order of ginger \"chicken\". The falafel was incredible and was a great value. The \"chicken\" was a little bit expensive ($7 for a small container) but it was delicious, tasted just like chicken and was surprisingly very filling. I will definitely be going back there soon."}
{"text":"Ou plutôt 3.5/5 pour être exact! En tant que végane (et définitivement fan de hummus et de falafels!), j'attendais beaucoup de ma visite chez Falafel St. Jacques. Au final, je dois avouer que j'en suis ressorti assez mitigé.  Avant tout, gardez en tête que le restaurant est davantage adapté pour les commandes à emporter plutôt qu'à manger sur place. L'endroit est très petit et ne contient qu'une poignée de places assises. D'ailleurs, même si vous arrivez à vous asseoir, vous ne parviendrez peut-être pas à pleinement profiter de votre repas: aux heures de pointe, les clients peuvent se retrouver les uns par-dessus les autres. En plus, les \"cris\" du personnel (autant en cuisine qu'au comptoir) contribuent à créer une ambiance assez chaotique. En fait, on se sent assez bousculé. L'homme qui a pris ma commande écoutais à peine ce que je disais et me semblait très pressé de passer au client suivant. Idem lors du choix des salades pour accompagner mon plat et de la réception de la commande. Cela dit, lorsqu'il fait beau, une terrasse adjacente est aussi accessible aux clients. Au moins, on y est au calme!  Une fois qu'on parvient enfin à mettre la main sur sa commande, par contre, l'expérience s'améliore! Les imitations de viande sont réussies, le pain pita (fait maison!) est moelleux et les falafels sont frais. Le hummus, trop liquide, était la seule préparation qui laissait à désirer. Les portions sont plus que généreuses (surtout pour le prix!): sauf cas de grosse faim, amenez votre contenant pour ramener les restes à la maison! Pour les amateurs de shish taouk, gardez en tête que Falafal St. Jacques sert de la cuisine israélienne: il n'y a donc pas de sauce à l'ail! La personne qui vous accompagne sera contente. ;) Dans tous les cas, je vous recommande de prendre une assiette plutôt qu'un sandwich: vous aurez alors le choix entre des frites ou 3 salades. Préparez-vous toutefois à ce qu'il y ait de la confusion lors du choix des salades: elles ne sont pas étiquetées et, avec le bruit ambiant, le personnel aura de la difficulté à entendre vos questions et/ou vos choix.  Au final, j'ai été déçu du service et de l'ambiance mais ai apprécié la bouffe. Ça n'a pas aidé que l'employé qui a pris ma commande ne connaissait pas la définition du véganisme et n'était pas toujours en mesure de me dire si tel ou tel plat, salade ou dessert contenait des ufs et/ou des produits laitiers. Il a même crié à tous que les brownies était végétaliens alors que, après vérification, ce n'était pas le cas. Si vous êtes végane ou désirez simplement éviter les produits d'origine animale pour des raisons de santé, faites attention et soyez clair. Évitez le sandwich Sabich et la salade de pommes de terre (même si le restaurant commence progressivement à utiliser de la mayonnaise végane). Aussi, contrairement à ce qui est souvent publicisé, le restaurant n'est pas 100% végétarien puisqu'un sandwich (le Tunisien) et une salade contiennent du thon.  Bref, je ne crois pas que Falafel St. Jacques vaille absolument le détour (surtout que c'est assez excentré) mais c'est définitivement un arrêt intéressant si vous passez dans le coin!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone is making a big deal about this place ,it's just a falafel :) well it's fresh but sandwiches they make is disgusting ,so called pita bread they use is soooo thick but there is a reason for that because first they put in the falafel along with anything they find plus the sauce sandwich becomes like a balloon after the first bite your face hands fingers become greasy and disgusting . Plus restaurant it self  is so small they have this long table in the middle of the restaurant and they stuff like 100 customers  in there you can't breathe , I was sitting with my wife and there is absoulutly no gap with the person sitting next to me it's like we are sitting shoulder to shoulder . After we left our jackets , shirts even our hair smelled Like greesy food."}
{"text":"Falafel pita is $5.99. The lady with whom you order and pay is sweet and patient and helpful. Then you proceed down the line to the guy who makes your sandwich. The falafel are fresh...I mean, he stopped the line to scoop more dough balls into the fryalator, so I literally got mine seconds after cooking."}
{"text":"We picked up falafel wrap on our way back from Montreal and it was a pleasant surprise . Falafels were yummy and would definitely return again on our way to and from Montreal next time."}
{"text":"fantastic flavors! I love the hummus and the tahini that are layered onto the vegan shish taouk and shawarma. I can't remember which plate was which, but I prefered the one that was less sweet. The side salads were also very tasty. I agree that the value of their plates was really good and we certainly can share 1 plate for two. I could understand why people drive out of the way to come for their falafels. This was a nice find :)"}
{"text":"The best falafel pitas in Montreal (in my opinion, but it would be hard to argue that it isn't at least the best in the South West part of the island) !! They're stuffed with lots of crunchy red cabbage, cucumbers and other veggie deliciousness, the falafels are a perfect mix of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and I'm literally in love with their garlic sauce and spicy sauce that they put in the pitas. Plus, the portions are HUGE (not just the pitas, but also their plates), I often can't finish my pita in one sitting, so it's perfect for lunch and an eventual afternoon snack ;)  Apart from the falafel pitas/plates, the salads are really tasty and fresh. They also sell baked goods, I have yet to try them but they look delicious. I have nothing negative to say about this place, the service is fast, the food is great and everything is vegetarian (yay), it's really amazing :)"}
{"text":"Delicieux falafel pita , many choices, tiny place but very busy, fast and friendly. I like it !"}
{"text":"Best Falafel in town, home made pita, sauce and delicious golden gems. Great ME baked good too! Go get ya some!"}
{"text":"Holy cannoli this is some amazing veggie fare. I had not had the pleasure of enjoying veggie shishtaouk or shawarma until visiting these guys and I wasn't disappointed. As other folks have mentioned, the portions are generous, fresh and delicious. In fact, this is one of the few times I've seen my boyfriend not be able to finish his meal (due to size, of course.) Everything was also quite cheap, with the exception of the pastries (but let me tell you, those $7 cookies were damn worth it!)  It would be amazing if they could accommodate more seating, particularly because it's clear that people come in from all over town for their noms, but I reckon once their little patio space opens up again it won't be so tight in there."}
