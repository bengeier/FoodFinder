{"text":"TWE's Sub is tucked away in an office area. You wouldn't know it existed unless you work nearby, like I do.   After a stressful morning at work and a week of dieting, I decided, as I drove by the \"Now Open\" sign, that today was spontaneous cheat day. Turns out today was also their grand opening day!   Parking is a pain in the butt. The stalls are tight and all but 3 are reserved. You'll be lucky if you can find a spot.   Expecting it to be a take-out establishment, I was pleasantly surprised that despite the name, TWE's Sub is actually a full, dine-in Vietnamese restaurant with reasonable prices. They're also vegetarian friendly.   I ordered the chicken sate sub to go. All their subs are $6.99. The staff are friendly and know the menu well. They informed me about their sub combo deals ($9.99, $10.99) which comes with pop and a choice of either spring rolls, salad rolls or wonton soup. Remembering my diet, I passed on the upgrade (gotta have *some* self control, eh?)   I got my sub in no time, opened the wrappings at my office like a Christmas present and tucked in.   The ingredients were fresh, baguette was perfectly toasted, portions were generous, but flavour was lackluster. I've spent a lifetime eating Vietnamese subs and I wasn't wowed by this one. The sate sauce was weak, and wasn't spicy at all. The only surprise was they added crushed, toasted peanuts which I found to be a nice touch. Nevertheless, I was quite full after devouring the entire thing.   TWE's Sub gets brownie points for a valiant first day effort. I'm willing to give them another try for the dine-in experience. I'll let you know how that turns out on my next cheat day."}
{"text":"Worthwhile if you're in the area, but not worth a trip.  Pros: Fast service -- I ordered a combo with a banh mi and a salad roll, and had the salad roll within a minute and the sandwich in a few. Inexpensive -- sandwiches are $7 and the sandwich combo that I ordered (which also included a pop) was $10. My banh mi was reasonably tasty, and was served on a bun that had a bit of crunch but wasn't too crusty.  Cons: The banh mi was quite skimpy on the meat -- it had maybe a third to half as much meat as I would have liked. The salad roll didn't come with much sauce.  I work in the area so I'll be back, but I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Stopped in one day to check out TWE's Sub.  There's really not much to write home about here.  Their pho, we'll, I've had better.  The ingredients all seemed fresh and their bowls were huge, except it was all very bland.  The service was fine, the staff/owners are very friendly.  I noticed they had some sort of dining area set up behind the counter for them to lounge in which was a bit strange.  I maybe will try their subs next time and see if that would warrant a better rating."}
