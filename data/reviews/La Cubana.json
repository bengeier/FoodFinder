{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place after seeing it on \"You Gotta Eat Here\". I finally made it for lunch last week and it was pretty good. Actually the GUAVA BBQ SHORTRIB MEDIANOCHE was amazing! the YUCA FRITA, SWEET PLANTAIN and HOUSE BREW BEER were just okay. But the Medianoche made up for it... it was absolutely delicious. I can't stop thinking about it. I also tried the donuts for dessert. They were good but not fantastic. 

The atmosphere was cute - like a beach diner. The outdoor patio in the back looked great but it was full when I went. 

If you're on the fence, just go. The Shortrib Medianoche is worth it - go just for that. So good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad.... It is not authentic Cuban food. I do not recommend the drinks to anybody, the drinks are expensive and you don't even get a full glass. Plus, the drinks took forever to arrive to the table!!!
The food is something else. The rice & beans is not Cuban, it doesn't have that delicious Cuban taste. I asked for a toast to eat the eggs with, and they just said no because they need the bread to make sandwiches! I am paying, just bring me the bread!!! 
The service is horrible! It looks like they just don't care, I know the place is new, but at least they should know about customer service!
We were a group of 4 Cuban girls, and never coming back!"}
{"text":"I liked their backyard patio, and the sandwiches were good,  but the value wasn't there.  They don't give you much beyond a basic sandwich. I would return if a family  or friend was interested in trying it, but I wouldn't drag anyone back."}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience. Don't miss the Cuban sandwich. Crispy goodness. The fried squid is another one you shouldn't pass up - nice balance with some heat. The short rib and the pork were both good, but the chicken was under seasoned. The drinks were meh - none of the four cocktails we tried stood out for me. Dessert  was remarkable - fresh, warm, cinnamony donuts were a hit. As was the lime pie. The pineapple upside down cake would have benefited from being served warm. Cool vibe and service was excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuuuum. Finally had the chance to grab dinner at La Cubana on a Wedensday night. It was busy, but because we were two, my friend and I were seated immediately at the bar. Our server came over immediately with water, and to take our drink orders. We had a few questions about the menu/recommendations, which he was very helpful with. 
I got the Veggie Medianoche with a side of Sweet Plantains (servers suggestion), and my dining partner had the Short Ribs Plate. 
OMG. The plantains are TO DIE FOR. So many times I have had plantains that are cut too thin, and just a chewy whatever meh dish. These were PERFECT. With a side of housemade hot sauce, these were a dream. Get them. Get the plantains. 

The Veggie Medianoche was also a really delicious sandwich. The bun was just the right balance of fluffy/dense/soft/crispy, and all of the sammy ingredients were expertly balanced in proportion/thickness etc. 

I can't speak to the ribs, but my friend said that they were delicious.

In house beer was decent. Service was great. Decor is stunning. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Despite SOME negatives, I have to give this place 5 stars because I continue to come back here time and time again and the food is ALWAYS good. 

Let me start with ONE negative... and the only reason why I'm even pointing this out is that I used to work in the the restaurant industry (6+ yrs) and not much bothers me because I know what shitty stuff servers have to go through from customers and it's HARD. but when you tell your server you're ready to order food and she tells you \"i'm not ready to take your order\" and abruptly walks away (after having JUST taken your drink order) that rubs me the wrong way. i understand, she probably needed to get to another table, or needed to time her orders, but no need to leave our table without a proper explanation.

ANYWAY the food here is fantastic. we keep coming back here for the squid appetizer which is the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. the empanadas are to die for (but i'm used to bigger portions) and for $15, the large plates are crammed with food. the rib plate is so juicy and flavourful, and it comes with the perfect amount of rice, plantains, and coleslaw. i tried the medianoche sandwich once and it is stacked with ingredients so i came out feeling absolutely stuffed (in a good way). 

i have yet to try more roncesvalles resto's since it is a great street for food, but sometimes i feel i don't need to when i love this place sooo so much."}
{"text":"My first visit after hearing many positive notes on this place. I had the grilled fish with beans and rice. The fish was a tilapia and was done just right, fresh and flaky. Topped with pineapple and cilantro.  I went on a Sunday around 4pm and was not busy at all.  I will be coming back for brunch which ends at 3pm and a slightly different menu."}
{"text":"Super cute interior with counter service. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. 
No platanos maduros???"}
{"text":"I ate at La Cubana Ossington with a group of six that needed to grab a quick meal. For what it's worth, I can confidently say the food here is a different species than Cuban resort food, and 200% better.

The room is bright and tiled, like a vaguely art deco cafeteria. You order off a concise menu, take a number and wait at a table. Our orders came fairly quickly, and within a few minutes of each other, despite the size of the group. It's not set up for groups of more than four - the trays our food came on had to be discarded to give everyone space to eat. 

You can order plates or sandwiches. The former comes with sides, which can also be ordered separately. The plates were large and filling, mostly based around pork or chicken, although there was a vegetarian option on the menu. I had the achiote roasted chicken plate - the meat was juicy, and the beans were flavorful. The vinaigrette on the coleslaw was a nice contrast to the rich and slightly salty chicken skin, although the plantain was starchy and bland. 

At $15 the plates seem like good value - most of our group opted for them, and they were all cleaned. However, we did leave behind half a pressed Cubana sandwich that looked a little sad. I'd go here again for a casual lunch or dinner, but probably wouldn't bring my vegetarian mother-in-law."}
{"text":"Shopping near one of the most 'stylish' neighborhoods coined by the prestigious Vogue magazine in freezing weather will definitely conjure up some serious cravings for comfort food which can be rectified by a visit at La Cubana.  

La Cubana definitely fits into this cool block with the vintage diner decor.   My friend ordered a vegetarian cuban plate and I myself had an Achiote Roasted Chicken Cuban Plate.  
Although i didn't get to try the vegetarian plate, the speed and efficiency my friend devoured the dish clearly indicated how delicious the dish (and i guess hungry?)was.   I really enjoyed my roasted chicken which was tender, moist, and basted with a bit of butter for extra flavour.   The rice and beans were also addictive- after finishing the portion your mind tells you that you are full but your taste buds argue otherwise for more.   Just a few things I would pick on: 
1.the dishes weren't warm when they were served which would have been nice considering the cold weather.  
2. a tad pricey i think for lunch ($20.00) given the casual atmosphere with no drinks."}
{"text":"Clean Diner style interior, great look. Kid friendly menu.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Went for Brunch, had the hash and pork. Portions were good, food was rather bland. Will try it again for dinner."}
{"text":"Love the Chorizo Medianoche, BUT this new 5% take-out surcharge they stick on your bill is unacceptable. All restaurants have the expense of take-out containers, which is balanced by customers not using up seats and dishes not having to be washed. Get rid of it. In order to circumvent the surcharge, I reduce my tip by 5%, which is pretty unfair to the server."}
{"text":"Really tasty Cubano sandwich.  Zero good vibes, nobody seemed happy to be working.  Had to sit and wait unspoken to for way too long with staff all around me. Poor execution on so many levels.  
The sandwich was so good though! 
The place had no soul on this particular day."}
{"text":"Second time here in the past 6 months and I will continue to return here. It's a smaller place but in the summer has a patio out back that can seat plenty. Try everything on the menu, everything
Except the plates are under $10. The drinks are fantastic and the coffee is even better. The staff is friendly and attentive without being annoying. A little taste of Havana in Toronto."}
{"text":"I only got a sandwich to go but the space is cute (with a patio out back), the staff were friendly and helpful and the sandwich I had was delicious. One of the best in the city!  

I had the traditional medianoche - pork and ham with gruyere cheese melted over it on a homemade bun with Dijon and a delicious sauce. So good. 

Can't wait to go back and check out the rest of the menu. This is going to be a regular place to visit. I can feel it.

UPDATE: We tried to pop in for brunch on the weekend. The one staff member we were greeted by was really snotty and rude about the wait time - not helpful at all and not forthcoming with any information. It was a real turn off and we went for brunch elsewhere. 

I'd be willing to give them another shot since my first sandwich was so great but if that was my first experience there is no way I would go back."}
{"text":"First off let me preface that I'm from Florida, I can speak Spanish semi-fluently, and I have a Cuban sister.

That being said, I was let down by La Cubana. The decor, feel and smell were all there. However, the taste just wasn't. It was lacking something that I can't describe any better than simply saying, authenticity.

Let me not be too harsh. If this is your first time having Cuban food then this is a fair comparison to the real thing.

I recommend the pressed sandwiches, I believe I had the pork shoulder option."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and the staff care about your enjoyment. They keep it very clean and comfortable with a great seating area at the bacm. Only lost a star because they don't have the full menu of the la cubana on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for lunch on the weekend, our day was going very well until we made the decision to eat at this restaurant. We both ordered the pulled pork plate with rice and beans. My plate looked great, but my daughter's pulled pork was just all fat. She went up to ask if they could change it and the waiter came back to let us know they would not fix it, and that she should order something else. I was really surprised to hear this and found it really arrogant. I was so disappointed with the experience that I will never ever go back to this restaurant. I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way, as the reason we ended up there was because all the other restaurants around were full and had lineups, but this restaurant had room a plenty...."}
{"text":"Got takeout for lunch today. Had a beer while we waited. Everything was delicious! The dark beer super yum. My only complaint was the heart of palm in the salad tasted like it was from a can. It's so easy to rinse it and get rid of that flavour, I don't know why restos never bother. PS servers were great and kudos for all women in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"This was easily the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life. The mixed drinks taste only of straight rum. I ordered the honey glazed pork belly medianoche sandwich which consisted of pure fat in which the fat soaked in to the bun. I literally want to puke now after two bites. Needless to say I only took those two discusting bites. The only reason I am giving one star is the empanadas were decent, and the mussels were average and the BBQ short ribs were actually pretty good.
Service was very poor. We waited an hour for a table, then they texted us to say our table was ready. When we went in, we were told it wasn't ready, then was ignored for ten minutes. Men's bathroom had no soap and no paper towel.
Seriously, DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the food is atrocious, and the drinks are made with absolutely no knowledge of how to mix drinks. I will never return, not even if you paid me and covered the cost of the meal. Absolutely disgusting! The owner should be ashamed."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Super friendly service with a real family feel to it. Not overly fancy in terms of decor but they focus heavily on great food and service which is all that matters in my opinion. 

My favorite thing is to sit at the bar and watch the kitchen staff and will often ask them questions about the food and even though they are clearly very busy they are always friendly and informative."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for a friend's birthday lunch.  This restaurant was highly recommended from many others through word of mouth.  So tried it we did.  It lived up to all the hoopla. The grilled coconut shrimp, fried squid. So good. And then we all had our own individual sandwiches or plate.  I had the guava braised beef sandwich. It was perfect. Hit the spot. It was quite busy there which is always a good sign too! The server was great and we had no issues. The whole experience was a good one."}
{"text":"My experience was not so memorable, the waitress with an attitude saying that my sleeping daughter in her stroller was in her way. Second we all get served and they forget one dish and she comes back again asking what dish was missing and third when the bill comes we get charged two tables in one. I'm not coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Nice 70's feel to the diner, with great attentive service. 
Ordered the Fish (tilapia) (approx. $15)which was cooked perfectly with a nice simple flavor.  Also had the Cuban sandwich ($8) with no sides.  Came out piping hot with melted cheese and thinly slice tender meat.  Overall, the food was excellent, especially for the reasonable price. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First off, I read all the negative reviews below and have to completely agree that the service here is straight up shit. I'd also like to add that my sister and I work in the restaurant industry and we don't normally have bad experiences because we're pretty understanding. This is actually our first yelp review because it was truly a bad experience that we thought other people should be warned about.

I came here this evening with my sister, excited to show her this great place. Previously I dined here for lunch and had a pleasant experience. Tonight, it was busy and you could tell all 4 servers were flustered. After a few minutes we sat at a cramped table and were ignored for a good 10 minutes. We placed our drink orders with one server, 5 minutes later another came over and asked if we wanted drinks. We politely told her we already placed our order with another server assuming that's how they get their tables..she said ok fine and walked away. After our drinks arrived, that server took off without asking if we were ready to order and we never saw her again. After waiting another 10 minutes, and making eye contact several times with these servers, I finally just said \"ok we are ready to order\" to one of them within ear shot.

Ok so then the food came and all is good because it's pretty damn good and the reason I came back. However, the server never came by and asked how it was. Not a huge deal because it's good, but working in the restaurant industry we both feel like she didn't give much of a shit. 

We ordered dessert and before even finishing our dessert and drinks (WE COULD HAVE ORDERED MORE) our bill was planted on the table with no discussion. I looked up at her and said \"actually it's separate bills\" to which she replied \"oh it's too late now. You had to tell me before because our computer can't split it now.\" It's not a usual practice to walk in to a restaurant and announce it's separate bills. 

OK, however if we had finished eating or if you just ASKED we would have never had the following issue. Also, I'm sorry but don't just assume it's always together. It takes two seconds to ask...and we weren't even done our meal. We planned on getting another drink but whatever.

Ok, so she runs to go get the calculator because she couldn't figure out the math in her head. Meanwhile, my sister and I divided the bill in our heads pre-tax. So we did that, and to be honest...I was tired and not really paying attention to tax. So we told her what the subtotal was when she came back with the calculator. Then she didn't bother using it and she didn't add the tax to the separate subtotals. So instead of including tax or adding it up like a server should to ensure it's correct before you pay, she just punched in the subtotal. We both tipped on the subtotal amounts, got up and left not realizing tax wasn't included...because really we both were not paying attention. This is not our job. 

Walked out the door and halfway down the block I hear a server yell \"girls!\" (condescending I'm probably the same age or older than her) We came back, and she said \"I think you might be short\" seeming very unsure of her statement. I said \"short? short on what\" because I paid and had no clue what she was talking about. She wasn't very sure so said wait here while I go check again. Meanwhile, I might add this was not the server we had. She came back and said \"ya I think you're short\" still unsure.

So we go back in. Then we talk to the third server there. We all realize tax wasn't included so decided to figure that out. The server couldn't figure out how to do the tax on the separate bills because the bill was still technically 1 bill. Luckily, I know basic math, so she handed me the calculator and I did it for her. We figured out that I owed .34 cents and my sister nothing (we didn't tip great as you can tell because guess what..the service sucked!)

Anyways, to wrap up this review, the server said \"it's fine\" and I didn't have to settle and we agreed that other server would just get no tip. She said this wouldn't have happened if we just told them ahead that we wanted separate bills (???). She gave us attitude and made this our fault, continually saying \"it's fine\" (in a rude tone) but never sorry or apologizing. So basically, I recommend take out. The servers don't know what they're doing or basic customer service, math, or generally being nice people. Pretty disappointing, will never return. 

Note to the owner - train your staff in how to deal with issues like this and how to be respectful and apologetic to guests. Guest recovery makes or breaks an experience and ours was broken completely. I'm actually quite bummed this happened, I have never had such a perplexing experience in customer service."}
{"text":"For full disclosure, I haven't been to Cuba. But I have been to La Cubana. And after one visit, I'm convinced it's the closest experience to authentic Cuban food I'll have until I get on a plane.

La Cubana is located in the High Park/Roncesvalles village. The area is known for its Polish community, but ironically, this Cuban restaurant is sweeping up local patrons by storm. Be careful though, if you're looking for Cuban cuisine in the Roncesvalles village, you can easily walk by La Cubana without noticing: they don't have a big, bright sign, just the name on the door.

When I walked into the restaurant I felt like I passed through a time warp. I was back in the 1950's, at a diner in Miami. With pastel green-coloured walls and mambo music in the background, I had to fight the urge to shake a hip or two on my way to the table.

Looking over the menu you'll want to order everything, it all sounds AMAZING!  We compromised and ordered what caught our eyes, along with a few recommendations from our friendly server.

We started with the Bean & Cheese Empanadas ($7), Habanero Glazed Fried Squid ($7) and Guava Short Rib ($8). Honestly, everything tasted like a slice of Cuban heaven. The empanadas were crispy and packed full of cheesy gooeyness; the squid had a killer spicy/sweet kick; and the short rib was pure fall-off-the-bone goodness.

After devouring those plates, we decided to share the Pineapple Glazed Pork Belly Medianoches ($8) and the Grilled Fish with Pineapple Salsa ($15), and a side of Yuca Frita ($4).  A medianoche is a sweet milk bun, similar to Chinese bakery buns filled with BBQ Pork.

If you thought that was it, think again: I never ever skip dessert, it's as important as breakfast!

We asked the server what her favourite dessert was, and she recommended getting the donuts ($5) and to dip them in the Cuban Coffee Natilla ($5) - mind blown!  It was the perfect end to an incredible Cuban dinner.

Overall, my experience at La Cubana was amazing.  The food was full of flavour, the service was on point, and the décor/atmosphere really made me feel like I was in Miami (because I have no idea what Cuba is really like).  I plan on coming back soon and letting my inner fat kid run wild, possibly for their brunch.

{"text":"This place was on my list of places to try for a while. My friend and I loved everything we ate. We had grilled corn,a chorizo empanada, a bbq shortrib sandwich and a pulled pork entree. I tried the guava fizz drink and it was refreshing, and we had key lime pie and donuts for dessert.

I would say the flavours and dishes are lovely. Our only complaint might be the size of dishes. For example, the empanada comes only as 1 empanada, even though it is plural on the menu. But everything is so well crafted it is understandable that the dishes are small, or even 'properly portioned' one might say. I just think you should know it before going. You will probably order many dishes!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Went with 2 kids under 4 and my wife and they service was great as well. Really looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The Cuban plates here are delicious, and really filling! Great mix of rice, beans, veggies and meat! The pork belly is definitely worth splurging over. Good for eating in and also take-out. The restaurant has a cute, old-school vibe with pretty tiled floors!"}
{"text":"Really did not enjoy. Got the grilled shrimp plate (15$) and the shrimp was burnt and spicy (after I had asked if it was spicy and she said no). Overall this place had split reviews at my table, 2 loved it and 2 (including me) hated it.. Maybe I would've liked their traditional sandwich but based off of this meal I would not try it again. 

Also our food took a really long time to come and after we got our meals our waiter was put on another section so we had no service for the rest of the meal and had to find someone for the bill .. No one checked on us or asked if we wanted desert or anything else.. 

Overall try it for yourself, but this was not for me."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience going to this eatery. The mojitos are especially delicious and every server I ever had have been nothing short of wonderful. Their sandwiches are also delightful."}
{"text":"I have only visited La Cubana once. Had the Medianoche sandwich from their brunch menu and my companion had the Cuban sandwich. Great service and great food I will be returning in the future. Hopefully they will some day open a location closer to down town."}
{"text":"I love this place! The cubana coffee is the best! The food is good and the people are great and it's a really nice atmosphere with 50s diner style and backyard patio. I definitely want to become a regular at this place:)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Immediately transports you to Calle Ocho in Miami. I love the details they put into their restaurant.  It is so bright and fun...like Cubans themselves!

Food and Drinks: This was my first time in this location but I still went with my favourite dish in the restaurant which would be the Guava rib plate (with yuca fries on the side because they are a MUST). I recommend you try out the Guava fizz. It is like summer in your mouth. The actual plate is just phenomenal. The rice and beans are underrated but as a rice fanatic I can vouch for this being the best rice and beans I've probably ever had. The short rib melts in your mouth and is nicely balanced with patacones (fried green plantains) and a pickled red cabbage slaw. This is by far one of my favourite restaurants in the city! Their flavours are delicious and their portions are how latin portions should be (not tapas style that's for sure).

Service: Service is 10 times better here than it is in their Roncesvalles location. The food came in less than 15 minutes and we felt well taken care of."}
{"text":"I came for brunch on Saturday with some friends. The decor style is kind of retro diner, but with lots of pastel colors. The staff were very courteous and professional.

We started with the donuts, which were piping hot and perfectly covered with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. I ordered the pork belly with pineapple glaze and eggs. The pork belly was roasted so tender that the layers of meat fell off one another, yet the skin was still crispy. It was heavenly. The sides didn't let the pork belly steal the spotlight though. The portions were generous and the varied textures between the rice & beans, slaw (kind of spicy), and tostones made for a powerful brunch combination. 

I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting!!! First, I am Cuban and this is not even close to Cuban food at all!!! I mean you can still eat it but is not Cuban. I was very disappointing!! Service is veryyyyy slow!!! Drinks were expensive and they do not use Cuban rum, not Cuban rum! The food tasted microwaved!! Definitely not going back. The place did not have the warmth of a Cuban place! Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I had the brunch and it was amazing! The latte was great, and the french toast was awesome. The service was great, and I loved how they left the water on the table. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in the hip Trinity Bellwood area, walking into La Cubana with the teal blue tile and diner seats makes me feel nostalgic for my travels to Cuba. I tried their signature Pressed Cubano Sandwich and it did not disappoint me. It was fresh off the press and pipping hot. This sandwich is the best hangover cure with a good cup of Cubano coffee."}
{"text":"Wife and I dropped by late Saturday afternoon. The restaurant isn't large and can fill quickly. We opted to be seated straight away at the bar area overlooking the small diner style kitchen. 

Loved watching both chefs move fluidly around each other never seeming to have a moments break. Alot of attention to each dish and without taking a bite, we could see our meal was going to be delicious. 

We ordered Chorizo Empanadas ($7) and the Habanero glazed fried squid ($8)for starters. No complaints.  Small portions but enough to make you lick your lips for the main.

We chose the Molasses roasted pork shoulder ($15) and the Guava BBQ beef short ribs ($15). Again we watched both dishes prepared and thoroughly enjoyed the show! Both dishes were outstanding. The meat was soft and tender and the accompanying rice and red cabbage slaw fit perfectly.  The portions were the right side of generous but not too much. We more or less licked our plates clean. 

The two staff members who ran the tables before 6 were fabulous.  Great interaction and always kept an eye on drinks. More staff arrived at 6pm as the restaurant went into full speed from that point. 

We loved the bar seats and felt we got a dinner and a show! Highly recommend this place and the bar seats if you are a fan of how the kitchen runs!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, service was average the atmosphere nice. I just can't believe how Infeasted they are with fruit flies. I couldn't stop swatting long enough to enjoy my lunch. That's a really bad situation for a food service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner on the patio the other night.  We started with the habanero fried squid, which was a little soggy, but it did have a nice flavour.  For mains, I had the pressed cubano sandwich, and my wife had the fish sandwich.  Both were okay, but lacked in flavour.  This was disappointing after having the squid.

Service was good."}
{"text":"I used to love the food before they altered their portion size. I also noticed that when I ordered take out, portions were even smaller! Not cool!!"}
{"text":"Update: La Cubana is now charging 50 cents for their little sides of hot sauce. SERIOUSLY? You are a Cuban restaurant - serving hot sauce is like serving ketchup. 

They have also significantly reduced the size of their homemade buns for sandwiches. 

Both these changes have seems to happen since the opening of the Ossington location. 
Giant franchise plans or not, let's stop with the pettiness and get on with the quality..."}
{"text":"It took us a while to get seated, but after that, the service was absolutely wonderful. Best mojitos in the city! And I can't get enough of their pineapple upside-down cake!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a large group of friends. The restaurant was recommended to us. We had a long wait which was okay as it was clearly busy. Once we were sat the service was quick and efficient, and very friendly. The food was okay, definitely not authentic Cuban. Our group ordered quite a few appetizers, which we all shared, and later discovered was our downfall. The next morning I received messages from friends claiming they had food poisoning, and shortly after I fell ill and spend all day asking myself why I ate there. I just checked DineSafe and discovered to my horror that a month ago they had a conditional pass due to a pest infestation and dirty surfaces. A quick scroll through their inspection reports shows they regularly fail to have clean surfaces."}
{"text":"Havana has come home to roost. La révolucion marked Cuba as a radical state, marooned from the colossal consumerist behemoth of Americana, freezing it's beauty like a perpetual cold-war era oasis. El Cubana offers uo a sliver of this marooned time with its phantasmagoric splendor. I consumed the Guava Bbq short ribs along with rice and beans, tostones (made with plantsin) and the creamiest slaw on the planet. It was a hate fuck for my diet but a mouth fuck for my taste buds. Get it. Get all of it. Love it."}
{"text":"Love the pork belly brunch, comes with the best fried egg I've had in my life. Great coffee."}
{"text":"Fun, cool looking place to try once.  A bit too pricey, the food is somewhat bland and way too many flies for me to ever
 return."}
{"text":"I've visited for brunch and dinner several times. Some of the best Cuban food I've had and the prices are really reasonable.

My favourite is the fish medianoche... Those buns are to die for! I always order the corn fritturas as well, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant, given I am Cuban and I love Cuban sandwiches, but I was so disappointed!
This place does not serve Cuban sandwiches at all. I tried the 'Medianoche' and I couldn't finish it......it wasn't terribly bad, it was just not a Medianoche as I know it and the taste was merely okay. My husband tried the 'cubano pressed' sandwich and it was better than mine, but still not a real Cuban sandwich.
We tried the 'chorizo empanadas', and hated it. It was only one (1) very expensive empanada and we did not see or taste the chorizo inside. 

Summary:  Never going back since there are other places that do make cuban sandwiches and are more affordable."}
{"text":"I just love the atmosphere and the very friendly staff. My partner and I have dined here on several occasions and were never let down on quality, speed of service, or value. I love their fish sandwiches. Their cocktails are also very satisfying. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend and a graphic designer for a late business meeting. We've decided to give this place a try and the only reason why I'm not giving it full stars is because I was still hungry after I've finished my meal.

I've order the Beef on a plate which is tender AF! Perfect seasoning and priced decently. Will go back if I'm looking for something light to eat. Keep up the good work peeps!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this gem on my way to Bang Bang... and I am glad I did. This was my first time trying Cuban food so I wasn't sure what to expect. All I can say is that it is delicious!! It was a cute narrow restaurant with a diner feel. It was well portioned and had a good balance of flavours."}
{"text":"Pretty damn tasty.  Ordered the fish and the chicken plates.  Both were moist, flavourful and complimented nicely with the slaw, rice, beans and plantain tostones. Attentive service, and the food came out quickly especially for a Saturday night.  Will definitely return for the crisp diner style decor and home style cooking."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went here on Saturday, already with critically low blood glucose levels and wanting to try their food because the interior looked nice. We got there at 3pm, and the rude waitresses kicked us out, saying that it's closed until 4pm for regular menu. That left a bitter taste in my mouth and we didn't go back. Their website doesn't state ANYWHERE that brunch ends at 3pm, closes for an hour, then opens at 4pm. The site says: Brunch 10am-3pm, Regular 3pm-10pm. Since when are therre unwritten rules? We came all the way to pay you people for food and we get kicked out? Good riddance, because the mediocre and overpriced food portions are miniscule that communist food looks like a buffet. I emailed them but nothing. Typical disgusting, condescending hipster attitude. Would never recommmend. 0/5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some take out (they don't accept phone in orders) Cubano sandwiches were incredible but I would not recommend the avocado salad it was $10 and had a wopping 4 slices of brown avocado with some arugula in an oil dressing. If youre a fan of some heat get the habanero mango hot sauce on the side its delicious."}
{"text":"The 5 stars say it all.... La cubana looks amazing, provides amazing service and most importantly, the food is INCREDIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been, nor have I any desire to go to Cuba. The travel posters make it look like a vibrant, exciting place with too many good looking people. Not my idea of a good time.

However, I have to see say I am thrilled to bits with Cuban food. All the personality and vigour of the nation itself, but with meat. That's why I was very interested when I was walking by La Cubana today and thought I'd give it a shot.

Usually the best item is at the top of the list, so I ordered a 'Pressed Cubano' to go. It's a delightfully toasty crunchy sandwich with pork, ham (not the same thing? Who knew!), Gruyere, pickles, red onion, mustard and mayo. Lots of messy ingredients, but damn if they don't hold together and make your day a little better. 

Sometimes I have trouble paying $10 for a sandwich, but baby, this is a $10 sandwich."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and had good but pricey meals. I feel the menu is built in such a way that forces you to order several extras for a full, however delicious,  meal. 

I will say that I had a great experience with the service the last time I was here. A blonde woman named Stella was very knowledgeable and extremely friendly and quick. I've worked in restaurants all my life and so I truly appreciate good service, which she graciously provided."}
{"text":"I ordered the Guava short rib and it was heavenly! A modest serving but packed full of flavour. I couldnt help myself after this and also ordered the conch fritters which were equally amazing. Great service - polite and efficient - and a very clean well maintained venue. Definitely coming back to make my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  The grill squid was nothing short of heavenly.

La Cubana's decor is fun, casual and welcoming.  Coupled with the amazing food and great service it was a perfect evening out."}
{"text":"Wait staff was friendly and helpful, but the food was lacklustre. I really wanted to like this place, but the food was rather plain. I'm giving it 3 stars only because the staff are so friendly."}
{"text":"Recently visited Roncesvalles from NYC and my airbnb host recommended this place. My friend and I were tired and hungry after a whole day of touring Toronto so we decided to head home and eat in the neighborhood. IT WAS AMAZING. I had the short rib platter and my friend had a vegetarian dish- we both loved it. We wanted to come back and have it again but it was closed for Christmas Eve and Christmas. We were very disappointed and are still searching for a good cuban place to match this one back in nyc. Add a beer to your meal- it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Great concept, great food, poor service. I have been to La Cubana 3 times (once for brunch). The food is inspired and made with care, as is the whole concept of the restaurant (Cuban diner). Unfortunately,  all three experiences have been met with poor service. 

From waiting 5 minutes before even being greeted (it's a small restaurant, just smile and acknowledge my presence), to uninformed wait staff, to not checking on my meal after it being served... As a restaunt owner, this is something I find inexcusable. 

I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, who has food allergies, and I went here for lunch and enjoyed one of the best meals that we have had in Toronto. The staff was extremely helpful in checking about ingredients, and the food was delicious...I had the pork shoulder plate and she had the short ribs. We are looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come to this new trendy restaurant after seeing the pictures my friend posted on Facebook that same day.. Sunday, August 17,2014

We got there 45min before the end of brunch and order 2 empanadas with a  pouch egg brunch special($14) and the pork belly pineapple with sunny side egg brunch special ($13) served with rice and bean and slaw and side of fry plantains ($4). Since we were not feeling water we order guava juice ($3) and mango colada..

The drink came very quickly  but the guava juice was water down with ice. The mango colada was great but for $5, I will have water instead...

Our food came quickly took picture of our exciting plates ... My pork belly was disappointing as it was like the last small crusty ends of the pork belly. Their was more pineapple than anything and amount of slaw on my plate was over whelming. It look like they use the slaw to make up a full meal. That's wasn't appetizing at all! There was no fat on my pork belly it was dry up like jerky! 


Than my husband went for his plate and found a piece of hair on his empanadas . He quickly order the waiter to take it back which he did and got a new plate which look like they toss the hairy empanada out and fill his plate back up with a new one with out adding extra one for the in convince... Customer service thumbs down! 

All in all for $50 with tip & tax for this brunch wasn't worth it... So much for trying out a new trendy place! I can make pouch eggs and rice and bean at home..."}
{"text":"The lighting is harsh after dark but the warm, friendly staff, good food and reasonable prices make up for it. The patio is a perfect place to enjoy a meal in warmer months. 

We ate the Habenaro Squid and loved it's sweet and hot flavours. The Bean and Cheese Empinadas were nice especially with the delicious house-made hot sauce. I would order both of these things again, for sure.  I'll take a pass on the Pressed Cubana sandwhich next time -- the buttery grilled bread with cheese was it's saving grace but the sandwich meat seemed processed and was not tasty. I picked it out and went crujido without carne.

Brunch here is excellent. Between my own dish and the sharing I did with friends and family I've tried the chorizo empanada - amazing, the baked eggs with sofrito and yuca - delicious, chorizo hash - spicy and yum, slow roasted pork and poached eggs - divine. The rice and beans, tostones, and corn firturas are all perfect side dishes. The breakfast cocktails are tasty but too $$$. Get there early for brunch or be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"This was a great casual dining experience. I had the short rib plate and donuts for dessert. I loved it. Great ambiance & tasty beverages as well. Very busy at lunch time so go a bit early. Definitely worth checking out. Contrary to what others have said, I found this location offers a better experience than the Ossington location. That said, both are great and worth the visit."}
{"text":"I love La Cubana. It's everything Roncesvalles needed: delicious food at a reasonable price with friendly servers.
Had I written this review back when the restaurant first opened, this would definitely be a 5 star rating. However, now that the restaurant has gotten really popular, the busyness has made it less enjoyable. It's hard to get a table at any time of day and the servers are noticeably stressed out, particularly during brunch. Being allergic to eggs, I had the audacity to ask the server a few questions about whether it would be worth it to order certain dishes egg-free or if I should just choose something else. She was visibly annoyed by my questions and gave very little information. I asked for more time to make a decision, which aggravated her further and caused some big sighs and impatient glares, so I just ordered the first thing I could see on the menu which well, you can guess, wasn't that great egg-free. Not the end of the world but not exactly pleasant.
For the most part though, La Cubana is a great place. I've been close to 5 times and always enjoyed the food and drinks. Hopefully they make a bit more effort in their customer service, it really makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Although they don't take reservations this is still one of my fave spots and somewhere I consistently go back to even though I don't live in the area (although this spot makes me wish I did)! 

For dinner we always order the small sharing plates (squid and mussles with the fried bread are some of my faves) and the key lime pie dessert is bomb.

For brunch I had the pork belly- it was very nice but not amazing...for that I'd get the french toast. Our table got a portion to share and ended up ordering another.

My favourite thing about this place is the atmosphere. Very relaxed and friendly. It isn't too cool for school, just chill and fun!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is simple and Cuban. The Black Bean Soup was absolutely fantastic and I ate some kind of cheese puff from my dinner mates that melted in your mouth along with a dipping sauce.  The Pressed Cubano sandwich and the Bean and Cheese Empanadas was good but lacked pizazz."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since I work in the neighbourhood and was quite excited since there's not much to eat in the area that's out of the ordinary. Been meaning to go to the ossington location but it's nice to see they're expanding. Tried to order via foodora for pick up however you can only do that for the roncesvalles location. 

Was probably one of the first few people coming in for lunch that day. Service isn't anything special and I felt that the price for the pressed cubano wasn't exactly worth it after tax and tip (~15) especially when it didn't come with any sides. Just 15 dollars for a pressed cubano. Would give 1/2 stars if I could but I guess I'd give it a 3-3.5."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed myself - I love the Roncey hood in general but had a few friends note this establishment. 
Myself and three other ladies shared both kinds of empanadas, the avocado salad, grilled coconut shrimp.

For my main I had the pineapple pork belly - I have a strong affinity for pork belly and this certainly did not disappoint. 

I love their drinks as well - typically rum and I are not bffs but cuba libres are fantastic. Maybe only a couple as the sugar something, something makes Homer go crazy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon,  service was friendly and fast. We ordered the pressed cubano and the cubana marinoche.  The cubana marinoche was great, but we've had better pressed Cubano in the past.   the ratio of ingredients to eachother was such that you could only taste butter and cheese. Would have preferred a more prominent pickle and mustard flavour.  It felt a little pricy for what it was."}
{"text":"Great food with a great atmosphere. I really liked this place, no fuss, no hype but a nice simple menu with tasty food. It's the basics of what good food should be! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Terrific food!  Servers were very professional, warm and helpful.  We were seated right away on a Wednesday night, although I've seen lineups there at other times.  Food was fresh, served quickly and dee-licious!  Cod croquettes were light and full of flavour.  In fact, all the fried dishes we enjoyed, including the fries and the ethereal donuts were surprisingly delicate, considering they were deep fried.  Great list of appetizers.  We wanted to try everything.  Mains were good, we loved the red cabbage that was served with the entrees.   Fish with pineapple was perfectly cooked and the salsa wasn't too cloyingly sweet.  The black bean soup was nicely balanced and they make a great bibb lettuce salad with hearts of palm, yum!  Only one drawback, which was my reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5.  For a table of six in the back area, we felt like we were in a medical examining room because the lights are way too bright.  Maybe some more ambient lighting for the evening crowd would be good and, also, I don't love seeing boxes of food (cans of coconut milk, etc) on the shelves.  Other than that, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've previously had Cuban food in Cuba (outside of the resorts), and in Hialeah, Miami, and La Cubana is much more accurately described as being 'Cuban Fusion' rather than \"authentic Cuban\" food.

My friend and I ordered the Pressed Cubano Sandwich, Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, Achiote Roasted Chicken, with two sides of Conch Fritters and Yuca Frita.

The Pressed Cubano, (a take on the classic Cuban sandwich), is made much too fancy for what is supposed to be a simple sandwich.  Normally, I love Gruyere cheese and grainy mustard, but those are two very strong flavours that just don't work with how this sandwich is intended.  Add to the fact, that it's not made with Cuban bread, I wouldn't recommend it.

On the flip side, the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder and Achiote Roasted Chicken plates, are excellent.  The rice and black beans and fresh slaw are extremely well-balanced and just a perfect compliment for the meats.  The red cabbage slaw is one of the best non-creamy-dressed slaws I've ever tasted.  I can't say enough about how deliciously complimentary these sides are.  The plantains are nice, but are seasoned with a tad too much salt.  But overall, these are two fantastic entrees.

Conch Fritters are absolutely a must-try.  Perfectly fried on the outside, tender on the inside, with a great mix of spices and green onion.  The yuca fritas are basically plantains, but thicker cut like fries, but here, they are unnecessarily slathered in a creamy garlic sauce.

Overall, this is a great place for a date, dinner with friends or family, etc.  It's a small menu, but it's made well and made quick.  Be warned, this is not an authentic Cuban cuisine experience, but the food execution is extremely well done."}
{"text":"Good LAWD this place was AMAZING. Husband and I went on a Monday night and there were only a couple other customers. Tried the black bean soup, the chicken plate with rice & beans, yuca frita, tostones and their donuts for dessert. Husband ordered the pork plate. All of it was, hands down, the best food we had while visiting Toronto. Finally, some FLAVOR! Staff was very quick and friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant was relaxing and calming. Seriously, look no further. Restaurants like this need to stay alive amidst the barrage of overpriced hipster joints with uncomfortable seating and small, bland portions."}
{"text":"I was starving when I arrived and had the Cuban sandwich. It was splendid. Really hit the spot. Service was friendly and vibe is relaxing."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late dinner a few weeks ago and had a great experience. Lovely service and tasty food. This new place in our neighbourhood showed lots of promise, so, with an out-of-town guest in tow, we returned. 

Unfortunately, our more recent experience was disappointing. Service was friendly  but unattentive. The mojitos were fine, not outstanding. Our avocado, orange and hearts of palm salads were tasty and fresh, but the lettuce needs to be torn a little smaller...it's difficult to eat with any grace. The conch frituras were balls of undercooked dough sitting in a nondescript sauce...we pulled them apart but couldn't find the conch. Almost as disappointing was the BBQ short rib dish. Mediocre. And not a rib to be seen. We'd planned to order more dishes when our other guest arrived, but decided against it because of the underwhelming food and service.

I hope La Cubana was just having an off night...we want to support this place. But for $100, we expect more. We'll hold off until we see a few more positive reviews."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Roncey! The service, atmosphere and vibe are all fantastic. Haven't been lucky enough to get on the patio yet as it's always jam packed. The fish dish is incredible, great combo of flavours and textures, and is very filling."}
{"text":"The food is plain but that is what the cuisine calls for.  Honest food at honest prices in a cheerfully honest setting."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've had in a long time!!  We stopped by and were cheerfully greeted right away. We ordered two pressed cubanos and an order of fries to take out. The order came up within a few minutes and was packed-up and handed over with a smile. Coming back soon!! Thanks La Cubana, keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Sorta bullshit restaurant. The food was not impressive and the service was poor. Things delivered to wrong tables, rudely correcting how to pronounce spanish words, just generally annoying. 

Also, I ordered a chicken sandwich which was served cold. I asked \"this is supposed be cold, right?\" \"Yes\" But there were grill marks on the bread. \"When did you toast the bread?\" \"Earlier today, then we put it together when you order it\". Old toast. Cool.

I loved the design and layout of the interior, though."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio area and ordered Cuban plates of pork,green plantain,rice and slaw . The staff were friendly and the restaurant is nicely decorated, the food arrived quickly and was good but not anything special ,I would say average compared to Cuban food I've eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pressed Cubano is as close as you can get to a Cuban Sandwich in Toronto. It's not made with Cuban bread but is still delicious. As a Cuban from Miami it reminds me of home. 

They also serve cold beer."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff and very nice decor!

The guava pork sandwich was incredible! will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went during Brunch on Saturday, the entire menu was not available. What i ordered tasty but not unique,"}
{"text":"Well priced dishes.  Cafeteria style - order at the counter and pre-pay.  Always delicious, mouthwatering medianoches and other wonderful sandwiches.  Say yes to La Cubana!"}
{"text":"I like the Short Rib Dinner Plate here. It's decent for one of those days you want some roast beef, but too lazy to cook a whole chuck yourself. The tostones would have been awesome if there's some extra sauce to eat it with. I tried the chicken, and it was too dry for me. I heard the pressed sandwiches are good, but couldn't really justify paying for what look like toasties at a sit down restaurant (maybe if this were a food truck?)

I've had better Cuban food down in the States, but this is quite decent for a place this far north. I know that it's not authentic, but I quite like the atmosphere of this little place. Plus, this place opens quite late."}
{"text":"The service here is good. Friendly. The food is ok. I don't get the fuss. We had the pressed cubano sandwich and the guava bbq short ribs. The former was ok nothing special the latter slightly better- but still i mean for a $9 sandwich you should expect better. It was ok. The short ribs were salty. We had the yuca frita- meh. For desert we had the key lime pie (it was ok- small though). The food is overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"La Cubana offers an uncomplicated menu.
I would say it is reasonably  priced compared to other restaurants on the strip.
I had the press Cubano sandwich $9. I'm
almost positive it was grilled with half a block of butter .., it was delicious.

My companion had the short rib $15 which was also very tasty. The meat was tender and the rice and beans were perfectly seasoned.

I loved the old timey feel and decor of this place. 

I would come back for a late night snack or even just for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Quite delicious but desserts are advertised as $4 on menu outside, $5 on the wall but are actually $6 on the menu inside (and your bill)."}
{"text":"We walked in here because the decor looked really interesting and I am glad we did. The food was amazing. Having been to cuba, I had not expected much from this place but I was very wrong to think I knew anything about cuban food. 
The meats were really tender and full of flavour, although the portions are a little small, you will be satisfied none the less.

I would however stay away from the conch fritters. Not much conch, lots of fritter...

Donuts are something to try too!"}
{"text":"La Cubana a great addition to Toronto's diverse food scene. The Retro style deco is bright and clean. I dined on the patio, a nice and intimate experience, clean and modern. 
 I dined with my wife so we ordered a bocadillo, the mussels with lime and coconut. Good temperature and flavour. For our meal we ordered Cuban sandwich's with black bean and slaw sides. The Cuban sandwich is delicious the highlight of our meal, it was hot and flavourful. However in the future I will definitely skip the black beans and rice and the slaw. I found the rice and beans were a bit dry, they really lacked moisture and the temperature was barely warm. The slaw didn't move me because it tasted old. 
  The Mohito's we ordered were fair but a bit steep in price for what they were. 
  For desert the key lime pie and the Cafe con Leche was a real pleaser, we both loved it. 
   The service was friendly and timely. All in all a good experience. But if you are a Cuban food purist from Tampa or Miami don't get your hopes to high. This place is great Cuban-Toronto fusion resto. Not a traditional Tampa style Cuban spot. That said I did enjoy my experience at La Cubana."}
{"text":"After we spend $28 on a meal for two, we left to look for more food somewhere else coz we obviously wasn't full. 

Everything tasted alright, but nothing special like the other reviews claimed. It's on the salty side, the fried plantains especially. I was a bit disappointed that when I asked if I could have no onions in my sandwich, the cashier just said no, with no further explanations to why. (My husband ordered it and I took a look- it's probably coz the red onions were pre- diced and mixed in with the sauce. That explanation would have been nice. )

Probably wouldn't return - not worth the bang for the buck."}
{"text":"To be clear I have no real complaints about the food. The food is fine, if a bit underseasoned. I had the chicken sandwich ($9) and a side of rice and beans ($4). Bread was good, sandwich was tasty, r&b were underseasoned but not the worst I've had.

My main complaint is the pricing. As an example it seems crazy to charge $4 for a small (I would say 1/2 cup) portion of rice and beans as it is one of the cheapest food items you could think of. 

I do understand that restaurants have other costs to cover but at this location it's counter service only so they are not paying service staff. (I have been to the Ronces location and felt fine about paying for a nice location and attentive service.)

Overall the food was fine but I felt the pricing was way off and I don;t think I'll return. It just felt like a massive gouge."}
{"text":"This place makes amazing food! The only downside is that it is a small place and does not take reservations, and every time I go, It's always busy, so expect a wait!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant that serves up very tasty Cuban food.  Don't be foolded the understated ambiance, enter and be surprised.  I ordered the Guava BBQ Beef Rib plate which was plentiful and delicious with wonderful spices that aren't overwhelming but palate tantalizing. Order a plate and you have the chance to taste a variety of house specialties like the Purple Cabbage Slaw and Beans and Rice.  Servings are very generous. Our table also ordered the Medianoche Pork Belly sandwich, don't miss out on this.  Value for money, and flavours that make you crave for more."}
{"text":"I came with 3 friends for dinner last Thursday. There was a slight wait (about 20 minutes) when we arrived at 7pm but it was well worth it. We ordered bocaditos to share, followed by medianoches (hearty sandwiches with brioche-like bun) and dessert. What I love is that the flavours are refreshingly different from the rest of the Toronto scene. 

Highlights of the evening:

Chorizo Empanadas (3 per order)
Grilled Coconut shrimp (4 per order)
Traditional medianoche (can't go wrong)
Guava BBQ shortrib medianoche (for bolder flavours)
Pineapple upside-down cake (perfect ending)

Excellent service and food. Looking forward to trying their brunch soon!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy and well-priced but service was slow, somewhat grumpy and they were very adept at ignoring people - not just us. Server wasn't very attentive in general, we felt like they would've preferred we weren't there. Took over an hour at lunch for 2 sandwiches.  When we asked where they were the server said \"yah, we are really busy\". Um, okay.  First of all they're grilled cheese sandwiches with some pre-sliced meat, secondly the restaurant was 2/3 full including the patio. We weren't impressed. Cute spot and great concept but overall a pretty blah experience."}
{"text":"Does the no takeout policy during brunch hours (10-4) make sense when the restaurant is half full at 3:30? I get it when it's slammed, but why adhere to a 'policy' and turn away business with a sandwich order (2) that is so easily filled? I asked, and the waitress just kept repeating 'it's policy' 'it's policy' it's policy' like some automated drone. How about some autonomy and make an easy call to increase your daily sales? Why not be flexible and take my money? This doesn't make sense to me, there are so many other restaurant options in the neighborhood it seems crazy that they feel like they can wave their hand and turn away orders in such a cavalier way."}
{"text":"I have been the biggest fan of this restaurant. Today had a terrible experience. All I requested was having my eggs was over medium. I want told NO MODIFICATIONS!! Your loss ... Will never rave about you guys again."}
{"text":"Guava Short Rib sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Cravings will follow for sure. Corn Frituras were perfect. Reasonably priced, very tasty, great service. Added benefit: there was a line, they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, made it easy to head to the very nice bar next door (The Roncy) for a before dinner drink!"}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem by walking down ossington. It's like a hole in the wall but it's amazing !!!! The best Spanish food I've ever had!! It really feels like you're in Cuba when you walk in. It has a bar with a few seats at the front so you can sit and order right at the bar. There's a few tables at the front of the restaurant and then there's a little room in the back that seats more people. In the summer time there's a little air conditioner that turns on and in the winter time they have a nice cozy fire place. 

The food here is amazing. I usually always get the beef short rib plate. It costs $15 and fills your right up! The beef short rib is always cooked to perfection. It comes with some Spanish rice and beans, some sour turnips, and 2 pieces of platana. 

They have a few different Cuban desserts too. i've tried the lime pies and the doughnut. Both are quite good!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on my Cuban friends referral. I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is lovely and relaxed. The torquoise tiles on the walls and painted white brick give the impression we are in an old world restaurant in Cuban. I couldn't help myself to order a Mojito and I really enjoyed the fresh mint and strong rum. I ate the Cuban Chorizo Burger and my hubby had the Pork Belly Dinner. Both were very tasty. Each meat was juicy and had alot of flavour. I will definately come back and recommend everyone I know."}
{"text":"This is my second time at La Cubana. Could never go wrong. Hands down one of the best meals in Toronto. 

Walking up and down Ossington ave, we totally based our decision on their hand painted signs (and then the decor... And then the menu). I got to try everything off of the menu. Do get the short rib and a side of fries.

No frills, just good food as you watch the people lining up for some Bang Bang.

At night, you pay up front and get the service afterwards. During the daytime you get regular table service.

10/10 would dine again."}
{"text":"Their Cuban style coffee is unreal! Definitely best for lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food here when it is prepared correctly.  The mojitos are amazing too!  Recently went with a friend - she had the avocado salad and had to send it back as she received a bruised or overripe one with brown all over it.  I had the fish sandwich and had the send it back as half the fish was burnt.  An auspicious start to our lunch date but once the food was corrected it was very tasty.  Not sure how it made it out of the kitchen in the first place though.

Also note that strollers are not allowed on the patio as, according to the staff, there is no room since chairs and tables are so close together.  So if it's a beautiful day you may want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I were told about this place so we couldn't wait to try it! 

The moment we walked in I knew I was going to enjoy it! The atmosphere and decor was great! It felt like I was somewhere warm...like Cuba! 

It's not a big place, but it's super adorable and they did well with their seat setup for the space they have. I loved the food! The quantity of food doesn't look a lot, but because it is so flavourful you are actually full in the end! 

And we LOVED the calamari appetizer! I could go back there and just order a bunch of that and I'm good! 

But I would like to try the other dishes because they looked and smelled great when they were served at other tables!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner at La Cubana much more than I had expected (I have a strong bias against sandwiches).  Opted to skip over the sandwich portion of the menu, and had the guava bbq beef short rib, which was a generous portion of fork-tender beef, smothered in a mildly tangy, savoury barbecue sauce and a dollop of chimichurri.  The side of tostones (two circular patties of fried plantains) and heap of fluffy rice & beans made it a substantial meal, and the red cabbage slaw was a nice addition to an otherwise pretty heavy dish.

Was less impressed by the conch fritters, which were like doughnut holes without much taste beyond the dough.  

Topped everything off with the chocolate natilla, which had a pudding/mousse combo texture, and the taste of a milky chocolate - not too sweet, which I liked.

Atmosphere is casual, though you'll still get your own table and service (no hipstery communal tables here!).  Something inside those greyed-jade walls and tiled floor feels like a little slice of Havana."}
{"text":"A sweet colour palette
An emo cashier
A savoury plantain
Ay papi 

Well...... 

If I could resume my experience here in one word it would be: Dale!

Have tried the plantains, the sandwiches and the bbq guava ribs. Pretty decent BUT needs more soul, more sizzle, ya tu saes!. Guava bbq ribs need more sauce chef. However well slow cook pot mijo.

The colour palettes is utterly satisfying falling under a mint and white duo with red accents, refreshing and smooth to the eye providing a vintage feel as well.

One of the cashiers last week was sad or on the verge of chugging the club havana bottle behind her on the shelves to repress further her situation, not sure, but man her service was horrendous.


My friend loved the bean soup and plantains. Salty, bit crunchy and soft inside. Good job deep frier!

Oh by the way there was this guy that night, having dinner, that tried so hard to look with the likes of Kevin Hart. HA! guy you are not funny man, put your show together. Even Pitbull is funnier than you. Dale!

Anyways good spot, the only few places to try cuban fare.

Dale!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and great food...what else could we say!

Will reco this place foooo sure!

First time eating Cuban food and loved the overall experience.

Want a cool legit place to eat...look no further, La Cubana is the place to hit up

Thanks to the bar tender who was a super kool kat!!!"}
{"text":"This is not the authentic pressed Cubano you've been searching for. I'm not necessarily against paying hipster prices occasionally for food that's a real treat, but it irks when every part of the meal is nondescript and you feel like you're being charged primarily for ambiance. Keep your seafoam green subway tiles and school house lights and give us some decent sanguches!
Their sandwiches would be an alright deal if they came with sides, but are at ripoff prices a la carte. Also 5 bucks a piece for those sides they won't include with your lunch sandwich? ridiculous."}
{"text":"The decor if this place is great and it has a really nice brunch menu. But the service we had today was really poor. We were left waiting around 40 minutes for our food. Could have been more but was at least that. All the tables around us were served well ahead of us ( even people who arrived after us ( one couple arrived, ate and left). This itself would have been fine if they came to apologize or acknowledge it. Never even asked if we needed drinks when we had finished ours. When I asked, they just said there was a delay as they were busy on the patio n didn't say anything when I pointed out everyone else got served around us long before. When it finally came, the food was ok but really nothing amazing. We had raspberry n lime drinks which tasted of pure lime. Wouldn't be rushing back."}
{"text":"This is a marvellous restaurant. A fun 50's vibe with an fantastic menu and friendly servers. The food and cocktails are all Delish! One of my favourite spots on Roncy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has the most amazing vibe and the menu is simple. It offers a good range of sandwiches and a same options in platters. 

I started out with their Mojito (delicious!!) and their guava short rib (superb!), Mr. H had the chicken platter and yuca fries. The fires were good.. could have been seasoned better. The ribs were tender and flavour was unique. I tried the chicken as well and felt the ribs were much more flavourful. 

I will certainly be coming back to try the other items on the menu, it also just looks like a great spot for the summers!"}
{"text":"The combos are so good here, I love the pulled pork- classic and delicious. The food is super comfort food. Their plantains are solid as well. It's a super casual spot among the trendy strip on ossington which makes this place cool to visit in itself. Haven't tried too many of their sandwiches, I'm a fan of rice beans, and meat so that's my go to when I come to la cubana."}
{"text":"I've been to both La Cubana locations and have to start by saying that the food has been consistently good. Portions are a bit small for what you pay, especially the full plates but the quality is not in doubt. My big issue with the Ossington location was that today the service was rude and disrespectful. Not looking at you while you order or pay, or acknowledging when you say thank you for the food. There are so many places to eat delicious food in Toronto that there's no room or excuse for this kind of service. Disappointed."}
{"text":"They claim to be Cuban, but not really. I'm a Chinese-Cuban person travelling to Cuba about 5 times per year. So I should know what is real Cuban food and a real Cuban sandwich. The yucca fries are good though. Small portions and a bit expensive. They are only 3 real Cuban places in Toronto and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"It was a Monday and my friends and I were looking for a portuguese churrasqueira place. Apparently Monday is when all of them decided to close. 

As we were driving down little portugal we remembered about the good reviews for La Cubana. We decided to go check it out. 

We tried a sandwich, a main and a side. 

We ordered the Sandwich and for the quality and freshness, it was definitely worth it, I felt like it was worth it more than San cosme.

We also tried the Guava short ribs as recommended by the yelp reviews.
And a side of yuca fries.


Pressed Cubana (4/5) $10.99
It was my first time eating a cuban sandwich and to me it was a pleasant experience, the bread had a nice crusty grilled texture, the fillings were fresh and plentiful. 

Guava BBQ Beef Short Ribs (5/5) $15.99
It surprised me how delicious and moist this dish was. The guava was a great enzyme breaker for the short ribs, and added that extra sweetness note. The chimichurri sauce was good and fresh. 

Yuca Fries (3/5) $4.99
It's okay if you want to try something different. I mean its still a fried starch, I don't find it anything particular exciting.

Overall, I would definitely revisit and try their other items in their other locations. Each location have their own unique dishes!"}
{"text":"i give a 10 our of 10 for the achiote sandwich i had yesterday, i tried the corn and cod appetizers and they were really good too"}
{"text":"The menu is smaller compared to the other locations, but I did check out the menu before visiting so I can't complain about that, except I wish they had it all too.

We ordered the roasted chicken plate and pork belly sandwich with a side of yuca frita. We were impressed with the portion side. The pork belly was soft and tender and simply melts with every bite. Oh and the buns were

 amazing, it was sweet. This sandwich reminded me of an Asian BBQ pork bun, except this was much much better. The description of the dish made it sound overly sweet (honey glazed with pineapple salsa) so I was kind of worried. But to my surprise it wasn't the at all. In fact, it even had a small kick of heat to it. Just deliciousness!

The roasted chicken was seasoned well, juicy and tender. Served with the homemade pepper sauce, made the dish very more flavourful!

The yuca frita was a great side, this root vegetable has always been one of my favorite.

Overall, La Cubana is great on the wallet and the dishes are filling and packed with flavours. Can't go wrong coming here when your hungry."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, awesome service and outstanding decor. I couldn't have asked for any better during my brunch meal. I cannot wait to come back here to check out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My favourite are the yuca fries :) I felt like I was on vacation in Cuba again because of the menu and music. I would come back, it's great food for a great price."}
{"text":"Dios mio!
I strolled in here with a couple friends on a whim and at first glance really loved the atmosphere. It has a bit of an old school diner feel which I really enjoy. Reminded me of the vintage cars you can find the locals driving in all over Cuba. 
I ordered the veggie medianoche and a side of the yuca frita. The sandwich was exceedingly tasty. Fresh greens, tomato, and avocado with cheese and a really nice sauce inside of a soft round bun. The sauce got a bit messy, but everything tasted lovely. The yuca frita was an adventure. I ordered it without knowing exactly what I was getting into. The fried cassava had a crunchy golden exterior that was a beauty to behold. On top of the side dish was a creamy garlic sauce. When I bit into these thick cut fries I found the cassava root had a nice meaty texture. In my opinion the garlic sauce was a bit overpowering and kind of masked the natural flavour of the cassava. It was a large serving of fries though and I wish I had been more hungry because this was a rare occasion where I couldn't finish every morsel of my meal (I was pretty full when we got there). 
Food tasted great. I would make a return trip!"}
{"text":"I could easily write a essay about how much I loved the decor and design of this restaurant. I did really enjoy the food and drinks but features like the mint green wall tiles and fantastic hand painted signage elevated the experience."}
{"text":"What a great addition to an already diverse neighbourhood!

We've been waiting for a good Cuban restaurant that would bring back some good memories of Miami, and this resto did not disappoint.

We had the black bean soup; yucca frita; red cabbage slaw; pork shoulder; and the Achiote chicken, and they were all pretty wonderful. Flavourful, and not over- or under-seasoned. We didn't try any desserts, but a key lime bar once the warm weather comes, sounds tempting.

The menu is limited (we were really looking forward to maybe reuniting with some ham and cheese croquetas, like at \"Havana 1957\" in Miami), but what is here is good so far.

Service was \"leisurely\".

Will make this a regular."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork shoulder plate this evening and was served \"meat\" that was roughly 1/3 pure fat. We're talking huge chunks of it. 

When I complained the waitress, she explained that's how it was cooked. When I mentioned that how meat is cooked and how it's served can actually be two completely different things, she just looked perplexed.  No apologies offered.

Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"went for brunch today and they were super busy.  looked like they were short staffed.  but honestly, the staff were great! friendly, quick, in good spirits. my husband and I were very impressed with how well they dealt with being so slammed!

also the food was delicious! I got the steak and eggs and he got the breakfast sandwich.  we both loved it, although it is A LOT of food!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We had the chicken plate (toddler and mom shared). It was delicious. Drinks were yummy too (guava soda, raspberry lime ricky, mojito). Service was inattentive, but were cool about being flagged down when I needed something. Place was packed!"}
{"text":"Ordered the guava bbq beef short rib plate.  The beef was 90% fat. Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy the patio here in the warmer weather. I've eaten here three times and meals were quite good. I'm a sucker for their cubano sandwich. Food has been consistently good. I wouldn't say it's life changing, but definitely worth visiting for sure."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. However, the tostones are too dark which makes me think they reuse the oil a lot. 

Something I've never understood is why in such a multicultural city like Toronto, in places like this they aren't any Cuban waiters/ waitresses who would add much more authenticity to the experience?"}
{"text":"Traditional Cuban decor with friendly staff. Had a pressed Cubano sandwich with fries and a black cherry cola for lunch. Cubano had lots of melty cheese, ham, and pickle.  Would recommend for a casual lunch and something a bit out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Everything from the decor to the food is outstanding. Had a pressed Cubano which was amazing accompanied by tostones. So good!!! Raspberry like Rickey to go with was super tasty as well. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great diner inspired spot in Roncesvalles. Had the pressed Cubano sandwich (ham, pork, grainy mustard, gruyere), fried plantains (cut thick and lightly salted) and tasted the fish sandwich. Everything was delicious. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Definitely looking to go back and try more and would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"I tend to come here as a go-to when I have company in town.  The atmosphere and food is always promising.  I've been to this location several times and I love it.  

Usually getting the squid and a salad or a fish dish with the sides.  Always great, never disappointing.  I wish they had other less spicy options as I'm not actually a fan of spicy food (and I'm gluten free. and I'm vegetarian.)... but I make the exception when I have friends visiting.  It's not somewhere I'd choose to go if everyone I am with has already gone, nor would I go solo.  But that's my personal response.

It's definitely a place you need to try if you haven't been. 

5/5 food
5/5 staff
5/5 ambiance

4/5 for me because I am a fan, but I personally have other favourites and it's not in my top ten."}
{"text":"My partner and I went on a Saturday evening around 6PM. The Ossington location, our first choice, was closed because of a \"pipe problem\". So we hopped on a streetcar and ventured to this location. There was no wait to be seated and there was even an open table on the (really nice but somewhat crowded) patio! Woohoo!

I started off with a beer. They have two Cuban-style beers brewed by the Junction Brewery and I will verify that the pilsner is quite good. We ordered a side of yuca frita and each had a pork shoulder platter. He asked for his slaw to be swapped out for extra rice and beans. 

40 minutes after ordering, our food finally arrived. Yikes. The waitress said \"The yuca is on its way\". 

A few minutes into the meal we discovered that his, although it had extra rice and beans, still had a scoop of slaw sitting underneath the rest of the food. Huh?

The meat was tasty but not mind-blowing (4/5). The slaw was okay (3/5), the tostones were tasty (4.5/5), and the rice and beans was probably the star of the night (5/5). I'd come back for the food. 

The yuca frita never made it out to our table and the waiter was pretty much a no-show at our table for us to ask for it. We had long since put away our food and couldn't flag anyone down to get the bill. Finally, after I deliberately stacked our dishes and silverware and put them at the end of the table, our waiter came to take them. I asked for the bill and the yuca fries still appeared on them. 

I told him that they never came out and that I'd rather not receive them now - just get a new bill with the charge omitted. Mistake. It took another 10 minutes or so to get a new bill. 

The whole dining experience took us almost two hours - we didn't order appetizers or desserts, just drinks and a main entree with a side to split - and we never got to try the yuca fries we so desperately wanted. 

Oh well. Maybe we'll give the Ossington location a chance, but I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Better of the locations. Ossington has such great vibe and this restaurant completely reflects the essence of the culture. 
A tight space, but airy. The place is noisy but you feel relaxed. I don't know exactly how to discribe it without sounding like an amateur poet or a fanboy. 
We like being here as a family. We've always been treated amazingly."}
{"text":"I prefer the Ossington location. There is weird vibe here that's almost snobby. The food is the same for both locations which always wins the day."}
{"text":"Food is great, and make sure to ask your server about how each option is cooked, because they don't give their food enough credit on their menu. Most of their dishes are cooked through sophisticated cooking methods. I would have liked the interior to be a bit more private, at least less lights would be a good start!"}
{"text":"Great Great Great Cuban Sandwiches and a nice atmosphere. My girlfriend and I came here on Monday after a epic march through High Park to visit the Baby Deer and the Baby Yak, so we were famished

The Decor is interesting with nice tiles and Cuban Music playing. We ordered two appetizers, The Tostones Rellenos (which Wikipedia tells me are fried Plantain chips)  and the Conch Fritters; neither of which I had eaten before. Both were nice, though I enjoyed the Conch fritters more, with their soft meaty texture and nice garlic sauce. 

We then moved on to the Sandwiches. I had the Classic Cuban (which Wikipedia says is from Miami..) with Gruyere, Pork and Mustard. My gf had the fish sandwich with avocado and pineapple salsa. Both were good but the Fish sandwich was the clear winner, with a better texture and more flavour. 

The only thing that prevents this place from getting 4 stars is the service. Our Waitress seemed a bit brisk.... and as soon as she deemed it acceptable plates were whisked of our table with a warp like speed. I appreciate prompt service, but this bordered on abrupt."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great Cubanos. The Yuca fries r to die for... I've ordered from here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Order the doughnuts. So good......"}
{"text":"I had an epiphany about Cuban food after eating lunch here. I've travelled to Cuba several times, staying in both resorts and cities and I am not one of those people that thinks Cuban food is bad. In fact, I have made travel arrangements that deliberately got me a stopover in the Miami airport where I could dine at la Carreta, my all time favourite Cuban restaurant. But I've realized why la Carreta is good food in Cuban style, but not authentic Cuban food because la Cubana has authentic Cuban food.

Authentic Cuban food is healthy, well cooked and sticks to the ribs, but always seems a little lacking to me. The lacunae in the recipes is spice; Cuban food simply doesn't have any kind of flavour enhancing spice signature. I mulled this over in la Cubana as I drank a serviceable but bland mango coloda and a filling but unexciting chicken avocado and tomato sandwich. How did Cuba miss out on the spices that spread through the rest of the Caribbean and its cuisine? I have a vague notion that it has something to do with Cuba trading slaves for rum and sugar but not getting in on the spice trade during slavery, then missing out on the dispersion of Indian indentured workers post-slavery, then being cut off from a globalized expectation for chiles with our beans, avocados and rice dishes during the post 60s embargo. A very long speculation to explain why authentic Cuban food tends to disappoint in the flavour department.

But my roots are Caribbean, so I have different expectations. I know plenty of people who don't like spicy food, are suspicious of even garlic powder, and who will probably love this restaurant. It's got a small but varied menu, a cheerful and pleasing interior and shaded patio, and all service is with a smile. Bonus points for having a nothing-to-hide open kitchen space and scrupulously clean tiled walls . It's like someone renovated a surgical theatre into a fabulous eat-in kitchen - this appeals to the germphobic foodie in me.

And they did offer me hot sauce. Next time I'll take it."}
{"text":"Stopped by on an afternoon walk because it advertised for take out. Got a Cubano on a soft bun. Cheese was gooey; ratio of toppings was solid.  Expensive but so is everything these days. Place was small cramped and warm; would probably go for take out only. Service was polite."}
{"text":"This was a great nice place to pop by for delicious eats and mixed drinks. Best mojito I've had without a doubt. The atmosphere is very relaxed and chill,it's the type of place where you order at front and wait till they call it, or u sit at counter and they bring it. And major shout out to the plantains,  very sweet and mouth watering. Id go back for those alone. The woman working the day we went were very nice and easy to talk to. Love the decor, very bright friendly and fresh! That with the music calls for a great time."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times and the food is solid. It's not expensive and the food is always good. My favourite is the Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"Fantastic, especially the chicken and avacado sandwich. I gladly return over and over again."}
{"text":"Nice cute place and authentic cuban look. We got a breakfast sandwich.it was good but a bit simple. I wich they could add some side to it. But it was good. They serve de cubana coffe its good coffe. I would try again for breakfast!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere, with an excellent menu and friendly staff. I recommend the medianoche and corn fritters  (the veggie medianoche, for the vegetarians)."}
{"text":"WOAH. A huge hit of flavour right away and with each subsequent bite. I had ordered the guava bbq short ribs. And oh man, it was delicious! GET IT. The meat just felt off the bone. The plate also had a bit of rice and beans, slaw, and jalapeño. The mix of different flavours was just right and balanced out the dish, making sure the sweetness of the ribs didn't overpower it all.

We sat in the cozy room at the back of the restaurant one weekend afternoon for lunch. It was surprisingly empty!"}
{"text":"Cuban food gets a bad rap from the garbage found in all inclusives so it's nice to see a place changing it up.  I enjoyed the self serve, seat yourself type environment.

We were recommended the beef rib plate.  The meat was tender and the rice and beans delicious.  The plantains included were good too.  We also has the Cuban pressed sandwich.  Think of a yummy grilled panini.

It's a good spot to grab a quick bite and reasonably priced.  I hear the brunch is good and will be back to try it."}
{"text":"The universe is weird sometimes, like when you learn about these neat Cuban sandwiches and then while you're catching up on Dexter, you hear Jimmy Smits invite Michael C. Hall for some 'medianoches' down by the beach and you're like 'hey, I know what those are!' because you saw them on the menu at this cute little Cuban restaurant in Toronto that looks like an old timey diner with seafoam and chrome accents and red typeface everywhere and you sit at the bar with your friend who knows the staff because he likes it so much and they're all a bit quirky, like one guy has a panda tattooed on his forearm and the chick behind the bar has super kewt glasses and she tells you about how she loves tequila and once she tried this $1000 bottle made by New York lesbians and then she recommends the conch frituras (yes, you can listen to the sound of the ocean AND eat the stuff inside those big shells!), which are basically just tasty donut balls you dip in savoury mayo and also the broth from your coconut lime mussels and you're really enjoying washing it all down with some $7 pints of their house beer and then your grilled fish comes along with yummy pineapple salsa, tostones, beans, rice and purple cabbage slaw, and you do your best to finish it but your eyes were bigger than your stomach and now you're full as fuck but you def wanna come back to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Not sure how it takes over an hour and a half to make and serve a sandwich. Food is good if you can afford to take the afternoon off to get lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch at the Cubana! I had a guava BBQ short rib medianoche (sandwich) with a side of tostados (fried plantain slices). Mmm-mmm! Fabulous service and great background Cubano music makes this a place To which I definitely plan to return. Love it!"}
{"text":"Exorbitantly expensive for the quality of food served.  There is nothing Cuban about this food.  A gimmicky restaurant in a trendy neighborhood.  Don't waste your time or money.  They serve small portions in a poorly attempted  diner type atmosphere. Too bad. It's a great idea and would be more impressive if they cut their prices in half and have some Cuban Music playing in the background at least.  Good Cuban food is not expensive or complicated to make."}
{"text":"Right now this restaurant is showing at 3.5 stars. That's a really fair appraisal, between A-OK (which is still good) and great. The food is all really tasty. I had the opportunity to sample a bunch of things from both appetizers and mains. On the apps front, the plantain rellenos were very popular. The squid was great and despite being habanero were not hot so they were fine for kids. The fish main was the least good, mostly because I found the portion of fish a tad small (it seemed smaller due to sharing). I can see why; all mains hover at around the $15 mark and fish isn't cheap. To hold that price, you need to cut down on the quantity of fish. The pork shoulder was super tasty and unlike a lot of pork shoulders was not dry. Despite the comment of another reviewer about fat, it wasn't fatty. It was properly moist. It's a pork shoulder; you slow cook them because of the fat content. Don't like fat? Don't order a pork shoulder because lean pork shoulder sucks. Which brings on the Pork Belly Medianoche. Now there is fat! Good fat. Great sandwich and a fair price. Sides of rice, slaw and plaintains are terrific. 

The only downside to the place is that it's not perfect if you want to linger. They move you along at a brisk pace. Understandable given the diner-like vibe and the long line out the door. Great for a fast or family dinner where kids don't want to sit for 2 hours. Four stars from me because the food is great, well-priced, and it's nice to have a joint nearby that's good for a family dinner (the kids loved it)."}
{"text":"I can not express how much I love this place! It has quickly become one of my favourite spots for lunch in the city. I've tried multiple Cuban sandwiches in Miami and this place easily blows them all out of the water. 

My go to dishes are the cuban sandwich, the guava braised short rib and the avocado salad. Also, the cafe con leche is incredible!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest little places I've been to in a long time. Amazing cuban food supplemented with an awesome retro-cuban vibe. The sandwiches are made with heart, and you can taste it in every bite. Tried the Cubano on a brioche (soft-bun), and it made me wish I had 20 left to go. Had a side of Yuca Frita as well. Would be my go-to spot if I lived in Toronto. Great restaurant in a cool part of town."}
{"text":"Went to La Cubana on Roncesvalles for lunch today and ordered the Chiote chicken sandwich and I must say I was very impressed. The chicken was pulled and slathered in a delicious sauce. There were avocados and tomatoes in the sand which as well. 

Overall very good! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable lunch at la Cubana today! The food is very authentic, I have family in Cuba and it took me right back to the culture. The entire atmosphere embodies Cuban culture. Music was awesome, the server was very friendly. They made sure we always had what we needed. We got the fish sandwich and bbq beef rib plate. I loved both. The ribs however were very very fatty. It was hard to eat that's how much fat was on it but I think that is part of the authenticity because in Cuba the meat is served very fatty. I def recommend checking out this spot !"}
{"text":"My friends and I wandered in around 8:30 pm on Wednesday night after some drinks and absolutely fell in love. 

I thought it was only Cuban sandwiches, but there's a wide variety of options for vegetarians, people eating gluten free and meat lovers! 

I had the short rib plate and everything melted in my mouth. The plantains that come with it (*heavily salted*) were so delicious! The slaw is fantastic!! THE MEAT - the meat was so perfectly cooked and flavoured. It honestly felt like a homemade meal; quality meat, and produce, and so perfectly cooked. It's nothing fancy but oh my goodness, it is incredibly delicious!

I loved the diner feel; the food came fast, the atmosphere inside is casual and the staff was so friendly and nice. 

I am sure I'll be eating here a lot more!"}
{"text":"Short rib - absolutely amazing. Rib is boneless and melted in my mouth. Slaw has a bit of luck to it. Plantains were salty, just chewy and sweet enough. Rice and beans were good. All really flavorful. 

Boyfriend ordered the Pressed Cubano. He liked it but $10 for a sandwich seems like a lot to me. 

Donuts - Delfish. 

Server was pleasant. Food came out fast (less than 1 minute)."}
{"text":"What the hell happened? 

We came here frequently in the wintertime, and just two seasons later everything has gone way down the drain. I'm so disappointed and sad!

All the food items have changed for the worse. We were anxiously waiting for our favourite Bean and Cheese Empanadas.
When the waiter put down the plate, all of us thought he had given us the wrong dish. Like WTH... why does our empanada now taste like a mediocre SAMOSA and why does it look like a DANISH PASTRY. WHY. 

Now onto the Chorizo Medianoche, which used to be topped with a delicious mayo and pickled slaw, and now its just a dried sausage patty with an OK slaw, few drips of sauce and KETCHUP? Their once famous buns were dry and hard.

The Rice and Beans side dish for $4 used to come in a generous serving dish. And now they basically served us 1/4 of it. That pissed us off."}
{"text":"Great little place, and the prices are good for your portions.  Would definitely return"}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Cubana at an affordable price, La Cubana is the place to be.

I ordered the Shortrib Medianoche (guava BBQ short rib, slaw chimichurri, crispy onions), a side of Yucca Fries, and a CD glass of Cerveza Negra.

Although I wanted the meat to be a little more tender, the overall taste of the sandwich was perfectly balanced. The tartness of the chimichurri went well with the seasoned short rib strips. The crispy onions were also a nice touch, as it gave the sandwich its needed crunch in every bite.

My tips: Order two different sandwiches with a friend and have them split the sandwiches into two. A great way to try different flavours without getting too stuffed."}
{"text":"Oder the presses cubano sandwich and it was delicious. I also ordered the mojito and it was ok compared to other places that I've tried. The place accommodated a large group in just a short notice. I will eat here again if I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Distinctly uninspiring. Portions were small, prices high (even for Roncy) and the food quality was mediocre. Definitely 'Canadianized' Cuban food. Clearly taking advantage of a bunch of people who never had good Cuban food before - or lived somewhere with a large Cuban population.Good wait staff, and the drinks were pretty good. Left hungry though, even after an appetizer and an entree."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Lower Ossington for a play, I go here. It's open at night, day, and good for both. Simple menu, but delicious. Decent prices and OMG THE DONUTS OMG. 
The chicken sandwich and plate are delicious, unfortunately the others all have pork which I don't eat (except the veggie) so I have only had the chicken but it's so good. The yuca fries are amazing, too. 
The service is quick, too."}
{"text":"La Cubana on Ossington is my fave fave fave but I gotta say - the patio in this one gets major brownie points. 
This was my first time at this location, and it's just as good, plus outdoors, so. 
Good service, quick, EXCELLENT food. 

GET THE DONUTS: Do-Not miss them (hahahaha, get it?)"}
{"text":"I love La Cubana! Admittedly, I like the vibe/(bigger)space of the original Roncesvalles location more but I think they both deserve five stars. 

La Cubana has really delicious food. My favourites are their pressed Cubano sandwich and their plated meals. The pork in their Cubano has been cooked down until tender and full of flavour. The cubano is finished off in the panini press but their other sandwiches come on soft brioche-like buns. Plated meals are another go-to and come with a protein, rice and beans, a cabbage slaw and tostones (smashed fried plantains). One plate is definitely enough food for one person as they're very filling. Usually my boyfriend and I order one plate and one cubano to share. Their roast pork is definitely my favourite protein (same as in the cubano, surprise, surprise) but all their other options are great too. I also like their beef and chicken. 

La Cubana also has delicious cocktails. Most are made with Havana Club rum but they have a couple of gin options as well. I usually get their mojito or their El Paraiso which is gin with grapefruit juice and muddled with basil. All their cocktails are $10 which is a steal these days since most cocktail bars are around the $14 range. They also have some house made non-alcoholic drink options too like a soda with their own raspberry and lime syrup (good if you like tart flavours) and Cuban coffee. I'm not particularly a fan of that style of coffee since it's way too sweet for me. 

For snacks I like their conch fritters which I believe comes with a chipotle mayo. They're more of a savoury donut and there's not much conch but there's bits of peppers in them which gives it a spicy kick. I always burn my mouth when I get these because I don't wait long enough for them to cool down. I can't remember if this location does their sweet donut holes too, but if so, they're really good! 

I love the vibe of this place and the La Cubana branding in general. It has cute tiles in a pretty mint colour and fun red and white menus that have a vintage vibe.I think this location has more of a grab and go-look to it than Ronces which is why I like it slightly less but the food is still consistent. This location also has a backroom that is more dim and intimate and I've seen it closed sometimes for private parties. It has more of a dim and intimate vibe compared to the bright and busy front of house. 

I noticed another review complaining about the pricing of this place with their plates at $16 and how they should be $10-$12. I definitely don't agree and I don't think that the price point is too high for what you're getting considering the average price of mains in Toronto. Aside from Chinatown or Koreatown, a $10 main is almost non-existent. However, I will say, some of their sandwiches that come on their squishy bun are a tad on the small side for $10 a pop but they deliver in quality and flavour."}
{"text":"Excellent Cuban food in a casual friendly diner setting. Everything I've had here has been fantastic - pork shoulder, short ribs, chicken and all the sides. Non nonsense, no airs, just good food, presented simply."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and loved it. The wait was reasonable (we took a walk around the block and came back when they texted us). 

The decor is very Cuban retro cafeteria--I love it. The food was good. I got the grilled fish sandwich, which was delicious. My SO got the short rib plate, and loved it too. WE shared the coconut shrimp and the squid, which were both delicious.

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! 

Cafeteria style makes for short wait time with a restaurant sit-down feel :)"}
{"text":"Solid brunch option. I read a few reviews that complained about the service; I thought it was great! Not overly fake-friendly, just the perfect amount of attention and professionalism. 
We had the corn frituras to start which were delicious: moist on the inside and crisp on the outside. I then had the breakfast sandwich and my friend had the chorizo hash. Both were great choices full of flavour and colours!
I think what I liked the most was the unpretentiousness of the place and the coffee."}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches in the city can be found here. 

I can't speak for most of the menu because I always order the short rib sandwich. It's awesome. 

A great spot to try something new and go on a culinary adventure."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Cuban restaurant for awhile and I'm so glad I found this little gem! 
This place is really tiny but has and lot of character and the food is absolutely delicious.

My friend and I ordered the Guava BBQ shirt rib with rice and beans, slaw and plantains - amazing! 
I also love how their soft drinks are in cute little glass bottles instead of plastic bottles or cans - super random I know, but they were too cute not to mention. 

:)"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious, all the sandwiches, all the plates, the French fries and OMG the best key lime pie bar in all of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great Classic Cuban Sandwich.

Went in today for the first time and as soon as we walked in we felt an awesome old school 50's diner feel to it. We ordered 2 Cubano sandwiches and a side of fries. I thought the food was good. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. I had to ask for some hot sauce and unfortunately it's 50 cents extra. For me I think it's the kind of place that's great if you're kind of feeling like a quick sandwich for lunch... however, it came out to $28 and we only has water. Not my kind of place to spend that much on only 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ordered from Ubereats April 22. 
The food came hot and organized in a paper bag. I wouldn't normally bother reviewing an Ubereats order, but their food was that good!

Pros
Achiote roasted chicken - Amazing flavour, tender and flavourful. The tostones were an unexpected highlight as I don't eat plaintains often.

Pork shoulder - Very unique and tender also came with 2 tostones. The cabbage slaw is surprisingly good. 

Buttermilk donuts - Comes with 6 timbits, wow these were amazing, they melted in my mouth. 

Cons
Food portions a bit too big for my liking, I was only able to half of the portion. I guess it's better to get more food than less though. 

Protip 
The unique decor and ambience in restaurant is worth going to at least once, I felt like I was in Cuba!

Damage $41 before delivery charge and tip."}
{"text":"I walked by this cute little restaurant many times and had always wanted to try it. The atmosphere is fun and casual and resembles and old-school diner. I went for lunch the other day and was very impressed by the food and the service. I ordered the roasted chicken thigh sandwich and had the donuts for dessert. My friend and I arrived with our two strollers and the owner very kindly came out to assist us with re-arranging the tables. While this is a self-order, self-serve type of restaurant everyone working here was very kind and accommodating. The food was delicious - the bun of the sandwich was soft and the flavours of the sandwich were great. It was a great place to grab a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent dining spot on Roncy.  We came here mid week and it was quite busy.  For starters we had the calamari and cod cakes. Both were excellent the standout being the calamari which was melt in your mouth fresh and had a sweet spicy habanero glaze. The cod cakes were hot and nicely seasoned.  For mains we tried the Cubana sandwich and grilled fish.  The sandwich was huge and well filled with meat and cheese perfectly toasted and not dry.   My grilled fish came with tostones and rice & beans.  The fish was meaty and had a crisp finish.  It came garnished with pineapple. We decided on donuts for dessert expecting small timbit sized donuts but we received about 5 huge donut holes dusted in cinnamon and sugar.  Service was excellent our server was enthusiastic and very helpful."}
{"text":"Cuban food in Toronto.  At one time all I ever knew of it was only at Julie's on Dovercourt.  Besides La Cubana having 2 locations this is the only one I've actually been to.  I could be wrong but years ago there was a cafe where I discovered Key Lime tarts made by Dufflet's and it was in the area of Roncy and Marmaduke.  Could this actually have been the place?

My first impression of the decor for La Cubana was wow this place feels like a restaurant themed after the video game \"Fallout 4\".  If not the feel of an underground living space it sort of reminds me of a hospital with that particular shade of green tile.

Besides how the place looks I can look to the menu which is for the most part very simple with a somewhat diverse choice of small plates, dinners, sandwiches and sides but enough to make up a good meal among the 3 of us that went there that day.

We started with an order of cod croquetas.  They seemed a bit mushy than the croquetas I'm used to eating but they were still ok.  For our mains my wife and my friend had asked for the Cuban sandwiches and a side of tostones and they shared rice and beans.  I had asked for the Cuban burger which was a burger made with ground chorizo instead of beef with a side of fries.  

The burger was good but it seemed a little dry considering this burger is made of sausage.  There was a bit of some sort of white sauce on it (mayo?) but not very much and although I was offered ketchup for the fries I'm surprised there's no other offering of sauce or something for the burger.  Still it tasted good and the veggies on it were fresh.  

The Cuban sandwich was not up to my standard sadly.  While the sandwiches were ok they are probably the furthest things you can do to use the ingredients needed in a Cuban sandwich (sort of) without actually doing it the way it should be made.  The basic ingredients are simple:  pork 2 ways (roast pork, ham), Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard on Cuban bread which is also known as \"torta\".  Every \"proper\" Cuban sandwich I've ever had is made on a thinner but crusty long bun, pressed, so that the outside is toasted to the point if I bite into it the bread is to the point of almost being \"cracker like\".  The point is the torta is thin by being pressed and the inside of the sandwich either surpasses the thickness of the bread (both top and bottom combined).  In both cases this sandwich failed that.  The amount of \"insides\" wasn't really generous as the slices of meat were very thin.  The next thing is that the bread was NOT a bun or torta but rather sliced toasted and pressed.  I don't know if they toasted the bread first and pressed it or toasted it by pressing it but the toasted sliced bread was TOO toasted and it was like sandpaper to the roof of my mouth.  Pressed bread isn't always necessarily fully toasted bread.

For dessert we each ordered the Key lime pie and both my wife and friend ordered cafe con leches.  The pie arrived in a jar and had the consistency of pudding.  Again, I've had my fair share of KL pie and this ain't it.  The coffee wasn't done properly either.  I tried it and my wife was shaking her head.  She knows her coffee and I tasted it and it didn't seem right.  Cafe con leche is supposed to be sweeter.  This seemed to just be a latte.

The service was attentive in a sense that while we didn't exclusively have the same person looking after us the entire time it seemed like everybody that came to our table was doing something different.  One took our orders, another brought us our food, another checked up on us and another brought us full bottles of water.

Only probably towards the end did I feel rushed to leave.  It probably had to do with the speed at which my plate was removed before I had a chance to eat the rest of my friend's sandwich and realizing by taking her plate I didn't have a napkin or cutlery anymore to eat the rest of the rice and beans.  We had asked for a container for the rest of the tostones but I didn't get to try nor take home the rest of the rice and beans which was about half the small plate.  There wasn't much but I wasn't asked if I wanted to take it as well... again, that hurried feeling.  

I turned around to look at the entrance to see if there were people waiting, there were.  Perhaps they really wanted us to leave so others could be seated.  I get that, I do but I don't like to be rushed as it's not a good feeling.  I wasn't the only one that felt that way in my party.

La Cubana is just OK but they're not great IMO.  As far as the food goes I've never been to Cuba but I've been to the other Cuba (Miami) and I go there pretty often.  Of all the places in the US I've ever been I've probably been to Pittsburgh the most number of times but I've spent the most time (days and nights) in Florida hands down.  I know my Cuban food pretty well because of that and I'm talking from street cafes to proper sit down places and in the scale of things La Cubana is just mediocre in that respect."}
{"text":"Two stars is very generous.
Brunch, generally is the fastest turn time for tables, parties of two generally taking one hour to an hour and a half. I was here for a total of three hours with one other person. I went with a \"chef friend\" who I thought would enjoy sitting at the bar which overlooks the kitchen. Our server was the bartender and this was like a scene from Bar Rescue before that guy comes in and starts screaming at everyone to get their act together. There was alcohol spilled everywhere, she was soaking trays with spilled drinks, the bar was gross. She ordered drinks from us and they came about 20 mins later. I started off having the utmost sympathy for this poor person who is responsible for the six or so seats at the bar and making drinks for the entire brunch rush. My friend and I were seated without food for so long that a member of the kitchen verbally took our order from us because \"we had been waiting so long\". 
Drinks were undrinkable, food was really yummy. 
It was after three that we finally got to ask for our bill, and were the only table left from the brunch crowd. Our server (the bartender) was standing at a pos system chatting with another server when I asked for the machine after sitting with cards out for 15 mins, looking around helplessly for someone to take my money so I could get on with my life. Was I being given a unspoken free pass to dine and dash because service was so bad? 
After asking for the machine she put it in front of me and walked away (I was expected to put in the cost amount myself?) I could have left her $2.00. 
Of course service sucked during the rush sitting at the bar, but after everyone had fled? Did I miss a DIY aspect to service here before coming? Should I have brought a cafeteria tray and a hose to clean my own dishes? I'm still so puzzled. 
The food was really yummy though so I'm in an emotional conflict if I should come back"}
{"text":"La Cubana is a fun retro Cuban diner.  There is a charming feel about the 50s look of the diner. The restaurant is bright and inviting. It captures the essence of the Havana vibe. The service was attentive and friendly.  The food is reasonably priced. 

To start, we had the corn frituras. The corn frituras were properly doughy deep-friend fritters that were soft on the inside. You can actually taste the corn. 

For the main, I ordered the Guava BBQ beef short rib was absolutely delicious. This dish will impress anyone who loves Caribbean food. The short ribs was tender and immensely flavourful.

This is not a fancy or high-end restaurant, but it does not pretend to be. La Cubana know what it is and fully embrace its concept of a Cuban diner.  I would highly recommend La Cubana."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service (maybe because we went right at noon so it was not crowded at all, server was very attentitive). The beef short rib and por shoulder plates were tasty and good portion size."}
{"text":"Have been a number of times here - food is awesome value and very tasty and new daily specials are incredible. 

Service can be patchy when eating in. Was made to wait around 40 minutes for food on one occasion which came with zero apologies from staff, despite their repeated assurances that it was coming sooner."}
{"text":"If I could eat those donuts every single day,
I would. Holy good!

I had the Cuban breakfast and that pork just fell apart - and don't forget to add a little hot sauce. It adds the perfect final touch!

PS. Even the coffee is consistently enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yuca fries and the Cubana sandwich were delicious. Fresh and good portion size. Very filling. Definitely will go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Everything tasted ok, but the prices were a little high for what you got. Ambiance and decor was neat. The staff seemed to be mostly hipsters. Found it a bit disconcerting that the waiter had no idea what maduros were...in the end it was decent food but not really authentic Cuban."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend for a quick bite. Place was pretty good. My boyfriend and I shared a pressed Cuban sandwich which was pretty tasty but I wouldn't say overly special in anyway. I don't think this place compares to something like banh mi boys. Also order the conch fritters which it didn't understand. They were just dough that was spicy.  No real fillers inside. I think it was fun to try but I don't think I need to return. Sandwiches were pretty easy to make at home."}
{"text":"Fantastic aesthetic. Lovely ambiance. Service is friendly and considerate. The bathrooms are private. The patio is small and sweet. 
The food. Omg. The food is rich, decadent and fresh. 
I had a shrimp appetizer, some sort of rub on it. Made me want to become a  mermaid to go find all the shrimp in the sea and take them to the chef here to make all the yummy for me forever. 
The pulled pork sandwich is huuugggeee like my butt is now from eating it. 
Worth it.

The fresh made donuts. The order is huge. Order one order for three ppl. I ordered two thinking I'd share with my flock. Nope. Had enough for a small army. 

Price is accessible. 

Will be back everyday till they kick me out for wearing mermaid costumes in a Cuban restaurant."}
{"text":"Looking for a unique breakfast?  This is the place to go.  Come early because a line up starts forming by 10:30.  A quaint little restaurant with a old school ambiance.

The Cuban breakfast includes tender shredded pork.  The chorizo hash is a crunchy and tasty combo.  The best, however, is the pork belly, perfect sear and great seasoning."}
{"text":"The lady at the cash was super nice and gave us great recommendations. I shared the veggie plate and veggie medianoche sandwich. The flavours in both were pretty well the same, but they were both delicious. If I had to pick between the two, I would probably pick the sandwich though :). Delicious! 

Tip: make sure to tip when you pay. Although you pay before getting your food, they still provide table service (dropping the food off at your table, providing water, cleaning the table, etc), and should still be tipped for all their hard work! :)"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Awesome place to have brunch and the food is simple and very tasty. Definitely try the donuts for dessert."}
{"text":"Glad to see that they opened a location in the East end! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and were seated promptly. Servers were polite and efficient. We had to try the Pressed Cubano of course and it did not disappoint! The Cuban Burger was also delicious and had a good kick of spice. As for sides, we tried the Conch Fritters and Yuca Frita. I did not know what to expect with the Conch Fritters but I thought there was a lot of dough and did not really taste the fish or peppers inside. The Yuca Frita was good though, had a nice crisp to the outside and very filling. Also ordered the Cafe Cubano and Cafe Con Leche - the espresso with demerara sugar was perfect. We would've loved to try the buttermilk donuts but were too full - will be sure to make room for that next time!"}
{"text":"Really good went there one evening. The food is served really quickly and its quite good. The lady serving was friendly and the bartender was fixing up some cool drinks. Had a Pilsner on tap"}
{"text":"New place in the neibourhood so 4 of us went there on a weeknight. The decor looked great and we had a good attentive server. Ordered a beer but they said it wasn't pouring- ok so it's only been open a week or two, no problem. 
Cocktail I ordered instead was didn't have a lot of taste, $10 which is kinda cheap for roncy I guess.
We had starters which were hit and miss. Coconut shrimp was very average, but  everything else we had was good. I had a fish sandwich for the main (cause the one in the blog TO from there looked amazing). Came out and was a very very small amount of fish between two large pieces of bread. Tasty, but nothing like what I had seen previously. Would not recommend. Slaw side was great. Deserts were good key lime pie and donuts that were made fresh. Yum 
Overall I would't say I had a great experience. I would give it a shot again though as they had some interesting stuff and a hip but laid back atmosphere. Maybe after they've been up and running a little longer."}
{"text":"This is very cute venue with a nice patio. Dreadful and indifferent service staffed by 15 year olds. Food is ok- great homemade bread. I came here when it opened years ago and now I remember why I did not return until today. Weak drinks and highly priced. Will not return."}
{"text":"Had a variety of dishes, and there was not a single one I didn't love! Food was impeccable, service was great! Try the Cuban grilled corn and guava BBQ beef short rib!"}
{"text":"Food:
I had the steak and eggs and shared the buttermilk donuts with my friend. I left feeling super full and was not at all disappointed by my meal. 

Service: The service was fine. Nothing that stood out although it is a very small space so when my friend and I were waiting for a table we kept on being asked to stand at different ends of the breakfast bar. All the servers were efficient but no one overly friendly.

Overall: I would visit La Cubana again but would be curious to check out their Ossington location"}
{"text":"Soo sooo good! From the whole vibe of the place right down to the food & drinks! Definitely worth checking out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy Cuban sandwich and tasty beer.  Very nice and clean inside. Tasteful decor, and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had the Cubano, slaw, rice and beans. All excellent. Oh - and the key-lime pie, which was good but could been a little more tart in flavour. Good service, nice vibe."}
{"text":"I've been to the Ossington location and really liked the service and the food there. So we thought that this location shouldn't be any different. Unfortunately for us, it failed to meet our expectations. 

We decided to come in on a Tuesday night to grab something to go as we knew that the restaurant was closing at 10pm. We got there at 9:40pm. The lady the greeted us was quick to point out that the restaurant is closing soon and that we couldn't dine in. WTH? What happened to \"Hi guys, just to let you know that we'll be closing at ten so we wouldn't be able to seat you at this time, but you're more than welcome to order takeout\"??? Then to top it off, she made a point to say sorry the to the kitchen staff right in front of us as if they're allergic to money and we were a nuisance. We came to patronize your business, the business that employs you and puts food on your table, we should not be treated as if we were some inconvenience to you. Bad customer service. -1 star

We ordered an order of empanadas, Cubano sandwich and a short rib. When we got the bill, we noticed that there was a \"takeout fee\" of 5% of the bill. Again, WTF??? I already dislike the social pressures of tipping as it is but to now make it mandatory especially when it was takeout where the wait staff did not have to do anything but take the order was just utterly ridiculous. -1 star

When we got home, I was excited to get to the empanadas, plural, or so I thought. I opened the container and there was one measly moderately sized empanada there. I paid $8 for one empanada!!! Again...WT F-ing F???! Let me write that again, one moderately sized empanada for $8. Not two empanadas. Not one large empanada. One moderately sized empanada for $8. To top it off, it tasted bland. I could buy these things at Kensington market for much cheaper and a hell of a lot more flavourful. -1 star.

On the upside, the sandwich and the short ribs were done very well and we enjoyed them. The rest of the negative stuff still left a bad taste in our mouths where we were unable to really appreciate the positives. 

Maybe I'll try visiting the Ossington location at some point again, assuming of course that that location is somewhat still the same from the last time I went there. But I don't think I'll be coming to this location again nor would I recommend this location to anyone else at this point. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Best place to get a cheap, but filling cuban lunch or dinner! The place is a small diner with limited amount of seats so it usually is filled on the weekends! I ordered the pulled pork plate that comes with bean rice, slaw and 2 pieces of fried plantane. The pulled pork was cooked to perfection. Each piece came apart so easily and the seasoning made it even more delicious. The whole plate meshed well together and I would definitely come back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Best cuban food I have ever had!!
Get the short rib plate but make sure you save room for the homemade donuts and a cuban coffee to seal the experience..."}
{"text":"Omg! Died and gone to food heaven! What a great little cuban gem....

Despite the hot humid Cuban like weather the service team were all smile and kindness.

Enjoyed everything that was served! Crispy calamari, cuban pork sandwich, shirt rib sandwich, superb little donuts not to mentioned a Cuban strong cafe con leche!

Next time we are back, yes there will be many next time back! We got for sampling all appetizers...wow, wait got to wipe my mouth with a napkin, drewling all over te place thinking about it!

To all foodies, try this one!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. The restaurant has great ambiance, friendly service, and a beautiful patio. To top it off the food was perfect for a mid-sized lunch with just a little something special. We had the grilled fish plate, it was fresh and satisfying, especially the pineapple salsa with cilantro. The shrimp was very good. Highlight was the key like pie served in a little mason jar - you could tell it was just made...incredible. Plus there spicy ceasars will kick you in the butt. Highly recommended, will be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed ever second of my Honey Glazed Pork Belly Medianoche and will now go and conquer the universe after my nap."}
{"text":"We went today at 11:15am and was able to get a table outside in the back patio.  The place was really cute.  Nice and calming back patio.  They have a white awning that can be rolled out so that you don't have to sit in the direct sunlight which is nice. Because of Pride weekend, it wasn't super busy either.

For starters, the coffee that they have is espresso based.  No drip coffee.  My boyfriend and I go the Cuban Breakfast and the Chorizo Hash.  I added our pictures.  The Cuban Breakfast was ok. The Roast pork was nicely done and moist.  The was good flavour in the chorizo hash, but I think it would be better if they increased the portion size of this a bit more.  The eggs on both were nicely done (med with centre still runny).  The fried plantains were a bit too overcooked?  It was a bit hard and too dry.  Rice with beans and the slaw was ok.

Service was fine.  There were 5 of us in our group.  She was very nice to all of us. But when we asked for the bill, it was all on one bill.  It would had been nice if she asked if we wanted separate bills."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad when he came to visit me in Toronto. I'm a huge fan of cuban food and had heard great things about this restaurant. When trying to find the restaurant (maybe we're both just blind) we had trouble seeing the sign and had to circle the area several times. When we finally did arrive the staff was friendly and receptive. The place was a little smaller than I anticipated, but the decor was warm and inviting, capturing the essence of Havana. By no means fancy, but if you are looking for a relaxing, chill place with delicious food then this is a great option. 

We started off by splitting a pitcher of sangria, which had a good juice to wine ratio. Lets be honest, going out to restaurants in Toronto I am always skeptical to order sangria. Half the time the sangria is mostly juice and you can't even taste the alcohol. On top of that, you're charged a good $40 bucks for it. I can't remember the exact price of this sangria pitcher but I remember it was reasonable (and tasty). We were off to a good start. 

The food is reasonably priced for what you get. We started off with chips and salsa, which were expectably good. The chips were a thinner chip style. For sides ($5 each) we split the Yucca fries, the cabbage slaw and the sweet plantain. The sides were by far my favourite. The plantain was absolutely delicious - not too soggy and not too crispy. Also was salted perfectly in my opinion. I recommend anyone who goes here tries these sides, which for me stole the show. Afterwards, I ordered the Achiote Chicken Sandwich ($10). The sandwich was tasty however I remember thinking they could have used a better bun.  For dessert we split the donuts ($6) which were exceptional. Can't go wrong with donuts!

Overall we were both pleased and I would recommend checking out this place for drinks and some snacks. I know I will definitely be returning at some point!"}
{"text":"Really great food. There's something for everyone, including kids and vegetarians. The portions are extremely large, the food was fresh, the service was pretty friendly and relatively fast. The space is a little crowded, so if you have more than 4 people you're probably not going to be able to dine in."}
{"text":"Ok here we go after a day out shopping, we first decided to go for Pho at our favorite place on Ossington. My partner, checking his iPhone started reading about La Cubana. Of course, as lovers of Cuba, I turned the car and away we went. I started reading a few reviews and not just on Yelp. They were not too favorable to say the least. Of course I don't believe in taking everything verbatim you have to gauge and basically see if there are positives that out weigh the negatives. It's Saturday and we arrived at 2:30 almost to close of Brunch. The place is packed, but we were greeted by a smiling face who asked how many and lead us to a booth in the back for 2. No issues here. Our server, Britney attended with a liter bottle of water and asked if care for drinks. Of course I requested a Cristal (Cubas national beer) no such thing but they have their own take brewed locally for them (Junction Brewery) my partner has a Caesar. The drinks arrived quickly with a genuine smile. The beer says \"Cuba\" and the Caesar was spicy and delicious with that subtle after kick. As this is Brunch, we perused the paper placemat menu. We are told however the Cuban Sandwich is sold out. \"What?!?! No Cuban sandwich?!?\" Please, it was 30 minutes till brunch ends and there are a host of other items in which to sample. I ordered the Cuban Breakfast. It was cerdo (pork) cooked to perfection topped with 2 poached eggs, rice and pea, red cabbage slaw, and tostones (fried plantain) add some house Habanero and mango pepper sauce and my mouth was delivered a flavour that was truly Devine. My partner had the Medianoche with fried egg (a fancier Cuban sandwich) cerdo, queso, shaved ham, egg pickles stuffed in a toasted bun. We each ordered the Yuca Frita which arrived fresh from the frier. They were crunchy, spicy and lightly salted with a side sauce for dipping. Our server was wonderful, I am one who finds there seems to be a rule to ask the customer \"how is everything\" just after you stock pile that embarrassing amount of food into your mouth, and I do not like it. Britney had the decency to wait till we were done and asked if we were finished or would like anything else. We ordered 2 Cafe con leche and the donuts. The coffee was delicious, lightly sweetened. The donuts were amazing. Although they took a while to arrive, I see why. They were piping hot straight from the deep fry and were coated with both Cinnamon sugar and confectioners sugar. Mmmmmmm. We both were delighted and the portions were sufficient. After all this was to be brunch. The decor reminded me of our friends kitchen in Matanzas Cuba and it was a delight. Yes the food may not taste like Cuban food, that because we are in Canada people and it's the dead of winter. Will we return? Absolutely! Do I want you to take my review and feel yes we are going to have the same experience? No, I do not. Go discover for yourself and by the way, when you walk in you smile first, trust me it's contagious!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here on two previous occasions, once for dinner the other brunch. Brunch was definitely my favourite, the food was tasty, the cafe con leche delicious.
I went with 3 friends on a Sunday around 6pm, there were two staff serving. On arrival we were seated at the counter. I've eaten at many restaurant counters....The Lakeview...The Stockyards.... Here at La Cubana, the staff prepping and cooking did their best to avoid eye contact or converse. After 20 mins we still hadn't been acknowledged by anyone and decided to leave. On the way out the waitress apologized and said it was their busy time. I pointed out that they should have more staff working but what I found really annoying was the staff ignoring us at the counter. Anyone who is employed in this type of business knows you at least engage your customers. I'd have waited another 20 mins if a smile, and some chit chat had been provided, as it was Roncesvalles is packed with bars and restaurants so we moved on to the next."}
{"text":"Let me break it down. 
1. Rude wait staff. 
2. Under seasoned Pork shoulder. With no sauce whatsoever. Hi, can I have some plain bland Pork please? No thanks. 
3. Very greasy rice and beans. I've had traditional Latin rice and beans and they are never this greasy. I mean it tasted alright, but way too greasy. 
4. Over priced and over hyped."}
{"text":"We shared a bunch of appetizers: grilled coconut shrimp, grilled corn, empanadas and had our own entrees. Their food and service are absolutely excellent. Fantastic  spot, lovely little place.

Staff is hilarious and the perfect amount of friendly. They're attentive and fast."}
{"text":"To be fair, I didn't have their cubano, which I really should have, but when I do mini food crawls by myself, I can't really do whole meals. I got their conch fritters ($4.99). I've never had conch in fritters before, but I hoped for a lot of conch in the fritters. There were four Timbit-esque sized fritters and a side of some sort of not quite tartar sauce type dip. The fritters were fresh and very very hot. They were also slightly spicy. They were quite good, but there was very little conch in them. Perhaps a small piece or two per fritter? I was rather disappointed. Tasty, but if I just want a piece of fried dough with little else, I'd rather get it elsewhere. Service was friendly though."}
{"text":"5 star brunch! Legitimately in my top 3 Toronto brunch places.

Right from the minute you walk in, this place oozes with character and originality. The place is styled so well with the painted floor tiles and latin vibed decor, and their patio is a decent size with both sunny and shaded spots for your dining needs.

The drink menu is finely curated with cocktails and a single beer on tap, which is a Cuban inspired pilsner made by Junction Craft Brewing. The beer is $7 for a pint but deliciously crushable yet full flavoured.

But the food is the real deal here. Their brunch menu is filled with delicious yet unconventional options. Sunnyside eggs with chorizo hash or pineapple glazed pork belly... Steak and eggs... Cuban inspired breakfast sandwiches... Baked eggs with sofrito and yuca with jalapeno sauce on top, just to name a few. These are served with rice, beans, tostones (tasty fried plantain hash brown equivalencies), and a red cabbage coleslaw.
These plates are all under $15 each, and not only have a lovely presentation, but are filled with unique and flavourful combinations. The portions are a fair size as well. 

Service was friendly and the food came out rather promptly so I literally have zero complaints. The only negative thing I possibly could say is that the place gets busy so getting a spot on a patio can might require a wait. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'll have to come back again when I didn't just finish a 3 course meal and a tea latte before stepping foot in here. 

My friends met us after our dinner and needed food, I've had this place bookmarked since my Florida trip awhile ago. 

It was perfect that ODD Seoul was too packed for the 4 of us that I got to recommend this place.

I like the counter ordering, it's very straight forward and easy. I'm not sure how it would be when it's super busy though.

I got the yuca fries: some pieces were too thick and over salted, but the ones on top were really good. The spicy mayo type sauce that came with it was good.

Conch Fritters: Lol I had 2 pieces and no conch...my friend ate the last one and had a huge piece. I guess my review will be on the batter itself, the peppers and spices was a perfect compliment to the crispy! 

i had a bite of my friend's cuban sandwich and it was good :0 Not Florida good but definitely Toronto good! 

Beers were not my cup of tea here. 

Service was friendly enough but since it's counter ordering, we didn't have much interaction. I'll be back to try their platters :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could assign half a star, that is how bad the meal was. This is a tiny place and our table was right by the door so we had to wear our coats as every time the door opened we got a cold wind down our backs. We ordered soup and for the main course the pork belly. They brought out our main course and forgot to bring the soup first, so we sent the mains back and waited for the soup. They must have kept our food under a heat lamp or warmed it in the micro wave as everything was dried out, except the pork belly which was a slab of fat with a little bit of meat underneath. The pork shoulder was also dry and stringy.  You could not pay me to return to this place."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and I have had some good Cuban pressed sandwiches. But the pressed Cubano was ehh. I have to admit that it's nice place decor and presentation but the food is eh."}
{"text":"This place has the best Cuban sandwich in the city, hands down. The chicken sandwich is my favourite but everything on the menu is great. Make sure to grab a coffee and some fried plantains with your meal for the ultimate Cuban experience."}
{"text":"I went for brunch and it was awesome! Only downside was that if you sit in the front it gets cold real fast, and it's expensive. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was perfect - avocado, tomato, cheese and fried egg on top of a perfect bun. It was SO GOOD! Plus their cafe con leche is incredible. Oh ya and definitely try their fresh donuts."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for a casual dinner in one of my favourite areas in Toronto! The decor is fun and bright, with beautiful tiles on the floor, and lovely typography for their menu, their design is 100% I came here a few times on weekday night around 7pm-8pm and never had trouble getting a spot.It gets a bit cold with the door opening though...

You walk up to the counter and order, they will either call your number and you pick up the tray at the counter or they bring it to you. The plates are $15, the guava bbq shortrib one is the best! The meat is soft and flavourful, and comes with a nice gravy like bbq sauce. The slow roasted pork shoulder is also good, but on the balder side compared to the short rib. The plates come with purple slaw which is fresh and tang, rice and beans and fried smashed plantains which are the best."}
{"text":"I ordered from here from Uber Eats late on a Friday evening not expecting much. I was actually surprised how tasty my meal was! I ordered the Achiote Roasted chicken meal with coleslaw and rice and beans, the chicken was moist and really nice. I ordered the mini donuts for dessert and they were so tasty! same with the key lime pie. I would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and good services. High calories meal but really good. My favourite is press cubano sandwich"}
{"text":"I grabbed a slow roasted pork shoulder plate and conch fritters. First the plate, which included a roasted and spiced pork shoulder I only previously thought was only possible within my dream state, a perfectly crunchy slaw with a subtle twist, mouthwatering rice and beans and some fried plantains. The conch fritters were on par with previous experiences, a big plus was that the batter was lighter than I am used to. The flavors were perfectly balanced, the confluence of textures embraced perfection and the service surpassed all reasonable expectation. The plantains could have been a little fresher, but they were still delicious and completely forgiveable.  This wasn't my first run at Cuban food, and it certainly wont be my last. The only real negative to this establishment is that it will be hard to beat. As an aside, big ups to the salty Tinder match that originally urged me with angst and vigor to eat here, you will not be forgotten you tooth breaker."}
{"text":"Love their chips & salsa. Definitely not the typical chips & salsas around town, really reminds me of the ones ive had in South America 

I'll definitely go back to try their cocktails"}
{"text":"Aesthetically pleasing restaurant with delicious food. I had the pineapple fish which was very tasty. The coconut shrimp appetizer was amazing as were the plantains - just the right balance of sweet and salty.
The staff seemed a little rushed but still friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Spontaneously entered this resto after walking by it with Jocelynne and it was the best decision we made all week. I ordered the guava bbq beef short rib cuban plate ($15.99 and served with red cabbage slaw, rice and beans, and tostones). The tostones (fried plantain) was a bit drier than I had hoped for, but the salt added enough flavour. The slaw is made with vinegrette (not mayo) so a good side for vegans! But my favourite parts were the beef and rice and peas. The beef was cooked to the T, and fell riiiight off the bone. The rice and peas were sooo flavourful that Jocelynne and I would literally order a side of it to eat by its own. The plate was extremely filling and I hiiighly recommend you to visit this place because lord knows we will both be back in the new year!!! Peep the pic I posted to see what this dish looks like."}
{"text":"This is a really cool restaurant. Entering the place you feel like you're going back in time into a 60's diner. We tried the chicken and short rib sandwiches. They were both great. The short rib was specially my favorite. Neither sandwiches were not really hot but nevertheless great. We also got the conch fritters and tostetas. They had a fantastic habanero sauce that complemented everything we had. We could only find seats at the bar and the service was great. Also best of all, the prices were amazing for the quality.

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Price: 5/5
Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"4.5!!!

This place is bombbbbbb! The service was great and the food even better.  Loved the decor, which reminded me of the show Dexter lol

Highly recommend this place for great Cuban food.  

Only thing is a tad expensive but so is every place in the city that is good."}
{"text":"I spotted this little hole in the wall Cuban joint while going for a lazy afternoon drive and decided to stop by for a sandwich. I was thoroughly glad I took the time to look around the charming neighbourhoods of Toronto. 
 
I'm immediately greeted with a mouthwatering aroma, vibrant yet relaxing Cuban music and a friendly face. Coupled with a perfect balance of vintage and modern interior design, it's easy to forget you're not in sunny old Havana.

I bought a few of their \"classic\" pressed Cubanos ($10.99) and some Yuca frites ($4.99). At first glance, I was a tad bit disappointed at the amount of food you get compared to the fairly hefty price tag. As I scarfed down the greasy, meaty sandwich I soon realized that I was getting more bang for my buck than I'd realized. The Cubano itself was a compressed hunk of meats and other sandwich essentials, lightly buttered and piping hot. The Yuca frites with garlic dip were similar to yams and definitely a nice change from the standard potato and ketchup. 

Yet again, I yearn for Yelp to implement half stars in their rating system. However, I'm willing to give La Cubana 5 stars. After all, it's got the sights, sounds, smells, and definitely the taste. La Cubana has an absolutely charming look, comforting atmosphere that almost transports you to another time and place. Last but not least they have great food (albeit hefty price and slightly lacking portions). 

Needless to say, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich and a side of rice and beans. The food is good, but it really seems overpriced for such small portions. I don't usually like to complain about price because I get that everyone has to make a living in an expensive city but still...

The service is good. Very friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. We didn't try the drinks but the cocktails seemed intriguing. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cool, quiet little place. I had just watched season 3 of Narcos (which is pretty good btw) and was in the mood for some Latino home cooked meals. This place didn't disappoint in terms the atmosphere. It makes you really feel the Latin vibe. 

The service was excellent. They recommend stuff if you haven't been here before and were really helpful in there descriptions. Needless to say, everyone there was really nice. 

On to the food, my girlfriend got the pressed cubano and that was amazing. The cheese and the bread and everything inside was just so gooood. I, on the other hand, had the short rib dinner. Wasn't too impressed with this one. It tasted really good on first bite, but after that it needed some flavour. Also, the rice came with way too many beans. Kind of over powering if you ask me. And then we tried the Yuca fries, which were okay. Again, just my opinion but I would prefer the regular fries. But if you're willing to try something new and different, definitely try the Yuca fries. 

Overall, cool experience with some pretty good food"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment with group of women of color (12 in total) at night. We had a nice time and the food was good. One thing to note is that we were told that they couldn't do separate bills and that an 18% gratuity would be charged. We accepted those terms. 

Towards the end of the night we asked the waitress, Alana, to take a picture of us when we noticed that a white male sitting at the bar was taking pictures of us without our consent on his personal phobe. We felt really uncomfortable and one of the members of our group asked him why was he taking pictures of us. The waitress, Alana, said on his behalf, that he was taking pictures of her not of us. However, one of the members of our group asked him to show us the pictures. The man had taken 9 pictures of us, not the waitress, without our consent. Our friend deleted the pictures, while the man complained and made nasty comments to us. The staff did nothing about this. 

This is a matter of safety for women. Photographing people without consent is not only illegal, but dangerous. Particularly if the establishment does not consider this type of harassment an issue. And if the staff \"protects\" these people.

I would recommend women to be very careful when going to this establishment, since you won't necessarily be safe and the staff will not do much to guarantee your safety."}
{"text":"Rudest service I've ever experienced. Food was OK. 

It plays up its trendiness. Too bad their food doesn't match their style. It's a shame. Overpriced. But meh, it's always packed with yuppies trying to go for a bit of \"cultured\" cuisine. All white people serving me...and in the kitchen. Go figure, couldn't find any real Cubans in Toronto?"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever had cuba food and It was quite delicious! This small restaurant is full of energy and a friendly staff. While waiting on our table, one of the cookers offered us some plantain chips he had just made since he over heard how hungry we were.

The patio is a small intimate setting, like eating in someones backyard on a summer night. This is  definitely a good date place to take someone.

The portions were small for the price they were asking for, but they were bursting with flavor. I would recommend the Guava BBQ short ribs, so tender it just melts in your mouth and the Habanero glazed calamari (best calamari I've had to date.) I found the appetizers were better than the entrees. The appetizers were full of complex flavours while the entrees were very one dimensional.

Overall, This place is good to have a good food and some drinks. But if you're waiting more than 15 mins for a seat, I would say go else where."}
{"text":"Soy enamorado con La Cubana, although I have never been there. La Cubana reminds you of a 50's diner with warm color scheme, fixtures, fares and vibes! Keep in mind this place doesn't take reservations, but the wait nonethless is worth it! Just be sure to give them your tel# and they'll text you once your table is ready. Since the front of the restaurant was jam packed with patrons waiting for the their tables, we decided to walk along Roncesvalles and check out the neighborhood. 
 
I ordered their Cuban Beer Pilsner with a twist of lime and a glass of water! no need for a jug this time :( 

For the food fare we ordered two apps: 
-Chorizo empanada: not your traditional, looked like a tart pie, topped off with raisins..quite a delight  
-Tostones Rellenos with Beef Picadillo, this was delish, lots of stuffing, perfect crust on the outside.
Main!! I had their Guava bbq beef short ribs with rice/ beans and ensalada on the side, presentation was beautiful, colorful, taste was bang on! the meat was tender, and overall perfect melody of flavors. Their portions were satisfying, and the prices were quite reasonable. 

If you're in Roncesvalle and happen to get the Cuban travel bug, or looking for something different, check this place out. buen trabaja!"}
{"text":"I've never had Cuban food before so I have no barometer to measure authenticity, but bearing that in mind, I had a really enjoyable meal! 
Decor and atmosphere is very nice, everything is neat and clean and there's a good vibe. 
Drinks were great, I ordered a guava fizz and husband got the raspberry lime ricky. It's rare that a restaurant offers a good variety of mock tails that are not just virgin versions of existing cocktails, so that was nice. The drinks were super refreshing and delicious.
For our meal I had gotten the presses Cubana and the much talked about yuca fries. I enjoyed both. I was worried that with the varieties of pork in the sandwich it may be salty, but that wasn't the case. Filling, gooey cheese, great bread, no complaints. The yuca fries were also good. Nicely fried and not greasy, the garlic aioli was delicious, a definite strong garlic flavour but needed as the actual yuca doesn't offer much flavour. My husband got the short rib plate and the conch fritters. The short rib had great flavour and was very tender. The conch fritters were tasty and not greasy. 
Overall I had a good experience and would come back to try more dishes"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband and really enjoyed it. Polite staff, and great food. The vegetarian option was creative and hearty. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Quite during the day. Good pulled pork and soft buns.  Also, matching of mango hot sauce and craft cerveza made for La Cubana went well. Sides a little over priced, didn't try due to it."}
{"text":"We had dinner there with the whole family and *LOVED* it. Refreshing, tasty, and nice portion sizes.

The only thing I don't get, is with the redesigned floor space, it only sits 30, and there were 9 employees working there. With $7 meals on the menu, I just don't get how the math adds up. I guess the idea is that you're not supposed to stay too long? But still, even with a full house and fast turnover, I don't see how they could break even at those staffing levels. Maybe the plan is to raise prices once they've established themselves?

I highly recommend eating here. Delightfully different from the other fare on the strip. Neat atmosphere (though with the bright lights and shiny tiles it almost feels like you're in a big washroom...) The food's really good, you can't beat the price, and the wait staff are super nice."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place on Ossignton strip. The place is usually packed during brunch time but there are seats in the back of the restaurants.

I ordered the pork shoulder which I thought was cooked really well but it lacked flavour. It came with rice and slaw which also lacked flavour but I suppose this is Cuban food and thats just the way it is.

The supplemented us with a jar of hot sauce. Much needed and made the food alot better. I drenched my food with the hot sauce. I have high tolerance for hot sauce and I love hot sauce. 

If you cant tolerate hot sauce I suggest bringing something to put on your food to add flavour."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday. Super quick service. Ordered the short rib plate and the pork belly medianoche. Bother we're super delicious. The pork belly was knockout (chewy, crunchy, cartelized). Would highly recommend. Also fun to split. The plate wasn't as hot as it should have been, but I'm not even mad. Thank you for coming to the east end!!!"}
{"text":"I think the decor, service, presentation were all very good/excellent.
The strong negative (3 stars, not a 4 or 5 star rating) is the PRICES.
The chicken, pork meals; $16.  Very small portion of chicken/pork.  The rice is excellent, some of the best I've ever tried.  If this was $10-12 we would return, at the current price, a one time experience, albeit enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with our experience here given that most of the other reviews for this place are so great. 

The food was okay. It was edible but very lacklustre. I got the pork belly plate, it looked good, but everything except the coleslaw and pineapple salsa was a bit bland. It was like the fattiest piece of thing I've ever been served at a restaurant, and that's fine but it really was really lacking in taste. The super duper small fibres of meat that I did get at the bottom of the pork belly were really tasty though. One of my friends liked his sandwich, but everyone else at the table felt like their food was just 'meh'.

We felt like we weren't really welcome there. We wanted to get drinks but the server wouldn't even wait for us to finish talking before he left. This happened multiple times. He was super impatient with us and the girl behind the counter was friendly to other patrons but she pretty much rushed us out of the restaurant after we finished eating."}
{"text":"La Cubana for one is decorated very nicely. Very cute spot for quick filling food before having a night out. I ordered a salad, and my friend ordered the chicken to go. The food was good, nothing stood out about it. But I would ordered again."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I love their classic Cuban sandwich - the best I've ever tried - and the really nice decor. The beer is good, the yucca is crispy, the squid is spicy, and the service has always been good. The prices are really reasonable, too. It's small and sometimes has a wait, but thats the nature of the beast. You can see much of the food prep area, so you know it's clean. Overall, it's really excellent."}
{"text":"I love a good Cuban sandwich. I've visited Miami and think I've tried some pretty decent contenders, and this place holds up to what they offer there. 

The Pressed Cubano is what to order if you want to stay safe, but try something a little different and treat yourself to the Pork Belly Medianoche. This was the standout from the things we tried. 

The Cuban Burger was interesting, the Tostones were very tasty, and the rice and beans were par for the course. Quaint little place without prevention and definitely worth the trip if you're in the mood for some delicious Cuban cuisine."}
{"text":"The decor is great, the food is ok, the prices are pretty crazy. 

I got the avocado salad for $10 and the black bean soup for $6. The avocado part of the avocado salad was not ripe enough, so quite hard and I couldn't eat that part.  The rest of the salad was just dressed greens, a few hearts of palm, and a few citrus slices. It was decent but sparse. The black bean soup was ok - thick, not remarkable, and on the small side. It was a pretty sparse basic meal that I paid $18 for without even a drink.

My friend got a sandwich that looked pretty good but pretty small for $9 and then a non-alcoholic drink for $5 and $15 seems a bit much for that too. The decor is great -- really nice tile, colonial cafeteria vibes. If you go here, I would say get a full plate of ribs or something for the same $15 and you've done better on it"}
{"text":"the food is delicious, but going to this place is a constant gamble. on Numerous occasions i have called to order food for pick up and once i arrived they had given my order to someone else / or foodora/ uber etc... it isnt like i took for ever to get there being i only live UP THE STREET, Another time i ordered for pick up bought two plates, went home and opened the side of rice and beans and both of them were less then half full ...complete bullshit. considering the price of this place the plates should be filled to the TOP ! . Ossington is a busy area so prepare for that if you are going to run a business on a busy street.. they run out of food HOURS before closing .. its insane."}
{"text":"Cool place. I was here just before a movie at the Revue and quickly had a 1/2 pint of La Cubana beer and the grilled coconut shrimp. Place was quite busy.  Limited menu but what was on it looked tasty. They have only been open a few weeks and are still finding their way, so be patient, I think this place could be great addition to the neighborhood.  Service was prompt, I sat at the bar.  Prices reasonable.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"The vibe:  If I tried really hard to ignore my heavy winter sweater that I was wearing and the grey skies through the windows, I might have thought I was in Cuba. This place is a really bright, fun atmosphere with great music and beautiful design. From the gorgeous tile floors to the graphic design on their menu, this place screams \"instagram me\". 

The food: I've come here for brunch and lunch and have been nothing short of amazing, especially since the prices are so reasonable. I've tried the Cuban Cord (delicious!), the corn fritter appetizers (oh my!), the beef rib sandwich, and chicken sandwich. All of it was delicious. And don't forget the donuts for dessert! 

My go-to meal: Short rib sandwich.

Secret: If you order chocolate chip cookies for dessert, they come warm...fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place for a weekend brunch!  However, they're also open late during the week, if you ever get a craving!

I love the pressed Cubano sandwich - it's buttery, with savoury ham and spicy whole grain mustard!  Also a fan of the Cuban Medianoche, which is the Cubano on a delicious soft bun.  If you're vegetarian, the Veggie Medianoche is great as well, very fresh and healthy - the queso fresco is so good!

My only complaint is that I feel it has been inconsistent lately, for example I used to love the Cafe con Leche, it was strong and super sweet.  Last time I went, it was not sweet at all, like a Cuban coffee should be."}
{"text":"We're never disappointed when go for a meal. The atmosphere and comfortable surroundings make us feel nostalgic. The smells of fried plantains and corn frituras are in the air. Cubano coffee flowing,mmmm .
We had French toast with bananas, Cubano sandwich with fried plantains and corn frituras. Great service and memories. 
Thank you La Cubano."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but the service was so disappointing here that I wanted to share.

Visited La Cubana for the first time this weekend, we arrived at 3:45pm only to be turned away by a staff member, as they claimed they weren't ready to serve additional customers until 4:00pm (the website says \"regular menu 3pm - late\"). No \"sorry\" or anything, just asked us to return in 15 mins. There were other people seated from earlier but they didn't want anyone else to come in until after 4:00pm. OK, no problem, so we took a walk down Roncesvalles and returned at 4:00.

Begrudgingly, the same girl pointed us to a seat, but again no \"thanks for waiting\" for \"sorry for the wait\". 

We sat down - awesome decor in this place, I love the look of it! - and a different staff member brought us menus and water.

And then we waited... and waited... and waited... multiple other staff members walking by, they all looked busy but I'm not sure with what - (the place was maybe 1/2 full at this point).... we waited more than 20 MINUTES for our waitress (3rd staff member we'd met) to arrive at the table to say hi and ask if we'd like to order drinks / food. No apology, nothing about the MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES we sat at our table with nothing but water! We were literally discussing where else to go and eat, and were about to stand up and walk out. It's OK if issues arise that cause the staff to be busy - but you have to at least acknowledge it and apologize! 

The waitress was super friendly but seemed oblivious to the fact we'd been there so long, didn't acknowledge it at all. I understand if they're busy, but even saying \"hey I'm really sorry you guys had to wait, x y z was happening and we had to deal with that\" would have been welcomed. 

So we ordered, the waitress was helpful in answering our questions, and the waitress recommended an alternative to one of the sides (yuca fries instead of regular fries) - we agreed, this sounded great, let's try something a little different... but instead, we were served regular fries (by another staff member who delivered the food). The waitress returned several minutes later and was apologetic when I pointed out the discrepancy - and admitted she put the order in wrong (it's OK, mistakes happen).  She offered to order the yuca fries for us (but then we're ordering more food than we need, and at an additional charge) so we declined - would have been nice if she'd offered a freebie or something since it was her mistake. 

During the first half of the time we were there, when all the staff was running around busy (but with what was unclear, because we were definitely ignored) - we noticed a staff member was COUNTING CASH from the til while sitting right at the counter (where customers would usually sit), right on display, out in the open. I found this extremely tacky, especially following all the waiting and poor service (if any) we'd received. Please consider counting your cash BEHIND the counter at least! It is beyond rude and distasteful to do this within eye shot of pretty much every customer there, since you're sitting right at the counter.

As for the food itself, it's good - we ordered the pineapple glazed pork belly medianoche and the short rib medianoche - lots of flavour, but the toppings kind of overpowered the taste of the meat itself, in both cases. More filling than it looked, fortunately. We also ordered a couple of the drinks on the menu, and for $10 each they were tiny, and nothing notable - boozy but that's about it. The mint in the mojito required muddling with a drinking straw. The little cinnamon donuts at the end were nice - hot, sweet, really pleasant - and I'm glad the waitress suggested them. 

Honestly, the several examples of poor service we'd experienced at that point overshadowed our experience of the food. :( It's a popular place on Ronces, though, and I have no doubt they'll have continued success... just wish they had better trained their staff, and better organized their service overall. Won't be back anytime soon because of this, felt like customer service was the bottom priority."}
{"text":"Great pressed cubano & yuca frita wedges
Drink special today was an 8.00 Mojito 
Perfect whens 34C outside!"}
{"text":"What a gem among tons of restaurants on Ossington Ave!! Stopped in after an endless search for a lunch spot. The moment you walk in you feel like you've been taken back to the 1950s--with the large booths, turquoise and silver colors, soda machines, and swing music. The menu is up and behind the counter in the back and features tons of native Cuban dishes. I decided on the cuban burger and red cabage slaw. The burger was cooked to perfection with tons of spices and an amazing spicy mayo topped with the red cabbage slaw. The slaw was full of flavor as well with vinegar and a touch of sweetness! 

I would give it 4 stars, but the customer service was non existent. I was never checked on after my food was dropped off. And then went to ask for a to go box I was ignored and then the box was given to me by a lady who had a not so nice face for me. I feel that you can get good Cuban food at a lot of places, so your customer service and attitude should be just as great as your food."}
{"text":"My first time at this location although not my first time at La Cubana - I'm happy to report it's still great no matter what one you choose! I took my mother for brunch a few weekends ago and we both had the la Cubano sandwich (succulent pork, fantastic grilled bread and melted cheese, it's just what you need for brunch!) and shared a side of the Cuban corn. The corn was a little bit on the small side, although of course, it was delicious, I would recommend getting one each because you won't want to share! We went around 2 pm so it was busy but not crazy crowded, and waited 10 minutes or so for a table."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. The food was so tasty and very authentically Cuban! If you're looking for comfort food, this is a great joint. The short rib platter was delicious. I recommend trying the Cuban lager and the espresso on the menu. All in all, a great experience. Will definitely be returning here for a dinner or lunch in the future!"}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful retro decor, and varied menu. Have returned several times and sampled several menu items: most recently, we had the bean and cheese empanadas and the chips and salsa, all of which were incredible. The fish sandwich was terrific! I don't seem to be able to stray from the periodista, as far as cocktails go. It may not be traditional Cuban cuisine but it's delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have eaten here twice. I have had the black bean soup, the jicama salad and the fish plate. All three are really delicious and filling but the fish plate is a whole other level. It's so fresh and cooked just perfectly, I love the sides that are with it as well. The restaurant itself is cute and cozy and the staff are super friendly. The prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Being from NY I'm completely in love with Latin food. I was super excited to try La Cubana after reading these reviews. The décor was adorable, however the way La Cubana services their food was rather unfortunate.

I was with 3 other people and we all ordered: drinks, apps and entrées.  It took about 7 mins for us to receive our juices. 2 people received their appetizers at a reasonable time but one person received their entree. No biggie, we are all in our 20s and did not want to complain. 20 mins past and still the remaining appetizers were not served and the other 3 main dishes. 

The point of going out to eat with your friends is to enjoy a meal together. 

After complaining about the service, the waitress never apologized for the wait or the fact that half only half of the appetizers arrived within 25-30 mins of placing our order.

After the long wait, the grilled fish was bland.

Next time I'm in Toronto I will pass on Cuban food."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a large group of people for private birthdays in the backroom. Thanks so much for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! My first time trying Cuban. Although they can improve on their kids meal menu: grilled cheese and fries?!  My 7-yr-old was quite disappointed with that. I know it's a safe item but our kids are quite ok to try different cuisines and They actually liked the rice and Bbq there.  Overall good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The décor is so cute, makes you feel like you are in Cuba. The service was good, but it did take a little long to put our orders in, but it was a little busy, even at 5:30pm. 

They had a bunch of sandwiches and plates on their menu, basically anything you can get on a plate, you can get in a sandwich. The three of us decided to get 3 different plates to share. The pork shoulder, the braised short ribs and the fish. All were great, but the short ribs were particularly excellent. Highly recommend that. All the plates come with coleslaw, rice and beans and tostones (flattened plantain and fried up.. so delicious).

Got an order of the donuts for dessert. They were good, but a little too cakey for my liking - but still good. They're hot and coated in a cinnamon sugar. Their coffees are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Brunch with friends after far too long and this was the perfect spot. Decor is reminiscent of an old diner with a counter with stools and a few tables. Service was very courteous, friendly and quick. Although they \"forgot\" my order, they quickly rectified it!
I ordered a cafe con leche and it was smooth, creamy and delicious.
My main was the Guava BBQ beef short rib plate. Absolutely delicious. Tender beef with a great variety of sides. Lightly pickled red cabbage, rice and beans and tostones. Comes topped with crispy onions. If you like heat the hot sauce is made in house and definately worth trying. All for just over $20.00. 
So much food that I had leftovers which I enjoyed later in the day!"}
{"text":"I met up here with some old friends last night. Scored a great seat by the window... We ordered a bunch of Bocaditos to share with the table... Everything we ate was awesome... The Standouts were the the Beef Short Ribs & Tostones Rellenos.

Service was spot on and very attentive. Olivia was our main server and was also fun to talk to... The chef came over during our meal to make sure all was well and the service was a group effort with everyone helping out.  Will 100% be back soon...  Highly recommend it. Great vibe and interesting menu. Not a lot of Cuban food in Toronto so I would definitely check this out."}
{"text":"First off, they get major points for great decor.  It looks like Cuba, but better.  And thankfully, the food is better (at least from what I hear).  

The main thing I order is the Pressed Cubano which is indeed generally a very nice sandwich.  Depending on who's making it, sometimes the mustard and pickle combo can be a bit jarring flavorwise, but it's almost always very good.  The Cuban Burger is also very tasty.  A useful tip is that it is seasoned with smoked paprika, so no, your ground pork is not pink.  We asked in a panic...now you don't have to.  

The beer on offer is pretty bad, and their house lager/pilsner tastes like PBR or a bit worse.  It looks like they have some really great happy hour deals (although happy hour stops at 6) which are main + drink for around $10.  Should give that a try.

Overall, a nice place for a casual bite."}
{"text":"Looking for lunch revealed this gem of a place. Both the inside and the patio in the back is lovely, with the friendly service moving around seamlessly between all the patrons happily munching down on brunch. The space is bright and cheery, with plenty of seating to accommodate different group sizes.

I had the Traditional Medianoche, which is a large sandwich with pork, ham, gruyere, and a runny egg between a soft egg bun. The sides include a pile of red cabbage coleslaw, rice and beans and two large tostones, which means that there is more than enough food even for a hungry brunch meal.  Corn frituras makes a good share item, the inside is soft and fluffy while the outside is well fried."}
{"text":"So first of being raised in miami for 21 years I can say I really know cuban food, not to mention being a chef from miami where I cooked tons of cuban food. First and foremost the cuban sandwich is on CUBAN BREAD not sliced bread, if you can't find cuban bread fine use something similar but not sliced bread, also no whole grain mustard is ever used on the cuban or is  onions a cuban sandwich is simple roasted pork, ham, swiss,pickles,mustard on la plan cha  press not panini press until crispy.  Next is the medianoche it's on a sweet sub roll not burger roll as it was served to my wife. Tostones are fried until super crisp and salted immediately out of the fryer not soggy and served with no salt. Maduros or sweet plantains one need to be very ripe and nice and soft and sweet not fried super crispy dry and salted. Cafe con Leche I won't even go there nothing was right there. If this is your attempt at cuban it was a very poor try I really really wanted to like it I was so excited when my wife told me there was a cuban spot in toronto as I just moved here but no where near what it should be do some research guys."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, nice service,  and at a great price. Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a Saturday night for a dinner in their patio and it was great! Had a mojito each (not too sweet as in other places), ordered a side of plaintains, the pork shoulder and their cubano sandwich. No complaints whatsoever!  They were all delicious! On the not-so-good side, we wanted to try the empanadas and they didn't have any left. Prices are OK and the staff friendly. We didn't have a reservation but we waited only for about 10-15 mins and you don't have to stay there, they text when you're table is ready.
I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Super tasty, great ambience, try The Medianoche. Anthony is bomb, the house hot sauce  authentic and sweet fire"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here last night after walking all the way from Little Portugal and encountering many lines and places unaccommodating of vegetarians like myself. The place is no frills look and has a old school dinner feel with a little cuban influence thrown in - green tiled walls, some small booths, tables and seats at the metal counter.

I ordered the vegetarian plate and my friend got the guava BBQ plate. It was divine! I was pleasantly surprised because it was so much better than I expected. Everything was wholesome, heathy and delicious. We were so impressed that we also decided to order a cuban coffee and the key lime bar for desert. This was also a knockout - a large portion and really rich and decadent.

Aside from the food there was a nice vibe in there. The place was full, the staff were friendly, humorous and relaxed and it smelled great. I didn't really baulk at the prices. While the restaurant itself is not fancy the food is value for money (particularly for the area). I'm definitely going to come back here and also check out their Roncy location."}
{"text":"We had the fish sandwich, and rib medianoche with sides of plantain and yuca frita.  In retrospect, the fish sandwich was a risky choice - but it turned out great! The medianoche was pretty good as well. The addition of the pineapple salsa was unusual but delicious. The yuca frita was very filling and the plantains were perfect. The back patio is nice! They had a tent up due to the heat but took it down as the sun set. Our waiter was polite and hip. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friend & I went here on Saturday, and I've been wanting to go here since I saw it on You've got to eat here. What a disappointment! The meat portions for the dinner dishes was small, I say about 4cm in length. We got the grilled fish & beef riblet. The tostones were on the dry side & not even tasty! The appetizer we got the coconut shrimp. It was 4 pieces on 1 skewer, the sauce was nice. It would have been better if bread came with it. 

We chose a seat at the back, figuring it would be warmer...big mistake ! They had the back door opened, it would have been nice if they closed it. It was warmer by the cooks. I don't think I would come back here!! There are better restaurants on Roncey. I don't know what all the hype about this place."}
{"text":"This was seriously delicious! No reservations but we rolled in with a group 4 or maybe 5 or maybe we'll be 6? And the waitress who would have been well within her rights to roll her eyes just smiled and gave us a table for 6 in the front and happily started bringing us Cuban beers.

Everyone loved their food - I would go back and order one of each app just to try. The crispy spicy sweet calamari was my favourite, followed closely by the guava short ribs.

Lovely bright room, easy going friendly staff, and food so good I couldn't stop talking and thinking about it means I have to give this experience 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have no idea how it's taken me this long to try La Cubana, especially since I'm in the area fairly regularly. (The consequence of being located so close to Bang Bang.)

Anyway, I'd heard good things about the Pressed Cubano (\"ham, pork, gruyere, red onion, cornichon, grainy mustard, mayo\"), so obviously that was what I had to get.

It's spectacular, to be perfectly blunt. The sandwich arrives piping hot and the cheese is irresistibly melty, with the pressed bread giving the whole thing a fantastic crunch. Every item in there works perfectly together and there's a flawless proportion of each.

This has instantly become one of my favorite sandwiches in the city, and I can't wait to try some of La Cubana's other offerings."}
{"text":"I'd been to the Ossington location several months back and had the absolutely spectacular Pressed Cubano Sandwich, so when the Roncey outpost was suggested, I couldn't help but jump at the chance to sample their wares.

We decided to start with the Corn Frituras, which I suppose is the Cuban version of hush puppies. Anyway, these are phenomenal. The texture is crispy on the outside and perfectly pillowy on the inside, while the filling is packed with delicious flavors. The included dipping sauce is a perfect accompaniment, too.

For my main, I went with the Guava BBQ Beef Short Rib. This is a heck of a platter, and it comes with an stomach-bursting amount of food. The beef short rib, though perhaps a little too fatty, is unbelievably tender and the sauce is irresistible. The plate also comes with delectable rice and beans, an above-average purple cabbage salad, and a couple of deep-fried plantains. Really, really good.

I was completely full but we inexplicably decided to order dessert, as well. We got the simply-named Donuts and they were, no surprise, amazing. They're presented as donut holes, essentially, and they were perfectly cooked and presented, while the accompanying cream-cheese-and-caramel dip is lick-the-container-until-it's-empty delicious.

La Cubana seems to be flying under the radar a little bit in Toronto, and it's a shame given that it appears to be one of the very best and most consistent restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Came in late night. We to wait 30+ minutes to get a seat. Bar area is seating, so you can't order a drink while you wait. 

Found out about the restaurant in a in-flight magazine for Porter. I was super stoked to try a place featured in a magazine in the neighborhood I grew up. 

Fantastic ambiance. The music & decor took me right back to Cuba. I had a fairly large grin about this. Great service, and the food arrived quite quickly. We stayed until they closed up the place. My only complaint is the \"La Cubana\" beer. It was flat, and room temperature. I did mention this to the waitress, and she gladly replaced it with a cocktail instead. She only charged me for the price of the beer, which also saved me 3 bucks. 

What I had: 

Tropical Chips and Salsa ($6): You can't really tell from the menu what this is. It's plantain chips with a very fresh, citrusy & spicy salsa. I recommend this! 

Peirodista ($10): A tart cocktail, paired well with the tropical chips & salsa

Cuba Libre ($10): My favorite cocktail offered. I could have drank 5 of these (if it wasn't for the price)

Pressed Cubano Sandwich ($9): The sandwich was ooey-gooey-goodness. I couldn't finish it, so I took half of it home. The next morning I wished I had a whole extra sandwich to eat again. Good eats!

Buttermilk Donuts: They were okay. Nothing too special, but a nice way to end a meal. 

Carajillo ($10): This was my friend's cocktail, but he was tired & didn't want the alcohol. His wife and I split it, while eating the donuts. The two paired together is a good way to end your meal. 

Wish I could have tried them for brunch. They look like they have much more on their menu that would perk my interest. Once I go back to Toronto to visit family, I will go back. Have already suggested it to several friends. The staff is friendly, the mood is relaxing & the food makes your tastebuds dance. The cocktails may be a touch pricey, but at least they're authentic for a Cuban restaurant."}
{"text":"So happy one opened here in the East end! Just like it's predecessors, food is delicious. The pork belly or shoulder plate is highly recommended! Complement it with a refreshing drink."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork meal. The pulled pork was SO yummy and tasty along with the Mojito we drank, it was a perfect cuban meal."}
{"text":"First off, this is not authentic Cuban food because it is actually SOO DELICIOUS!!!!!!! asdfwjeljfao*(&#*&^$(*&$#!!

I hope the owners don't take offense to that haha
I was in Cuba twice, and never encountered food near in the league of what this place served.

I ordered the guava-glaze roast, and on my goodness it's just so savoury and yummy and thinking about it is making me hungry.

It came with fried plantains (yum!), a big generous portion of rice and beans (thank you!), and some picked cabbage thing which was just so perfectly acidic to balance out the meal.

Serving sizes are pretty huge. Really amazing comfort food. I'd come here more if it wasn't so far."}
{"text":"If we had a choice we wouldn't come back. 
The mojito was missing the sweetness or any sugar. 
The \"cubano\" lacked any mustardy flavor, and i had to ask for some. All they had was a grain Dijon.  That's not Cuban.  
And what in the world is \"chipotle mayo\" doing on my sandwich?? We're not in Mexico or the southwest America. The bread itself was toast slices not a Cuban pressed baguette-like style. 
My husband got the chicken and kept pulling out cartilage pieces. I get it, it's fresh off the bone, but don't leave the bone in there! Again he at least was smart enough to request no chipotle mayo in his \"Cuban\" torta. 
The yuka Frita would have been perfect if it wasn't doused in some cheesy creamy sauce. It was perfectly fried, crispy and salty goodness."}
{"text":"La Cubana elicits one word from me every time I go in: WOW! First, the actual building, location and decor are fantastic. It's far enough away from both Dundas and Queen that there's more foot traffic than street traffic, keeping noise and pollution to a minimum when the doors are open on a hot day.

When you get inside you're greeted by white and pastel green everything with pops of red on the menus and painted signs along the walls. Cute cute cute. 

Now the food: I swear by the pork shoulder plate and would choose it as my last meal. Your serving comes piled high with meat that just melts apart. While the pork is the star of the show it has a great supporting cast including their red cabbage slaw, rice with beans and tostones (which were the best I've ever had).

Washed it all down with their fantastic red sangria. It was a little on the strong side but for a Friday afternoon that was exactly what I needed. I wish I could give 6 stars!"}
{"text":"Never had cuban food before...but the cubano made me a beliver.  Great food that almost literally melted in my mouth.  Great decor and feel...and experience worth repeating.  Prices reasonable for the quality. Yuca is definately worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Oh, you lucky people.  

You've stumbled upon a perfectly curated environment of delicious.     

Someone once told me that the simple metric for what makes a restaurant good is when you find a place where you cannot make the food on your own at home. This is that kind of place. 

Everything is delicious.   It's a no-filler menu.   And the standout items are just nuts.   Like the Shortrib Medinoche.   Or the Yuca Fries.  Or the Buttermilk Donuts.   Or the homemade Hot Sauce.  Dude.  Just pour it into my open head.  

I unabishedly love this spot.   It might be my favorite casual restaurant in the city.  And this location is the East End is perhaps even better than the other two.    It's easier to get a table at, and has the best staff in the business.  

Just awesome."}
{"text":"It's incredibly difficult to put together a restaurant.

To get that mood, aesthetic and cuisine just perfectly right.  To get every note down to the music dead on. 

To effectively transport you to another place for a moment.  

It's not fancy, but it's perfect for what it is. 

Strong recommend."}
{"text":"Nomz! Came here with some friends for a late lunch, and loved it. It's the perfect little Roncy lunch spot.

Black cherry soda + fish sandwich + tostones... Perfect meal. I really have nothing bad to say about the food.

The place was decked out in seafoam green tiles, white walls, and red leather seating. It looked like a diner from the 60's, which is probably a nod to Havana's Art Deco buildings that are still around today. Service was adequate, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We had the veggie plate, pork shoulder plate and a side and it was absolutely amazing. The habanero Caesar was incredible and the perfect amount of spice! They don't have table service, which I kinda liked as it made it significantly less pretentious.. A rarity in Toronto restaurants."}
{"text":"the food was absolutely amazing. no complaints. best coleslaw I've ever had.. the chicken and pork belly were really good. they use an amazing chutney for the pork belly which is a bit spicy but amazing. the the plantain and rice was yummy too..
 however you must try the Yuka  frita it was to die for!!! the price was a bit steep.. for two lunches and one guava juice we paid $45.00 but I would say it was worth it"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give this place a try as it was something new - brunch with a Cuban flare. The moment I walked in, I really liked the feel of the place. It gave you a nice bright and fresh morning feel, which is what you would want to feel on a Saturday morning for brunch. The decor in this place is like a dinner, I thought it was cute. We were three people, me, my boyfriend and our roommate. We didn't get a table, instead we sat at the bar. The servers were all very nice and friendly. However, the food, I thought was average. I did really like the pickled raisins - wished they had more on the plate. They don't have drip coffee (which I was a bit unhappy about as I am one of those people that must have coffee with my brunch) so instead I ordered an americano. The americano was so-so, the flavors wasn't bold enough. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in the area. There's never a huge wait, and the food is very savoury - it's actually an awesome choice for brunch if you're unwilling to wait in the crazy lines of nearby over-rated brunch places, but it opens at noon. My go-to is the breakfast sandwich, which I'm not sure is even on the menu. The only reason I know about it is because I've been around since they were piloting this item, and I voted for it to stay on the menu. It's basically the cuban medianoche with an egg inside, and believe me the egg really makes a difference! If they don't have it, just ask for cuban medianoche and add an egg. The pressed cubano and black bean soups are also very good. I'm obsessed with how they make their coffee here, probably because I like it strong and sweet. I do have to mention that I much preferred La Cubana maybe a year ago, when it seemed more authentic Cuban and the workers were hispanic and so warm and friendly - I would've given it 5/5 stars if it was the same! For the past year, it seems like management has changed, and that La Cubana is now trying to fit in more with the \"hipster\" culture of the surrounding area. To be honest, the food has been less flavourful and inconsistent since then. But overall, I still enjoy this place and I think it's a gem if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"The server was very nice In tune with the style of the place !  It has this lovely vibe like you are traveling back in time with the music from pulp fiction . I got the grilled fish sandwich with avocado and diced pineapple on house made milk bun. The grilled tilapia has a nice smoky flavor fresh off the grill but sadly is under seasoned .  But the worst part is the bun it was very dense seems the moisture just trapped inside the bun and made it sort of gummy texture like under baked and it might be better if it were put on flat top and buttered it . Flavor wise since it was under seasoned made it taste bland . Maybe add some mayo would work ...

Cappuccino was excellent ."}
{"text":"A must go! First of all, I'd like to shout out the staff! Honestly, some of the most friendly, smiling faced servers I've experienced in Toronto restaurants. It has sort of an old dinner feel, just feels comfortable and casual.
During a Sunday stroll we popped in to share a short rib sandwich (with delicious slaw) 'to go' and immediately wished I got my own! Lol 
Can't wait to go back and run through the menu. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Totally down for the Cuban-styled breakfast, especially if you're as hungry as I was at 2pm. To me, the portion and rice almost reminds me of a meal you'd eat for dinner. It's quite heavy for breakfast at 10am, which is when they began serving brunch up until 3pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Although my friend and I were completely starved we actually enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the chefs prepare everyone's dish. There were only 2 chefs but they moved quickly. Every dish was served with rice & beans, tostones (fried plaintain slices) and slaw. The dark purple slaw added so much color to the plate. When you sit by the bar you literally see them prepare each dish, making it increasingly difficult to decide what I wanted. All the items on their menu look and sound so delicious. I had to change my dish twice before I was completely satisfied with my choice. I ended up selecting the Cuban styled-breakfast which the waitress said was a popular item. It came with slow roast pork and poached eggs ($14), while my friend went for my initial pick of pork belly with pineapple glaze and sunny side up eggs ($13). The meat was juicy and tender, simply melted in your mouth. We washed it all down with a cup of Cafe Con Leche ($4), which is a Cuban style of a latte with brown sugar on the bottom. The tostones were our less favourite. It was bland and didn't do much to the meal but added some bready texture. It was too dry. I never tried Cuban food before, and not too sure how authentic it is. Service was also great at the Roncy location. She was friendly, attentive and quick. We're so glad we checked this place out."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this cute place! It has a diner feel to it when you walk in. Staff was friendly and efficient.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich, which was pretty good but the ones I've had in Miami still have my heart! Hubs got the chicken medianoche which was pretty good too, especially if you love avocado in your sandwich. We also got the yuca frittas and conch fritters as sides. The yuca frittas were good and not covered in thick batter but I would have liked them a bit crispier. The conch fritters had the right amount of spice and were perfect with the mayo type sauce it came with. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"One of the gems on Roncesvalles, have always had a great experience here and the one night we didn't, they comped our whole meal.

We've ordered several things on the menu and they are all good.  Best rum drinks in the city.

Kind of a tricky place to go in the winter though as it's all about the patio at this place.  If you sit inside, prepare to be very hot and smell like food for the rest of the day.  Often crowded, best to go off peak times."}
{"text":"A fast way to get a delicious, unique meal on Ossington! I suggest the classic cubano sandwich and then a plate like the guava short rib! Amazing!  Will be coming back yo!"}
{"text":"This popular spot on Roncy is rightfully so. The decor is perfectly curated retro, with a definite dinner feel. We came here on a Sunday afternoon for late brunch...so late that it would even count as a late lunch (meaning 3pm). Even at this time of day, La Cubana was full and about to close. I think we got one of the last tables. 

Even with a shortened brunch menu, it was difficult to decide on a dish, but I finally set my mind to the pork belly with pineapple glaze, eggs and fried plantains. The pork belly was melt in your mouth tender with a savoury and sweet flavour. It came with a delicious pineapple salsa that complimented the pork perfectly. It added just enough tartness to balance the fatty belly. I personally didn't enjoy the eggs on the pork. It seemed like they just threw them on there because \"it's not brunch without eggs\", but you should decide for yourself. The fried plantains, pork belly and pineapple salsa were good enough, that I would order this dish again despite the egg addition."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for a quick dinner tonight.  Service was good and attentive.  She had the fish sandwich, I had the Traditional Medianoche, and we shared some Tostones.  The fish sandwich was nice, with the avocado adding some tasty fattiness.  The Traditional Medianoche was exactly what you'd expect, which meant it wasn't anything more than average.  The Tostones on the other hand were a bit of a disappointment.  Traditionally, Tostones are made from green/starchy plantains, but these had a sweet taste to them, so they were probably made with ripe/yellow plantains.  That type of plantain doesn't lend well to Tostones as the high sugar content causes them to brown and cook much faster and doesn't allow for the Tostones to get crispy and happy.

Overall, a very nicely presented restaurant with a clean interior, good service, average food."}
{"text":"No stars. Went here for dessert at 10:30 on a Saturday night and the hostess whose name I wish I remembered would't seat us in the empty tables as they were set for brunch. Told us we had to wait for a table and in fact made us wait 20 minutes standing in the doorway. The tables at the front were set with paper menus but wouldn't let us sit. Told us we had to wait for a table at the back. Then...  Kicked us out because we dared tell her it was poor service. The hostess actually told us to leave rather than seating us at a table set for brunch. Ridiculous and we won't return. Ever."}
{"text":"I visited La Cubana for brunch this weekend. I must say, from seeing the menu and the inside, I was quite excited. My girlfriend lives nearby, and I thought, \"Finally! Somewhere close by where I can get a tasty Cuban sandwich.\" Or, \"Finally! A place I can get brunch that won't leave things off the plate like Barque\"... After this visit, I can say that neither of these statements are true, but I believe this place has potential.

I got the chorizo hash with eggs. Most of the brunch meals come with beans and rice, cabbage, and tostones (fried plantain disc). Though sadly, my meal originally did not come with the rice and beans because they had run out. The waitress explained that they put some fries on my plate in its stead for now, but a side of rice and beans would be coming shortly. By the time we were done eating, the rice and beans had never shown up. We then inquired about them, and was told by a different server that I was given fries in its place, which is not what I was originally told. But you see, the issue at La Cubana is that they had a few servers serving the entire restaurant and did not have assigned tables. So when I was speaking to a server, it was an entire different server than the who had told me that a side of rice and beans was coming later. And why on earth would I want the rice and beans to be substituted with french fries when I had ordered the HASH. Yes please, just serve me an entire plate of fried potatoes. The good though, is that they did correct this error and brought me some rice and beans. Sure, they would have been better mixed in with some cabbage or egg or some of my hash for a little variety, but at least they came. The yuca potatoes in the hash were delicious and I liked them a lot. Everything else was pretty ok, except the tostones disc was kind of flavourless, and so was the little green salsa on top of it.

My girlfriend got the pressed Cuban sandwich. She is obsessed with the Cuban sandwich at Woody's, which is amazing, and this one pales in comparison. This one is more like a grilled cheese sandwich with some deli meat and jalapenos. It is greasy as well, like a greasy grilled cheese sandwich. While at Woody's, they pile pulled pork high on fresh bread made in house, and it's even cheaper. I wouldn't order the Cuban again.

We got the sweet plantains as well, and we both liked them. I might even say that they were a highlight of the meal.

Lastly, the place was packed. We had to wait for a table, and the kitchen is small and under staffed for a full house, so we had to wait a while for the food too. With this in mind, I wouldn't go back for brunch, because there are a handful of other brunch places that charge around 14 dollars a plate (Barque, Emma's Country Kitchen), that I would rather go to. I will go back and try some of the sandwiches in a takeout fashion (as they are 7 dollars), and if they can convince me their sandwich would be a better option than getting a subway sub, then they may have some repeat business on their hands."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mojito's, traditional Cuban food, my favorite item on the menu is the tilapia, but I have had their sandwiches, the staff is amazing they have a  patio outback, it's a great place for a date

The Decour inside of it is super cute and wonderful, I love the color it reminds me of stepping into the 50s diner, it's very cozy and always I've had a great experience there"}
{"text":"Sincerely THE best plate of food I have had in a long time, my friends. My boyfriend and I headed over to Roncy on one of the coldest days of the year just to re-live a little bit of Cuba after coming back from our trip there a few weeks ago. I had no idea that it was going to have a 50's St. Patrick-station-subway-tile diner-esque feel to it, but we dug it. When we walked in, the manager greeted us like we were old friends, and I knew we were onto something good.  

We ordered the grilled squid after our neighbouring table ordered 3 or 4 appetizers and told us it was their favourite. The calamari pieces were a medium size, tender but not chewy, and had a fantastic chipotle spice to them.  After 2 glasses of Guava juice (which has become my crack since leaving Cuba, I seriously fiend for the stuff) our mains arrived.  I love that every plate comes with red beans and rice and red cabbage slaw. And let me tell you, I don't know what they put in their RB&R, but dang does it pack a punch of flavour.  The red cabbage slaw also had a perfect tang and a little kick of spice. I ordered the Guava short rib (did I mention how much I like Guava?) which was tender, juicy, and and perfectly cooked. My boyfriend had the fish with pineapple salsa, which was also super tasty. We finished off the meal with pineapple upside-down cake and a key lime pie, which came more like a mousse, layered in a jar. 

Another great thing about their menu is most of the items can be ordered as an appetizer, a side, or a main, so you can try something as an appy once, and order as a main next time if you decide you dig it.  We can't wait to get back to this joint, it definitely tops our charts. Will report back on the brunch once we get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is the ambience - very Cuba 1950's style.  The Cuban sandwich is nowhere near what a real cuban sandwich should be - tiny and kind of tasteless.  Also pretty expensive, I'd go again for drinks but probably wouldn't get a meal there again."}
{"text":"What a great little find! We were looking for a quick lunch stop and we're so excited to find amazing food. It was crowded so we sat at the bar and we were greeted by Maria who made us some amazing fruity rum drinks...be carful they taste like juice! We shared the pork belly plate and a cuban...the rice and beans were perfect. We ended our amazing meal with chocolate natilla, creamy dark chocolate pudding with whipped cream. Will be back for more amazing food and to hang out with Maria!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had a late lunch at La Cubana this afternoon.  It's been there for about three years and I've walked by it about a million times but I've never stopped in.

I started with a Cuba Libre and Gord had a Raspberry Lime Rickey (non-alcoholic).  They were both so tasty that we ended up ordering a second.

Gord love love loves black bean soup and ordered one.  He said it was the best black bean soup he'd ever had.  I had a taste and it was good (I'm not a big soup eater).  It had a bit of a bite.

Gord also ordered a Cuban Medianoche.  They make the buns in-house and they were really soft and delicious.  He said it was a good sandwich and he'd get it again.

I ordered beans and rice and a Chicken Medianoche (without avocado) ... the bun was soft and the chicken was tender.  Both were really good and I'd get them again.

Warren was our server.  He was friendly, helpful and took good care of us.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. To be honest I didn't know what to expect with Cuban food.
Didn't make reservations and got seated for 2 right away. The cooks are the first people u see when u enter the restaurant which was kinda neat. We sat at the bar/kitchen for a while and got to see how the cooks make the food. Which was interesting and entertaining. The place has a 60s diners feel to it. They played Spanish music which I liked.
The service was friendly and helpful as well.
The food was served in big portions and was yummy and filling."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place whilst on our visit. Oddly enough it didn't appear on Yelp until we searched for it and realized why once we found it as it appeared as \"closed\". Food was very good. The only cheeky thing was a default 15% grat on their card processors for a self serve establishment. We ended up paying 48$ for a panini, a plate, a beer and  soda. That's a bit pricey for a casual self serve no frills lunch"}
{"text":"Easter weekend I was dog sitting in the area and I wanted to take advantage of being in a different neighbourhood. La Cubana had been on my bookmark list for a while and after reviewing the menu I was set on trying the short-rib plate. 

Wow, I was not disappointed! In fact, I went back the next day and shamelessly got the exact same thing. I got the short-rib plate to go, subbed the rice and beans for extra purple cabbage slaw, and the fried plantains. I will note the plantain was done differently on both plates in regards to smashed on the second but not on the first, and it was a sweet ripe plantain the first plate and not the second. I love all plantains in any way so I don't care either way... drool. Anyway - service was very fast and friendly. The short-rib was delicious and everything you could want in a short-rib. They had crispy onions on top, which was a nice touch. I was really pleased that the meat wasn't submerged in the Guava BBQ sauce and it was enough to compliment the meat instead of over-power. The purple cabbage slaw was unexpectedly yummy and just the right amount of sweet. Everything is fairly well single-portioned and I can see how some would note the price. However, I do not feel that way. This is a delicious dish that I would never make at home and I am pleased to trade my money for it 

I will go back again and plan to dine in next time. It is a small diner-like space with some booths and some bar seats. I might branch out and try something else... but cannot make any promises."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian plate and my friend had the chicken. 
I enjoyed my food. The flavours were there! The plantains and the slaw were my favourite! 
My friend had the chicken. She told me she found a little dry. After I taste tested it, I found it moist. Mind you she ate all the meat off the bone. 
We were looking through Yelp Reviews and noticed a lot of recommendations for the Yuca Frita. They were good but I'm not a fan of too much deep fried stuff so the plantains were enough for me. 
We also order a guava drink. Delicious! Will definitely be coming back!   
The only reason I gave it four stars is because the avocado and tomato weren't really transformed. The owner and staff were nice and welcoming and the service was quick!"}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches - the chicken is cooked just right, the bun is light and flaky like a croissant... yummy! And cool retro decor. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a long time to check it out and see if its real Cuban cuisine, I finally had the opportunity to go with my boyfriend. My boyfriend is originally from Canada so he doesn't know what Cuban food is and I wanted him to try it, I'm originally from Miami FL and I grew up in a Cuban household where all I ate was Cuban food. When we got to the restaurant we only waited 5 minutes to be seated. We asked if we could sit outside because the weather was nice. They seated us in the back of the restaurant on the deck, it was very nice, I like the decor. Our waitress was very friendly and she answered all the questions that we had about the food. I told her jokingly that I was going to see if the food was really how Cubans make it because of my background, she told us got the owners were Cuban but not to cooks lol she was very honest. I ordered the media noche sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered the pressed Cubano sandwich.. We also ordered two side dishes one was the yuca frita, and the other was the stuffed tostones. The food didn't take very long, I don't know why reviewers here bitch so much about the service and how the waiters are rude and all this nonsense the experience was pretty good the food came out 10 minutes later, our waitress brought our entrees as well as our side dishes so it was perfect. Now here comes the disappointing part, as I said I was raised in a Cuban household my background is Cuban so I grew up eating nothing but Cuban food and I really know my shit when it comes to Cuban food, the media noche was nothing like the original Cuban medianoche... First of all the bread that they used was regular sandwich bread that it had ham and pork and Gruyere, the ham was similar to the one you buy in a Oscar Meyer package just like the pork, and the original Media noche does not contain Gruyere it contains Swiss cheese and the bread has to be Cuban bread and pressed so this was way off. The Cubano sandwich doesn't even exist lol but this one was pressed. The stuffed tostones were way off as well, instead of using the regular plantain they use the sweet kind, again way off. The yuca frita however was pretty authentic. Overall the food was good its not like if it was inedible or anything, just not real authentic Cuban cuisine, if the owners are Cuban they really need to polish up on their Cuban cuisine because nothing on the menu is authentic. Also it was pretty overpriced for what we got, for what we paid for, in Miami we would have had a banquet."}
{"text":"For some reason this is my favourite restaurant. It's clean, quick and perfectly tasty. Everything is homemade and deliciously seasoned. mellow"}
{"text":"Came here for an office party and had a great time, this is one of the only locations that has ample seating for a gathering above 20 people and our private area in the back was definitely up to snuff. The food here is great, from the yucca frita to the soups and yes even the sandwiches are all perfectly seasoned and delicious.

There is one gripe, that is that most of the cocktails are watered down quite a bit and the mojito was a bit disappointing. stick to the beers and you'll have a great time"}
{"text":"Pressed Cubano, you have to get it, it is Cuban's equivalent (but wayy better) to grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Saturday right when it opened -- not crowded. Walked into the door -- everything was beautiful. Ordered the Cuban breakfast -- incredible. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. My group also ordered the chorizo hash and steak and eggs, both of which were also so so great. The colors and decor of the restaurant are really pleasant and set me up for a great day."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Saturday night. I think the recently opened this location because the back is still messy and the washrooms are a deathtrap.

Foodwise, we were not dissapointed. We both had the Pressed Medianoches and it was delicious. Crispy bread, tasty pork, tangy mustard seeds and lil bit of pickles. 

The place was busy but not crazy, we found a table right away and within 45 mns had eaten and left.

The other plates looked great. Will def be back"}
{"text":"Very authentic Cuban. I have had about 5 different items to date, and they are in keeping with what you would get from a Havana restaurant, or on Calle Ocho in Miami. Filling, straightforward, and tasty. Decent value. Yucca frites & citrus topping well done. Beans&rice and breads are bangon as well."}
{"text":"Was with a group of five, out celebrating my new job (I paid sadly).  La Cubana treated us with a delicious medley of dishes from tangy sweet glazed fried squid to a very meat laden Cuban sandwich.  Ambience was comfy, service was casual and friendly; would come back again.
Some of my favourites were the cod croquets, nicely battered, tastefully done cod mash inside.  Pork belly had a nice exterior crisp skin followed by a melt in your mouth fat and ended with a moist tender morsel of meat - pig died with a cause.  Only thing I found could be up the ante was the guava fizz I had - I remember those guava candies tastes different..."}
{"text":"I happened to go for the first time on the first hot night in Toronto....I had the ribs, and the plantains - all Celiac friendly.  The waiter also warned of cross contamination possibility.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The brunch menu looks very good. I tried the chorizo empanada plate which was very tasty. Great food at this place. Coffee is delicious as well. Will come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I cant wait to go back. Great place to grab a bite. 
Two of us got the veggie plate and were very satisfied.
Between the 3 of us we shared Yuca fries and conch fritters....very good but as most people mentioned in the reviews I couldn't taste any seafood still delicious.
We were sitting at the bar as there wasn't enough dining seating. Thus allowed us to chat with one of the ladies working there. However once people left we relocated to proper seating for ease of talking between 3 people.
I can't wait to go back.
Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Good food and super friendly servers. Everything is very relaxed about this place. There is seating in the back for larger groups :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the decor is nice, and the  authentic Cuban music adds a nice touch.  But, like others said, the service wasn't bad... but it was not appealing a all.... doesn't make for the most pleasant dining experience, they either don't care, or try way too hard, however, service aside, The food wins here for sure though! 

The food, chicken dinner and pork shoulder dinner, were both awesome, perfectly cooked and bursting with flavors. We will definitely be back for the food!  The crispy corn fritter with some green spicy salsa were my favorite item. 

One example about the service... Being addressed by the scruffy waiter \"talk to me\" when he took our order just didn't feel quite right.  They seemed to speak in slang the entire time. This might seem cool or trendy to some, but its not my personal preference. They were nice enough and fairly efficient, a bit slow & nonchalant, but, hey, it's a diner!! 

Either way, La Cubana is definitely worthwhile to experience, for the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner on the back patio of La Cubana last night. We went for cod fritters and musssels to start followed by some grilled fish sandwich and grilled shrimp rice and beans and split the avocado salad. Simply exquisite meals and delicious fruit cocktails. The dessert was the coffee natilla and I don't think I've ever had such a perfect creme brulé. It was very much like tiramisu had a baby with creme brulé.  

Highly recommended restaurant. Very good service and wonderful atmosphere with great food."}
{"text":"Service: kind of slow and inattentive, but pleasant enough.  Food comes really fast though!

Food: Black bean soup was quite good - well seasoned with a nice amount of heat. 
Achiote chicken was boring and devoid of any interesting flavour.  
Pork shoulder was quite good - it was quite pork-y in flavour but the seasonings really worked well.
Rice and beans side: quite good
Red cabbage slaw: boring and fairly flavour-less.
House beer (black): good.
Key lime bar: not enough lime flavour.  Tastes too much of condensed milk.  Also way bigger than I expected.

The space:  it was too cold which made the whole experience less pleasant.  At least half the people in the restaurant were wearing coats.  Really not acceptable.

Overall - decent place.  I'd go back, though I won't rush back."}
{"text":"I've been to La Cubana a couple of times now and it's a pretty fantastic place! 

The overall 50s diner style is very charming, but I prefer sitting on their stellar patio. 

Although the corn is absolutely delicious, at $7 for a single cob cut is half it is a pretty big rip off. (I also noticed from the pictures of the menu posted here, that almost all their menu prices have gone up within the last year ... yikes!) 

Besides that, I have to say my vegetarian plate was absolutely delicious - SO much food! The highlights were the black bean burger and rice/beans. I definitely left stuffed after this meal. 

I've also previously tried the corn fritters and medianoche - both were great!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend last week to this quick diner style joint. When we came in, we were seated immediately. Since it was our first time, the 
waitress is very kind and explained the menu thoroughly. 

Cuban food is kinda spicy haha. We decided to share 2 items as recommended by the waitress. We ordered the guava bbq beef short ribs. It came with slaw, rice, beans, and tostones for $15 and we also had the black bean soup ($6). We couldn't really taste the guava flavour but the shortribs were very tender. If you can't handle spice, be careful as there are peppers hiding in the slaw. Soup is not bad either; the white sauce in soup is a little spicy. 

Dinner is ok... Heard this place is better for breakfast so maybe I'll come back then!"}
{"text":"Saw this placed mentioned in the magazine on the train on my way in from the airport. Glad I came. Very tasty food. The cod croquetas were delicious and not over fried. The pork dish was tender and seasoned nicely along with the rice and tostones. Topped it off with Cuban coffee natilla which was not too sweet. Overall a great find!"}
{"text":"Came in to escape the cold November weather, hoping to be transported to the sunny shores of Cuba.

We ordered a few small tapas - cod fritters, coconut shrimp and bean/cheese empanadas (all $6-$7) each.  We also got the fish sandwich ($8) to share.  Drinks - pint of the Junction brew ($7) and Periodista ($10).

Tapas were devoured as quickly as they were delivered.  Portions a bit on the small side and in random numbers, ie: 4 shrimp, 3 empanadas, and 3 fritters.  Sandwich was okay, a bit cold and didn't come with sides.

Love the seafoamy green decor and bright floor tiles.  I could be tempted back for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! If you're looking for legitimate Cuban food, go here! The menu was smaller yet diverse and offered plenty of options for both sandwiches and dinner plates. The drinks were perfectly concocted and the atmosphere was great for friends and/or a date. Our server (forgive me....Heather or Hannah?) was so sweet and offered us a lot of help with recommendations. I would be back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I stopped by La Cubana, because I had it bookmarked in Yelp and I really wanted to try their food. The place didn't disappoint. The chicken sandwich with avocado was superb. Roasted chicken was equally good, but a little dry IMHO. Their coffee with milk (cafe con leche) was way better than Starbucks' latte. Next time, I'll be trying their brunch menu when I'm in the area. Oh yeah, the decor is reminiscent of the 60s. + they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"Good vibes, wouldn't suggest anything here except for their pressed sandwich and their fish sandwich. All the apps I've had there including shrimp and the calamari is not worth it. Their bbq short rib plate is okay, their rice and beans are tasty though....somewhere I would go for a quick bite, stick to their sandwiches! Oh and their service is great but is takes a while for the food to come!"}
{"text":"Great space, great service and awesome food! My husband and I ordered our drinks of cafe cubano and guava fizz. The coffee or espresso was good according to my husband, and we both loved the tangy carbonated guava fizz.

We ordered the pressed cubano and conch fritters to share. The pressed cubano was nicely pressed with perfect amount of meat and cheese, and nice bite of chopped pickles. The conch fritters had crispy exteriors and pillowy interiors. They said it's made out of fish and dough with chopped onions and sweet peppers. It was delicious. 

Overall, we're both happy to have a restaurant that serves delicious Cuban food in the hood! It's so good, that we've already planned out what to order next time. Short ribs plate and yuca frites here we come!!"}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING dinner here last night. We went for my girlfriend's birthday and the staff went over and above to make it a great night. The service was excellent, the food was delicious and we had a fantastic night. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"4 of us went to La Cubana for a Sunday brunch.  We arrived just before opening so it was easy to get a table (although there was a sizeable lineup at the door when we left at around 11:30).  It's a beautifully designed space (upscale-retro-Latin-diner-chic, I suppose) and service was friendly and attentive.  We had the chorizo hash, the steak n' eggs, and the baked eggs.  Everyone was very happy with their meals and the sides that came with each were fantastic (fried plantain, especially).  The baked eggs were a little over-cooked but delicious nonetheless.  The food was a little long in coming (understandable, given that we were part of the first wave of customers that ordered all at once) but we were kept occupied with free refills of more than decent drip coffee.  We would definitely return for brunch and the dinner menu looks great too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"La Cubana on Ossington is a nice spot to grab a Cuban style meal. There's a relaxed, diner appeal to this place that feels welcoming. You can also grab a beer with your order which is great. 

Must-try items: 
Chicken Medianoche 
Tostones

I haven't been to Cuba yet, so I can't say whether it's authentic or not. But I imagine it's not too far off. Either way, it's not too pricey and the food is great for my tastes."}
{"text":"New location for an old favourite. Sadly the menu no longer has our beloved Habanero squid but I double checked and all the locations have the same updated menu.

Arrived for dinner on a Monday night. Called to make reservations an hour before and didn't need to wait. The place was packed. You can sit at the bar up a few stairs or table at the main floor. Unfortunately, it was not wheelchair accessible.

I ordered the Guava bbq short ribs and it was good, but when I tried the pork belly, the pork belly was the definite winner. It was super flavourful and tender with a nice glaze on it. Both main dishes came with sides (red cabbage and tostanes). 

Ordered the buttermilk donuts that came out hot and fresh. There were 6 of them with some whipped cream with caramel sauce on the side. Absolutely delicious! So soft and not at all dry and not super sweet. The main dish was so filling I almost didn't have room to have the dessert.

Service was very quick and we were in and out within 45 minutes. Prices are excellent for the quality and amount of food."}
{"text":"Really like the cubanos sandwiches. Excellent taste. Side salads were a little plain but didn't really care that much. Excellent coffee. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"First I love the other location, and have been to this location twice with the second visit worse than the first.   We waited 45 minutes for a simple 5 min appetizer. And almost an hour for our sandwiches.  There were other tables served before us that arrived 20 min after us.  The waitress didn't seem genuinely concerned and walked away when I asked why it was taking so long  My daughters sandwhich would have been less greasy if deep fried.  In the other location it was perfect.  Sad to say but this restaurant is not managed properly and the other on ossingron is far far ahead in every aspect."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious! Servers are good and the atmosphere is cute with a 1950s cafe vibe. A little chilly if you sit by the door in the wintertime.

The yuca frites are amazing and the Chicken sandwich is really good if you don't eat pork. Also serve beer which washes down a sandwich nicely!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why this restaurant is constantly packed and busy. I am literally waiting for the next opportunity I can eat at this place again.
The menu is short as they specialize and have perfected those few cuban staples. 
Apparently their other location has a few more options, but regardless, the food here was exceptional.
Considering the rush, the servers were very friendly and we luckily got a table immediately. Yes, the tables are cramped together, but the whole decor and style was pretty charming.
The table mats were the menu, and I decided to go for the roasted Achiote chicken that comes with rice and beans (my favourite thing ever!), tostones (fried plantains) and this amazing pickled coleslaw. While deciding what to order I already planned that I'll have to come back and have the authentic cuban sandwich with a side of their bean soup during the cold weather as that sounded extremely comforting.
The food arrived within literally 3 minutes and the plate was piled high! I cannot explain how amazing my meal was. The chicken was so tender, the rice w/ beans was full of flavour and those tostones are just indescribable. The price was average but worth every crumb on my plate, which I almost licked clean!
Best part of this restaurant was that it's located exactly opposite to Bang Bang ice cream! 
A definite must-go eatery in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was seriously surprised at how much this restaurant can vary compared to its other location in Ossington! I completely fell in love with La Cubana when I tried it at the Ossington location, and when I found out that they have another restaurant that's a bit closer I was anxious to go as soon as possible. La Cubana in Ossington had amazing service, the food arrived pretty quickly despite the crowd and the servings were gigantic.
However, at this location the servers didn't seen so keen, since it took some time to actually get any service. The food also took a good 25 minutes (or more) to arrive. I was excited that this location served grilled fish, which the other locations didn't, but when it arrived I was speechless. It looked like it was meant to be an appetizer rather than a main, along with the side of rice w/beans which must have been like 1/2 a cup. My brother ordered what he got at the last location (the vegetarian option), which was also half the size. The mains come with fried tostones, that, based on our last experience, were crispy, fresh and pretty big. However, this time what came were some small, limp and soggy tostones (what barely seemed like). I finished my meal in less than 1 minute, since I was starving and it was just so small, so I had no choice but to order another side of beans and rice. This place is pretty pricey for a non-upscale restaurant.

For whoever wants to try amazing Cuban food in Toronto, head to La Cubana in Ossington and save your time and money by avoiding this particular one."}
{"text":"Love it! Bf and I got fried squid to start and it was fresh and everything squid should be.

The restaurant has a local brewery make a special beer to pair with their food and we both had (a few) pints. Didn't disappoint.

I ordered the fish sandwich and bf got the fish dinner. The fish was totally delicious, soft and fresh for both of us; mine came on a dense yummy bun that was perfectly sturdy to contain the large portion of fish. 

We finished off the meal with the little donuts which were freshly made and a great way to end the experience. 

We had great service from the bartender who was also our server. As other reviews mentioned it was busy but I thought staff handled it well. Not sure if the earlier reviews should be chalked up to the hiccups that ordinarily accompany a new restaurant but we had an awesome experience. I'm already recommending the heck out of it to friends!"}
{"text":"The staff was very genuine and passionate, something I don't encounter too often at most restaurants, and the food was outstanding. There was a short wait to get a seat but it was well well worth it. 

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Low key vibe with paper menus and old decor on the walls. It almost felt Cuban, excerpt it was -10 degrees outside! I ordered the Cuban sandwich and my friend ordered the grilled fish sandwich. Both were very good. I also liked the avocado salad (nice dressing). Only complaint is that the sandwiches don't come with fries, which is unusual. We got the tostones, which were supposed to be fried plantains, but were mostly just fried dough."}
{"text":"The roasted chicken plate is highly recommended ! Along with beef rib plate and pork belly and pork shoulder. Their meat is very well prepared and tender! Their portion size is very fair for their price. The interior design has a strong sense of culture to it."}
{"text":"The black bean soup, puree style, was delicous good flavor and the right amount of spice. I had the short rib sandwich which was very flavorful including the tasty egg bun. My friend had the chicken thighs sandwich which was a cold style sandwich and a little bit boring for me but he really liked it.  I will come again."}
{"text":"Food and drink: The mojito was definitely on point! Lots of mint, not too sweet and a strong pour - just how I like it! I had the vegetarian sandwich which was surprisingly good - fresh ingredients and bun.

Service: Relatively quick which was nice. The tables are pretty close together and the place has a finer feel so definitely very casual"}
{"text":"Great fresh I believe authentic .. I had the Pineapple salsa with grilled fish as a main . The tilapia fish just melted in my mouth .. the Coconut  grilled shrimp was very fresh and tingling with spices .. definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I'd rate this place 3.5 or 3.75  stars . The food had great flavor and served in a timely / efficient manner.I would definitely go back again. Although service was pleasant it didn't wow me. When I go to a restaurant not only are you paying for food but also the experience. If I want to sub fried yuca instead of tostones don't say no just say sure it's an additional $ .  I didn't need to order a whole order to myself just to have it with my meal. Sometimes it's the small things that make A big difference in the overall dining experience."}
{"text":"What to try? 

Their pressed Cubano. Of course if it's your first time here, you have to try their classic cubano sandwich. Then you can work your way into the other dishes too. The cubano came out freshly grilled and therefore had the crunch I was looking for. The gruyere was melted to the way I liked it with the right amount of ham in between two rye bread slices. I would try the yuca fries next time and their main platters. The price is reasonable for the portion sizes you get and I love the atmosphere in the restaurant. It's cozy and reminds me of a 80s diner with the old school signs up and the retro tiles. I also enjoyed the Cuban music they played in the background. From modern world outside, you step into a restaurant that can offer you a retro atmosphere. Pretty cool!

Last tip?

Don't be disappointed to find the restaurant small because there's more spots in the back and you got to try the beer here too. Cuban beer but brewed locally! Pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Early lunch before leaving TO.  Affordable price and good size sandwiches. We had traditional, chicken and short rib. All were very flavorful. The cabbage slaw is a good side to share; wasn't a big fan of trontones."}
{"text":"Some of my favourite grilled shrimp in the city. I get the plate every time we go to dinner here. The mashed plantain chips are dry but whatever, the rest of the plate makes up for it. I get the shrimp EVERY TIME which says a lot because I normally jump around the menu a lot. 
The coconut shrimp as an app is so delicious as well. 

The service generally is pretty good here. The resto itself is so cute, great little bar and patio. The prices are reasonable. One of my fave spots to hit up on Ronces."}
{"text":"Great food!  Cubano sandwich filled me right up, and the plantains were on point.  Chips and salsa were delicious, roasted corn and corn frituras were great starters.  Cocktails were tasty as well!  Staff were friendly, and the covered seat on the back patio was fantastic.  Love the retro feel of the place as well and hope that I might be seated inside next time!  Meal ended up being about $50 a person with lots of small plates and 2-3 drinks per person."}
{"text":"Pressed Cubano sandwich, yuca frites and a raspberry lime rickey with an amazingly good coffee in an unassuming little spot. Got lucky and was served my meal... yay!

Nothing fancy, just a solid meal. Coming back soon for some black bean soup."}
{"text":"Bear in mind that there isn't exactly an authentic Cuban cuisine. 
The place itself looks good and one feels like in a movie. The food options is very limited and meat-free dishes do not abound. 
The roasted shrimp ($15) I had was not fresh at all but it came with OK rice and beans, fried plantains (2 big pieces) and coleslaw-- nothing fancy nor hard to do right. Still, everything was pretty plain. 

You can get much more quality and flavor  for $15 anywhere else. 


The waiting time to get our orders taken was unnecessarily long. Finally, for some mysterious reason we could not get separate checks. 
 
La Cubana should hire more staff, branch out on dishes and flavors and definitely expand their bar, as it would be a great addition/complement/source of clientele for this restaurant. 

To sum up, satisfied but never again."}
{"text":"Firs time at a cuban place and I've been blown away. The bf and I came here before going to high park and we really enjoyed the cute retro vibes here. We ordered the chicken platter and the fish burger and both were phenomenal. The looks on our faces after we took our first bites said it all -- it was great. The fish was perfectly cooked, paired with avocado and the pineapple, made the sandwich so good. His chicken platter was also really flavorful and we could still see the steam and juices coming out of it as he attempted to cut it. It seemed to be a really popular place and other tables were ordering different things that I'd love to come back and try more stuff. 
The waitress was super nice and happy to explain/answer any questions we had since we didn't really know much of the menu."}
{"text":"Way better than the food you eat in vacation resorts in Cuba. These hotels put a bad reputation on Cuban food.

La Cubana has a wonderful selection of Cuban classics at very affordable price. The portions are pretty big too. This particular Ossington location is also an Instagram heaven for all you \"Likes\" addicts out there. 

Briefly: food is amazing, affordable, A+ service, and cool design."}
{"text":"tldr: Quite authentic Cuban food with a bit of flare. Good drinks. Sandwiches are a bit pricey. Plates are good value and high quality.

This cuban restaurant is a nice find for the area. The guava juice among others are tasty. The chicken plate is top notch. The chicken just falls off the bone and the spice is authentic. The bean rice and cabbage are solid complements. The sandwiches are a bit overhyped and not good value. but still taste good. Cool vibe and decor. Backroom bar is nifty. Staff is friendly. Nearby a lot of other cool shops and cafes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, moderate food pricing, and a cafe ambiance combined for an overall good experience at La Cubana.   The pork shoulder was moist and tender, the beans and rice were flavorful, the red cabbage provided a fresh tangy contrast and the yuca frites were nice and crispy.  Finally, the doughnuts were a terrific finish to our meal.   My only criticism is that drinks seemed a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Got their short rib with guava sauce, cooked to tender perfection, really like the guava sauce, it was sweet but not overly sweet to overtake the other flavors, the slaw provided a great tangy contrast to the sweet short ribs! Everything was at a great balance, every side complimented each other. The Yuka fries were also great, very unique starchy texture, a great change from our conventional fries. If you want what I assumed was authentic Cuban food, you gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"The front of the restaurant had a bright, colourful, & vintage feel, whereas we were seated at the very back of the restaurant which transformed into a dark starry night vibe.

I tried their Pork Belly and their Guava Short Rib Cuban plates. Both dishes were served with refreshing coleslaw that had slices of HOT jalapeño peppers, tostones (fried plantain patties), and warm beans & rice. The pork belly was so juicy and melt in your mouth. The Short ribs were also extremely tender and succulent with the marinade sauce, although I can't say I taste any guava flavours.
 
This was my first time trying Cuban food, and I'm already in love with how delicious they make their pork!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Place was busy. We ordered the pork belly and beef shoulder dish. Size portions were great, definitely a great bang for your buck. Food took a while to come out, over 30min. Great selection if sugar cane sodas."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, reasonable prices, good service, cool decor, interesting cocktails, and authentic Cuban cuisine.

If I weren't somewhat indifferent to Cuban cuisine, Cubana would get 5 stars.

I might be back regularly for the amazing coffee and (seen but not yet tried) deserts, but otherwise only the hardy cubano sandwich would bring me back again - although we tried the cod croquetas (ok, a bit potatoey), the habanero-glazed squid (more sweet than spice), and a side of slaw (dead bland - truly Cuban).

edited to add: Remember to ask for their mango hot sauce - it makes the place worth a visit all by itself. They should bottle it for sale at the counter."}
{"text":"Cuba....if you can't fly there, then go visit La Cubana at the west end for some good food instead.
Just like the way i see Cuba in my mind,  La Cubana is set in an old world ambience - the tiles, the marbled tables, the little old-styled coca-cola bottles.  They just need to bring in a classic car to complete the theme.
I keep hearing how Cuban food doesn't taste good.  So i was curious and nervous about seeing if this bad rep is true.  Well i don't know about the rest of the Cuban food, but the slow cooked ribs plate that i ordered was outstanding and flavorful!!  The meat was tender with amazing sauce coated throughout.  The purple slaw was delicious.  And the rice with black beans was awesome with a bite of spiciness.  I am definitely going back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"The environment was forgettable (goal was-old school Havana diner. Actuality-hospice with renovation plans accumulating dust) and then there was the waitress that was borderline despondent 
BUT 
the guava bbq short rib...JESÚS. When I say tender, it was like, let me drop to the floor and sing otis' try a little tenderness TENDER (it should be noted that this would be logistically impossible because the tables are so close together, salamanders couldn't squeeze between) and for that La Cubana receives 4 stars. Nothing else is worth mentioning. However, in the words (and vocal quality) of metallica's james hetfield, nothing else matters."}
{"text":"Welcome to my hood, La Cubana. I'm sorry I ignored you at first. I was just worried you were a little overpriced and once upon a time I was underwhelmed by your sister on Roncy. I will sing your praises sharp and loud from here on out...

Cuban sandwiches, plates, sides, fizzes and cocktails are being pumped out speedily at this beautiful little restaurant. Get your order, grab a seat and get comfy. I had La Cubana on a soft bun and a raspberry lime fizz. I will be getting all hangover sodas from La Cubana from now on, so refreshing! A meal for two (sans booze) came to $30, and given the glory of the meal, that ain't bad.

Beware: Adorable seafoam green and red touches everywhere will make you rethink everything about your own kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife really enjoyed the tasty foods, had the pork shoulder & the achiote roasted chicken dinner plates complimented with a pressed Cubano everything was spot on, not to mention the dessert, we will revisit and we recommend to anyone looking for some soul in their food."}
{"text":"Very welcomed addition to the east side. Loved la cubana on ossington and now that we've moved to the east, I was happy to see it here. Similar menu and concept. Not too busy, so you can always get a spot and personal attention."}
{"text":"With our American cell service not working, we were allured into La Cubana. We were hungry and the vintage diner feel and good lighting encouraged us to give it a try. Sadly, we were disappointed. In order to pull of the vintage diner feel, you have to keep it classy and the cheesy menus and the t-shirts the staff were wearing, shows it wouldn't be a quality experience. We found the service a little slow and my cubano was nothing special. If you don't have other options, go here, but if you do, try another nearby top rated restaurant."}
{"text":"La Cubana has a very nice environment and seating areas, the staff is friendly and quick to take orders/check on how you're enjoying the meal. I ordered the chicken medianoche, French fries, and a mango colada. I found the sandwich to be on the drier side, but overall the meal was okay."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Thursday night. It started to get pretty full around 8 o'clock. The main complaint I have of this place was that the tables were placed very very close together. Unless you are a size 0, it would be next to impossible to slide through the tables to sit on the booth side of the table.

We ordered two cocktails, the sangria and the mojito. Both drinks seemed a bit watery. For our meals we ordered the Yuca Fries, the Guava Short Rib Plate and the Pressed Cubano. The Yuca Fries were very good. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and it was drizzled with a very tasty sauce.  The Guava Short Rib was tender and soft and very flavourful. And the Pressed Cubano was a delicious panini style sandwich which I enjoyed quite a bit. All in all, the food was quite good. And I would give this place 3.5 if they would let me give half scores. The only reason I wouldn't give it more than that is because it did feel at times that we were way too close to other people and the service although very friendly, was quite slow at times. Food came out very quick but just to get our order in took quite a while. I also saw our waitress sneeze and wipe her nose with her bare hand and then pick up two plates to deliver to another table which honestly would make the best meal seem not that great anymore. 

Other than that, decent place to come for a quick bite and cheap eats. They also have a back space that's available for groups and parties."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this colourful Ossington joint. Had great service from the cashier to end up settling on the guava braised short rib. Meat was super tender falling off the bone, on a flavourful bed of rice and served with plantains and slaw.

Great spot if you're looking for a quality but casual meal and don't have a lot of time. Food came up within 4-5 minutes and was super tasty. Looking forward to trying a sandwich next visit."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! The staff are friendly and always helpful to explain all the dishes. The food is delicious. 

If you are going in the summer, I would recommend to sit on their patio area."}
