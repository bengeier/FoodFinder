{"text":"I came with my best friend. The staff was extremely friendly&  helpful I told the cashier it was my first time coming to dine with them and he let me know which was the most popular item etc... food was so good! I'm addicted Ahah. I got the big bento box, chicken and shrimp with fried rice and veggies. Definitely a place I'm going to visit more often!"}
{"text":"I love VOLCANO GRILLE so much. Very friendly staff been seeing them since they were at the warmsprings location. I always order the Bento Box, all steak; all rice. Super duper delicious, steak is so juicy and tender and omg the BOMB! I also love their new location, much more closer to me haha, i come almost 3 times a week! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS place! Thank you Volcano Grille for always satisfying my rice and steak cravings! Onelove and see you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Oh my GOSH so yummy I can't eat it fast enough! Brown rice bowl w grilled chix & veggies doused in their house-made \"magma\" and the \"fuji-yummy\" sauces (self-serve house-made sauces, there's a dozen or so choices). My friend had a Bento Box - Angus beef, potstickers (aka 'gyoza') dipped in Ponzu sauce, and salad with ridiculously good Asian house dressing. The owners are working the grill, such sincerely nice guys. Great servvce, super fast - it's like Benihana fast-food! I loves me Volcano Grill!!!!! 5 stars! Do yourself a favor and get there, holy cow."}
{"text":"Best Bento Box in Vegas!!! I come to Vegas just to eat here! My favorite is the chicken and beef bento box with yakisoba noodles and dumplings! YUM!!! And the yum-yum sauce is exactly that....yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing their steaks are juicy and the service is great and the cooks are always nice to me that's why my students and I love coming back! If your going to go to a restaurant go to this one! Ken and Fitz (Owners) really know their stuff when it comes to Japanese food. The place is always clean and neat, its well designed and the food is even BETTER! You be stupid not to ever try this place!    Go now and try it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful hidden little gem! This place is fantastic and reasonably priced! A must go!"}
{"text":"I come and eat here a lot.  Not to many places around where I live to get some high quality cheap steak.  Plus I love there sauce bar its to die for.    The staff is awesome there, they are so friendly and know almost all the regulars by names which gives it the small town feel.  If you want a fast food benny hannah then you have found the place."}
{"text":"Food is really good and guys in the back are great! The cashier was not very friendly she needs to work on not arguing back with customer when their order is made wrong..other than that will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I trusted the yelp reviews and glad I did. So good. Upgrade the meat and get the angus beef and the spicy garlic chicken. Both so tender."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Good place to go on your lunch break for fast service and great food."}
{"text":"I have got to say that Volcano Grille is seriously one of my favorite places to eat. The first time my husband and I tried it we were shocked at how incredibly tasty the food was. We go every week and they never disappoint. The cashiers are always friendly.  The steak is always choice meat. We get the bento box which is your choice of 4 items and is a great price for the amount of food they give you. Eveything we have ever tasted on the menu has always satisfied us. Oh and they have a sauce bar with some genius sauces. My favorite is the sweet garlic. YUUUMMMM. If youve never tried Volcano Grille I would definitly recommend giving them a shot. Tried sams, tried madness....mehhhh....Volcano Grille is by far the best!"}
{"text":"We ordered the lunch special with brown rice and it was fantastic!!! The food came out in good timing!!!"}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to try a new venue so I hopped onto Yelp and found Volcano Grille. It received good reviews and I was very curious to try out their different sauces since I so consider myself a dipping freak (I'm the girl who prefers sweet and sour sauce over ketchup for her French fries).  Volcano Grille is nestled in what looks like an empty shopping center. There were some seats in the front and more seating toward the right side of the restaurant. What really caught my eye was table set up for the different sauces. You could get as much as you wanted of any kind. It definitely saved me the embarrassment of asking for one of each. After looking at the menu, I liked that they offered hearty and/or healthy choices They had side dishes of brown rice, white rice, grilled veggies, and gyoza. The proteins ranged from steak (filet mignon, mmmm!)  to salmon. Feeling like a light lunch, I ended up ordering the box lunch of salmon with brown rice and veggies. Before I sat down with my meal I grabbed 3 different sauces: teriyaki, sweet garlic teriyaki and their very own yum yum sauce. The salmon was cooked nicely, seared with garlic. I found myself dipping my salmon and veggies in the sauces. The yellow yum yum sauce was pretty good,  tangy with a nice hint of creaminess. The sweet garlic teriyaki was my favorite with the salmon. The seared garlic salmon with the garlic in the teriyaki was garlic overload but in a wonderfully delicious way. I ended up going back to the \"Sauce Center\" to get two more cups. Quite tasty! I feel like this place could be a diamond in the rough. It's not fine dining but definitely a great place for a quick bite if you're not in the mood for greasy, junky fast food. They've got something for the healthy and for those who want to splurge a little (I might just have to try to steak next time). The staff is friendly and overall I had a good experience. You'll definitely catch me over there again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I have eaten here several times since moving here and the prices, selection, and quality are top notch.  It is off the beaten path but well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vento box that everyone was so crazy about  and that was the most horrible food ever tasted  i even spend a day at  my hotelroom  since i got food poison for all of you out there make worth your money for the price i paid i would have gone to eat at panda express at least i know that they are not pretended  to call themselves something they are not  like volcano advertise false statements like  they say they sell teppanyaki food these people  need urgently take some classes before call themselves teppenyaki chefs they do not know that is that at all"}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS ON POINT. The steak is always the best! Like fluffy little meat pillows. The yakisoba is expertly cooked. It's delicious and so flavorful but not salty. The selection of sauces is amazing. My fave is mixing Spicy Teriyaki and Hot Lava. I have been eating Volcano since they were at the old location on Tenaya and Warm Springs and will continue to keep coming!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Had a quick meal while visiting people in the nearby hospital. Enjoyed all the sauces."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great atmosphere, nice people and don't forget the Yum Yum sauce."}
{"text":"I'm tough on restaurants because the market is so competitive, especially for my lunch dollars.   I love the easy-to-read menu. It makes for simple and fast ordering. Got the bento box with chicken and wild caught salmon (I won't eat farm raised), which was a treat.  It was actually too much food and I left half of the rice.  The proteins were perfectly prepared. The brown rice was a little more wet than I prefer, but they just opened for the day and probably don't want the rice to dry out.  Also got the spring rolls, which were wrapped like an egg roll. It was a little mushy inside, but tasty.   Will try the veggies and grilled Japanese rice next time.   Also tried 3 sauces, hot lava (amazing and lived up to the name), hot mustard (not mustardy enough), and ponzu sauce (not enough vinegar).  But really really happy overall and I will be back.  Also it was clean and liked the staff."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a meal other than the usual burgers, pizza and self proclaimed \"gourmet chinese\" restaurants that are plastered throughout the valley this is the place to eat.  They use only the best cuts of meat and seafood available. The accompanying sauces are made in house and pair perfectly with whatever you choose on the menu.  The staff is very personable, friendly and will remember you the next time you come in to eat... My family feels like it's a place we have known forever..."}
{"text":"Japanese teppanyaki at a ridiculously low price!  When I visited the website and saw \"Nothing over $10\" next to \"Filet, Shrimp, and Salmon,\" I had my doubts.  I paid $7.51 (with tax) for a chicken breast plate that included my choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein, and any number of veggies on a second list.  Volcano Grille has a number of sauces to entertain, from the eponymous \"Hot Lava\" and \"Hot Magma\" to the flavorful \"Japanese Salsa\" and appeasing \"Spicy Teriyaki.\"    Volcano Grille is a great buy.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is always good!  Fast, cheap, and quick service.  Steak is tender and juicy.  Nice selection of sauces.  Get the bento box it comes with 2 sides.  Way better than waiting for food at those hibachi places because you don't have to sit there and drooling over the food while wait for it to be cooked.  Quality food."}
{"text":"Love this place I can't get enough. Spicy katsu, noodles and rice. Hands down best place to go to on the Southwest side of town."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! AFFORDABLE! AMAZING SERVICE! EXCELLENT TASTE! This place has everything going for it- Ken is super nice and always remembers me when I come in. Their food is always amazing. The dipping sauces are also equally delicious as the steak, chicken, and shrimp! ALWAYS have a perfect dining in experience here :)"}
{"text":"Volcano Grille rocks! They are the best teppanyaki style Japanese cooking I have ever tasted. It's fresh and cooked to the customers satisfaction. The Bento Box is just the right amount of food for a big eater and their \"Bowl\" is served up just right for my appetite. Also, don't forget the \"Lava Bar\" dipping sauces - Hot Lava, Yum Yum, Ginger, Teriyaki, Spicy Teriyaki, Hot Magma, Sweet Garlic, Hot Mustard, Japanese Salsa (my favorite) and Miso Sesame! Can you believe they even have dessert Mochi ice cream. We travel from South Orange County so when we are Las Vegas we plan to always stop in at Volcano Grille. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. This is great for a night out or a quick bite between appointments. You are guaranteed to be greeted with a smile and served quality food every time."}
{"text":"Disappointed, ripped off, disbelief... I'm not sure how to describe my first visit here. I paid $16.21 for the large bento box. The lady behind the register said it came with plenty of proteins and veggies. First off, it doesn't come with veggies. Worse than that, the portions are so tiny that I was absolutely shocked by their stinginess. I'm talking 5 pieces of shrimp and fewer than 10 chunks of beef. To top it off, their noodles are a complete failure. They are worse than Panda Express noodles. I was lied to by their employee and fell completely ripped off by their kid size portions. My advice, seek another establishment unless you like overpaying, still being hungry, and appreciate being lied to."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Who likes this crap? Fast food may work as a concept for Chinese-American, but not for Japanese. Everything's from the freezer or prepared the night (or week) before. Dark, loud music. Who ever heard of a plastic bento box? An insult to Japanese cuisine. Cheap though, if that's what's important. Pleasant service."}
{"text":"I shop at the Firearms dealer down the way from this location so stopping here over the breakfast place seemed the better option.  A little dark on the interior atmosphere at first glance but once your eyes settle from the Vegas sun it's actually very comforting and relaxing.    You're hit with a fresh grilled meat flavor as soon as you walk in the door that get your tastebuds going crazy and ready to eat.  Prices are reasonable for the plate they give and for being a fairly simple menu it hits the nail on the head.  Protein options include Grilled Chicken, Angus Beef, and even Tofu and other options but just a few for reference. Personally I stayed with the Chicken. That paired with brown rice and grilled vegetables was a perfect light lunch.  When I say light I mean each ingredient in a different portion, my only gripe being the amount of rice they offer, far too much but still the bowl and portion size was well worth the price.  If you're in this area for any reason and decide against sandwiches, burgers, or eggs I HIGHLY suggest giving these guys a shot.  We will be back and I thank the service for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Owners are super nice. Been going there since they were at there old locations on Buffalo and food is always consistent."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Japanese Teppanyaki Restaurants in Las Vegas. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and all the sauces one could ask for."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a place I have eaten on the east coast. If you like hibachi style food and fast this is the place to go. Prices are fair and food is good."}
{"text":"It used to be a very affordable and delicious place to eat because they used to offer chicken bowls for $5.94 and generous portion. But now since the price for every item on menu drastically went up and significantly reduced the portion size ($1.50 may not sound a lot but it is when you get only a few pieces of steak and chicken for $13), I would everyone to get a chicken bowl (it is $7.02 now with tax included). It is the most bang for buck because you get less than 10 pieces of steak when you order steak bento for $13.00. Simply over priced. Also they don't use fillet mignon anymore. Its just a chewy meat(mystery meat). I've been coming here for more than 2 years. Take my words."}
{"text":"Volcano Grille is one of my favorite spots to eat! Their food is high quality, fresh, and simply delicious. Both chefs are amazing at what they do and we ALWAYS enjoy what we get!! From the steak to the chicken to the shrimp, anything you order always ends up being so yummy! They have an excellent array of sauces for dipping and a wide variety of sides. It is an easy location to find and get to and it's definitely affordable!! Volcano Grille is absolutely amazing and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!!! Excellent customer service, excellent food, and an excellent environment."}

{"text":"My fiancé and I have been going to volcano grille for 4 years, before they were at the current location. I realized I have never left a review.         We absolutely looooove this place. The food is so fresh and cooked consistently the same way every time. The portions are large for the amount you pay. We always get the steak and chicken plate with fried rice and veggies and it's amazing. They have a wonderful condiments bar. The staff and owners are incredible. Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING.  The place is usually empty, but I think it's gotta be due to the location, because it's really some of the best Japanese style food I've had. The steak is super juicy, shrimp is great, the noodles are amazing, everything is seasoned extremely well (not overkill though, just tasty), and they have a variety of interesting and tasty sauces.  I live in Henderson, but after a friend introduced me to Volcano, I make it a point to head over, if I am even remotely in that part of town.  It seems to be made to order, so depending on how many orders they have going, it can take a bit. It's worth it, IMO. Might considering calling in an order once you've been a few times and know the menu."}
{"text":"I was a regular here for a while, despite the way smaller portions for the price. This review pertains to an incident besides dining at the restaurant.  Yeah, sure it was my fault for (possibly leaving it). I called the place to ask if I left an ID there and the employee was on it and said sure i'll check. Minutes go by and she's like \"what can I get for you?\" And I just repeated myself, wondering what's been happening the whole time I'm on hold. She said \"can you just call back later we're kinda busy right now.\" They just opened, but fine if you are busy right now, don't tell me \"sure i'll check\" and come back to me with \"what can I get for you?\" YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT IN THE BEGINNING, so no time is wasted. She didn't even bother lying, you could have said YES or NO, regardless if you really checked or not and that would have been a better answer than being CLUELESS.  The only reason why I didn't bother is because I have already requested a new one, but would like to know where the one I lost was. I have worked in a restaurant and people leave ID's, it's nothing new..."}
{"text":"Great chow and always greeted by the staff!!! They definitely know how to make great hibachi without the high end prices.  Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here! I got a regular sized bento box with chicken, brown rice, grilled veggies, and no fountain drink (just a water cup). It came out to $9.18. My meal was okay, was hoping for just a tad bit bigger portion size for the chicken and rice. I really loved the sauce bar and also the atmosphere."}
{"text":"first time in this place today. I thought it's a little bit pricey but the food is really good and tasty. I will come here again to try their other entree."}
{"text":"Great bent box style. The filet mignon is my favorite, tender, juicy,and flavorful. I also like including shrimp on mine with fried rice and gyoza. Good option for a real meal fast that is not fast food. I just want more rice..lol"}
{"text":"I discovered this place by accident.  I wasn't sure what it was by name , so I checked it out.  The food was real good and tasty.  They have some great sauces.  I am looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"We picked this place as a pit stop before the airport. We needed something that would be quick, filling and in the southwest area. We made a great choice! My husband and I both ordered a bento box, mine with shrimp and tofu, his with steak and salmon. We were not disappointed. The food is cooked \"hibachi\" style and served in a bento box. They also have a small selection of dips to compliment your protein choices. The service was fast and friendly. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I love volcano grille from the fresh vegetables, grilled rice and yummy sauces it has become my favorite go to resturant! I do wish they had tea though. Service, food, decor all great!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place based on the reviews, but probably won't go out of my way to try again.  It was kinda neat to enter through an automatic sliding door. When I entered, the place was empty, but not a big deal. I approached the counter and there were several employees at the front, but none of them greeted me or seemed to care that there was a customer there.  But I decided to order a bowl with Angus beef. Specified that I wanted it 'to go'.  While I waited for my food, I perused the sauce bar and ladled a few of them to try.  Then I sat down and waited for my order. One of the employees brought me my order but they neglected to realize that I had wanted it for takeout.  Honest mistake, so no biggie.  When I got home, I was disappointed in the portion size of the bowl. It was almost all rice and veggies and very little actual meat. The beef itself was tender, but I really didn't feel as I got my money's worth.   Loved the sauce bar, but it alone doesn't make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I am updating my review for this place. They have fixed all the issues and my second visit to the new location was awesome! I'm addicted to the teriyaki and spicy teriyaki sauces."}
{"text":"Everytime I come the food is fresh and the sauces are amazing. The staff is friendly and also get 2 thumbs up of catering to my vegan needs. I get the bento box with grilled veggies, brown rice, garlic noodles, and the salad with ginger dressing and it's really satisfying."}
{"text":"Please go here! The food is great, the menu can be a little confusing if it's your first time there. However they are more than helpful! I'm a customer for life."}
{"text":"Looks like prices are going up and portions getting smaller. Expensive for what you get though food has been good."}
{"text":"This place is great. Have eaten from here many times and it keeps me coming back. Its not sit down eats, just walk in, order at counter, choosing a few things to put together and bam you can eat at a table there or take home. Its a nice quick service.  As to the food, the Filet Plate is bomb and well worth the $9.95. Its always been cooked to be nice and juicy then with the fact that you get the Gyoza or Vegetable Choice, and choice of Fried Rice or Noodles, you can't go wrong. The Chicken plate is good quality chicken breast too and is at a sweet spot price of $6.95. I usually order a couple plates for my family to split so I have tasted all the offerings many times and everything is always delicious.  And if I haven't sold you yet, they have a choice of like 10 different sauces. I've tried most all are good. Those that stick out are the mustard sauce my wife likes. My son loves the yum yum sauce. I like the sweet garlic sauce.  All in all good food, well priced, and quick."}
{"text":"I took my wife to the Volcano Grille, and what a great little Japanese restaurant. We walk up and they have a automatic sliding door for us fat people who are sick of opening doors, I admit it was pretty cool. The decor is nice, the staff is friendly, but the food was excellent for the price. We were sick of eating chicken all week so we were looking forward for some surf and turf.   We order the box with the Angus steak. My wife got the tempura shrimp and I got the sautéed shrimp. For our sides, I got the noodles and pot stickers. My wife got the salad and the spring rolls. Also, we shared a soda which was nothing special.   Then we checked out the sauce bar. They have a lot of choices from spicy to creamy flavors. My wife loves mixing sauces up and I liked the spicy ones. But they weren't abrasive in spiciness, I mean if you call something \"lava\" it should be fucking hot and spicy.   We ate everything and it was great, but the spring rolls were like, whatever. To sum it all up, we had a great experience eating there, however my wife was piss because our table didn't have napkins. We would definitely got back!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews on Yelp! and was NOT disappointed!  Fresh, healthy and delicious!  Staff was very friendly and helpful with the first time ordering and having no clue how to go about it.  Will be returning often!"}
{"text":"This place is okay for being a close local restaurant. My issue is that it seems to be run by high school kids always on their phone and talking about what they are doing after work or inappropriate conversations for customers to be hearing. We came here and my husband loved it. Their sauces are pretty good and you have to try all of them. But the 5th time we went we got good poisoning. So we will never be going back, unless I want to throw up out of my ass again. Which doesn't sound tempting."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised at how decent this place was! First off I highly recommend you pick up a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place. Well worth the value and you will get to try more items.   Volcano Grill is NOT a sitdown-and-get-served restaurant. You step up, place your order and then take a seat. They bring you your containers of food at the table, but they come in to-go bento style packaging. The food is Japanese Grill or Teppanyaki, with out a chef at your table....   The menu is very simple. Pick your meat, pick your rice or noodles, pick your side and pick your salad. They have a buffet bar with a large variety of sauces. My husband and I wanted to try a variety so we went with:   2 fountain beverages $1.69 each (they only have one size now) three of the combo plates with these items in no particular combo  ($9.75 each) -black angus beef  -white tiger shrimp  -atlantic salmon  -lo mein  -brown rice  -fried rice  -steamed vegetables x2  -3 goyzas  -cucumber salad  -ginger salad x2  The shrimp were perfect just as they were cooked, no sauce needed. The beef and salmon were good, and cooked well, but they weren't as good as the shrimp. None of the proteins required any additional sauced, they had good flavor with the seasoning they were prepared with.   The lo mein and fried rice were very good, the brown rice was cooked perfectly. The goyzas were yummy when dipped into the Hot Magma sauce! Steamed veggies were just average. Of the salads, our favorite was the cucumber salad. Next time we will order more of that and 86 the ginger salad. The cukes were crisp and had decent flavor.  The restaurant.com gift certificate that was $25.00 required us to spend $35.00 and so we only came out of pocket about $12, which is better than if we would have come with no gift certificate AND we got more to try.  Overall the food was good. Not amazing, nothing to call home about, but good for a quick lunch or dinner. Volcano Grill will come in handy during lunch time shopping or as a place to pick up dinner on our way home. We will surely return to eat there again."}
{"text":"Volcano Grille makes really good food.  I have gone here over a dozen times in the last couple years, and my favorite is the Bento Box.  They have a wide variety of dipping sauces for your proteins, and I am always full.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very good place to grab a quick bite to eat and the service is always good.  I do t really fault the business when the service is not that great because you get people who are just having a bad day and that shouldn't reflect on the business.  Just let someone know what's going on if you have some issues!  Overall, I like it and would go again and recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for many times for the past 3 years. I like the new location better than the old one. The best fast Japanese food in Town. Steak and chicken are awesome!"}
{"text":"Love it! Delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced. They have a nice selection of tasty sauces.... although this isn't the kind of food that needs sauce to make it tasty... it stands on it's own.  I came here with my Grandmother who does not like hot spices and she enjoyed her shrimp and salmon. I had the steak and noodles. The seasoning was fantastic on the steak and the sauces complimented it nicely and heated it up for me. (I can't remember what kind....creamy version of sushi sauce???) Noodles were great all on their own!  I'll definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good I come here once a week. I get a bento box with chicken fried rice and veggies it comes with salad as well. A lot of food for under $10 it taste just like teppanyaki grill from a expensive restaurant. Love the sauce bar I always get yum yum and ginger!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place the food is awesome and great every time I go very consistent, I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family with no hesitation. Yummy"}
{"text":"I've started to crave this place 2-3 times a week consistently lately. I found it on Yelp and it wasn't too far so I decided to give it a try one day for lunch- now I frequent here and bring friends who always end up loving it also. I always get the Big Bento with Chicken and Angus Beef, grilled Japanese rice (essentially fried rice) and yakisoba noodles (essentially chow mein noodles). So so so good! They all come with small cucumbers and an orange peel which ties in a nice, refreshing flavor.   It is a little pricey, especially if you upgrade the proteins at all (The Angus beef is an extra $2.50 I believe) so it ends up being around $15. It's a good portion of food though and the quality seems excellent so I think it's worth it.  & yes- the sauce bar is awesome! I'm a simple girl so I enjoy the spicy teriyaki sauce most, but there are several fun options to choose from.  Just a heads up- they close at 8 pm sharp- even on weekend nights."}
{"text":"First timer! Food was awsome, steak was right on, shrimp was scrumptious.  I had noodles and fried rice. I have to say fried rice was ok, noodles was way better! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Volcano grille has been my new favorite to frequent. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the place is always clean and nicely decorated and the food it's amazing! I usually get the bento box with steak, shrimp, white rice, gyoza and the cucumber salad that comes with it. Good amount of food for the money everything is seasoned to perfection, the sauce bar is awesome! The only off side is its location it's unfortunate it's hidden. I highly recommend going there though you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I recommend the steak and gyoza. Best sauce is the white yogurt type sauce (forgot the name), great for dipping your gyoza."}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. Need I say more? I don't think so! The sauce bar is on point. Everything is cooked great. Bento style meals with a twist! Food is great & the price is worth is since it cooked so well."}
{"text":"Food was really good, especially the fried rice.  The salmon had great seasoning although it was overcooked and dry. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious. I have been twice. Both times the service and the food were great.  The meat is perfectly cooked and tender. The fried rice is one of the best I have ever had. Love the steamed vegetables. I love the yum yum sauce!"}
{"text":"TOFU! Did I say Tofu? LOL I usually get the bento and I used to get it with chicken, but me love tofu long time! If you havent gone here, its a must try!   The sauce bar is amazing! So many sauces to choose from. The salad and their dressing is also delish!   I had the steak but it was a little tough, so tofu it is! OHHH and they are open on Sundays now."}
{"text":"I really like coming here. Service is super quick, the cashier is friendly and there's never any lines. I usually get the lunch bowl (even for dinner) and it's a good amount of food to keep me satisfied for a long time. I do have a couple of complaints though. One, the prices are a little expensive for their protein sides. Their salmon is an up charge of $2, which I don't mind paying for, but I wish I was a bigger cut. Two, they could lower their sodium level in their food. The grilled rice is a little salty, in my opinion. Regardless, I'll probably continue to come."}
{"text":"The place is a little difficult to find but well worth it if you are looking for great Japanese fast food on the southwest side of town. The place itself is not that big inside, but it doesn't need to be as it seems no one knows about it yet. The guys behind the counter are pretty helpful if it's your first time there. You have the choice of picking your items for your entree and get the option of brown or white rice as well. They also have a big variety of different sauces you can choose from at their complimentary sauce bar. If you go between 2pm-5pm, you get 25% off your total bill. I recommend their sweetened green iced tea! Definately a great spot to grab a quick lunch and somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Food is not good at all !!! Idk they need to change the cooks or something food to salty is like the noddles been sitting all day and rice to ..chicken to much garlic and to DRY burn  !! Never again"}
{"text":"Been to this new location a few times and food went down hill, they are smaller portion as well as  flavors and price. The grade of meat was below average and doesn't taste like when they were before they moved. I am not sure I like this place anymore. Very disappointing. Will not return..."}
{"text":"Tucked in somewhere on Warm Springs Rd between Buffalo & Rainbow, next to unoccupied offices.. lies Volcano Grille. Not a huge fan of the super random location or the dark interior of the restaurant really BUT the food speaks for itself!   Bento or Bowl, it's your choice. We were staaaahrving so we opted for the bento. Pretty self-explanatory, pick your protein(s) & sides. I ordered the Ginger Salad, Steak, Salmon, Gyoza & Fried Rice Combo while the mister ordered Chicken, Shrimp, Yakisoba, Fried Rice Combo. For approximately $9-11, you get so much food! Steak bites were tender, juicy goodness, salmon was seasoned & cooked well, fried rice was delicious & that ginger dressing on my salad.. MMMMM! There's also a sauce bar & my favorite of course, would have to be the Sweet Teriyaki. I paired it with everything I ate & it made everything even better.  This is by no means a typical Hibachi/Teppanyaki spot so don't expect a grill on your table or anything. But it is cook-to-order quality food. I'll definitely be back especially since I work around the area Found another lunch spot & I'm definitely a happy camper! :)"}
{"text":"Sucks to be writing this because the food really is good. But it seems that the portions get smaller every time I come here. You have to pay $2 for premium protein and it's the tiniest serving. Also, the past few times I've come here they've been out of something I wanted to order. Not a good business practice. This last time, the cashier showed that she has no customer service. She just stared at me waiting for me to order. No greeting or a \"What can I get you?\" I know this isn't fine dining but at least greet your customers. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious but honestly, I'm barely in because of the prices.  It's lent season & Fridays mean no meat for me. I came here one random Friday for lunch because I was craving salmon and well, ya girl spent $13 for a lunch combo. I mean, I don't know about you, maybe I'm just sortakinda poor but that is a pretty steep price for me. A bento was already $9.49 for one protein, rice, noodles & salad but because I ordered salmon, $3 was added on top of that price. Three freaking dollars.. for a small piece of salmon. The salmon was seasoned alright but became more flavorful with the sweet teriyaki sauce from the sauce bar (which, btw, is pretty epic). After finishing the salmon with a couple of bites, I was left with so much rice, noodles and salad. $13 did not feel worth it anymore.  I'm not going to argue with the quality and taste of the food. I've had their steak & it was tasty! The customer service is also great and the sauce bar is awesome. Though we are a small group, I would have to agree with a few Yelpers here.. the prices are pretty crazy which makes this place just A-OK."}
{"text":"I was there today with my family and we order a few lunch bento and bowls. The first thing I notice was the atmosphere in this restaurant, quite comforting. Great artwork on the walls. The price is amazing and the food taste so good and delicious. I really love the sauce bar, smart idea. They have great customer service and the place is very clean. I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely go back to it. We drove from Aliante area to just come and eat here. I heard so many comments about it so I had to try. They didn't disappoint!! One of my new favorite place."}
{"text":"I am giving them only 4 stars because the food is amazing and the service is fine but the worst thing is that EVERY 5 min they come and ask you if you done and they can take your plate, you see half of my bowl full so why to ask? And then after another 4 min she ask again,come on you see that I have food in plate can't take a break and be with my phone?? Sorry that I am not eating fast! It's kind of a bothering to ask you 3-4 times if you done and they can take the plate -very annoying and disrespectful"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm going to admit that I walked in here one night (a few weeks ago) and quickly left without ordering because I had my doubts. The place seems to always be empty, the staff is bored and usually that means the food is not great. I WAS SO WRONG!   I came in tonight with my daughter (8) who is a very picky eater. I knew they had steak and rice and she loves steak, so that's what we ordered for her. I got a bento box, yakisoba noodles, brown rice, chicken, veggies. The food came out quick, the steak looked so juicy I had to try one off of my daughters plate.  WOW!  I'll admit, I was jealous of her. Considered asking her to trade, but my food was waiting for critique...  I dove into my bento box...amazing. I am so mad at myself for judging this place as a fail before tasting it.  It reminds me a lot of a teppanyaki place without having to wait for 8 other strangers to sit at the grill with you to begin ordering.    I am thoroughly impressed.   I am confused why this place isn't busy. It's 7:15pm on a Tuesday night and there are a ton of residential developments around. Poor marketing?  Too many food option in the area? Hmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"This place is simple amazing! Been here now about 4 or 5 times and every time I've been here the food has been on point! It's almost becoming a ritual coming here, being that I work with Light Group, ever Tuesday I have a meeting and before or after ever meeting I come here. I usually order the bento box with grilled chicken breast and filet steak, brown rice, garlic noodles and a side salad. The side salad ginger dressing is amazing and so are all the little extra sauces they have. My favorite one is the creamy white one, not sure what it's made up from but it taste great with the filet. Also today I tried a different protein and tried the wild caught salmon which to no surprise was great as well.   Definitely hope these guys can open another location soon, maybe my side of town of Summerlin for this place is a busies location will take off and do really great."}
{"text":"This is a little Japanese restaurant. The new location is larger than the old one. I didn't like the interior.  There was nothing interesting, there are some drawings on the walls that I didn't like at all. The service was not bad though.  Food portions were large. I didn't like the plastic plates (boxes). People, how can you speak about healthy food, when the food is in plastic boxes??????  After eating I can say that this can be called everything, but not Japanese food. Well, the fried rice was good, the salad are so-so. The meat was not bad, but not the best either. Nothing impressing."}
{"text":"Really fresh tasting food! You can tell the ingredients are never frozen Generous portions  The service was really nice, the gentleman who took our order was really pleasant.  Was our first time in and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dangerously close to my house! This place exceeded my expectations after finding it on yelp. I got a chicken bowl with brown rice and veggies. The bowl was huge and filled to the top! The sauce bar was impressive - so many options! It is \"fast food\" like teriyaki madness. The interior design reminds me of a lounge which is kinda strange but most importantly the food is amazing !!"}
{"text":"A new favorite place. Quick and friendly service. Food is delicious. Hibachi without the spectacle and high price."}
{"text":"The food is good.  Good service. I have been there and they were out of certain foods.  Also, what kind of public business does not have a trash can for their customers.  Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Very Good Hibachi style food without the High price. they offer a sauce bar with several fresh daily made sauces to go with your food."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Although this was one of my favorite places to eat, I visited Volcano Grille yesterday and brought 3 new customers with me.  Evidently, the manager and staff are misinformed on laws pertaining to service animals.  I have a physical disability in which I require a service animal.  I was asked for my service dog's ID, which violates the American Disabilities Act.  When I spoke with the manager and showed her the laws pertaining to the ADA, she then told me it would be okay that I stayed but would need to sit away from any other patrons.  Isolation from other patrons is another violation of the ADA.    It has been extremely difficult in the past 3 years adjusting to a new life having CRPS, the most painful condition ever recorded, but feeling as if I am being discriminated against because of it just adds to the difficulties.  Needless to say, I won't be returning to Volcano Grille.  UPDATE:  After posting this review, I was immediately contacted by ownership to apologize and ask how to make this situation right.  The owner agreed to post the laws concerning service animals in his business for all employees to read.  I appreciate the owner's interest in turning a bad situation into a positive one."}
{"text":"Been coming to Volcano Grille for years now. Their location is in the corner of a seemingly abandoned row of businesses but anyone who doesn't take the time to come in is missing out! I love their build your own bento box, you can add what you need depending on how hungry you are. The steak and chicken are amazing and I love that they offer brown rice. They make everything right in front of you when you order on the flat top grill, so it's as fresh as you can get. They have a sauce station that you can help yourself to. The spicy mustard, ginger, and garlic sauces are my favorite. The owners are always there cooking up deliciousness and I love to see the dedication that they put into their business. Volcano Grille is a must try....well done guys!"}
{"text":"This has become a lunch staple (when I am in the area) for me and several co-workers. They do a nice job of quickly preparing healthy bowls and bento boxes. The salad with ginger sauce is a must have item.  A little on the pricey side perhaps, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time tonight and it shall be my last. I don't know what they're doing in the kitchen but coating the food in salt and a pepper is not a way to compensate for lack of taste. I will not be returning, it was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The chicken is the best I have ever tasted!!! The steak melts in your mouth its so tender and flavorful. The portions used to be smaller but I think they are giving you more meat now. Well worth the 6$ for the bowls. Staff is great. I have eaten there several times and have never been let down. A dining experience you have to try!!!"}
{"text":"Omg ! the best fast food in Vegas  amazingly good cant get enough I highly recommend this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town. Fast food teppenyaki that's fast, fresh, delicious, and healthy. Would absolutely love if there was a way to view nutritional info on the sauces, specifically carbs, for those on diets  EDIT: PLEASE post the nutritional information of your sauces so we can continue enjoying your restaurant, thanks"}
{"text":"Yummy!  My bf introduced me to volcano grille at their new location a month ago and we have been eating here one a week!  The chefs are friendly and all about quality! You get what you pay for and that's why some things are additional (steak, shrimp, etc.) but it is well worth it. Today we ordered the bento--certified angus steak, grilled shrimp, grilled veggies and Japanese fried rice and a bowl--grilled shrimp, tofu and white rice. The white rice is good but I am definitely getting the Japanese fried rice next time!  There are many things I love about this restaurant. The service is great, the food has no added sauce (there's a sauce bar so you can control the sauciness and the spice), the shrimp is quality (not like the ones in china town...yikes), they have outdoor seating, and taking food to go always makes my co workers jealous ;)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. We decided to try out Volcano Grille hoping for more sushi choices, but we were definitely happy with what we ordered. The food was made to order, so being gluten intolerant it makes it easier for modifications. The employees were so helpful and accommodating. I explained my dietary restriction and he was so nice and said that he would use my GF soy sauce. Then, he informed me which sauces had soy sauce so I knew which ones to avoid.   I ordered the filet with brown rice and spicy tuna. It was perfectly seasoned and fairly tender.   The 2 employees that were there are now aware of GF (wheat allergies) and hopefully it will be helpful to future patrons. I'm hoping that they will carry the GF soy sauce in house. Other than that, I'm just happy that they are accommodating.   Bottom line, it is on the higher end on the fast food restaurant. Actually, its better. The quality is better than fast food, but the set up is fast food. I will return."}
{"text":"The portions are very tiny. But the quality is very on par with a lot of restaurants.Kinda pricy though."}
{"text":"Fast and healthy little lunch spot. Love how fresh the food tastes and the sauce bar is a bonus. Love mixing and matching different sauces to customize my stir fry bowl to make it that much tastier! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The Spicy Garlic chicken is perfectly done.  I love the bowl with spicy garlic chicken, veggies and noodles.  Add alittle ponzu sauce as well, and you got something really special.  Great pricing, and really friendly service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here one day, because it's his favorite lunch place. I can see why he likes it so much. All the food is really and tastes healthy. Healthy AND good. I usually get the bento box either with steak, chicken, or salmon. The portions are huge so make sure you don't overorder. They even have this little sauce bar type area so you can make your own sauces for your food."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place, and I was really hungry. :( Unfortunately, this place made my bf and myself very sick. Almost immediately after we ate the chicken bento box, we both knew we made a mistake.  I'm not quite sure why our bodies reacted that way, but it's always good to let people know. Ambiance, and location great though!"}
{"text":"Love Volcano grille, delicious almost everytime ! My only complaints; their menu seems to change everytime I go and depending on who's cooking back there... you could get really good fried rice or you might get half a chopped onion with some rice sprinkled on top"}
{"text":"Best service I've had in a long time. The gentleman with the piercing was very very very kind and helpful and his nice lady associate was very kind as well. Will be going back on every lunch break from now on lol"}
{"text":"... WOW! I got the bento box with beef, grilled rice, vegetables and spring rolls it was only $9, I'm stuffed and satisfied!! I ate as much as I could and I still have enough left for a lunch tomorrow! I can't wait to eat here again soon!"}
{"text":"Description for Bento box says it comes with a side salad. We didn't notice until we got all the way home that ours was empty and there was no salad. Quite disappointed considering that was all I was looking forward to the most."}
{"text":"I love how the interior of this place is decorated, it looks very clean and tidy. The service was good, the girl constantly checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay. I love what they're doing with their sauces though! They have a whole setup of different sauces you can choose from just for your bento. I got the ponzu sauce and Japanese salsa for my poke and salmon. So when you order you can choose which bento you want, ranging from what you get on the bento. I got the big bento so I chose 2 sides and 2 proteins, only problem I had was that the only proteins that you can get with the bento without paying extra was just for chicken. Other than that all the other proteins like steak, salmon, or even poke was like $2.50 extra!! Omg so my order would come out to $15 total since the big bento is $10 and the two meats I chose was poke and salmon. I thought that was a little ridiculous until I tried the meats and the quality was actually very good so I mean the extra $5 was kinda worth it. It's still kinda expensive though so I wouldn't see myself eating here everyday, but 4 stars overall in my opinion."}
{"text":"We ordered a build your own Bento box.  The chicken and steak were both excellent.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and the egg rolls were super.  I loved the options at the sauce bar.  This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat.  They have good quality to-go Bento box containers if you need a meal to-go.  Reasonable prices and very friendly.  We plan to return again soon.  2 or 3 outdoor tables with lots of chairs."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since they were at the buffalo location! Great tasting food!  Hibachi style food at a Togo price. It's not cheap, but with every penny you spend. I've had almost everything on the menu and I can't speak negatively about anything! Wait... Yes I can! Because of how tasty their food is, everyone come here for lunch, making the lines long... But I get around that by calling ahead my order!  Lol.    They have a sauce bar! Fresh sauces to select to be placed on your deliciously grilled protein! You can eat it without the sauce because the chicken comes with a garlic glaze on top!!!! It's to die for!  This is my spot hands down!!!! I've run into a few people that I haven't seen in years.... It's the \"in\" place to go!!!! Lol."}
{"text":"Fix that smell!!!!!!  Foods great, service is great, but it's a clear unappealing sewage smell that reeks when you walk in. After a while you get used to the smell so you think you don't smell it anymore but it still there. It could be something as simple as covering a floor drain but whatever it is it needs to be addressed I would've given this place five stars but with that smell when you walk in it's the most unappetizing smell. Pricing is not bad because they give you a lot of food however with all the extras it can add up pretty quickly two Bento boxes with two proteins and two sides upgrading to steak and shrimp and chicken and salmon plus one drink came to just under $30. For a quick service concept I feel like that was a little high however the quality was good the food was delicious and I wouldn't mind coming back again to enjoy it. Please fix that smell and I will be there every day"}
{"text":"I've had everything from tofu to the salmon, everything here is really good, no complaints."}
{"text":"This is my second review but my last one was over a year ago (and I've been back MANY times since then)  This place is a hidden gem! You could easily pass it when trying to look for it since it's tucked away in a little shopping center with a mediocre restaurant in the same complex.   They cook everything fresh on the grill and it's quick! It's inexpensive and the quality of the food is great! I usually order the same thing every time I go so I recommend the filet mignon with lo mein, and gyoza (aka pot stickers) in a bento box. Can't beat it for $10.   The same guys are always there and are super friendly. They often have specials on facebook if you check in so go and 'like' their page!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since they opened and it is still our favorite place to go the owners are really nice. The food is really fast and the really good the gyoza are nice and crispy they have lots of sauces. The price is also really good. Highly recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for months now and this last visit was very disappointing. I always get the salmon bowl with brown rice and vegetables. The \"hot magma\" sauce is delicious. The vegetables are great, rice is good, and the salmon is tasty, and usually a great size. But this last bowl, the salmon was 1/3 of what I normally receive. Disappointing because I recommend this place. Maybe they are cutting portion sizes. If that's the case I'll no longer be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Great food for the price, fresh veggies and tasty grilled shrimp, not much for ambiance but perfect for a quick lunch! Will go again!"}
{"text":"Much like Fix8 Fitness Café in Henderson, this is a spot that focuses on real food prepared with flavor- bonus points for making it so easy to customize for a low-carb diet! Food is fresh, staff is friendly, and they have a sauce bar with 10 different options to add to your dish.  The Bento Box is my go-to, with the choice of two proteins and two sides. The chicken is far from standard here, and the ample portion has a nice grilled char to it. Even better than that is the garlic shrimp, which is well worth the surcharge- almost as good as making it myself! As for the sides: grilled veggies have good variety and I love the dressing on the side salad.  If you're tired of cooking healthy at home, branch out and try Volcano Grille! Once you find the dish you like, it'll be hard to resist coming back frequently. I'll be back to try the gyoza and tofu!"}
{"text":"My husband looooves this place. It's a little out of the way and totally hidden in a corner... but worth finding! The ingredients are fresh and the sauces are yummy.  The restaurant itself is literally a hole in the wall... teeeny tiny w/ minimal seating but it always looks clean!  We've never eaten inside.. IDK y?  We've always just ordered for pick up and ate at home!  Let's get to the food...  My husbands usual:  The Filet Mignon: sides fried rice/gyoza/salad The Filet Mignon is so tender and juicy!  [Obviously i'm prone to just jump on his plate and take what I want!]  If you are a steak lover, this is a good choice.    My order:  Wild Alaskan Salmon:  sides brown rice and grilled veggies More health conscious obviously... I love the salmon.  It doesn't taste frozen and it's cooked just right.  The sauces!  They offer a bunch of different sauces to dip your meat, chicken, or seafood in.  My favorite is the terriyaki and  sweet garlic.  [Make sure you have a mint or gum on hand]  Over all... we frequent this place a lot.  We like it!  It's quick and it's good...   PS:  It's closed 1 day... not sure which.. Sunday?"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! I think im addicted to the filet!!! :)"}
{"text":"I came here the other day .. While I was expecting it to be a sit down restaurant I was a little surprised it was a quick service.. But other than that surprise the food was really good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for cheap lunch. I always get the bento of shrimp and salmon with brown rice. I love their sauces, especially sweet garlic. My boyfriend got the steak one time, and it was pretty good. The chicken wasn't as good though. We'll be back if we healthier fast food lunch for two under $20."}
{"text":"I have been to Volcano Grill twice now. I would give it a 3.5 stars. The first time I came here was with my husband on our lunch outing around 2:30 no one was around except for the window cleaners. It's always nice to have a quiet lunch.   I already looked over their menu so I knew what I wanted to get. I went with the Bento Box, my two proteins were steak and shrimp and sides with rice and garlic noodles. Salad with ginger dressing .79 extra. My husband had the Bento Box also he got the chicken and steak with fried rice and grilled vegetables. We ordered two waters they gave us a little baby cups. So if you want bottled water ask for it.    We saw the sauce bar and started loading up on all the flavors from ginger, teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, yum yum, spicy yum yum, sweet garlic, hot mama, and japanese salsa.   My salad came out first with a ginger dressing which  was very fresh. We waited about ten  minutes for our food to come out. It was hot off the grill and smells so good and taste just as good. It's trial and error when it comes to the sauces, but so much fun to try the different flavors with each meat and vegetable. The garlic noodles are awesome!! The meats were cooked perfectly. I think the steak was the best!! Everything the first time was a little bit greasy. The second time I came with my sister in law it wasn't as greasy. Tried my sister in laws gyoza didn't care for it to much.    The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. Didn't notice the music the first time but the second time they were jamming to rap music from the 80's fun times."}
{"text":"Ever since they moved locations, the quality has been hit or miss, but I still enjoy their bento box. I like that you have the option to customize your box and there really isn't anything else in the area that offers this type of menu. Service is good and they have great sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"All ways a great choice when looking for a filling meal! Service is alway on point and with watching my dining out options double veggies with protein is always satisfying. This is always a go to for me when not eating at home.   Favs: Chicken breast Angus beef Salmon"}
{"text":"Oh my lord! As soon as you walk in you get hit with so many amazing smells that makes you say I want it all!! My girlfriend and I tried the tofu today and I am not big on tofu BUT I don't know what magic the head cook used on it to give it such explosive flavors it worked!! 5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time even before they moved to this current location. If I were to make this review a year ago I would've gave them 5 stars. I love their owners!! When it was just them this place was amazing and I'm sure it has it's good days, but ever since they hired their new staff this place has been going downhill for me. The food is good, but the prices vs. portion size is not right. The staff isn't the best now. My girlfriend and I have had our troubles with them. Overall it still remains a decent place to eat, but I don't think it will be good as it once was."}
{"text":"Love the bowls! The service is always great and they greet me at the door with a smile. The sauce bar is my favorite. Really gives the food a kick! Awesome little location. Can't wait for the next one!"}
{"text":"Hooooolllyyyy crap, I'm writing this review as I'm eating my tofu bento box. I'm going to be a regular soon, it is blasting with flavor. I ordered yakisoba noodles on the side, amazing and delicious. Only thing I'd replace is the salad, I'm not a huge salad fan and this one didnt change my mind on it. Other than that, 10/10. My stomach is insanely happy :')"}
{"text":"Haven't had a good bento box in a while so I decided to try this spot out and I did not regret it one bit. I got the chicken and the beef with brown rice and veggies. Usually when you go to teriyaki places the chicken is kind of bland but the teriyaki adds the flavor to it, but their chicken was different. It had some kind of sautéed garlic mixture on top that made it so flavorful. The beef was tender and cooked perfectly. My favorite part was the sauce bar because I am one to overdo it when it comes to using sauce on my food lol. I mixed the spicy teriyaki with the hot lava, mixed the sweet garlic with ginger and had the hot magma sauce solo. Goddamn was it good lol. This place is easily one of my new favorite teriyaki spots."}
{"text":"I always love Volcano grille! Food is always consistent. The cooks seem to know more about what is going than the cashiers. I enjoy eating in or taking to go.  The chocolate cake is delicious.  My only negative is the place seems a little dark."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to say it, I'm really disappointed with their food. I used to go a lot when they were at their last location and the food was amazing (always fresh). Since they've moved to this new location, the food quality has gone downhill. It seems like they pre-cook the fried rice and vegetables and re-warm them when you order. They used to cook every order fresh. I ordered the chicken with fried rice and vegetables. The dish was warm and the vegetables were soggy. How can that be if it were cooked fresh?  I hope the 2 guys running the place realize that getting the food out faster isn't always better. Please go back to the method that got you there in the first place."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before. This place was so good it forced me to.  Meat is fresh & cooked to perfection. Rice.. Noodles.. Veggies.. Salad.... SAUCE BAR.... ALL ON POINT. Price... well.. if I made food this good with portions this generous I'd be charging MORE that's for damn sure! =D  Staff is ridiculously friendly & welcoming.  Truly a hidden treasure. If you're in Vegas.. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. Some of the most underrated food out there.  - C"}
{"text":"Seriously, when they say be there at noon, GET THERE AT NOON!   The line started right after my group and I got there, and I can see why. I got the bento box (not the big bento box) with chicken, veggies and noodles. My only con was that the noodles were a tad dry, but they have a sauce bar!!! Even for being the \"smaller\" bento box, it was still a great portion size and very filling. Loved every part from the chicken to the salad and veggies and noodles.  Rey the chili teriyaki sauce as well the yum yum sauce (even the volcano yum yum isn't that spicy and great with veggies!). Also, they were pretty fast so ideal for a quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! You can taste the quality and care in each bite. The girl who took our order was very sweet and very patient with all my questions. The beef and chicken were lean and flavorful. The fried rice and noodles were also very tasty. My favorite was the side salad with the tasty ginger dressing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and the service is always pleasant and the seating is comfortable if you decide to eat there. Never had to wait too long for the food to come out. The food is extremely tasty. I'll admit it might just be a little overpriced, but I enjoy the food and the menu so I'll keep coming back.  I always order the angus beef, you cannot go wrong with that. Decided to order the grilled tofu and I've never had better tasting tofu before! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place for a while. I'm pretty disappointed. As soon as I walked in the place looked dark and dirty. Everyone working looked like they were half dead. Once we got our food it just made things worse, not fresh at all. Everything was luke warm at best. Decent flavor but presentation was really off. I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I told my friend that I was going to regret writing a review for this place because you always want to keep your little hidden gem a secret as long as possible.  But I gotta give credit where credit is due and support good food when I find it!  Extremely healthy and top-notch fresh ingredients.  It's pretty obvious to me when a place uses fresh ingredients to make its food.  The steak and salmon I had were as good as it gets. Plus, the sauces make everything THAT much better.  And had I not been completely dead starving when I came here, there was no way that I would be able to truck over double steak AND double salmon at the same time along with fried rice and yakisoba.  That right there is almost $20, but easily enough for two meals on a normal day.  Not to mention that $20 for all that food is almost highway robbery.  The location is...um, questionable I would say?  It's literally tucked in the back corner of a fairly deserted strip mall, which is also surrounded by pretty much nothing.  Needless to say, you're not finding this place unless you're looking for it.  Which obviously suits me as long as it holds out like this!  Service is pretty fast too.  Just put your order and within 10 minutes you got food.  Easy as it gets.  It's rare that I give a five star review like this nowadays, but I call it like I see it.  This place deserves one.  Since my friend is in the area, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A-mmm-azing food.  Everything had really good flavoring even without the extra sauces that are available.  Very decent amount of food for the price.  I especially loved adding the hot magma sauce to my chicken, shrimp and rice. Good music too!"}
{"text":"Such amazing food!!! It was a great find ! I got the bowl with salmon.. I loved all the fresh sauces that they available.   It was a little on the pricey side, but it was still worth it since the food was really good."}
{"text":"For the amount of food you get for $10 is AWESOME! The filet Mignon, tiger shrimp, and grilled chicken was on point! I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because of Yelp! Glad I did, awesome service, and food - that is a double whammy! Finding this was place easy, but if you're just driving around kind of hard to spot out, if that makes sense. It's tucked in the middle of empty shopping center.  The ambience is a small, and a chill vibe. There's not really a lot of seating, and it does get busy - but for me it's first come, first serve.   Me and the hubby decided to go with the bento boxes the first time, you had a choice of protein, rice ( they have brown! for the health conscious nuts ), salad with the infamous ginger dressing, and grilled veggies. For protein he chose filet mignon cut steak, and I chose the grilled shrimp.  Tasty, simple, and easy - and they even had a sauce bar (cute touch). We were so happy with our meals we came back for dinner.   Something tells me we will back again on our days off ;)"}
{"text":"5 little pieces of meat for almost $12 .. way overpriced for how small the portions are! Tried it twice and NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place at the Island Fest at the Silverton a month or two back and absolutely loved the food that they served at the festival.  So, when we discovered that Volcano Grille is close to our house, of course we had to head on over for dinner! The food is super delicious, you can tell that they use quality ingredients.  Best of all, it's fairly inexpensive. You can get a great meal for under $10.  Volcano Grille even passed the test of my 4 year old daughter who ate everything I put on her plate!  The chef's were very friendly and came out and checked on us from time to time and gave my husband input on which sauce to use with his chicken (he likes extremely hot sauce).  We will definitely be back to VG many times! And after writing about it, I'm thinking about heading over there now..."}
{"text":"Love how it's healthy and clean eats... Great execution on cooking the steak and chicken, not over done, very moist, soft, and tender.   First place I've been to that has not over done their meats.  Their sauce bar is awesome, a plethora of flavors!  I love how there's a good amount of options for sides, and major plus is the brown rice and veggies done right.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this amazing place and only found it this past year! This is one of the few places where my two year old actually devours her food. If we could get away with going here everyday we probably would. They run promotions often with prices that can not be beat (their prices without a promotion are very reasonable.for quality food you recieve.) Aside from fabulous food, they have fantastic staff!"}
{"text":"Had always seen this place when I'm at Stacks and Yolks so I was more than eager to try it.   Honestly, it was really just like any other terriyaki/hawaiin/japanese fast food restaurant. The food wasn't bad don't get me wrong but nothing really stood out about it. The price however did, its actually a little bit pricey for what it is.   So there really is only 3 options on the menu but the concept of picking your own protein and side adds a little fun to the process. What I liked however was their \"sauce bar\". They had quite a few different sauces to pick from to add to your meats. My favorite the wasabi sauce, DELICIOUS! The sauce bar definitely made the experience different and worth the trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here only because a friend of ours has been coming here and always mentions it. We looked this place up on Yelp and looked at all the reviews and it all says it's so good.   Finding the place isn't too bad. Gotta have an eye out only because the place is small and it's kind of hidden. Volcano Grille is a kind of like a hole in the wall. Or how they say the smaller hidden places are the best. The atmosphere is chill and the place is kinda spacious. Right when you walk into the place it's the kitchen. You can see them cooking your food. There's also tables right by the separator of the kitchen and the sitting area. Once you walk in you'll hear the good songs they play. Sometimes you might even hear the chefs singing as they're cooking.   The boyfriend and I decided to get the bento box. Which was a good idea. You get a choice of 2 or 3 proteins and 2 choices of a side like rice, veggies, and or pot stickers. The other time we went there I got a bowl and it was good. Good portion for everything. Even the bento boxes good portion for all the sides and proteins.   If you're wanting to check this place out then come here expecting to have a healthier look on the food and come here hungry for some good mood type of music."}
{"text":"I final got around to another bookmark off my list. So much so decided to come again try more of the different sauces. The sauces are by FAR the signature for Volcano Grille that will leave lasting impression whether good or bad. In bigger picture look at the menu it your basic healthy protein, choice of sides, and most part reasonable priced. The thing that became fan on my first visit lead to next week another visit. Not only choice of sauces (honest on my first visit the gentlemen never really gave me the heads up; thankfully read some yelp reviews figure out you just pour any sauces want in dixie cup and enjoy) but choice of protein chicken one visit and second angus beef both cooked spot on, LOVE the mixed vegetables choice (I had been too many teriyaki madness style places in life; the worst part is looking at the assorted vegetable amounts to boiled carrots, maybe broccoli, and cabbage NO flavor) nice selection from roasted red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and think onion also all of the options have nice grill marks well seasoned and perfect compliment for healthy meal. The starch have brown rice but so not fan of brown rice in general stuck with my white rice action. The diversity comes not only to the sauce but choices of protein (chicken, angus beef, shrimp tempura, tofu, and more), sides (brown rice, white rice, yakisoba noodles, and more), and just meal from bento box down bowl action. I did both one day bento box comes with two choices of protein and two sides. The bowl another day its one choice of protein, one side, and vegetables come with it. The sauces the first visit tried the spicy teriyaki sauce and the next visit the sweet and tangy sauce. The spicy teriyaki sauce was good! It not much spicy except for some chili flakes but the base teriyaki sauce was good. I felt like not bottle but fresh made. The sweet and tangy was interesting. It had a nice subtle sweetness but well balance with the tangy part or who knows tangy. Lol! I would use that sauce that again bottom line. I believe over 10 sauces so really can go in every day of the week and not have the same sauce!! The thing about the sauces is no extra charge and can get as much as you like.   The decor is nice nothing really bland but nothing that blow your mind. I do like one wall the art work with the whole volcano and almost village below. The menu is right above the counter nice size so easy to read and figure out your options. The service is awesome. I like the music they play in the restaurant modern current upbeat music."}
{"text":"Overall this spot is great for value and flavor. I usually get the Bento box. And, I usually get the double chicken and double gyoza. This time I opted for the seaweed salad but kept everything else the same. It was close to closing and they were a little busy but not really an excuse to mix up my order and give me beef instead of chicken. I was really looking forward to chicken so I was a little disappointed to find they gave me beef. Was a little too busy and too close to closing time to ask for it to be remade so I ate it anyways. Was ok but nothing bothers me more than having an order mixed up. I always hate to ask especially when you can see it's just a bunch of kids because there's no telling what they are going to do to the food on a remake. I will probably not return for this reason. And, I would suggest that at least one adult be working for supervision."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The price is a bit outrageous at this point though so I won't be going back. $14 for lunch. Dinner would be fine, but there should be some lunch options added."}
{"text":"First time I ate here and the food was great! The best brown rice I have ever had. The vegetable/chicken bowl I ordered was so fresh and seasoned perfectly. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants some great healthy comfort food!"}
{"text":"Food was quality.  Veggies fresh.  Portion just right.  Fresh.  Highly recommend!  Had the large bento with beef, shrimp, mixed veggies and brown rice.  Just like home cooked!!"}
{"text":"This place is another little hidden gem. We usually order two Bento Box with 2 meats and share it between our family of 4. The angus beef is a little upcharge but it's worth it. The sauces are really good, the yum yum and teriyaki are our faves. The noodles and gyoza are our usual choices for the two sides that come with the box.  The ambiance and music is enjoyable and I regularly refer this restaurant to my friends. The only thing that keeps us from coming more often is that they close at 8pm and we are usually just finishing up basketball practice at that time ?"}
{"text":"I frickin love this place for a whole variety of reasons.   1.  The food is always great.  2.  The staff is always amazing and even better accommodating. (I always special order without issue) 3. The atmosphere is nice for either a quiet meal or even a business lunch.  4.  It is located off the highway for easy access.     FYI I was there when the \"service animal\" incident occurred and I would dispute that the staff were smirking or rude or giving the third degree, in fact they were trying to be accommodating to all of their guests, I for one don't want animals around me when I am eating, I am sorry but it is the way I feel and is my opinion, I don't want animal hair flying in my food.  I am always a fair and maybe even a little harsh in my reviews but I think these reviews border on lies, I was there and witnessed it."}
{"text":"First time on this location. Very good food and selection for the price. My only comment is it would be nice to get more of the cucumber salad. Chicken and angus beef is definitely moist and well seasoned. I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Pricy, but worth it if you like large portions of great food. Tried quite a few items and not a single one disappointed. The staff was very friendly, as well. This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Dark and relaxing inside with throw back jams on the speakers, got a kids bowl and I enjoyed it, filled me up perfectly. First time today quick and easy, healthy...I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Soooooo amazing after a great work out!! Carbs, fats, and proteins!!! What more do you want ??!!?!"}
{"text":"cant say enough good things about this meal everything from the meat,sides, service were all top notch.place was clean, good music playing in the background and just a overall good vibe as i was greeted by the cook on my entrance.Yes its a little pricier then going to panda express or the like but the meat was so tender not like a piece of leather at other places,and the shrimp were big and tasted great i will be returning many times for a great meal at the volcano grille..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Tried it for the first time the other day after being told about it multiple times. The food is delicious and extremely affordable. It's a healthy side to a quick dinner or lunch. The employees are extremely nice and efficient. It's owned by two locals and one is always working if not both, and they are both extremely nice! So happy to have found a new go to place for dinner"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because their $10 filet mignon was really yummy.  $10 filet?  Really?  Aaaand the taste was on point.  The fried rice and grilled veggies were good too.  I'm from Cali, and this actually was just as good or a tad better than my favorite $30 teppan dinner at a place called Yanagis.  Seriously, you have to try for yourself.  I told my hubby he need not take me to Benihanas or any other Teppan here in Vegas.  This will do just fine for me."}
{"text":"A decent place.  The food is good, however I recommend you just order the chicken.  Though they have shrimp, steak, and fish (I think), they season everything the same and it all ends up tasting like chicken.  That's not a bad thing however as their chicken is pretty good.  I usually visit here once every other week for lunch."}
{"text":"This 4.5 star rating is really misleading. The food quality is poor here. Nothing is really fresh.   I ordered a two protein bento box. The veggies that I ordered weren't fresh. It looked like they were cooked in the morning or the day before and kept inside a covered pot until they reheat it to be served.   The chicken also looked precooked and not fresh.   Stay away from the sweet garlic sauce. It makes your breath kick even after flossing, 2x brushes, and mouth washing.   For 10.99... You expect the food to be fresh because teriyaki grill is one building down and offers fresh food for less than that.   I hope this review helps"}
{"text":"The food is good but I won't be coming back. For a $10 vegetarian meal that includes a very small scoop of rice  and 2 very small eggrolls (not normal size) and a very small portion of tofu is really not worth it. It's bad when your customers spend over $20 for lunch and both people still leave hungry."}
{"text":"Just went in the other day. Saw great selection for my bento box. Decided to order the large box. And the food came out great. The service was amazing and helpful. The counter person was so great. She answered my questions and made good recommendations too. I've already been back twice in one week!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect food everytime with great service, great flavor and really healthy food. Just wish they would address me master or great king or sifu"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever eaten. The staff is very friendly and the entire place gives off a good vibe. Wide selection of delicious sauces to put on your food. And speaking of the food, the meat is tender and cooked with a fantastic garlic seasoning. Everything is reasonably priced for how amazing it is. Just writing this review my mouth is watering. I have the cravings for it!! Super addicting!"}
{"text":"F*****g BOMB  food was amazing and I don't think I'll ever be able to eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The staff is really friendly and it's nice and clean. I frequent this place at least once a week. They have a really good lunch special but it's small so I have started getting the bento box. The beef is worth the extra money. The food is always fresh and the sauces are really good. Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Volcano grille is our GO-TO spot! Food is always AMAZING and the sauces are to die for!!! The two owners are the main chefs. They are true work horses, get the food out quickly, without ever sacrificing quality. They honestly couldn't be nicer too! The Spring Valley Hospital employees love you guys! You will not be disappointed if you chose to eat here, just don't blame me when you become addicted to the sauce!! Haha"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst location ever.  It's too bad too.  I ordered the filet place with grilled veggies.  Meat was tender and the veggies grilled right without over cooking too much.   The sauce bar is a great touch.   Why anyone would go to the Sam's or other similar places is beyond me.  Nice clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tried this a second time yesterday because I was carless and its walking distance to my office.    It was better than the first time but still kind of disappointing.  I hate to say that because the guys that work there are all really nice and I'd like to see them do well.  I ordered a chicken bowl and the quality of the chicken definately seems better but its still not great.  There were a few pieces I wouldn't eat and the ones I did upset my stomach.  And as others have mentioned the bowl alone was over $7.  I would rather go to Panda for the same amount of food, with a better quality, and a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing food! Everything always tastes so fresh when it comes out. I love the beef and shrimp with noodles and hot magma sauce. If you have not been here, I highly, highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"Finally hit this place up a couple months ago and can't stop going. Delicious!! Steak is tender, noodles and fried rice are BOMB!! And I especially like that they have a sauce bar. Try the hot mama, if you like a little kick in heat."}
{"text":"The personalized service that I've received from the restaurant owners is amazing. I'm so impressed with the amount of care they've displayed for their restaurant and they seem to really care about their customer experience and satisfaction.   When I originally reviewed this place, I had given it an honest 3 star. Since then they have pulled the mock crab plate from their menu and it's only appropriate that they receive the 4 stars they deserve. :)   Additional appetizers are being added to the menu and I can't wait to go back to see what new options are being offered.   I still feel the Filet plat is a solid 4 stars. Consistently great and I'm still thankful that they serve the quality of meat at a great price."}
{"text":"Great food, pleasant environment and friendly staff. The young man at the front register Homar was very energetic, personable and helpful."}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place. Wherever my job takes me, when lunch time comes around, I do a search of my bookmarks and Volcano Grille is what came up so off I went!  This place is kind of hidden in a small plaza on the corner of Warm Springs Rd and Tenaya. If you are not paying attention, you can easily drive right by it. I guess the plaza they are in is still pretty new because some of the suites are still unoccupied.   So I go with the Bento Box. For 3.99 you choose 2 sides from Yakisoba, Fried Rice, White Rice, Brown Rice, Veggies, Gyoza, or Salad. Then you can pick 2 to 3 meat choices each for a charge. Steak is 3.49, Salmon is 3.49, Veggies are 2.49, Chicken is 1.99, and Shrimp is 3.59. I chose double Chicken, Brown Rice, and Salad.  Everything I had on my plate was good and you can tell that it just came off the grill. If you want to, there is a Sauce Bar where they have different sauces you can put on or dip your meat in. I recommend that you get a small serving of each in the plastic cups they provide so you can taste each one. That way you can discover what sauces you favor the most and just get more of that. Also, don't be shy to mix any of the sauces. So far my favorite sauces are the sweet garlic and the spicy teriyaki. I mixed those two together and man, I got the best of both worlds in one cup.   Service is decent. I was greeted accordingly and was explained the process once I told them I was a first timer. Had to wait for my food a bit but I understand it takes a bit of time to cook it. Of course, if you have lots of people here, it will take a lot longer for your food to get to you.  The ambience of the place has a laid back relax and take your time eating kind of feel to it. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs not to mention more outside.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The only thing that I think could improve would be the meat portions. I doubled my chicken but when I got done, it seemed like I could have eaten more. Other than that, it's a solid 4 stars and woudnt mind eating here whenever im in the area."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  I love the people who work there and the food  You can order your steak, shrimp, or chicken any way you want.  They make fresh sauces to dip your food in.   I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"So yummy! Service was great, and food was even more amazing! Loved my bento box with potstickers, shrimp tempura and chicken katsu! Prices were pretty reasonable for the amount and quality of the food. Totally recommend and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Yummm love this place! I thought it closed but found out from a friend they just moved, THANKFULLY! Their angus beef, chicken, and gyoza are my favorite. Numm numm and love their sauce bar for dipping;)"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm on this side of town, usually once a week. The food is great. The staff is always energetic and friendly. The quality of ingredients is always top notch. I've tried everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. The best thing here is the variety of sauces available. It's also nice to be recognized by the staff as a regular. My only gripe is that I have some food allergies and always ask for a special order. On my last visit I was told they couldn't modify orders anymore which was bizarre because they have always done it in the past without question? As I turned to walk out the server asked me if I had any food allergies to which I replied yes I did. At that point they accommodated me but I shouldn't need to disclose that info in the first place. To the owner if you read this, your employee saved your customer today. Otherwise it's a 5 star place."}
{"text":"This just on service.  I arrive at.  This location at 8:20pm.  As the two male employees watched as I got my baby out the car they begun to pull tables in as fast as the could. I thought nothing of it since they close a 9.  When I walked to the door they pushed tables in front of the door.  I walked back to my care and before I could get my baby back settled in the car both employees were driving off in their cars at 8 25. Last call was suppose to be 8 30. The was. Two more customers who entered the parking lot and walked to the door to find they were closed b4 last call."}
{"text":"I went here with my family last night, I ordered a bento box with salmon (extra charge) and shrimp (extra charge) and double veggies to go.  The salmon was amazing and a really decent size, probably about 4 oz..the shrimp on the other hand..I literally got 5 pieces of shrimp, that's probably like 2 oz of food and I'm being liberal with the weight.  While I understand the extra charge for seafood is common in most places I would expect a little more when you're paying a \"premium.\"  Other than the shrimp stinginess the food is delicious and I would go back again."}
{"text":"First time for my husband & I and we really enjoyed the food. There was a minor hiccup with my order, but the cashier was really nice and gave us an extra serving of gyoza. Service was good!  The only thing I didn't care for was how hot it was in the restaurant. It felt hotter in the restaurant vs outside temp of 108°.  I do recommend trying the food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the bento box entree. The premium proteins are very tasty. The employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Volcano grille is a hidden gem me and the hubby found like 3 years ago when it was located on warm springs.  It is now located on Durango which is much more accessible and basically down the street from where we live!  I have had the bento box and also the bowl and both are super tasty! The chicken and steak are always most preferred but all the meat is delicious!  Basically, if you like teppanyaki style food without having to go to a fancy restaurant you will LOVE this place! The sauces are delicious! (Ginger and mustard ones are my faves).  The only thing I'd wish they could change is their hours! Open a little earlier like 11! We're always hungry for some lunch around that time but sometimes can't wait til 12 to eat."}
{"text":"Surprised these guys don't have more reviews. Food is always good and the service is top notch. Definitely feel welcomed whenever I go. Skip the mediocre food and crappy service at Skinny Fats and check these guys out!!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in the portion size. I got the bowl with double order of shrimp and was charged twice for the shrimp upgrade to only receive 6 pieces of small shrimp. But to pay 1.79 extra twice to get 6 pieces is sad. 6 pieces used to be the normal portion size."}
{"text":"In all honesty, if I could give this restaurant 6 stars, I totally would. I've been coming here for about 4 years now & it's still, by far, one of my favorite places to eat. Both the owners & staff are always so friendly & their \"sauce bar\" is seriously to die for. I typically go with a plate of steak, grilled veggies & fried rice and I've never been disappointed. The only bummer is that they're closed on Sunday's, but other than that, I would most definitely consider this place to be one of Vegas' finest."}
{"text":"I haven't been coming to this place since they moved locations and got rid of my beloved Japanese omelette, but I've lately been craving their array of yummy sauces and easy/reasonably healthy and well-priced dinner options. I basically hate the way my husband and most people cook chicken, but here they cut their chicken into bite-sized portions (yes, I am a child who values this) and have amazing fried rice and grilled veggies to pair it with. Their tofu is also a very good option for those who are non-meat inclined, but it doesn't eat the Japanese omelette, which I'm still hoping beyond hope they bring back.   If I'm struggling for where and what to eat and I'm more inclined not to feel sluggish after, but still want that pop of flavor, I'll make my way here for a bento or a BIG bento (two proteins). Ordering ahead is very easy and they are more efficient at this new location. They also play some great RnB music here that the staff, and some customers, will sing along to. The sliding door up front is a bit weird, cause it doesn't open very quickly when you're in front of it, but at least those people ordering massive to go orders get some help on their way out."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh ingredients and service, have always had a great experience. The sauces are amazing I suggest spicy teriyaki and yum yum sauce."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! You have plenty of healthy and tasty options. I usually get the chicken and fresh grilled veggies. The tofu is seasoned and I highly recommend that as well. Another appealing aspect of this restaurant is that there is a sauce bar with sauces made from scratch  ranging from the always yummy teriyaki to more exotic flavors like sweet garlic and Fuji yummy. Eat here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is what can happen when the idea of  Benihana meets the casual laid back Las Vegas babe,    The offspring turns out to be a down to Earth, volcano rock grill in the middle of nowhere street.    Okay, the area grew a bit since I first reviewed them, but I have to admit this grille got me restarted Yelping after a 34 month hiatus from this site; and YES,  this place left  this kind impression on me.  Last time I was there, I had this flashback of  Ed O'Neill doughnut manager character from Wayne's World, because  It seems like  the two owners never leave the kitchen, and live behind that grille.     They chopped and cut with a passion, and take pride in what they consistently do very well.   I have to say this guys can whip up a killer Teppanyaki meal in a few minutes, and it doesn't matter if you're on a diet or not, because they have clean choices for anyone diet.    The selection of brown rice, fried rice, fried noodles, and a really good grilled vegetables are the norm of their bento boxes.    Filet is still my favorite, but the chicken can be addicting.        It's hard for me to say no to this place, because if I pass it....I will come.  It's sad that I spend more on gasoline to come here, compared to what I pay for a meal at this hole in the wall.      Build one in Henderson.....please."}
{"text":"Still love Volcano Grille!!!  I'm going through a period of addiction with their food, thank goodness they're close by.  This current addiction is as follows: craving their food everyday and all day for the last 2-3 weeks, dining in the restaurant, ordering take out while dining in the restaurant, knowing they're open Monday-Saturday 11am - 9pm (with last orders at 8:30), and talking to my friends incessantly about their food.  This is not a craving but an addiction!  I almost want to hold a special party there for my friends just so I can show them how great this place is!  Okay, back to the review...  They got a new sauce bar!  I think it's easier to use too!  On the downside, prices have increased slightly for all menu items...for example, the filet mignon used to be $9.95 and is now (I think) $10.49'ish, most dishes increased by about .50 cents.  Still insanely cheap for the quality and quantity you are getting!  Now I'm telling my friends, \"All of their dishes are under $11.00!!!!\"  The slight price increase is probably due to the paragraph below...  My husband and I were talking with the owners a few weeks ago about how their business is doing and they mentioned their rent is increasing and there may be a possible relocation.  We immediately asked if it will be nearby, and they responded yes it will be (I forget the exact location they said).  PHEW!    Overall, I still think Volcano Grille is a hidden gem.  Though I'm glad most all of you who have tried it like as much as I do!  Gosh I hate Sundays and holidays :("}
{"text":"I think people need to calm down a little bit on these reviews. I mean, Volcano Grill was alright....but nothing to lose it over..  This was my first time trying this place and I was pretty pumped for it considering all the glowing reviews..  Positives-  - That Angus beef is the shizz! Freshly cooked, tender and juicy! - service was friendly - Didn't eat in, but the restaurant was small but cozy and clean - Did I mention the Angus beef was tasty as flock!   Meh-  -I decided to try a bowl with Angus beef with Japanese brown rice with NO vegetables. Check out the pics to see what I got when I got home. Seriously, this is annoying. It was on my receipt and the girl repeated it back to me. So why do I have a bowl that is 1/3 veggies?? - honestly did not care for the rice. maybe I am spoiled by homemade jasmine rice daily (Thank you Mama!), but this tasted a bit stiff. - Kinda pricey. I grabbed the bowl, an extra side of Angus beef, and 4 gyoza (beef pot stickers essentially) and that ran me a little north of $18. No drink at all, since I took it to go. Damn. I just finished all of it and I'm not even full!  -the gyoza were ok. Just ok. Not the best I've ever had. Not the worst I've ever had. Somewhere in the middle.   I really wanted to like this place, but this experience left me feeling underwhelmed. I did love the taste of the meat, but with so many other options in the area, I don't see a return visit any time in the foreseeable future.   I considered a 2 star review, but that Angus beef bumped it up to 3. Who knows? maybe I'll try the place one more time down the road...maybe..  3 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great atmospherw, friendly staff and multiple options in sauces!"}
{"text":"Really liked the food here. Thought it was a tad pricy at first but when the food came out, it was well worth it. Great flavor and perfectly cooked. Sauce bar was a bonus! Get the bento so you can try two meats and two sides. It's extra for beef and salmon, but no extra charge for all veggie, tofu or chicken. They put this garlic sauce on top which makes everything taste great!"}
{"text":"Whatever you guys are doing, keep it up! My boyfriend got me hooked on Volcano Grille and I would eat it every day if that was possible LOL The sauce bar is amazing, the staff is great, and the food is superb! LOVE LOVE LOVE Volcano Grille!!"}
{"text":"For first visit I'd give it a five. Too much? Nah..I didn't have my hopes up before I marched through those doors but damn! For a small place tucked in the middle of god knows where, this is heaven indeed. I had the filet minion bento box, son had grilled chicken bento box and my little daughter had the shrimp bowl. And all 3 were good. Now my son is the worst food critic (@ 5yrs old), yes, at 5. Believe it or not. So when he says the food is good, he means it. Will be coming back!! Amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Another overrated Japanese grill I paid $18 for a plastic Bento Box with 3 small over cooked shrimp, maybe 2oz of heavily spiced \"angus beef\" it had the texture of ground beef. No salad instead for some reason they gave me 2 scoops of half way decent fried rice the egg rolls were the frozen bland variety needless to say I am not at all impressed."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for an after school lunch treat. I usually order the bento box and share it with a friend which usually gets us pretty full, but the dessert is what usually fills us up all the way.   I've had the yakisoba, fried rice, chicken, shrimp, beef, mixed veggies, tofu, and salmon. I like to switch it up each time I go. Everything is usually pretty flavorful, but not too salty, which I like. The flavor of the tofu wowed me, I thought it would be pretty flavorless and I would have to add one of their large selection of sauces on top, but surprisingly, I was able to eat it without.   The only part I don't like is that sometimes the food is overly oily. Once we had yakisoba that was sitting in a pile of oil :/ We ate the top half, but left the extra oily noodles on the plate.   I like that they have a variety of sauces that you can play around with. Personally, I like the magma and the yum yum sauce.   Each time I come here, I order their dessert. They only have one option, but it's pretty good. Especially for someone with a sweet tooth. It's a warm chocolate cake/moist brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. The two temperatures combined makes a wonderfully delicious combination. Definitely would recommended those with sweet cravings to try it."}
{"text":"It was good and affordable.  The customer service was great!  The tables by the kitchen are kind of sticky from the grease & the menu is a little confusing, but the guys are happy to explain it to you."}
{"text":"This place rocks. The chicken and grilled rice is just amazing. The sauce bar has so many options that you can make each bite taste completely different - or just drizzle the yum yum sauce on everything!  The guys who run it are friendly and cool. Place is clean and the new location is easy to get to.  Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very consistent with their food. In my experience, the food has always been more than fair portion-wise, and always made fresh.   I usually order either their steak, or shrimp.  Their steak is so juicy! Just typing about it makes me want to drop by the store, lol. I've had the salmon, it's alright, but better with sauce from their sauce bar (pretty unique).  Hm, atmosphere always feels like it's lacking something? The employees are always friendly, but the restaurant just feels sort of empty. But it's alright, I just come here for a quick bite.  This location is so random and hidden, but if you're looking for a well rounded, fair-priced meal, this is where you wanna be. For example, for ~$9.25, you can order a bowl of yakisoba (or your choice of a side*),  topped with steak (or your choice of protein*), and grilled veggies."}
{"text":"New fave spot to hit when I'm craving some good food with Asian flare. Their sauce bar is tasty! Loved every bite."}
{"text":"I love the Volcano Grill from it's quick and friendly service to the music and decor! The prices are quite reasonably for the quality of the ingredients! The food is always cooked to perfection! I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Let me say something first, if you read any other review that says don't believe the hype  or blah blah blah, look for that yelper and slap them and their mother. This place was amazing. After seeing the bento box constantly show up on my facebook feed, I finally got to find out how delicious this place was. I ordered exactly what they have on their facebook ads. The bento box with beef and salmon. I checced out the condiment station and I strongly recommend the Japanese Salsa. Not only was my order done in under 10 minutes but I think my tastebuds had an orgasm!!! Fittingly, the restaurant had H-Town's \"Knoccing The Boots\" playing and that's exactly what my tastebuds did with the bento box. They made extreme passionate, whispering sweet nothings into your ears type of love in my mouth. I will most definitely be coming bacc to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"A friend told me to meet him here after working out so I did. Healthy option for people trying to stay fit, new year new me type of deal especially being seated almost near EoS fitness ( a gym I sometimes go to if a friend is going).  First off, customer service. Greeted with a nice, \"Hello, how is it going?.\"  Warm vibes to start. Awesome.  Ordering food I got excited cause I saw they had a variety of combinations such as chicken Katsu, steak, teriyaki chicken etc. I chose the katsu and the steak for some extra amount.  Love the idea of having the sauces out just like in a taco shop like Roberto's or lauritas, but they had a few different sauces such as the Katsu sauce of course and a few different types of salsa( I can't quite remember all the sauces they had), but they were pretty good with my meal, cause my meal needed it.  Katsu was layered on top and it was alright. Dry for the most part so the sauces on the self serve came in handy. The steak was a bit overcooked. Came in chewy. Portion wise it was really small compared to some (one of them being makai). Finished it but was still feeling hungry and usually at the latter, I have some to go.  Overall nice concept on fitting in and being a healthy to go spot. Main stars for the sauces and the customer service."}
{"text":"The food was good....the service was not. My husband ordered no onions in the grilled rice and found white onions and green onions in his bowl. There were 3 of us and my food came out about 5 minutes before my daughter's then a few minutes later my husband's came out. They did make a new bowl after we showed them all the onions. They did try to blame it on how he ordered though."}
{"text":"Taste the freshness!!! Good stuff....decent prices...nice employees....and great new location (close to home)....good luck in your new spot......."}
{"text":"I was personally invited to try out Volcano Grille by the owners (who happened to be viewers/subscribers of my YouTube Channel), while visiting Las Vegas for the 2013 Mr. Olympia Expo, the weekend of September 27, 2013. I liked it so much the first time, that I came back a second time just a couple days later.   In my opinion, Volcano Grille has some of the BEST tasting meats that I've had in comparison to similar menu restaurants.   I ordered the bento box with shrimp and steak, noodles, gyozo, and side salad. The food was cooked completely fresh. The chopped up steak tasted better than most steaks I've had in fine restaurants. That definitely says something as I'm a steak kind of guy. It was tender. It was juicy. The chunks were nice and thick. The FLAVOR was perfect. The shrimp was juicy and just right. The noodles were a perfect balance between quality ingredients and oil, just enough of each, whereas many Chinese restaurants have very tasteless but oily noodles. The potstickers (gyozo) were yummy, they reminded me of the potstickers at P.F. Changs. Definitely worth it.   The second time we went there, ordered the same thing but with chicken as an addition. The chicken, was masterfully cooked. Plump, cooked but not overdone, and flavored just right.   They have your regular array of soft drinks as well as a side-bar of different sauces to try your food with. Teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, garlic sauce, soy sauce, sriracha, and several others.    The owner and employees were very friendly, patient, and respectful to me and my group of friends on both occasions.  If you find yourself in Las Vegas on the strip, take a short drive over to Volcano Grille. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the prices are much more affordable than on the strip."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites! I love this place when I'm not up to cooking but still need to eat organic and healthy. I usually call in an order for pick up and have never been disappointed. The sauces really make this place and I personally prefer it over Teriyaki Madness and most of the other local Japanese/ Teriyaki spots. My only gripe is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"My good friend Janice told me about this gem! The food here is out of this WORLD. The staff are amazingly polite.  Big plus in my book!  This is not a Franchise so you won't find this place anywhere else. They have us as loyal costumers for a reason.  The Owner's genuinely care about their business and some of these reviews are wrong. It's not pricey!  It's reasonable for the fresh ingredients they serve, and the portion. I end up leaving full and bringing home the rest of my food.  I've had the fried rice, steak & shrimp. Their food has amazing flavor, my taste buds were craving their food today."}
{"text":"9/10/14  7:30 PM  Same great tasting food, different location.  It's 5 minutes from our house.  My boyfriend's mom told us about this gem 3 years ago.  We've fallen in love with the experience & the food.  Very happy to find a place that we can ALL eat healthy without having an allergic reaction.  I personally like to get the Bento boxes (starting $9) add chicken, steak, fried rice & grilled veggies. Their fried rice is the closest thing I'm used to for REALLY good fried rice.  It's similar to what we're used to on the East Coast. Their sweet garlic sauce is awesome,  but I enjoy the food just how it is.  They have plenty sauces to sample, I usually put a tiny bit in the cup & go up again if I like it. Sweet garlic is my favorite.   The portions are right, priced reasonably & served fresh. Can't wait to go back again. Now we live closer too. I wish these guys the best of luck with their new location. It's a beautiful new atmosphere & centrally located. They deserve it."}
{"text":"I love bento boxes and the fact that you can customize what you want is great. I usually get the angus beef and chicken breast. The meat is cooked perfectly. It's moist and flavorful. Some places you go and the chicken is dried out and chewy. They have a sauce bar which is really cool. I like the spicy teriyaki sauce personally. They have real good dressing for their salads. The best part is its close to my house. The front cashier is awesome. She's so polite and always smiling. The customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Volcano Grille. I had the bowl with chicken and spring rolls. They give plenty of food in the bowl and a free drink for anybody who checks in. There is also a sauce bar with 8 or so different kinds. My favorites were the magma and lava sauces. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place for the past 6 months. I have never, ever had a bad experience here whether dining in or taking out.  Healthy bento boxes and bowls, and in house made sauces. They recognize me whenever I come in (probably because it is 3 or 4 times a week sometimes).  This is a hidden gem and I'm almost scared to tell people about it. Absolutely worth a trip here, and if you don't like it, you're probably crazy."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing! Not so much anymore.... Great at the first location, frequent here a lot, however, menu is changing and product has become less quality wise and more price wise (not a good combo). Still give two stars because it is better than some in the area, however, the last time we ate there both my wife and I got sick afterwards....we won't be back"}
{"text":"Was there about 2 weeks ago! Food seemed to be fresh but dipping counter looked unclean! The restaurant did not se To be too picked up! Good music nice staff ! Food was okay!"}
{"text":"Love this place been there from the beginning will always hit that spot when I visit home chicken noodle bowl with veggies  bomb ! Steaks good too awesome sauces"}
{"text":"Food was FANTASTIC! I don't know why I waited so long to try it! The japanese grilled rice - delicious! One of my favorite parts was the bar of sauces - every single one of them was tasty and mouth-watering. Omar gave incredible service, and went above and beyond. 5 stars all around! :) Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my all time go to craving place. Which is bad...because I'm constantly craving it!  The portions are very good. I usually get the shrimp, garlic noodle, and gyoza. All of the sauces they have to choose from add extra to how great it is. I love this spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered salmon and grilled veggies as my main. Expecting I was going to get a big portion of nutrient dense vegetables like broccoli etc because I ordered the more expensive bento box. Instead got like 5 tiny pieces of broccoli and two cups of brown rice instead. I ordered brown rice as my side expecting it to be a small portion.   Really wanted a nice piece of wild salmon and a big portion of vegetables. Instead got a lot of brown rice and extra carbs for more money spent.   I'm a person really looking for nutrients. And expected that from my ordered. Not paying close to 15$ and getting a bunch of rice instead of vegetables that I told you I wanted as my main. Why am I paying extra and not getting what I wanted. Not rice you pos. Fkin vegetables liked I asked. Gfy. Waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"Stopped by while working in the Southwest.. Needed something filling, quick and somewhat healthy.  Spent $7 and some change for a grilled chicken, vegetable and saba noodle bowl.  One good thing about this spot is that the menu is so simple.  (Please keep it this way!) Easy ordering and price is reasonable.   Service was quick, Juliet upfront brought the food over in less than 10 mins. The sauce bar is ridiculous, wish I got to try them all but Spicy Teriyaki did the job.   Food was great and plenty.  Portions well enough for two meals. I definitely recommend Volcano Grille for your quick-stop somewhat healthy-food stop in the Southwest."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I've stepped foot in Volcano Grille. The protein rice bowl for lunch was flavorful thanks to the spicy garlic chicken which paired well with the crunchy shrimp tempura. By the time you order the food is almost ready and cooked fresh. So what's not to like? Well maybe they could use a little remodeling of their restaurant layout.  Their sauce bar I always thought was a great interactive concept to have.  I was looking forward to the Yelp Check-in Gyoza but unfortunately they forgot to bring it to the table. Yet, I was satisfied with my overall lunch so no biggie."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars only because they stopped serving filet mignon.  I was a big fan of that at their old location.  Now they serve certified angus beef, which is still great, but not as great as the filet.    This is conveniently located at the southwest side of town near 215 and Durango.  This new location is larger and has a more inviting feel than the old location.    I'm a fan of the sauce bar.  Yum Yum and spicy mustard sauce are my favorite.  This is the place to go when you want to go healthy.  They used to have a low carb item on the menu where your plate includes just veggies and protein.  Even though it's not on the menu, you can still opt out the carbs.  You can't go wrong with steak, veggies, and rice.  I would say this is like the fast food version of Benihanas because their food is just as good, but affordable and served fast.    Why go to Benihanas when you can go to your neighborhood Japanese hibachi grill?"}
{"text":"One of the best places on the block. Great location on Durango and warm springs (area), it is clean, friendly staff, amazing food. Decent prices, 12$ or so for a generous amount of food (Big bento). They have a coca-cola freestyle machine which personally I enjoy those. They have a sauce bar which is keyyyy!! #Saucy #LostInTheSauce   My brother got the bowl with rice veggies and chicken and he got a great portion too, for about 9$.   Don't forget to use your Yelp offer and redeem your free drink!   definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place never fail us .. We're still convince that this place is one of our favorite quick fix bento style ... Food is really good here"}
{"text":"Bento box, bento box, bento box!    This place makes me happy with its tasty food, its quick service, it's pleasant customer service, and most of all its proximity to my house.  My favorite dish here is the garlic noodles with gyoza, the filet, and the greens salad with ginger dressing - nom nom nom.   Only downside is that it's closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed to see so few menu options,  we stayed to eat anyway and I am so happy we did.  The veggies were grilled to perfection and the salad was tasty.  I had the salmon and it was so good I can even describe all of the flavors.  The cook really knows how to make good food."}
{"text":"Holy friggin moly!!!!!! This place is AMAZING!!!!!! The food is fresh, I feel like I was at a hibachi grill with 1/4 the price! It's so good I literally can't say enough. The sauce bar.. Of my word!! Try the wasabi mix.. It's creamy heaven. Thanks for dinner!!"}
{"text":"I love the Volcano Grille. The food is always fresh and the staff is friendly and efficient. Lunchtime can be busy because the food is so enticing. Here in or take out. You will not be disappointed. I love the bento boxes and the variety of homemade sauces."}
{"text":"Always part of our monthly stops. Meals are healthy and flavorful. Tofu is a difficult dish to enjoy but they are able to make one that's delicious. Omar helped us out with our meal today- ensured we had a good lunch. I usually order a bento box and I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is sooooo good here. Also, the sauce bar is amazing! I could eat here every day, wish there was one in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I was referred to Volcano Bowl by a buddy of mine.  Its conveniently located close to the office so we pop'd by after work.  Amazing Selection! pretty much a classy panda express! really good grilled chicken and brown rice.  I couldn't believe how juicy and tender the steak tasted!  For me I'm a sauce guy! They have a wide variety of sauces to choose from, each with it's own unique flavor profile that really spices up the entrees! Definite try, and repeat restaurant!"}
{"text":"I usually make a special trip to the other side of town just to eat here. The quality of their food is excellent and it is always fresh and well seasoned. There is also a complimentary sauce bar with 10 different options. The quality of service is always consistently good as well."}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese hideout that you should try out!  I ordered the Bento Box ($9) which comes with your choice of two proteins and two sides (with a small portion of pickled cucumber, like a small salad for your meal) and a regular drink, total came to $11.66. When I received my food it did look a tad small but looks can be deceiving! I was stuffed! Portions were very filling.   An added bonus was their sauce bar, taste buds galore! I tried the Hot Lava and Wasabi sauces. I'm a spicy advocate but the Lava was no where near spicy to me but it was delicious. The Wasabi didn't leave an after sting which was refreshing for me.  I intend to return here to try out their beef and other sauces! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened & have never been disappointed. Bento box is my go-to but can't go wrong with the bowl either. More of a pick up & go type place, small atmosphere but the food is always made fresh. Only thing I've noticed because I've been going here so long is the prices have gone up but you do get a good size portion so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Filet Mignon and Chicken Bento.  Chicken was over cooked and dry.  Filet Mignon was ok.  The garlic noodles were a bit over saturated.  I did like their little \"Japanese dipping sauce bar\".  The spicy Teri sauce was good.  Over all the food was mediocre at best.   For $20, i'd expect a little bit more.  Might return in a pinch, since they are close to my work, but would not make a special trip to eat here."}
{"text":"Really nice place, atmosphere is very cool. Their plates are really inventive. Fried rice is bomb, along with their shrimp. Their service was prompt since you order as you walk in and order off of their easy to understand menu. We would absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend.  Steak and chicken were succulent and flavorful.  They had a bevy of sauces to choose from. The price point was extremely low and the food was tasty.  I will be going back here on a regular basis"}
{"text":"I love there lunch specials. I got the chicken w/ brown rice, veggies & spring roll. Super healthy and good! They have over 10 different sauces, so far all is good!"}
{"text":"So the place is good. I had some chicken teriyaki and it was fresh tasting and what I was expecting. The fried rice was my favorite because it was made just right and had all the seasonings. I want to give this place a 4 star but I'm giving them 3 because I immediately recognized one of the reviewers because of the picture working behind the counter and I don't doubt that another reviewer of this place is a worker either since they both have 1 review each. I would just think that it is dishonest of them to write their own reviews. If I'm wrong about them, I'm sorry but I still recommend trying this place sometime when you feel like eating somewhere new."}
{"text":"Love Volcano Grill! Used to go to the old location, was heartbroken it closed but fortunately it wasn't for good just moved to a better location. Perfect healthy meal for after work outs or afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"This is my go to fast food when I'm on the run and have a million things going on in my day and don't have time to cook. It's so healthy but tastes like your cheating. It's one of my favorite places to eat. I go sometimes 3 times a week . The food is also good to buy in bulk to have as food prep for 2 to 3 days. Makes my life easier when I'm working doubles and trying to get to the gym . It's been a life saver. This place is great for the healthy living lifestyle . Wish there was more locations ."}
{"text":"Good healthy food, I had the regular bento box with grill chicken as protein and grilled veggie and yakisoba."}
{"text":"We just tried this Japanese steakhouse the first time, didn't know what to expect but we know better than judge the book by its cover! Our Bento boxes were elegant on the outside but most delicious on the inside as you can imagine looking at my pictures here.However they need hot nutty Japanese tea badly! We loved the food and the service both where 5*****!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this place and I'm very pleased.  I ordered a bento ($9) with brown rice, wild caught salmon (huge plus for me), chicken breast, and yakisoba.  I'm not really into these type of food places but this place has me sold!  They also have a wide selection of sauces.    There's also plenty of parking in front of the restaurant.  And the staff is very friendly.  I won't be surprised if I'll be there once a week."}
{"text":"Love coming here food is always good no complaints here at all...And so awesome that all this worth the drive  thank you guys.."}
{"text":"I love coming to this to this place so much I just wish I had another location closer to me but this is so worth the drive for me I love the way coming here though"}
{"text":"The front door is just like those in Japan! It slides open. It's on a motion sensor. Cooks look like sumo wrestlers.  I feel like I'm in Japan! Food is served in a Bento Box! They are so cool! Nothing gets mixed up! You pay a premium for plastic that is just wasted.   If you check-in you get a free appetizer. They use quality meat; Tender Steak! They Up-charge for all meat except chicken, and tofu.   Fun place!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. I especially like the wasabi sauce.  Decor is very basic and employees aren't very friendly.  But, you go there to eat and the food is definitely good and there is plenty of it."}
{"text":"Afternoon staff is horrible.  Ashley (cashier) does not listen.  She would rather BS with friends than work.Will not be back!  Update: owner reponded.  He is very nice and wanted to see what was wrong.  Explained and he seems understanding."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The employees are always friendly. I'm addicted to this place."}
{"text":"Always had good experiences at this place until recently. Ordered 30 bucks of food(2 meals) which included paying the extra for the steak. The food came out and was the portion size was exceptionally small compared to our previous visits. We asked the server who acknowledged it too. The server went to the young chef who said the portion size was fine and returned the meals to us looking a little embarrassed. Won't be going back now as awful customer service and for 30 dollars this is not worth it"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and was finally able to go with my daughter. Lots of parking. Friendly and fast service. Very reasonable. Got a lunch bowl with grilled chicken and sides of yakisoba noodles and rice. My daughter loved it. We was suppose to share it and she ate it all, except some rice she left for me. The sauce bar is awesome. Lots of choices, from traditional teriyaki to ginger and spicy ones too."}
{"text":"This place is the best, I use to come here all the time when it use to be at the warm spring location. Im happy that it moved somewhere a little bit closer. Foods great, service is too! I always get the pinto box with steak and all noodles. The noodles are the best, try it!!"}
{"text":"What used to be a Vegas favorite of mine has now transformed into a sad story. Volcano Grill has been declining on a consistent schedule over the past few months. The chicken is now sliced and covered in a disgusting mustard tasting sauce and no longer delightful chunks of deliciousness. The steak has declined in taste and in obvious grade of quality. The portions too have waned into tiny bits and are no more than 1oz per meat ordered. Seriously got 3 tiny shrimps, and I could count the tiny meat pieces on one hand. To top it off the rest of the food was bland, under seasoned and just not tasty. I was with 4 people and they all felt the same way. Finally, the cleanliness of the place was GROSS. Sticky tables and surfaces, glass sneeze guard above sauces looked like someone blew their nose on it and then smeared it around. This is no longer on my list of go to's, sorry guys but instead of cutting corners you should be spending more money and time on your concept, your food and your customers."}
{"text":"Went here today because i was yelping sushi. I don't know why this restaurant came up but decided to go try it because it was literally 4 mins away from my house. As i arrived to the restaurant i thought it was closed...there were only 2 cars out front and the open sign wasn't even on. The entire business complex is completely empty.  After looking through the window and realizing it was still open i went inside. The inside is actually pretty nice kind of looks like a panda express. The menu is pretty basic. Either order Bento Box or Bowls. You basically get to pick a 2-3 proteins and 2 sides. I picked steak and chick for my protein and fried rice and gyoza as my sides.  The steak and chicken were very good, tender meat both cooked in a garlic seasoning. Definitely my favorite. The fried rice was cooked with onions, scallions and some carrots. it was ok. The rice was little too soft for me, kind of mushy. The gyoza tasted like the frozen ones you get at store and thaw and fry, It wasn't bad but wasn't amazing.   I would like to come back here but i find the price the biggest negative. For all the food i ordered and 1 drink it ended up being $13. And it wasn't like you got a lot of steak and chicken either... Teriyaki House on rainbow you get so much food for only $7. Maybe on days where i am really lazy i would go back."}
{"text":"Love their food  Friendly atmosphere and a very clean place. You can decide what kind of protein you want and if you want carbs or veggies. My favorite is the salmon and steak. They also provide a variety of sauces to go with your meal. Would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a healthy delicious meal. This is my go to after working out at eos Durango"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant. Tried the big bento box with steak and chicken. My son tried the big bento box with shrimp and chicken. Loved the sauce bar with over 10 different sauces to try. Will be going back soon to try more combinations in their bento boxes."}
{"text":"This past weekend we tried Volcano Grille for the first time. The food was very enjoyable and the dining experience casual & relaxing.   My Hubby & I both had a bento box--I had shrimp, brown rice, yakisoba noodles and grilled veggies. With the exception of the shrimp, the portions were generous especially the rice--looked about two cups! The shrimp was an additional cost so I was surprised to only get 5 of them but they were well seasoned and delicious.  My Hubby got the certified angus beef, chicken, rice and yakisoba noodles. I tasted the beef & chicken and was very impressed at how tender the beef was as well as the chicken. The bento box also came with seasoned cucumbers which I thoroughly enjoyed. They also have an extensive sauce bar but as usual, after trying a few of the sauces, I migrated back to my favorite hot mustard.   I'm certain that if Volcano Grille wasn't so far from us we'd certainly partake more often but I know if we're on that side of town it's certainly top of our list at this point."}
{"text":"Co-workers and I have been eating here for years. We found Volcano Grille when they were at the old location.  The food is usually good, but it is but and miss. Some days it is great, some days not so great.  The prices are high and have steadily increased every few weeks. We went from having lunch here weekly to every few months."}
{"text":"I usually order the plate special with Salmon. It's pretty much a grilled salmon with a choice of rice/chow mein and veggies or bokchoy. However, it's the seasoning that really makes the food sing. Their dishes are savory, well-seasoned, and flavorful, and I like how they make it to order. Prices are very reasonable, and I love the generous portion on the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Clean establishment Friendly staff DELICIOUS FOOD! I definitely recommend giving this place a try!!"}
{"text":"VOLCANO GRILLE IS SO YUMMY!! I was lucky enough to find them here on yelp about 2 years ago and have been a regular since. This is Volcano Grille 2.0 with a newer and nicer location as well as some new menu items.    I'm really picky about eating at places that have high food quality, and their food surpasses my expectations. My favorite items are the chicken bowl and omelette roll bowl since I have a smaller appetite, always with fried rice because it is by far the best I've ever had. I also love their steak, even though I'm not big on red meat. It's certified angus beef and you can really taste the difference in how flavorful, tender and juicy it is. Yum!  Don't let this amazing local business pass your radar, you NEED to try it!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my boyfriend and I's favorite lunch spots. Healthy, full of flavor and bomb sauces."}
{"text":"If you like teppanyaki (benihanas style cooking) you've gotta try this place.  The food is as good as what you'd find at a $50/person restaurant like Benihanas but costs less than $10/person.  The filet and the shrimp are spectacular.  Both the fried rice and yakisoba are very delicious dishes to complement your meal.  They have a sauce bar and I'd recommend the yumyum sauce. If you like spicy try mixing the yumyum withe the spicy sauce.  Both the fried rice and yakisoba are very delicious dishes to complement your meal."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check it out because of the reviews and I like to try things at least once just to say I did. So first you have several options where you get to choice a protein or 2 and a side or 2. Like a bento box or a bowl. They have Angus beef,shrimp,tempura shrimp,chicken, tofu and  a couple other options. They have several sides of rice and noodles. Their sauce bar is what seems like endless because  there are so many amazing flavors. Some were spicy some were sweet but all equally delicious!!! Loves the fried rice, the shrimp, shrimp tempura, and the spring rolls. Delicious, fast, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in strip mall! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was not expecting to be so completely surprised and impressed! The quality of the steak was 5 star restaurant quality and the and the seasonings are beyond good. Amazing selection of about 10 sauces, none of which are necessary but all of which are perfection. Fine dining food with casual ordering and seat your self and quick service with great prices. We need one in L.A.!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, came here to get s steak and shrimp bento box and a kids bowl, kids loved it, sauces are great, this reminds me of a hibachi to go style restaurant..... Love it will return the only thing I was confused about it it says 10.49 for a 2 protien 2 sides and my meal came out to 15 but she said its cause I got shrimp and steak but either way I paid under 25 for 2 great meals kids being 4.99 with a drink, also no drink included in meal fyi"}
{"text":"Tried their food at Bite of Las Vegas. Super friendly, clean, and great food. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"i'm going to keep this short & sweet every item on their menu is delicious! the staff is soooo kind! their light lemonade is the best i have ever tried! their sauces! i literally get lost in the sauce! soooo many choices! & if i'm being honest their food doesn't even need the sauce to taste as delicious as it does! it's just a must try place!"}
{"text":"Ew no, God no.. This is an old review i wanted to share since i came across some old photos.  I was under impression i was going for something light, but our order came out quite heavy and was saturated with sauce.  They even have a self serve condiment bar with MORE unique type of sauce.  Really? Are they trying to hide something here? It's a lot of work to find a condiment we like, and i think we ended up liking the the ginger one.  Now what's it for? I have no clue.  It's rare but this is one of those time that having too much can work against you, nah mean?  The salmon was overly salty, but I must admit the Filet Mignon was tasty.  I'll give it that.  The whole meal had too much going on.  In fact the whole concept was just overly done for me.  I left a little disappointed and apologetic to my sis for taking her here."}
{"text":"First timer, the food was so good and the wait time was surprisingly fast! The staff was very friendly and extremely catering."}
{"text":"I have now been here 3 times for lunch.  It is a little out of the way from my office but today I have now affirmed it was worth the trip.  I usually have the Bento Box with Chicken, Fried Rice and Vegetables (it also comes with a little salad).  I wasn't sure how many stars to rate this place as I needed a benchmark.  I tried a more nearby competitor of theirs (Rice Trax) which got good reviews the other day and I can say now that Volcano Grille has them whooped and is at least a \"star\" better.   I also would like to comment on the two guys that are in there each time I go - and that is they are very polite and friendly.   As far as the inside goes, it's nice.  I have dined in each time and it's nice and comfy and quiet in there.  The only suggestion I would have is to conceal the storage under their drink machine with a curtain or something.  Overall, I have enjoyed the lunches and the atmosphere and it will be a regular place for me at least once a week."}
{"text":"If you want to eat DELICIOUS, superior quality, food for a healthy body and soul, have   lunch or dinner here!  For me, the food has got to support my low carb Ketogenic Diet.  The Volcano Grille is a friendly, creative, and casual atmosphere!  It's comfortable.  It's uniquely Traditional and modern in Japanese design  My Steak with fresh Veggies was perfection!    I had the Tender Angus Certified beef, cooked Teppan / \"Teppanyaki Chef\" style.  Excellent!  My wife told me that her 'Wrap' was sooo delicious!   An original restaurant.  Six years in the area.  However, it was our 1st time at this new location  The sauces were amazingly outstanding!  The Volcano Grille's own fresh Sweet Garlic and the fresh Ginger Sauces are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Came here last week on a lunch break and it was surprisingly tasty. I usually don't try anything new but I'm happy I did. They have a sauce bar which is nice if you like lots of sauce like I do.   I had the teriyaki chicken bowl with white rice and no vegetables.  Will be returning soon :)"}
{"text":"I visited the place based on 4 out of 5 stars. First impression was a less than enthusiastic cashier. She drank soda while working the register, and never smiled. I am a picky customer in only one area, and that is customer service & cleanliness. This placed failed at both polite staff, and a clean environment. The side area was disgustingly dirty as well as other parts of the restaurant. I didn't dare venture into the restroom. Food was not good because it was cold and had no flavor, and was very overpriced."}
{"text":"First time here with my wife and we really enjoy the food. Came very fast and was cooked perfectly!  Not a lot of places have fast service and great food so I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food always cooked to perfection. Friendly cooks I like that u can watch them cook the food and the sauce bar is pretty cool to try new stuff. Their new location has fixed the demand issues they had at their old location. Food is always amazing, if you haven't, check it out!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this a 3.5.  Good food.  Tasted fresh.  Sauces were good.  They had chop sticks and didn't assume I wanted a fork. :)  Bonus.  But a few things were a bit weird.  It claims to be a Japanese restaurant, which is great, cuz I love Japanese food.  But on the menu they have Lo Mein and Bok Choy.  Both are *Chinese*.  Also on the menu are Gyozas and Mochi, which are Japanese, however the lack of consistency did offend my sense of \"all Asian cultures are *not* the same\"!!! :)"}
{"text":"Good old Yelp, once again you have lead me to another yummy place.... I have been wanting to try this place out but hadn't found the time however, they had a booth at the Pure Aloha festival and when I tried a sample of their fried rice I knew I had to visit this place!!!! We really liked the food here: Chicken Breast plate with fried rice,gyoza & green salad. I love that with the sauce bar you can get several sauces and with each dip it's like you've ordered several chicken dishes. I appreciate that the chicken isn't dry and actual flavored good with garlic so you may not even need the sauces. The fried rice was so yummy!!!! We also got shrimp shumai-Yummmm.... The salad and gyoza were good as well.... I really liked the magma and spicy teriyaki sauces best..... I would go out of my way to eat here and sadly  it is located in a small strip mall place with no other buisness open in there so I hope this place continues to prosper on it's own!!!!!"}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise. A new favorite restaurant. Very good quality food, excellent flavor, presentation, service. A very good value."}
{"text":"Healthy fast and a ton of sauces!!!!!     Its hidden in the corner in vacant shopping  center with no Signs... I asked why and they said we are buzy enough as is!   GOLDEN GEM.  A Must try and you will become a repeat offender!"}
{"text":"You MUST check this place out!  Get a Bento Box with steak, chicken and fried rice and prepare to have your mind blown!  Best Fried rice I've ever ingested.  Hibachi style food.  They also have a dipping sauce bar! Try them ALL!  It's a \"cozy\" venue."}
{"text":"I love the yokasoba and the steak.  Its teppenyaki but without the tricks and the heavy price, but better food than any Bennihanna you will ever step foot in.  I frequented the old location on Warm Springs and Tenaya and I'm so glad they moved to a location that has more potential.  What's unique about this place is that the food is so good that all their customers, ney fans, want the owners to not only succeed, but thrive.  If you try this place once, you will become a fan."}
{"text":"Very good stir fry food. Steak and chicken is cooked very good , great value. Shared a box , vas very satisfied . I will return"}
{"text":"Food was fresh & served up quickly.  They offer a variety of delicious sauces but food was already tasty on it's own.    Restaurant was clean. Service was excellent.    It's located on the other side of town for me but my daughter and I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"TL;DR delicious. Get the steak.  I'm shocked that I never actually looked at this yelp profile before. Living by this place for 2 years now and I've thought it was a hibachi place like ohjah or Benihana. Nope! It's more like a fast & fresh place.   Being that this was my first time, and clearly not what I was expecting to eat, I stared at the menu for a good 5+min. It would have been helpful to have someone ask if it was my first time and maybe explain the menu a little to me. Also, even though it was close to closing time, all of the tables were dirty. Gotta keep up on that!  I ended up settling with a bento box with the steak, katsu, noodles, salad, and spring rolls. First off, the food is really good. No question about me coming back there. The steak was so tender that it had the same taste and feel to what I was expecting at a hibachi. The only thing is that there were sauces in a thing up front. I didn't realize those were sauces for customers to grab at random. I had walked by then and ate my whole meal thinking \"man, some good sauce would top this\". That's something that could have been avoided by someone explaining how the place worked.   Last thing, and not really a negative, but the sliding door confused me lol. It took me a second to realize there was no handle. However, this is genius! Why don't every place do this?!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot! I got a teriyaki chicken bowl with veggies. They have so many different sauces to choose from on the side - my personal favorites are the classic teriyaki and garlic. My roommate who I ate here with got one of their bento boxes which is a great way to sample more of what they offer!"}
{"text":"Would've given this place 3 stars but after seeing the portions of meat I paid $2.49 extra on top of the $10.99 I was a bit disappointed... After paying almost $18 for 1 person, I'd would rather drive to Gyukaku on Spring Mtn... This is my first time visiting and probably be my last... Been trying to find my Teriyaki fix since I moved here from Seattle, but found NONE that can compare... The quality of food was mediocre... The taste was mediocre... Yakisoba Overcooked tasted a bit peppered like peppered beef jerky... Gyoza tasted as if it was previously frozen or bought from Costco... Only good tastes were the variety of sauces they provide... Good place to try once, but not something that you would be craving for...  Good Luck!!"}
{"text":"What a tasty place! Everything is made to order and all of the meat options are amazing! The staff is always friendly. This is an easy place to eat healthy. They have a great little sauce bar that has loads of varieties. We eat here often :)"}
{"text":"This place is in an awful location, hidden in an abandoned retail center and is a little dirty which would usually be enough for me to say stay away and not look back.  However, this place puts out good food for a great price.  Despite the dining area having sticky tables and badly needing a visit from a dust cloth, the kitchen area, which is fully visible, is kept very clean. The food is cooked fresh and is really worthwhile. I especially like the steak bowl because they use fillet and it is always tender. If you are in the neighborhood and are craving a good Asian bowl at a great price this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Just got done eating a Chicken breast plate. Both me and my co worker ordered the same thing.  We were hesitant at first due to the no one eating in the dining room.  We both enjoyed the our plates and surprisingly the chicken wasn't dry.  You really don't need the sauces, but they were all great.  Favorite sauces were the Magma and the Ginger.  4 stars due to not having all the sauces"}
{"text":"We came in last night completely starving and had never been here before.  We were greeted by the nicest guy ever Luize and we told him that we were not quite sure how to order he was so enthusiastic and he helped us with our orders I honestly have never been treated so nicely .  We didn't have to wait long for our delicious food and we loved all the sauces they allowed you to choose from.  I will for sure go back here and not just because the food was great but also because of your Luize staff member .. I sure hope his manager sees this review it was last night around 7pm or so."}
{"text":"Idk if it's a 4 or 5 star, but its nice if you want to grab a bite.  Taking a break from teriyaki madness and samurai sams is nice.  Plus the music they play is relaxing and different from most businesses with music in the background.  The yakisoba noodles taste pretty great, and the sauces are interesting and refreshing to have if you wanna try em out.  I will come here again"}
{"text":"I love this place, is very close to where I work, I always order ahead of time, and when I pick up they are always ready, their food is very good quality, their chicken has no hormones, or antibiotics, very tender & fresh. & their rice is a must order. Their service is very attentive & friendly."}
{"text":"finally tried this after living in this areas for over a year. ordered to go... as I walked in the staff was sitting at the front casually hanging out but the cashier jumped right up and got me food that was ready for me.   the place itself is very very small. much smaller then I thought. they don't seem to busy at all for 5pm dinner rush.  when I got home, I tried the food which I have to say was amazing!  I had a bento box with filet mignon, shrimp, salad, and rice. the filet and shrimp were amazing. the meat was so tender and cooked to perfection. the fried rice and salad were average. the food all together was hot so it was obviously just made. everything tasted fresh.  can't wait to have this again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places with good prices and an even better taste. It's worth the drive if you're looking for something casual and tasty."}
{"text":"For something quick to go this is great. I've actually been craving it a lot lately. My only issue is how they do their price structure. They advertise a big Bento box for a certain price but the only options is veggies tofu or chicken. So if you want the good stuff like beef or shrimp add on an extra five dollars. For me the beef is worth it very tender. I have had a few times where the bigger pieces of beef are almost rare though... Obviously this still haven't stopped me from going in there! Oh ya don't get me started on all those yummy sauces"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place, found it a little over a month ago and been there prob 5 times since.  It's like eating teppanyaki to go. Pretty fast considering I would change a few things but overall very tasty.  Wish they had a surf and turf bento box. (hint, hint) Staff really cool and food seems pretty fresh. Right on Volcano grill.  Sauces need a little help I will say. Like which one is which and how long has it been sitting there almost empty. And some I think are mayo based and little to no ice keeping them cold. Kinda scary but F it, way better then panda or some other BS."}
{"text":"We had the bowls. Hubby had the lunch bowl with steak was a good size for lunch but the meat was so little that he has to get the shrimps on my bowl!  Don't miss out on the sauce they are really good with the spring rolls. Decent price for the bowls but I wish they had more meat in them."}
{"text":"O.M.G. I will never go to a chain teriyaki restaurant again. Everything about this place is amazing. I ordered a protein bowl and they have so many options for their protein. I chose one of their premium meats, spicy chicken with brown rice and grilled vegetables as my side. They have a lot of side options too rather than your standard rice and veggies. (Free gyoza with Yelp check in too hehehe). I like to think of myself as a sauce connoisseur so you can imagine how thrilled I was when I saw their plethora of sauces. They have spicy teriyaki, Japanese salsa, yum yum, ponzu and more. I got the spicy teriyaki and ponzu which complimented my protein bowl perfectly. Major plus is they have one of those high tech soda machines where you can pick any type of soda and with flavorings.. you don't see that everywhere! Another plus was the customer service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have always LOVED Volcano Grille. I order it to go on my lunch break at least once a week. I used to always get the chicken bento box but have recently become a vegetarian and could live off of their tofu. What do they put on it? (Seriously if you are reading this and feel like divulging your secret please let me know) I have never had better tasting tofu. The portion sizes are good and I usually cant finish it all. My only complaint would be I wish they opened a little earlier because sometimes I have to take lunch at 11:30 and they don't open until noon.  Their staff are really nice and take time to remember their repeat customers. 5 Stars, I will continue going back frequently!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I can, every time I'm like \"hmmm what's bomb AND healthy?\" Volcano Grille bee-otch. Food looks and smells good is always presented nicely.. I order the basic chicken wiff white rice and noodle in a bowl but you get a good amount of food for the price. High quality and really good service. Tip them they really do a good job in the kitchen"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to give this place a try! We are so happy we did. He ordered the Angus beef (steak) and I got the chicken breast with veggies and brown rice. The Angus beef was super tender and flavorful, you can tell it was high quality meat! & The chicken breast was cooked perfectly, not overdone or lacking of flavor one bit! They also have a fully loaded sauce bar for those of you who enjoy that extra kick! The employees were friendly, the atmosphere was super chill and they even play R&B music, so you can't beat that! We will definitely be coming back! This is a great spot for lunch. Great job Volcano Grille!"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem!- outstanding tasty food in a casual setting. Every portion in the bento is grilled just right, and has its own distinct flavor. Best of all they have a wide variety of homemade sauces available at their sauce bar free of charge- affordable prices as well . highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, bento boxes and bowls are terrific. Fresh and tender chicken/beef/shrimp! The grilled rice is terrific, and it is nice to get the brown rice when I want to opt for a healthier choice. Home made sauces omg. Try the Fuju-yummy and mix it with the magma - holy cow! (C'mon people, 1 or 2 (not 5) rammikins of sauce per order or why not offer to pay more, yeesh!).  Volcano Grille is delicious, clean and the owners at the grill ensure meticulous attention to details that many don't bother with. Sweet servers, great location, 6 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great place for 1/2 the price of a regular teppanyaki restaurant.  Highly recommend and love the variety of dipping sauces even though I get your \"yummy sauce\" all the time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! You can get two plates full of food for the price of one hibachi plate at Ojhah. The combination plate I typically get is the steak, shrimp with half noodles and fried rice. I also appreciate that fact they have a bar full of sauces. I like my dipping sauces so I get a variety.  The sweet garlic, Siracha, and Yum Yum sauce are my favorite.  I put Siracha on the rice and noodles.  I dip the shrimp in the Yum Yum sauce and the steak in the sweet garlic. Volcano Grille definitely has replaced my craving for pricey hibachi places.   Don't let the practically empty parking lot scare you into not going.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, when I'm feeling lazy and want to order in I turn to Yelp..pretty often these days. This restaurant is always the first to pop up and for whatever reason I always ignore it. Until last night!   I'm always looking for something convenient but healthy. I can't believe it took me s OMG to discover this. I ordered a bento box (which is gigantic by the way) and only $10..Japanese grilled rice (fried rice) was so good along with gyoza. All together order time and pickup my husband was back within 15 minutes. New favorite!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Being vegetarian it's not always easy finding quick, tasty grub. I have been getting the bento box with grilled tofu. ( something I normally don't like) all the tastes are amazing. I love that they have a boatload of sauces to choose from as well. Do yourself and favor and try this tasty joint!"}
{"text":"I was a little concerned when I first arrived because the mini mall has no other businesses in the complex. However when I got inside it was nicely decorated and clean, which is a huge thing in my mind.  I got the bento box and added chicken and teri sauce it was divine! The little pot stickers were outstanding I can't wait to share this place with my friends."}
{"text":"Great little Asian food grille.   Stopped in for lunch and tried the big bento. You get two meat choices and two side options. Great flavor steak was tender and juicy. Portions are good for the price.  Not a lot of options but sometimes that is better. Just make a few items and make them great consistent."}
{"text":"From my top 5 and 4 stars this place is going down definitely! Was waiting 4.30 min waiting for someone to take order and nothing 1 person does it all here I guess. Food is not fresh anymore and taste like it was made in the morning .so sad"}
{"text":"Got the bento box with the steak and salmon! Pretty good especially if you put the yum yum sauce. There fried rice is pretty good as well. A lot of food and will definitely fill you up!"}
{"text":"Volcano grille used to be at a different location down the street. If I remember correctly, it used to be where Japaneiro currently is. Anyway, I used to come here quite often after a good workout.   The food itself is pretty healthy since they don't add sauce to anything. You can choose your own dipping sauce and they have plenty to choose from - anything from creamy to whatever you call sauces that are the opposite of creamy... lol I like that they have different proteins such as chicken, steak, shrimp, etc!   I'm not quite sure why I stopped going to this place but it's a really good healthy option compared to the rest of the places around. From what I remember, service is fine but it's only to the extent of placing your order (I think but I could definitely be wrong)."}
{"text":"I love the rice bowls here I've had tofu, salmon, shrimp great size just to keep you satisfy and so good. I just wished they would open earlier like at 11 ."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!!!! Food portions and taste is the most kept Las Vegas Secret!!!! I highly recommend great customer service also as a first timer they recommended a couple options based on what I wanted. So great thanks a bunch for a wonderful tasty dinner!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good. So why minus one star?   The price for the amount of food doesn't match up. I checked yelp, looked at all the pictures, and thought it was going to be perfect. I didn't realize people are zooming into their pictures to make the food like a decent amount.  When I am starving, this wont be the place I go to because I need more food then the portion size my four and five yr old eats.   When I need a snack, I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Will be returning for sure! So worth it! You get your protein veggies and carb all in one meal."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good. It's a must have everything I'm visiting Vegas! The food is healthy, yet so delicious! Everything is always getting better! Highly recommended!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Next time you are in the mood for Panda, drive down the street for something healthier and more delicious!  The portions are excellent for the price! (My friend is severely allergic to seafood and had the steak while I had the shrimp tempura. There were no complications or issues in cooking the food safely. She made it out alive! Yay!!)"}
{"text":"Fast, Fresh, Healthy, and Cheap teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Food is good!  But check your order before leaving. ..they messed up my order.  It was dead when i was in there.  The kitchen staff was probably too lazy to cook up some beef, and gave me some left over chicken that wasnt even hot.   Called and spoke to Luis, who told me that he will replace the order next time i come in.   We shall see.  He didn't seem too sure as he spoke to me.  Sounded like a young guy that was trying his best to resolve a customer complaint.  Lol."}
{"text":"So excited about their new location! It is so much easier to get to the restaurant off the 215. I love their menu because it is simple and clean. You have your meats, veggies and sides all laid out for you. You can customize your order to exactly how you want; no wasting money of sides you don't want to eat!"}
{"text":"This business will not stay open for long if they do not fix their price point. This was the first time I have been here.  I scoped yelp & found this place.  There was even a free 2pc gyoza so I decided to try it.   I ordered the salmon bento with 4pc spring roll (side order).  The salmon is not worth the $13.28 i paid for.  Neither is the $2.99 for the spring rolls.  The frozen salmon that you can get from Walmart is bigger than the one in the bento.  The biggest section in the bento box was occupied by the salad & not the main entree. They had a sauce bar which was a \"sure I'll try that\" afterthought for me, but totally just a space filler on the counter.  To end on a positive note, the rice was cooked well & so was the noodles.  (See photos for reference) I am not going back.  There are other places to spend your $20."}
{"text":"Yummers!!  I ate the cod and grilled veggies and salad.  All very flavorable.  I will be going there again!"}
{"text":"Good food, good music, great staff, variety, and omg the sauce bar is amazing.   The angus steak upgrade is always worth it. You can tell all of the ingredients are high quality and freshness. I've tried the steak, shrimp, tempura shrimp, salmon, and chicken and all have impressed me.   I recently stopped eating rice so I opted for veggies the last time I was there. I was expecting some lettuce, carrots, broccoli, you know the standard steamed veggies. Nope. What I got was a pile of steamed/seared tasty goodness. Seasoned well, shredded carrots and zucchini, with hand cut broccoli and onions.  I always go for the magma sauce with some lava mixed into it. Amazing flavor and not too much heat.  Next time you're in the area, give it a shot. Your stomach will thank you"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Customer service was great and it's very family friendly! The sweet garlic sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Holy COW!!!! What a discovery!! I'm clearly the last person to hear about this place based on the plethora of incredible reviews.   My boyfriend and I came here yesterday for lunch after I scoped it on Yelp. The boyfriend almost* vetoed it, because \"how good can a bento box really be?\"  It can be INCREDIBLE!   He had the steak bento with the salad, brown rice and veggies. I opted for the chicken breast, salad, veggies and brown rice.  The steak here is incredible. Seriously. I know what you're thinking... c'mon Laney, how good could it possibly be? Well... it's tender, not chewy, not stringy, and tastes like the ribeye at Hakkasan. Boom.  The chicken; also fantastic!! It comes cooked in garlic and is all white meat with no chewy-tendon-y pieces.   The brown rice was perfectly cooked, the veggies were fantastic-- not mushy or weird-- super fresh.   Couple the fantastic meal with the fact that they have an entire sauce bar and I'm in my happy place. The sauce bar has teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, spicy mayo, yum yum sauce, creamy miso, wasabi dressing and more.  Some people complain about the pricing at this place, but it's really not that bad! Wouldn't you rather pay a couple dollars extra for an incredible meal, rather than get a cheap crap meal? Life's too short for bad food!  *Will be coming here again, and again, and again!!"}
{"text":"Great place,  go there once a week.  I always get the two proteins steak and chicken with grilled rice and veggies.   Lots of sauses to choose from but only two really stand out for me,  the spicy teriyaki and hot mustard for the steak. The rest aren't to my liking but over a great place.  Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Funniest thing is that I waited. Till they moved further from me before I tried them.  This location is set up pretty nicely.    I tried the bento box with steak, tofu (yes, they have tofu), fried rice and grilled vegetables.  It was good.  I won't say it's great because that would demean my other reviews.  The food was decent.  I liked the available options and the flexibility.  Pick two from this group, pick two more from the next.  How hard can that be?    And the tofu, extra firm, grilled and had a garlic topping.  Pretty nice option.    I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Love this place, good food but the bento box is overpriced. I love all the sauces they have."}
{"text":"Really great food. The beef was cooked to perfection as was the veggies. The noodles didn't have great texture like they were pre packaged but still good. All in all I love this place but can't see myself eating there often it's too pricey to go by myself often and because you order at the counter I can't see ever taking a date there. Maybe a gf but not a date. It's in a weird category. Great food, expensive, yet not really a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food and great price. Reminds me of the Musashi or Benihana taste without the obnoxious, over the top \"show\". This is perfect for me. I will routinely return. The steak and chicken were delicious. I had the yakisoba noodles, which were also good. A nice change from the typical teriyaki spots."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better. Food is absolutely delicious and service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but for the price the portions are very very small. Don't come here hungry. The chicken wasn't hot it was warm when I got my bento box. If everything was hot and a decent size portion of a dish for the $10 I would've gave it 5 starts. I think I'll stick with teriyaki madness around the corner."}
{"text":"I was extremely satisfied with stop in here to try the food , one my favorite types of foods. Ordered a tepanyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and macaroni salad."}
{"text":"get the bento box with grilled chicken tofu, veg and rice, taste okay, nothing special.."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day! Love that they make everything fresh to order. Customizable sauces, proteins and veggies! Sides are bomb.com. True neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"This place has a very good vibe feeling w/ awesome food and employees! I'm so very happy that I was introduced by my two fabulous BFF's Sufa & Jay! Thank you for always treating me as a vip upon every visit to your restaurant! The music you play rocks! Keep up the awesome work! -Larry G.-"}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love this place! I've been visiting this place for 3+ years!  The staff are all so awesome and they work so hard to make this a successful business! Kudos to all of you and thank you for the continued extraordinary service! Food is always so delicious! I'm very picky when it comes to my food lol and I have no complaints here! FYI...They play the best music ever! Getting my groove on while choking down on my food! Congrats all and thank you so much! Keep smiling and to many more successful years ahead!"}
{"text":"Been passing by Volcano Grille a lot these days and the Husband and I finally decided to check them out.  (Didn't hurt that they had a gift certificate on restaurant.com either.)  We definitely were surprised with what we got.  First off - Volcano Grill is a fast food Japanese restaurant.  Walking in, there's the counter and register right in front of you.  You put your order in and pay first, then grab your condiments and take a seat.  Our food was brought to us in to go containers despite the fact that we were 'dining in'.  \"The Plate\" options include your choice of protein (filet mignon, shrimp, wild alaskan salmon, shredded crab, chicken breast, or vegetarian); choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein; choice of cucumber salad or ginger dressing salad; and choice of grilled vegetables or 3 chicken gyozas.  Your price is determined by the protein choice.  For the two of us, we choice three plate options.  * Filet Mignon Plate with Brown Rice, Grilled Vegetables, and Ginger Dressing Salad ($9.85) - The beef was tasty and the grilled veggies mostly consisted of napa cabbage.    * Shrimp Plate with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Generous with the shrimp and tasty too!  The gyozas were enjoyable as well.  The cucumber salad is a pickled salad.  * Wild Alaskan Salmon with Brown Rice, Gyozas, and Cucumber Salad ($9.85) - Although it wasn't bad, the salmon was our least favorite.  They did get the orders mixed up a bit (wrong side or wrong salad with our protein choice) but we did get everything we wanted.  (Not a big deal since we were sharing, more of a concern if you're picking up for a bunch of different people.)  Although the price says $9.85, I think he may have rang us up for a higher price.  So double check.  I also ordered two regular soft drinks ($1.49) but he rang us up for two large ones ($1.79).  Which wasn't a big deal since we were dining in and they have the cool iced tea machine and soda fountain to help yourself to.    In the condiments section, they have a bunch of different 'special' sauce that you can help yourself to.  Ultimately, you don't need them, but they are nice to have.  (Hot Lava, Yum Yum, Ginger, Teriyaki, Spicy Teriyaki, Hot Magma, Sweet Garlic, Sweet Onion Chili, Japanese Salsa, and Spicy Miso)  They pride themselves on a menu that has nothing over ten dollars, which is true.  They also offer a cheaper \"The Bowl\" option, which comes with white rice and grilled vegetables.   Overall, the food was good.  It's more of a lunch option, not some place you'd go out for dinner though.  As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed.  This is far from a teppanyaki experience though!   3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was very good and fresh. They had a sauce bar so you can spice it up or make it sweet. Hit the spot after a long day of hiking."}
{"text":"Had the bowl with salmon, grilled veggies and noodles. First time and it was pretty yummy! Way better than Teriyaki Madness!! My kids came first and raved about it so me & Hubby came to check it out! It's pretty good! Portions are healthy and the food is fresh. Highly recommend it and will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot! Healthy choices for post workout meal. This is probably gonna be my new post work out spot since it's in between my place and LVAC. Love the employees also, they're very helpful and as soon as I came in, they all have a big smile on their face. It's very affordable also. Must try, especially if you're trying to eat clean!"}
{"text":"So friendly and the food quality is 5 star.never had a bad bite here. Every bite is perfection. The lunch bowl is amazing for a small snack or the 3 meat bento is great for a super hungry night."}
{"text":"First time here. It was good. Our favs are the beef, noodles, fried rice (both white and brown were delicious). Grilled veggies were ok. Chicken was ok. Huge portions though."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but we went a half hour before they closed and got a chicken bowl with rice and some yum yum sauce. After eating it I went to bed. I woke up puking and my stomach was in knots. Did I really eat bad food!? Was it the sauce that was sitting out all day or the chicken not cooked properly? On top of me being extremely sick, I had an exam that day. I was unable to study because I was over the toilet all day. Ugh it was the worst pain ever."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. Not kidding. Great meal for a gym rat. It's a great size portion and not expensive. Right across the street from Eos gym so I'll be a frequent visitor. Plus the service was incredible. Stephanie at the register was so nice. Perfect little spot."}
{"text":"I was really sad to give this place 3 stars because their food is so good. I got a shrimp and chicken bento. Everything was amazing and the flavors and their sauce bar.  I had to get my food to go but I live 2 minutes away from here. However they were out of sauce on many trays so they were all watered down, my shrimp was FREEZING COLD it was inedible, their grilled vegetables and rice were cooked perfectly though.  9/24 I had to change my review because 5 hours after my food (the only meal I've eaten that day) I've been throwing up non stop and running to the bathroom every 5 minutes. Worst food poisoning ever. PLEASE CAREFULLY COOK YOUR STUFF. I am literally dying"}
{"text":"Holy smokes is this place good!!! I'm a pretty healthy eater (to say the least) and this place over exceeds my standards! We ordered the Bento box which includes two proteins, two sides, and some really delicious pickled cucumbers. This meal was about 13$ and it was HUGE!! The service was superb, the lady in the front was very polite and always had a smile on her face! Let's not forget that they have organic grass fed meats and fresh ingredients. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good eats, great atmosphere.  When We walked in we were greeted and felt welcome right away.  They were playing some old school jams definitely loved the ambience not too loud and not too bright inside.  The hostess was amazing and friendly as were all the chefs!   Their menu is pretty simple pick between a lunch bowl, bowl, a 2 item bento box and a 3 item bento box.  You pick your proteins and sides.  They have a sauce bar for all the added goodies.  The food is sit down or take out and the wait wasn't long at all.  It was a little pricey $41 for two people without drinks but between girlfriend and I we both had 2 salmon, 2 shrimp and a steak those are extra not covered in bento box cost.  The portions were just right I wasn't starving after and I wasn't feeling stuffed.  We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I went in on my lunch break one day to try out their bento boxes.  I ordered brown rice, garlic noodles, diced salmon, and diced filet mignon.  As you can tell with the pictures posted on here, Volcano Grille tries to bring a menu filled with healthful options (salad, choice of carbs, and protein). While this may be the case, flavor should not be compromised. I was actually a bit disappointed because their food was not packed with flavor.  I understand that they have a bunch of different sauces to pick from and take to go, but at least make the flavors of the actual food stand for themselves.  And no, the seasoning of the garlic on the noodles, and the rub on the fish did not really help.    Besides their food being a level or two above the borderline of bland, staff was really helpful.  The noise level is a bit average here, not loud at all.  The dining area was very clean, so I appreciate that.    I would say that if you do not really want to be impressed and are looking for just \"ok\" food that you can just smother a bunch of sauces and sriracha on, consider going here."}
{"text":"Amazing Food! Great customer service. The selection of different sauces is out of this world. The hot mustard and magma are to die for. I'm definitely a regular moving forward."}
{"text":"Brand spanking new place right in my neighborhood! It's located in the corner of a strip mall that is for the most part vacant, so I can see why i'm the first to review it.   It's a teppanyaki type restaurant, but without all the fancy tables and onion volcanos. I think it's actually a good idea since I like teppanyaki but sometimes I don't need the whole show, weird people sitting at my table or annoying birthday songs. It took them about 5 minutes to make my to-go order and considering they just opened, it seemed fine to me.  I ordered the Ckicken Teppanyaki plate with Bok Choy & Fried Rice. It was all cooked right in front of me, all the ingredients looked and tasted fresh...not too shabby, seems a lot healthier than Panda Express.  The price was a little over $7 without a drink, I guess that seems fair. The decor is simple & modern with dark brown and reds. What kind of cracked me up is the Teppanyaki chef guy still had to add a little flair even though I don't think it's neccesary, I guess old habits die hard.  Overall I'll go back, it's a very new place and hopefully it'll do well."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Volcano Grille ever since they moved to this location and finally did yesterday for lunch. Went in and saw only 3 other people (around 12:30) in there and decided to have it to go. I ordered the big bento with two protein (beef and shrimp) and two sides (fried rice and yakisoba), everything had a lot of black pepper in it. The beef and shrimp were both extra charge on top of the base $10+ for the \"Big Bento\". I could only see that chicken did not have any extra costs to it but salmon and poke both having to pay extra for also. Why all the extra charge for their protein items, I don't get it. The food was okay but very bland. The only thing that really stood out was their use of black pepper in all the food I had (beef, shrimp, fried rice, and yakisoba)   My lunch came out to $18+ with a regular drink, not crazy but did not feel it was worth it. Good thing they have all those sauces to add flavor to the food but overall I did not enjoy it. They do give you a good portion of fried rice and yakisoba, but I just did not eat it due to lack of seasoning and did not want to pour sauces over rice and noodles, ended it up wasting food. The beef was tender and the shrimps were okay but I think T. Madness right around the corner would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Eh. Food was less than average. Not worth what I paid. Nothing memorable. Not sure I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Had the lunch box special.  This is being offered for dinner until the end of the month for $4.99.  Not bad.  Small portions, but good food.  Service was great.. Very friendly lady.  Nice atmosphere.  Clean. Just a little bit larger portions would have made this a 5 star..."}
{"text":"can't say I am a fan,as I found the price not so reasonable as most of the proteins had an add charge, which made the lunch headed toward dinner prices??? the food is tasty and had spice/sauce bar, missing was the garlic chili sauce. I needed some of the sauce to give it ba-zing different from the salt seasoning on the fish... And there are other places to eat , so they need to compete with their prices,as it is a drive from summerlin and I probably will not go back, unless someone else treats ,lol...."}
{"text":"Really good food, and easy to order menu. The lighting sets a casual, comfortable mood, and the place is always clean! I enjoy eating here when I get a break from work. Jade is amazing! She's always very friendly and she has great customer service! I'm happy she's very good at her job. Thanks again for the great help Jade!  Pros: Good quality food Food is thoroughly cooked Plenty of sauces to choose from Staff is really friendly Clean establishment Easy to find parking Great music  Cons: N/A  Overall: Prices are reasonable. Food tastes great. Staff is friendly. (Stephanie is amazing! She's really courteous and helpful. Very knowledgeable do the menu as well. Thank you!) Location is near lots of other businesses and the sign is visible from the street. I like this place. It's my only 5 star rating on yelp for Vegas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Great options for the Bento Box. I had the shrimp and chicken. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the chicken was juicy. The sauce bar is great as well. I loved the spicy teriyaki. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice customer service , chill atmosphere , received food pretty quickly and the food was amazing . Glad we decided to try this place . This will be regular spot for us now."}
{"text":"A fast casual dining spot in a strip mall. The food is yummy and they have a sauce bar that gives you so many options. The service is friendly and the plane appears clean and maintained."}
{"text":"Customer service was meh and the R&B playlist sounded like it belonged to some heartbroken girl but man oh man was my tofu yakisoba bowl tasty! I decided to try out Volcano Grille before a painting session at nearby Design and Dine because I wanted some REAL food that I could enjoy in peace. Plus, I've had this place bookmarked for a while. The extremely affordable bowl option, which includes 1 protein and 1 rice or noodle and the option of veggies, is what sealed the deal for me.   TOFU YAKISOBA BOWL W/VEGGIES ($6.99): Can someone please tell me how to cook tofu like Volcano Grille? Seriously, this is some of the tastiest tofu I've ever had in my life (and I eat a lot of tofu). It was seasoned and cooked to a perfect texture that made it easily sliceable with a plastic fork. I loved the spread of colorful fresh veggies in the bowl - red bell peppers, broccoli, green onions, carrots, and white onions, oh my! I added a cup of spicy teriyaki sauce from the sauce bar for an extra kick. The serving size was just the right portion.   VIBE: Volcano Grille is like a more authentic version of Teriyaki Madness. Same concept though - a quick serve restaurant where you order at the counter and help yourself to fountain drinks and tableware.   Worth a Return Visit? If I'm in the area, I would definitely eat here again.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #191"}
{"text":"soooooo good!!! really enjoy all the sauces!!! the food is made fresh to order & is so tasty!!!"}
{"text":"thank ye internet gods for yelp otherwise i never would've discovered this gem located just a stone's throw from my new apartment. volcano grille shut it DOWN today: got the Bento w/steak, chicken, noodles, gyoza, and threw in a .79 side salad with that bomb ginger dressing for good measure. delicious, tender, juicy meat, amazing house-made dipping sauces, and very sweet (and cute!) boys workin' the counter. literally the best meal i've eaten in weeks all for a piddly $11. get used to seeing my unshowered mug boys, cuz i'll definitely be returning frequently.  kinda sucks that this place is located in a totally dead ghost-town shopping plaza so they're not getting the traffic they rightly deserve. do yourself a favor and pop in for a meal this week, you won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"Great for lunch or a quick dinner - it's a great \"different\" food joint in an area filled with fast food options. It's my favorite lunch spot to go to when I'm tired of the usual lunchtime food.  Located in what is currently a barren strip mall tucked behind Brentwood Tavern - Volcano Grill is literally - in the middle of nowhere!  What I really like about Volcano Grille is you can get a hearty meal that's fresh and healthy for a pretty decent price. All food is cooked to order. The bento box with 2 proteins is the way I went the last time. Steak and shrimp were my choices and next time I am just going to ask for double steak.... The shrimp wasn't so bad, it was just that the steak was THAT good! I think it was the marinade and sauce that were just perfect. Mix it in with your rice and savor every drop!!  While dining in can feel a little awkward (I prefer to takeout) - there are still places to sit and eat. Although when we went in April and ate there - the air conditioner wasn't working very well so it got pretty hot very fast.  They've changed their menu a couple of times over the past few years but the food is still the same great stuff.  It is definitely worth looking for and trying!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here before, it was really great. I'm very happy this place turned out to be so good! My son had a tempura wrap and I had a angus steak bowl with noodles and veggies. They are super nice and very helpful when we ordered. It's like a small Teppanyaki place and we will be back often. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their food!"}
{"text":"Volcano Grille is tucked away in a little shopping center with a bar. My friend told me that it has been here for two years and I was stunned. How does a business that does not get much traffic stay afloat for so long?   The reason, most likely, is that they have solid food. It is better and healthier than fast food. The prices are a little steep for the serving size, but it is a healthy portion. One of their bento boxes is a good amount for an adult, but not as big as other restaurants.   Each order starts with a protein of choice. My friend got the the shredded imitation crab meat (6.95) and I got the filet mignon (9.95). Next is the choice of starch. The options being white, brown, fried or chow mein. We both got brown rice and there was no extra charge. +1 for not charging for brown or fried rice. Then comes either veggies or gyoza. We got an order of each. I prefer the veggies. They were steaming hot and retained their crunch without being too hard. All boxes come with a salad as well.   While waiting for the order, we looked around the sauce bar. They have such a large selection that it was hard to pick one. Luckily, the bar is open for as many samples as you want. The sweet garlic, spicy teriyaki, and hot magma sauce were probably our favorites. They also have yum yum, hot mustard, sriracha, ponzu, lava, regular teriyaki, and an unlabeled sauce with onion bits in it. It is cool to see an Asian restaurant have a salsa bar style amenity for their guest.  We also got an order of shu mai because we had wanted dim sum, but missed our time window. They were not that good. Next time I will pass on those."}
{"text":"Food presentation 2/5, taste 3/5, price 2/5.....we ordered 2 steak bento and 1 chicken bowl.  Chicken bowl was a joke....80% rice....15% veggies and 5% chicken.  Serving size was just a joke.  Rice Trax....we will be coming back to YOU!!!  This place needs to also clean up their sauce bar...sticky everywhere and a mess --- service...lackluster. Bleh, won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is nothing like a Benihana style teppanyaki place and I'm not a big fan of the uber-teppan chain. It's a teriyaki chicken bowl fast food place. Walked in, it didn't smell or look appetizing so we left. FYI - Fellow Yelpers a teppanyaki place typically cooks on a flat grill in front of the seated customers, look it up."}
{"text":"This place has very good food, but whoever is answering there phone needs to be fired!  2 days in a row I've called them and there phone is busy.  Not just once, but repeatedly for an hour straight.  Very annoying"}
{"text":"Come with the expectation this is not a fine dining or traditional Japanese establishment, it's more a fast food/take out joint.  They have a very limited menu of items.  I tried the filet mignon/garlic noodle/gyoza bento combo and the filet was cooked to a perfect tenderness and flavorful! The gyoza is standard fare...definitely not home made.  The only gripe I had really was with the garlic noodles, they really lacked in any kind of flavor....but perhaps that is why they have the unique sauce bar concept.   They have about 10 dipping sauces available, ranging from spicy teriyaki, teriyaki, fuji yum, hot magma, japanese salsa, ponzu, etc  The sauce that stood out to me was the fuji yum...I felt like dipping all the food in it, including the filet =).  The noodles I ended up pouring spicy teriyaki over it to spice it up a bit. So really i would give this place a 3.5 star rating, perhaps I didn't understand I was to pick my own flavor for the noodles at the sauce bar....but generally I prefer my food pre-flavored rather than having to do it myself.  Overall, I would probably go back if I needed to order to go or for a quick lunch.  Food comes out fast, but that may be due to the fact they are not too busy.  There really is no service to rate, since it's a pay up front and grab a seat kind of establishment."}
{"text":"Never have had a bad meal.  Once we had a some-what long wait for food. But their boxes and sauces make up for any waiting we had to do.   We usually get the bento box with chicken and steak, fried rice and pot stickers.  Can't go wrong.   Small place, get there early for best seating. They are moving soon, so make sure to visit their new location."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal here. sometimes the wait can be long. That's only because they are busy. Their bento boxes are simply the best. I always get steak chicken and pot stickers."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place . I like the food , not love . Convenient . Love the sauce bar! Food is decent quality however , I don't think the steak has ever been cooked well done as I have requested . My biggest complaint would probably be the price of the bento box. By the time you add your meats and sides it cost more than it does to go to Oh Jah and Have the full hibachi cooking in front of you experience."}
{"text":"abolutely love this place. the owners are the guys serving you so you know your going to get something great. only complaint is the shumai isnt really traditional, more of a frozen out of the box type. either way highly reputable. small place in the mddle of nowhere and kinda easy to miss if you dony know where to look. some outdoor seating should be added possibly, but other than that very nice place and food is fantastic"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is delicious- just tried Salmon for the first time and it was AMAZING!!!! Everything tastes so fresh and is seasoned so perfectly. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  I enjoyed visiting this place recently and I was surprised at how well these guys do quick and delicious Japanese cuisine.    I ordered the bento box with the filet mignon, fried rice and veggies.  The price was great for the quality of dish they served me!  I love the sauce bar, especially the Japanese salsa.  Overall service was attentive and personal.  I WILL visit this place again and that says a lot since I live across town."}
{"text":"This place is underrated. People should eat here as a healthier alternative to the likes of teriyaki madness and similar. Everything is fresh and meat taste of higher quality. Love to eat here after working out."}
{"text":"The owner got back to be about my missing orders within the hour. Which I greatly appreciated, great customer service is very important for a business! Not to mention their food is so so so delicious ! I will  be eating here a lot more often and will definitely recommend to friends :)   Quality 5/5 Taste 5/5 Customer Service 5/5"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant in the southwest for fast healthy food. Forget teriyaki madness or ghengis grill this place is amazing. When my husband and I moved into town three years are we left behind this amazing Japanese grill in our college town that had \"yum yum sauce\". We haven't been able to find it since until we stumbled on this gem. The sauce is not \"healthy\" by any means but it is yummy and totally worth the splurge when you go here. Got the bento box with beef and chicken. Huge portion, absolutely delicious, you won't regret coming!"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service, amazing food! Nice relaxing restaurant! I love that I can eat in or take it to go. Now the customer service, hands down the best!! Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. The food was great and the service was good. I didn't like their pricing structure though. There is a bunch of ad on pricing that makes it not really that affordable."}
{"text":"Whoa!! This food is amazing. After working near this restaurant forever, me and a co worker finally decided to try it. I got the fried rice and chicken, and my co worker got brown rice and steak. He really enjoyed his food, and mine was so good. The chicken and rice was so flavorful and seasoned perfectly. I ordered it for lunch again today because I really wanted a good meal. Thanks Theresa for helping us with our order! Volcano Grille, YOU ROCK"}
{"text":"Great concept. I feel like there aren't enough Japanese take-out places out here in Vegas.  There should be more, and they should take after Volcano Grill... or better yet, VG should expand!  Easy menu.  Healthy options.  Nice decor.  Fresh & authentic flavor.  There were just two little things that got to me: (1) Prices seemed a tad high for the portions given - but it wasn't critical, it's like paying for quality instead of quality (2) The location is all the way in the small Southwest corner of Vegas - I only found this place because the grub at Ikea looks like dog food  I'll definitely come back again, but dunno when.  I already have a couch."}
{"text":"Thought I already reviewed this place, but turns out I just left a tip. I love.love.love this place. Food is reasonably priced and realtively healthy if you opt for the brown rice. Steak is soooo tender and tasty! Hoping more people figure out about them, they're in a 95% empty strip mall and it's always pretty empty when I stop by for dinner and I'm so afraid they'll go out of business. Have eaten here regularly since discovering it (like once a week) and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I always crave this after the gym since it's so close by. They make their angus beef so soft and tender! The noodles are cooked until there's some crunch in the noodles! The bowls come with a good amount of food and choices in their bowls, the service is excellent as well! I just wish they would close later instead of 8."}
{"text":"Been here a fair amount of times. I usually call in a to-go order after work. I have yet to actually eat here at the establishment but it doesn't really matter.  I recommend the Bento Box $10.49. You get 2 items and 2 sides. There's a decent amount to choose from, although, most of the items you have to pay a little extra (such as the Certified Angus Beef +$2.15, Shrimp +$2.35, Premium Salmon +$2.99, Shrimp Tempura +$1.15). The ones that come at just the bento box are chicken breast, tofu, and grilled vegetables. So most of the stuff are at a little extra charge. I usually get the beef and tofu. Tofu isn't what I expected but still enjoyable nonetheless. The portion for the beef is very small so just a heads up.  In terms of sides, I usually get white japanese rice and grilled veggies. The gyoza in particular is better than expected, so definitely recommend that.  If you don't want the bento box, they also have the $7.99 bowl which gives you 1 choice of protein, and either 1 rice or noodle. I have yet to get that since I prefer the bento box but this is a great option if you're not as hungry.  Service is great. You only interact with the one cashier pretty much and they've always been friendly to me."}
{"text":"Overrated. The fish was off and definitely not worth the price. The sauces were ok wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Thanks to all fellow yelpers for the great reviews.  I was in the area and craving rice. Been sick all week and looking for comfort food.  Went in with an open mind. I ordered the steak and shrimp with brown rice and veggies with a side salad. I pretty much ate everything but walked about disappointed and still hungry.   This location is really random and hidden... no one was dining in and the employees looked bored.  For the price point, friendly customer service and menu options... it was okay. If you live or work in the area this is a decent lunch spot.  Would I go back? Probably not. Not to keen on the serve yourself sauce bar... where everyone touches the sauces.  Lunch for 2 with set you back around $20."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great food, great prices. Love the sauce bar, unique and wonderful idea! Nice atmosphere. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I also was puzzled as to how someone could review a restaurant without eating there.     The Volcano Grille has superb food. The owner/ chef is incredibly skilled in Japanese cuisine and it shows in everything I have ever eaten there. The food is seasoned to perfection, cooked beautifully, and the sauce bar is the perfect compliment to a spectacular meal.   Don't judge this book by it's cover. This is no franchise chain fast food... It is fresh, delicious, Japanese cuisine... And best of all it is very inexpensive and prepared to order!  FIVE Stars all the way."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and SO delicious. The Angus beef is perfectly cooked and tender. The gyoza is to die for and they have best fried (grilled) rice ever. And the salad is so refreshing and perfect.   They have a sauce bar with some awesome deliciousness. The sweet garlic sauce and the yummy sauce are... Well... Sweet and yummy!!    I've been going to volcano grille since they opened at their previous location but this new place even better. Roomy, good music, nice comfortable seating and a casual but nice vibe.   Truly a pleasure. Friendly staff, great chefs, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I've come here maybe 3-4 times now. I really like the service here, from the first time that I came to anytime after the guys here have always been so friendly and helpful.   The first time I got the bento box with shrimp and steak as my protein with fried rice and gyoza and a side salad. I was VERY happy with the steak omg just thinking about it now has my mouth watering it was SUPER tender, flavorful, and scrumptious. The flavor was on point too...LOADED with garlic, which I loved, so if you aren't a fan you might want to stick to something else. The gyoza wasn't memorable, I know it wasn't bad but that is about all I remember. The shrimp I was not a fan of, it was small and under cooked, I haven't gotten it since. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the salad at rice trax's so I was really hoping that it was similar....it wasn't, it was watered down and lacked flavor.   Also, I have tried the chicken and the noodles. Chicken was great and there was something about the texture of the noodles that threw me off, however, my husband does love the noodles.   They have a great selection of sauces my favorite are the spicy teriyaki and the ginger sauce AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH the ginger sauce I wish they would bottle it's so AMAZING!!!!!!!  The prices are reasonable, it is always clean, there's never really a wait, service is on point, and the boxes they put the food in is cool they have the coolest lid that makes it so convenient when taking left overs to work the next day.   I knocked off a star because of consistency, last time I was there the steak didn't taste like it usually does. It was weird I tried my husbands and his was like normal but for whatever reason mine was not."}
{"text":"I came here for a family dinner! The food was tasty, but it was definitely a fast food Japanese style restaurant. It was hibachi style and I think it would be perfect for a quick lunch during a work break. The girl who took our order was really nice. If I come back, I'll try the dessert!"}
{"text":"I've heard so mush about bento boxes but hadn't tried them yet. I saw an advertisement for volcano grille. I just had to try it. I don't think I did it right. They mentioned sauces but I didn't try any of them. The food unadorned was really good. I'll come back sometime and try the many sauces."}
{"text":"I recommend ordering the Angus beef. And the beef alone is worth five stars however, The portions are small which can get pretty steep. I'm not sure why no one else has stressed the fact that this place is a pricier option compared to their nearby competitors. With that being said my husband and I are still addicted to eating here at least once or twice a week. We normally dine in and the place can get a bit warm inside especially when it's packed on busy days. The music playing is always an added bonus as well while dining in but the sticky tables can be a turn off.  I recommend going either before or after the lunch rush otherwise you'll find yourself standing in line for a very long time."}
{"text":"my husband and i have been here a few times. the first time it was good, the second time it was amazingly good, and the third time it was bleh at best. im hoping the 3rd time was just a fluke since the other 2 times were good."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start. The good, the bad, or the ugly so I guess I will simply start at the beginning....  We drove by this place by accident as my daughter learning to drive and was too nervous to cross a heavily trafficked road.  We ended up taking a right going through a business area and neatly tucked into the corner of a strip mall that can't get much foot traffic let alone car traffic was a place called the Volcano Grille.   The Bad is the location the Ugly is definitely the decor/ambience. Its barren at best. Hardly anything save the dangling lights hint at the Japanese culture this restaurant has at its core.  Its late March in Vegas, Its just starting to get warn outside yet this place was easily 90° inside. I'm hoping that was by design and a play on the name and not because the store doesn't get enough business to expense air conditioning. We did feel bad for the employees which leads me to the good.  Employees were nice, knowledgeable about the product and to make suggestions based on our orders. The food was plentiful and tasted amazing but we were disappointed with the lack of shrimp we received in our orders.   We ordered the large meals and received a total of four shrimp a piece. While that upset us the seasoning they had was killer. I could have eaten another 96 or so more.   The sauces they had were good but for a place called Volcano Grille you would expect a sauce called magna to blow the top of your head off. It barely scratched my throat. The other hot sauce they had did get my noise tingling and had great flavor but wasn't all that hot.  My Girlfriend thought their Hot Teriyaki sauce was the best she ever had and wanted me to see if they would sell us a bottle of it (they wouldn't but told me to take as many to-go containers as I wanted home with us).  Our price was shocking and deserves to be on the bad list as well. It was $35.00 and for that price you would expect a well rounded dining experience served on real plates not plastic throw always. If we go back we will definitely take another Yelpers suggestion and go to restaurant. com for a coupon.   We will also try another location just to see if the heat in the dinning area and poorly designed decor is a theme for this franchise."}
{"text":"First time around (about a year ago) the food was amazing. Lots of flavor. I just tried it again last weekend and it was a disappointment. No seasoning on the food, got home and realized they forgot part of my order, and it was pretty pricy for 2 bento boxes ($30)."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place. We try to come as often as we can even though it's on the other side of town from where we live but the drive is totally worth it. Everything is made fresh and their sauces are the perfect touch to every meal. My son loves their gyozas and I love their (extra garlic) shrimp and fried rice. Great food, customer service!"}
{"text":"Best lunch specials in the area, good healthy options and a nice variety of sauces to add some additional flavor to your meal!"}
{"text":"I have passed by Volcano Grille many times when driving on Durango, but never stopped in until recently. The day that I came here, it was very quiet. There were a few people eating their bentos outside and one other person inside the restaurant. I decided to get the Big Bento and did not realize that some of the proteins were extra charge. No big deal, but it was kind of expensive for average food. I wanted salmon and tofu, but the employee apologized and said that they were out of tofu. So I chose the beef instead, along with brown rice and spring rolls. I waited about 10 minutes for my to go order, but I didn't mind. I like how everything is made to order, unlike places like Panda Express where you never know how long the food has been sitting out.   My food was still hot and fresh when I got home. I really liked the beef. It was tasty, cooked well and delicious! The salmon was alright. I regret not taking home some of the sauces from their sauce bar, which probably would have made it better. However, another customer was taking his sweet time at the sauce bar the entire time I was waiting for my food. I think he took one of everything, LOL. The spring rolls were bland tasting and not recommended.   Overall, customer service was friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I didn't think the food was worth $16, although the beef was pretty good. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other options, but for the price, I can get better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wasn't too enthusiastic about this place as we drove into the barren shopping center.  They have those big stickers on the windows outside telling you about their specials.  These stickers usually mean that the restaurant is focusing more on money than the food.  I couldn't be more wrong about this assumption.  I ordered the bowl special, and I was really blown away by the quality of the food.  I ordered the steak.  They make everything to order from fresh meat, and it had a nice sear on it.  Instead of masking all the flavors of fresh veggies, rice, and meat with huge globs of gloopy teriyaki sauce, they use dashes of seasoning to really make all the fresh flavors pop.  I was EXTREMELY impressed by what they were able to do with a little chicken bowl.  They have a sauce bar, and I dipped my meat and veggies in 4 or 5 of the different sauces.  All of them were excellent and different.  I ended up combining 3 of the sauces and mixed it in with the rice.  It was wicked good.  In short, if your want fresh, fast, cheap, high quality Japanese food come here."}
{"text":"Really friendly waitress. I'm used to European style Japanese, we have a lot more \"sushi\" (especially boxes and conveyer belts) and tepenyaki is more of a sit down and long dinner experience. Somehow in USA-at least Las Vegas, bowls and boxes (IMHO fast food Japanese) had made it to market. I actually prefer how we have it in Europe as it feels more \"authentic\" that said Volcano Grille has managed to make it as good as it can be for \"fast food\" Japanese. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The ingredients are fresh, service is good, price is reasonable, and ambiance is fun! I love all the sauces to choose from to top your food with. I live that you can take sauce with you to go, I always find something at home to mix the sauce with. I wish I could buy it in bulk hHah! Yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"Reasonable price plus a healthy menu. I give this place a thumbs up. The salmon melts in your mouth plus the beef is oh so tender and when you mix the ginger sauce with the teriyaki sauce \"taste explosion of epic proportion\"."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! My boyfriend and I got 2 big bento boxes so we could try the Angus beef, chicken, shrimp, and salmon. All well equally great.  The place was clean and fresh. The sauce bar was super awesome. Staff was helpful with suggestions  since I hadn't been there. Over all great experience!"}
{"text":"Happy to see that one of my favorite Las Vegas places has opened back up. This is a locally owned Japanese teppanyaki sit in or take out place. I always get the Beef bowl (med rare) with brown rice and grilled veggies. They have 10 different dipping sauces to choose from. My favorites are the Hot Lava and Japanese salsa."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I made plans specifically to visit this Volcano Grill. I've been looking for a place worth visit for bento boxes and the only ones that really offers them are sushi places. So I was thrilled to see that there was a restaurant solely for bento.   A lot of features from this place seemed to be off-putting to me. For starters, the meals are so expensive for the mediocre flavor and portions. I felt they went on the cheaper side of things and hoped they take off from such dirty business.   First off, I ordered a regular bento box which included one protein and two sides. This comes with salad by the way. I got the salmon which costs extra, of course. As for my two sides, I got the Grilled rice which was basically fried rice and grilled vegetables. My salmon was cut in the shape of a fish which was creative but at the same time, I felt like it was off-putting. I'm trying to avoid the thought that I'm eating another animal so having reminded that it used to be a fish in the same shape kind of made me loss my appetite. At the same time, I thought about the scraps of fish that could've been on my plate instead of a cheesy-looking fish. The flavor was delicious but that was it. The portion of the rice along with the veges did not mix well. Also I got salad with it which was a bit of an overkill when it comes to veges.   My girlfriend got the bigger size of bento because she's a hungry hippo :P With the presentation, she was less than impressed. Three egg rolls badly placed on the plate so there was lots of room to play around with. The rice was a tad bit bland. And the chicken Katsu was not notable enough for another visit. For the price we paid for, I think we deserved some drinks along with it.   This isn't your regular sit down restaurant where someone waits on you. The food is ordered at the counter and deliver to your table. The service was average but friendly. Nonetheless, it was a nice try but nothing here won me over."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my husband one day and was surprised on how good the food was.   They have automatic sliding doors which is convenient if you're holding things in your hand. When you walk you go straight to the cashier to order and there's an area next to the cashier with a bunch of different sauces which I thought was cool.   I ordered the lunch special with yakiaona noodles, premium salmon which was $1.99 extra, and a spring roll (which was really an egg roll). Also, if you check in on Yelp you either get a free drink or some free gyoza.   Overall, I liked the food and the amount in the lunch special was good enough for me to finish the whole meal. I thought it was weird that there was no where to throw our trash away, but the cashier told us to leave our finished dishes there and she'd be the one to clean it later."}
