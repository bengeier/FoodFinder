{"text":"This coffee shop is so adorable! It recently opened, and I love heading in right after a workout at Orangetheory next door. The decor is dreamy and classy, and the shop is surprisingly large. I've had some of their pastries, and I find them well priced & delicious. The coffee is great too. It's a setting that's great for studying or for catching up with friends. Definitely worth a try if you are in the Kensington area!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their coffee. I had an Americano and it had little to no flavour. Won't be rushing back here when there's a bunch of other great coffee shops very close by."}
{"text":"My second visit here was not as good as the first. The coffee is still solid, carefully made espresso-based drinks, but there seems to be some confusion about pricing. There is one price for what I assume is the Godfather and another for \"single origin,\" but the espresso on offer was another blend, not \"single origin.\" If you're not selling single origin espresso and you literally do not know what the term \"single origin\" means, change the menu. That said, the espresso was fine.  I got the \"chicken parmigiana\" sandwich at it was DRY. Dry dry dry. It needed a marinara sauce and some peppers but it just had a pile of undressed arugula. Arugula is also dry and the overall impression was...dry. I went to the ever-present manager (and I agree with the other reviewer who found his constant presence in the seating area to be bizarre and a bit disturbing- if you're managing, get behind a counter and work, don't just hang out at a table and make the staff and customers feel as if they're being watched) and asked why the sandwich was so dry. He calls the chef, who tells me that do have a marinara and gave me a spoonful and it was good. Says something like \"next time you're here let me know and I'll make a chicken parm with sauce just for you.\" NO. You do not make this terrible dry sandwich and leave it up to one customer to fix it and only for that customer."}
{"text":"OMG! Calgary so needs this. Walking in the front door sets the stage for what will be an amazing place in Calgary. Beautiful couches and chairs offer a cozy feel amongst the tables. A couple of family style high tables run down the centre giving lots of variety to find that perfect spot. Food is amazing and the coffee delish. I had a latte this morning and no need to stand in line to wait, they deliver to you.   This place has a vibe all to its own and is a perfect spot for meeting friends and colleagues. If you want to work or study, this place is perfect.   I have met two clients there this week alone and this place has fast become my go to spot in the NW."}
{"text":"I have been to this newly opened cafe a handful of times and while I am really trying to like it, I feel there are some areas which need improvement.  The location is perfect, the decor is comfy and nicely decorated. There is a good variety of food and baked goods. I have not been overly enthused by their desserts (lacking flavour and sweetness) but do appreciate the macarons and croissants.   I find it uncomfortable how the owners are always sitting in the middle of the cafe looking at the patrons. While they try to be friendly and walk around and ask how things are, it has yet to feel genuine.   The bathrooms were particularly dirty on one occasion which took me by surprise. The cafe floors can look quite disgusting at times with food and crumbs not being regularly cleaned up.   As mentioned, I have continued to go back as I see great potential but am hoping that they can focus a little more on cleanliness and superior customer service."}
