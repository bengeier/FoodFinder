{"text":"I ordered a \"Cuban\" smoothie made with mango, banana, spinach, coconut milk and orange. I really liked that the smoothie was thick, smooth and creamy and not icy. It was a beautiful green from the spinach and, in terms of flavour, it was sweet (maybe from the banana) but not too sweet and had a slight citrus tang from the orange. Sadly, none of the other fruit came through. I was hoping for stronger coconut and mango flavour. It was a refreshing, healthy option on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Needed a juice but end up buying a bubble tea!  Yet another tiny little hidden spot in Brampton with a lot drink choices. The service was amazing and was greeted with welcoming smiles. Exploring and  Looking at the menu, finally went with the Rose bubble tea. The tea was decent but I was expecting a bit more rose taste then the milk.   The service was prompt. The atmosphere is quite good and comfortable. There are decent amount of seating. You will have to find parking on the street.   Would love to try their fresh jouice next time."}
{"text":"This will be my new to go hangout juice bar.  Excellent service, amazing juices and wrap options. Easy to find, free parking after 6pm. Staff super friendly. Great music and atmosphere. I had the cookies and cream milkshake (to die for) and my wife had the super green healthy option. Also free WIFI You must go."}
{"text":"Funny. Brampton didn't have a single natural juice place (Booster Juice doesn't count), then Fruision opened up on George St a few months ago. Last week, I was a bit surprised to hear of another one opening barely around the corner from it. That could be considered market over-saturation in even the most urban of centres, but for Brampton? Well, I just hope the city proves me wrong and can help both places thrive.  Trish Juice is a cute spot and wonderfully decorated. There was quite an expansive menu for varying types of juices and a few non-meat wraps. It has a downtown feel, without downtown prices since it's basically $6 for a medium and $7 for a large for most drinks. The value is that much more apparent when I received my medium which as a good size, made of purely freshly squeezed juice - no filler.  I went with the 'mojito' which is made of: cucumber, pear, lime and mint. Very refreshing and all-natural taste. I ordered a strawberry-banana smoothie for my wife which has a Greek yogurt base. She enjoyed it and I also had a taste. One critique of that would be that I could taste that the banana wasn't at its ripest. I'll keep the review at 5 stars since they've only just opened though. As mentioned, it is a pretty large menu, with over 25 drinks available, with even milkshakes included for those who want their sugar rush.  Lovely spot with so many great options and friendly staff. Sometimes it feels like we can't have good things in Brampton, but places like Trish Juice are proving that there is another way."}
{"text":"Cute little jewel of a spot in downtown Brampton . We were happy to visit this little place in the summer and have kept up our visits this winter. Had the Cuban smoothie and also just the regular banana shake and mango shake. So. Dang. Good. Fresh and healthy choices with lots of add ins you can totally customize your drink. Support local business and this place makes it easy!"}
{"text":"As a strong advocate of healthy eating, this is a great spot to visit in Brampton to get that healthy, great tasting smoothie. They have a variety of options, from 100% freshly squeezed juices to fresh smoothies. Something that sets it aside from alternative fresh smoothie locations in Brampton, are its smoothie bowls. I would definitely suggest checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter today for the first time and I was coming to try a healthier food option for dinner and I was presently surprised! This was a straight up 5 star place, they have a lot of different options to choose from and I tried the super kale smoothie bowl topped with chia, banana, strawberry, coconut and granola and my daughter had a energy smoothie which was strawberry, banana and Greek yogurt. It was amazing my daughter said an 11/10 smoothie and my bowl was excellent. The service was really friendly and it was a well decorated place. Definitely going back very soon."}
{"text":"Discovered this store while walking around Downtown Brampton during a sunny Sunday afternoon. I ordered the \"Trish Super Juice\" and it was honestly one of the best and refreshing drinks I've had. Whenever I'm in the area, I'm definitely stopping by this place again and ordering the same juice, it was that good. I highly recommend this place, the staff was very welcoming and nice, and everything is made fresh to order. I hope this place lasts and becomes a popular/known place in Brampton."}
{"text":"Finally a place downtown Brampton that has super healthy options! I got the Maple Apple salad with a side of the Avocado toast. Just delicious! Only downside is a lot of people go here now and there are only 2 ppl working so the wait was about a half hour during lunch time on a weekday. But, the wait was worth it. The food is fresh and the combination of flavours in the salad and even the toast was just perfection. Most importantly, the price is just right. Not too overpriced like most downtown restaurants. This is my new go-to place going forward."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe I haven't come sooner. When  working downtown Brampton, sometimes you're restricted on what you can get for a quick lunch. Although they're know for their smoothies, I was starving so I got their Pesto Hummus Wrap. I fell in love on the first bite. Healthy, flavourful, organic and so good. Your choice of wrap, with tomato, cucumber, onions, spinach, hummus, mozzarella and pesto. I can't wait to try out their smoothies, especially as the weather gets warmer."}
