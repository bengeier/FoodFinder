{"text":"Great tasting every time we go!! Never yet to receive bad service or food. Take a friend who ado loves Chinese too they will luv it!"}
{"text":"Ok meal. Ordered from here, Sweet and Sour chicken: chicken was dry, steamed dumplings tasted bad, sweet and sour soup disgusting, crab rangoon okay, the best part of my meal was the rice."}
{"text":"my favorite chinese place in the south hills. dining in is fantastic with huge portions. take out is fast and just as yummy."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for over 10 years I love their general tso chicken and chicken lo mein. I've also tried their sushi, it's good, but over priced. Love this placd"}
{"text":"We just found this Asian food restaurant and we are extremely pleased that we did!  I haven't been very adventurous yet sticking only to Chinese food but my guy has had their sushi, and Chinese, We both rave.   

The portions feed you for at least two meals."}
{"text":"It's quick and easy but not the best Chinese food.  Average and ordinary. 

The fact that they deliver is a plus."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I ordered from NDE.  It will be long time before I do again.  Szechuan Chicken that I ordered was fair at best - devoid of the spice that I expect from Szechuan.  My kids both ordered chicken fried rice.  It was horrible.  Trust me, these two are not too discerning when it comes to chicken fired rice, but they found NDE's to be barely edible.  They get two stars because they delivered quickly AND they offered to compensate me for the lousy food."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time, but it used to be a \"hole in the wall\" with just a couple of tables. It is now all sorts of fixed up and fancy, but don't let that intimidate you! They still serve the same great food at reasonable prices!

My favorites are the vegetable chow mein and the dried fried string beans. The entire menu is consistent and really very good."}
{"text":"Will return.  Lovely, clean, good food, good service.   Liked salad w ginger dressing. Crispy chicken and vegetables was nice portion w fresh vegetables.    Will avoid BYOB re corkage fee.   My friends recommend the sushi, including good price."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place more times than I care to admit. From the outside it doesn't appear to be anything special, when you walk inside it's a different story. The decor is more upscale than you would expect. 

The menu is extensive, I ordered California rolls and my sweetie ordered fried dumpling while we purused the menu. The California rolls were good, the fried dumplings were very good. It took us a while to decide what to have as our entre'. I chose pork egg foo young, my better half ordered General Tsao's chicken which was exceptional. The pricing was very good, better than other local chinese resturants in my opinion. We have yet to find an asian resturant in the Pittsburgh area that is better.

We really had a great dinner and will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"New Dragon Express is so yummy!  The Amazing chicken is amazing. The shrimp tempura rolls are delicious. We have ordered many different things off the menu and are happy with all of them. The waitress is always so friendly."}
{"text":"The sushi and sushi rolls are very delicious! It tastes fresh and a delightful combination of tastes for every pallet. The curry is also very tasty. The decor inside is modern and very clean. Clean lines and ambiance sets the tone. There is a sushi bar you can sit at as well, which is a nice touch. The staff are always friendly. They serve wine and beer but you can always bring your poem bottle, which is what this place had when they first opened. The corking fee is only $5. It's a great local place to try. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese, Thai, and Japanese food.  Love the decor and music, very relaxing.  We started with the Thai dumplings and then my gf had the Shezhuan chicken and I had the green curry.  Both were delicious and had just enough spice. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from there, and go all the time. Never had anything bad, except the shrimp with chili sauce, which was not terrible but not great. I would personally recommend the chicken with garlic sauce or the crispy chicken hunan style. Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Very good. Traveling through town and used yelp to find location. Modern, clean decor. Pleasant fast service. Food was prepared perfectly and was not too greasy. If I was a local I'd eat here regularly. Well done."}
{"text":"After our first choice of restaurant fell through (see my review for Sesame Inn), my husband and I found our way to New Dragon Express with the help of Yelp.  As soon as we entered here, we knew we would have a better experience.  The two people at the door greeted and smiled at us!  After being seated immediately and given lunch menus, our friendly server came to take our orders.  Hubs chose the Spicy Shrimp Hunan combo and I got the Spicy Chicken Hunan combo.  This includes rice, soup and, with a small extra charge, an egg roll.  
The restaurant started to fill up with other lunch goers.  Our food came quickly and both of us were happy with the results.  All and all, a much better experience than we had anticipated."}
{"text":"The food is always good and consistent. The only problem I have is when they mix up the rice in my delivery order (which is rare)."}
{"text":"Get take out from here at least once a week. The sushi is very good, and the egg rolls are great as well. They really have every Asian dish possible. The pad thai is wonderful and they give very large portions. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 was because they do (as many other sushi places) skimp out on higher quality ingredients and it's evident in the taste. Overall, probably the best Asian restaurant in the Bridgeville/South Fayette area."}
{"text":"New dragon Express has awesome service besides the foods. The servers are very friendly. And my fav
Is the tomato tree grown up of the concrete."}
{"text":"Better than Sesame Inn! I love this place.. me and my boyfriend try to go here at least once a month. Large portions."}
{"text":"I order food from there and have it delivered all the time, super fast delivery, nice drivers,  great sushi for being so close to home."}
{"text":"We order from here for lunch occasionally and the food is top notch.  I have also taken my wife there on a date night and the atmosphere is surprisingly nice for a strip mall restaurant.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Best Chinese food in the area for sure! You won't be disappointed. The service was very good too."}
{"text":"Great food great service always a clean friendly environment food is always fast and hot"}
{"text":"My Late Sister used to say\" If a Chinese Restaurant cant make a great EggRoll then they cant make their food right!\" True! If your trying 1 1st time order 1 EggRoll and if its bad pay it & leave.! And this place is disappointing! I ordered one to try it! Well upon cutting it open no shrimp and mushy lettuce like not cabbage and it tasted like Oil hasn't been changed in many years! So Unless the EggRoll for me isnt good I wont eat there! Trust me!"}
{"text":"Got delivery, wonton soup is bright yellow!! Beef Noodles was literally beef and noodles, no veggies! Fried rice was oily. Not authentic at all. Would not recommend if you are craving authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ate at the Sushi Bar and have had their take out. Always delicious. Best sushi in bridgeville."}
{"text":"Three of us ate at New Dragon for the first time. Overall, we liked this place a lot. The pork with bean sauce was very flavorful and better than the other nearby Chinese restaurant we have been frequently. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Decore and food are great! Would not think it from outside view. Treat yourself! It is such good food and generous potions for reasonable prices! Great Chinese Thai and Japanese selections. Food comes out fast!

We had the chicken pad Thai which came with tofu in the dish too. Very very good. Wonton soup was yummy. Moo Shu pork was good too. 


We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Kinda feels like I'm in Vegas.... Not sure why or how. I ordered the Amazing chicken, all white meat. Good. Nothing super about it, but came out fast & the service is on point . Waitress is very polite & friendly. 

Very clean- pretty much spotless. Bathrooms, floors, etc. I should be back to try their sushi."}
{"text":"Just went there. Had a few issues. 

1) were don't eat pork and my wife confirmed her rolls didn't have any. She took a bite and sure enough they did have pork. I had an inkling that the waitress didn't understand too much English. When she brought a teammate to confirm our questions, he mentioned there was pork in the product. The menu said it didn't as well.

2) the chicken provided to my wife was pink in the middle.

3) the tea, which is a standard for my wife there, tasted very bitter as if it was made earlier.

That was my wife's meal. My meal was average. The chicken tasted like it was frozen chicken that you would get from Sam's club.!other than that it was ok."}
{"text":"The interior of this place is awesome. I heard the story of the establishment thru the grapevine. Some flood destroyed and like Noah's Arc was rebuilt to be outstanding. the interior is contemporary and inviting with really awesome LED lights that set the mood. The food and service is great however i would suggest the waitress to reduce the frequency of trips she would make to my table. I barely had time to finish a bite before she would come back again and again and again. The General Tsao's Chicken is my standard and its the best I have had in the Western PA region. Each meal comes with your choice of soup/salad, spring roll and rice. The portions are like any other Chinese restaurant, large and good for two meals. Don't pass an opportunity to eat here because your stomach will hate you. 

Coming back here for my next chinese fix."}
{"text":"nice place, very good service. had the maki roll combo plate for lunch, miso soup and a ginger dressing salad - all very good. moderate pricing. will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is modern, clean, and well maintained. If there was a option for 2.5 stars, that would have been my rating.

We ordered 4 won-ton soups. Good flavor, but we all commented it should have been served hotter.

BBQ rib app was good, and big portion - thumbs up!  Served boneless...interesting...

Regarding the other reviews, (all 4 stars) my experience could have been judged as 4 stars for the overall look, cleanliness, etc. of the restaurant - but certainly not the food....or the attention to detail by the server on our visit.  Although the server was pleasant, menu knowledge was lacking, and I think he may have been a fill in employee.

      Entrees were just average. Lemon chicken seems to have had 2 previously frozen chicken breasts like you get in a package from Sams or Costco (that was the comment from my cousin...he really knows food). They were thin and flat looking..
      The sesame chicken, and orange beef portions were huge, the sauce was fine, but the meats were so thickly breaded that it really detracted  from the taste, and overall experience.
       
      I think we really gave this very nice looking restaurant every chance to \"wow\" us, but they fell short this time. Bill was $72 without tip - 3 adults, 1 child.  All meals were adult portions: 2 apps, 4 soups, 4 full meals, hot tea, one soda...no adult beverages. Therefore, pricing was average, not cheap as other reviews suggest.

      I think the overall experience was good, but the recipes (especially those that involve breaded and fried traditional dishes) need improvement."}
{"text":"Lunch is less than spectacular. It arrived on what looked like a child's plate with divided sections. Egg roll was bland, rice seemed to be pre-made and orange chicken seemed to have been frozen and then cooked on wok. Food came out so fast, almost as if it was already sitting in the kitchen. Wonton soup tasted like Lipton soup mix with one, soggy wonton. I will not be back. Keep driving!"}
{"text":"Food is about average for other Pittsburgh Chinese restaurants, Sushi I would say is below average as compared with local Japanese restaurants.  The major reason for the two star review however each and every time either myself or one of my neighbors has ordered from them they bungled even the simplest of orders.  Additionally, folks answering the telephone don't seem to have knowledge what's on their own menu. Ordering a simple item should not be met with confusion on the other end.

I've given into the trap of ordering from this place several times since I live so close, but I wouldn't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent. I always go for kung pao chicken and an egg roll. The egg rolls are absolutely fantastic!! The kung pao chicken is decent. The chicken itself is ok... I'm not a fan of how it's cut and prepared, but the sauce, peanuts, water chestnuts, and celery in the dish are great. Consistent, priced well, and convenient. I have been here multiple times and will continue to return."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday with a coworker. We called an order in for take-out so I can't comment on the service for dine-in. My coworker got two egg rolls and a seaweed salad while I got a veggie roll, sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, and wonton soup.

It's located in this little blip of shops and next door to a burger place. I walked in and it looked like the mood lighting was set at 12pm on a Friday. It smelled delicious and it was fairly full. Our order was ready for us so we paid and left. I'd totally eat in at some point because it was inviting.

My food was great and it came in perfectly portioned packaging. It was one container with a space for the chicken and another space for rice. It wasn't smooshed together or in separate packaging, which I loved. Wonton soup was basic. My chicken wasn't dry and the sweet & sour sauce wasn't overpowering. Ohh and the rice. So good! I also loved my veggie egg roll. They didn't skimp on giving us sauce and I liked that part too. I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese/Tai/Sushi restaurants in the south hills I've found yet. I also like a few others, but the strength of this restaurant is sauces that aren't too bland or too crazy, not soggy, attractive and decent sized portions, and a really unique and cool atmosphere with colored lighting and a lot of decorations. 

I love the recessed lights that change colors and thin window slats by the entrance, but if it's too much for you, eat outside. They have a big patio I'm eating at tonight, but I kinda miss the inside. You can often find the restaurant nearly empty, so it feels private and undiscovered. Today at 8pm on a Monday night, there's like three other customers, the most so far. Kinda funny, the music has a Latin flavor tonight... But it's a good lively background that doesn't call too much attention to itself nor too loud.

I enjoy their sushi platters and platters, a good variety of flavors made on-site. I'm not a sushi snob but I love to eat it... Rice used is very important, the sushi rices here have the right stickiness and not too mushy. The fish is nice not frozen, great even by itself as nigiri/sashimi.

The General Tso's Chicken and Orange Beef are unusually good. I'm having the Tso's tonight, and the chicken is fried crispy, the ruby red sauce is viscous and sweet (not very spicy, unless you eat the chili pepper!), with a nice garnish on the side of greens and a carved carrot flower.

We also usually get Lo Mein. Lo Mein is important to me, sometimes a restaurant will make it soggy or bland. The Veggie Lo Mein noodles at the New Dragon have a bit of flavor and are cooked just right, though the flavor soaks up into the mushrooms making them have a little salt and aren't dry mushrooms (fiancé loves them).

The Sweet and Sour Shrimp is one of my Fiancé's favorites in the city. She loves that they include pineapple, onions, green pepper, carrots... It just has more flavor. I find the sauce to be pretty light.

I have nice things and nothing bad to say about this restaurant, other than it takes 15 minutes to get here (no biggie) and sometimes I wish the menu had a picture of a monthly special or something to entice exploring the menu."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Crisp veggies. Meats tender. Sides great. Loved fried tofu. Service in house and delivery is precise and friendly. My new favorite Chinese and Thai after several times."}
{"text":"Thus far the best Chinese food I've had in the area! Food was fresh and well prepared and not over cooked cooked. I always judge by the Hot and Sour soup and this is some the best I've had anywhere in a along time. Nice decor, modern and not overdone. 
All this and the lunch menu pricing was a bargain. I'll definitely be back even tho I don't live too close....  I'd  pass at least for or five other Again and Chinese restaurants to drive here."}
{"text":"After moving to bridgeville 8 months ago, we had originally tried New Dragon and was not impressed at all. For whatever reason, we decided to give it another shot just a few weeks ago and I am so happy we did! Their food isn't overwhelmingly salty but still has a great flavor! They have fast delivery and are always friendly. Their portions are also quite large! One order of Lo Mein will feed me for a few days! Can't explain what the dislike was the first time but we love it now!"}
{"text":"I have only had delivery so I can't comment on the experience of eating at the restaurant. The delivery was always timely, the reason for the 3 stars is because anytime I have ordered food it is always very bland. The only reason I would continue to order is because they offer delivery, I would much rather drive down the road to a different restaurant if I was out and about."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this restaurant, I tried it.  I was disappointed.  The portions of entrees are good, but the food is mediocre.  Our chicken egg rolls were small, dry, and not very tasty.  My family style bean curd was presented mild as I requested it, but it was close to tasteless, in a bland, weak, watery sauce.  My favorite Chinese restaurant, Red Tea House in Mount Lebanon, is able to prepare a mild General Tso's tofu dish which is full of flavor and served in a rich sauce.  My lady's chicken with mixed vegetables was better, but not the best.  I would have been better off at nearby Sesame Inn for a few dollars more.  I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the burgh. Portions are huge, service is great. Can't miss place. Sushi is very good as well.  Very flavorful and lots of variety in their dishes."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from New Dragon for years! They have never let me down! My fiancé and I are within their delivery range now! Great for my taste buds! Bad for my waist! It's damn good food. 

My best friends own a Vietnamese restaurant. I'm a little bit of a food snob. Their Kung Pao Chicken (no celery, spicy 20/10) will feed you for days. Get the Thai Spring rolls too! Omgosh, Egg Foo Young too! 

Just order everything and have a buffet! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"My tastebuds are sooo happy right now. Beef lo mein lunch special with egg drop soup and egg roll...and a shrimp tempura roll. I have never had better Chinese food. Found this place by accident when I asked my husband to go have lunch with me. I will never go to a different place. I live in Robinson and I will drive out here again. Affordable!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon for $10 off $50, so we ordered shrimp egg rolls, shrimp tempura sushi rolls, shrimp & scallops Szechuan style, and chicken & shrimp taipei noodles. 

The egg roll skin was too thick for my liking. The sushi was also not great. The shrimp tempura batter was too thick making the sushi very heavy and unappealing. I had one piece and did not want any more of it and I am usually not that picky with sushi. 

The dinner portions are huge and more than enough for two people. The shrimp & scallops dish was not bad, a standard sauce flavor with broccoli, baby carrot, bell peppers, etc. The shrimp tapei noodles were very bland. I ended up combining it with the shrimp and scallops dish to give it some more flavor. Overall, a mediocre place for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"Terrible service. 3 other tables that were seated after us and ordered after us were served first. Our waitress told us we could not order soup even though it was listed as part of the entree. Other tables in the restaurant were eating soup already and were served soup later. When our food finally did come, it came in 3 waves over 15 minutes."}
