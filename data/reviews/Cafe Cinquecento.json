{"text":"went here for a last minute dinner option with friends.       not many reviews! so first off let's just make sure we're on the same page about the shitty ones.  \"...and I literally had to make eye contact with him to get him to come to our table...\" -Heather L     'i live in one of the biggest cities in canada but fuck me if i gotta talk to anybody' or 'my brain surgery went twice as fast as yours'  \"the cappucinos we ordered were gigantic and more like a cafe au lait\" - Jeremy V     'i need a laptop and a starbucks and a http://bit.ly/lLMESo '   \"at times delicious and others just fine\" - Diane R     'goddamn this is mediocre for the fourteenth time.' She gave it two stars.        but actually now. dope place, food was awesome, decor was to the point/legit italian/same thing, the owner was there making sure everyone was having a good time and king st w patio in the summer is well http://itsh.bo/jYqccO"}
{"text":"Unbelievably poor service - no matter how busy or empty the restaurant is they are understaffed. And the food is inconsistent, at times delicious and others just fine. I mean it's Italian and difficult to screw up. I'd say go the two blocks to Terroni instead."}
{"text":"Living in the King West area, I enjoy the selection of amazing restaurants and cafes that are literally on my doorstep. Cafe Cinquecento is not one of these restaurants. Its a shame really, as the location of the restaurant has so much potential.   My b/f and I decided to stop in on our way downtown on a Friday night. When we arrived, we stood at the front door for a few minutes before someone came over to seat us. Now, I can understand the wait if the restaurant was busy, but there were only 5 tables taken, and 2 wait staff working that night. After being seated, we again waited about 5 mins before the waiter came to ask if we'd like a drink. We ordered a glass of wine, and I had expected some water to be brought to our table. No water and another 5 mins to bring our wine. Our waiter was not very perceptive, and I literally had to make eye contact with him to get him to come to our table. Remember folks, 6 tables filled, and 2 wait staff working that night. I started to observe the waitress not serving us and decided that perhaps it was just our waiter that was slow. I don't think I need to go on about how SLOW our waiter was.   As for the food, we were not impressed either. We ordered two appetizers to start, mussels and a meat platter. They were ok. The meat platter, was meat, you can't really go wrong with sliced prosciutto and Serrano ham. The Mussels were good, I can't say they were bad but neither were they spectacular. For main dishes I ordered the special which was lobster with risotto stuffed peppers. My risotto tasted burnt. My b/f ordered the steak over risotto. I had expected either a full steak, or thinly sliced steak spread over a bed of risotto, however what came were slices of steak fried and dumped on top of the rice. We should have known when the waiter didn't ask how we liked our meat. The meat was overcooked and tough to chew.   Throughout the meal, it would appear they had some trouble in the kitchen as the restaurant filled up with smoke. No one thought to open the front door so we were sitting in it till we left and for the rest of the night we smelled like burnt meat.   Not an overall good first impression and the waiter was completely useless. I am not sure I will give this restaurant another chance. Id rather go to the Foggy Dew next door and have a pint with wings."}
{"text":"Nice little italian restaurant, the pastas were good.  The antipasto appetizer is a very nice size with a good assortment.  Service was a bit spotty - she was nice, but we waited a good 45 minutes for our main to arrive after apps.  And we were the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, food average at best, price was ok. I won't be rushing back  terrone's is far superior as are the views. All in all a big pass."}
{"text":"I have lived across the street from this place for over 2 years.  Never tried it.  Until last night, when I had a friend in town and we didn't want to wait outside in the cold for Terroni.  They had spinach and ricotta cannelloni on special, so we figured we should test it out. We ordered the cannelloni special, and the bacon and sweet potato ravioli in a basil cream sauce.  F*ing fantastic.   Both dishes were wonderful....and good sized portions that actually filled us up.  Also complimentary bread and oil.  The service was good, but not great.  They actually seemed overstaffed, and the guys were kind of goofing around on their IPhones.  But we got our food and drinks in good time, so I really can't complain.  The two dishes with pint of Mill St, and glass of red wine was about $45.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here was really tasty, fresh and good quality. We had 2 dealfind vouchers for $60 each and 5 of us went together.  We had pasta, salmon, salads, and pizzas. Everything tasted good. Now the reason for the 3 stars is because of the wait, I normally expect to spend 2 hours at a restaurant or more for 3 courses. We had appetizers and entrees at Cafe Cinquecento and it for 3 1/2 hours to complete the meal. Between appetizers (Came out almost 5-10 mins after ordering) and our entree was over an hour and a half.   if I was with my gfs and having wine I wouldn't have noticed as much but I wasn't I was with my dad, sis, her fiance, hubby and me. I was driving, as was my dad/ sister so no one ordered any drinks. We were so hungry we asked for multiple bread baskets :s  There service started off good, with the owner coming out and talking to us but that was because the restaurant was practically empty, it eventually filled to capacity. That's when our service disappeared, we had to flag waiters for more water and bread as we continued to wait.   by the time our entrees came no matter how great the food was we didn't really enjoy the rest of the meal due to our ravenous hunger. Everyone was itching to leave and was irritated.   So if a restaurant is going to take part in these online vouchers, please hire the staff to support the \"new customers\" you are hoping to become regulars.   I would go back for the food if I went with a few friends who had eaten a late lunch and we planned to hang out there the remainder of the night, I can see the darken ambiance being relaxing and fun to chat in.  Maybe better luck next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and both times have been disappointed. The first time, over a year ago, was a forgettable experience. The food was dull and could be confused with any run-of-the-mill Italian place that passes itself as authentic cuisine.  Last week we returned while walking by their beautiful patio. We were told that they don't allow people to sit on the patio and have a coffee unless they order food - this while the restaurant was 90% empty. We indulged them and ordered a tiramisu - big mistake.   Firstly, the cappucinos we ordered were gigantic and more like a cafe au lait. Unfortunately, whatever coffee they used was so miserably weak that it tasted more like drinking a bowl of warm milk. The tiramisu was an unending bowl of bland, flavourless calories. We left half of it behind.  The first time we went was a miss, the second time was atrocious. There won't be a third."}
{"text":"I've been blessed in my neighbourhood by a proximity to some really fantastic eateries all within crawling distance of my place.  So when a place opens up directly beneath your apartment, you've got to give it a go.  Cinquecento is Italian for '500' and is also the name of a car developed by Fiat.  I didn't know that either, but it makes sense when you see the automotive-themed awning out front on their patio.  A family run business to be sure, Cinquecento run daily specials that are so varied, fresh, and inviting, you find yourself wondering the purpose of the rest of the menu...which is also a great read and even better to taste.  Fresh ingredients abound, and freshly made pasta finds its way into every dish.  The wine list also supports the menu focussing obviously on the Italian wines, but has range into other vines.  The menu drives like an Italian restaurant should, bringing you through antipasto, salads, pastas, and secondi meals.  You're a fool to think that you can do all that AND leave room for dolci.  I will definitely suggest the Antipasto Misto for a start.  Totally fresh and tantalizing.  As for the rest of the meal, I leave that as a \"you-won't-be-disappointed\" exercise for the reader."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations several times and it is one my favourite neighbourhood spots.  I always get good service and the price is right.   My favourites are the pizzas and the Lila Salad (arugula).  Good wine.  Good atmosphere.  Good service.  Good times."}
