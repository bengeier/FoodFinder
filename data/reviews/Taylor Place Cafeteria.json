{"text":"I have been to Matt,s mean time and had good food but this time was not good in matter-of-fact it was of-full . The potatoes where undercook. The sausage was sliced but dried out and chewy. I just paid and left. I will go back someday."}
{"text":"A business lunch at a college cafeteria? I was a bit skeptical and then surprised.

The ambiance is nice with a modern contemporary feel. The salad bar is great it even had hummus and couscous. There is always a vegetarian soup and other option as well. They do have hot meal items too, on this day it was pizza, burgers, fries, a pasta with red sauce and cheese, and macaroni and cheese. 

There is also a wide array of drinks and deserts, some were novel to us, like a rice crispy treat made with trix, this is a diabetic coma served 2 cubic inches at a time. 

All of this for just $9.  and it is all you can eat.

Another pro is the calorie info posted by everything."}
{"text":"Breakfast: Four stars.
Lunch: Three stars.
Dinner: Two stars.

But really, if you're going to eat here, go eat breakfast here. They have delicious egg dishes and Sriracha. And you can preview the food before you swipe/pay for all-you-can-eat."}
