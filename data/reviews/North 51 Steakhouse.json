{"text":"This restaurant is in the Delta Hotel attached to the airport.  We've been several time now, and have had delicious meals each time, forgetting how good a steak house could be! Most recently we had the elk osso bucco and ricotta dumplings. Soooo meaty, with sour cherries. The lamb sous vide with risotto was super flavorful as well! The vegetable sides are nicely presented bundles: a little retro but so are the hearty, stick to your ribs portions."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Foodies will be in bliss! The chef actually prepared a crostini just for us and came out to see if we liked it! The meal was delicious, fresh and healthy. The humus was well seasoned and not oily. Health conscious diners will love this restaurant, the service was also excellent! Thank you:)"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here before a flight - and I mean REALLY great. It's a hotel restaurant so my expectations were low, but our waitress, Ivy, was wonderful, and the food was outstanding.   They buttered the toast for you (I felt like a kid again) and it was so good. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon was salty and delicious, and the fruit was really fresh. I think my plate was $18, which is kind of pricey, but a) it's a hotel so of course the prices are jacked up b) it was CAD so actually it was more like $16/$17 american dollars and c) my breakfast included coffee/tea and orange juice.   Overall, it made a flight delay not so bad and if I'm ever at the airport in Calgary again, I'll probably stop at North 51 to fuel up before I travel!"}
{"text":"They accommodated my dietary preferences by offering a dinner sized salad that was excellent."}
{"text":"We sat down at 9 pm, left at 11 pm despite posted closing time of 9:30 pm.  Roast beef was good, drinks and sides all quite good too.  I was pleased with quality of food given that it's an airport hotel.  Service was very obliging and fairly attentive... We were practically the only people there, however."}
{"text":"It's an airport hotel restaurant, so I didn't expect to be blown away by the service or food. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the breakfasts my girlfriend and I ordered here, however, and would definitely recommend it to any travelers at the Calgary airport in need of a quality meal.  We ordered OJ, coffee, and large breakfast plates consisting of eggs (any style), meat (multiple options), fruit, potatoes, and an option of white or brown toast. Everything was cooked perfectly and the sausage I ordered was very tasty (I'd normally expect hotel restaurant sausage to be pretty questionable)...  Our waitress, Ivy, was great as well.  A little expensive for breakfast, but I think the quality warranted the price."}
