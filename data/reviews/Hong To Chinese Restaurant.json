{"text":"I've been going there for years and the food is absolutely delicious. Good portions for cheap prices. I especially love the sweet and sour chicken and wonton soup."}
{"text":"I love Hong To! After experiencing less than thrilling Chinese food for months my boyfriend and I tried Hong To and we haven't gone anywhere else. Their fried rice is superb, it's exactly what you expect from fried rice (veggies, bean sprouts, eggs, etc) and I seriously dream about it at times. Their egg rolls are also amazing, so crispy and fresh even after the 15-20 minute drive home after I pick my food up. Their lemon chicken is a bit greasy, just a warning, but when you've had a long, bad day at work sometimes greasy is what you want. Definitely give Hong To a try!"}
{"text":"Chicken Almond Ding was fantastic, flavorful sauce, lots of bok choi (my fav) and water chestnuts, great veggie egg roll and wonton soup.  Have enough left for two more meals.  We got dinner for two - friend had Chicken Subgum Chow Mein and we shared both dishes.  BBQ ribs appetizer were great.  Waitress was attentive.  Definitely going back!!! Finally a local Chinese restaurant with REAL Chinese vegetables instead of just broccoli and peas and carrots.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We love the food. Portion size is enough for dinner and lunch the next day. I love the pepper steak and my husband gets the sweet and sour pork. We use take out but the restaurant is nice and quiet so I think we'll eat inside soon."}
{"text":"Walked in to worship music playing which I loved. Cute little place. Waitress was nice and inquired when I was due for my pregnancy! That was a first from a stranger. Tea was yummy. Wong tong soup delicious. Sweet n sour chicken great! Good prices and portions too! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants I've been too - fresh, reasonably-priced food with good service.  They just need to open a location in Mentor now!"}
{"text":"Ew. Got the family meal for two with Governor's chicken and pepper steak. Everything tasted like it was reheated. Definitely not cooked to order. Chicken breading was soggy, pepper steak was really tough and bland and the sauce on the ribs was weird and overly sweet.  The chicken wings were really fatty. Ever thing except the egg rolls was really gross. Never again."}
{"text":"Well I will start by saying have not ate here in oh 15 years. It use too be the cats meow ( no pun intended )   then kind of faded into just ok. Today since it was the only place close to our shopping area we decided to place a carryout order.  While picking up our order it looks well remodeled and very clean. When we got home i was pleasantly surprised at the quality & quantity the food was point on, the chicken was huge strips not little nuggets over battered and hard like most places these days, the shrimp chips fresh and crunchy not stale and finally the wonton soup perfect not watered down tasteless.  If you have not tried this place lately you might want too."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid! Always the best everything!!! Egg rolls, chicken chow main, wonton soup. Favorites all around!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. I was gonna give it a 2 bc the woman was friendly but the food is so bad that I can't give them more than a one. Considering I eat Asian food three times a week and love vegetables, I was mind boggled to be given a meal with not a single veggie. I order szechuan triple delight expecting chicken, beef, and shrimp. I got one scallop, and two meats that are so similar I can't tell if they are chicken, pork, or beef. It's all just in some nasty gravy looking sauce. I've never seen anything like it and it's horrible. The 'fried' rice is just brown rice. It's not fried. It has no egg, no onions, no other veggies most fried rice has. The egg roll was bland. And now I'm onto the hot and sour soup... it has no tofu  it's got pork in it. Never seen something like this ever and it's not good at all. No reason to take it back bc I wouldn't want anything from there ever again. Chalked up as a $20 loss."}
{"text":"My mom started taking me to Hong To way back when it was in the old shopping plaza - and while the location has changed, it is still my favorite Chinese food in the area for years.  From time to time you can tell when they switch recipes / vendors - but it has remained consistent and delicious! I do prefer Hong to for take out instead of dine in - Only because the atmosphere isn't my cup of tea.  The restaurant is nice and clean, but dim lighting and dated decor are not preferred over the comfort of my couch!"}
{"text":"I used to eat lunch here in the late 90's and it was quite good.  Between 2000-2010, I know for a fact they started using Mexicans as cooks.  Some of them bought parts from me.  Tonight I called and asked if they still used Mexicans as cooks.  They assured me not.  Part of great Chinese food is the chef's technique in the creation of the dishes.  I asked if the recipes were the same as the 90's and the lady said \"yes, same owner\".  We were excited to know this and placed a large order.  To get to the point, I've had Chinese cuisine from New York to Toronto to L.A., and this, without a doubt was the poorest excuse for the cuisine as I've ever had.  Their fried rice was way too salty and dry, the egg roll like a salt lick itself.  Lo mein was stuck together, tasteless dry mush.  The fried dumplings were over cooked and like chewing on leather.  The hot sour soup was like pure vinegar and super starchy.  We actually ended up throwing the whole order away.  Even the fried noodles were stale.  This restaurant just doesn't care anymore.  Save your money and stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Hong To is about as good as it gets.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the restaurant is deserted when we go there.  They do a  huge take out business.   The servings are huge, hot and reasonably priced.  This is not a chain which is a plus.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, was told 15 minutes. I waited in the restaurant for another 15 minutes to even get acknowledged.  Ordered wonton soup, no meat in the noodles. But  taste was good. Crab rangoons were very bland, onions too big. Went out on a limb and ordered the Hong to schezwan special and I was very pleased with it. But due to the blandness of the crab rangoons, I will not be ordering from this establishment again."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review. It's hard for me to give this rating to any restaurant, but it's also hard to find a restaurant that is this bad. Please save your money. This food was absolutely terrible. We ordered the sesame chicken (all white meat). The breading was almost like a hushpuppy, flavor wasn't great. Also got the szechaun chicken and cashew chicken. They were both bland.   The only good things were the fried rice and the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Slow and dirty!  Six of us went to dinner there Friday night Jan. 26th. My husband went to the bathroom and said it was the very dirty.  The containers on the table holding the sauces was so sticky and dirty we wrapped napkins around them.  This placed has really gone down hill over the years.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the War Sui Gai, wonton soup, chicken Lo Mein and Kung Bo Chicken. Overall - we felt most of the dishes were very bland. Wonton soup was pretty blah - very little flavor in the broth. The Kung Bo Chicken was even worse - absolutely no flavor and my husband didn't even finish it bc he was so unhappy w the flavor. We give 3 stars bc it was balanced out by the Lo mein and We Sui Gai which were both pretty decent. Lo Mein noodles a little mushy/over cooked tho. Overall - we would probably try somewhere else since Chinese restaurants are so frequent in the area."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had. Two people from our office ordered chicken, could not even eat it and threw it away. I don't eat meat, I ordered shrimp and lobster sauce, open the package and there was pork in it also. Will never go there again"}
{"text":"Quick service(take out) and great food.  We've been looking for a good Chinese takeout on the Eastside sine moving back a year and a half ago and this is the first one that we've had where we would order from again.   The best hot and sour soup we've both had in a very long time. And the beef is actually tender and tastes like beef. Super reasonably priced.  The only thing that would make this better is if their menu included pints and quarts. We're like to order Chinese take out family style it is eaiser and usually cheaper when ordering for 3 small kids  and 2 to 5 adults.  That is not worth a whole star knocked off but I can't only do half.   We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food, the two sauces I tried, sweet and sour and sesame, were very flavorful. The chicken was alittle greasy. One of the better Chinese places in the area, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good food. I especially love their chicken fried rice. Hong To's the only place I've been where the fried rice actually has the toasty complex flavor that comes from proper preparation, i.e. fried at high heat. Every other place I've ever visited makes this dish almost as an afterthought: steamed, mushy & tasteless. Portion size is good, service is cheerful and fast. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Fabulous deals. The portions are extremely generous and food is prepared so quickly yet maintains freshness.  The sweet and sour chicken along with the ribs and crab ragoon are always a classic!!"}
{"text":"When I give a full five stars to a business it's because the business offers a well-rounded experience to the customer. I've been eating here for many years and this restaurant is certainly worth high praise for it's value, service, and good food.  The aesthetics of the restaurant aren't anything to gush over, and it's located in the same place it's always been, in a small strip of shops on Willoughby's South side, but it's comfortable and the service is always prompt. The food is also served hot and plentiful, even for take-out orders."}
