{"text":"Cafe Maria has moved to 13560 N.94th Drive Suite N In The Plaza Del Rio Campus, just south of Thunderbird.  The new location is larger than the previous one.  The new menu is really great with prices affordable selections and pricing.  Their new phone number is 623-974-4702. It only takes one trip to the new location and like others you will return."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast today.  I had the western omlet and my husband had the SOS \"chip beef on toast\". My omlet was light and tasted fresh.  My husband said the SOS was as good as his old navy days. He enjoyed it. The coffee was hot, fresh but a bit weak.  But nothing on the breakfast menu was over 6.95. Pretty impressive!  Its good wholesome food at a great price. The bill for 2 of us was $14.00 before tip. I definitely will be back. The waitress was ok. Not too friendly but pleasant. That and the coffee is why I gave them a 4."}
{"text":"Advice:  don't buy a Restaurant.com coupon for Café Maria's - not a good deal!  Most give you twice the value of the voucher (pay $10 for $20 value).  There's was different; must spend $20 before the $10 discount, which cost $5.  Kind of deceptive but I should have read the small print as this is not the normal type voucher.  The breakfast was good - not large portions, nothing special.  Prices are fair but most likely will go to other cafes in Sun City."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and the service and food was very good. My wife loved her omelet.  I had pancakes and bacon that I washed down with good fresh coffee.  It was clean small and quick freindly service. You can tell these people want to please their customers.  We live in the area and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We were so hoping the next door Health Food store was associated with this cafe.  Came for Sunday lunch during an educational course located nearby, so options were limited.

Opened the door and received a potent blast of greasy meat smells that set me (omnivore) and my dining partner (vegetarian) running for the door.  To the patio seating.  Thank good they had a good spinach salad. Generous with sliced hard boiled egg.  Mine had one whole slice of well done bacon on top."}
{"text":"Best little cafe near Rio Vista community park! We stop here for breakfast after riding the trails just down the street. If you work out at the center or ride the many miles of trails at Rio Vista, this is a great place to stop and get a bite to eat, especially breakfast.

It's a small place tucked between the medical buildings in Sun City on 94th Drive just south of Thunderbird Blvd. Yes most of the clientele are seniors, so you know the prices are excellent! But the staff is always nice, the place is clean and the food is always good! Check hours, especially during the summer."}
{"text":"My daughter,granddaughter and I just had lunch at Cafe Maria's. It is located in a medical building complex. 
We were hungry and only had a few minutes before a doctor's appointment. We were in a hurry and was not expecting much. Were we surprise! Our waiter, Isreal was courteous, professional and engaging. I ordered the Shrimp  Louie. To die for!!! I usually judge a restaurant's quality be the freshness of the lettuce in the salad. Their's was crisp and very fresh. What an experience.. The entres were so good we found ourselves eating from each other's  plate.  What an incredible  find. I will be accompanying my daughter to her doctor's appointment for now on and I will leave extra time for Cafe Maria's"}
{"text":"What a great little place! It is family-owned and family-run. The staff is friendly and sociable and seemed to anticipate my every need (including setting up a highchair for my daughter). The menu is great. Lots of choices for health-conscious eaters and relaxed eaters alike. The food was very reasonably priced and was served very quickly. They've just moved to a new location that doesn't get a lot of business, so if you're looking for a great place for a great breakfast/lunch/brunch, go to Café Maria's!"}
{"text":"Good as usual, I usually like to try something new every visit to a restaurant, ,,but dam s.o.s is good 
 Hard to find anymore.
Service is great, very nice and a smile on their face :)
 You want down home cafe food, this is the place for you!  Small place, occupancy of 49 
For parents out there, this would be a good place for the kids, food comes pretty quick"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I only had a turkey sandwich but the turkey seemed fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly. My daughter had freach toast (witch Isreal Reccomend) and she tore it up. She is a very picky eater and won't even eat my freanch toast at home lol. I don't like it either but this place made it just right. The staff was also very kind. Thank you Isreal for a for a wonderful lunch experience."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews we thought we would give it a try. I ordered a half ham sandwhich with a salad. Large mistake could have bought better ham sandwhich at QT meat tasted old just a dab of mayo and a half slice of cheese. I asked about some lettuce or tomato on the salad and was told that is not how they make it. Luckly I did order a salad and had a little lettuce left over. Better half had the baked cod with clam chowder. Start with the clam chowder and it tasted just like the can it came out of had zero flavor to be honest it was not edible it was that bad. When the fish came out it was floating in grease with crackers on top. There was zero flavor in the fish when we asked about the seasonings we were told that is how we make it need to cater to the old people. Unfortunaly the wife is right now sitting on the toilet with food poisioning from the fish. Staff was rude almost impossible to get them to speak english food was of very cheap and poor quality and obviouslly the push on the fish was because it had turned bad. First time YELP has taken me in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden secrets for breakfast! Homemade gravy and the bacon are both cooked to perfection! Great food and personal service."}
{"text":"This place has Good food, Good prices comfortable atmosphere and Good Staff And people! Biscuits and gravy are good. Make sure of their Hours because they do change for the seasons!"}
{"text":"We tried this place because we had a Restaurant.com gift certificate. Servers were friendly and service was prompt. I was surprised that the cheese on my French Onion soup wasn't melted when served to me. I had Chicken Quesadilla that had a hamburger taste. My husband's Avocado-Bacon sandwich was good; generous with the bacon and French fries."}
{"text":"This is our first time dining at Cafe Maria.  Not bad, not at all bad.  Excellent service, reasonable prices and our food was tasty.  Menu had a great variety with many healthy choices.   Breakfast served all day.  Nice patrons that seem to be regulars, which is a good sign.   We will return."}
{"text":"This little place is right around the corner to my office. I previously had been here one other time and ordered a breakfast sandwich with a bagel instead of a croissant. It was good and I paid like $5.50. This morning I called ahead and when I went in to pick up the order the woman who was up front was rude to me. I was taken back by this because the previous visit was pleasant and it was with a younger lady. This time I had ordered the sandwich with avocado on the side. The total came to $8.00. Which is nonsense. I left thinking that I'd better have a whole darn avocado for the $3 extra I spent. When I arrived at work and opened up my box I found 4 small slices and a burnt bagel. I felt like I should let them know about my experience today because it really bummed me out. I normally don't complain but this was an exception. I called and spoke to the lady who sold me the sandwich and told her that I needed to make a complaint, that the bagel was burned and she began yelling at me! Lol! Telling me I was lying to her and that I can bring the sandwich back and she'd give me all my money back. I'm seriously blown away by how rude, over priced and unkind this establishment is. Please don't go here."}
{"text":"The Café Maria in its new location on 94th Blvd continues the local bistro type of fare that they have served for years.  We have been regulars for breakfast on weekends and lunch on occasion.  The owner and her family have run the place well for a number of years and reopened only 8 months ago after almost a year shut down due to construction and relocation problems.  The waitresses are mostly family members and the service and food are excellent.  The new location is slightly larger but still only seats about 50 with a few tables outside for overflow in cool weather.  The menu is varied, and they have tried Fri. night dinners, but stopped when demand dropped off.  They are mostly a breakfast/lunch kind of place, and are one of the nicest little hole-in-the-wall places where the regulars go to eat.  Hopefully business remains good in the new place.  They close in the summer on Sundays for breakfast, so we are stuck with other choices in the hot weather."}
{"text":"Too bad the Yelp address and map do not line up with the restaurant location (it's a residential brick wall).  There are several different addresses in fact when you Google it. Oh well. I was not about to drive around Sun City trying to find it. Ended up at an excellent Cafe 99 instead at 11001 99th."}
{"text":"I had seen the curbside sign several times as I went on my Wednesday morning deliveries so I set my schedule to stop here a couple of weeks ago.  This strip mall has been pretty quiet since Trader Joe's Moved a while back to a location in Surprise.

The menu is designed both in serving size and seasonings for the older crowd in Sun City.  I had a 2 egg Western omelet with ham, bell peppers and onions with toast.  The total with coffee, tax and tip came in around  $10.  There are daily specials even less.

Service was good.  Order, food and coffee were all taken care of quickly.  I gathered by the way the lone waitress interacted with the customers many of them were regulars.

This is a neighborhood type of restaurant open for breakfast and lunch only.  The hours are currently 7AM to 2 PM and listed on the window as summer hours.  These are hours normally associated with some place in a business district and I wonder if the winter hours include Saturday and or Sunday as Sun City is noted for a large percentage of the population to leave during the summer.  Some modifications have been made to the furniture to make it easier to clean; the tables have been covered over with Naugahyde  and the conference room style cloth chairs have been covered in a heavy clear plastic.

It's a OK place with acceptable food and service but I consider it a rather weak 3."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  It's always so nice and quiet and the service is amazing!  I love that the family all works there. We've only been there for breakfast on Sunday mornings. Food has always been great. I'm always sad when they don't open in the summer over the weekend, but always so happy when they open again."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast at Maria's for the first time and will absolutely return.  Open for breakfast through lunch, the food is simple and tasty. My burrito was stuffed with eggs, cheese & sausage, served with a medium spicy pico de gallo and fried diced potatoes. Our very friendly server kept up with coffee refills. The small  restaurant is surrounded by medical offices so is convenient for a quick meal before or after appointments."}
{"text":"We have moved our location is now 94th Dr. And thunderbird exact address is 13560 N. 94th Dr. Suite N Peoria, Az 85381 the medical 2 sign is right In front of our building come check us out still same great food and people, we're hoping to get all our regulars back as well as new costumes so come on and see us."}
