{"text":"Was not sure I was going to like it for some reason but my boyfriend convinced me to go.  Had the phillysteak and some chili fries.  I have to say it was the best philly steak sandwich I have ever had!  I can't wait to go back.  The meat is sooo delicious. It is a bit greasy but I did not care, just wanted to stuff my face!  Service was super nice and friendly.  Chili fries were good too.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I go here quite often after work for a quick dinner or for lunch with coworkers. I am from Chicago and this is as close to a Portillo's as you're going to get. Joey's of Chicago doesn't compare to Luke's of Chicago. I highly recommend.

They have homemade giardiniera hot peppers and quality beef. I normally get the Italian Beef sandwich with the giardiniera hot peppers. You can also buy a jar of the hot peppers for a reasonable price. If you're looking for a quick, high quality beef sandwich in the valley, you'll find it at Luke's of Chicago."}
{"text":"DOWNHILL.  I've been eating at Luke's a few times a month since 1996.  Over the last few years, It's slowly been going downhill.  Their signature Italian Beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold.  The extremely hard crusted french bread used to be dipped in au ju (gravy) to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor.  Now, no matter how you order it (extra gravy, wet, etc.) the sandwich comes out almost completely dry and is guaranteed to destroy the roof of your mouth.

I'm really disappointed to see a restaurant I've had so many good lunches wither away, but even their health inspections have made dining here risky at best.  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=11712&business=LUKE'S%20RESTAURANT&address=1602%20%20%20E%20%20INDIAN%20SCHOOL%20RD&permitid=SG13198

All this and their prices have been skyrocketing!  Save your money and your health and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best Italian beef Phoenix has to offer, heck, it may be  best sandwich in all if Arizona..and I have tried many. Get it \"wet\"with cheese peppers and extra gravy..the only place you might find a better one is in chi-town itself...You NEED to bring one to Arrowhead area!!!! Please!!!!"}
{"text":"Luke's is highly recommended. The place is clean and the food is good!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I'm not too familiar with Chicago cuisine other than a deep dish pizza so I didn't exactly know what to expect when walking into this authenticate shop off 16th st and Indian School. The guys here were saying pop instead of soda so I guess I can call it authentic... I ordered the Italian beef with cheese and onion rings. The Italian beef had very very little cheese but had a kick to it. It was juicy so it was hard to eat. The onion rings were fresh and crispy. My friend got the cheese fries which were better than what I ordered and I'm not even a nacho cheese fan. I'll try it again but next time I'm grabbing a bratwurst with fries. They have a pizza puff that sounds interesting as well. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Luke's from my youth in Tucson, where they provided a nearby source of yummu chicago dogs and bigger-than-average burgers.   Let's be honest, the burgers are decent but unremarkable.  They are, at least, consistent in their mediocrity.  Luke's can't hold a candle to Delux or the Sonora Brewery, but they are definitely cheaper, likely closer and they've a down-home feel.

The customer service was fantastic and incredibly friendly.  I definitely felt very welcome and the atmosphere was warm, even if they muttered about my Red Sox stomping the White Sox on the t.v. and changed it because they couldn't bear to watch.

hah!"}
{"text":"I agree  with the comments stating that Luke's has been in a downslide over the past few years.  Also,  Health Inspection Reports are  not good......... Read the specific violations to get your gross-out for the day. www.maricopa.gov - restaurant inspections)
I am still searching for the ultimate Italian Beef sandwich.  Can anyone help (er, \"Yelp\" ) me?"}
{"text":"One of my Fav places.  I have been going there for years. but i always order the same thing....Italian beef. the wife will get a chicago dog or a maxwell street.  Im from outside of chicago and my wife grew up downtown.  When we get the craving for that neighborhood type food we will hit Lukes.  its almost as good.  not quite there. but is close.  Why cant Mr Beef on Orleans ave open a phx location?  But lukes does well filling the craving when needed.  

I completely understand the comments on the service.  We have been going there for years and they have always been nice to us. but seen some people get some cold reactions. Oddly they remind me of 2 brothers who owned a deli where i grew up.  Its kind of like the soup Nazi from Seinfield. Know your  order or donot go up to the counter.  dont ask stupid questions about menu items, order clearly and quickly.  pay and sit and wait. the food will be brought out fairly fast. lol.

When i get that back home craving for some artery clogging italian beef and wonderfully greasy fries. Lukes is the go to place. and a reminder that if i lived in chicago i would probably weigh about 400lbs."}
{"text":"I read other peoples reviews and it bothers me. Every place has good and not so good reviews and that is fine. But, in my opinion and my opinion only, unless you have worked the front and the back of the house, only then you can judge the attitude of a restaurant. I as a customer have bad attitude too some times. Not every day I am all smiles and high spirits. My cousin owned restaurants in this town and I have periodically worked there. Maybe is me, but I don't go to Luke's for their cleaned toilet, I have that in my office. I go there for their great food. I don't worry that the area is not great. I called south Phoenix home for many years. It is nothing wrong with 16th street and Indian School. There are better restaurants in worse areas of this town. Luke's  roast beef with all the extras is the best I ever had. Support the little guy, the local restaurant. Yes, the big boys can build bigger and better places, but personally I don't go to a place for the decorations on the wall. I go there for their food. And I review based on how good their food is."}
{"text":"A coworker took me here and I can't get enough. Whenever I am in the vicinity I make my way over for the Italian beef with sweet and hot peppers. This italian beef is juicy on a big soaking piece of Italian bread...mmmmmm. You can also buy it by the pound for party events."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and KNOW real italian beef w/peppers,etc. The sandwich was good, but pricey. THIS is my real BEEF: I stood at the counter for five, yes five, hungry minutes before anybody took my simple order. Seems they were too busy (it was 3:30 pm) to bother with me. For the money, I would expect better service."}
{"text":"5 is not enough stars.
I'm a vegetarian, and off the menu, there is a grilled veggie subsandwich, that's Hot!
superb value, excellent authentic taste with natural ingredients.
this is the place to be.
excellent service, great location, perfect food!!
:-)"}
{"text":"What a wonderfull place.Great food ,great service ,great over all place. 
 I wish they  had extra parking ."}
{"text":"I love Luke's! This location is the best by far. I've been to others and for some reason the food here is always better. The Italian Beef (hot, sweet, and juicey) is amazing. The fries are amazing. The hot dogs are pretty dang good too, but the hot dog itself could be a little better. Not sure which brand they use, but that would be my only minor complaint. Not that the hot dogs aren't enjoyable because they absolutely are...heck, I eat them all the time! I'm just saying that I've had other Vienna Beef hot dogs that tasted a bit better. Maybe they're boiled instead of grilled? Overall though, you can't go wrong. I'm a big fan! Keep up the good work and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh not great and not terrible... It's just I've had much better combo sandwiches at Half Moon Windy City and Portillos."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed lunch at Luke's just  about every Saturday since we met in 2008. She introduced me to Italian beef and is a native of Chicago. We first visited one of the two in Tucson and then alternated between the three -now one left--in the Phoenix area. We normally split an Italian beef; extra beef, cheese, sweet peppers, dipped; two extra crispy fries and an order of their homemade, batter dipped, onion rings. The food is awesome and I've had many of the items on the menu. The down side is the service. Now, I don't need the staff to be all happy and smiley but politeness and customer oriented I do expect. The owner and employees seem to be bothered by customers coming in to order food. A son of the owner of the Phoenix area restaurant(s) ran a place in Chandler, it was very nice and consistently packed with a  steady flow of customers and pleasantries from the staff. Not sure why papa didn't want junior to succeed, especially when his old man and brother own the two in Tucson. Seems you would want this to keep going with the family and be proud of a the legacy.  Anyway the Chandler store was closed without a word to the steady customer they knew by name and order. Then the same thing happened to the Scottsdale location. Showed up one Saturday and the place is empty and up for lease.
 
So, for food the rating would get all 5 stars from me, but the service leaves a bad taste in my mouth - pun intended. Still we come back every other week and search frantically for a quality Italian beef elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you like traditional Chicago style Italian Beef, Italian Sausage or Chicago style hot dogs, Luke's is the best place in metro Phoenix.  Their beef and sausage is superior to Portlllo's.  Love the fries as well be sure to order them extra crispy"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Luke's for some time now. I am not from Chicago so I can't offer any feedback on authenticity but it is usually pretty good. 

I am not sure what's up with the owner. I assume him to be the salt and pepper haired guy who appears to be in charge. No one working there seems happy and like many other reviewers have already said the fat dark hair man working the counter is a business killer. I would have to guess he is driving off 10s of customers a day minimum. The owner is either blind or just doesn't care because the rude treatment goes on when he is right there. 

Time for Luke to thrown in the towel or make some big changes.  Start by firing the rude #%ck at the counter."}
{"text":"Luke's has the best Italian beef I've ever had.  I've been going here for almost 20 years (geez, I'm getting old!) and it's always great quality, piping hot and spicy hot if you get it with the hot pepper mix --which is uniformly HOT.  I love this stuff.  Jalapenos, celery and other veggies pickled into atomic flavor bombs.  If you don't like hot jalapenos, you may want to pick another topping option.  The beef is always tender and I've never had a gristly or fatty piece.  The bread is good stuff--they get it from a local bakery and it's perfect.  The fries are crinkly cut and yummy --if they cook them long enough (hate it when the fries aren't crisp --and these can be soggy if they pull them out of the fryer too soon).  They have diet RC on tap and unlike other places, they have a good syrup to soda proportion instead of cheaping out so it tastes like soda should--not just like fizzy Phoenix tap water.

The sandwiches might seem a little pricey compared to other places, but they're totally worth it --and if you read my other reviews, you know that I have a very sensitive price to value ratio, so that's high praise coming from me."}
{"text":"I had an excellent roast beef sandwich, with indifferent but fast service. Prices for toppings were high. The restroom was locked and the TV was tuned to the offensive Fox News channel. I go occasionally because the food is quite good, but the experience could be improved with minimal effort and no expense."}
{"text":"Grew up in Chicagoland and Luke's takes me back!  Bread is the secret and they have it right, great combo!"}
{"text":"I have not been here for couple of years as I moved away and i used to love going here at least once a week, since it was the closest place to the original Chicago Beef.  I have to start looking for a new place. Sorry guys.  You had the BEST what happened??"}
{"text":"I was a long time customer and left the area ten years ago. I decided to make the trip into town on two different occasions this past month for Italian beef, and their quality and freshness became so much better late in the afternoon. I was so sorry I took out early on my second trip to get there for opening at 11am for an early lunch. It was only then that I realized that all of the leftover slow-cooked beef had to be reheated in order to be used up first; this also included a heavy dose of salt!

Their Italian Beef becomes dry and tasteless from their morning prep method compared with their fresh product later in the day, high in sodium.

I would not trust this company for its catering service or buy their Italian beef by the pound for these very reasons."}
{"text":"Well cashier was nice. Red sauce amazing. Potato chips with expired date from a  month or more ago. Dirty both place and bathroom on the worst part of town. Food grade for Chicago barely  average. One of the cooks just chastised the other gentleman who tried to have a great positive attitude jovial even.
Similar to segragated Chicago the customer base was unfriendly to those who did not look like them. Read into this what you would like. Since we are Health Care Professionals and deal with the public we just ignored them ate our food had a great time and smiled at them on the way out.
Go to Portillo's stay away from here not really worth it except you may want to get the red sauce for your sandwiches at Portillo's that's about it. 1 star for the red sauce that's all."}
{"text":"Heard through friends that this is the place to go for good ol' Chicago food.  I'm from Chicago so I'm kind of an expert. :) At first, we were not impressed.  We arrived about 20 minutes after they opened and we did not even see an employee for 10 minutes. He was running a 1 man show and cooking up the order that was ahead of us. He finally took our order with no apology for the wait but let me tell you, the food was worth the wait. I had the pepper and egg sandwich, Amazing!!!  My boyfriend had a chili dog and fries which he said was really good!  We'll definitely go back, hopefully the service will be better. I have a feeling that his co-worker was late and that was the problem, still not an excuse though."}
{"text":"The food is good, truly Chicago style, where I'm from, but now live in Phx area. If they would lower their prices by X%, their business would increase by 2X%. I, for example, come in very rarely because the prices are ridiculous. Ten bucks for hotdog, tamale, small drink - come on! It also would help their cause if they had drive-thru service."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a couple times, and never disappointed.The beef sandwich and fries are very good and quick, definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Just OK for me.  Not welcoming at all,  first time here for the family and I, not even greeted with a hello? ! The cashier seemed miserable,  another gentleman took our order and seemed more personable.  I will not be coming back,  I'd like to think that places like this appreciate new business."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices. Only drawback is that often there are large Gypsy familys eating there. Very noisy, messy and disrespectful to the establishment and other patrons. Cary the owner understands the meaning of customer service and is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Luke's has been around as long as I can remember- at least since my first visit in the early 1990's. The food is consistent superb.  The service is friendly, personal and exactly what I want from a family owned business. Chicago Dog, Sausage or my favorite the Beef with extra Luke's homemade giardiniera, ya can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I had their Italian beef sandwich.  It had a nice kick to it.  Fries were excellent. They had green river soda!!"}
{"text":"I was really craving Italian Beef. Yes, yes. That's what she said. 

They didn't disappoint. Fast service, great au jus. And their fries are great, since I like them the way I like my dollar bills: crinkled. Only down side is that the hot peppers barely registered one alarm. Hotter!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I found out this place was right down from where I lived, that was short lived.  I ordered the Italian Beef.  I know there are a couple of places that make you pay extra for sweet peppers and giardiniera, so this didn't upset me too much, but the attitude of the cashier did and the fact that I paid the extra and did not get them did.  I got my food to go so I didn't realize the missing peppers until I got home. Also, it was the driest Italian beef I have ever eaten.  With other places nearby that you can get a really good Italian Beef sandwich, that cost a lot less, I'm not sure why this place always seems to be busy. 
    Now in their defense, I never complained about the mistake, so they never got the chance to fix it..  Also, maybe the cashier was having a bad day, it happens.  The overall experience has kept me from going back. Other friends have told me they don't like their Italian Beef, but that they do have good dogs."}
{"text":"Horrible service went there and spent almost 30.00 on food and left hungry. Small portions and the owner/cashier was very unfriendly and acted like he was doing us a favorite by eating there. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I went in with a group of people and we shared everything. Italian beefs, Polish and Bratwurst were great. There may be a line, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago hot dogs and beef!  Totally miss the Chandler location and don't get to Phoenix as often as I'd like.  I've had many things on the menu over the years.  Definitely worth a stop when you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Apparently until today, I didn't know how much I had been missing the Chicago style cheesy beef.  Based on how quickly I inhaled Luke's cheesy beef at lunch, I have greatly missed having cheesy beef in my life.  

Bonus points awarded for Luke's carrying the ubiquitous and something I always found strange to sell (although all cheesy beef joints in Chicago sell them) the pizza puff and the tamale's."}
{"text":"2 words...Italian Beef

Parking sucks. Prices are high. Lines can be long. Coca-Cola only in cans (RC Cola on tap)...but the Italian Beef...

No where else can you get a sandwich like this...not even Chicago.

Order it wet (they soak the Vienna roll), get your favorite peppers...add a small order of fries, a can of Coke and that is $10 and you are happy all day."}
{"text":"I can't believe I found this Luke's here! Finally real Chicago dogs and atmosphere. You already know what to expect with a hot dog but the celery salt and fixings make it that much better! Great place! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food is way too greasy I got the Italian sub combo idk if that how they make it in Chicago but it was really gross"}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally.  Great food, reasonably priced.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Here is what you should have for lunch - Italian sausage with sweet peppers, hot peppers, and cheese. Throw in a order of fries plus a RC cola. 

Love it."}
{"text":"Great Hot dogs, Italian beef and Italian sausage.  When ever I'm in the neighborhood I stop in for my Chicago \"fix\"."}
{"text":"Best root beer in the valley. Maxwell Street Polish is the best! Family owned. Great and eclectic decor. Perfect for lunch. Right next to a comic shop. What more could a girl want?!"}
{"text":"ate there awhile back and will not be back. food was terrible and way overpriced. they used to have the best food around. no more. and the owner is a real jerk. very rude and uncaring. no wonder the scottsdale and chanler stores closed. this one is next. mark my words. the food is exact opposite of chicago food. what happened?"}
{"text":"I look forward to perusing their menu, but consistently ordering the polish sausage with everything on it- tomatoes, peppers, onions, and celery-salted pickle. It's GOOD, juicy, and the bun is basically overpowered by the sausage. Best thing is the \"SNAP!\" when you bite into the immensely caloric greatness. 

I should run a marathon and head over there now."}
{"text":"In my quest for the best Italian Beef sandwich in Phoenix, I took the advice of a friend from Chicago and tried Lukes.  I must say that it was very good.  The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because of the peppers, and giardinieri.  The meat was excellent, as was the bun.  If I was rating the sandwich strictly based on that I would have give it 5 stars.  The au jus was fantastic as well.  And they dipped it perfectly.  It was soggy like it should be, but I could still pick it up and eat it.  The only issue I had was the peppers and giardinieri.  I get mine with both hot and sweet peppers.  The giardiniera lacked something.  For one thing there was not enough of it on the sandwich so it was missing that spicy kick.  The sweet peppers were not cut up, so it was just one big roasted red and green pepper.  Slicing it up smaller helps when eating the sandwich.

The only other issue I had was the price.  After adding both peppers, small fries, and a small coke, my bill came to $12.40.  That's about 4-5 dollars more than I pay for the same thing at other places."}
{"text":"Had the beef sandwich, hot tamale and chili cheese fries.  The beef sandwich was dripping in au jus and was really good.  It was my first time eating a hot tamale...meh.  Chili cheese fries...how can you screw those up right?  So yes this is a good spot.  Would definitely return if I lived in Phoenix.  The two guys behind the counter were a little less than friendly, but it was late in the evening and so I'll give them a pass"}
{"text":"Holy crap.  I can't believe I'm saying this but their Italian Beef is better than the Chicago Hamburger Company, and if you are a west sider, then I'll tell you it is better than Fuzzy's of Chicago also.  

That is a seriously strong statement and I am shaking my head in disbelief while writing it, just like I was shaking my head in disbelief while eating it.

Did I say holy crap!?  HOLY CRAP its good.

The beef is wonderfully tender and juicy.  So juicy in fact they don't even serve it with au jus, but they do have it on hand if requested.  I recommend you ask for a side.  Save some for me though!

My only very minor statement is that I like the hot pepper mix at my other two spots better, but the beef...  OH the BEEF makes up for this tiny shortcoming.

I can't wait to go back.... and back... and back."}
{"text":"Last night we were charged extra for cheese & peppers, got home and they wern't there. Size seems to have shrunk since previous visits also."}
{"text":"haven't been here in a few years I remember it being a lot better maybe cuz I go to a different Italian beef spot now Newk's bread sing a little stell the meat was a little tough and hot peppers and hot at all way too much oil I think that's what people are saying that is greasy I think it's the peppers didn't really have any flavor at all to the sandwich the girl at the counter wasn't very friendly either little pricey for what you're getting I probably won't go back again"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since I often drive by. I was very disappointed. The beer battered zucchini rings were over salted. The meatball sub was over priced ($9) and lackluster. It was unsatisfying and lacked flavor. The Italian beef sandwich had good beef but was very dry. I will not return."}
{"text":"There is nothing Italian about the BLAND, DRY taste of their so-called Italian beef and sausage. Despite charging a fortune for their sandwiches, they give you 3 little slices of pepper and if you want more, or even a bit of au jus to moisten their dry beef, they charge you 75 cents for a \"side\" in a little cup! And they don't even make grilled onions! You'd have to be a native Arizonan to think this is really Italian! And the girl who works behind the counter is very distracted."}
{"text":"Chicago style is exactly what I expected. Wish id tried the italian beef in hopes it would exceed expectations"}
{"text":"I've gone two times-that will be probably be it.  The first time I ordered the italian beef/italian sausage combo.  It was decent-nothing spectacular.  It was around $7.00-no fries.  The next time I went, I got the double hot dog.  It was around $5.50 and came with fries-great I thought...until I tasted it.  One of the hot dogs tasted funny- I  looked and it was still very red inside-they had not cooked it enough and it was raw....ew!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Italian beef sandwiches for over fifty years. I'm from Chicago. The best beef is fresh cooked, sliced and sits in Italian spices all day. If you want fancy and new go to Portillos, but the beef sandwich won't compare to Luke's. Yes it isn't a fancy place and it is a little drive, but if you want the very best Italian Beef sandwich this side of the Mississippi, Luke's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I had nothing to compare this to because I've never tried a Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich or Chicago Style Italian Sausage.  I heard of Portillo's from my Chicago friends here in AZ and it's apparently a favorite but I have yet to try it.  I have not heard anything at all about Luke's from my Chicago friends which I thought was strange.  I decided to try Luke's because it was fairly close to my house and every time I drive by I always saw a nice amount of cars outside of the establishment. 

I looked over the limited menu and decided on an Italian Beef Sandwich which was thinly sliced roast beef on what should have been a crisp baguette with roasted bell peppers, giardiniera hot peppers and provolone cheese. The flavor was A-OK, nothing to brag about.  The bread was SUPER soggy, wet soggy, unenjoyable soggy.  The meat was salty. I had to eat my sandwich with a fork because the bread was literally mush.  It old my friends that are Chicago natives about my experience and they said you should have told them not to dip it too long or too much.  Who knew? Because of this I won't try the Italian Beef sandwich again.  That was enough! I would like to try the Italian Sausage because I love Italian Sausages from just about everywhere."}
{"text":"I had Luke's last night and must say it was pretty good. Being from Chicago I always frequent places in the valley that advertise being a Chicago Style. This place can say it is a Chicago Style. 

Dripping Beef Sandwiches, Polish Sausages and homemade peppers pretty much makes up the menu and that is what makes it Chicago Style. A simple menu with good meat and peppers on it. It has a hole in the wall authentic feel but it is a very clean place. 

I would definitely eat here again for a good beef sandwich with Mozzarella."}
{"text":"This place is a valley staple. Truly the best of Chicago! The Italian beef dip with cheese and pepper, juicy is the best on the menu. Crinkle fries are perfect and not greasy. The customer service is stellar. Seriously best family owned food joint in The Valley. Also you really cannot deny anything else on the menu either.  All delish. Excellent prices."}
{"text":"I love the meatball sandwich the best so far, but everything I have eaten is been really good."}
{"text":"so I finally decided to come back to Lukes. I had been several years ago, but never made it back. I went for the Italian beef and sausage combo sandwich with provolone and sweet peppers.  It set me back just over $9.00. A tad pricey, but it was a pretty good sandwich. The bread was very fresh and the beef seemed to be very well seasoned. it also came with a cup of Jus, that it definitely needed. I'll def go back if I'm ever in the mood for an Italian beef sandwich, but I'd prob skip the sausage next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I get the Chicago dog each time with everything on it! The guys in the back always have a smile on their face and it's truly authentic. I come here alone all the time for lunch and I feel right at home. Nice people and great food!"}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty but synthetic once your Chicago meal arrives and your first question rolls off your tongue asking this is all there is? The charbroiled taste does redeem the initial sticker shock of your lunch order however the ingredients can't cost all that much. I know plenty of mom and pop places that can deliver great taste, authenticity and value. My question is why settle for two out of three?"}
{"text":"LOVE Luke's!! Amazing juicy italain beef. Just like Chicago. Even the peppers are fantastic. Love the hot ones. Service is fast. Bread is good. Fry's are perfect. Every now and again they have amazing brownies to die for. I also love that they have ginger ale and RC cola. I would eat here more if it cost less. Easy 30 bucks between 2 people."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Prices were high. Beef no cheese or peppers is now $7.50! Beef was cold and not dipped as I requested. Flavor was ok, but maybe thats because I'm now spoiled by Portillos. Fries are great. I wont be back for a beef but would for a hot dog."}
{"text":"If you're in this area of town Luke's of Chicago is the best place for Italian beef and Chicago style hotdogs. Just like the original in the city of Chicago."}
{"text":"Coronary heart disease is usually caused by a condition called eating at Lukes, which occurs when you eat greasy material at Lukes and a substance called plaque build up on the walls of your arteries. 

Lukes serves overpriced and over greased Chicago grub. The food was so greasy my bun turned into a sludgy doughy mess. I went with a couple of coworkers who also resonated the same criticism. I wont go back to Lukes and you shouldn't either if you value your heart."}
{"text":"Their Italian Beef is made in house and in my opinion is way, way better than Portillo's. The bread is pretty good as well. It holds up under the juice.

They have tasty sweet peppers and a very flavorful yet not too hot giardiniera.

Their Italian Sausage is tasty as well.

I usually get a beef or combo dipped with sweet and a side of hot as well as extra juice with a side of well done fries. 

Let the beef drip on the fires and poor more juice on the fries. Put half the hot on the sandwich and the rest on the fries.

Then any beef pieces that fall off on the fries and have some beefy hot juicy fries. 

The polish are good as well. 

Not a fan of the dogs but that's because I'm a natural casing kind of guy. If you are ok with a no casing Vienna beef dog then you will be ok with the dogs.

They also have your standard Chicago tamale and pizza puffs.

I would eat there a few times a week if I lived closer. 

This is a real Chicago beef and it's not packed in Chicago and shipped frozen to Phoenix. 

You can tell it's real and homemade because sometimes it's OK, much of the time it's pretty good and other times it's fantastic.

My favorite beef is Al's on Taylor if you need a baseline for my tastebuds. 

In Chicago Portillo's wouldn't even be on my list. There are far too many neighborhood beef stands to go to Portillo's in Chicago. 

In Phoenix Lukes is by far my first choice. And it's family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Always love a good Chicago Dog and Luke's is a cool place to scarf down a couple. This location has been here for a long time and you can tell. The outside is a bit weathered with a very small eating area inside.

Been coming here on and off since I moved out here. The menu has the typical Chicago favorites with the service and attitude that make you feel right at home. Giggles! 

Usually order one of the famous Chi-Dogs or maybe an Italian Beef with both sweet and hot peppers. The french fries here are your typical frozen crinkle cut kind and nothing special. Wish they had handcut. They are so much tastier and can be found in other Chi-town hole in the wall places around town.

There are so many new Chicago restaurants in the PHX area now and some of them big chains. Luke's has lost their edge over the years. The quality of the food and the service is not as good as it was in the past and the prices keep going up. Maybe I'm just getting spoiled in my old age.

Everyone has a different opinion of this place and the only way to find out is to give them a try. The parking lot is somewhat limited and a bit tricky at times. This place can definitely get really busy during peak eating hours. So get ready for a bunch of impatiant hungry people. ORDER UP!

{"text":"I think Luke's is just so-so.  
A group of us Chicago transplants at the office made the trek to Luke's for a nice Friday lunch.  I did the combo sandwich and I was a bit surprised that for the price fries did not accompany the sandwich.  The giardinera (sp?!?!) was also nothing like I was used to, and frankly disappointing.  It was a bit greasy too.
IMHO, Chicago Gyros does a much better job."}
{"text":"There beef sandwich taste bad has a tap water chlorine taste to it last time i would eat here onlt took a bite pf the sandwich and it was pure junk"}
{"text":"I was at home watching a show about  Chicago style hot dogs and Sandwiches, It  got my stomach growling. I googled and found Lukes. I had the sausage and roast beef sandwich loaded with their gardenia toppings. They do not skimp on meat and the roll they use is so good. It was one of the best sandwiches ever! I have gone several more times before I hit a Football game at ASU. Very small parking lot, can take out or eat in. Very small place, but well worth trying. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Luke's for the first time last evening, and I am kicking myself for not having gone sooner.  Just a couple of blocks from my house, I must have driven by this gem a thousand of times in the last four years, OHH!.  During my short wait, I really got the Chicago thing, just standing there soaking in all of the memorabilia, a photo of a young handsome Ditka with perfect hair, the city skyline, actual metal municipal signage, White Sox this, Cubbies that.  They really  hit the mark here, and I don't even like Chicago (Go Orioles!).  When it is your turn to order, you better spit it out, no hemming and haawing, this is like a real city in here, time is a premium, and the people behind you in line and the guy taking your order won't appreciate that drawn out, indecisive manner that is so prevalent in Phoenix and Denver.  I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich plain, this was the acid test, kind of like ordering fish and chips in an English or Irish pub.  I also ordered a Beef and sausage Combo with hot peppers and provolone.  A large order of fries and two sides of  complimentary \"gravy' to go with the sandwiches. The gravy is actually an au jus, and it is so delicious.  I recommend getting it in a container, and not poured all over the sandwich, especially if it is a to-go order.  The hot peppers are pretty hot, I think they were raw jalepenos, so no need to elaborate.  The plain beef sandwich was such a pleasant surprise, the bread was fresh and soft, the meat was juicy, flavorful and plentiful.  It is good all by itself and even better when dipped in the gravy.  The Combo beef and sausage with cheese and hot peppers was also fantastic.  I love Italian sausage and though this was not the absolute best I've ever tasted, I really appreciated that it did not have an overpowering fennel seed flavor.  The fries are fat crinkle cut and they were served very hot, crispy, and light golden in color.  Fries can be such a disappointment if undercooked, so if you like them well done and browner than gold, you might want to pass.  I love Luke's, and i hope they will be in my neighborhood for a very long time."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Best beef and hot dog joint in town  Much better then Portillo's
Portillo's has lines to get in and Luke's has a steady flow but nothing compared to Portillo's 
The old saying \"sell the sizzle not the steak\" is what makes Portillo's so popular and they do it in every city they expand to.  When I'm back in Chicago I hit Gene & Jude's but don't even think about going to Johnnies as you can't get a better beef then Luke's  Luke's hot dogs are best in town too"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here as I have enjoyed their food over the past five years. I work nearby and used to recommend this place to new employees and students on rotations at my job site.
The food has remained pretty consistent over the years but the customer service has fallen way below satisfactory. There are a couple of employees that seem pleased to help you as you place your order but the older man who has been there lately is just not friendly. I have tolerated it lately as I've enjoyed the food over the years but today was the last day I'll go back. 
He is rude, unwelcoming and does not understand basic customer service.  Today, after standing in line with six others, he took the orders of the five individuals in front of me. As soon as he took that fifth order he walked around from behind the counter as if I wasn't even there in plain view, walked past me and proceeded to pick up trash off the floor, wipe some tables down, then walked past me once again, never acknowledging me, to grab the trash bin and baskets.
As he approaches the counter once again, I ask if he is going to take my order and he says, \"do you not see I'm doing something?\"  I ask again what he said in case I heard him incorrectly and he repeats himself asking if I did not see him doing something then proceeds to tell me I am rude. I say you clearly don't want my business and I left. 
This is no way to treat a loyal customer of five years with many referrals to your business. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food. The owner is a great guy. We got there at 8pm and he had just turned off the sign but he still took our order. The food came out pretty fast but it was not rushed at all. I had the Chicago dog and my friend had the Italian beef. We were both please with our choices I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"I just wish there was a Luke's in Flagstaff!  Try the Combo, beef and sausage, that requires a roll of paper towels to mop up the drippings.  It is so good.  And the Italian sub is bravo delicious!  

The place is tiny and crowded, but it's places like this where stuff of legend comes from.  Amazing sandwiches.  Have always encountered friendly staff with quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian beef sandwich with gardinaire. Great tasting, moist and flavorful. Will be on my regular rotation of lunch spots."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor! I only make it here about once or twice a year. I order so much food and it home for later. Obviously, not the same but I still enjoy every bit of it! 
Italian beef w/sweet peppers & giardinera on the side."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on a bad day but I wasn't so wowed about the Italian beef. Plus it was very expensive, spent about 27.00 for two Italian Beef sandwiches, one thing of chilli cheese fries and two drinks. The Italian beef seemed as if it was made half assed, it was just a hoagie bread ( super thick) stuffed with shredded Italian beef that was a bit bland. 
You guys can find a better place and cheaper. Too overpriced"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for a long time - and I've been to Luke's sporadically over the years. No good reason I don't go regularly - the food is always exactly what I expect and the prices are fair.
I seem to stick with the Italian beef - but the menu also covers hot dogs, hamburgers, subs and Italian Sausage. (I will have to try sausage, peppers and onions with red sauce at some point - one of my ultimate comfort foods- to see if they're as good as Guido's in Scottsdale.)
The beef is juicy, shaved thin - and works perfectly with the giardinera and hoagie roll. 

For those nights when I just need a mouthful of hot meat, Luke is my go-to guy! So happy I can satiate the craving right around the corner from home!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we eat here!  Had the sausage, peppers & egg sandwich today - delish!"}
{"text":"This place is trouble.. delicious, delicious trouble. 

\"Chicago-style\" and \"Chin-dribbling-fatness\" can pretty much be used interchangeably when describing food. Either you get it or you don't. I won't try to convince anyone.  

Personally, I recommend the Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella and sweet and hot peppers in lieu of the signature Chicago-dog. Any hack who has had one can emulate the Chicago Hot Dog, but it takes a special touch to get the Italian Beef sammich just right. Luke's does. 
 
Don't take a date there. Don't expect comfy seating and a cozy atmosphere. You may wait a long time in line. You may wait a long time for your food. You may ingest 2300 calories in a single sitting. Your circulatory system may temporarily shut down upon completion of your meal.  If any of these things are a concern for you, please go elsewhere. For those of you who remain undaunted, check it out."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not from Chicago. My family is however, and I've brought them here before and they all were impressed with Luke's. 

Here's the deal. I became addicted to Luke's back when I worked at their other location (now defunct) in Scottsdale many years ago as a teenager. The beef sandwiches were all awesome, and the sweet peppers were my favorite. 

At this location, I stop in for a combo (beef and sausage) with cheese and sweet peppers. I then finish my order off with a Hires root beer and a large fries and I am in heaven. It really is the best beef in Phoenix. 

The ambiance of the place screams Chicago, like many others have noted on Yelp. The service also screams Chicago, in the sense that the service isn't friendly. On my last visit, the guy had literally nothing to say to me and he took my order at the pace of a snail. 

It is what it is. Authentic. In a good and bad way. Can't have one without the other. 

Yes, Luke's will get my money on occasion. It will remain that way."}
{"text":"I think I am not the right person to be writing a review of a hot dog restaurant ir I just should have had my favorite-a chili cheese dog.  Otherwise, the service was pleasant and fast.   The restaurant was clean.  The hot dog was okay.  I did think the onions on it could have been grilled longer.  If you are a hot dog lover, you will be able to determine things better than I can."}
{"text":"The beef and sausage here is great! The staff always seems to have a stick up their ass... Buy working without A/C all day will do that."}
{"text":"Most definitely improved. Eating lunch, It's a delicious \"wet\" fully loaded Italian Beef. My only \"beef\" is the price of $7.50 or $5.50 (jr. size), does not come with toppings. If you want hot, sweet peppers or cheese it's $.70 each. The junior ran me $8.35 with the works. Crazy, for these prices toppings should be included. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and got a Polish dog. Very nice. Fries are great too, just how I like them. However, a suggestion: PLEASE include at least one diet soda in your machine? Pretty please? kthxbai"}
{"text":"Best Chicago style Italian beef & Italian sub. Delicious meat & great quality bread. Fries are good too & portions are huge. The hot dogs are traditional Chicago style too. I've been coming here over 10 years & has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"I love this place. i got hooked on the polish for a while. The wife said try something else, so I then got hooked on the italian beef. Next step, the combo, italian beef and sausage. I'll probably never try anything else from there, because throw in the peppers on the side and that is my idea of a perfect sandwich. Just too much food. The wife and go through periods where we drive down there from the west valley every weekend. My wife and several of our friends are from Chicago and they'd put this place right up there with the best in Chicago. This place beats Portillo's hands down, nice local spot instead of the big chain feel you get from Portillo's. I probably should give it a bad review to keep it from becoming over crowded. LOL."}
{"text":"There is no doubt about it, Luke's on Indian School does Chicago-style beefs very accurately. In Chicago, good little dives like this are everywhere, but out in Phoenix, the few that try to delivery the same flavors of the windy city usually fall short. 

I can only speak for the Italian beef for now, but it was great! I walked up to the counter, and without hesitation, said, \"Beef, dry, with extra giardiniera and au jus on the side.\" Needless to say, the guy behind the counter and I had a moment; he understood me and didn't need to follow up with any questions. When the food came out (it took a little longer than expected, but the cook kindly apologized fot the wait) my taste buds got excited. It was loaded with giardiniera! I've found that a lot of places are stingy with that delicious condiment, but not here. I asked for extra, and by golly, I got extra. One unique thing about the giardiniera was that it seemed fresh, like really fresh, and there were jalapenos in it! Yes! This little touch took that beef over the top. I put that sammich down and didn't leave a trace.

Luke's has won me over for when I'm craving some delicious guilt-full Chicago staples. It's not as good as a plane ticket back home to dine, but it's not bad at all.

PRO TIP: I understand the complaint with soggy sandwiches, so if you don't want it like that (dipped), ask for it dry, and ask for any peppers on the side. That should help keep your sandwich intact."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent if you like Italian beef order that and have them put some mozzarella cheese on it and have them double dip it it is messy but fantastic everything is good there"}
{"text":"Not so good 
Food is fair 
Owner is nuts 
How has this place has stayed open is a miracle at best.
I mean if you're driving down the street looking for this place will probably drive right by it.
Cuz the signs are never lit up and you can't read them at all I'm sure they're going out of business soon if they haven't already.
No thanks"}
{"text":"Great Italian beef and good fries. The cheesy fries are meal in themselves. I usually stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Italian beef sand. Near the airport. It's their own recipe not Scala beef. Just okay. Two older gents take orders and make the food. Kinda in a not so good area. Place is run down but I was just getting take out. 

Prob won't return. I'm from Chicago and it's not on par."}
{"text":"Great italian beef although their arent as many peppers as i would like so be sure to ask for extra. However, i am a fan of this place."}
{"text":"These guys make a pretty decent Italian beef sandwich - not my all-time favorite, but a little better than average. I ordered beef with cheese, dipped, and was pretty happy with it. The bread maybe wasn't cut quite enough, so I got that kind of sandwich where half the bites are just bread - but it was cooked pretty well, and was dripping with meat juice.

The fries were ok - never been a huge fan of the thick crinkle-cut fries, but they were cooked right. The RC in the fountain was something different, so that's always nice."}
{"text":"Very good beefs!!! Hot dogs are good too but wasn't a big fan of the chilli dogs. Awesome fries very good place definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I love Luke's.  I have been coming here for 22 years.  The hot dogs are great, the polish dog is the best my husband has ever had and the pizza puff....YUM.  It is certainly not health food, but for the occasional cheat meal....it hits the spot.  I read some of the other reviews, and as far as it being in a bad part of town...it is FINE during the day. Luke's was here before it was a bad part of town.  The staff....yeah, not so friendly but what do you expect from teenagers?"}
{"text":"Ive been going to Lukes for about 10 years and the food has always been good, but the service and staffs attitude have really gone down hill. im glad they are doing well enough that they can treat customers with a \"i'll get to you when i can\" i called to place a to go order, was barked at to \"hold on\".
They never bothered to come back to the phone for 12 minutes! i hung up and called another restaurant.
If you're looking for a really good Italian Beef go to Postinos,. Great food and they are happy to serve you! Or Spinatos  on Bell."}
{"text":"Came here a while back with the SO, couldn't decide what I wanted fast enough, and the older woman (owner?) behind the counter became increasingly annoyed and nasty with me. (fwiw, we were the only people in there at the time.)  Ended up getting nothing. SO got a hot dog (not that impressive, but not bad) and fries with cheese. The fries are the reason I'm giving my rating 2 stars instead of 1. 

This place could be as amazing as others claim, but the service left a LOT to be desired."}
{"text":"I have just recently discovered Luke's and mmmmmmm I am addicted! The best Italian sandwich EVER!!! I ordered the whole because I was starving, but was defeated halfway. I put the half in the fridge for lunch the next day and it still was amazing! Small menu but it is definitely worth it! ps... fries are really good too! om nom nom nom"}
{"text":"If you love beef and/or sausage sandwiches, this is the place.  Awesome flavor, HUGE portions, and greasy goodness.  All the locations are older, simple, and who cares.  You're there for the food, not the ambiance."}
{"text":"A Phoenix favorite and must stop every time I am in town. Great food with Chicago flavor!"}
{"text":"I'm basing this on the owners lack of appreciation for his customers.  My buddy and I used to live in Tempe where there was a guy on University who made the best italian beef Chicago style.  Unfortunately, it is no longer there.  Since moving to Phoenix, we can't find a good one.  This one came very close, but the owners attitude sucks.

Furthermore, the guy charges 70 cents per topping which puts the normal toppings at 2.80 on top of the 8 dollars and change for the sandwich.  23 bucks for 2 of them.  This guy is crazy for charging such a price.  He definitely lost some business from us, especially considering we used to go 1-2 times a week at the last place.  

The nail in the coffin was when my buddy said good bye on the way out and he just looked at us.  Unbelievable that you treat your patrons like that!  I'd rather give my business to someone else."}
{"text":"From Chicago and of course my favorite sandwich is an Italian beef. This place is better than Portillos and can stand up proud to Al's. Fun Chicago memorabilia. Little pricey for beefs and fries."}
{"text":"My poor Arizonian babies...  I'm not sure if Luke is from Chicago or not, but this is not Chicago styled food.  

I just moved to Phoenix from the Windy City in January and I had a hankering for an Italian Beef sandwich.  I started to try out Rosati's which is closer to where I live, but decided I'd yelp first to see what options I had.  Luke's was one of the more popular recommendations.  I stopped by this evening and there was a group of ladies in front of me.  I took a moment to look at the menu, but I already knew what I wanted- mostly just filling the time until the guy at the counter was ready to take my order.  As the girls took to their seats, I was expecting the guy to greet me or ask me what I was having. Not everyone's big on small talk.  I get it.  Welp, the guy walked past me and avoided eye contact, heading into the back.  I waited at the counter, and he came back out within seconds... And walked right past me again.  He was apparently getting some cups for the ladies who were in line before me.  A simple \"I'll be with you in a minute\" would do.  None offered.  So I finally place my order and give the guy my credit card.  He swipes it and sits it on the counter and walks into the back again.  I wasn't sure if he'd actually collected the payment or what, so I left it there.  He comes back out and is shuffling around a bit, finally noticing that my card is still on the counter, then asks me if it's mine.  Then he remembers that I still need to sign off on the receipt.  I get my food, and leave.  Bad service, I'm hoping the food at least makes up for it.  

When I get home, I can't wait to dig into my Italian Beef.  Oh boy!  It was dry and the beef tasted like it had been re-cooked.  People, I'm from Chicago.  You can get this quality of Italian Beef from any hole-in-the-wall place in the city.  Thing is, it'll be about $4.  If you want a better quality sandwich, you'll probably go to an Al's beef location and spend about $6.  For $7.20 here, this place is ripping you off."}
{"text":"I've been going to Luke's in Chicagoland since the 70's. I happened to be in the area and thought I hit it for lunch. The place was mobbed, I got the last parking spot (sweet). I ordered an Italian Sausage sandwich with red sauce, small fries and a regular drink for $10.23. Finally, a place claiming to be a Chicago place that actually knew what red sauce was. 

The Italian Sausage was grilled and delicious and about 12 inches long on a perfectly fitted bun (now I know why lunch was over $10). The fries were crunchy and good as well. I recommend the Polish Sausage sandwich and beef sandwich as well, had those a couple weeks ago."}
{"text":"Foods always good and the staff is straight forward which I like cuz it makes me feel like being back in Chi. 

Recommendation: Italian Beef w/ provolone & Sweet peppers. Asked for it to be dipped."}
{"text":"Tasty but vastly overpriced Italian Beef on One Star Bread that does not meet Chicago standards.  Unresponsive, largely absent staff during slow hours. Dirty dining room. View of Indian School road. Hoped for an improvement but appears this owner has a core clientele and therefore does not care to improve his restaurant.but no Health Inspector would sanction his dirty restaurant.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant every time I am in town.  The beef and sausage combo with provolone cheese and hot peppers is the best around.  I like mine nice and soaked with lots of beef broth.  The meat is seasoned perfectly.  Cary ( the owner) likes to season the meat for days prior to serving.  It's worth it.

  The owners greets me every time I come in and Desiree never ceases to offer the best service!  

Take a jar of hot peppers home!"}
{"text":"My daughter a friend and I happened to be going by Luke's today and had heard it was good. The person that waited on us was crabby and didn't have a smile on his face. I had the Chicago dog, it was okay but the hot dog was not very hot. The fries were lukewarm. We won't be going back there again. I would not recommend it to anyone. Better dogs at Costco."}
{"text":"I just arrived from Chicago and was looking for a taste of home. I order a Maxwell street polish with everything. The young lady gave me a over cooked polish with green peppers not hot peppers. It was wet and slimy worse ever."}
{"text":"I so badly want a Chicago style Italian beef joint near my house - and though I live just a few blocks away  - Luke's of Chicago is not it. 

I've been here twice - each time brimming with optimism at the hope of getting an approximation of the real deal.  Both times I was treated to hard, stale bread, bland meat, flavorless jus, burnt greasy fries.

I am sure my craving will return at some point - and because LOC is the closest thing in the area, I am sure I will be tempted.  I am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time."}
{"text":"First time to Luke's, and I'm no connesuir of things Chicago, but I left fairly un-impressed. While in line I was told by a fellow luncher that the Italian beef was the way to go so I went with his suggestion plus sweet peppers and provolone. The food was good, not great. The bread was probably the best part and there was more than plenty of it to eat. The peppers and beef were fairly flavorless in my opinion. I wasn't disappointed but I won't be hurrying back either."}
{"text":"Let me put it this way: my doctor would give Luke's one star. 

Put another way: one meal at Luke's costs approximately one year off your life span. 

And despite that, I love this place. Thankfully I have enough self-control to avoid going more than a couple times a year, which was greatly aided by my move from a downtown firm to Scottsdale. A bunch of my coworkers, all male of course, would get cravings for this joint and despite our better judgment head down and scarf down our fill of the most delicious, greasy Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages you can imagine. One of my friends was from Chicago and he has certified its Chicagoness. 

A female friend once wanted to join us, as we were headed out one day. She asked if they served salads. We must have laughed for ten minutes straight. 

If you're allergic to the Chicago Cubs, stay far away. The decor will kill you, assuming your choked arteries from eating here don't first.

EDIT: In case I didn't make it clear, and without getting Lukes into trouble with the EEOC or something... I really can't imagine a girl coming here and actually liking it. Any girl who does would probably scare me, a lot. So, while I'm sorry that Patti B's experience here was \"awful\" (lol!), that pretty much confirms that Patti is in fact a normal gal."}
{"text":"I discovered Lukes on Stone and Ft. Lowell while I was at U of A in Tucson. It was a pleasant surprise when I learned that there are Lukes in Phoenix too! For those who are from the land of the hot dog, like Chicago, I'm sure nothing compares, but for an Arizona Chicago style hot-dog, it's pretty darn good!! If you're craving a hot dog without going to a BBQ or a baseball game, stop by Lukes and fulfill it there. It's authentic, juicy and tasty. The fries are good too! In my opinion, you just can't go wrong with Lukes. Why not check it out and let us know what you think!"}
{"text":"Ambience: Typical family-owed fast food lunch stop. Definitely has some Chicago neighborhood character to it. Patrons mixed from white to blue collars. Decorated with some classic Chicago flare (I appreciated the stolen CTA bus stop signs hung on the walls)

Food: the Italian beef sandwiches with sweet peppers are just as good as back in Chicago. definitely better than Romano's. I'll be going here for all my Chicago food fixes.

Service: Some reviewers have mentioned rude service but I did not experience that on my visit. Besides its a Chicago Fast Food joint, I don't expect brown-nosing, in fact a little curt service makes me feel like I'm back in the Chicago neighborhood  joints."}
{"text":"Probably a prime example of a guilty pleasure! Some of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted! Really quality sandwiches at this small corner gem! Crazy pepper choices!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Their Italian Beef is out of this world! All of their food is good, but the Italian Beef... outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The big guy over there is the best! Great beef sandwich. So much better than portillos. To the people that don't understand the Chicago attitude lighten up a little bit"}
{"text":"It's one of my top go-to places for Chicago-style hot dogs. (Remember, kids - there are *seven* condiments, and not a single one of them is ketchup! ^_^; )

A Chicago dog and fries are always a great deal, and it's nice to see a place that has RC Cola and related brands on tap. (Something you don't see every day, but then there's a good distributor in the area, so I hear.)

Parking around the place is somewhat limited, but it's all in timing your visits. I've yet to be there when the place is packed. Luck of the draw, I guess.

When I hear that folks from Illinois (Whether visiting, or relocated) stop by, then that clinches the deal there. (I'm an ex [or \"exiled\"] Californian, but I have appreciation for a good Chicago-style dog.)"}
{"text":"I'm on an Italian Beef kick. I was hoping Luke's would be the best. It wasn't.
The Beef was juicy and tasty. However the bread did not hold up. It couldn't hold the juicy Beef. Fries are crinkle cut and good. It doesn't seem like a happy group working there. No smiles. Oh, it's better than Portillo's"}
{"text":"Great food a bit on the pricey side but well worth it! Remember restroom code is 1911 lol! Great array of Chicago memorabilia and a TV to watch the news. Great picture of the Chicago skyline I miss and enjoyed."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch and was eager to give Luke's a try. This guy loves me some Italian Beef. With that said, I ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich with sweet peppers, onion rings, and a fountain drink. Total price for the meal was over $14. In my opinion the meal was pretty pricey. As for taste, the Italian was good. Not amazing, lacked a little seasoning that I love with Italian Beef, but it was good. The real winner were the onion rings. They had a great crunch and flavor and would recommend. Overall, a decent spot but still in search of amazing Italian Beef."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find, I took my daughter the young lady behind the counter was very nice. The place was clean and the food was excellent. The only draw back would be if its crowed a lack of seating and parking. Who cares I would eat their food standing up just like Gene & Jude's back in Chicago area."}
{"text":"I had the jr beef and fries. The food was good but the price is kind of high. They charge for every topping (sweet pepper, hot pepper and cheese). They are not that friendly either. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I am really picky about my Chicago cuisine....I normally frequent the lukes on ray and the 101, but decided to try this one since I'm working in phoenix now...
I was thoroughly disappointed...had to ask for extra relish and mustard since there wasn't much on the hot dog...the chili cheese fries were just ok and I swear they male them differently at the one in chandler...."}
{"text":"Went here again recently. Still terrible. Bad service. Unfriendly employees. Dirty tables. Roaches in restroom. Gross. Stay away."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style restaurant with quick and friendly counter service. Their Italian beef is awesome and the hotdogs were pretty good as well. I'd recommend this place as its probably one of the better fast lunch options on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best around to grab a delicious meal! The food is always fresh and on point. I've eaten at so many other places and nothing compares, not only is the food AMAZING but the service is fantastic! The owner is one of the most friendly and real person you will meet and Desiree is such a sweet person who makes you feel welcome and wanted, she is extremely friendly and gets your food to you HOT! I'll be coming back as much as possible! If you like spicy ask for the hot peppers!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a business lunch around noon on a weekday and we narrowly avoided the lunch rush: this place is POPULAR (and for good reason).

Based on recommendations here, I ordered the Italian sausage with sweet and hour peppers and let them do the sandwich in au jus, which they recommended. For me, that was too wet and messy; I would prefer the sauce on the side.

The owner's son attended us at the counter and was pleasure to meet. He was incredibly enthusiastic about the restaurant (even though he said he had been working there since he turned 12) and equally knowledgeable about the product, recommending a number of substitutions and configurations.

Basically, my food was an exalted, gourmet version of Costco's polish dog and I loved it. I'm looking forward to trying the beef sandwich next time."}
{"text":"I decided to give Luke's another shot.....I am glad I did....I still hold true to my review about their Italian Beef, but their Hot dogs...now that's a whole different story!!! TRUE Chicago Vienna Beef Hotdogs with all the fixin's!!! A warm poppyseed bun was the first sign that this was the real deal! It was topped with Mustard, Onion, Tomato, Relish, and the true test to whether this is an authentic Chi Hot dog....CELERY SALT!! The cheese fries are like a local hot dog joint in Chicago called U-DAWG-U...SO GOOD!!!  Can't wait to go back and I am sorry for the negativity the first time around! :o)"}

{"text":"Tried this place 3 times now and each time the order is messed up, staff is very rude , not friendly ! I do not recommend this place, the food was not the best either."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give 1 star, but the beef was good. Got 2 Italian roast beef sandwiches and fries.

LOUSY service, mediocre proportions vs others around, no fresh cut fries! Hardly any giardiniera. Come on. Fresh cut fries are sooo much better and cheaper for the store. 

Rude fat bastard working the counter. Even my mom couldn't believe how rude he was. He acted like it was the worst day of his life and he wanted to burn the place down or something.

Almost every other place I have tried has more meat and no probs with customer service. Rosati's was better. Joey's was better. Chicago hamburger company was better. Defalcos was better. Philadelphia sandwich company was better, kinda. PSC is kinda hit and miss.

Luke's was good a long time ago. With so many other places serving basically the same thing, you have to set yourself apart from other places. Luke's does, but in a bad way. And if you've ever had a sandwich in Chicago, DOESN\"T EVEN COMPARE! Twice if not 3x more meat.

AND I ASKED FOR IT DIPPED! THEY DIDN'T!"}
{"text":"I think Luke's is great.  Best Italian beef I've had in the valley.  

I moved here from Chicago about 4 years ago and although I haven't been on a mad hunt the whole time, I have had some disappointing beefs.  Luke's is by far the best I've had.  

I think the best value is to buy a pound of beef and peppers from Luke's and cook it at home.  You have to buy your own bread, I like sub rolls.  The preparation is easy; just simmer in a pot on real low heat.  Then you can make em as juicy and messy, or dry as you like.  I find buying a pound will feed 3-4 and it's cheaper.

I haven't had anything else there."}
{"text":"The Italian beef was fantastic! Good prices and authentic Italian sandwiches. Also the zucchini was really good. Made fresh and you can taste it."}
{"text":"This is a hot-dog joint for people who love hot dogs. My father, for instance, eats enough hot dogs to put a baseball stadium out of business over the course of a year, and this is his favorite spot around. As he put it \"No question the best Polish sausage in Phoenix.\" 

Service here is friendly and fast. On top of that, Friday's are the day to drop in as the owner's wife personally prepares brownies and rice krispie treats that are given out with meals for free."}
{"text":"there are so many places around the valley that try to cater to the large chicago native population...but no other place brings me back to the good ol days of portillos greasy, juicy beef sandwhiches..and cheesey cheesey fries...and of course...the tamales! just how i remember them...

there is one person that complained how greasy the sandwhiches are -that's how theyre supposed to be! that's what makes tthem oh-so-delicious...

i live right down the street from this place and always like to splurge when i'm feeling in the mood for some good greasy grubby food. the guy that runs the place is always extremely friendly and i have never had a bad sandwhich here..."}
{"text":"Luke's is the best Chicago joint in town. Period. Their Italian sausage is to die for, and so it their Italian beef. While the other stores that have recently opened around town are certainly delicious, nothing beats the original. Something about the atmosphere and the people working at this place make me feel like I'm right back in Chicago. I recently started buying their sausage from them by the lb and taking home to gril up myself. Ive found there's just no place to make the quality and flavor that Luke's has. Hats off to Luke's!"}
{"text":"Great beef, great bread, great sausage. It is a bit greasy and the fried zucchini leaves a bit to be desired, but overall it is incredible. If you are a fan of Chicago style Italian sandwiches then stop by Luke's. Try the tamale if you're feeling ironic or just go with the beef and sausage combo with sweet peppers if you want a juicy kick in the mouth."}
{"text":"Just got off a plane back from my hometown of Chicago were I didn't get a chance at a beef sandwich, but I know where to go in Phoenix and that's Luke's, service can be off at time's but the food is still spot on . Good Chicago food in Phoenix, will continue to be back"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years. The food is ok, but the staffs' attitudes are terrible. Such a shame. There are so few choices in the immediate area that if the staff were nicer I think they would have lines out the door.  I personally stopped going because of the poor customer service."}
{"text":"When I think of hot dogs I think of Luke's of Old Chicago's. Their hot dogs are the real deal piled high with an array of condiments and fries all wrapped up in wax paper to go to get that Old Chicago feeling. My wife and I have been there many times over the years and never had bad service, the staff is top notch! Best place to go in Phoenix to get a dog!"}
{"text":"So close!!!!!

For the last 15 months, I've been searching the valley looking for a passable italian beef sandwich.  I think I found it at Luke's.

It's not great, it's not amazing, it's not orgasmic, but it's good.  Ok, so probably somewhere in between good and very good.  

The beef here is about as close to Chicago style as you're going to get; thinly sliced, properly seasoned with some nice sweet peppers.  The bread is a little different than I'm used to, most Chicago places serve their beefs on an 8'' roll that is close to a bratwurst roll.  Luke's serves theirs on about a foot long thing that resembles french bread.  

The sandwich is authentically messy and drippy.  Please don't expect to eat this daintily.  It does not happen.  Roll up your sleeves and bring extra napkins.  

I'll be back when I need a fix and don't mind eating an entire day's worth of calories in one sitting."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style hot dogs and Italian Beef in the Valley.  Cheese fries!!! Service can be hit or miss but never terrible.  The food is as good as it gets when it comes to greasy fare!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, I found it a little pricey and the staff was either spacey or just didn't care (I didn't get a can of soda I paid for). The food is excellent though. I started getting the food to go, the place itself is a little annoying to hang out at."}
{"text":"just ate dinner here tonight....WoW...Still the best! Italian Beef was Awesome! Chili Cheese fries were BomB! food was hot, fresh, and brought to our table fast. If you lkie Chicago style, you have to get over there."}
{"text":"Love hole in the walls with good food?  This is a place to try. Had the combo (sausage and Beef). And a Vernors Can. Bread was perfect. Crusty and still held up to the Au Jus.  Will try just the beef next time I'm around hat side of town."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at Luke's! And this comes from a Chicago kid who used to eat their pizza puffs back in the day! Everything about the beef or meatball sandwiches is perfect.

I'm glad they've started offering a smaller version of the beef sandwich - now I CAN order Pizza puffs to go with a small beef. The net result is a small bit of heaven shines down into my me. Ahh, Lukes..."}
{"text":"This my friends, is the long time home of the Best Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich in Phoenix ! 

What in the dickens makes a good Italian Beef Sandwich? Well, it depends on who you ask to a certain extent. 

My unbiased opinion of what makes this the perfect sandwich, starts with in house, slow cooked, thinly sliced, Beef, with a blend of Italian spices and it's own natural juices. You add that to the perfect type of roll that is dipped in those juices, a slice of provolone cheese is added to the steaming beef and roll, then top it off with house made giardinara, made of Zucchini, Olives, Serrano Chilies, Carrots, and Olive Oil, and boom....There you have it! Top it off, by pouring a cup of the beef stock over the sandwich before you put your bib on and create a dam of napkins on the table for the inevitable mess that the authentic sandwich is going to create. ;) 

Note to those who get all hurt and flustered about the house made giardanara because they use Serrano chilies, they do offer the pickled giardanara as an alternative option as well. So don't shoot them down before you go and give the place a shot. 

The fries are crispy on the outside and like a mashed potato on the inside. 

The Polish, and Brat are real sausage links from their own supplier, not the crappy hotdog like sausages that you get from a hotdog stand on the street of a crappy neighborhood or from a place like Lobby's in Tempe. 

The only thing that sometimes throws off the consistent experience for me, is that at times when I ask for a side of the beef stock, it isn't stirred before they dish it up, and it has a thick layer of oil in the cup, rather than the aqueous layer beneath which contains all of the flavor. This is something that they could take as a constructive criticism at times.

The only other establishment that serves up a perfected version of this beef sandwich is the owners brother who just opened up Chicago's Taylor Street. He was the best maker of theses sandwiches at Lukes for years, and recently opened up his own spot. It's great to see some competition in this Valley, especially with a couple of brothers competing with eachother. It should help keep the standards high, which should create a good product for us.

Try out both of these spots and write an according review to spark up the competition to the two current greats in the Valley of the Sun.

Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"Had the Italian beef with hot peppers. Although it was good it is unnecessarily greasy. Didnt like the bread being soggy at the bottom either.
 I'll go back though and try sumthn different.
Service was good."}
{"text":"I had high hopes coming in but ended up disappointed.  Soggy bread and generic fries is really what I walked away with but the meat was pretty good.  Not $14.00 for the meal good but pretty good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Chicago style toppings were right but felt like a cold smoked sausage not polish. Rather have had portillos. Kept wanting to drive back and let them know."}
{"text":"FOOD: During a lunch break in between classes one day, my buddy insist he drive me over to 16th St and Indian School (from ASU) for an Italian Beef sandwich. I must say, the drive was worth it. Luke's Italian Beef sandwich is so oddly delicious, you'll forget that it's probably a leading cause of heart attacks in the area. The sandwich looks plain and messy, but bite into it and you will know what I'm talking about. I haven't had many Italian beef sandwiches in my days, but Luke's has brought the food some considerable respect from me. 

PRICE: Good prices, great place to get take out or when you're on the move. You can spend less than $10 for sure. 

ATMOSPHERE: Let's just say don't bring a date here. Great place to eat with a friend or two. But the dining area is limited, fits maybe 20 people. 

SERVICE: The guys are friendly even though they come off as tough guys. Just don't make any Chicago Cubs jokes and you'll be fine. 

SKINNY: If I lived closer, I would go to Luke's much more often. It's a delicious, fast place to grab some food without lowering yourself to crappier fast foods. The food makes me feel so full and bloated, but that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I'm trying all the Chicago joints lately and stopped here because my patient told me that Luke's had a very good beef. Went in and had combo, extra hot, dipped.  Beef was very good, gonnella bread, homemade giardiner was a nice change and really added to the peppery taste.  Hotdogs don't remind me of home but they have RC and that alone puts u in 5 stars.  Best pop ever!  I'd go for the beef, fries, RC"}
{"text":"Being a Chicago guy, I can't say enough about how much I enjoy an Italian Beef Sandwich from Lukes. They're exactly like what I used to eat growing up. Put the peppers on them if you know how to eat one right. 

The place is as Chicago as it gets. If you order a hot dog with everything on it, they don't include ketchup unless you specifically ask. Their supplier is Vienna Beef, and they even have the neon green relish. The fries are even the exact the same as the Chicago locations. 

The place is also very Chicago themed. Pictures and posters of the Windy City and its sports teams surround you. And if stop by during a Cubs game, rest assured it will be playing on the TV. 

The prices are the one big negative that keeps me from driving over to Luke's more often. Although the food tastes great, and is worth the value for an occasional trip, it's a lot of money for greasy fast food.  But if you're looking for an authentic Chicago hot dog or Italian Beef in Phoenix, hit up Luke's."}
{"text":"Been a fan for years, ate here yesterday to get my regular hot dog but the bun was a little different.  It was hard on the edge but it still ended up pretty good everywhere else.  This place has been cleaned up pretty well over the years.  I even noticed the health inspections have finally gotten better.  I would be lying if I didn't tell you that this is my favorite hot dog in town and occasionally crave it.  The area is scary so you may want to exercise your second amendment right when you come here.  Also parking blows since there is always more people that want to go here at lunch than spots to park.  It is a very casual place that you order at the counter and seat yourself.  This place used to be a fried chicken fast food place I think about 20 years ago when I was a kid."}
{"text":"First time here today, went with a coworker.  I had the Italian beef and sausage sandwich and it was delicious.  The beef was more shaved/shredded than sliced which I personally liked, I think it seemed to make it tender.  The sausage was a delicious Italian link, not too spicy but just enough kick to add that extra flavor.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their dishes because I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in Chi town. Good Italian beef w giardinera peppers and fried zuchinni. Definitely coming back since I work a mile away."}
{"text":"Who thinks they can eat Chicago food and not have grease and artery clogging cheese and meats? Really, Get real. 

Love this place. Been going to the Indian School location since they opened the location. They did have some trouble for a while with the bread they were ordering as it wasn't that nice crusty flakey bread, But recently when I went there it was pretty darn good.

So if you want a good fattening meal check it out. If you want to eat healthy, try a salad or Tru food."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I'm always on the lookout for food that reminds me of home, so the other night when a friend and I were trying to decide where to grub I mentioned that I could go for an Italian beef. He said he knew a spot, so we ended up at the Scottsdale Luke's, and it was so good that I had my parents meet me at the Indian School location a week later to try that one out.

Both times I had an Italian beef with cheese, no peppers, and a side of fries with cheese, and an RC Cola to wash it all down. The problem with most Italian beef sandwiches I've had out here is the beef itself...usually it's chewy or just sub-par, but Luke's gets it right. The beef is tender, juicy, and just right. The sandwiches come dipped (wet), so it's a sloppy ordeal but that's how it's supposed to be. If you don't want to get a little messy with your dinner, then ask for it \"dry\". 

I'll definitely be back, but I'm gonna have to limit my visits as this ain't exactly healthy eats...however, I'm ok with that for food that tastes this good."}
{"text":"Over priced, burger and fries 12 bucks without drink, single pattie, delicious but not worth $12, had the hotdog, nothing great, staff not friendly at all, been there a few times, same unfriendly service, don't think I'll go there again"}
{"text":"You just can't beat an Italian beef, hot and sweet, with provolone.   Heart-stopping, oily crunchy, beefy goodness.   I've been going here for nearly 15 years, and it's a good thing I don't live close by Luke's because it would considerably shorten my lifespan."}
{"text":"Had a really good beef and sausage combo dipped in aujus (gravy).  Make sure you ask for extra gravy.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"True Chicago Luke's gets their food shipped from Chicago and has a local bread company make his rolls they way they should be you want to taste Chicago in the desert go to Luke's of Chicago get a beef and some onion rings we drive and hour to go here!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Italian Beef for the first time in the AZ area and loved it!!

Definitely go there if you have a desire for Italian Beef Sandwiches when first entering into the AZ area."}
{"text":"mmmmmmm, Lukes.  I've been tempted by other items, but I cannot drag myself away from that Italian Beef.  Wet, with provolone.  sublime.  Their french frys?  These guys really know how to treat a crinkle-cut fry.  Hot, crispy to the tooth, with a creamy potato inside.  A dash of salt.  Damn, now I want to go back.  Do you think they are open at 6:00am on a Sunday?"}
{"text":"I recently had this for the first time a few weeks ago. One word; AMAZING.

My boyfriend is a Chicago native and he's been looking for authentic Chicago food for as long as I can remember now. We drove past this place and he burst out w, \" BABE WE HAVE TO GO IN SOME DAY YOU HAVE TO TASTE MY KIND OF FOOD \"
And so we did (: my first dish was 2 Pizza Puffs, lol. THEY MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS IN HEAVEN ON EARTH. Boyfriend got me 2 bc he knew I'd love it and boy was he right!! The both of us are going to be regulars, not disappointed (:"}
{"text":"If you don't like grease than don't come here.  The food is so greasy I can see how it can turn some people off but it is oh so good.  The fries are crispy and the Italian Beef and Italian sausage sandwiches are great.  If I have a complaint it that there is not enough giardena put on when you order it, plus it is placed on top of the sandwich and half of it always seems to fall off.  Soda's are on the low end of the soda chain, who serves RC? Really?  Dripping good sandwhiches- no need to ask for it wet."}
{"text":"A cozy place with red brick walls and a picture of downtown Chicago on the wall. Food is greasy and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"CHICAAAGGOOOOO! Wow, and right down the street from me. I'm so gonna get fat. I love the Combo Italian Beef and Sausage....an Italian Sausage topped with Italian Beef. OMG. Add the sweet and hot peppers and that delicious sauce that soaks into the bread. Can you say Heaven?

I don't know if I've ever been served by the owner like Chris, but everyone I've run in to there has been very cordial. Not overly pleasant per se....but hey, what do you want from a Chicagoan? Straight to the point and they get the job done. 

Also, get the Chicago grown Green River soda. Only place out here I've ever seen it."}
{"text":"if you are from chicago, massachusettes, michigan, new york, or pa, you will want to eat here, it has the foods you grew up with, great sausage, beef, hot dogs and finally china mist tea.  the owner and staff are great."}
{"text":"I've been here about 8 times and the experience was the same every-time.

The bread is always soggy and it is inevitable if you dine in or take out the bread will always be soggy. I am not from Chicago but I think that universally soggy bread it not preferred.

The ownership and employees are all miserable. A nice bunch of negative people.

Go elsewhere.. For $18 you can get a much better meal in the area."}
{"text":"The sandwich is hands down 4 star. The roll was falling apart a bit much but the meat was excellent. Faux news on the TV is worth 2 strikes, and RC Cola in the fountain... that's just plain unacceptable. Maybe one of two of those I could tolerate, but not both."}
{"text":"If you want a great Chicago hot dog and a great Italian Beef go to Lukes. The fries are good too. Friendly, quick service and great food combined with Bears and Cubs stuff everywhere. How can you beat this. This is the best comfort food Phoenix has to offer. Go here, eat and be happy."}
{"text":"Owner or whoever was at the counter was extremely rude. I asked if they sold hot dogs because I was not familiar with the menu and the guy replies, \"I don't know, we're getting ready to close.\" okaaay???? 
So I went to Johnnie's instead and had the BEST Chicago style hot dog and it was cheaper too!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want an authentic Chicago dog! And the fries.... OMG! Everything tastes really fresh. Service is not amazing but it's not terrible either."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and their beefs suck ass....., $27 for 2 beefs 2 fries and 2 small drinks.  The beef was greasy , the giardinara was sliced up jalapeños and onions with oil thrown on them I almost puked. Their fries are frozen store bought. If you want a decent beef you're better off going to Portillos. What a waste of time and money.  Whoever taught the 400 pound fit in the back how to make beefs needs to be shot. Totally disappointed! !!!"}
{"text":"Drove past this place and seeing that they had Italian beef, I had to try one. Waited in line (lunch rush) and was quickly helped and given my food. I've had Italian beef sandwiches in Chicago and several that claimed to be \"real Chicago\". This one was decent, but not great. I'd probably go back again but it's not something to go out of your way for. They're very quick in handling their line and keep things moving well."}
{"text":"Good sandwich, fries were hot and Tea was cold.
I eat out for lunch everyday all around Phoenix and the west and east valleys. Price was very high. Junior beef with cheese(small)$5.60 + .70(cheese)=$6.30, Regular fries $2.85, Medium drink $2.00. Tax .85. Total $12.08. Will not go back unless I hit lottery."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sandwich and the meatballs were the size of a two tennis balls. Not only were they were plentiful and flavorful, they were smothered in delicious cheese and yummy sauce."}
{"text":"I hate to even give this place a star but I have no choice. We walked in and we were not greeted. There were two men in their 50's behind the counter looking at their iPad and talking about some girl (of course you can hear the whole conversation because they were ignoring us). We ordered two kids chicken tender meals for $8.80 each and they didn't come with a drink when he said they did. I asked for bbq sauce for the tenders and the only thing they had was ranch. I'm from Chicago and this place is a joke and shouldn't display a city that has some of the best food around. Very insulting"}
{"text":"Damn you Luke's! I wanted to flippin' love you. They way I love Tori Spelling movie marathons on Lifetime. They way I love baby's breath in my hair after a bubble bath. And the way I love the smell of gasoline while pumping gas. Really. It's not bad for you...

But Luke's, you remain a middle of the road 3 stars. The place was jumpin' around 1:30 recently. I ordered a sausage and peppers to go with cheese and a large side of fries (\"more than enough he said for 2 to share). The sausage, while tasty enough, was pretty dry. Then crusty white bread had too many REALLY REALLY mushy parts. Basically half of it fell apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a mo. The crinkle fries were awesome. Crinkly and crunchy. Though not the enormous portion I anticiapted.  The large fries were $3.75 and the sandwich was $5.50. 

Service was spot on. Friendly and fast. I'll visit again, though I'll be sure to try a Chicago dog or Bratwurst!"}
{"text":"A treasure for any real Chicagoan.. since moving to AZ I've been hard pressed to find good food. I happened to pass by Luke's several times when they were closed. Well today after being sick for the past week and on a strict liquid diet i finally got my appetite back and wanted something but wasn't sure what i wanted. After searching the web for restaurants near me Luke's popped up and boy am i glad it did. I took the 5 minute drive and as soon as i walked into the place i knew that this wasn't just a restaurant this was a joint.. a true chicago joint. As soon as you cross the threshold you're no longer in Phoenix you're in Chicago. The owner Cary is a very friendly guy and we chatted for a good bit about back home. This joint really brought me back to my childhood when i would frequent my neighborhood not to mention the food which was amazing.. just like back home. Luke's also features Jays potato chips and Green River & RC pop. If you're a Chicagoan or someone that always wondered what Chicago food is all about i highly recommend Luke's of Chicago. I honestly cannot wait until my next visit. Keep up the great work Luke's!!"}
{"text":"Beef was very good!  Not a huge fan of their giardiniera... but it was still tasty.  I needed to go somewhere where I could see a Walter Payton jersey and some pictures of Michigan Avenue and this did the trick!  Since I don't live close to a Portillo's, I will be back here again.  Da Bears!"}
{"text":"The polish and hotdogs are fab.  The fries are done the way I remember them from Chicago."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Vienna beef? Vienna beef is pretty much the only kind of hot dogs I will eat because they are so tasty. I came here and had a chicago dog and it was good....but really, how could it be bad? It had the neon green relish and the sport peppers, it was great. The fries were crispy and salty. The price was right (2 of us ate for about 10$). I used to come to Luke's as a kid, and it's just as good now as it was then. Definitely drop by if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Chicago and I can tell you this place is the closest I've come to getting an Italian beef sandwich from home. Only, I get twice as much meat for a cheaper price. I bought an Italian beef sandwich and small fries for $10 and change???

First off the parking sucks, although the location is easily accessible. The place is also small and I don't believe can set 50 people more less 25 comfortably. Now, on to the food;  I've yet to try everything on the menu because I went for one thing only: the Italian beef. While the beef is thinly sliced, something about the seasoning is off. I'm used to getting my sandwich dipped and it not totally sopping up the bread. I also don't remember it tasting so oily.  As for the fries, again, I've had better. They're nicely crisped on the outside but dry as hell on the inside. WTH?

Makes me wanna go home."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Authentic Chicago. They have RC and Barq's Rootbeer on the soda fountain. I got a Jr Beef with sweet peppers, French Fries and a Pop. I'll tell ya, I was one happy customer. The cashier even hooked up me with the WiFi password. Heyyyy Luke, good job! Parking lot is a little tight so keep your hanger levels to a
Minimum when pulling in."}
{"text":"I think I have only had Italian beef fries and gelato here. Peoples comments on service are on point. Today was a little funny. Older lady who took my order seemed a little frazzled wasn't familiar with garlic parmesean fries and I was repeating everything.  

I asked about why phone kept ringing when I tried to call in order. Her response was boss was had to talk to wife for half hour then she had to make some phone calls as well. Food did come out quick and as always italian beef is great. I think next time Ill order dry and sauce on the side. The peppers are not hot. The fries were overcooked and next time Ill order regular fries. It was just garlic powder and dry parmesean. Was expecting fresh garlic and parmesean crumble that you can taste not what you get when you order take out pizza. 

JR size italian beef is more than enough for me Decent price close enough to work but there is another spot on the Arcadia side that is closer to home better service better hot peppers and even better price so now im going to change my rating to three stars."}
{"text":"ITALIAN BEEF = Sensationally, Soaking Good
** Served hot and fresh, super tender meat, soft roll absorbed nicely from  a very flavorful au jus sauce, under $7! [Very Filling]

HOT DOG =  Chicago-style Good
** Vienna beef on soft, steamy poppy seed buns
** Great tasting toppings, no complaint here!

FRIES = Hot and Crispy!
** The way I like 'em!

VIBE = Cozy, Low-Key, and Sporty (Scottsdale Location)

COMBO = HOT DOG + FRIES + DRINK = approx $6

Key Note: Beverages are RC Products :)

CONCLUSION: Its not a fancy joint, but its the closest to Chicago you can get in Phoenix.  The Scottsdale location makes the Italian Beef the same way, so there is consistency all the way around.  Luke's has been a regular lunch hit for me."}
{"text":"I've always liked Luke's, it's authentic Italian beef...how can you go wrong! Well, today was the exception. Spent $25.00 for two beef sandwiches, with everything, two pepsi's (medium) and a large order of fries. Just seems too high for a couple of sandwiches. Hey, I could have gone to Capital Grill for not that much more. 

Beef was somewhat bland today. Fries were awesome as usual, forgot to ask them to make them extra crispy...but they are good.

I'm going to take a Sabbatical from Lukes to check out more interesting places."}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday to give a try because fellow Yelper Anthony P swears by the fries and this place is so much closer to me than Port...'s (not long because the Tempe location opens Sept 10).  (I also hate to mention a competitor in my reviews, thus the abbreviation)

So went with a very close and dear friend visiting me from out of town.  She wanted a Chicago-style polish sausage and it was dinner time, so what a great opportunity to stop by Luke's.  I love Italian Beef sandwiches, so Luke's was the perfect place to stop in.

My friend ordered the polish sausage.  She was so satisfied with it that she wanted to go back the next day and have another.  I put a quick stop to that.   But we'll return before she leaves.  My friend said that the Polish Sausage was better than alot that she'd had in Chicago when she lived there.

I had the Jr Italian Beef and whoooooooo wee.  Lemme tell ya.  That thing is amazing and the Jr is HUGE.  I had it for dinner and lunch the next day!  Definitely the best in Phoenix and quite possibly better than most that I have had while I lived in Chicago too.  The bread is quite delicious.  I'm not a big bread eater, but a little dippy-dip-dip of the sandwich in the au jus and I have to sample the bread a little bit.  See, the Italian Beef is on a very dense bread that can hold up to single, double and triple dips in au jus!  Trust me when I say this, if you don't get your Italian Beef dipped, you're missing out on something special!!!!  I also had the giardiarano peppers on my sandwich.  Those were tasty but with little to no heat.  Not the best I've had.  The star of this sandwich is quite frankly... the beef.  Where's the beef?  Oh, Luke's has got it baby.  The beef on that Italian Beef melts in your mouth real real good while exploding with mellow saltiness and HUGE flavor in your mouth.  OH!  Goodness, I could scream that beefy goodness was just delicious!  The best tasting Italian beef I've had in a long long time.  Better tasting that Port..'s.  

This place is conveniently located right off the 51 on Indian School.  Very easy to locate.  Look for the sign with the little Chicago Gangster on it and the Pepsi products on the sign (they have 7UP, RC cola, etc).   It is a small place, so I would not say it is good for large groups.  But certainly you can go with a group of 6 or less and should be comfortable, provided they don't have a crowd already there.  The menu has a lot more to choose from, ever heard of a Chicago style hot dog?  Uhm yeah... i've heard Luke's dogs are good too!  They close fairly early, 8pm.

So, why the 4 star, well, I docked them for the lack luster peppers and the fries.  My good Yelping buddy Anthony P swears by these fries, but the fries were just *aight* for me.  So, I had to dock them for not providing an all around amazing experience.  BUT still... my friend and I are returning this week.... for round 2.  Trust me... That thick giant beefy sandwich is worth it... and my friend likes the polish sausage too.  TWSS."}
{"text":"I love Luke's! Originally, I was referred to them by my girlfriend's parents who swear by this place. I have had their Italian hot beef, their burgers, and hot dogs and I am always completely satisfied. A little greasy, but well worth the money!"}
{"text":"disclaimer: everything you read on this review is completely true. and awesome.

about 6 or so years ago i was hauling my ass thru the 19th ave Peoria area in the middle of the night...having fun. yea!! so out of nowhere. whoop whoop. i get pulled over, long story short, i get a ticket and opt out with traffic school. so a couple weeks later.....i'm at this super huge church on the corner of Central and Glendale, you know the one. looks like a space age community college, well this was the location for traffic school. so traffic school starts early in the am, ho hum boring right. well it comes to lunch break, and this random lady stands up and announces to everyone that she is providing lunch and that she owns Luke's and will have her employees bring over Italian beef on the lunch break. i was like..cool...speeding does pay off after all. lol.

first time having Luke's was a little strange, it was delivered over and sorta mass produced. there was like 50 of us in traffic school, still really good. and i have this cool story to remember about the first time I've had Luke's. haha. I've been into the restaurant more then a hand full of occasions for normal encounters with Luke's..awesome Chicago dog."}
