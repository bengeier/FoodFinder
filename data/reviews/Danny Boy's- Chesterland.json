{"text":"Popped in here for a try after dropping the car off down the street and was immediately impressed with the size of this place! ordered baked meatballs, they were tasty and the garlic bread that came with it was so tasty! I asked the waitress what she usually ordered, she suggested Sylvios Creamy Chicken. It was monstrous in volume and delicious. He ordered the fettucini alfredo and topped it with blackened chicken. Next time we are just going to split one dish! Service was good and attentive, I loved the music and its level. Fun decor. I would like to see this place full for the experience. Was there for monday lunch so it was mostly empty."}
{"text":"Casual environment with alot of selection from the menu but we stuck with pizza as it was our first time there.  We ordered Chicago style and regular pies, appetizers and drinks.  The server was attentive and always checking on us.  We did not go in thinking it wold be anything great but would defiantly go back.  Just don't go in thinking your going to get true Chicago style pizza.  The pizza was good but nothing close to what I've had from Chicago."}
{"text":"Definitely not on my list of restaurants to recommend. We went their for lunch. Ordered nachos and Chicago pizza. For starters the water had a funny taste. Can't describe it but just a bad taste.  Our nachos barely had any cheese over it. Otherwise they were ok. Our server was forgetful. Lastly our pizza was not what I call quality pizza. The sauce is HORRIBLE. The cheese is not of good quality. Last but not least the ladies bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned from the day before.   I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with a big bar,I have been there a lot and most of the time it is really good. I usually get just a regular pizza with pepperoni and my wife likes one of their specialty pizza's called the Frank's. They have some different menu choices but what I have tried has been good. The frosted beer glasses are so cold you end up with small ice chips in your beer"}
{"text":"Ate lunch on Monday March 10, 2014.  Ordered hamburger and husband ordered a folded ground beef sandwich. So much grizzle that about a fourth of it was un-chewable.  Same with my husband's sandwich. Service was polite but SLOW.  Will not return. Will not recommend."}
{"text":"Our company placed an order for pick up. It was one sub and three salads with the dressings on the side. They said pick up time would be 30 min. 30 minutes later, I got there but I had to wait 15 minutes because when I arrived they said it would be  a little late because they had to wait for new lettuce. It finally came out but there was no sub. I had to wait another 15 minutes for them to get the sub. We had people at our business waiting and  we were on a tight schedule. Then once we finally got all the food and back to eating it, we realized they had not put any dressing with any of the salads. It was a very poor experience."}
{"text":"We went because we got a coupon in the mail, and we are very glad we did!  Danny Boy must be a big boy, because everything, from appetizers on down, is HUGE.  I strongly suggest splitting entrees, and I usually dislike splitting.   The appetizers and pizza were fantastic; service was spot-on.  Nice Sinatra decor and nice family atmosphere.  Great discovery."}
{"text":"Good salads, good pizza, good kids' menu. I can't believe it took us this long to find a good Chicago-style pizza in Cleveland. We've lived here 8 years and have always had to mail order from Gino's East.  Now, it's just a short drive to Chesterland!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with my fiancee for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  We ordered a Luca Brasi which was a chicken parm sub and a woogie melt which was a NJ chicken melt.   both were excellent.  We got loaded fries and they were ok, but quickly got cold and stuck together with the cheese. I loved the decor of the restaurant and it was pretty clean.  While it was a Browns game Sunday, it wasn't crowded at all."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas with my girlfriend and her brother, they had the buffalo chicken, I had the Chicago.  Just got done having some awesome food poisoning from what I can only assume is bad / under cooked sausage.  Still have that awesome smell in my nose."}
{"text":"55 min wait for takeout and a $7 draft beer served in a plastic cup.... smh. The wait time could be excused as an anomaly and the fact it was 6pm on a Saturday however the wait time isn't much better when they're serving 4 people in the entire restaurant. Also, if it's a total surprise for them to be serving crowds on a Saturday night... Maybe they shouldn't?  On a positive note, the food was great."}
{"text":"I didn't know another Danny Boys location existed beyond the Bay Village location.  This one is huge.  Really nice bar.  I would watch a few college and pro football games here for sure.  Good price on short and tall Christmas Ale.  I always defer to the Clevelander pizza but this time I got a small (check that, small) calzone and it was humongous.  Pricey too $12.99.  The french fries are DELISH.  Wow, what a nice surprise.  Our male waiter was a little on the slow side and he didn't come around very much.  He forgot to order said french fries so we had to ask for them.  A few arcade games for the kids and adults (what adult can say no to a vicious game of air hockey after a few Christmas Ales?).  Exactly."}
{"text":"Wandering around, getting to know the area, doing errands.  (DMV - Good Grief!)  Happened by Danny Boy's in Chesterland and decided to do an early dinner.  What a menu!  The restaurant makeover shows would have a field day with this behemoth!  It would take years to try everything!  I ordered a chicken philly and my husband had a calzone.  We both enjoyed the visit.  Plenty of televisions for sporting events.  Clean bathrooms.  Good service."}
{"text":"So we're here because of a gift card,   now I know the sender really doesn't like me. The restaurant is freezing, servers are not well trained, the management sets them up for failure by not training them, and they try hard but due to bad management they haven't a chance,and then the food, tomato juice on cardboard isn't a pizza people ! The gluten free pie is devoid of any taste. The Chicago deep dish has like a gallon of sauce, and the ambiance, forget it, it's like a funeral home, how they stay in business is the real mystery, at 9 pm on a Saturday night the place was empty."}
{"text":"We went Saturday evening. Not too crowded. After approximately 5 minutes, the hostess finally took our name and told us about 30 min wait. My wife, son and I waited in the bar area. After, almost an hour we finally were given a table. We had to complain to get the table. The manager was so apologetic he comped our meal. The food was average, we had heard one of the better pizza places on the east side. My opinion nothing to write home about.  We had salad ( bagged?), buffalo wings, and 2 different pizzas. Family atmosphere, small game room there for the kids. Service is EXTREMELY poor Not worth the wait, and our meal was FREE."}
{"text":"Best and only thing I would ever order here is the deep dish pie - they recommend forty mins and since that's our drive time we call it in when we leave - sorry folks but twin newborns - to get out at all we have to tactically plan.   We got there and waited about another twenty minutes for the deep dish which came out warm not piping hot.  Not atrocious BUT why the wait if it didn't just come out? Oh well.   It's a teeny taste of Chicago that we crave about twice a year."}
{"text":"The individual who owns this place is a former disgruntled employee of Guido's Pizza - another Chesterland establishment located roughly a mile away on Route 306 - who basically stole all of the menu items from Guido's and kept them as his own.  How can anyone with any degree of self respect do something so asinine? The mere fact that the owner has no integrity and has to lay claim to his former employer's recipes illustrates his severe lack of business expertise. Additionally, the service is non-existent, it's almost as if they deliberately try to make you feel as if you're at the bottom of their priority list.  Don't waste your time with this detestable imposter - it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"Well nothing good to write.the peppero I calzone had three peices of pepperoni How pityful.like put some pepperoni in it.i showed the server and his answer was ill take it back.  Nothing else.my friends got deep dish pizza and two salads.there response was why did we come here Waste of money."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place.  Amazing atmosphere and even better food!  EVERYTHING is amazing so buy it.  Chicago pizza is my favorite and the sauce is special in of itself.  Try Their Asparagus salad and fatten up on the fried cheese.  Danny Boys is my new lover, DONT tell my wife."}
{"text":"Went with friends.  The hostess told us we had to wait.  Went to the restroom while waiting to be seated and there were many empty tables.  While waiting overheard the hostess tell a waitress she was making us and another party wait so that service could catch up.  Finally at the table,  the waitress brought coke for 3 persons ordered.  The pop was flat, when asked the waitress said the CO2 was out and she doesn't drink pop.  We should have been told so we could make a different choice.  She did bring different drinks when we requested, but served us as  though she was put out.  Two people ordered pizzas and the crust was brunt on both, only one person was given another pizza to take home.  The rest of our orders were good.    Conclusion,  food overall is good - service sucks,"}
{"text":"Great family friendly Italian restaurant. I love all of the Sinatra decor and the music. It's awesome that they have games for kids too. The sausage and peppers is my favorite. Usually not the place to go if you are in a hurry but they have playing cards at the tables to pass the time."}
{"text":"Atkins would've passed out just seeing the food here!  It's Carbo-licious!  Ginormous portions.  My daughter's kid's meal of chicken tenders was 4 big tenders and 2 giant pieces of bread (just about everything comes with that bread).    I had the \"appetizer\" pizza, I'd guess it was a 10-12\" pie (that's some app, right?)  It was a better than average pie, for sure.  Other diners with us enjoyed their pizza, pasta & sandwiches.  The décor is kind of Sinata/Sports Bar crossed with a Friday's.  It was clean.  The service was on the slow side, but in fairness, it was around 2 on a Saturday afternoon, and about 12 of us walked in, so they were overwhelmed.  I would certainly go back.  This is certainly a place where you'd split dishes, or order kind of \"family-style\", with the huge portions."}
{"text":"Went here to today with my husband on the advice of one of his co-workers and several of my co-workers also had good words about Danny Boys.  The restaurant is situated in a plaza so there is plenty of parking.  Don't let the outside fool you because you think this is going to be a small dive sports bar but, once you walk in there is plenty of room.  There is a large bar area and believe it or not they have bathrooms on each end of the restaurant, so no excuses to hold your urine after several beers, LOL!  They have plenty of booths and a game room area for the kiddies or those adults who like to play games with their beers.  Now, I know they are famous for their pizza but unfortunately my husband just had a pizza on Friday night, so pizza was out the question. The menu was extensive with sandwiches named for some famous faces, like Rocky Balboa and Frank Sinatra.  Incidently, that is was my husband ordered was the Sinatra Special and I ordered the Stoplight pasta.  My husband sandwich consisted of shaved ham, turkey & pepperoni with pizza cheese and toppings.  His sandwich came out bubbling hot with fries and breadstick that they make using their own pizza bread.  My pasta was fettucini pasta with red, green and yellow peppers with marinara sauce and my choice of jumbo shrimp and 2 breadsticks.  The pasta was awaesome.  This definitely will be a place we'll frequent.  The service was also exceptional."}
{"text":"Danny Boy's has time and time again served very good food with great service. Tonight, I had the Chopstick Salad with ranch dressing, and it was very good. Our server, Kim , was probably the best part of this experience (which is saying a lot). She was very nice and we had a delightful conversation. My order was slightly messed up-a full salad instead of a half- but our server was nice enough to only charge for the half. All in all it was a nice experience with some very good food."}
{"text":"Getting the DB Bistro Salad. Yum!  Had this salad once before. Much better than Cafe 56, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"we were there for the first time to have dinner & hear the band last 04/17/2015. we sat at a table @ the bar.no waitress server approached us.we had to go to the bar to order our drinks.the bartender never had a smile on her face.it seemed we were an inconvenience to her. had to go the front desk to ask for food service .food was good,but took a long time .don't think i'll be going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"What can I say about Danny Boys? They have the worst service you can imagine. Order dine in or take out and they will find some new and creative way to screw something up.  I've waited for pick up for 20 minutes OVER the 30 minute estimate, had food delivered to my home after more than 1 hr 30 minutes on more than a few occasions, and today they forgot all together. They must have zero training because none of them know how to operate the computer system or take an order.  There's even one kid that acts like he's too good to take your order. The food is fair, sometimes only mediocre but not bad. But it's a small town with few options, fewer that deliver so what are you going to do?  We just laugh at them and joke about what new colossal mistakes Danny Boy's will come up with.  Oh Danny Boy."}
{"text":"Danny Boy's is a local restaurant by where I intern. We decided to go here to have a district wide meeting with all the counselors. The place was pretty dead around noon, it didn't even seem like many take out orders were being placed. 3 of my group of 5 ordered salads. Apparently salads there are delicious, and I should have listened. But I wanted bacon, dammit. So I ordered that BLT wrap with pesto mayo and upgraded my chips to be cajun fries. It sounded like it had serious potential.  Unfortunately the wrap was just whatever. Definitely something I could easily make at home. The sundried tomato wrap really made it unappetizing. It just tasted like the wrap came from a bulk food store. Almost like chewing on soft plastic. The fries were basic. Typically I am in love with cajun flavoring though. In the end, I didn't finish my fries, and ripped open my wrap to only eat the BLT parts and avoid the W part."}
{"text":"It was a nice sunny day last Saturday and Hallie, my little girl, was fast asleep, so the wife and I decided to take a trip to Chesterland for a later lunch at Danny Boy's.  After all we did have a Groupon that was burning a hole in my wallet so we thought that as long as the kid stayed asleep, we were in good shape.  Thankfully we made it in and out before the little one even thought of starting to fuss.  We both decided to get a drink, me - 312 by Goose Island her - Menage blend.  Mine was delicious, cold, and ran about $5.50 for a 20-22oz glass and hers ran $6.00 for a standard glass of red.  She thought her wine was borderline stale, meaning Danny should have opened a new bottle, but we brushed it under the rug.  Service was good.  Restaurant wasn't overly busy.  Nice ambiance, music, and there are some old school games you can play with the kids or with your beer while waiting for your food.  As for the food, we thought the Bada Bing chips with buffalo sauce, melted mozz, and bleu cheese sounded good, and it sure was.  This is a perfect man food substitute for nachos and at only $6 bucks, it was well worth it.  We're going to make it at home next time we have people over.   As for dinner we decided to share the Clevelander Pizza.  This was a Chicago style pizza on a New York style crust.  This translates to a thin crust pizza with the sauce on top of the cheese and pepperoni, topped with basil and Parmesan.  We both agreed that the pizza was very good / great. Thought the sauce really made the pizza and IMO the sauce really makes or breaks some pizza.    Overall I'd highly recommend heading out there for a pizza and a beer.  The bread sticks looked really good so did all the sandwiches.  I will be out there again soon and you can bet that I will have an updated review coming shortly afterward."}
{"text":"Food = excellent. Service = hopefully this was the proverbial 'bad night'   We had a table of 7 on a very non-busy Saturday night. Couldn't get beer refills to save our lives. Waitress was really not around (odd when she stood to make a huge tip from 7 meals and lots of beers). I can tolerate a little tardiness with extra napkins, etc. But my beer was empty for a solid 20 min. We finally started going up to the bar to get more ourselves. Annoying but really can only take one star away because the food was AWESOME.  Pasta, pizza, breadsticks, all excellent. I've had Mac and Cheese pizza before and thought it was good but WOW, their take on this was great. Medium thick crust, penne noodles, gooey cheese and kettle chips (!) on top. A very nice touch.   Great food, hopefully service doesn't always suck. A solid place, I'd go again."}
{"text":"So I loved the danny boys that just opened in tallmadge... food is great.... severs are trained to the point where no matter who you get the service is almost identical word for word. So when my birthday rolled around and i had to decide on having my family who live in the eastern suburbs come down to me in akron I made a deal... I would come up to them and go to the one in chesterland.. What in the heck happened. This amazing place I went to in tallmadge vanished. Instead we get this bargain basement version. I made a reservation for 7... apparently  they somehow thought seven was 9. I was told I could have them hold a cake in the cool. I got there and the host who was also a server was totally lost. Our server must have lost her smile..... Cause I didn't see it around anywhere. The food took a long time to come out. It did not taste the same at all... it was loaded in pepper and basil and honestly over flavored. I saw a flat bread on one table that looked nothing like the one on ours. Ours looked like the normal pizza even tough it was thin crust. Something was wrong there. When we asked for the cake to be brought back out... they brought it out in the bag we gave it to them in. still packed  not even on a plate. No effort... just plopped there on the dang table... with forks and a pizza spatula? ummmmmmm okay.....seriously while really it wasn't a horrible experience... This was like night and day compared to the tallmadge one. I do not know if the locations are franchised,  meaning danny boys by name and recipe only but underneath a totally different restaurant but the owner of the tallmadge one should talk to the owner of the chesterland one and either fix it or do something cause i dunno.... something needs done"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service good!  What surprised me was the country music being played.  Thought this was a retro 40's Sinatra style place?"}
{"text":"I got the mac'n'cheese. SO RICH it was almost unbelievable. I had a few bites but couldn't go much beyond that. Took it home and never ate it. Portions are ungodly huge. If I were to go again I'd get pizza. Heard it's really good! The night we went it was pretty slow maybe 5-6 tables in the place and 4-5 bar patrons ... but service was SO slow. To the point where I had to go to the bar to get a second round of drinks and my friend was ordering two at a time."}
{"text":"Awesome calzones and various calzone-like sandwiches. They have many variations on that theme, and they're all good--and enormous. So I assume the pizza is too, but I can't stop getting my favorite calzones and \"foldover\" sandwiches! If you make room for salad, the salad rolls are really good.  The place is very nice inside, and very large with a huge bar, game room and many booths--it's like an optical illusion, because it looks tiny from the street (little plaza just east of McDonald's.) Less than 10 minutes from 271. Worth leaving Cuyahoga County for!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my fiancee on a Browns game Sunday afternoon. It wasn't crowded, we were seated right away. The server was nice and fast with the drinks and food. We order a chicken parm sandwich and a chicken melt woogie. Both sandwiches were very good. We ordered the loaded fries and while they were good when they first came out, the quickly got cold and stuck together with the cheese.  We would definitely come back here if we are in the area"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good food, games arcade, pool table, and a full bar. What else does a person need? I loved how they have a deck of playing cards on each table so you have something to do while you wait for your order to come out. Also great that you can bring the kids along and they'll have fun while you eat, instead of bugging you. :) Finally, I love how they are open so late in such a sleepy little town."}
