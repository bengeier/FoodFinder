{"text":"We decided to have Thai food for dinner and we hadn't been there for awhile. The food that was once flavourful and very fresh is now the complete opposite, no flavour at all. It seems like a Chinese food restaurant now. We won't be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"After living in Toronto almost 2 years, I have been ever searching for the best Thai food. When I lived back in Halifax, I worked at a Thai restaurant for almost a year, and got spoiled by their amazing, authentic cuisine, and hadn't been able to find anything even remotely similar in Toronto. Every time I've ordered Thai food since moving to Toronto, I have been greatly disappointed. 

Sunday I decided to order some food from Lime Leaf and hope for the best, and I was pleasantly surprised! Their spicy noodle tasted so authentic! Same flavours as my old workplace and I could have eaten about 100 of their spring rolls! SOOOO GOOD! My only criticism would be that their noodles were over cooked, a little mushy for my liking. But the flavour was there!

Kudos Lime Leaf, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is based of delivery.  

The food took an hour and fourty minutes to arrive.  The food was soggy and gross.  There was no apology and they would not answer the phone.  Had to contact them through justeat."}
{"text":"I just happened to be in the neighborhood shopping for clothes, and I got hungry.  I decided on the Lime Leaf basically because it was the only place around.  But it turns out scarcity doesn't always breed mediocrity.

This was not even close to the best Thai food I've had in the city, but it certainly was better than many places I've tried.  The staff was prompt, gracious and cute, and they bring out shrimp chips to everyone, I love shrimp chips!  The restaurant itself is well decorated, clean and modern and they had chic-but-still-usable table service. 

You can't argue with a $6.50 lunch special either.  I got the beef panang and it was way too mild... I should have asked them to make it spicy.  Other than the lack of spice, the veggies were fresh, the beef was tender and the panang curry was pretty good.  The lunch special comes with a spring roll, and I also got a satay for starters and a Thai iced tea.  The iced tea came pre-mixed with some toasted coconut sprinkled on top (as an aside, why are we putting solids in our beverages?? Isn't this counter-intuitive?  Choking risk?), and it was pretty good, but was from a bottle.  Those of you who have had fresh Thai iced tea know what I mean.

So if you find yourself at Eglinton Square Mall and don't want generic food-court garbage, just cross Vic Park and hit up the Lime Leaf.  It's A-OK."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.  When you first look at the menu and see Kung Pao chicken and General Tso's chicken alongside Thai green curry, you think there is no way the Thai food is good here if they also serve Canadian Chinese food!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the Curry Ayam with roti, a malaysian dish, and the spicy flavors were so rich and flavorful.  It came with roti, a sweet flaky flat bread, which was the perfect complement, as was the salad, which was kind of like a coleslaw, but without the creaminess, and it had some nice lime and coriander flavours it in -just refreshing enough to balance the richness of the curry.  I had a taste of my friend's pad thai as well, and it was delicious (did not taste like ketchup like pad thai you get at some establishments).  I will definitely come back.  The only thing of concern was that the restaurant's liquor license expired and they said they were not planning on renewing it.  I don't drink much, and I more interested in the food, so that did not matter to me, but it might matter to others."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy writing poor reviews but after giving Lime Leaf two chances I have to admit I'm not impressed.

I love Thai and Malaysian cuisine and usually I'm not too picky but how can a restaurant serve substandard Tom Yum Soup and gloppy (is that a word?) red veggie curry. yick! 

On my first visit I got 2 take out orders of Tom Yum soup. The broth wasn't very flavourful. The tofu inside the soup tasted \"old\". I didn't enjoy it and didn't finish my food. 

The second time I tried the red curry with tofu + eggplant. They must have put too much coconut milk or something because the normally saucy curry was gloppy. Sadly, my tummy was turning after just a few bites and writing this review brings back those unpleasant memories.
I tried to force the leftovers the next day as to not waste food but could only manage a few bites. The taste of the curry was also off, to me.

Unfortunately, I won't be returning to Lime Leaf."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout twice from Lime Leaf now and I've been happy with my orders both times.

I had a craving for Thai Green Curry and decided to give Lime Leaf a call. The green curry portion was large, delicious, and the price was very reasonable. It doesn't come with Jasmine rice so you have to order it on the side.

Takeout was quick and the staff were courteous on the phone. The food was well-packaged so half your food doesn't end up at the bottom of the bag by the time you got home!"}
{"text":"Good food. Especially friendly staff and good service.
This is a place worth visiting if you are in the neighbourhood and need a bite."}
{"text":"Went there on a tuesday nite in a group of 13 people.

Ordered:

1) Mango Salad
2) Chillie Chicken
3) Basil Beef
4) Green Curry (Chicken)
5) Red Curry (Chicken)
6) Pad Thai
7) Tom Yum Soup

and bunch of other stuff.

The restaurant itself was clean and modern for a Scarborough Thai restaurant.  The food was pretty good, but then again, I've had better in Thailand ; ).

What made it a good experience was the staff was really friendly and very prompt, serving a party of 13 is not an easy task, but they were really fast on changing bowls/plates after our soup and appetizer course.

The chef even came out to say hello and to check on us and was asking for the feedback on his food - very classy service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are really friendly and attentive.My favorite is the Red Thai Curry vegetables. It is tastes so good. I have tasted Thai red curries in other restaurants and I find that they use too much coconut milk and it kills the taste. But this place, the red curry is perfect. It is loaded with flavour. The vegetables are nice and crunchy. I highly reccommend this place. The decor is also very nice too."}
{"text":"Called Yummy Garden. Hao wei Tsang kuan. Yummygarden.ca . I had wonton soup and pad Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Good Thai Food and Very Reasonable Prices :)))   The Staff were Very Friendly and the Service Great.  One of the Nicer Restaurants in the area of Scarborough  ... Which was quite a surprise ... a diamond in a rough one could say.  Will Most Definitely Come Again !!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since about 2007, the food at that time was simply astounding.  This is a small but very clean restaurant with a lovely d√©cor, great atmosphere and friendly staff.

However as of late, since about 2012, the quality has dropped dramatically.  The food has gone from fresh and flavourful, to bland and cookie-cutter. The Satay is consistently overcooked, and they don't let you know if they are out of the peanut sauce until it is served.  The curry is more sauce than curry.  The once beautiful Pad Thai is now smothered in sauce and lacking in flavour and ingredients.

They have also missed orders on their delivery service, though they haven't forgotten to charge for them!

In short, the love is gone, and so am I."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Scarborough!  Seriously, it is comparable to Satay on the Road in Leaside but as a Scarborough resident the location and free parking makes Lime Leaf a winner. Found out about this place from a coworker and haven't been back to Satay on the Road since. Friendly staff and really quick service. Best dishes include green curry chicken, crispy beef, mango salad, fresh spring rolls and pad thai."}
{"text":"Good food. Though the pad thai isn't anything to go on about, the rest of it is good. Try the chilli chicken on rice."}
{"text":"I love Specials.. Especially Lunch Specials...

Lime Leaf takes Specials to the max.. as not only you can get good specials during lunch, in fact they have ALL DAY SPECIALS!

Malay Mee Goreng with Spring Roll or Soup ($6.95)
- Spring roll was so good... freshly deep fried to just light golden brown.. crispy on the outside and steaming hot vegetables filling inside
- Mee Goreng is not bad... a little on the oily side...with a good mix of veggie..what lacking is some fresh chilli 
- I was trying to ask the waitress for some dried chili flakes to spice up the dish a little.. but she just pointed to the chili oil on the table.. oh ok! 

Thai Ice Tea ($2.50)
- Nice and refreshing... not overbearingly sweet... 

Good Value, Nice Deco... I definitely recommend giving Lime Leaf a try if you in the area... though it is not the best Thai/Malaysian restaurant in Toronto but good if you want something decent..."}
