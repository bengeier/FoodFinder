{"text":"I order take-out and delivery regularly; pizza is good, wings and gyros are good; hoagies are fantastic.  Service is fast and friendly. The family special is a great deal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had. Wings, salads, and other pizzas yummy as well. I agree with a previous yelper's comment that delivery is always around an hour, so I usually go pick up our order. 

My latest visit consisted of a large order, since some friends and family were helping us to do a major house project. I got one of their specials, which consisted of a large pizza, wings, and a 2 liter of pop. (that soda or coca-cola, for you non-Pittsburgh yelpers). I had a coupon for $5 off of my order. Well, upon my arrival I noted that my coupon was expired. I thought, what the heck, and asked the girl if I could use in anyways. She wasn't sure....but fortunately for me, the owner was near by and asked to see the coupon. He said unfortunately I couldn't use the coupon on specials, but initialed it and said that I could use it upon my next visit, even though it was expired. Thought that was very cool of him. We will continue to return!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good...definitely the closest option. Wish they would have a chix carbonera pizza like Vocellis. 

Subs are hit and miss. Strombolis are good. Fries are too.

Definitely do pickup if you can as delivery takes 1+ hour every time. Only place we've ever frequented that EVERY time you call they throw you on hold no matter the hour of the day."}
