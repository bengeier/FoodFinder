{"text":"Disappointed by Ambala.  The samosas were dry and tasteless, almost as though they had freezer burn.  The chicken tikka masala was incredibly sweet!  I've had chicken tikka masala at numerous other Indian restaurants, and this was far from the savory, aromatic meal I expected.  The dish could have been a dessert, its sugar taste was so overpowering.  On top of all of this, the meal was pretty expensive and took forever to arrive."}
{"text":"Les coups de coeur de la soirée sont le poulet au beurre qui est, selon leurs dires, le meilleur de la région, ainsi que les oignons bhagi. Leur pain Nan est également exquis. Le reste est honnête, sans plus.  Pour ce qui est du décor, il y aurait des efforts à mettre pour rafraîchir l'endroit, et la propreté pourrait aussi être amélioré. Le service était correct."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Tandoori platter through JustEat.ca from Ambala. One of the chicken tandoori legs was almost completely raw. It was as if they had Seared the edges on a grill and then not bothered to actually put it in a Tandoor?? Disgusting. Never, ever, ever order from these guys. Guy offered me a $5 credit from a $20 meal. Should be free for potentially giving me Salmonella poison. Here's an idea: If I go to hospital with dysentery, I'll send them my hospital bill. Avoid at ALL costs."}
{"text":"Small bring-your-own wine restaurant near a liquor store, Ambala looks unappealing restaurant at first sight: the facade is a tad dirty and the decoration is very bland.   Inside the restaurant, there is two sections: the dining room and the veranda. The veranda offers a view on St-Denis Street and is the best place to eat inside of the restaurant in my opinion.   The menu is a typical indian menu: typical indian food with nothing extravagant. I took the butter chicken with a daal soup and naan bread. First of all, the daal soup is nothing special, just a fill-you-up kind of soup. However, the lemon slices in the soup made the soup a bit more tastier: the lemon flavor enhanced the bitter taste of the lentil. The naan bread was fresh and hot from the kitchen but it tasted like normal naan bread: nothing out of the universe. The same could be said for the butter chicken. However, in my opinion, the butter chicken was lacking some kick: it was a bit lifeless and was not spicy at all. In short, the food was average but the price was cheap: 13$ for the soup, the bread and the chicken.   I will finish my review by saluting the service of the restaurant: the owner of the shop was friendly, warming and did a very good service."}
{"text":"Why oh why do I get Indian food outside of Parc Extension? Laziness, thriftiness, a sense that everybody deserves a chance and there could be a hidden gem out there.   I saw their menu in the mail and wanted to give them a chance. They've been open with same owners since '92,so they must be doing something right.  I went to pick up and it was quick service. The decor is not much and it's a bit worn out, (even Parc Ex Indian restos have stepped it up a notch in that aspect), but it was the  empty resto at lunch hour (except for a table of 3) that really threw me off.  The two good things about this place are the price and the huge selection (121 items including sides). You even get a discount for pick up.   On top of that there's a 1 person special, 1 shrimp bhoona, 1 chicken Masala, 1 Veggie Cari, with naan, rice, small salad, pakora, samosa and a small desert. All for under $20 tax included.  The bhoona was the biggest letdown, the shrimp were decent sized, but the sauce had no flavor whatsoever, it tasted like Indian frozen dinner in the sense that your taste buds just stop tasting halfway through.   The Masala (not tikka as the chicken was not grilled) was a bit better, but not by much. Big chunks of slightly dry chicken breast, but the real letdown was the sauce, it had the right texture and tasted freshly made, but was so sugary, they should be handing this out at Halloween. I normally love this dish elsewhere since it's butter chicken's meaner, tougher cousin, I dread to think how they make their butter chicken if this is what they put out as masala.  The vegetable curry was more of an aloo gobi, which is a can't miss, but here the veggies were stale and limp and had no taste.  The samosa was ok, except for the peas which were not cooked.  I asked for spicy when ordering and this was beyond mild, I know the clientele in this area is probably not looking for the hottest cuisine, but Rajasthan down the road can kick it up a notch if we ask them.    This would only be a good deal in terms of value and selection, most dishes are in the $10 range and the menu makes me drool because there's a lot of items that not too many places have. But, ill stick to my faves for the time being"}
{"text":"A wonderful small bring your own wine Indian restaurant located on St Denis. my friends and I always try to make it here for some fine modestly priced Indian food.  Daily specials, many, price fixed meals which include appetizer, entree, bread, and dessert and coffee. Decent prices here.   The service is friendly, fast, and efficient.  My mixed grill of Tandoori chicken, lamb, and chicken curry was wonderful.  All meals served with a small silver dish of basmati rice.   The restaurant is very easy to get to and very walkable from all areas.  Our table was next to the sidewalk, sub level and the windows open to for fresh air and see the cosmo party foot traffic on St Denis."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the worst Indian food I've ever had. It was cold and bland and get this: underneath the outside seasoning the tandoori chicken was completely raw. Not just a tiny bit, just to make you scared and question if it's ok; we're talking straight from the store uncooked! They gotta get there act together. Be careful (!) if I could I'd give this place zero stars I would. Just stay away."}
{"text":"Les plats sont généralement bons et leurs kormas ne sont jamais décevants. J'ai quand même eu une fois la mauvaise surprise d'un plat tellement épicé qu'il fallait le noyer dans le riz pour qu'il soit mangeable.  Nous prenons toujours à emporter dans ce restaurant et ils sont systématiquement très en retard sur l'horaire (déjà long) initialement annoncé. A force, nous avons arrêté d'y aller."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian curry, garlic naan, papadam, rice, a drink and extra sauce.  I received a chicken curry, two samosas, onion bhajis, a plain naan and rice.   That is a pretty monumental order fuck-up considering I'm vegetarian. The only thing that was the same was the rice!  It's not like I could have verified the order in front of the delivery guy! He handed me my receipt, and that was all correct, so I don't know what happened!   Fortunately, the food was really good...but it's not what I ordered. AND I'M VEGETARIAN SO I DON'T WANT A CHICKEN CURRY!  UPDATE: They mixed up the orders because of a mistake by the restaurant. The delivery guy was so apologetic and kind, but it sounded like the people at the restaurant were really angry at him for some reason!  They asked me to give the other one back, which I couldn't really do as I'd eaten some of it, but then they changed their mind.   Anyway! Now for a real review!   The food is great - generous portions, delicious sauce, very similar to curry in England (where I'm from).   The garlic naan has large chunks of garlic baked into it, which was daunting at first - but they're soft and warm and don't fall off when you pick it up like most garlic naan.   It was delivered super quickly and very hot, too! To their credit, once I called about the mistake it was rectified - though they didn't inform me that, they just hung up on me.   I might have had difficulty this time but I think I'll be coming here again - it's the nicest, most consistent curry I've had in Montreal other than Darbar on St Laurent.   Plus you can order extra sauce to dip your naan in! And now I have three naans!"}
{"text":"A nice casual bring your own wine Indian spot in the plateau. They have specials for 2 and the food was good. Twice I took an item on the tandoori table d'hôte and I have yet to regret it. The naan bread was great and huge!"}
{"text":"Ambala was a great meal! We chose a starter, which they didn't have, but they brought something else they recommended instead, which was amazing.  We both had the curry (chicken for me, and beef for my girlfriend) and she had hers mild and I had mine medium.  I definitely tasted the spices and the hotness in mine, and everything had a great flavor to it.  The waiters were a little hard to understand, but they were extremely polite and everything was executed accurately.  They seemed to get busier as the night went on and were always taking take-out orders over the phone (restaurant must be a popular one). The best thing about this restaurant is that it's a \"bring your own wine\" place!  We brought a nice bottle of wine and when we sat down, they took it from us and they brought it back with a wine-key and two glasses, opened and poured it for us. All-in-all we were very happy with our experience there at Ambala!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas pourquoi les gens disent que ce n'est pas un bon restaurant. Moi je le trouve succulent, et le propriétaire est très gentil. Il donne souvent de bons rabais. je vous conseille fortement le menu Calcuta. Vous en serez ravis....leur poulet au beurre est d'ailleurs le meilleur que j'ai mangé! Je recommande."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Naan bread wasn't fully cooked, nor did it taste good. The beef samosas were dry and too deep fried, and the beef curry wasn't anything special. Worst Indian food I have ever had."}
