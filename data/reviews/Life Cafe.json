{"text":"The food here is okay.. I'm vegan so I got the black bean burger on a salad and the burger was not nearly as good as the frozen ones I eat at home. It was kind of bland. Usually takes a while to receive food and I noticed almost everything is pretty high in calories even salad with no protein. Otherwise quick option at lifetime, I like the premade foods in the cooler."}
{"text":"The food here is so-so. Nothing is great. Healthy indeed. If you like warm meat with your salad you have to ask them to warm it when you order. Otherwise, everything is straight out from fridge. Honestly, I've had better salad at McDonald. I wouldn't get the food here unless I'm stuck waiting around. Price wise? Affordable, if not a lil much. A bed of salad without meat can be $5-6 alone."}
{"text":"double check your plates they serve you. Its been more than once that my plate has been covered in old food from the previous dish. Foul. The food is good i'll tell you that. But the prices are ridiculous..."}
{"text":"If you're like me, and live at the health club, you know how crucial it is to have a good \"go to\" cafe.  I happen to be on an extremely strict eating plan, so smoothies are a staple. Life Cafe makes the best smoothie in town. I opt for their proprietary \"Fast Fuel Optimizer-Vanilla Lite,\" with peanut butter, banana, and water.  I'm not sure why most places have trouble getting the consistency right, but LC nails it every time. The wraps and sandwiches are fantastic, too. Kids will have no problem here, as they have everything from pizza to chicken nuggets to mac 'n cheese. I'm getting hungry. See ya!"}
{"text":"I love the gym however the food service here is very bad.  It's super super slow and the food isn't that great.  One time I had to wait 30 minutes for a egg sandwich I was planning on eating while my daughter was in swim class. I had to tell them after 20 min I was still waiting for my food and I needed to go back and get my daughter. 5 min later still food wasn't here. Then about 5 min left, I told one guy to pack it to go because it took too long. Guess what, they brought it out on a plate and I'm telling them my daughter is done with class. I basically went to go pick up my daughter and then came back for the food because I couldn't wait for them any longer.  Each swim class is 30min. I ordered right after I dropped her off before her class. I hate having to order here but there is nowhere else to go....   Sorry I love lifetime but please improve the staff or the food prep time for an egg sandwich.    This actually happened back in April but just seeing the line today made me post."}
{"text":"One word for this place. SLOW. If you are in a hurry, do not come here. Slow and unprofessional. Always only two people working. I waiting in line for 15 minutes and there was only one person in front of me. Might as well go to whole paycheck across the street.. Same price and will be quicker. Not happy with the service."}
{"text":"Life Cafe is full of yummy, healthy options after your workout.  My typical routine is to grab a smoothie after my morning workout and before heading to work.  I've been know to grab a breakfast wrap now and then too.  The service is friendly.  Sometimes a little slow, but hey, healthy fresh food takes time.  A great option for breakfast or lunch!  Bring the kids, spend the day at the pool and grab a bite - make a day out of it!  You all had fun, they're tired and full and all it one place!"}
{"text":"Ok so I swore I'd never come back here again after my horrible experience with the wilted pre-made salad they insisted on giving me rather than making me a new one when I asked. However, I had just gotten done with a 2 hour cardio workout and I was famished so I decided to let bygones be bygones. And I'm really glad I did. My first test was to have a look at the salads they had out and they looked considerably fresher than when I wrote my first review. That made me feel confident enough to place an order. I ended up getting the Caprese Panini (pictured) which was really good. Service was accommodating. Overall, I was impressed so I've decided to end my long grudge against this place, after all, it's HEALTHY to do so and they earned my respect back. Just wanted to clear the air about Life Cafe."}
{"text":"Yum, very yum! They have options of good sustainable food and very health conscious choices. They also make smoothies that can be dairy and whey free. They cater to food allergies and gluten intolerance. They offer vegan and vegetarian options too. The only problem I have here is spending too much money! It is a little pricey for a family of three to have lunch. But, we still buy it so it obviously does not deter me too much from eating here."}
{"text":"Located inside Lifetime Fitness in Summerlin, Life Cafe is a decent spot to grab a quick bite while you're at the gym. They have a pretty large menu for a gym cafe that consists mostly of salads, sandwiches/wraps, and smoothies. You can order off the menu or just purchase from their grab and go fridge where they have drinks and premade salads and sandwiches.  The curry chicken wrap I had was pretty good and surprisingly had a great curry flavor. However, the rice was way undercooked and was kind of hard...looks to me like they probably don't have a rice cooker on site. The wrap came with a \"seasonal side\" which turned out to be a small side salad covered in quinoa. The salad was tasty and made me feel healthy after a good work out.  The pricing is pretty reasonable considering that they're located inside a gym. The curry wrap I had was around 8 or 9 bucks. I would return if I was hungry while at the gym again in the future but it probably wouldn't be worth a separate trip down"}
{"text":"LifeCafe is a great perk to being a lifetime member.  The food is fresh, healthy and prepared relatively quick.  Life Café offers a nice variety of menu options from smoothies, breakfast, snacks, lunch/dinner to small kid's plates and vegetarian options. All the nutrition facts are listed for each item on the menu.   Another bonus is they have specials everyday:  $2 - Snack $3 - Breakfast (Huevos wrap is my favorite) $4- smoothie  $5 - Meal (Mostly sandwiches and wraps) In addition to food, they sell all the gym supplies you may have forgotten to put in your bag...socks, swim caps, weight gloves, tennis balls, etc... and free wireless access.   I'm not sure if you can get into the café if you're not a gym member, as it is passed the check-in point."}
{"text":"Good low cal smoothie. Very nice salads.  Kids love it too!"}
{"text":"I thought I would try this place because it was healthy. Mistake. I ordered a salad with fish. The fish was so far from fresh, I couldn't eat it. I have had better salads from Wendy's. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This evening was my first night back to lifetime cafe in several years ...   First impression:  a bit confused I asked the gentleman working behind the counter if breakfast was served all day, and he responded by telling me they had already shut down the ovens for the day (and this was @ 6:30, and they didn't close till 7:00) so you say the cafe is open until 7:00, but people can't order food?  The worker told me that I could only order a shake or a prepackaged food to go ...   I am also not a huge fan of all the changes that have been made to the menu - I prefer some consistency, especially regarding some of my favorite items that used to be offered here.  I ended up trying the bodybuilder shake with chocolate flavoring and peanut butter & banana ... It was good, but I wa disappointed that I was not able to order actual food, and last time I talked to a manger about this very same issue he explained to me that they are not supposed to shut down the grill/oven early (they are supposed to wait until close) .... Sooooo ????   I used to like coming here, but not if things close down early and I can't rely on the listed open hours ... I have seen this issue with lifetime workers before ... trying to close down the cafe early and refusing to make members food during the open hours.  This has seriously got to stop.  I hope the management sees this review and takes care of this issue because the cafe not only loses out on sales, but it's frustrating/annoying as a member to deal with lazy workers who just want to get out of work right on time instead of doing their job.   The prices here are moderate, and as I mentioned in this post ... Staff here can be hit or miss.  Sometimes they are good and great, other times they are nice, but slackers deep down ...  The facility itself is very nice - clean, comfortable, and offers plenty of options when workers aren't claiming that its policy to turn off ovens/grills waaay prior to closing time ...   I will try it out again to see if this issue has been resolved ... Be on the look out for my update ;)"}
{"text":"How can a cafe inside a gym not offer skim milk instead of 2%? Breakfasts are very good"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place after a work out. I eat here roughly 3-4 times a week and I'm never disappointed. I've tried several sandwiches, wraps and salads and have liked all of them. Especially the salmon salad. I also really like how they put the dressings for the salads on the side.   Everyone that works here is also very pleasant. I could do without the kids that usually fill up the place but that's about the only bad thing I could say."}
{"text":"Really a convenient option on the days that I am too tired to cook/clean up dinner for the kids.  The food is obviously healthy, fresh, and can be made your way.  There is a large variety of different proteins to go along with smoothies, cottage cheese, salads, salmon, eggs, etc.  A huge plus is they have soy milk.  If you workout early, breakfast is also available, and pretty wide ranging also with many choices.  Service is always super friendly.   Why the four stars? A bit bland.  Also, the espresso drinks are sometimes a miss depending on the barista that day."}
{"text":"Life Cafe is located inside of the Life Time Athletic. They have premade meals in the side display cases that you can either take to-go, or have them microwave for you. The stock varies, sometimes they have what you want, sometimes they don't. The prices are fairly reasonable and the food is mostly healthy. I like that the main board shows the calories, protein, etc for the different meals to help you choose what fits your diet plan. If they are short staffed, there may be a wait to place your order and for it to be delivered. The food has always been good. If you need to eat before or after your workout, its a quick and convenient option. They have free Wifi, so you can get some work done on the couches in front of the TV after your meal."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Life Cafe. The staff is ever so friendly and the shakes are great.   I usually pop in Life Cafe for a healthy lunch after my 9:45 butt-kicking with James (Barbell Strength on Fridays). The FastFuel Complete is amazing and full of protein.   Oh, did I mention that each menu item lists its total calories, protein, carb, and fat content right next to the price? Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great food for the health oriented.  And right at the gym.   WiFi as well and I go there to work during the day. Pizza was good but salads are great."}
{"text":"A place within the Lifetime Fitness gym to grab a bite to eat before or after working out. They have plenty of smoothie options as well as burgers, wraps, salads, bowls and even pizza. I believe that all of their bread is gluten free. The calorie content and basic nutritional stats are right there on the menu which is nice. I haven't been too impressed with anything I have ordered but it will do in a pinch.  This is also where Lifetime sells their own branded merchandise like water bottles and such. They also sell protein powders and other supplements. The prices are pretty high but you do get a discount if you mention the name of a trainer or nutritionist who works there at the gym that you may be working with."}
{"text":"Some of the food here is a hit or miss but most of the time I order it's pretty good. Sometimes the wait is a bit long but there's not that many people working back there and each dish is made as soon as it's ordered. The Chipotle Southwest Quesadilla is amazing! It's not on the menu but it's a special and the cilantro sauce that it comes with is very good! The blueberry muffins are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Yoooooooooooooooooooooo! Lifetime Cafe is the Shiznit. Jack and Jill went up the hill for Will we made a deal that can only be described as excellent customer service for real.  So I came inside the greatest cafe in gym history as always do after my workout. And they didn't have my favorite protein drink in the fridge. I knew they had my drink in the vending machine but the vending machine is malfunctioning. The language on the screen is in Japanese right now???? After I cried a little bit I saw Jodi and she said hey why don't you just ask the cafe to pull one out of the vending machine. And then my teary frown turned into a big smile like Brobee from Yo Gabba Gabba. So I went back to the cafe and Jack and Jill was like yo Will we got you and then we gave each other a million high fives like Mordecai and Rigby. What a great Monday so far."}
{"text":"I'd be at this place all the time even if it weren't located inside my favorite gym. Healthy, fresh, low calorie, low fat breakfasts, lunches, smoothies, etc. Every menu item shows calorie content, fat content, protein, carbs, etc - and they keep it low. The staff - every last one of them - is unfailing upbeat and friendly.  Did I mention how tasty everything is?"}
{"text":"I'm a regular.  Fresh and healthy food.  Fair selection.  Nice place nestled inside of Life Time Fitness.  They have daily specials so be sure to check the chalk board!"}
{"text":"I have been here more than I care to admit because I workout in the evening.  I enjoyed dinner here with friends or solo and love their smoothies for a quick refuel of 20g of protein. I try not to make the smoothies a habit because the prices are not affordable unless you get  them on sale that day.   I have tried the black bean burger, turkey sandwiches, salads, and my favorite smoothie is the mocha madness and banana granola both Amazing.  I love the open and chill atmosphere. Many healthy options!"}
{"text":"Minus one star for not yet naming a smoothie after me. Minus another star for charging me four bucks if I order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich off of the kids menu for myself. This same PB&J would be only three dollars if it was, in fact, for my kid. And ... AND it would come with a bag of Sun Chips and a juice box! So not only am I paying a dollar more, but I am rendered chipless and juice boxless! \"Why?\" I ask. WHHHHHYYYYYY!?!?!?!  Are those of without offspring and who crave pre- or post-workout PB&J's being discriminated against simply because we've chosen not to spread our seed just yet? Seems cruel.  The dollar (as well as the Sun Chips and the Juicy Juice) is important to me. On more than one occasion, I have considered borrowing a toddler from elsewhere in the fitness club so as to get the \"good deal\" on the samich, but I can never make it past the gals working the front desk in the playroom. Those of you with small children may find comfort in knowing that they take their jobs - and your little ones - very seriously at the child care center at Lifetime Fitness (a review of which is likely forthcoming). But back to the café ...  I'm pretty bent about the PB&J deal, and I've yet to find a work-around. But I'm giving a star back because the people working the joint are always very nice and the place is well done for a café in a fitness club. It really is. Great overall selection, including smoothies, burritos, salads, pizzas, wraps and, of course, a kids menu. They make most everything to order, but also have some grab-and-go items if you're in a hurry.  In short, Life Café is all that and a bag of chips. (As long as you're 12 or under)."}
{"text":"If you're here you're eating healthy. Depending on who's working, sometimes the food can take forever to get to you."}
