{"text":"Great service but food not good at all (frozen or processed?). Expensive for poor quality of food tho"}
{"text":"I have been to this Chinese restaurant a number of times through the past few years. I was shocked to see some highly negative comments. We\"ve found this place to consistantly serve some of the best Chinese around this area. Fresh ingredients of top quality, properly flavored and excellently prepared."}
{"text":"There's no way this place got 3 stars. The food was just not good. Soggy chicken, sweet & \"sour\" was basically icing, fried rice was super bland with no veggies or anything. So disappointed. I really hope Phoenix can get it together with Chinese food. It's one of my favorite cuisines"}
{"text":"Dissapointing and over priced. Usually your typical afternoon Chinese takeout, great for packing days or lazy Saturdays, however our last visit left something to be desired. Since many of their menu items come premade, waiting time for a meal should be fairly short. We waited for an hour for our meal, and ended up asking for it to go. Once home the forty dollar dinner was a total waste. The orange chicken is soggy and obviously store bought. The other entrees, egg foo young and Mongolian beef were bland and reminiscent of the frozen food section at the local grocery store. The patties in the egg foo young are small and the dish only included peas and carrots for vegetables. The mongolian beef had little flavor besides black pepper. For the price I am dissapointed. I doubt we will eat there again."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Great food! Nice staff! My fave is the garlic chicken. Sweet and sour sauce is delicious. Great salad dressing too. Cheap lunch specials. Been going here for years. Definitely the best in this area."}
{"text":"I just read through all the reviews and I'm shocked.  I have tried every Asian food place in Surprise and this is the only one that has outstanding food.  You will never find better mongolian beef.  I know that because I've tried them all.  The beef melts in your mouth.  The egg foo young is delicious and has tons of chicken on top.  The moo shu pork is delicious with the plum sauce.  The only thing we don't like is the atmosphere.  It's always just one or two tables that are occupied, if that.  I guess most people get take out or delivery.  If you love Chinese like I do, please try some of their lunch specials and I'll bet you find a dish you love."}
{"text":"Horrible!! They don't even deserve 1 star.. I came across this restaurant on Google, after doing some research. I realized they were opened for about 3 hours or so, and I decided to call and order. I was greeted by an older lady, she asked if it was pickup or delivery. When I told her it was for delivery, she proceeded to ask for my address. After I gave her my unit number, she told me that she couldn't deliver, because it was an apartment and it would be too dark. It's actually a house with a unit number, which I explained. She still didn't want to deliver, she said it would take 2 hours and unless I wanted to wait that long, than I would have to pickup. I wanted delivery because I didn't have any means of transportation. So for that reason I am rating 0 stars. I'm not saying this is the worst place of all as I have never tried the food. I'm not saying everyone there lacks customer service, just that specific person who denied delivery."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly staff that insults people and food is disgusting I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to eat here."}
{"text":"Smelled horrible in this place.
There was a cook or waiter sleeping on one of the booths.
Food was solid but nothing special."}
{"text":"The owners are some of the nicest people you could ever meet.  The food is always excellent.  My favorite is the Chicken Curry and the Singapore Noodles.  Both are on the spicy hot side but you can ask for mild if hot isn't your thing.  They always want to accommodate the customer."}
{"text":"Stoped in for lunch following church. I had sweet and sour chicken,salad, egg roll and a fortune cookie. All for  $7.00,a terriffic deal. Place was spotless. Server was great and entertaining. Food was fresh and very tasty. I loved the salad. All was a little lighter (tasting) and sweeter,pleasantly surprised.  No MSGs.Wonderful place.
Right next Ace on Bell rd. In Surprise."}
{"text":"Will not be back here ! Gave two stars cause the lady was honest with me. I asked how I can get some traditional Chinese food she replied give her two weeks notice to get the food. She said all the stuff they get is ordered in and it's american Chinese food. What they have is all frozen and not great. Better off saving money and getting Walmart brand frozen Chinese food"}
{"text":"Order the lunch special the food was average nothing special I've been to quite a few Chinese restaurants in the valley don't get the hype on this one appreciate all the responses but can agree with most of them."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I called by phone to order food and I said twice I couldn't understand you and they hung up on me. I called back and the same person answered and continued to yell at me, now this whole time I was polite and understanding and just wanted some orange chicken... Never got my chicken."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the service was like being in Red China.  They charged me for extra chow mien noodles ($1.25).  I did comment to the wait staff that I was suprised chow noodles were so expensive.  I would have had a better time going to a panda express."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. I am now at home sitting across from my husband watching him spit out his orange chicken. I ordered the human beef which is just as palatable as my husband's dish. The BBQ pork appetizer was chewy... I'm sure it's similar to eating a large rubber band. Nothing fresh about the food there. If we actually ate at this establishment, we would have taken our first bite and asked for a refund. Disgusting. Waste of $30."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday night and was one of two tables at 6 PM. Take out business seemed very brisk. Service was very attentive. When my husband requested fried rice, the server actually suggested a combo platter which was cheaper than the way he was originally going to order. Orange chicken was good and certainly good value for the price charged. Would rate 3.5"}
{"text":"Just finished eating there. Had the Szechwan garlic chicken and the Shrimp lo mein. Delicious, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Save your time, money, and happy state of mind.  Otherwise all will be compromise with a meal here.  I'll admit being from the bay area and accustomed to excellent Chinese (well all Asian food for that matter) restaurants that I have innumerable great experiences to compare this to.   It's over priced to add insult to this mediocre fare."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly delivery, but not the best food. Family complained food is too greasy and fatty.  But not horrible, just average."}
{"text":"This was the worst Christmas meal...my kids and I had nowhere to go so I wanted a nice meal for them...ordered delivery at 3:40..was told it would be here in 45 min...called an hour later...they said were very busy it will be there in a few min...I was like ok no problem it's Christmas...another hour later I called they said it's still there so to come get it......needless to say it was cold by the time we ate and the teriyaki chicken was definitely not that"}
{"text":"Great food! Delivery was quick and I was yelled at by the delivery lady because my doorbell didn't work and she didn't think to KNOCK. So she had to walk ALL the way back to her car to call me to answer the door. I couldn't believe she spoke to me like that but the food was great! Next time I will pick it up myself since apparently common sense and decency is hard to come by these days."}
{"text":"I stopped in for take out last night and what a surprise. I checked out some of the bad reviews here a few months ago and just figured that I would stay away from this joint. 
As it was , I stopped in because my family needed food that wasn't pizza and this place was just down the street (any port in a storm). 
The food came so quickly, I thought for a moment that this was going to be some kind of microwave prepped dish.  It was standard Chinese fare but far better than what I've been reading here.  I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the Golden Wei for 15 years,  generally take out for dinner or simply for  lunch in the restaurant. It's a  small  Chinese restaurant located in a plaza on the West  side of Surprise on Bell Road. It's also  locally owned, not a franchise.  Nice place, nice people  and good food.  Dishes are made fresh prior to serving, unlike Chinese buffets in which the various items have been sitting around for  who knows how long. The Golden Wei has always been the friendly little Chinese restaurant less than a mile from my home. Don't go there looking for fancy, expensive PF Chang  gourmet dishes. However,  you will enjoy this delightful local restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was bland and overpriced only good thing is the rice. Save yourself extra few bucks and head some place else"}
{"text":"Family run business. Meal presentation was so-so. Hot and Sour soup was not good. Entrees were average. Owner was very loud on phone when taking to go orders."}
{"text":"Food was horrible! Bland beef lo mein and nasty dry fried rice. I was the only one in the whole place and still waited like 10 mins to be acknowledged because the 2 women felt the need to continue their conversation. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Golden Wei knows Chinese food.  I think their location doesn't serve them well because the area is very quiet but they serve authentic Chinese food and not the Americanized version.  I called in for a Take-out order and it was ready before I could get there.  If your palate tends to crave the dollar menu you most likely would not appreciate the true cultural flavors.  However this is the best Chinese food in Surprise and they need support. You will have good food and they stay in business.  It gives you a taste of China without packing your bags for the flight.  (And yes, I've had dinner in China.)  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place to have in Surprise! Everyone was super friendly and the restaurant was clean. We had the orange chicken, lemon chicken, and lo mein. All very good and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is amazingly crafted with authentic flavors. They never disappoint. Large portions and they deliver!!! Staff are polite and courteous."}
{"text":"WTF was that? It is the worst Chinese food I have had in years. Really bad. Very little flavor and poorly prepared. Take it from a professional Chef....it is awful."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot. Best Chinese food we have found in the area. Friendly staff, they remember us whenever we come in to eat or get food to go. Decent size portions and a good price."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings. I called in my order for a delivery and after going through what I wanted, giving my address, phone number and credit card number THEN the lady tells me it will be an hour and a half. My whole family is sick, including myself, but I was told if I came and picked it up it would be ready when I got there. The food was good. The thing that really ticked me off though was the teenage boy who took my payment and got my food never took his earbuds out of his ears....so rude. The customer service could use some help for sure."}
{"text":"I have been ordering very often from them for years. I have endured the annoying telephone conversations and the occasional mistake because the food is decent enough. They have a 20.00 minimum for delivery. I usually order over 30.00 worth of food. I tip well (never below 30%). Tonight I just wanted two entrees that cost 8.95 and 9.95, a sum total of 18.90. I know the tax puts it over 20.00. She says to me, \"I know you get delivery all the time. You know it is a minimum of 20.00 for delivery.\" She was rude about it and to be honest I was surprised since I knew it was with taxes and I've been a very loyal customer for years. I told her to add two egg rolls. She then tells me it's $28 and some change. When I ask why she says because of the delivery charge and taxes. 

Apparently business is booming. Lost a customer over $1.10. Strong work..."}
{"text":"It's Chinese food, but nothing special.  Food quality was OK, service was so-so.  For a better deal, check out out the Chinese Buffet at Litchfield and Bell.  For the same price, you get better food and it's all you can eat."}
{"text":"Food is normally good. But got a pick up today and the soup tasted racid the egg fo young was flavorless. I don't know whats going on if the changed product but never again will i  go back $35 into the trash."}
{"text":"Overall good Chinese americanized restaurant.  I like their tofu with vegetables dish.  Their hot & sour soup is nice too.  

My mom enjoyed their orange beef & thought it was delicious.  It looked good."}
{"text":"I'm surprised about any negative reviews. I've been going to the Golden Wei for 6 years and I have never gotten a bad order. It's all about the food, for me, and their food is great. My husband orders either the Chow Fun or the Lo Mein and I almost always get the vegetable fried rice with chicken. Never have I been disappointed. The service is excellent. Jenny, the owner, always makes a point of stopping by our table and shares bits and pieces about her children and friends. I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else for Chinese food."}
{"text":"We either go or take out from Golden Wei at least once a week.  Jennie and Andy know us by name. They have a delightful daughter Aimee that works on occasion when home from college and their high school aged son works on occasion.

We usually order the shrimp sizzling rice soup. The vegetable in the soup are fresh and perfectly blanched. We have ordered many dishes on the list.  Once I ordered General Tao's Chicken, which was not on the menu then (it is now). They made it for me. 

Once I was there late afternoon and the family and crew were eating authentic Chinese food. They had a soup that was not on the menu and some other dishes. Being that I have been to China 3 times this was great.  I asked them to make Lánzh?u beef noodle soup.  They are from Canton, so they don't know all the cuisines.

The food is very Americanized Chinese food. The chicken and beef is always very tender. The shrimp are large and plump. 

It is a very nice family place.  It is usually a quiet place unless there is a large group in there.  We have ordered large take out meals and their party platters too."}
{"text":"This is really good Chinese food! I would definitely recommend to friends. The food is hot, fresh and very delicious. Very fast delivery told me 40 minute's they were at my door within 15 - 20min. Great customer service excellent food you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty basic Chinese food place with no frills. I do like that they deliver but I rather drive a mile south and pick up superior food. I've ordered here a few times because I was in the area and each time the place was pretty empty. The owners/staff are polite. The layout is like every other American Chinese restaurant out there. They have no stand out dishes to me but it was all okay. The place is not bad but it is not the best place in West Surprise. The best thing about this Chinese restaurant are the prices."}
{"text":"Best miso beef ever great service and quick. I always offer moso beef, chicken or pork with cc plum sauce and crepes brest evebest ever and Andy the best..... unum"}
{"text":"The food was really good the atmosphere was great and the the service to I ate my fill"}
{"text":"Decent food at a fair price.  The hot and sour soup is really good.  Their egg rolls are HORRIBLE though.  The service is so-so and a little slow.  It's average as far as strip mall Chinese restaurants go."}
{"text":"I was at The hardware store when the daughter asked to pick up some lunch. Well the Golden Wei was just a few doors down. Originally from Long Beach Ca. The Golden Wei is just an basic Chinese food joint. Nothing really special, we ordered the orange chicken, Mongolian beef, white rice, and noodles. I thought the orange chicken was really good, the noodles was OK. Daughter thought the beef was pretty good. Listen, if we wanted really good take out! We will go to the local Pei Wei! The Golden Wei is not that bad! But it's not great either!!"}
{"text":"Where I live the best Chinese food is Panda Express, Golden Wei is better than PE, but not San Francisco good. I have eaten here several times, for me the location and parking are easy. The staff is friendly, service has always been good and the food is good, not great. When an item is listed as spicy I'd like it to have a little kick. I would also like the sauces to be less thick, not so like gravy, but the flavor is good. I like the place and will return."}
{"text":"We have been looking for decent Chinese food and found a nice gem.....a little hidden but we found it. 
Pork with garlic szechuan..and Hunan beef....both good. We will be back...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. I always get the teriyaki chicken which is great every time. The sauce has a wonderful flavor to it. They have really awesome lunch prices."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, not the greatest. Spring rolls and wontons are way too hard, like leftovers from yesterday."}
{"text":"This was undoubtedly one of the worst dining experiences I have encountered in quite some time.  I'm not sure which was worse, the service or the food.  We ordered egg foo yung, hot and sour soup, and mongolian beef, and everything was tasteless.  On top of that, the presentation was very bad.  The egg foo yung was three tiny silver dollar-sized omelets covered in brown gravy and a very unappetizing looking display of pork slices.  I could not eat it.  The hot and sour soup was very bad, and the mongolian beef was barely passable.  

Our server was completely disinterested in giving us any kind of service, and simply rushed us at our table.  I had to ask for everything... noodles for our soup (a small amount was offered to me for which they charged me), hot mustard, water, everything.   

When I mentioned our dissatisfaction upon leaving, they didn't even seem to care.

Go somewhere else.  This place is terrible.  If you want really good Chinese food in the Surprise area, go to Big Buddha near the corner of 303 and Greenway.  Excellent food and friendly service from people who seem to care.

We know good food when we eat it, and this was anything but good.  If Golden Wei were the only Chinese restaurant in the entire state, I still wouldn't go back there.  The other couple that was with us felt the same way as well."}
{"text":"$20 minimum order. Didn't even get to place my order since my total would have only been about $10 since it's just me. Maybe next time when I have the whole family home we will try to go there!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. Today it deserves my good review. If you want real authentic Chinese food Golden Wei will deliver. I went for lunch and had Chicken Chow Fun and Fried Gyoza. It was outstanding. The price is even better. Attentive service, clean and spacious. Perfect for big group. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out many times but have always just gone in and taken it home. The food is always really well prepared although the portions could be a bit larger. The meat is very good quality and the veggies really fresh.  The staff in the restaurant is always very friendly. Today we called in and ordered delivery. Their phones were very busy and I was often put on hold for a few minutes it was 7pm on a Friday night afterall. However the lady on the phone was very polite and answered all of my questions without rushing me. Once the order was complete she said it would be about 40 minutes for delivery. To my surprise, 20 minutes later my doorbell rang and the sweetest lady was there with our order. I think the food was even warmer than when we get it ourselves and bring it home. Yes there is a minimum order of $20 for delivery but as a family of 7, we easily pass that. We will certainly be ordering delivery everytime I want good chinese food and don't want to bother to put on pants to get it."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise in Surprise! I had been to a few Chinese joints and was scared by reviews of other places. I wanted a good Chinese restraunt that offered delivery. The food was delivered promptly and very fresh and delicious.The sauces were not too salty,oily,sweet or too spicy. I ordered full dinners for 4 people soup,appetizers,fried rice and main entree. A small inconvenient fact is they forgot my small steamed rice I ordered for my Daughter but I made her something at home instead.I found my new place within a reasonable price range,so no more long drives to Glendale .Trust me, coming from a picky eater this says a lot."}
{"text":"GUT BOMB!!!!!! 
Both the wife and I felt like crap after eating here. It took a good two hours to get back to feeling like ourselves. Not sure what is in the food, maybe just too greasy, but it made us both lethargic and yucky feeling."}
{"text":"Back again and brought friends this time. Another great meal. Friends loved it also. Very friendly staff. Had orange chicken, one of the 4 dinner specials, whole meal for $8.99 included hot tea. GREAT VALUE. They also have other specials. GREAT place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after pedis next door at Estrella. Place was empty and we were promptly met and told to have a seat, while our server took drink orders and gave us our menus. Lunch special of the BBQ Pork Chow Fun was so good! Came with the best egg drop soup I've ever had. My daughter had Orange Chicken and rice and it was ok- not bad, just ok. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go on a motorcycle ride and knew about where I wanted to stop for lunch so I yelped the Zip code for \"lunch\".  This was one of the places that showed up. Folks that have dined with me several times know I do not care for booths, I just don't like sinking into the average booth where quite often the table feels too high in relation to the seat. As I walked in the door the waitress at the back of the room held up her index finger asking if I was a party of one. I nodded my head and she pointed towards a booth. I could tell looking at her that asking for a different seating choice in her restaurant would not go well. To my pleasant surprise the booth had nice firm seats and the relationship of the table to the seat was very good. I had a lunch special which came with appetizers and was a very generous portion for the price. The service was good. I would certainly consider going back if I was again in the area."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience, fast and polite service from the employees. Amazing food. A great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"delivery was fast. Spent $75 and everything was delicious ( except the pot stickers that were a bit dry)"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time Friday evening. We were greeted and seated right away.  I asked about the nightly special and was shown a card with the specials they have all the time. My husband and I both ordered one of the specials. It started with an ok egg roll and a crab angel that tasted like just cream cheese inside a fried wonton. No crab could be tasted. Our entrees arrived piping hot and very presentable. Unfortunately the food was not good. The orange chicken I had was tough and so salty I could not eat it. The fried rice was good.  Next time we want Chinese food we will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Jenni and her staff are great. It's a family owned restaurant and I think that is awesome! The service is friendly and the food is always great! We have been there ever since it opened and everyone has always been attentive and kind."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I had the Kung Pao Chicken and my husband had the Orange Chicken. This is the best Chinese food we've had since we moved to Arizona and we've tried A LOT of different places! It's authentic and the service is spectacular."}
{"text":"Called them just before 3 pm to get delivery for a family of 5. They said lunch was over and obviously didn't need the $40 I spent at a local Chinese place farther away who took my lunch order at 3:02."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!! We did takeout and it was the only time in my life that I actually tried to eat somthing and had to throw it all away."}
{"text":"Golden Wei is way better than those fast food Chinese places. Not a fancy place, but some where you can go and sit down and be casual if you don't happen to live within their delivery range. The staff greeted us and were happy to have the business. I believe the owner even came out and greeted us at one point. We started off with their Wor Won Ton Soup, got the large and for 3 people we all got a full serving and had remaining soup, it was flavorful and packed with Won Tons and shrimp. Must be made fresh daily or in several small batches throughout the day. Won Ton's were not mushy or falling apart, veggies were cooked but still had some bite to them. We moved on to our main course, first was the Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp, always a favorite and they did not miss the mark. Next was the Broccoli Beef, had good flavor and was of good consistency not rubbery, Followed by Sweet and Sour Pork which had a great crispness to it and the sauce we could tell was house made not something from a jar or can. The Orange Flavor Chicken was a little over done, not burned, but was deep fried a little long, but it still had good flavor. When we were here one other couple came in and the place was not very busy. The entire parking lot was a ghost town, next time your thinking Chinese try Golden Wei instead of Panda Express or a greasy buffet."}
{"text":"This is a friendly place and not expensive. The food is really good I wouldn't say the best but better then what you pay!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. I've been coming here for years. Best Chinese food in the area. Owners are fantastic people and always come and say hello to my kids and I."}
{"text":"I don't know how I missed finishing my review here. I love Chinese food almost as much as I love pizza, and have been dying to find the best Chinese food in the west valley with no real luck. There are a few that are pretty good, but can't say much more. We tried Golden Wei as a family for dinner and right away I was kinda disappointed. The menu wasn't anything special and service was lacking. Not very friendly and our food took what felt like forever. The restaurant was empty and there was only one other couple inside. I hate leaving less than a five star review anywhere I go, but the flavors were so bland and I'd never come back. None of my family finished their food or took the remaining to go. This was not the place for us."}
{"text":"Jenni  and her staff are wonderful.
The food is always good and she can make it as hot and spicy as you want and can handle. I love this place."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had. The food didn't have much taste. I recommend Big Buddha off of Greenaway and the 303"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone else is eating, but this was by far my worst Chinese experience I've ever had. Spent well over $30 and it's almost all in the garbage. The Kung Pao Chicken tastes like dirty feet. All of the breading fell off of the orange chicken. And there was more water chestnuts than noodle in our lo mein. Not to mention we were supposed to get 10 wontons and only got 6 which was the only semi decent thing that we had. Not worth the money. Not worth the drive. ALSO to top it off... I'm pregnant and Chinese was all I wanted. I could almost cry. I'd take it all back but we all know how that works out. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We have been numerous times and have always had good food and quick, pleasant service. While the serving sizes may be smaller than other local Chinese food restaurants, the food here tastes so much better. I am one who prefers quality to quantity. So happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Delivery is really fast, the staff are always friendly, and the egg fried rice is absolutely to die for! It's my favorite place for fried rice in town."}
{"text":"First time this place opened, it was disappointing. The food was good but each order of dinner entree were only enough for 2 people whereas other places like Good China and Big Buddha make theirs good for 3-4 people. Went there a couple of times and never came back. Until...

Recently, I have ordered off of their lunch menu. It didn't disappoint this time. My orders where the shrimp in lobster sauce, rock cod fillets with black bean sauce and orange flavored beef. I did that several times with different variations and I was satisfied. I also went ahead and ordered several dinner items, such as the salt and pepper  rock cod fillets and sesame chicken. No complaints. 

I also have to agree with another \"Yelper\" who complained of not having a variety of vegetable entrees like bok choy. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"My first experience with this restaurant was when I ordered a meal to take away. While I'm standing there waiting I was witness to the owner woman berating a poor customer who had the audacity to criticize her meal. The patron seemed nice enough, just did not enjoy her meal, she never raised her voice, did not refuse to pay or even ask for another meal. That did not stop the owner from yelling at the customer, telling her she does not know what she is talking about and everyone loves her food and she can just leave. I was mortified for her. At one point the customers husband went outside and sat in his car. I think it was the smartest thing to do, I don't know what I would have done in his shoes, but it would not have been nice or quiet. I think I'll steer clear."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a regular. I've been going to this Chinese restaurant since 2014. The foods is always good. I don't have to wait too long for the food to be ready. They also do deliver with a minimum of $20 dollars and a 5 Mi radius."}
{"text":"Just moved here and while shopping at  bed bath and beyond I asked the sales clerk where I can get some yummy Chinese food. She recommended Golden Wei. So hungry from all our running around, trying to get our new home in order, we stopped in for a to go order, got home to eat the Chinese food that we were so psyched to get and complete disappointment engulfed us. We ordered Mongolian Beef, Hunan Chicken, combo fried rice and pork egg fu Yung. What a joke! All the meat was the same color (never seen white beef before!) And it all tasted the same. Completely bland and at one point I had to spit out the foul taste in my mouth... So disappointed and now am hoping I do not get sick off this, who knows what the hell it was, food I just consumed. So grossed out that it was something rodent type that I am gagging as I write this! On a good note the wrapped fortune cookies tasted just fine! Wished I would have ordered 4 dozen of these instead of the crap I ate. So disgusting! The one star was for the cookie."}
{"text":"Great location, clean store and friendly staff. Staff is also accommodating and efficient. We started off with crab angels aka crab puffs. They are not stingy with cream cheese here. I ordered orange chicken with noodles instead of the default white rice. The noodles were tasty but too juicy. Orange chicken filled with white chicken breast meat was delicious. My fiancée ordered veggie lo mein and liked it a lot. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good - like I remembered Chinese food to be... Before I became so used to American Chinese. The lunch special was filling, the service was good & the place was clean, even the bathrooms. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Orange chicken with steamed rice. Fresh! The batter was so light, fluffy and crunchy and the chicken was so soft. It came with chilies so I expected it to be spicy but it had not chili spice taste. It was delicious! Lunch specials only $6.50, great deal great food! ($2.50 for soda, expected). It was very quiet, I think some reviews had made it slow but I don't see why. It was clean, fast service, great food! I hope to see this place in the 4-5star rating as I'm a foodie and love trying new places, I try to stick with 4-5 star ratings. I'll deformed be coming back here a lot!"}
{"text":"Not very good, Egg foo young nothing but ground pre made discs with no taste. Fried rice is a joke, only rice with soy to make it brown. This place not for me!"}
{"text":"This is my fav Chinese in Surprise. The food is always hot and fresh and the employees are super nice."}
{"text":"We tried this place no long after it opened and had a coupon.  I'm always willing to try new Chinese restaurants since I can't seem to find many good ones in the Phoenix area. 

The food was edible.. we will not be going back."}
{"text":"K - Otic.

No wei!  We had to wait almost an hour for takeout food.  It's also wei expensive for a hole in the wall restaurant, dishes ranging between 
$8 to $14.  We got the orange chicken, shrimp egg foo young, mongolian beef, moo shu veggies and egg rolls.  For the price of the dishes I expected more....and that's mainly coming from being spoiled with family in the Chinese restaurant business that has been awarded 4 stars and charge just as much as this place if not less.

No chinese veggies like baby bok choy or chinese broccoli or etc.

The egg rolls were more like tiny spring rolls and came 1 per order.  It almost tasted like there was nutmeg in it and while it wasn't grease filled, I wish it had been filled with something a little more.

The orange chicken was by far the best dish.  Big juicy pieces of chicken, tangy sweet sauce...yum.

The egg foo young was pretty decent.  Tons of sauce, so at least it wasn't dry.

The mongolian beef was almost tasteless and not very spicey.  Tons more onions than pieces of beef.

The moo shu veggies were nothing to scream about and if it weren't for the hoisin sauce, I probably would have pushed it to the side.

On top of it all, when the food was ready to be picked up, no one knew where the order had gone or what had been ordered.  Three different people asked and finally after 10 minutes, the order was found and paid for.

So the only reason why I gave the three stars is because overall the food was decent.  I've had WAY worse Chinese food.  I'm hoping all the chaos was due to a new opening.

However, mark my words:  if I try this place again and it's just as unorganized and frustrating, I will take my stars and go home!

The upside is that lunch seems to be reasonably priced, maybe that's what I should wean myself into.

Oh...and no liquor license yet....but I gather that's the city of Surprise's fault as I heard the same thing from other businesses."}
{"text":"Just not good food.
Didn't taste fresh.
Egg rolls were horrible, couldn't eat them.
Where in Surprise can you get good Chinese???"}
{"text":"Mediocre food & terrible service.  Got 2 stars cuz they offer lunch specials 7 days per week & innovative dinner specials which are modeled after the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Best in town! I've lived in the West valley for about a year and my husband and I have been searching all over for good Chinese food. While there are decent places out there (and some scary ones!) none of them was as good as Golden Wei! I was looking for a very particular style dish and they are the only place that has it (that I've tried so far). I ordered take out and everything was ready quicker than the expected time. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was so delicious! I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  Bad food.  Rude service.  Wife ordered crispy noodles.  It didn't even have noodles, only wontons.  Horrible.   Needless to say,  we will never be back."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, bill was $10 more than what I ordered. When I asked the driver why it was $ 24 when I ordered 2 $6 lunch specials? The driver told me \"because of gas\"! Ummm no! You go now, I buy your food no more! Then the owner called and wanted to yell at me. Great customer service!"}
