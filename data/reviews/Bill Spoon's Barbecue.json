{"text":"This is hands-down the best eastern NC barbecue in Charlotte, if not the whole state.  I'm pretty sure that they were rated a top 10 BBQ restaurant in the country by Zagat.  As a native North Carolinian, I'm picky about my Q.  It has to be \"clean\" (fat removed), with a great smoky flavor.  Their hushpuppies and cole slaw are great too.  I don't like a heavy mayo-based slaw.  Spoons is more vinegar and mustard based.  No bar, however, so we tend to go for lunch rather than dinner."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of spoons BBQ since the sixties I guess certainly the seventies. My wife and I used to bring our little baby boy and we ate there he turned 33 last week. Now I meet him there for lunch."}
{"text":"Finally I had occasion to dine at Bill Spoon's Barbeque.  I had the $10 lunch special, which is a small BBQ plate with coleslaw, hush puppies, a drink,  and one other side; I chose baked beans.  The BBQ is chopped pork eastern-NC-style, and it was perfection.  The sauce was tangy but did not overwhelm the meat, and the meat was tasty.  The baked beans were above average and the hush puppies, well, they may be the best I have ever had.  They were fresh, they were sweet, and they had a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness that was delightful.  The dining room is unaffected; those that know Carolina BBQ joints know exactly what it looks like inside.  The food was on my table faster than fast food, and the waitress remained friendly and attentive.  I have enjoyed excellent BBQ at Bridge's in Shelby and at Lexington BBQ, along with many other contenders and pretenders for Carolina BBQ fame, and this, frankly, was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star for the attentive service.  As for the absurdly expensive and terribly overcooked and tasteless ribs?  Worst I've ever had.  I've eaten BBQ from Seattle to Miami, including those famous places and ribs in St. Louis.  My issue with Bill's is not the type of sauce-as they use a dry rub.  It was the ribs: over cooked, the rub, which may have had some taste hours earlier, had none by the time I was served.  Just awful.  Now I know why people here in town think Midwood Smoke House is so good-compared to Bill's my dog's old bones would taste better.  The BBQ potatoes?  Also tasteless.  This place has been around for 40 plus years-but clearly, the place sustains itself on some old reputation.  The server, who was very nice, and who I tipped out at 20% saw that i left nearly an entire rib uneaten-but never asked if I enjoyed them-it was clear to a casual observer, i did not. Find another place for your ribs!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for \"Carolina BBQ,\" you have to check this place out. Bill Spoon's is an institution  for BBQ and by far the best in Charlotte. I have tried them all, and you can really taste the difference. The swine is mighty fine with a smokey, tender and juicy taste that is capped off with traditional Carolina sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Check out any of the sides, they are all good. The Brunswick stew is elite.   On side from the excellent food, you can find what the South does best: hospitality and sweet tea. I love the warm atmosphere and home feeling. Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is, went today because I got trumped by the coworkers I went to lunch with. Don't wanna bash the place too much as the service was good and that I'm not a 'Carolina' style bbq person. Just can't get with all the vinegar and plus the meat was pretty dry."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with vinegar-based BBBQ (yep, the extra B is for BYOBB). I have to say that the taste is not quite something that I would crave. However, the food was still good (BBQ, cole slaw, BBQ potatoes, and hush puppies). The hush puppies here are absolutely phenomenal. If I lived around the area, I would go back just for the hush puppies!  Even though the style of BBQ didn't totally fit my tastes, the hush puppies were delicious and the service is a great example of southern hospitality. The staff was so nice!  Remember, cash and checks only!"}
{"text":"Only one of us went here (expiring groupon...use it or lose it...could only make it for lunch by myself...I'm sure everyone can relate) so it is strictly one persons opinion this time.  My basic review is that the decor was not that great, food was average, and service was not great.  Yet I kinda loved it.  In a weird way I like these places that just seem too stubborn to change with time.  I grew up in a small town and I guess these are places that remind me of that.  They are definitely a dying breed...maybe that's why I'm going so easy on them.  The place is easy to find right off a major road and parking is easy.  One important thing to keep in mind is that they are only open for lunch Monday-Wednesday.  Don't show up for dinner on those days...been there done that.  Cost is a little high in my opinion for the quality and quantity you get.  I feel like you can get better BBQ for the money  **cough** Mac's Speed Shop **cough**.   I got the large BBQ combo plate with 7oz of BBQ and 1/4 chicken and 2 sides (mac and cheese, brunswick stew) for like $14.  Hush puppies and the mac and cheese were really good, brunswick stew was good, BBQ and the BBQ chicken were average.  And I thought the portions where a little underwhelming...for almost $15 I only left with 2 small containers of BBQ and mac and cheese as leftovers.  I realize my review is borderline awful experience but I could see myself going back possibly.  What can I say, the place has a certain charm to it.  Plus I have eaten there years ago and remember it being pretty good so I try not to poo poo a place based just on one experience.  I give it 3 spoons out of 5"}
{"text":"OMG. This is the best BBQ ever. Ole Bill's recipe has no match.  The mac 'n cheese is heaven on earth."}
{"text":"Spoons is the best- hands down. I wonder if the folks that don't like it just don't get it. BBQ is simple, tender and finely chopped. Vinegar sauce spices it up. Hush puppies are all you can eat!! Yum- love me some puppies!!  Tea is cold and sweet. I've yet to have room for dessert -   The history and ambiance round it out nicely to a 5 star BBQ treat!"}
{"text":"I came from Pittsburgh to Charlotte and asked around about a restaurant that serves Carolina barbecue. It was delicious. The hush puppies were the best that I ever had. The sauce was delicious on my pulled pork sandwich. The only reason why this did not receive 5 stars was because the cole slaw was just so-so. The banana pudding was delicious. The service was excellent and every waitress made you feel like you belonged even though I came in solo. My dad used to tell me that the sign of a good restaurant is that it is crowded. This place was mobbed at lunch. Very good meal! Will definitely go again when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Bill needs to get a new spoon.    Traveling from South Carolina up to New Jersey we found this place due to the good reviews on Yelp. It was a bit disappointing and not what we expected based on the reviews we read. My brother got a half rack of ribs macaroni and cheese and coleslaw The ribs and the macaroni and cheese were the same temperature ... very hot ... obviously microwaved. Way hotter than what would come out of the smoker. The ribs were lacking in flavor, no smoke ring  and overcooked. The bark was soggy. I had the rib, chicken combo and a side of baked beans. The chicken was not bad fell off the bone and had some flavor. I believe my plate was microwaved as everything was the same temperature.  The waitress was very nice and very attentive. She kept our iced teas full and asked us multiple times if we needed anything. Very friendly. At the end of the day we spent $50 for two meals and two drinks which seems a bit pricey for sub-par BBQ."}
{"text":"There seems to be an explosion in barbecue restaurants in south Charlotte lately.  Some of them are crazy expensive like $15 for some cue and two sides (add tea, tax and tip and you're well over $20).  Barbecue began as an inexpensive but magically tasty source of food so I find it curious that these new places think they can charge premium prices.    Bill Spoon's remains true to it's roots and is a god-send among some of these trendy (ridiculous) new places.  Go to Spoons and experience all the things that makes barbecue great.  Simple, well-prepared barbecue.  Simple but well-prepared sides.  Simple decor.  Friendly southern service.  The building is plain and simple.  The decor is plain and simple.  Food comes on a paper plate.    But the food is great.  The service is fast.  The prices are good.  And there's a family tradition here that no \"investor group\" can create at one of the fancy new places.  Kudos to Steve for carrying on the work his grandfather began.  And for keeping it real.    If you want to go and spend $22 on mediocre barbecue at a trendy full service restaurant, go ahead.  I'll dine at Spoons.  I'll have a better meal and a better time.  And I'll keep more money in my pocket."}
{"text":"Charlotte gets the short end of the stick when it comes to BBQ.  There are a few places left, but nothing outstanding.  Except for Bill Spoon's.  It's the only BBQ worth eating in the city.  Other restaurants like BBQ King or Bubba's can fill in when Bill's isn't open, but nothing satisfies or comes close like Bill Spoon's.    This is a gem that is overlooked in the discussion of great BBQ.  I don't know why it isn't part of the NC BBQ Society's BBQ trail but it deserves to be.  Bill's is a Charlotte institution.  They're only open for lunch and I guess that model has served them well.  The restaurant is currently run by Bill's grandson and according to everything I've heard, he hasn't changed anything.  You still get the same friendly service with a smile, a good conversation, and are treated like family, not a customer.  Bill was famous for his love of people and his belief that everyone deserved a good meal.  That philosophy continues today and is part of the reason I keep going back.  It's like going home.  The pulled pork is excellent.  There is always plenty of food, the ice tea is the best I've ever had, and the sauce is, in my opinion, a model for how eastern style sauce should taste.  Don't miss the banana pudding for desert.  I heard that they use an electric smoker for their meat.  I don't know if this is true, but the meat is good enough to stand up on its own.  There isn't the smell of Hickory when you're there, so an electric smoker might not be all that far fetched.  Unlike most places, Bill's cooks whole hogs, not just shoulders and butts.  You can taste the difference in the meat when it comes from the whole hog.  This is a place that is worth making a special point to go to."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq in Charlotte! I would HIGHLY recommend this place if you haven't been there! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  I love Eastern Carolina BBQ and this place nailed it. Don't come here for anything besides the BBQ (pulled pork). It's what they do best. Tender, juicy and oh so good!  Sauce is on point too. If you don't like vinegar you don't like this kind of BBQ.   Some of the best BBQ in the state is King's BBQ in Kinston, NC. This place is giving them a run for their money and hands down is the best in Charlotte. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"The customer service here is five stars - everyone is super nice, accomodating, sweet, etc. However, the food is disappointing.   I've enjoyed trying different kinds of barbecue since moving to Charlotte from the midwest three years ago. I heard that Bill Spoon's was THE place to go, so after a trial run (whoops - they aren't open for dinner!) I finally made it there for lunch today.   Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The hush puppies were good and the mustard/vinegar coleslaw was tasty. But the barbecue itself lacked flavor, and - most offputting - was chopped beyond recognition. Texture here was the problem - the brunswick stew, pork barbecue and coleslaw all had the same thick, baby-food consistency. I like my pulled pork tender, but this was taken way too far."}
{"text":"Old School Barbecue in the eastern NC style (which I prefer).  Smoky pig and sweet tea are two of my favorite things about NC.  Family run by really nice folks, a friendly adventure in the wayback machine."}
{"text":"Absolute best BBQ you will find in Charlotte. It's just as good as anything you will find in Lexington. Staff was great. Bought a groupon to try it out and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent Carolina BBQ. If you like a vinegar based sauce you'll love Bill Spoons. They don't have ribs on the menu but after talking with the family I was informed that they put the rib meat in the shredded pork.  You can tell, the shredded pork was great. As far as sides go they're equally as good. The homemade hush puppies are outstanding and the Brunswick stew is amazing! It's hard to find Brunswick stew in the Carolina's and even harder to find good Brunswick stew. The service is great and Bill Spoons is family owned. Perfect example of a local family owned restaurant that takes tremendous pride in their product."}
{"text":"Poor. I don't understand what all the hubbub is about over this place. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. It tasted like they bought frozen meat and used that instead of smoking it themselves. I was very disappointed with the food. If you want real bbq, go to Texas."}
{"text":"Awful. Salt on salt on salt. Mustard-based cole slaw?? About 8 people in the place at 1:15. To add insult to injury, $9 for a SMALL BBQ plate which includes the nasty coleslaw and hush puppies (which were salty but crispy). I added a side of fries for a dollar extra and got about 18 bagged, soggy fries. Never going back"}
{"text":"First, they do take credit and debit cards now!  Second, the best Eastern Style BBQ in Charlotte period!  Meat is cooked and chopped perfectly and all the sides are great."}
{"text":"Wow, I cant say enough good things about Steve and his crew at this restraunt. I needed a food preparation for a Sunday (which they are closed). They went above and beyond the expectation to fill an order for 80+ people. Everyone loved the food. Steve made sure we had everything that we needed. As a representative for a corporation I always try to put my best foot forward and Bill Spoons Barbecue certainly allowed me to do that. You have earned a customer and I am thankful for all of the help!  Justin"}
{"text":"When I ate meat, Eastern NC-style barbecue was one of my favorites... even now, it's a terrible, terrible temptation.  And Spoon's is the best - the BEST.  We grew up going to Spoon's, mostly because we knew the family from church.  Back when I was a kid, I hated barbecue, so I often ordered the chicken or the fish n chips (both of which I remember being pretty tasty).  I have some very early memories of eating at Spoon's - the yellow and white checked tablecloths, the weird mural on the back wall, the hard strawberry candies, the letter from Dan Quayle, the banana pudding...  For a period of years after I left Charlotte for college and adulthood, I didn't go to Spoon's.  I sort of forgot it existed.  And then, one day a few years ago, I visited again.  And it was EXACTLY THE SAME.  Seriously.  Nothing had changed.  We went for lunch, and when we paid, Bill Spoon looked at our check, commented that we wouldn't be coming back if they always charged us so much to eat, and promptly rounded down the tab.  Amazing.  I love that Bill Spoon's is still around.  I love that they've never changed.  I love that it's still in the family.  (Also, everything on the menu is awesome - the barbecue, obviously - but the banana pudding is really the best, most authentic NC banana pudding.  Marie Spoon used to save a bit for me every time we came, just in case they ran out.)"}
{"text":"The entryway for Bill's Spoon has several \"best of\" stickers professing great things to come. Unfortunately these musings of the past sets the bar just too high. The pork plate was well cooked, but lacked any real flavor. The addition of the homemade vinegar sauce brought BBQ up a notch, well, maybe a half notch.   For all the rave reviews, this place falls flat. Good service, but an empty restaurant at dinner time on a Friday, and a pork plate that has been resting on its laurels for the past 15 years makes Bill Spoon's a has been. Look elsewhere for your BBQ."}
{"text":"This was my first foray into \"real\" North Carolina Style BBQ.  Simple menu and simple food that is delicious.  We arrived at 2:45 PM (note that they close at 3:00 PM) and we were greated with smiles and warmth - the waitress couldn't have been nicer.  Loved the vinegar-based sauce and the brunswick stew was incredible.  We left with full bellies and two pulled pork sandwiches and a bottle of their homemade sauce for the road.    We were stranded in Charlotte en-route to Boston and Bill Spoons warmed our cold, yankee hearts to the core.  Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. This is a traditional BBQ joint. Nothing too fancy about the food but it the simplicity that makes this place good. The pulled pork is done right. And with the spicy vinegar based sauce you can't go wrong. All side are homemade and the portion sizes are good for the price. If your in the mood for good Carolina BBQ Bill's has the right idea!"}
{"text":"Classic eastern NC BBQ done right! The best in town no doubt. Great southern hospitality with hush puppies, slaw, sweet tea and banana pudding.  Doesn't get any better.  If you are looking for a hip and trendy decor go to some hip and trendy place. If you are looking for down home southern goodness the way it has been done for 50 years and the best in town come to Bill Spoon's.  Great man, great legacy, great food."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The BBQ was surprisingly chipped, used to pulled pork (ie chunks) but the flavour was good, especially with the vinegar & regular sauce.  The vinegar based (non sweet) cold slaw was the best I've ever had...anywhere...it's that good. Some mystery spice/herb/? in it. Celery root? whatever it was rocked. Same with the onion rings. Super light super crunchy coating. Tea was good & I agree, the hushpuppies were terrific.  This isn't a fancy joint by any means, but very solid. Wish I'd had room for the banana pudding, but was stuffed. Maybe next time. Plates do not include toast, or pickles, which I thought was unusual. Maybe I'm the only weirdo that loves making little mini sandwiches with my BBQ.  They DO take credit cards, I noticed older reviews saying they didn't."}
{"text":"No real bells and whistles, has been around for-eva...just solid 'cue that comes out lightening fast, and tasted pretty darn good.    As Chad E. mentioned, the pulled pork isn't pulled, more like pulverized, and soaks up a LOT of that vinegary sauce. The mac and cheese is a bit greasy and heavy for my liking, but a nice accompaniment to the sweet and smoky baked beans.   Our server had our food out within, I'm not kidding 90 seconds of us ordering, and even took the time to replace our hush puppies with hot ones just out of the fryer when they were available.   PS: Don't ask for anything special like brisket or bunt ends, it doesn't exist here.  Just enjoy what you get, and get on with your day!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this style bbq, I thought it was tough to chew too. I like pulled style Lexington. And they actually put mustard in the slaw, yuck! My husband and I are complete opposites, so as you can imagine he liked it. Also, I am a Carolina girl, born and raised in Charlotte. Two small plates and two teas $22 for lunch, this is very expensive for lunch!"}
{"text":"I know K.C. BBQ.  Ribs and brisket.  Never had pulled pork before.  I ordered pulled pork and slaw and potato salad.  Also received hush puppies.  The pork was delicious.  Great flavor.  Really enjoyed it.  Never had mustard based cole slaw.  Prob. an acquired taste.  Hush puppies were very tasty.  The staff was very friendly.  I kept hearing how this is the best in town.  I certainly enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"I had the fried pickles they were great!!! Was in town to watch my Panthers play!! Great place for a bite to eat"}
{"text":"When we planned our trip to Charlotte I began asking around for recommendations for barbecue.  This place was the one that was highlighted.  Our party put all the pressure on me for the selection; I wanted this to come through.  Foodwise, Spoon's delivers all right.  They kept highlighting their new ribs.  It was unclear to me whether they never had ribs before or whether this was a new recipe.  Two of us ordered ribs, the other two barbecue, which means chopped whole hog.  Since I was having a platter, I received a soda and apparently a refill.  That is where things got wonky.  Service was rough.  The refill never came nor did the hush puppies.  That was frustrating.  I had a bite of the ribs.  They were okay.  Frankly, they were cooked too much as they came right off the bone.  I didn't taste much seasoning, although they smelled heavenly.  The barbecue left me wanting.  There was no taste other than pork.  Don't get me wrong, it was cooked fine, but again, seasoning was not present.  I used the vinegar sauce.  I enjoyed that and it perked up the barbecue nicely.  My side was Brunswick stew.  Nothing wrong there, but nothing extraordinary either.  Whenever I hit a barbecue joint, I always ask to see the pit.  The guy was very accommodating with that.  He apologized that the one pit hadn't been cleaned.  No worries, trust me.  He explained that county regs now forbade cooking commercially on open pits.  The two electric pits are in a small smokehouse.  He had a half dozen pans of mac and cheese smoking in the one pit.  A normal day is smoking two whole hogs up to 140 pounds each and a few Smithfield hams.  That made an impression as one of our party works for Smithfield.  This was an enjoyable experience.  I would come back.  It, like a lot of places, play it conservative in the preparation of the 'cue so not to be too spicy, smokey, etc.  I would have liked it to be more bold."}
{"text":"Visiting from CT and we stopped here because of the raving reviews. Man, the service was phenomenal. Delicious sweet tea and amazing hush puppies that are constantly refilled so they're fresh. Their house made BBQ sauce is really great too. They have ribs now too but honestly just the pork BBQ that's pulled is much better. Very filling and great meal."}
{"text":"I received an education today!!  Where I come from, we always hear how we have go to certain regions to really enjoy BBQ.  I now know what they mean!  For my first taste of North Carolina BBQ, I lucked out!  The hushpuppies are fabulous!  So much flavor!  The mac n cheese is perfect as a side dish, a complement to the maincourses and not overpowering.  Great cheese flavor and wonderful overall texture.  My first exposure to the vinegar based sauce was great!  Loved it!   Tasty balanced rub on the ribs.  I want sample all the meats on the menu!  But, alas, my belly has only so much capacity!  And not draining on the wallet!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. I grew up in Charlotte and every time my husband and I are back in town we come here. I always get the BBQ plate with slaw and of course hush puppies. The BBQ is a very particular style, Eastern NC, and we haven't found it like this anywhere else in the country. And believe me, we are ALWAYS looking. If you want a drippy red sweet sauce, you won't like it. It's vinegar based, which we love. The service is fast and friendly. The hush puppies can't be beat. The Mac & Cheese isn't great, so I wouldn't get that (not really any flavor, mushy). But I love everything else. I will be back over and over and over."}
{"text":"I don't often crave eastern Carolina barbecue but when I woke up this morning I had just two words running through my head: \"Bill Spoon's\".  Got there around 11:30 and was greeted by the friendliest people. Ordered the small plate with mac and cheese and potato salad. Don't you judge me.  My glass of sweet tea was never empty. My craving for hush puppies was met with an offer of some more. Yes, please!  Good food, served fast, from helpful and friendly people. Yellow checkered table cloths, wood paneled walls, ancient light fixtures that look like they belong in my momma's home. This is what the South is all about. At least, it should be."}
{"text":"I'm a long time area resident who does bbq for charity quite often. I love Spoon's, I was fortunate enough to meet the original owner, went to school with his son, and now Impressed how good the grandson is with customers. The staff is wonderful, bbq is great, hush puppies are magnificent (I know the secret, but you don't want to know), I was hesitant on the mustard based coleslaw, but after trying it was tasty. I have made my own ENC bbq sauce, and Spoons is very good. I usually mix a more catchup based sauce with the vinegar based, maybe I should cut down on the catchup on my sauce.......I'm glad I'm close to the best BBQ restaurant in Charlotte. We have many pretenders, but Spoon's put them to shame. Why doesn't one of the Lexington folks open a place here? We have Sonny's(gag),Hillbilly(gag), Macs(overrated), Nicks(chain BBQ sucks), The greek places that serve canned BBQ(see BBQ King). The closest place to Charlotte besides Spoons I'd recommend is 521 BBQ in Indianland."}
{"text":"In my quest to explore everything southern South Blvd has to offer, I stopped in Bill Spoon's last Friday for lunch.  I should start off by saying that I was born and raised in Eastern NC (Go Pirates!). I get the food....the overly chopped BBQ, the vinegar, the mustard coleslaw. I get it and it feels like home. However, if you are not used to Eastern NC style, this could be weird. Give it a try. It is 100% nothing like the pulled pork, ketchup/bbq based thick sauce style. If you don't like Bill Spoon's, then you probably don't like Eastern NC style in general!  I ordered the Bill Spoon's special, which is pork, 2 sides, hushpuppies, and a drink for $11. I got mac n cheese and collards. The pork was nicely chopped and the vinegar sauce was exactly what I expected....I actually requested more and added it to my BBQ. The mac n' cheese was super flavorful and cheesy. The collards were definitely reminiscent of my childhood. Tender and vinegary. The hushpuppies were perfection.   Overall, this is the epitome of Eastern NC. Rustic (some may say old) vibe instead with food from my childhood!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly. Food is average at best. Pork sandwich was pretty tasteless. Tomato based sauce was good.  Food was much better at Midwood."}
{"text":"Was told by several locals that this is the best BBQ in town.  I have to agree and say it's also some of the best I've ever had.  For years I've heard about BBQ out there that doesn't need sauce.  I scoffed at these tales of legendary que, but at Spoon's you don't need sauce.  It's that damn good. Now, you can add a little, depending on your taste, and it enhances the flavor.  But sauce is not a requirement.    Hush puppies come with everything and they are little warm puffs of delight.  The slaw and beans are my two favorite sides. Enjoy your meal with a glass of the best sweet tea in Charlotte (sorry Pressley's but it's time to let go) and finish it off with nanner puddin that would make my grandma quit cooking.  Top 3 BBQ experience of my life."}
{"text":"Neat & clean. The Bbq had a sour background taste. Slaw waaay too pungent. Brunswick stew was only a spoonful & had a slight burned taste. Hushpuppies had a dark flavor. Worst meal I had in months."}
{"text":"Dined-in with my wife and 3 children this past weekend. This was our 2nd time dining here. There wasn't much of a wait and we were sat promptly. There were only 2 waitresses, one of which was either very new and hasn't worked in the hospitality industry very long or just really needs to up her service. The other waitress was great and had waited on us before, but unfortunately for her she was having to do most of the work since the other one wasn't  pulling her weight. My wife and children received received their BBQ sandwiches and hot dog pretty quickly, but I had ordered the 1/3 rack of ribs and 2 sides and never received my meal. 10-15 mins after my family was done eating the waitress comes over and says the delay is due to the ribs needing to cook and takes longer. I was so fed up at that point (and hungry!) that I just asked that my meal be placed to-go at that point. So the waitress goes back to the kitchen window, has a few words with the cook and then comes back and asks me if I'd like my ribs hot or cold?! At that point, I was over Bill Spoon's and there lack of service and I promptly canceled my order, paid for my wife's and children's meals and left empty handed and still hungry. Needless to say we will not be returning to dine here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've visited the Charlotte area and had lunch and dinner at Bill Spoon's BBQ.  This is my first time having North Carolina BBQ.  It is different from the Texas and Chicago style of BBQ I have experienced.  Note:  My reviews are about the food, so I don't generally comment on decor or service.  I thought the chopped pork small plate was excellent.  I tried it without sauce to get the flavor of the meat and it is excellent.  Sauce is sweet with a good depth of flavor.  Hushpuppies were very good and a treat as I did not know they were coming.  Sides were coleslaw and potato salad.  Both are mustard based which is different than what I've eaten in the past.  Very good acidity and just a hint of sweetness.  It cuts the richness of the pork nicely.  I will be back for the collards, green beans and mac/cheese.    Had the fried flounder today.  Expertly fried fish.  Very tasty and will definitely be back for it again.  At $12 for lunch and an iced tea, you can't go wrong.  Staff was very nice and spent time visiting with me.  Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding!  However $12.50 for a \"large\" pork plate and 2 sides is unacceptable. The meat was moist and tasty but potatoes and Mac/cheese tasted like a middle school cafeteria. Sorry doubt ill be back. Meal only worth $6.99 at the most. Too much $ for lunch even if this place is on TV from time to time"}
{"text":"For a place that basically only offers pork and chicken, you would think those two BBQ staples would be very good.  Unfortunately, the pork was extremely mushy and without much flavor - didn't look \"shredded\", it actually looked like someone had put it in a blender.  The chicken was very dry.  The atmosphere is non-existent, the AC was on high and the place was far too cold, and there is only one option for BBQ sauce.  We all agreed that it tasted like middle-school cafeteria food, or \"BBQ\" if it came from a trashy bowling-alley.  There are many, many better options in Charlotte, and I honestly do not understand how this place has an average of 4 stars."}
{"text":"True southern style bbq! I got a groupon to this place so I paid $10 bucks for $20 dollar worth of food for two people. The pulled pork was cooked perfectly - tender, juicy and lots of aroma flavors. It didn't even need side of bbq sauce. I got two sides - bbq baked beans and potato salad. Everything was good and tasted fresh. Definitely recommend everyone who loves bbq as much as I do should go here. Note they open only on certain times of the week. (:"}
{"text":"There's a lot to like at this little restaurant and this is the second time that I have stayed in Charlotte while on the road.  This restaurant had great reviews and we thought that we would try it.  Pulling up, the parking lot was big but mostly empty but then again, it was getting late in the evening. As a BBQ lover, one can really appreciate the little touches they use such as the company motto, we cook true whole pig!  We walked in and we're greeted right away, which is always a plus. You walk into a messy cashier area and into a wall that has a plate of dirty dishes as it goes into the kitchen. On the left is dining room.  After a few minutes, a lovely lady greeted us and led us to our table. She explained the menu, was very hospitable. She left us for a short bit and after as we were reviewing the menu, she came back with hot hush puppies for us to munch on and cold glasses of ice water as it was a hot day outside. It's this level of service that makes you remember places like this.  We ordered an assortment of menu items to try. My stepson ordered the small BBQ plate, my wife and I ordered the half chicken. This came with an assortment of choices like coleslaw, mac and cheese, hush puppies, etc.   The two bathrooms are small but clean in the back of the dining room but they service only one at a time.   It didn't take long for the food to arrive and the BBQ sauce is very vinegary but upon reading the definition of North Carolina BBQ, that should be what to expect. This flavour profile is not one I cherish, if it were more subtle, perhaps it would be more to my taste.   The restaurant was very open to my opinions but I told them that They would have to read about it online.  Overall, the bill was in line with what we have been paying for meals of 5 on our trip  So, service is a 5/5 Food 3/5 probably because of my taste preferences   Overall, me and my family will probably not return but definitely worth a try if you're looking for North Carolina BBQ in the area."}
{"text":"Well. To start we are all born and raised in NYC. So, this is our first time trying a true southern restaurant. I will admit it's not bad. But I'll honestly never go back. If you are into vinegar style bbq then this is your place."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte 8-9 Years ago for business. The only business trip I've ever been invited on. First part of August, and humidity was stunning.  Never wished so badly to be outside in the sun, immersed in water up to my neck all Day, like I felt during that Week. The second the sun went down the World changed. Never experienced it before or since. Thought at the time that I would love to come back to NC-SC in October.   Went to 4-5 BBQ joints.  Bill Spoons twice. At the time, had never ever heard of putting slaw on any sandwich. Or Hot Dog.  And the NC slaw was different than the coarsely chopped sweet stuff with pineapple chunks I grew up on in Seattle.  I ordered a pulled pork (or just Pork?) sandwich.  They described the difference between Eastern and Western NC BBQ, their \"Whole Hog\" approach with vinegar based sauce, and almost seemed be apologetic. I checked out the Sandwich, tested the meat, then took the slaw from the cup and put it on the Meat. Nobody had suggested to do this, and I had not brought it up. Every employees face that I could see changed to an ear-to-ear smile.  Wonderful sandwich, and a memorable personal moment for me. Thank you all. I may be six feet under before I make it anywhere past Washington-Oregon-Idaho-California again. Will try Bill Spoons once more if that works out differently!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite barbecue places in Charlotte,  Highly recommend the pork and the Brunswick stew.  The banana pudding is also awesome.  I will say the one thing to avoid here is the chicken.  BTW BBQ is a noun and not a verb."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times so far. Each time the service has been great and the food great as well. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times but their coleslaw is a bit strange as I'm not accustomed to a mustard based slaw. My husband ordered the Brunswick stew both times and its very good. Their sweet tea is pretty awesome too. The banana pudding is pretty darn good too. Oh and they seat you immediately even when the place is packed. Basically you can't go wrong with Bill Spoons...."}
{"text":"When the opportunity for me to try this place came up I was really excited to go and check it out. I love BBQ and thought this hometown place would be great. After my experience I understand why they are on Groupon selling there dinners for half price.   I got pork plate with mac and cheese , Brunswick stew and hush puppies.  The pork although I understand chopped pork instead of pulled. It really lacked any type of true texture and meatiness with it being chopped to death. It was really really dry. Left no room for nice juicy meat because it was all chopped out. Which because of that it makes me question is it as fresh as it should be, or is this a mixture of today's, yesterday's, and the day before pork. It would be so easy to mix it all together and serve it as fresh and it not be. No one would really notice. The pork has a vinegar taste which I understand is a way you can do BBQ which I normally don't have a problem with but it was very strong you tasted the vinegar before you tasted the pork. Which makes me question freshness again when it comes to hiding when the meat was actually cooked.   The mac and cheese was just sad. The noodles were truly overcooked and dissolved to mush in your mouth as soon as you take a bite. You can also tell that since it's overcooked the cheese/ cheese sauce they use has curdled. Making it a mushy clumpy mess.  The Brunswick stew is strange to say the least. It was very very very sweet. I understand you can put BBQ sauce in Brunswick stew but my stew should not be tasting like bake beans or sweet stew. Which now makes me question what they do with all those left over bake beans are they in the Brunswick stew, I don't know but it sure taste like it. With it being so sweet obviously you have rich items in the stew and they need salt and seasoning and none of that is there.   Finally the hush puppies they were burnt all 12 the whole dozen were burnt. Which made them obviously dry.  This is an old school place and you can tell by the decor and how they run the business. But I have not issue with that at all. It was clearly the food.  I did not get to meet most of the staff but the young lady who took my order was not welcoming and very dry. Did not know the menu enough to explain any of it. She is the first face you see coming in and she need to be the highlight of the place to make you want to stay and enjoy.    I really hope this place has the opportunity to change and enhance itself because they need it."}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for the weekend. Everyone said i should try the BBQ. Went online to find a recommended place.  Needless to say I selected Bills Spoon Barbecue. Sweetest staff, with good 'ol Southern Hospitality. Food just didn't hit the mark. I understand its bbq but somehow i expected to be overwhelmed. Not so. If I have the time while in town Ill find a place that will redeem the North Carolina reputation."}
{"text":"Loved the chopped pork bbq and vinegar sauce...it's the kind of mushy pork I remember from the road trips of my youth. The sides we good, and on the smallish size, but not anything that wowed me."}
{"text":"Ordered the rib, green beans and potatoes to-go through Doorstep and omg... The ribs were fall off the bone and the sauce was so delicious! I HATE green beans because of how bland they taste, but these green beans seemed somewhat sweet and they were just amazing! I definitely wish I had time to come and dine-in."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday to see for ourselves how good the BBQ is. Boy were we glad we did! The chopped pork and BBQ chicken were great! We also sampled the Mac & cheese, BBQ potatoes and Brunswick stew and they are all good. The staff was also very friendly and made you feel very welcome. If you enjoy eastern NC BBQ please try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This spot is definitely a Charlotte institution.  The style of BBQ here is Carolina so a lot of vinegar based sauces and their preference is pork and chicken for the meats.  They decor looks original to the 1963 vintage and appears to have changed little since. Food wise, there are some great affordable eats here.  I personally do not like Carolina style BBQ too much, but they did have a great sweet BBQ sauce.  I had the half chicken plate and the breast was a little dry, but nothing that sauce didn't fix. Service was friendly and efficient, but not too overly friendly like at some establishments."}
{"text":"When my husband and I first moved to Charlotte we were told this was the place to go for real, southern BBQ. What I didn't realize is that southern BBQ is not slathered with BBQ sauce and grilled. Like it is in California. :) However, when we walked in we immediately realized we liked the place. It seemed like the perfect mix of a greasy diner and my grandmother's kitchen. Bill - the owner - still works there and waits on his customers. He offered us a sample of just about everything before we ordered. I'd absolutely recommend this place.   Careful, though, they're not open past 3 pm! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that just got it so right the first time, they refused to change... and after how many years now, they still haven't.  You walk in, and are seated by women wearing some really old style outfits, in a dining area that I'm sure is the exact same style now as the day they opened.  This isn't really a complaint, I'm just painting the picture.    I ordered the Best of Both Combo Plate that comes with white chicken (which cost an extra $1) and Pulled Shredded Pork.  And when they say shredded, they mean completely and absolutely pulverized, which I guess is the NC way of doing it, but I was a bit taken back by it at first.  The pulled/shredded pork was fantastic, especially with their vinegar-based BBQ Sauce that gives the food a nice tangy-spicy flavor. A+  The chicken on the other hand was very dry, and not the best at all.  Also of note, the meal began with some Hush Puppies, and I have to say, best Hush Puppies ever!  Oh, same with the Sweet Tea brought in with the hush puppies, excellent!  I did enjoy the meal overall, however I think they'd do well to think about getting a bit more current with things.  There are other things they can be adding to the menu, and maybe think about changing the way you do that chicken...  Just saying, nothing wrong with being retro, as long as you can keep the customers happy, and I think there's a bit more that can be done in terms of satisfying the customer."}
{"text":"Really good vinegar based whole hog bbq"}
{"text":"Good barbeque, even better banana pudding. Customer service is the best you'll find. Definitely why they have been in business so long."}
{"text":"Ok first things first THEY TAKE CARDS NOW so  go get your Q on.  This is some quality Q. The pork isn't so much pulled as shredded, it makes for an interesting texture but it's really good. If you get a sandwich it's going to come with coleslaw on it (I got it on the side) the 'slaw is has a mustard base which seems strange to me but tastes really good and compliments the pork really well when you put it on top. Mom got the chicken it was juicy and tender not at all dry with just enough sauce to compliment the meat. We wanted a little bit of everything so we  some extra sides here's the rundown.  Beans very good just a hit of sweet. Potato salad ok not great for either of us it was a very wet potato salad made with red potatoes with sort of a mustard, mayo, vinegar sauce not our thing but it may be yours, Onion rings once again not our  thing we both like our onion rings a little more oniony than theirs are but if you like onion rings and not onions these may be for you. Brunswick stew was really good with a hit of a smoky flavor it's not at all chunky like I would expect but still good. Fried pickles very good they're pickle chips not pickle wedges (as fried pickles should be) and are served with ranch. Mac and cheese was a little plain but perfectly serviceable. Hushpuppies are really good and they brought more when we ran out. The service was amazing and friendly when I'm thirsty I can hard to keep up with in terms of water and they never  missed a beat. They serve coke products in cans so there are no free refills. I was already pretty well caffeinated so I just went with water rather than tea. They sell bottles of their vinegar based sauce it was good I'm taking one of those home with me. They cater and SHIP. When I get back home to St Pete I'll order some and let you guys know how that works."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for 16 years.  I've tried every BBQ place from the coast to the mountains.  I can honestly say this is the WORST BBQ I've ever had.  Nothing was good.  I got the lg BBQ plate with slaw and French fries.  The slaw was some nasty mustard and vinegar based concoction that tasted like it had been stored in a dirty old boot. The fries were of the shoestring variety.  They were fries.   The BBQ.  Oh boy.  The BBQ.  This was an extreme disappointment.  I've never had something so bland and tasteless in my life.  Even the Texas Pete and the in house sauce (that was also nothing to shout about) couldn't save the overchopped, almost puréed meat that they called BBQ. Based on the crowd, I'm guessing that this is a charlotte staple that the older crowd is loyal to.  Unfortunately for Spoons, their clientele is dying (literally) out."}
{"text":"I spent a couple of days in the Carolina's with a single goal: to find Carolina-style BBQ and find out what all the fuss is about.  I enrolled in Carolina BBQ 101 at Bill Spoon's and I think I got a good education.    The menu is simple and straightforward, which is greatly appreciated, I recommend getting the pulled pork, it's what they're known for.  I've never had hush puppies outside a seafood place, but I found they complement the meal pretty well.  The food is tasty & reasonably priced, the environment is casual & comfortable, and the staff is very friendly. *like button*"}
{"text":"If you want REAL barbecue that absolutely melts in your mouth, Bill Spoons is the best choice you've ever made as far as eating good! The portions are hefty and bring on the homemade sauce. The staff there are the friendliest folks and will make you feel right at home. The slow cooked Mac & cheese is even good cold, straight from the fridge if you have enough left over to take home. Spoons barbecue has become our new Mother's Day lunch and we hope to keep up the tradition."}
{"text":"The best!  My boyfriend is from Charlotte and he took me to spoons back in 2008.  It has become my favorite place for eastern NC style bbq.   Every time we go back to visit, Spoons is a required stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on a recent trip to NC. We had a great lunch. The pork was tender and succulent. Classic NC style, which we normally don't like, but when in NC, this is what you get. The hush puppies were the best we have ever had rivaling the puppies at BBQ Center in Lexington, NC. The brunswick stew was also unique and tasty. Don't leave without getting some of their banana pudding for dessert. The wait staff is very friendly and courteous. Your iced tea glass will never be less than half full. We look forward to coming back if we are in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty North Carolina style barbecue. Good sweet tea as well. Only thing missing was honey which is tastes great with hush puppies. But when I paid my tab met Steve Spoon introduced himself. Very friendly guy. He is the grandson of Bill who started the business. He said next time just ask him and he will give me some. He showed me they have honey behind the counter. I'd recommend this place any day to barbecue lovers."}
{"text":"We pulled off of 77 after reading the reviews everything sounded promising about this place.  I have to say it just wasn't good, I got a half rack of ribs with Mac and cheese and slaw.  The plate shows up the ribs were so hot I couldn't  touch them so went to the Mac which was just as hot actually the same temp  as the ribs first thing I thought was MICROWAVE!   There was no bark or smoke ring to be found the bark was \"microwave\"soggy they were  over cooked and flavorless. I have nothing  good to say about the sides. I really should of said something about the food to the servers  who were super nice and on the ball but we were in a rush and just wanted to get back on the road."}
{"text":"Brother-in-law's bro declared this place: \"The best barbecue in Charlotte.\" I had to see this.  The menu is pretty straightforward - go for the lunch special: $9 for a plate of barbecue chopped pork, coleslaw, and your choice of fries or Bill Spoon's infamous stew. I went with the latter.  Boy was I impressed. First off, they serve you the plates picnic style, paper plates with 3 dividers. The pork was salty and tangy, which was probably because it was vinegar based. But because it was chopped, it was so easy to eat. Their coleslaw has to be the best I've ever had. It comes out in a big spoonful and you taste the richness of the mustard. Also a big flavor burster: the celery. My trick was to take a forkful of the pork and place a small spoonful of the slaw right on top for one quick bite. I must've finished my plate in 20 minutes.  Now for their stew. It's a cross between a chili and a thick salsa, only warmer and more flavorful. It's actually pretty hard to describe. Honestly, I didn't think it went well with the pork and slaw but it was fantastic by itself. I finished my stew first before taking over the pork and slaw. One of us also ordered the fries and they were crispy and unsalted. Very very good.   Oh yea, CASH ONLY. And they are only open from 11/12PM - 4PM.   And the BEST hush puppies I've tasted so far. They look like fried mini cocktail weiners, only taste like soft falafel balls. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for some great sweet tea and some BBQ.  I always get a BBQ sandwich, but my dilemma is always what to order for a side.  Mac and cheese or fries.  Such a tough decision.  Both are great.  Pro tip: Don't eat all the hushpuppies before your meal gets there, I know you want to."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and the BBQ and Mac&Chz were great!!"}
{"text":"I found myself in his neck of the woods and decided to try this little BBQ place before driving to Raleigh.   I ordered the rib combo.  First off, service was amazing.  Ladies checked in and refilled drinks consistently.   The BBQ ribs were fall off the bones but they lacked salt and there wasn't that charred crispy bark on the ribs.  That's so hard to overlook.  Great place to try though and I would recommend this joint if you are in this area and in the mood for some 'que."}
{"text":"Damn fine BBQ, damn fine. The pork was wonderful - just enough smoke flavor to complement the smoothly rich whole hog pork. Vinegar based sauce may not be my favorite way to dress BBQ, but the meat came out lightly sauced. They have sauce on the table if you want more. The mustard slaw was nice, but the Brunswick stew was not to my taste - it was a bit too sweet and thick. I think it had green peas in it, which might explain the sweetness. Overall very good E Carolina BBQ, with a great staff serving it all up with a smile."}
{"text":"Hallelujah!!! I've finally found it!! I've been in Charlotte for a few years and since I moved here from Eastern NC I've been searching for some real BBQ, not this Western ketchup crap.I have finally found it. This stuff is the real deal. I got the pork BBQ sandwich combo with potato salad and Brunswick stew. Also came with a few hushpuppies. The BBQ was excellent. Moist and flavorful. Pulled and chopped like good pork BBQ should be. The potato salad was pretty good. Potatoes could have been chopped a little smaller and cooked a tad longer but that's just my personal preference. The Brunswick stew was also good. Hushpuppies were authentic, just a tad sweet corn taste with a little onion bite. But let's be real, the BBQ is the whole reason to come."}
{"text":"Really good little place.  I got a pulled pork plate.  The BBQ itself looks like it's been chopped into tiny bits, almost a puree.  But it is moist and tasty, not too smokey, but very flavorful, even without sauce.  They have several sauces (as decent BBQ places have).  Try the mustard-based sauce.  I loved it.  Sides are pretty typical.  Onion rings were great.  Service was very good, with a true family feel to it."}
{"text":"The pork BBQ was good, no doubt. However, you MUST have acquired a taste for Eastern NC BBQ, which is HEAVY in a VINEGAR sauce. I personally love the traditional sweet-style Southern BBQ. Now this is good pork-flavored BBQ. But I could only eat just so much of the vinegar. The portions were surprisingly small, as the sides were good but smaller than most BBQ joints. Overall, not bad. But there is MUCH better out there. If you love Eastern NC BBQ, you'll probably like this place much more than I did."}
{"text":"My fave bbq in charlotte. Exactly what I need and has a nice vinegar touch. Good service at home restaurant but also yummy food truck. Cheap and worth the money! Would recommend to anyone who likes vinegar based bbq, its hard to find!"}
{"text":"One of the last old school restaurants in Charlotte.  Up until the Montford takeover, I would go to the old smokehouse for my Que fix.  Now Bill Spoons is where its at.  Fantastic service, friendly greeting and they make you feel like a regular even if your not.    Dont expect an extravagant menu.  Chicken, pork and one fish item.  But heck, if you expected more then you obviously cannot appreciate the old fashion BBQ establishments.    Enjoy it! It is nothing short of down home greatness.  Ps.  They have eastern and western nc sauce and the counter lady is great.  As I am deciding on my sides she steps back and verbally puts my order in minus the sides so it will be working and I can leave faster.  Like duh, everybody should do that, but they dont.  Its official. \"Best onion rings in Charlotte!\"  Sweet Vidalia onions, cut thick, hand breaded and crunchy. But not crunchy batter wise, crunchy onion!   Cooked just right.  I dare you to prove me wrong, these are the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I had the chicken tenders, fries and Mac and cheese. My only complaint was the mac was slightly overcooked so the noodles were a tad mushy. The flavor of it was amazing though. My bf had the large BBQ plate with BBQ potatoes and Cole slaw. He loves everything. We would definitely go back!! Very home cooking type atmosphere and our waitress was awesome and super friendly."}
{"text":"First time goin and I got the fish plate. The mac n cheese stole the show though. I'll be goin again."}
{"text":"For a city the size of Charlotte, there's not much there in the way of outstanding barbecue. There are several adequate places, and there are even a couple that are good. But in the years that I've lived here, the only place that I have tried that I would call excellent is Mac's Speed Shop.  However, I kept hearing about Bill Spoon's Barbecue, so I decided to give it a shot one day for lunch.  Bill Spoon's Barbecue prides themselves on serving Eastern Carolina style barbecue by cooking the whole hog.  For those of you unfamiliar with the barbecue culture in North Carolina, Eastern Carolina style barbecue consists of cooking the entire hog, finely chopping the meat from the various parts of the pig, and serving it all together. The sauce is generally a very thin vinegar-based sauce.  I walk in and get seated and immediately feel at home.  The atmosphere was a very down-home comfortable atmosphere.  The tables all had yellow checkered tablecloths, and the wood paneling made me feel a bit nostalgic.  Bill Spoon's advertises serving the whole hog, so I decided to order the small barbecue plate with beans as my side.  The waitress was extremely friendly.  Less than five minutes later, out comes my plate of food!  Very quick!  The star of this plate is the pork.  It was chopped very fine, but the texture was not mushy at all.  I could see that some sort of sauce was applied to it, but the pork was not drowned in the sauce.  It had a very nice flavor.  I added some of the Eastern Carolina style sauce to the pork, and it added a nice bite with some kick.  I forgot to mention the hush puppies...  with every barbecue dinner, they have bottomless hush puppies!  WOOHOO!!  The hush puppies were extremely fresh -- nice and crunchy on the outside, and very moist on the inside.  The only drawback was that they were just a little bit on the salty side.  The slaw was something different that I had not experienced since starting my barbecue adventures -- it was a mustard-based slaw.  I would normally not eat a mustard-based slaw, but it complemented the barbecue quite well.  Thus, it did exactly what it was supposed to do.  The beans, quite frankly, were bland and mostly forgettable.  But I was hungry, and I ate them anyway.  I also read somewhere that they had excellent banana pudding, so I just had to try it out when I saw it available on today's menu.  When it came out, it was a little smaller portion than I had expected.  However, the taste of the banana pudding was very nice.  There were layers upon layers upon layers of wafers in the pudding, giving the pudding that nice crunch in addition to the pudding taste.  The pudding component was very fresh, although I kept wondering if I tasted just a faint hint of lemon in the pudding.  All in all, I enjoyed eating at Bill Spoon's.  I'm not sure it quite surpasses Mac's Speed Shop in the excellence factor, I have no qualms whatsoever in putting it in a solid 2nd place when it comes to the best barbecue in Charlotte.  This review is available with pictures at http://www.bigwaynerbbq.com/2011/03/26/review-bill-spoons-barbecue-charlotte-nc/."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and were greeted with southern hospitality.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, slaw on the side and it came with hush puppies.  We enjoyed the pork BBQ dry but with the vinegar sauce it elevated it to a new level.  It was the best sauce that I have had in a long time.  I had to buy a bottle to take home.  I loved the sandwich.  Hush Puppies had a perfect buttery flavor.  Slaw tasted like it was mustard based.  Not a fan of the mustard slaw.  In my opinion it was the best East North Carolina Style Barbeque I have had in a restaurant....."}
{"text":"By far the best chopped BBQ in Charlotte and I will argue that any day of the week.  I have been going to this place my whole life and I've tried every other BBQ place in Charlotte and no one can beat their chopped BBQ. Get a good ole fashion Chopped BBQ Plate and it comes with two sides. I usually go mac and cheese and French fries and don't forget the sweet tea, some of the best sweet tea in Charlotte as well. They also have the friendliest staff and the owner usually works the cash register. Can't beat that.   Love this place.  I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Bill Spoons is one of the best BBQ places I've ever eaten.  MAYBE the best.  I dunno.  I like all kinds of bbq and I'd hate to have to pick one to like forever.   Plus I miss Andy Nelson's horribly... but I digress.  I eat at Bill's every chance I get - which is once every other year or so, because the only time I'm in Charlotte is when I'm visiting family for the Holidays, and they've been known to go on vacation between Christmas and New Years.  Chopped pork?  I don't know how they do it but their chopped pork has, North Carolina vinegar sauce and all, more meat flavor than just about any I've tasted anywhere else.  They've got a bottle of hot pepper vinegar sauce (delicious) and a squeeze-bottle of regular sweet BBQ sauce (good but unnecessary) on each table.  Other meats I've tried are the BBQ chicken and the fried flounder.  The chicken is delicious, they use a similar sauce on it that they do on the ribs.  The white meat can get dry which doesn't bother me, but dry chicken frowners should probably stick to dark.  The flounder was as good as I've had anywhere (not that as a northerner I often get fried flounder).  They've just added ribs, and based on the one bite I got, I'm going to have to find an excuse to get back down there and try them for myself.  Sides... I love the potatoes, especially if you get there late and they've been soaking in that sauce for a while.  The Brunswick stew is a hearty meat&vegetable type one.  The collards are delicious - they actually still taste like greens rather than having been salted to death like so many place's collards.  Portion size?  Well, I got a large BBQ plate, ate myself sick, and had enough left over for breakfast the next day.  Only had room for dessert once while being down there, it was a slice of sweet potato pie - very good.  Service?  Never had a bad experience with anyone in there.  Everyone's smiling and friendly."}
{"text":"First Impressions: Smells like you're in a public restroom where they serve bbq.. oh and the decor.. dated and not much better than the smell.  I ordered the 1/2 bbq chicken, Mac n cheese, fried chicken sandwich, and grandmas apple pie.  Disclosure: I cannot eat pork due to religious reasons; although the rumors say that they have good pork.  The bbq chicken is cooked in the same manner as the pork (vinegar based bbq)so in the end I essentially got vinegar chicken; it tastes as bad as you would imagine. I'm still not quite sure who goes to a restaurant and says \"hmm I'll go with the vinegar chicken dish!\" The breast was also quite dry!  Oh I'd hoped that the Mac n cheese was at least okay, boy was I wrong! Bland and over-cooked! It was mush.  The fried chicken sandwich was okay 6/10 (edible, just add some sauce to it)  Grandmas apple pie! Oh she would be so disappointed.. the apples were rubbery.. too much sugar.. and the crust was mushy.. The frozen pie at the grocery store is leaps and bounds better than what I was served. My first bite was my last bite.  Even with my 50% off Groupon deal, I felt robbed. You couldn't pay me to eat here again; I honestly felt like I was being punished.   Worst meal of 2018  2/5 stars, in case they really do have good pork."}
{"text":"We were on our way from MD to Hilton Head. I have made it a point to visit BBQ on road trips. The reason we chose Bills's was because it all homemade and the unique yellow slaw (mustard & vinegar base). For us, to experience authentic NC pulled pork BBQ (they cook the whole pig:) with the yellow slaw combo was the best part. Followed by the amazing banana pudding, which is a must. Bill's is as close to walking back in time as anyone can hope for. Expect fast pace, plastic cups and lots of napkins."}
{"text":"Nothing could be finer than eating eastern Carolina BBQ  Guest from out of town were looking to get there BBQ on and my first instinct was to take them to Mac's. However, I wanted to bring them a taste of the Carolinas BBQ. Now the rest of the world thinks BBQ is ribs or brisket in a tomato based sauce. WRONG! I was naive at one time but found the errors in my ways.  Since Bill Spoon's is only a lunch time place during the week I figured this would be a great place to drop in. The best thing is Bill Spoon's have unlimited hush puppies since you can't stop at just an even dozen.  I can't believe it took me this long to try this local gem out!  The decor of this place is straight up Andy Griffith show. The wood panels take you back to that time called 1961. It has a charm of eating at grandpa and grandma's home. It is super clean too which appeals to my neat OCD ways.   The staff here was super friendly. The menu is very short and fits on half a page but lets face it the Carolina BBQ is the main attraction. This BBQ is very different is chopped pork with special spices. They even sell T-shirts as a great reminder of your meal.  So if you want to get the full Carolina BBQ experience check out Bill Spoon's!"}
{"text":"Wanted some authentic eastern NC bbq and decided on Bill Spoon's, just minutes away from where I am as staying.  Great choice.    Local family owned atmosphere, only one server running the floor.  Ordered the famous pork bbq and ribs.  Different from Texas bbq.  Dry rub ribs.  Vinegar based sauce.  Smoked just right and full of flavor.    Overall, very satisfying experience.   Sweet potato pie was delicious too."}
{"text":"Best bbq in Charlotte IMO.  Pork is chopped and true eastern style.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The food was really good the fish and ribs was tasty. The chicken needed a little more flavor but the Mac and cheese, collard greens and potato salad was amazing"}
{"text":"How is this place rated so highly? The beans are straight from a can. The potato salad is alright. The chopped up meat was decent though."}
{"text":"It saddens me to give Bill Spoon's a meager three starts, and I almost wonder if the fault lies with me, given that the place has been in operation longer than I have been alive. Service was good, and the banana pudding for dessert was delicious.  The three stars are the result of two other issues:   1) Spoon's is cash-only.  No one under a certain age carries cash any more.  I understand times have changed, but resistance leads to business loss after a while.  If I want barbecue for lunch while I am at work, I can go to Spoon's AFTER I go by the back, or I can travel roughly the same distance to Mac's without an ATM excursion on the way.  This would be less of an issue if Spoon's was far and away the best barbecue in the area, but this leads to my second point...  2) All the food served seemed to be pureed very finely.  The pulled pork barbecue and the Brunswick stew, although tasty, had the texture of baby food.  It got a little off-putting about halfway through the plate.  I feel like a jerk for dissing a family institution that has been around so long and is obviously run with love, but there it is."}
{"text":"Not too impressed but again I'm not used to north Carolina BBQ.  Service was great best fried pickles I've ever had"}
{"text":"Lived here for almost 10 years, this is the real deal.  In NC BBQ is serious, pork, nothing else.  This is Eastern NC (If you don't know what that means you need to do some homework) at its finest.  Bill runs the shop every day.  Not unusual too see local business power brokers in here ( Hugh McCall, etc) each day at lunch.  Hush puppies are wonderful , it's a can't miss in the Queen City.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in NC is right here.  We like to get a tub of it to go and then dress it up with our own spicy sauce at home.  Always tender, always delicious."}
{"text":"Wow. Why have you all been hiding this little gem from me?  Is it because I'm from Boston and you think that I wouldn't appreciate good eastern Carolina barbecue?  I'm more well-rounded than that, I swear!  As a northerner, I did think (way back in 2009) that barbecue involved meat (pig or beef) and some thick sweet sauce.  Eh.  Fine with me.  I enjoyed it but didn't love it.  Eating barbecue from Bill Spoon's has opened my eyes to a whole side of barbecue that I didn't know existed ... whole hog, vinegar based barbecue.  No more sticky sweet, ketchup based sauces for me.  No more fatty pork shoulder.  I am a whole hog Eastern Carolina cue girl from now on.        I am giving Bill Spoon's five stars for a few reasons ...   1.) Totally not pretentious.  Very helpful.  Family owned.  I walked in looking a little lost and Steve (current owner and the grandson of the original owner) said kindly, \"Sweetie, how can I help you?\"  Not 'sweetie' in a cloyingly paternalistic or condescending kind of way, but truly concerned that I needed some barbecue guidance.    2.) Tastes great!!  Large portions of deliciousness.  Steve suggested I order the family pack (about $18) - 1 pound of barbecue, a dozen hush puppies and a pound of cole slaw - enough to make three plates or five sandwiches.  I decided to also order an extra dozen hush puppies (very wise decision), some baked beans, 6 sandwich rolls, and 1/2 gallon of sweet tea.  This easily fed four adults and three children and cost a little over $30.        It is my new go-to place every time I have an out-of-town guest.  I can't seem to understand why Mac's has 132 reviews and this place has 22.  If you want a cool bar to hang out at and drink some organic hard cider for $7 a bottle, go to Mac's.  If you want delicious, authentic, barbecue goodness, go to Bill Spoon's.    Tucked in quaintly beside the Taco Bell on South Boulevard... let that be your beacon to guide you to barbecue heaven.  As other reviewers have mentioned... they are only open until 3pm and they only take cash, checks, and promises ... according to their sign.  Plan accordingly.  You can eat in or take your order to go...  If you plan to eat your takeout promptly, they will bring it out warm, if you plan to heat it up later, let them know!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try since it's been around so long.  Was sadly disappointed.  The slaw was sour, the meat was dry. The server was nice, but seemed to take offense that we couldn't finish our food and didn't really want to take it with us."}
{"text":"Eastern NC Style whole pig. They have a very good vinegar sauce to go along with the pork. All of their sides are very good. Their slaw is a yellow slaw - meaning mustard -. Their banana pudding one of the best around. If you are looking for ribs, brisket or sausage then you need to look elsewhere. But if you want a good Eastern NC type BBQ experience, this is your place in Charlotte.  TIP: Add some of the Vinegar Sauce to your Yellow Slaw. I promise you'll like it.  Update! Try their ribs. These really are some very good ribs. They come dry rub, they have a nice sauce you add once they are at your table. They are cooked well."}
{"text":"Bill Spoon's is a Charlotte institution. The interior looks like your grandmothers house. Old wood, old carpet, very homey, lived in feel.   They are known for their chopped style BBQ. Its all pork and is lean. They douse it in a Carolina style, vinegar sauce, which gives it a distinctive twang. You can of course ask for more sauce as you like. I'm a certified BBQ judge and while the pork is good, its not out of this world. Mine was on the dry side and the vinegar gave it more straight sour than highlighting the meat. I also got the ribs. They come with a thick sweet sauce. Again, nothing superb, but nothing terrible either. They too were a little dry, but more flavorful and smokey than the pork.  FYI, as of this posting, they are now only open for lunch."}
{"text":"With an average review of four stars, I expected A LOT more than what I got.  Anyone that gives this place four or five stars hasn't had killer barbecue food.  The pork looked like it has been through a food processor.  It was pulverized down to almost a pulp.  Flavor was pretty good, but definitely not great.  The chicken was good.  Had good flavor and fell right off the bone.  Unfortunately I chose the Mac and Cheese for my side.  Maybe it was cooked two days ago, maybe it was cooked yesterday.  Either way, it definitely wasn't fresh!  The cheese and butter had separated from the pasta completely.  Coleslaw was good, but again, was pulverized down to almost a pulp.  Not sure why the $10 lunch special includes hush puppies, but my $15 combo platter does not.  I went at 12:30pm, why wasn't the lunch special suggested?  On that note, service was definitely fast, but they weren't overly friendly.  Definitely better than one star, but three stars would be misleading for the rest of you."}
{"text":"If you are an old time Charlottean, do not be drawn by the Spoons BBQ name. This is nothing like the Spoons on South Boulevard in the 60's. Food is subpar, and that is being kind. Bleah, Meh, Ick."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte.  Excellent pulled pork, friendly staff.  A great place to introduce your family/friends to some real Eastern NC BBQ."}
{"text":"Solid, whole hog, eastern NC 'Q, which is a rarity west of Raleigh. Extremely crowded at lunchtime. Take note, because this is NOT a large place.  Reasonably priced food. Spoon's BBQ is easy to find. It ain't the best BBQ, but it's pretty damned good."}
{"text":"Best Carolina BBQ I have had. I am no expert, but not a novice either. Pulled pork is awesome. Great management and wait staff. Make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, for me, I did not find my meal deserved any better than the two stars. I would have loved this place to work out since I get high off of BBQ.  I ordered takeout for myself and a coworker and we both got the pulled pork plate with a side and cole slaw.  I assume their cole slaw has a bit of mustard in it since it is bright yellow.  I am more a fan of regular cole slaw.  We both had the side of the mac but it was very greasy.  I don't know what it was but the pork didn't come close to the spot for me.  I hate to say it about their BBQ since it seems a lot of people really enjoy it.  Sorry for the feedback but I wish nothing but good fortune to them."}
{"text":"Best place for eastern Carolina bbq! I love having to stay at my moms when she goes out of town bc I know what I'm getting for dinner every time! Delish, fresh and they are all so friendly! Build one in plaza midwood!"}
{"text":"This review is about the Spoon's Food Truck, not the physical location, which I will NEVER go to now.   I was at an event recently with food trucks, including this one, and not being very hungry, I wanted a hot dog and fries. The sign said $5.   I ordered, and the lady told me it would be $6.50. I pointed out the $5 price on the sign, and she curtly apologized, played with her tablet, then told me it would be $5.50.  I again pointed out the sign that said $5, and she briefly turned her tablet in my direction (like I knew where to look or could even see it in the bright daylight) and rudely told me that it was actually $5.50, and that I would need to give her 50 more cents.   I fumbled for another dollar in my pocket, and told her that she should change the sign as they're currently falsely advertising. She got up and changed it right after tending to me.   I'm posting pictures showing the sign, before and after the change. And to top it off, the hot dog wasn't even good. The $0.75 dogs at IKEA are much better.   Will never do business with these rude people again."}
{"text":"Coming from the South I am very particular about my barbecue but Bill Spoon's Barbecue met my expectations and then some.  Before walking in I was told this place had been around for ages, so I thought they must be doing something right.  Boy was I right!  When I walked in, a soft smile came upon my face as it reminded me of my grandmother's house in the little town of Florence, South Carolina; very dated, original, yet ever so warming.    I was greeted with a smile and seated fast, Ricky Bobby fast.  Once seated the waitress asked if we needed a minute.  I looked down at the menu and saw the daily special was $11 which included BBQ, fresh coleslaw, choice of fixin', hushpuppies and a drink; even Howie Mandel would of said thats a deal.  The food came out quick and I have to say I was shocked. The BBQ looked amazing, finely chopped and juicy. I ate a piece without my fork, I couldn't wait. My choice of fixin' was mac n' cheese, it was so stringy just how I like it. The coleslaw was interesting, since I have never had mustard base before, however, I tried it and found out it wasn't my thing.  The hush puppies were crispy and soft.  But, what really stood out to me was the service; the service the entire time was more on point than a German Shorthair on a pheasant.  Filling waters and asking if everything was well the entire time, showed true southern charm.    After I ate all my food, I asked if they had a wheelbarrow to roll me out. Apparently they get that a lot and they threw me in one and wheeled me to my car.  That is not true, but if I had asked they would have. Now that's customer service!  Lastly, I would like to know where I could find Bill Spoon? I would like to sit on a porch somewhere and crack open a cold one and eat some BBQ with him. Thank you Bill and the people who work here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bill Spoons BBQ and here are the reason why this will be a regular place to visit. (I am hard to please...)  1. The wait staff are genuinely nice... and not that fake Disney nice. I like it when a server offers a suggestion on what they like. I know, I know, everybody has their tastes but it does help to offer an opinion.  2. Comfort food... oh my, tasty hush puppies (handmade I hear), delicious BBQ potatoes (this was new to me), great sides... the list goes on.  3. I left out the pulled pork on purpose... it's because it deserves it's own spot. It's simply fantastic!!! I read a few reviews that didn't care for the pork (come on, they are from California... 'nuff said) but I know eastern Carolina \"que\" and this is a masterpiece. The meat was moist through and through and the quality was great... no weird chunks of meat that didn't belong there... it's as if it was prepared with care. I stand up and applaud Bill Spoon's Restaurant... bravo!!!  So, the bottom line, if you want to go out someplace where you want to feel wanted, the food is good, AND the prices reasonable get your butt down there!  ;-)"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is pretty good and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Considering I am not from this area this means that Carolina style BBQ is not the first option for me.  I look for a pit cooked pulled pork bbq that has been basten in water, vinegar and spices for extended periods and then top it off with a thick bbq sauce with a slight mustard hit to it."}
{"text":"This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken.   The atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff.  I hope to return soon and update my review ( :"}
{"text":"I love Seattle. But one thing we don't have here is Eastern Carolina style barbecue. In fact, most of the world doesn't have it, and that's a sad, sad thing. See, growing up in the Midwest, I was always under the impression that barbecue sauce was sweet, sticky, smoky and thick. It wasn't until my decade in the South that I learned different. And I've never gone back.  Now what I want is a pile of shredded pork, some slaw, and some beans, to savor the textures and flavors of each bite together. I don't want to see any sauce, and that's where the magic of Carolina barbecue comes in. Light, with a vinegar/mustard/garlic base, it's a gentle addition to the meat, with plenty on the side for you to add to make it as wet as you want. It's heaven: tangy, brisk, a little spicy, and delicately robust. Su-per-la-tive.  So on the North Carolina visit, barbecue was on the food docket. Bill Spoon's BBQ came recommended as the closest to what I wanted, and this was a wonderful spot. Dark, old, cheap wood paneling inside, and checked yellow tablecloths with patrons out of the old South talking in their once-familiar accents told me I was in a good spot for tradition. And out the plates came, just paper with a pile of pork, beans, and mustard slaw all in their appointed sections. And...the big bottle of more sauce in the middle of the table. Plus, a couple of baskets of hush puppies: perfectly crisped and fried outside, perfectly delectable inside. Oh, and a big yum to the banana pudding, as others have noted.  A few other things to note: cash only, lunch only, and you can definitely do take-out.  But I have to say...the three stars are only because as wonderful as Bill Spoon's is, I found somewhere that was even better, a little more suited to exactly what I was looking for. However, I'd head back on my next visit for sure, and you should too! Plus, it's quite near the Tyvola LYNX station, so it's easy access to excellent 'cue."}
{"text":"During our road trip this past April, I made sure to build in a spot for authentic Carolina style BBQ.  Bill Spoon's won out after some research, and we visited for lunch one sunny afternoon.  I, of course, ordered the BBQ platter (BBQ = pork and nothing else) and was not disappointed.  The meat was tender and the sauce was nice and vinegary.  The sides were delicious as well - I ordered the beans and mac and cheese.  We were also brought over some hush puppies, which were warm and crispy.    The place is a step back in time, from the wall paper to the waitresses.  Everything adds to the ambiance of the place, but the real star is the pork."}
{"text":"Lucky enough to run into Mama Spoon for my first visit, and even though my husband and I were splitting a rack of ribs, she insisted that we try the pulled pork, mac and cheese and collard greens, and sent complimentary samples to the table. It was some of the best mac and cheese that I've had in Charlotte. I'm a Northerner and used to red tangy sauce on my ribs, not .the truly dry rub Spoons uses. But the pulled pork (what Carolinians call barbecue) was absolutely delicious. And that vinegar and pepper sauce? Goes great on everything. I'll be back--for the bbq and the super friendly service."}
{"text":"Hubs and I both had the small pork plate and it was good, not the best BBQ that I've had, but definitely good.  However, everything else was superbly tasty.  The mac & cheese was soft and thick with a very good cheddar taste.  The coleslaw was sweet, tangy, and yellow with mustard.  We're from farther south and I've never had coleslaw like it before.  I thought it was awesome.  My MIL had chili cheese fries that she and Hubs loved it.  The banana pudding was some of the best banana pudding that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Charlotte is known for getting eastern NC style bbq very very wrong. The one exception that I know of is Bill Spoons. They get Eastern NC style right. To Amanda who didn't like the chopped nature of the meat, that is actually how a lot of NC bbq is prepared. To some it's just not appealing (I can understand that) but it's just how it's made. Bottom line - if you like Eastern NC style then you'll enjoy Bill Spoon's. Sadly Mr. Spoon passed a few years ago. He was kind of an institution around here - known for his friendliness. His grandson and family are keeping things going and are doing a great job. Still a very friendly place with great food.  To Dave: in my initial review I wrote that Dave's claim that this location used to be  Bubba's was wrong. Via an email, Dave clarified that in fact it was initially Bill's then was Bubba's for awhile and then was Bill's again. I appreciate that and want to apologize for my error. I think the pics on the wall of the place as Bill's from the 70s/80s threw me. Thanks to Dave for also letting me in on some interesting history of the building too. I wonder though . . . what became of Bill Spoons during this Bubba period? Was he out of the business for a while?"}
{"text":"Spoon's BBQ truck made an appearance at work today. As always, great service, great food. I got a Jordan dog with only chili, cheese, and bbq - it was perfect. Mac and Cheese amazing as always. Thank you for withstanding the heat and coming out!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue and great prices. We had the pulled pork with Carolina sauce, Mac n cheese and hush puppies. All excellent. The place was very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"This is the first place in Charlotte (or most of the Western half of the state for that matter) that I can actually say has good BBQ.  Every other place the Q tasted like nothing or poorly ventalated natural gas fumes.  It's not the best Q  I've had (Browns - Kingstree, SC) but it's really good and better than anything else I've had in the area.  It's open for lunch only and no credit cards."}
{"text":"Had to try out Bill Spoon's for a quick lunch while in the area for work. If you like a straightforward, no frills, family-owned place, this is for you. You have a relatively straightforward menu, and you've got to get the chopped pork. It is very tender with good moisture already mixed in with their vinegar base (very slightly spicy), and you can kick it up with some of the sauces they have on the table (both vinegar and tomato base styles). The sides are good too, with everything from hush puppies, collards, mac and cheese, and slaw.  Pricing is very reasonable, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.  Would definitely recommend Bill Spoon's for anyone looking for a no-frills, solid Carolina BBQ experience."}
{"text":"If you seek to fill out your barbecue scorecard, Bill Spoon's is definitely a stop you need to make.  Many of those newfangled places will tell you that you need pulled pork (generally longer strands of meat, often piled high on the plate).  Not here.  You get chopped pork instead - minced into tiny pieces so that it is almost unrecognizable.  You definitely know that it is meat, and the taste is unmatched.  As has been mentioned, you can get something similar at Bubba's if you are up that way.  If I recall, Bubba was a cook for Spoon's way back when, which explains the similarity in cooking styles.  The slaw is different than many, but I actually enjoy it - one of the few places I will eat slaw.  And though they did not accept anything but cash until recently, they now take cards and are even open for dinner a few nights a week.  Awesome."}
{"text":"My sister was visiting from out of country, and I decided to give her an \"American\" experience. After reading all the reviews, I decided this would be a great authentic spot. Oh boy... Where we disappointed?!!! The pork was cold and barely warm. I didn't care about the sauce, it was very sour. I know its vinegar base, but it felt like somebody just took some red wine vinegar and poured all over the meat. Mac and cheese seemed that it was sitting in the pan all day long, and the bits and pieces were scraped in my plate. It was greasy, and cheese was clumpy. Gross! The only reason I am giving two stars were hush puppies. They were delicious, and the waitress was super sweet and kept on refilling our baskets.  I love little local family dives, but this place was a miss. I was hoping the reason was because we came after 2pm when the lunch crowd was gone, so even though it felt like we were eating last nights leftovers, hopefully it's better during the busy hours."}
{"text":"If you like eastern north carolina BBQ, you'll be in heaven.  I don't care too much for mustard slaw and vinegar based BBQ sauce so that's why this place is only A-OK.    Spoons is simple BBQ.  Much like the much heralded Lexington BBQ, Spoons serves chopped BBQ on disposable plates and has excellent desserts.  I had the BBQ sandwich with slaw on top and found it to be pretty good.  The hush puppies are awesome.    I did spring for dessert which was sweet potato pie that day and YUM.  Nothing better than a hot slice of heaven with whipped cream on top.    If you're looking for an example of Carolina BBQ, you must pay a visit to Spoons."}
{"text":"I love this place. There is much heated debate about the best bbq out there and I know everyone has their own preference...but to me, Bill Spoon's is one of the best. I clean my plate every time I go there. The slaw, hushpuppies, sweet tea and bbq are ALL excellent. Another thing I like about this place is that the first time I went I had a debit card. THEY ONLY TAKE CASH & checks ! Remember that. But even if you forget, they'll tell you just to pay it next time. I know I looked like I'd seen a green monkey land on his head when he said that. \"He\" being Bill Spoon's grandson-possibly the nicest individual you'll ever meet. Everyone there is a sweetheart.   Now, let's talk about atmosphere. This place ain't swank. Far from it. It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall joint with checkered tablecloths and old decor. Personally, I kinda like it-it goes with my world view of what an authentic, family owned, bbq place should look like. My husband, on the other hand, thinks it feels like an old folks home. He does, however, love the food.  The place has been around forever (since 1963 I think), so I think that says something too."}
{"text":"Bill Spoon's BBQ is a small hole in the wall restaurant in Charlotte owned and operated by the Spoon's family.  I have actually been going here with my grandparents since I was 10 or 11 years old.    Spoon's has a small group of extremely loyal customers who have been visiting the location for several decades.  They retain customer loyalty not only because of the ridiculously tasty barbecue, but also because each member of the staff radiates a warm small town friendliness that makes each customer feel special and appreciated.  The barbecue itself is definitely the best that I have ever tasted.  They avoid using any heavy tomato based barbecue sauce.  Instead they blend peppers and spices into the pork and keep the meat its original color.  They offer their homemade barbecue sauce as a side item along with a homemade spicy vinegar creation that can be easily imitated but never duplicated.  Make sure you stop by this place next time you are in Charlotte.  It is a one of the most popular small restaurants in town.  Spoon's is almost a local celebrity, who is always spoken about during conversations concerning great barbecue."}
{"text":"So deliscious. We are not from the south but enjoy some good bbq, and this place did not disappoint. Its about the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I guess this place has been here since before your Momma met your Daddy.  It is definitely hit or miss though.  If I'd only got the ribs, this would've been a 2 star rating.  The ribs were extremely bland.  No smoke ring to be seen.  Should've been more suspicious when a place has been around for forever and ribs were listed as \"new\" on the menu.  DO NOT GET THE RIBS! Moving on, the pulled pork was awesome.  Their vinegar sauce plus the pulled pork was so good.  Get that if you come here, for sure.   The mac n cheese, skip it.  Oily. Hush puppies were good. The cole slaw is a mustard based one, and it wasn't bad, just not my thing. Oh, and you guys might think it a minor thing, but they had the best freaking sweet tea.  Very strong, and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"First, vinegar based.  Must know that. No brown sugar, tomato, molasses mix here.  What they serve is finely chopped (almost blended and pureed) and is very dry, dry like it has been sitting under a heat lamp all day.  I have tried it several times and just never have been impressed.  For good BBQ, try Mac's instead."}
{"text":"I got the small plate. The pork and tangy sauce was tasty. I loved the mustardy Cole slaw! The hush puppies and sweet tea were delicious. Not a fan of the mac & cheese or the pecan pie.  The service was wonderful. My sweet tea never got below half full and they gave me a second helpful of the hush puppies! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Solid food. Good pork and baked beans, not a fan of the Mac and cheese. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!"}
{"text":"I've been to many BBQ places in the Carolinas and I still think Bill Spoons is the best."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a friend's wedding. Since it was my first time in North Carolina, I couldn't miss the opportunity to try some North Carolina BBQ. I turned to my trusted yelpers and found Bill Spoon's.   I ordered their lunch special, which comes with pulled pork, mustard coleslaw, a side, hush puppies and a drink. I found the pork a bit dry. I came with no sauce on it, just plain dry pulled pork. The lady told me to use the watery-looking vinegar bbq sauce, which did not make the pork any more moist. I finally had to ask for the  the thick sauce (the one you normally see at the store). I had to pour a lot in there for the pork to taste not as dry. The mustard coleslaw was really good if you like the taste of yellow mustard. The hush puppies were amazing - perfect golden brown on the outside and moist inside. The sweet tea was awesome and they give it to you in a to-go cup so you can refill it before you leave and take it with you.   Overall, maybe I was expecting too much and got disappointed. This was definitely nothing home to write about."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bill's on my way through. It is tasty meat (chopped-up pork). The sauce is the vinegar style. Serve was good and everyone was friendly. ~$10 for a plate of food including lots of hush-puppies. Yum."}
{"text":"Finally made it here, well I made it to Bill Spoon's BBQ - I ate in this building light years ago when it was Bubba's (of course, before it was Bubba's, it was Spoon's Barbecue - a certain symmetry exists even in the world of cooked pig.). Signs says \"We've cooked the whole pig since 1963\", and if that is a collective \"We\", then that is true.  They serve pretty solid Eastern NC barbecue here - they cook the whole pig till it is tender and juicy, moderately chop it & include some outside pieces, and lightly sauce it as served. What arrives at the table is fairly mild barbecue, and several large dashes of their sauce helps pick up the heat pace - this is a nice Eastern NC sauce.  The slaw is also very Eastern - mustard based with a little attitude, and goes great with the pork, and the BBQ Chicken, as well. The BBQ Chicken is nice and tender, but it is very mild, and benefits a great deal from a nice amount of salt, and some additional sauce, house or commercial hot sauce. The Combo Plate of  BBQ Chicken, 7 ounces of Chopped BBQ, and 2 sides goes for $14.75, not exactly cheap eats here. Chopped Sandwich is $5. The Hushpuppies here are very, very good.  The Chili Dog here is not one I'd order again - the chili lacks any kick, the onions go on last (just wrong), and at $2.50 this is an expensive wiener. The side of Onion Rings was actually nice - these are obviously frozen, but they were well fried, not over breaded, and had some good onion flavor. The FF were thin and crispy - nice. The Brunswick Stew ($4 for a small bowl) was simply awful - too thick and mushy (you cannot identify a single separate vegetable), and was very dark with a burnt, bitter taste. Your soda comes in a 12 ounce can, and there are no refills - cost is $2.  The service was quick, efficient, and friendly. They check on you several times during the meal. This is not destination barbecue in my opinion, but it is pretty good, especially for the Charlotte area. This is not a cheap place to eat barbecue, especially at the lunch meal. A BBQ Chicken/Pork Combo Plate with 2 sides, a small Brunswick Stew, a Chili Dog, an order of FF, and 2 Diet Cokes came to $27.10 before tax or tip. Too expensive for the combined quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Great southern bbq. Nothing fancy, but just right in all the right places. Family owned and humble as hell, I felt like I was at someone's house. Thumbs up.  Checkered red vinyl tablecloth? Check. Paper plates? Check. Sweet tea in those crystal plastic cups? Check. Waitresses that call you hon'? Check"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I wanted this experience to be great. It just wasn't.  I got my lunch to go and the employees were all very helpful and welcoming. I ordered a lunch special - bbq pork, cole slaw, macaroni and cheese, hush puppies and a drink. My order was to go and it was ready very quickly.   Here is my run down of the food: - the pork: the flavor was okay but I didn't love that the meat was \"chopped\" so finely that it was pretty much minced. I prefer more of a pulled pork. - cole slaw: weird yellow color and weird taste. Not a fan. - macaroni and cheese: it was this strange hybrid of firm and clumpy. The consistency was just not appealing and the noodles were mushy. On top of that, it was very oily (in fact, you can see in the picture how the oil from it went into the cole slaw) - hush puppies: bland and tasteless - threw them away  Despite the great service, the food leaves much to be desired. I threw away most of my food and accepted that I wasted my money that meal. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's simple, satisfying, and reasonably priced. My mouth is still swimming in the tangy taste of vinegar and swine, I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit in the chair inside the restaurant... Why? Because I know the food coma is coming and I want to make sure I get this out first... lol  Good grief, y'all... First of all, the hush puppies that come out when you get here... So crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside... The batter is top notch! Love it! We tried the fried pickles and they were decent... But I'm a hard fried pickle judge... The boyfriend tore them up, though... :)   I had the special and it was fan-fricking-tastic! The barbecue, two sides and a drink... The sauces were equally delicious... I loved the vinegar/peppery one and the tomato based sauce had great balance, so it wasn't too sweet... The baked beans were some of the best I've ever had and the collard greens were a hit... Especially with the vinegar sauce on them!    Too bad I won't have any room for dessert, but good thing I live close enough to come later..."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get bbq in Charlotte - actually anywhere.  You cannot go wrong with the pork plate with brunswick stew and slaw. Also, unlimited hushpuppies?  Yes please.  Best place in CLT, no question."}
{"text":"I went to lunch at Bill Spoon's Barbecue on a Saturday after noon.  Their hours (M-Sat 10:30am - 3pm) make it tough to try this place out.  It was worth the wait.  This place is a throw back or hold over from the old school BBQ joints.  Nothing fancy, but clean and well maintained.  They only serve whole hog pork and chicken here.  I ordered the large plate which comes with slaw and a side.  I chose the brunswick stew.  My order was brought out to me in about a minute or two after I ordered.  They serve the dinners on paper plates and if you order a soda you get a can with a plastic cup of ice.  Like I said this is old school BBQ.  The pork is chopped fine.  It was moist, tender, and had a great flavor.  The only BBQ sauce available is a thin vinegar based sauce.  I tried some of it on the pork and it gave the meat a nice tang.   This is the best BBQ pork I have had since I have been here in Charlotte.  The slaw is vinegar based, crunchy and tangy.  This was the first time I have had brunswick stew and it was very tasty.  All dinners are served with hush puppies which is a good and happy thing.  I have always loved hush puppies and these were excellent.  The servers were friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.  When they suggested a banana pudding for dessert I readily agreed.  The pudding made a good creamy end to a great lunch.  A quick note I am from the Kansas City area and I have eaten at some of the greatest BBQ places there.  I also judge BBQ contests and have judged 28 contests over the past 3 years.  Bill Spoon's will be added to my list of the best BBQ places I have eaten.  If you are looking for something fancy or sweet sticky BBQ, then head elsewhere.  If you want old school BBQ then this is the place.  Oh, and make sure to bring cash as they don't take plastic."}
{"text":"I'm between 4 and 5 stars here. I went here for lunch 6 years ago and wasn't all that impressed. At the time, I didn't like vinegar based bbq sauces that much and that was all they had. I now love vinegar based bbq sauces and saw there was a Groupon so I decided to give it another chance. I loved it this time around. The vinegar sauce was very good, but it does have a kick to it. I'm not a fan of spicy food though, so take that with a grain of salt. They also have a non-vinegar sauce now which was pretty good too. They give you baskets of hush puppies which is always the sign of a good bbq place.   We got the chopped pork plate and the half rack of ribs. The chopped pork was great (although I do like pulled better), but I didn't really like the ribs. They were ok, but I ended up not eating most of them to save room for dessert. I don't think they're worth the price since the chopped pork was better and cheaper.   We got sides of bbq potatoes, coleslaw, mac and cheese, and baked beans. The bbq potatoes were interesting and pretty good. The coleslaw was good, pretty standard slaw. The mac and cheese was definitely the star of the sides and was great with the baked beans.   The banana pudding for dessert was amazing. It was a small portion, perfect for one person after a big meal (or to share if you're full).   I'll definitely be coming back for lunch! It's a really good traditional bbq place which is hard to find in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I was greeted and sat immediately. Order fried pickles as an app. They were good but could benefit from more breading and a little more crispy. In my opinion, of course. For my entree, I ordered a small bbq plate with Mac and cheese. It came pretty quick which was great. The bbq was tasty, my only wish was more sauces besides the two on the table. The Mac and cheese wasn't great. Had a weird after taste. The slaw was great. For dessert(because if you're gonna ruin your diet, might as well ruin it completely) I ordered apple pie with ice cream. Served warm.(assuming you can order the pie cold, as she asked) it was delicious! The service was great. All my needs were met without asking. I appreciate that in a restaurant. I recommend this place but maybe not the Mac and cheese. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this Eastern Carolina style Bar B Que.  Let me say the service was great.  No problems there but the food?  Yeech. I started ordering a Pepsi..... which they don't have despite the fact the menu board over the front/carry out counter has pepsi logo's on it.  You get cans of coke instead.  At least they'll give you another can if you need it and you'll need it to wash down this meal.  I can only guess Eastern Carolinians are missing a lot of teeth, I say that because of the way this so-called Eastern Carolina Bar B Que and the sides are made.  The pork.  This stuff has been sliced, diced and chopped to within 1\" of being a pork Pate you could spread on Ritz crackers with a butter knife.  Seriously, it's been mutilated to the point it's become tasteless.  Don't think the sauces save it either.  The 2 bottles on the table, vinegar based and a tomato based are no help for this meat.  Whomever thought dumping vinegar onto tasteless diced pork was a great idea is nuts.  I was coughing, choking and gasping for air taking the first bite with that stuff.  I wound up dumping quite a bit of the tomato based sauce, which could've come out of any store bought bottle, to cover up the vinegar. What a sad fate for the poor pig that became a meal for someone at Bill Spoons.  Coleslaw.  here we go again.  Chopped up so fine it's nearly like eating grits.  And yellow?  Mustard in Coleslaw?  Completely forgettable.  Potato salad.  I found maybe 3 small pieces of potato in the salad, basically it was a mustard based mush that tasted much like any store deli potato salad except lacking potato's.  Seriously, can anyone down here chew anything or does everything have to be chopped and diced into goop?  The Hush Puppies were the saving grace as was the apple pie but neither could save this meal.  If you're used to Bar B Que from just about anyplace other than Eastern Carolina I'd suggest staying away from here."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot to say other than this was the best BBQ I have ever had.  Everything about it was killer.  Got the pork plate with a side of potato salad and a cried real tears when I finished them.  If you are looking for a nice place though, this isn't for you. Its an old school building and the decorations leave much to be desired but I go to places like this for the food, not the environment.   Stop reading this and go to Bill Spoon's. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better."}
{"text":"Hell yeah.   Went around 11:00 on a Monday afternoon for an early lunch. The place was dead but, started to fill up with business-type lunch people at noon. Try to go a little earlier or later if you want to beat the rush.   Service was great. Sodas come per can and likely aren't refillable. I'm sure this causes great strife among many patrons but seriously folks, if you're downing multiple cokes per sitting you need a support group, not a Yelp account.   I had the pork BBQ sandwich, with the coleslaw on it, as I'm not some sort of plebeian. The meat was FANTASTIC. It didn't need a single thing but, I added a bit of the wonderful, thin, vinegar-based sauce that's on the table. The thicker, Kansas City-style sauce was typical. Don't use that, though! You're in NC! With my sandwich I had Mac n Cheese (good!) and Brunswick stew (not good!).   Boyfriend had the same sandwich but, with potato salad and beans. Potato salad was good, very reminiscent of Publix's. The beans were good too but, not epic or anything.   We started with onion rings and finished with banana pudding. The onion rings were some of the best I have had. The banana pudding was recently assembled and pretty lousy. I guess no one makes the layered, traditional, Nilla-Box recipe anymore? BBQ places always seem to have half-assed banana pudding...  Anyway- very authentic shredded pork, good sides and nice hush puppies, too. Service is great BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR SODA REFILLS so, keep this in mind if you're a coke-fiend."}
{"text":"- Customer service rating!!!  So I went back today to pick up my banana puddin. The staff there was super, super nice. After I said pudding, they knew exactly what I was talking about.  When the fellow brought the pudding out, he apologized profusely. He then started punching in stuff on the register and pulled out $3.30. I was like woah, I dont need that, its okay.  I tried to say no, but he wouldn't take it back.   He then said the magic words \"it never should have happened.\" I eat out a lot, I mean a lot and I've never heard those words uttered in the restaurant biz. WOW! I mean, my fault too for not checking the bag but sheesh! Now I feel guilty, lol.  Oh the pudding. It's good. Nila wafers - come on, who doesn't like Nila wafers? Even asian kids like me grew up on Nila Wafers!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I last tried Bill Spoon's Barbecue. I knew that my recent trip to Charlotte would be an opportunity to try it once again and I was as excited as a kid on Christmas Morning as I pulled into their parking lot. As I was ordering a large Chopped Pork Plate I was happy to remember once time a few years ago at this same restaurant, a friend and I enjoyed our pork plate so much we ordered a second plate each on the spot!!! Once it arrived, I was already eating and enjoying their world famous hush puppies, I was ready for my Chopped Pork. Of course it was as good as I remembered. Excellent in fact! Eastern Style! One thing that I didn't like at all was their Cole Slaw. It looked and tasted like it was mustard based. There is a very small group of folk in the Carolinas who like this type of cole slaw. I don't know why Bill Spoon's doesn't offer different cole slaws. After one taste I left the rest of my cole slaw untouched. It's yellow/green an unappealing to me. But I assure you EVERYTHING ELSE...the Chopped Pork, The hushpuppies, the fries, the sweet tea... Well, I could eat that lunch 5 times a week! I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this in NC! I came here about 10 minutes before closing and expected people to grumble when I walked through the door but the entire staff acted genuinely happy to see a customer.  I ordered the bbq platter with pulled pork, cole slaw, greens and hush puppies along with a side of ribs to see how those were.  Everything, I mean everything blew me away.   Highlights: -The pulled pork was perfectly moist and flavorful as it gets  - the sauce that they serve is PHENOMENAL.  It was a ever so slightly sweet vinegar based sauce that had a great spicy kick to it.  This is without a doubt my favorite representation of Carolina bbq sauce. -the hushpuppies were perfectly seasoned, fresh and crisp. if you like hush puppies you will die for these. -the ribs were cooked to perfection with very moist meat that still adhered to the bone.  great rub applied too  This place completely changed my opinion on NC bbq. Great job guys keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've lived within a mile of this joint for over 37 years, and in the same general area for my entire life, and have eaten here twice.  Nuff said!  Horrible barbeque at high prices pretty much sums up Bill Spoons.  How he stays in business is anyone's guess."}
{"text":"Yelp ratings were right, this is a solid 4 stars and rising. Their signature dish the Pulled Pork is so moist and delicious. If you like a little more tang you add some of the vinegar dressing thats on the table. You have choices for side dishes. I ordered the Cole Slaw w Mustard (gotta try it!) and Baked Beans. They also have these unusually tasty Hush Puppies that were so good we ordered a 2nd helping. I even ordered the Key Lime pie and thank god I was full or I might have ordered the Bread Pudding to. Me and my Cholestrol like this place so I should be glad I don't live here. I would have to buy more of those \"relaxed fit\" pants. Great food, service, clean and tremendous value. They are closed by 8 so don't be late! Rock on Bill Spoons, I'm  coming back again some day."}
{"text":"With or without sauce, the chopped pork bbq sandwich is great! Hush puppies, fried okra, and sweet tea were southernly spot on. Charming and quick service were the sweetest! ;)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch for my first ever visit today. Had 30 minutes till my next conference call and was in and out in less than 20 minutes. Had the small BBQ (BBQ = pork here in Eastern NC) plate with a mustard based slaw on the side.   It was good eastern style, whole hog cue. I was relieved to know I can get EXACTLY the same meal way closer to Huntersville at Bubba's on Sunset Rd. Seriously. The pork and slaw looked and tasted identical!  That's not a bad thing as I think both are good. If I'm on this side of town, I'd certainly go back to Spoon's."}
