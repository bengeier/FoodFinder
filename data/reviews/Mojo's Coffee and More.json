{"text":"As a resident of bay village, I am about to commit blasphemy: I DONT LIKE MOJOS. There, I said it. I've never really been impressed by the decor and the place has a weird smell. The coffee has never impressed me either, but today I was totally disgusted when my cookie from their vegan bakery had a hair in it. Also, it was a pretty terrible cookie overall. I threw out my cappuccino because I found it disgusting, probably because I was still retching from the hair incident, but it's the only cappuccino I've ever had without foam...so I guess it was a crappy latte???
I'm all for small businesses but if they closed up and opened a Starbucks there tomorrow, I'd be the first in line."}
{"text":"Have to agree with other reviewers. It's great to have a local coffee shop and the atmosphere is perfect- big tables, sunshine, play area for the kids and even a water dish outside for dogs. The coffee.. Well it isn't perfect but they definitely try to have options for everyone. My husband loves sweet drinks and always enjoys buckeye mochas, etc. I stick with an iced Americano, and do so more than happily since I can walk over and read or work in such a nice environment."}
{"text":"Went to Mojos today for the first time. Coffee and tomato mozzarella sandwich were delicious! Definitely will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, great atmosphere (decorated for the holidays), and lots of space, including an outdoor patio.  This is a great neighborhood coffee shop for catching up with friends, getting work done, or simply just to relax.  The food is also pretty good, especially the pastries.  The staff is welcoming and helpful and goes to great lengths to accommodate all patrons.  We will be frequent visitors."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. Great Americano and relaxed atmosphere.  Definitely recommend and will return again."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff and good food options. Good for in and out when on the go and comfortable if you want to hang out for awhile."}
{"text":"The bakery is fresh and Mojo's offers gluten free/vegan! Mojo's also has delicious and fun hippie cookies from a local bakery in Lakewood. Breakfast, salads, wraps, and sandwiches are available ALL DAY! The dill spread is out of this world! A lot of house made items here. The coffee is amazing and Mojo's changes the flavor blend everyday! A lot of updates have been happening lately! Definitely a cool place to hangout!!"}
{"text":"As the only place in Bay to get coffee options... I need to give it an honest review in hopes the owner reads this and can make some staff changes. The women that work here are just a little weird and unfriendly. They also seem like they are so busy and really there could just be one person at the counter. They don't make any effort and never act as though they recognize you. It's just a weird experience. The ambiance is great, love the fireplace and the coffee cake is delish."}
{"text":"So far liking what I'm seeing! First time here, but the staff is super friendly, the selection of food and drink is really good, and the atmosphere is great. I had a frappe (it's HOT out today) and its on par with my favorite coffee shop of all time. Makes me wish I lived closer!! This might turn into a pilgrimage site. ;)"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed Mojo's yet? Ok, here I go. I give it four stars NOT for the coffee, but for the combination of a) delicious pastries, both vegan and non-; b) the friendly staff, and c) the ample study/hangout space. They even have a place for kids to be annoying in a semi-secluded corner, with toys and books.

I enjoy the atmosphere here, and although their coffee and lattes are just \"eh,\" I will return again and again."}
{"text":"Usually when a place wins a, \"Best of the West\" designation I have to check it out.  Mojo's upstaged Cravings this year so I decided I have to experience myself since I had never been there.  Cool interior design.  Lots of seating inc,using counter seating at the window.  Some baked goods are baked in house.  They offer a range of gluten free options and some vegetarian/vegan options which is great.  Ladies at the counter were friendly and brought my coffee out to me which was a nice gesture.  My latte was good.  I wouldn't say great.  Is it a better experience overall than Cravings?  Tough to say.  Both are great for different reasons.  I will give the edge to Mojo's because the environment feels more comfortable.  And Mojo's doesn't attract all those loud men who play checkers!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite coffee shops around!! the environment is nice & easy to study at. the staff is also extremely friendly & fast"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mojo's. I have been frequenting this location for about 8 years because it is conveniently located within walking distance of my house. I love the atmosphere of this coffee shop. The monthly/weekly specials are always to die for. I usually try something new every time I go. I recently had a delicious monthly special that consisted of their cold brew with a house-made lavender simple syrup. All I can say is YUM!


Their pastries are always delicious and I love that they have vegan options widely available. The staff is always friendly and top-notch just in general! I've even ordered lunch here a few times and have always enjoyed the Mediterranean veggie wrap that they have on menu.

This location is perfect for doing homework or sitting on the patio in the warmer months. Friend and I often go here to catch up. I definitely recommend trying Mojo's out!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here for my son's first birthday party. Their baker Lisa was able to accommodate my son's food allergies and made an awesome smash cake and cupcakes that everyone loved. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was fun. Tracy and staff were super friendly and accommodating. Great place if your a vegan or have food allergies!"}
{"text":"My go to study spot with delicious options and fast wifi .  The coffee and teas are amazing and the baked goods are flavorful !  The decor is very chill and makes it easy to relax .  The staff is very friendly , patient and observant .  After going a couple of times the barista remembered my order .  

A few favorites : lemon pound cake , vegan chunky monkey muffin, coffee cake ,  dark chocolate peanut butter latte , London fog tea, salted caramel latte."}
{"text":"THE UP-SIDE: Mojo's is wonderful, a call back to the days when coffee shops served great coffee and food, and didn't make you feel like a number. 

This place feels like home. You can hang out and work at the many tables. Never that difficult to find a spot, although they are always busy - and for good reason. The coffee drinks are perfectly created and there is a great selection of breakfast and lunch choices, along with fresh bakery. 

The service is warm and pleasant from all of the staff. They always greet you with a smile and make you feel good about coming back. Kayla has been especially helpful for any little issues I had like getting a new extension cord with multiple outlets for folks in one small area. Much appreciated!

THE DOWN-SIDE: No down side. 

THE SUM-IT-UP: I love it here. You will too."}
{"text":"Great variety of coffee and sweets.  Indoor decor is very interesting.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mojo's. It's a nice local cafe that has a great atmosphere and a good menu. The staff is friendly and fast. I normally get myself some coffee cake or a muffin which is always delicious with coffee or a latte of some sort. It is a bit expensive like Starbucks with the quality not being as good as Starbucks, but it's still very good. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars. However, the outdoor patio in the summers is perfect along with the large tables to work at with your computer or homework. I come here a lot to catch up on work and relax at the same time. I would recommend going here!"}
{"text":"This is the go to coffee shop in our area. Great coffee and espresso drinks. Sandwiches for breakfast and great cookies!"}
{"text":"Has won \"Best of the west\" multiple times. Most of the staff has been here a long time so there is a \"neighborhood\" feel to Mojos that you don't often get at the chain places. Most of the staff know exactly what the regulars like whether it is to make their coffee extra hot or maybe a tad less hot or when making a sandwich knowing exactly how the customer likes them to make it.  They also have a rewards (frequent coffee drinker) program so if you are new make sure to ask for a card."}
{"text":"Latte was mediocre. Haven't tried their coffee. Staff weren't very welcoming. The space is nice and has plenty of seating. The scones were terrible and had the consistency of dense, stale cornbread. Wanted to like this place :-("}
{"text":"Nice locally owned coffee shop I'm having a dry cappuccino it's very good. Nice selection of pastries. Outdoor patio area and comfortable indoor area... Indoor area has couch and comfy chairs and tables to do your laptops thing if you so desire... Nice to support an independent coffee shop..."}
{"text":"Best coffee shops in the area! Cozy inside and great food/beverage choices. Great for vegan/vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I'd been on the lookout for a sit-down coffee shop with a great vibe for a long time in the area and happened to stumble upon Mojo's. Plenty of natural light with comfortable sitting options here reminded me of a fabulous coffee shop at my university town where I loved to spend hours working. Giving it the highest rating because it was nostalgia inducing for me! Great place to come work and of course enjoy a cornucopia of options on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Mojo's. The space is nice and big. Plenty of tables, chairs and couches to sit around and get some work done or read a book. They have a nice little patio out front with several tables to sit at in the warmer weather. 

I have yet to have a coffee beverage here that I didn't like. Desserts are nice and there are many to choose from. They have a limited menu with some soups and sandwiches on it for a quick lunch. Stop in sometime and get a Buckeye Blitz. It's my go to drink almost every time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I'm so far very impressed. I work remotely and always looking for new spots to set up my \"office\". 

Normally, I don't jump on the pumpkin flavored bandwagon because I don't like sugary/syrupy coffee drinks with milk, etc. I was pleasantly surprised when they had a pumpkin spice flavor coffee of the day. It was perfect with just a dash of cinnamon! I also ordered a specialty croissant sandwich (sausage, roasted red peppers & provolone). This was very reasonably priced especially in comparison to how enormous it was."}
{"text":"This place is great. Usually very quiet and cozy and easy to get work done. Fairly wide selection of food for a coffee shop with several vegan options, staff is usually very friendly and quick with the exception of one or two staff members. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"I've been dogsitting for my parents for the last couple of weeks and have had the opportunity to get back to Mojos a few more times.  They've really done some awesome things here.  Now they have a homemade all vegan line of baked goods.  I tried a vegan scone and it was really good.  Also, they have a pretty extensive selection of loose leaf teas now.  I've been working my way through them and have a few favorites.  The owner/manager continues to be nice whenever I go in and they're there.  However, please please please hire some teens/young adults that actually want to be there. It's not that fun to go into a place and be treated like I'm being a bother when I enter.  Just a simple hello is fine.  Or even a half smile.  Or even a thumbs up.  Something.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just my own insecurity, but I'm really not a big fan of walking into a business and having someone look straight at me and just look away.  If it was busy I'd understand but it was only about 3 in the afternoon and only a couple other people were in the place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Atmosphere is great, coffee is great and so much bakery to choose from. I dont live that close but i never mind driving out of my way to come here"}
{"text":"Had a great chicken salad wrap from here today.  Will come back for sure for more lunches . Service was fast. Quality was good. Atmosphere was peaceful.  Can't wait to try the bulk teas."}
{"text":"Such a cute little local coffee shop located in Bay! Their drinks are amazing. Haven't tried any of the bakery but they're always making them freshly behind the counter. Im excited this little gem is walking distance from me! A cute little place to go to get studying done or just relax and enjoy a coffee."}
{"text":"Well, to be fair - I only came here once -- and not likely to come again. 

The one thing this place has going for it is the space. Plenty of light, lost of work space, and a nice vibe. 

If you're craving a well done coffee drink -- latte, mocha, cappuccino -- this is not the place for you. Maybe their brewed coffee is better? 

The most off-putting aspect is the staff. Kinda sullen. Not particularly engaging or welcoming. And definitely not invested into making a satisfying cup of coffee. Kinda beats the purpose."}
{"text":"The staff seems friendly enough and the cookie was delicious.  The coffee was OK, and the area for hanging out, working, studying is nice.  My main complaint is the terrible LOUD music.  It was so loud that I had to yell across the table to my friend and when I took a call, they asked if I was at a concert."}
{"text":"Recently visited again, last time there, the women working in the morning were fantastic! This recent visit, younger gals working, quite the opposite experience. Not very welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Cozy medium sized local coffee spot nestled in the suburbs. Huge selection of coffee specials. I'm a fan of the Cherry Cordial. Sandwiches, pastries and sweets are offered. Tables and couches to enjoy your breakfast/brunch. Small patio and ample parking, though it can be a tight fit to manuever through because the parking lot has weird traffic flow directions."}
{"text":"Maybe not the most in depth review of the food here but the atmosphere is super mellow and welcoming. 

Got the Mojo's Chaider (hot cider and chai tea) and was very pleased with it. This place is definitely worth stopping in and could definitely be a regular hangout."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to try this place! This is a really cute little coffee shop in Bay Village, perfect for meeting up with friends, reading, or getting some work done. The menu is a lot to take in when you first walk in, and is honestly a bit overwhelming because of how it's displayed, but I told the girl it was my first time and she pointed out where the coffee roasts were and explained the different ones. I opted for the medium roast and it was pretty good. But, what I was really impressed with was all of the baked goods! Lots of giant cookies, muffins, granolas, etc., and they had different ones for different dietary needs like gluten free, vegan, etc. I had the Mojo Monkey Muffin (vegan with banana and chocolate chips), and it was very good! As someone who hasn't been vegan for very long, I'm so happy about the fantastic options they have, and I'll definitely stop by on a regular basis when wanting to pick up some goodies. When my husband came with me he had a bagel with cream cheese and a Buckeye frap. He wasn't super impressed with either, but he's a little bit picky, lol. 

I will say though, that this place is a little bit loud. The music is a bit loud (although not any more than Starbucks, for example) and it's always busy with lots of young people meeting up, people having business conversations, moms getting together with other moms and their kids, etc. So, if you have a hard time concentrating when there's a lot of background noise, like myself, do not forget your headphones! But overall I really like Mojo's and would definitely recommend it over a chain coffee shop. It's just a really cute local place and I would definitely suggest checking it out if you're in the Bay area!"}
