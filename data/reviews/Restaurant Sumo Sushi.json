{"text":"Every time my family has a craving for sushi or sometimes just wontons yup, they also serve Chinese cuisine), we go to this place.  Delicious, as my kids would say.  I love that they are consistent with the quality and taste of their sushi.  The place is cozy.  The service is great."}
{"text":"Can't agree with the five stars review below saying that it's the best sushi in Montréal. Maybe you should try Park, Shinji or Juni.

Le restaurant est petit et sympathique. Les propriétaires sont accueillants. J'y suis allé à deux reprises. 

La première fois, j'avais pris des makis. Le riz peut vraiment être amélioré, mais ça reste correct. 

La deuxième fois, j'avais essayé que des sashimi pour une trentaine de dollars. c'était frais, mais le menu manque de variété. Je comprends de ne pas offrir plus de variétés, car je ne crois pas que la demande est là à Pointe-aux-Trembles.

J'y retournerai de temps en temps, car j'habite proche et le personnel est sympathique."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Montreal so far and I've been to almost all of them, from the cheapest place (sushi shop in malls) to higher end restaurants (Mikasa, Kaizen, and some that are not even there anymore with authentic Japanese sushi chefs). My younger brother is also a sushi chef and I've been eating sushi for 28 years.

We ended up going to Sumo Sushi because we just bought a house in the area, and we decided to give it a try, the restaurant is not big but very cozy, it is run by a married couple and they are very friendly.

When the sushi finally came, the plating was amazing, and when we finally took a bite it was perfect, the rice was body temperature and the fish was fresh. Just like the movie \"jiro dreams of sushi\". We have become regulars at this restaurant, eating there at least once a week and the quality is consistent. 

Their hosomakis has tuna pieces bigger than what you get as sashimi at other restaurants.

Best kept sushi secret in the east end of Montreal!!!

Update: 8/10/2016, been going to SumoSushi for 3 years now -  taste and quality have not changed since, I'm still a happy client, as for the other reviewer, Please read my first line before commenting, Best sushi \"I've had\" in Montreal. Comparing this restaurant to one that charges 35$ a roll seems unfair. 

They also serve Chinese cuisine if your dining partner is not into sushi."}
