{"text":"I never write reviews but I feel I need to let people know of our experience for the Father's Day Lunch at the Bickford Bistro. It was a disaster putting it mildly, Badly organized and managed, unprofessional, poor hospitality, an absolute mess. It was the worst event we have ever been to. I couldn't stop apologizing to my family for bringing them there, 

There was a very long line to check in, no reservations were accepted. They should have arranged for different seating times instead everyone arrived en mass.  Once we were sent to the Ballroom to find a table, we noticed all the tables were set to seat large groups so if you were a small or large group the tables were all the same. There were no empty tables to accommodate all of us together (8 people). . We mentioned it to who may have been a manager and she said there were empty seats at other tables so we could split up. Ridiculous!...it's Father's Day...why would we want to split up and sit with other families.

I thought they were having the lunch at the Bistro not a banquet hall. It was not an appropriate venue. I guess they wanted to sell as many tickets as they could so they didn't have it at the more appropriate Bistro which was what was advertised. There was an extremely long line outside in the heat for food. By the time we got there many of the trays had been emptied and we had to wait. I thought is was a barbecue...the vegetable shish kebobs were raw and placed on a hot plate, none of the food was barbecued except for the steak and sliders. The hotdogs, corn on the cob etc. seemed like they were just steamed or boiled. The lemonade at $3 per glass tasted like water. No water jugs were placed on the tables. Food ran out so quickly. Since the line was so long for the food, it was difficult to go for seconds and if you did, no guarantee there was food available. Very poor selection of dishes...where were all the salads that were listed on the menu?

The dessert was made by a man who looked like he was homeless and they had just hired him off the street...no appropriate attire, long hair in a mess. 

I felt sorry for the serving staff and waiters because they are not to blame...management is. What kind of hospitality company is this? Very amateur and unprofessional. I think the staff was embarrassed about working at this terrible event because everyone complained to them and the staff agreed with guests and did not try to make excuses . The staff knew what a failure it was and felt badly about it. I could go on and on but I want to salvage the rest of Father's Day. I will definitely not be going back and from what I heard from other guests, they won't be either. Haven't received any follow-up from email I sent management.  Beware anyone who books an event at the Guild Inn. Terrible customer service.  Dynamic Hospitality needs to sign up for some hospitality training."}

My wife and I were in the area and came across this place on Yelp.   Overall, a big disappointment.   When I walked into the restaurant, I was amazed by the beautiful room with the large windows and magnificent view.    As we sat down, the sunshine highlighted that the water glass, wine glass and cutlery were dirty.   Clearly their dishwasher was not working properly.   My wife and I ordered the soup of the day, butternut squash soup.  The soup had a strange texture and lacked flavor.   I ordered the Caprese panini and thought it was good.  My wife ordered a croque monsieur.  It was a big disappointment.   The ham was a thick slice of ham, approx 1 cm think, which was a pleasant surprise, however, the ham was cold and the Swiss cheese in the center of the sandwich was not melted.  

The service was fine.   

Overall, I was not happy with this dining experience.  They have a beautiful location, so if they get their dishwasher fixed and ensure consistent execution in their kitchen, they have the potential to succeed."}
{"text":"I have never left a review of anything before, but I felt this was necessary given the circumstances. I had made a reservation just after Christmas for dinner, had the reservation confirmed via email, and arrived at the location only to find a closed sign on the door with no additional information. I had received no information about the closer prior to leaving to make our reservation on time. 

To follow up on this I emailed the restaurant, called, then emailed again. Over 3 weeks later I received a call from the VP of sales and marketing. She explained for about 3 minutes that the staff had tried to get ahold of me via email, that I probably didn't check my spam email, that there was probably an issue on my end, and that after 2 emails and a phone call she thought it best to call me. After all of that she then apologized for the whole situation and that they would offer a $25 gift certificate or a discounted meal in compensation.

Overall, I understand that things happen that are out of human control. What we can control is how these issues are handled. After talking to this high level director, I felt as though she was making excuses to cover the business's back instead of taking responsibility for a poorly handled situation, which I would have respected and preferred. I was also made to feel that the delay in the response was my fault due to improper email surveillance. My lack of attention to my spam folder should not have been a topic of discussion for 3 minutes of a 4-minute phone call. As someone who has worked in the customer service and administration industry, I believe two things should have been done in this situation; the first being a message on the door explaining the reason for the closure instead of the plain 'CLOSED' sign and the second being a phone call to all of those who made a reservation to explain the issue and to offer a solution.  

My family has lived in Guildwood for almost 35 years and this was a big disappointment. All I hope is that management uses this as a learning experience."}
{"text":"Friendly service, food was good but a bit slow to arrive. The website is terrible and not accurate at all. Very poor management for a such a lovely room and stunning location. Only 4 tables were full which speaks to the quality of management"}
{"text":"The bottom line: do t do it! 
French onion soup was extraordinarily disappointing. The spoon fell effortlessly through the scant layer of cheese and dropped into a bowl of mostly broth. Instead of using a nice crusty bread or chunky croutons, the kitchen simply floated a slide of untoasted sandwich bread. Of course, it simply dissolved in the soup. The onions were also approaching a pure liquid state, having been boiled to death. It left me oddly thankful to find so few onions. The broth was okay. 

Croque Monsieur was, again, a very pale and disappointing version of the dish that didn't live up to the dish's name, the cafe's atmosphere nor the menu's $18 price. Again, the bread used was particularly uninspiring. Instead of broiling the sandwich to a nice toasty brown as you might expect, they just didn't. They basically took some white bread, gave it a quick egg wash, showed one side a pan for a few seconds, then stacked it with two of the world's thinnest cheese slices and one thick slice of cold ham. The sandwich came with a few of the world's greasiest potato chips."}
{"text":"Casually upscale and cozy! We had lunch at the newly rebuilt and long-awaited reopening of the Guild Inn's Bickford Bistro. Country Club dining in the heart of Guildwood! 4-Star Ciabatta sandwiches with 5-Star service--our hostess, Judy, was impeccably smart and efficient!"}
{"text":"Quaint, elegant, excellent service and great food!!!  Located in Scarborough Bluffs overlooking Lake Ontario.  Definitely a hidden gem in Scarborough.  Perfect place to enjoy a weekend lunch with family and friends.  It was a bit chilly on our visit last Sunday to walk around the Guildwood Park but if you do make a visit to the restaurant, you must take a stroll through the park.

The lunch menu has a good selection of starters and sandwiches.  We had the soup of the day to start, pumpkin soup which was very good.  My sister-in-law had the French onion soup and she said it was delicious.  My husband had the Beef Dip which I had a few bites and it was so tasty.  I was a bit regretting that I didn't get his sandwich.  I had the Caprese with Proscuitto Panini which was also very good but the Beef Dip was better.   The food almost had a perfect score but my sister-in-law wasn't too impressed with her Chicken Cordon Blue Panini.  I thought the lunch menu prices for about $16 for sandwiches were pretty reasonable considering that this is a higher end restaurant.

Overall, we had a lovely time here and would definitely come back."}
