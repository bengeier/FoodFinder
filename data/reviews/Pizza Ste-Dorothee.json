{"text":"La pizza est pas mal du tout et pas trop dispendieuse."}
{"text":"I have been to this place so many times and the standards are still the same. Not a very fancy place but the food is good. The highlight of this pizza place compared to others is tomato sauce. The same sauce is used in their pasta dishes and their pizzas and it is simply delicious. They are also very generous on the pizza toppings which is always a good thing."}
