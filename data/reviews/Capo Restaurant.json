{"text":"Came here twice more while back in Calgary over the Christmas break. Had lunch on Dec 19 and dinner on New Years Eve.  The lunch was one of the best meals I've ever had. They were trying a 3-course set menu, with a butternut squash soup as a starter, then a spaghetti bolognese and either fish or tenderloin as a main. The first two courses were great and so was the fish, but the tenderloin was basically a religious experience. We finished it off by ordering a dessert, a chocolate torte with banana-caramel ice cream and a gianduja mousse. It's the best dessert I've ever had.  The New Years Eve dinner was also amazing. We went for the early seating so there were 4 courses. Honestly, after the lunch I had these guys would've had to try to lose my 5-star rating. I'll just say that my 91 year-old grandmother tottered up to the chef's window to tell him that it was the best meal she had ever had."}
{"text":"This was my 4th time dining at Capo and I'm happy to say that each visit has been memorable.   The service was impeccable and everything flows at a very stately pace-this is definitely not the place to go if you want a fast meal!    The food was amazing-each person in our party marvelled over the creativity and complexity of the food-each course was a standout.  (One of the starters was shrimp with lemon aioli-I mentioned to the server that the aioli ought  to be illegal!)    For my money, this is definitely the best restaurant in Calgary-one that compares very favorably to the best in the Bay area of San Francisco. (where we currently live)"}
{"text":"My psyche is still smarting from an experience at Da Guido Restaurante. Save to say the food was so disappointing and the value-to-prices ratio so low I still gnash my teeth when I think about my night there. It's the reason why I don't go to many Italian restaurants. My thinking is that Italian is a pretty ubiquitous gendre, so if you are going to charge a premium it better be justified. Fortunately, Capo has me craving Italian again.  My meal was 3 courses. It started with some Carpaccio described as Cured Beef Tenderloin, Sicilian Olive Oil, Pickled Eggplants & Watercress Sprout.  The main course was a Beef Braised Boneless Short Rib with Asparagus covered in a Truffle Cr√®me Fraiche with a 3 cheese Sardinian Fregol. And the meal concluded with dessert which was the Frutta Fresca consisting of fruits with whipped Mascarpone Cheese.   I really lack the sophistication to enjoy this level of cuisine. What I remember the most is the tenderness of the braised beef. I have never had anything cooked that way in my life. What also stands out is how well the meal finished with the Frutta Fresca. So creamy, so perfect, so right.   I remember enjoying my meal thinking this might be how a caveman would feel had he been transported to the present. The senses are stimulated in ways never before experienced and he doesn't know why nor does he understand anything that is going on. But it's good ...scratch that ... great. So just shut-up and enjoy it. Capo has restored my faith in finding excellent Italian. 9/30"}

{"text":"We went to Capo for my brother's wedding dinner.  The staff was helpful and made suggestions for substitutions for guests who did not eat seafood.  The food was absolutely fantastic.  The price was high, but the experience was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"One of the greatest restaurants I have EVER eaten at. Absolutely amazing.  The Chef came over personally to chat about the food. He is extremely talented - a TRUE master of his art.  One of my all-time memorable experiences ever.  I'll be back, time and time again!"}
{"text":"New to Calgary, we did our homework on line and settled for Capo for one of our first meals out. Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates! The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch and it was great beef carpacio and maccheroni with tomato and basil, wow. Service was over the top too  I hate people who give out 5 stars but,,,,"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I would highly recommend it. My only dislike was the closeness of the the tables, you could reach out and touch the person at the next table. Make sure to plan ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"The best meal that I have ever had in Calgary. Great service too. Of course you will have to pay dearly, but again it is well worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Small intimate restaurant.  Food was so tasty.  They will refold your napkin when you come back from the washroom, and really take good care of you.  I think also dustbusted the tablecloth?  Worth going to!"}
{"text":"Even though this place is small (make sure you reserve well in advance), it's just amazing.  The Chef is fantastic, all the staff just at your beckon call, and the food is divine.  It was number 2 on Enroute Magazine's best new restaurants one year, and it really should have been number 1 (I went to number 1 that same year and it was awful).  If you're looking for a wonderful dining experience, make sure you go to Capo for that special occasion."}
