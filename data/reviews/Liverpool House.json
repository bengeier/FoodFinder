{"text":"Came here to have the lobster pasta since this is what it (and joe beef) are famous for... i have to say i loooved their pork belly dish much much more. It was in a wonderful shrimp and mussel sauce, and perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender!
Hubby loved the oysters too! 

The pasta was definitely rich, but there was a je ne sais quois missing... maybe the lobster needed salt? Some kind of spice missing? Perhaps there was so much hype around this dish that it just fell short of my high expectations! However, the portion was more than generous! I couldnt finish the pasta! Gluttonous indeed! 

The rhubarb sherbert/icecream/and meringue dessert was also spectacular!

Hard to get reservations, so get yourself the DINR app and score some last minute openings!! Its your best best!"}
{"text":"seriously one of the best meals of my life. I'm a simple gal and unfortunately not very adventurous with food.  well,  the salad and Brussel sprouts,  specifically the latter, omg!!!  unreal deliciousness. and the steak was good, more medium than medium rare, but nice and crispy and accompanied by horse radish,  tomato,  cream spinach and a delicious fig sauce of sorts. just wow. wow.  wow. treat yoself!"}
{"text":"Liverpool House is a real treat to visit. Owned by the same proprietors of Joe Beef, Liverpool House follows the same tried and true formula: a distinctly Canadian decor--canoes, moose memorabilia, and a woodsy motif with a touch of industrial, mid-century modern-a chalkboard menu, bubbly waitstaff, and freshly prepared food. I have never had anything even remotely bad to eat here and I've always left LH satisfied beyond compare.

Liverpool House has much more of an emphasis on seafood than its distinctly 'beefy' Joe Beef counterpart. In fact, the most treasured dish on the menu is the Lobster spaghetti which, while pricey ($50 for the entree), is incredibly tasty and chalked full of significantly sized lobster pieces that have been marinated in a cream-based sauce that can only be described as orgasmic. Sex for the mouth, er, sex for the taste buds is more like it! I also had--albeit a few months ago now--the best salad I have ever had in my life at Liverpool House. It was called the 'salade d'hiver,' which is why I question if it is available all year 'round. But this salad was the freshest, fluffiest, and most satisfying salad I've ever had. period. And I don't 'do' salad. Liverpool is also one of the best spots for oysters west of Le Bremner. The oysters are 'fresh to death,' quite literally, and will impress even the most demanding palate. 

Now this might just be me but I always find myself making friends with my fellow diners. The cozy environment--and the liberal pours of the waitstaff--makes for an incredibly social dining experience. Les Montrealais and tourists alike will find themselves at home amidst foodies and diners who appreciate some of the best quality foodstuffs in Montreal (and Canada, for that matter). Allez. You must, if you're from out of town as this is a truly authentic Canadian dining experience. But be forewarned, the reason this review is not five stars is because the bills at up quickly at this joint and you'll be hard-pressed to leave without a tab around $150/pp if you order an appetizer, an entree, and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday for a group dinner - 8 guys. One of the best meals we've had in a long time, especially considering the price. if anyone is heading to Montreal for any type of group trip I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Several thoughts after dining at Liverpool House because I could not get a reservation at Joe Beef:

- It was your typical Saturday evening for a popular restaurant such as this; busy crowd of people looking for a good dinner in nice setting.  I had come to the Liverpool House with my companion after not being able to get a reservation/drop in spot at the bar at Joe Beef next door.  We were recommended by the Joe Beef hostess to try Liverpool House since they do not accept reservations.  

- After walking into Liverpool House the man responsible for greeting and seating guests was kind enough to find seating for my companion and myself within 10 minutes after first questioning why we didn't have a reservation.  We were told we would need to order, eat and be out within the hour becuase the table was needed for a reservation, although, as the our time at Liverpool House dragged on it was 40 minutes before our waiter even took our order and there seemed to be multiple tables opening up all ove the restaurant.  (I still have not been able to get a straight answer from anyone working at Liverpool House whether reservations are accepted or required) 

- My companion and I ordered wine and beers by the glass.  The options are not abundant but they are unique.  There is an extensive list of wines if you choose to order it by the bottle but I would have liked to see some additional beer selections across a broader spectrum since those offered by Liverpool House were reasonably similar in taste.

- The menu is written on a chalk board, paper menus are not provided.  You are expected to make your selections from here which can cause for an awkward moment when you will be standing next to one of the tables that sit directly under them.  Do not be surprised if you receive some annoyed stares from the patrons sitting at these tables if you need to hover near them as you read the menu.

- My companion and I were seated in a position that was obstructed from viewing the menu options.  I have a reasonable grasp of French and am able to get by quite well, especially at a restaurant, but my companion did not speak the language.  Consequently, I was able to read the majority of the menu offerings but we had also asked the waiter for his recommendations after having told him which menu options we had been considering.  Instead of the menu options we picked out he suggested we order the lamb, a Liverpool House speciality, instead of ordering 2-3 plates to share between us.  The lamb was NOT listed on the menu under the \"Plates\" portion of the menu but we decided to take his recommendation as well as oder the tomato salad as an appatizer. 

-  The tomato salad was just as good as some of the best I have ever had.  The lamb was expertly prepared and the accompanying sides of steamed seasonal vegetables were equally as good.  All of the ingredients seemed fresh.  

- I will admit, the lamb was HUGE.  There was enough meat to easily feed hungry 3-4 people, far more than the serving for two it is advertised as and we were lucky to have eaten half of this.  We had wished that our waiter had accurately described just how much meat would be part of the meal becuase we would have stuck with our original plate selections.

- My less than stellar rating comes from the service provide by our waiter.  After seeing the size of our meal we had the discomforting feeling of having been upsold on the lamb and that our waiter had taken advantage of my less than perfect masterly of the French langugae and my companions complete lack of knowledge of the langugae.   When we told him this we during our meal he protested in the middle of the restaurant trying to justify his suggestion as being no different in size or cost than us having ordered two plates; one each.  

For us, the cost was not the issue, more rather tha we felt he took advantage tof the lanuage barrier to upsell us on the most expensive menu offering that was clearly too large for the two of us.  Further, the lamb was listed under the Desserts on the menu, far away from the listing of Plates where we had been looking - which had been communicated to him.  We both found his behaviour to be both awkward and rude as he continued to protest and argue while patrons from other tables began to stare, making for a more than awkward remainder of the meal until oour eventual exit from the restaurant. 

Final thoughts; the food was excellent but the service of our waiter was terrible making for a sour note on the evening and will discourage me from ever returning to Liverpool House.  I will plan to share my experience with my friends and others in the hope that they will take note and either avoid Liverpool House or be better prepared."}
{"text":"One word - OVERPRICED !!!
I have gone often to restaurants, but this is the 1st time I take my valuable time to prevent people from being ripped off.
Went there a saturday night wi a party of 4 to celebrate a birthday.
I can't say food was not good or ambiance not cool, don't get me wrong.
But when it get to a price/quality ratio, i like it to be fair for me, the customer, and the restaurant owner/chef.
For this restaurant the ratio is way off at the advantage of the owner, that is why I will never go back there.
Like one of us said went we went out, \"I feel like We have been rubbed !\"
The cheapest bootle of wine starts at $60 and it is not a big milesime..."}
{"text":"Above & beyond expectations. We are in town for our honeymoon and had a reservation at Liverpool House last night and a reservation for Joe Beef tonight. Honestly, the basis for our trip was to try these two restaurants. 
We had an excellent experience from start to finish at Liverpool House. It should be on everyone's list when coming to Montreal. 
The service was excellent - our server took time to explain the menu, as we are not French speakers, so don't be intimidated! The lobster spaghetti was unbelievable...a must-try!! 
Very much looking forward to Joe Beef tonight!"}
{"text":"As a new yorker I was a little concerned that this would be a hipster magnet with all the attitude and ennui to match (call during off hours, the vmail is hilarious), but it seems montreal raises its hipsters a little different than we do. the service is by far some of the best and most attentive i've ever known. The people aren't polite, they are authentically pleasant. 

Saimi, our waitress, looked like she stepped out of one of those D&G ads for light blue, which i assumed would mean attitude galore. But her demeanor was so freaking awesome, she eventually picked out our menu for the evening and put us onto Olive & Gourmando for brunch the next day (a super awesome choice) as well as recommendations for nuit blanche, which we were visiting for anyway.

The host, equally awesome, his name escapes me, served us drinks and was super accommodating. I wouldn't say the place is good for kids, but they didn't turn their nose up once to us having our seven year old in tow, the opposite is usually true.

The food was good. The menus are on the wall and change constantly. I gave up early and simply asked for recommendations, and every dish was enjoyed. 

Again, they serve a solid menu, offer a strong wine selection but the service was the stand out, and was simply excellent, and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"It was delicious, service was great and the wine was fantastic. Our issue was we had a 5:00 reservation and another reservation was booked at 6:30 in our seats. We were rushed out it and it was disapointing after spending a good amount of money that we couldn't have dessert to finish our meal."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal, along with Joe Beef and Maison Publique. Food is less straight forward that in Joe Beef, but equally delicious. The place is very nice inside, and every time I come here I feel like it's a special occasion. I have had bad and good service here. Drinks are good as well. I like that they cook with seasonal ingredients and they change the menu pretty often. 
Get a reservation in advance though, the place is usually packed. You can also use this app called DINR, that tells you if there are any free seats in the best restaurants in Montreal. It is pricey but totally worth it. 
If you are doubting between this place and Joe Beef, I would much more prefer Joe Beef though."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience in every way.  Arrived and were greeted and promptly seated at our reserved time.  Very busy place but the staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful in translating the menu to English for us and recommending various dished.  The restaurant was cozy and charming, fun and lively.  

We started with some east and west coast oysters, which were fantastic.  Then my wife had the lobster pasta and I had the horse steak filet.  Both were outstanding.  We weren't in a wine mood so we enjoyed the Joe Beef beer.

We would recommend this to anyone visiting Montreal and will definitely come here again next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Where to start-

We wanted to eat at Joe Beef but they were booked solid so we ate at their sister restaurant Liverpool House. We were a party of 7 and sat in the beautiful back garden area. It instantly had a \"French Laundry\" feel with aromatic herbs and beautiful tomatoes ripening on vine all around the garden. 

We each started with a mixed drink- expertly conceived and mixed by Chris the bartender. Bloody caesar, gin iced tea, bourbon sour, vodka martini- everything was delicious. 

For appetizers we loved the pate, the clam chowder, the lamb sausage, and the veal terrine. Everything that hit the table was perfect. 

The entrees were all perfectly executed and were not for the health conscious!  Horse steak cooked rare, lobster pasta (amazing), veal , chicken- each dish had a beautiful sauce and well developed flavors. 

This place is a must try- a true gem. We loved it and would go back again!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get into Joe Beef, no problem.  Liverpool house saves the day!  Lots of Joe Beef branded beer, horse tartar, oysters and lamb shank was beyond awesome.  Topped off a perfect day for me, hope it will for you, too."}
{"text":"We showed up around 11pm for a late night bite and they kindly accommodated our pop-in. We had a dozen oysters (2 different kinds, both delicious and perfectly shucked) which came with a nice cocktail sauce, red-wine vinegar shallot ordeal and horseradish. We also had the garden salad which was large and refreshing but slightly overly apple cider vinegary. We then went all out with the lobster spaghetti which was what you would expect: a whole lobster (in the shell as opposed to the same dish at partnering Joe Beef next door), spaghetti and about a pound of butter. It was good. Maybe not 55$ good. 

Service was ok, but it was late night and I felt the server was ready to go home.

The music was great and the vibe was comfortable, we had a fun time."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent and the service was wonderful, a very personal experience where they clearly aim to engage with customers.

The wine recommendations were all outstanding and the lobster spaghetti was so good I'm now craving it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Meat Lover? You have to try the Côte de Buf! How does 32 ounces of beef along with the rib and the BONE MARROW sound? Yeah, I was pretty much a fan too. Luckily I went with a few people so I was able to sample a few dishes including the lobster and spaghetti and scallops with pulled pork and they were all excellent. Combined with the blackboard for a menu, this really is a place not to be missed."}
{"text":"Lobster spaghetti is as good as it claims. However, dessert, or at least apple crumble pie is below expectation."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner during a business trip because Joe Beef was all booked. The restaurant was very cozy and had a rustic bar feel.  The dining area was a bit crammed. Tables are very close to one another and walking space was very narrow. Our waitress was extremely helpful and attentive. We started with a salad and their foie gras sandwich. It was super rich and delicious. The combination of bacon, runny egg and foie was absolutely perfect. For main course we shared the Liverpool steak and their famous lobster spaghetti. The steak was just ok, maybe it was the cut but was a bit fibrous. The lobster spaghetti was what spectacular like all other reviews attested to. The butter sauce coated every strand of pasta and piece of lobster so well it just hits the comfort spot. Could not eat any dessert after the great meal and would definitely be back next time in town."}
{"text":"Liverpool House serves some terrific food.  Definitely the best fois gras I've had in Montreal.  Beware though, it is a large size for 2 people, probably best for 4 as it is so rich and heavy.   Wine list was terrific.  I have the rabbit korma which seemed a bit off the wall for a restaurant like Liverpool, but it was quite delicious.  I've had my fair share of Indian food and I thought it had some very intense and authentic Indian flavors.  And the rabbit was extremely well prepared and tender.  I haven't been to Joe Beef yet, but this was really really good.

I docked a start for two reasons.  The first is really minor, and not really a complaint at all, but the menu was in French and had to be translated by our server.  I don't mind because I'm a visitor in their town and restaurant, but it was very busy and the server didn't really have the time to properly translate.  This limited my confidence in ordering a few dishes that I just wasn't sure about from her brief description.  The second issue was unfortunate as the seating is cramped and we were sat next to a really, really drunk and really loud group of people.  Our server was apologetic, but it ruined the experience to some degree.  Perhaps not their fault, but I'm reviewing my experience.  

Would certainly go back, although we'll probably try Joe Beef next time for a different experience.  Liverpool is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Was seated at the bar. Bartender told me check out menu on a chalk board at the other side of the place w/ dim lighting. What service! He recommended the hanger steak and joe beef beer. Beer was good. Parts of the steak was really tough. No problem with the price. Some reviews mentioned condescending staff. Maybe, but not important to me. Am all about food. Not coming back, bringing my money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Went last night for my birthday. We were a group of 3, and unfortunately, the restaurant decided that we deserved to be squeezed in to a table for 2 by putting an extra chair at the table. We had to move the table to wedge into our seats, and then realized that one of us was sitting directly over a cold vent. Who wants cold air blowing up their crotch for an entire meal? Not us. so we asked to move. We were moved to the table right next to the front door, where we sat on the most uncomfortable bench for the next 2 hours. No cushions, nothing to lean against, just a terrible place to sit for 2 hours.
Which is unfortunate, since the meal was so delicious! Had the shrimp and polenta and eggplant and mozzarella to start. They were both great! The shrimp came with a lobster gravy that was amazing, could have had it to drink. 
For our mains we shared the onglet and the lobster spaghetti. Both were great, especially the lobster. We ordered the bread to soak up the extra sauce, which was the best part of the entire meal. 
For dessert we had the black forest cake (not so good) and the almond cake (pretty good).
Overall, the meal was great, but it was disappointing to be seated so poorly. When making a reservation next time I would specify where I wanted to sit. I would suggest the same for anyone reading this."}
{"text":"My family and I reserved months in advance to prepare for our trip to Montreal. Though we were initially shocked by the high prices, we were absolutely blown away by the food. We started off with foie gras, and were pleasantly surprised by how nice and smooth it was. Not the usual fatty foie gras you would expect. We had a basic salad as well. For our entree, we split up the Lobster Spaghetti ($50+) and Chicken ($45). The pasta was definitely worth the price, but we were surprised by the price of the chicken. After seeing that we may need a little more food, we added the brussel sprouts. Boy was that a good idea! Those were the highlight of the night!  We finished with two desserts, and our total bill was over $200. If you don't mind paying the big bucks, I HIGHLY recommend it!"}
{"text":"The server really knew his menu, but unfortunately didn't seem to know his wine list.  
The food was top notch. Flavours were decadent.  
Quail entree was amazing and the horse was so tender."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is amazing!  The service was incredible and the food out of this world!  The whole meal was suggested by our waiter and it was delicious!  I had Chavel in other words horse!!!  Delicious!!!  If you go to Montreal you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Our meal at Liverpool House was excellent and the best way to start our trip to Montreal. We began with oysters and a pasta special (with foie), then had the lobster spaghetti and steak with bearnaise and asparagus. The oysters were fresh and briny, and the pasta appetizer was delicious.

For the mains, the lobster spaghetti was amazing - rich and creamy with al dente pasta and large chunks of lobster. The steak was seasoned well and had a nice sear. The dining room is cozy (but laid back) and we made conversation with the couple next to us. Overall, the service was good and the meal excellent. We will definitely come back when in Montreal."}
{"text":"I almost felt obliged to write about this place. 

I'm usually very hesitant about giving out a 5-star review to a dining place, just like how i see a box office hit with a healthy take of incredulity. After all it should be very personal experience isn't it? 

Like some of the other reviewers below, I was bumped from Joe Beef for not having booked in advance, and was made aware of its sister restaurant right next door. My french isn't that good to understand the menu on the blackboard so i studied it by taking a photo and ended up picking the trout with cauliflower souffle. And I was impressed. I mean, when you saw a whole deboned trout presented in its most complete and original shape, you know they are serious about food. I'm not sure how often they change the menu though, and I'm not even saying I made a good choice of food here, because I seriously think you wouldn't go wrong with any selection. In my definition of quality dining, I'm supposed to feel happy when seeing my plate, and can still remain happy throughout the entire course (a side note, I was eating alone at the bar, which made the whole happiness even more invaluable).

To give you an idea of the price, a glass of wine, several oysters plus the main course would easily put you in the $60's range. Not the most pricey meal i've had, but certainly worth every dollar spent. 

The neighborhood is a bit lackluster to an out-of-towner, but don't be discouraged. The restaurant is made for you."}
{"text":"Possibly the best meal I have ever had!  And great service.  Would come back to Montreal just to eat here again.

The foie gras torchon appetizer may be the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  And yes, the lobster spaghetti more than lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to come to dinner at Liverpool House for quite a while and neither of us were disappointed at all with our first experience. 

The service was excellent, the menu had wonderful options and the food was absolutely delicious.

I ordered the lobster spaghetti as it is so highly talked about, and it was fabulous. My husband ordered the rabbit which was also phenomenal. 

To pair with our food, our waitress also recommended a delicious rosé which paired perfectly. 

The seating is tight, but it allows for open conversation with other guests which my husband and I both enjoyed very much.

Overall, our experience was fantastic and we'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner. Ordered the house salad to start. Was delicious. My eagle eyed wife spotted a fruit fly dead on a carrot. Fruit flies were buzzing around. Understand they're hard to control. 

Wife ordered the lobster spaghetti. She started eating it for twenty seconds and spotted a short black hair on the spilt lobster tail. Told the waitress and she removed it stating she will make another one. 

I completed my fish. Was very good. Except my wife watched me eat. I knew what was next. About 10 minutes later they brought her new lobster pasta. Now I had to watch her eat.  She felt bad but she loved it. 

Nobody including the server apologized for the hair. Normally a manager is notified and stood by the table to apologize. Waited forever for the check. Our waitress was handling a large table and never checked in on us. I asked another sever for our check. Finally our waitress brought it. 

Not the way we expected our dinner to go. 
One star for service, the fruit fly and hair. 
Still tipped 20% as always. Not sure why but the servers always expect it for whatever type of service they give. 

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"This spot is a true treat. Although kind of pricey, it's truly worth every penny. Competent staff, food is always amazing and unique dishes. Amazing experience everytime. Reserve now, books up quickly!"}
{"text":"I loved our meal of Pintade (Guinea Fowl) and Foie Gras.  I thought it was $40 for 2, but the 0 turned out to be an 8, and it was actually $48 per person...oops.  It was totally worth it.  It came with pasta and salad with gizzards--sounds horrid but was delicious and elegant.  (The meat, if you want to call it that, tasted like Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, but I didn't tell the waitress that).  The oysters before that were very good, too, with fresh horseradish, homemade ketchup, pesto, Worcestershire sauce and lemon for toppings.  They were fine naked, too.  Oh, the foie gras was to die for.  And the Pintade was tasty, with a perfectly golden crispy skin.  Nice, plump and juicy mushrooms.  Our alluring waitress with the Ruby Woo lipstick (hi Samia!) brought us a very nice cognac to go with our dessert.  I don't remember the name, but it wasn't an old man's cognac.  Once we found out the Chocolate and S'mores Pot de Creme was made with house-made marshmellows, we had to have a go at it, and even though I'm too old for marshmallows, I had to admit it was delectable.  Service was efficient, friendly, thoughtful and well-timed.  We did not feel rushed even though we were there for 4 hours.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  It gets loud--around 9:30 pm you go from shouting to talking in gestures to speak to the person directly in front of you, but that's fine--the ambiance is great for sharing food with friends.  Dinner was $238 + tip, for 2, and was definitely the best one I had in a restaurant since Au Pied de Cochon a few years ago.  Servings are generous--bring your appetite and good friends!  We came as 2 tired and worn out women with nothing to celebrate, and came out sated, elated and grateful for a great evening.  Thank you, Liverpool House, for a memorable night!"}
{"text":"We had one of the best meals we have ever had at Liverpool House. We made he reservation on the DINR app the day of and snagged a 9pm reservation. The ambience and service was simply wonderful, along with sharing the lobster spaghetti and strip steak. This place will never be forgotten and we can't wait to come back when we return to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about Liverpool House and a lot of disappointments. I guess people have high expectations those days. I enjoyed my night there, even though the vibe (a bit trendy right?) and the food isn't my style. If you like english/pub style food, you will love their cuisine as it's done perfectly. My friend and I shared several entrées and I tried the horse steak. The meat was excellent, but it lacks creativity - I like to eat what I cannot cook myself -. Price wise, I think it's a bit overpriced and it's riding the trend from Joe Beef. I would recommend it to my Anglophone friends who prefer quantity over quality... 
I really hate standing up to check the menus..."}
{"text":"Very good tasty generous portions of food and a huge variety of tasty best quality ingredients but Iam talking about the place when they have such a good reputation they cannot jam people in one room no space to move , too bad because the food is excellent !"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. After two weeks of foodie frenzy in Montreal,  I am certain this is the best all around restaurant in the city. Perfect service, incredible food, cool yet unaffected vibe. A must for anyone who is serious about food."}
{"text":"I ordered a fish dish that was too buttery for me, but the rest of the food was good. We had great scallops and oysters. It's a fun atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. J'ai commandé les spaghettis au homard, c'était délicieux, goutu et les portions généreuses. Evidemment le prix n'est pas donné, mais j'en ai eu pour ce que j'ai payé. La terrasse est vraiment sympa, on se croirait au bord de la mer... Même si la mer n'est pas près"}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Joe Beef.  We were seated outside in the back section of the garden with a lovely view of the sky. The menu is written on a chalkboard as it changes daily.  We had the shrimp polenta as the appetizer...delicious!  For entrees we shared the hanger steak, spaghetti with lobster and duck.  We ordered one of each of the desserts and they were great.  Everything was amazing!  It was one of the best dining experiences ever."}
{"text":"First of all, they were incredibly polite and accommodating. We called early in the evening and while they said they were completely booked, they told us to come down and they'd squeeze us in, which they did, three minutes after we walked in the door.

The service was excellent,. Jean-Phillipe was very polite, attentive, and he made us feel immediately at home from the second he stepped to our table. We explained that we couldn't read the menu, which was entirely in french, so he did us the favor of describing some of the appetizers for us. He'd periodically check in on us throughout the evening, usually to gauge our reactions to the food, which were a mix of ravings and silence, due to being completely at a loss for words.

The food was incredible. Not even joking, it was the best meal I can remember having... ever. We started with the brussel sprouts which blew my mind. I'd never had them quite like this. I believe they fried them in beef fat, and dressed them with a cider/honey/hotsauce concoction that was absolutely perfect. Oh and the mussels. Not too briny, fresh and delicious.
Horse filet. I never ever thought in a million years I'd eat horse, but I did, and it was amazing. Very similar to beef, but slightly more tender, and just as, if not more delicious.
The lobster pasta plate was huge and the pasta perfectly cooked. Creamy sauce with so much lobster. The two of us barely dented it, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.
We finished the meal off with the sticky toffee pudding. I'm a big dessert eater, and my date isn't, but she raced me to the last bite.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience and after I got up from the table, I wanted to walk into the kitchen and open mouth kiss the chef so he could taste everything I just did.

Thank you Jean-Phillipe and everyone at the Liverpool House, next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to come by."}
{"text":"This place was bomb. Came here for dinner with 9 friends during my bachelorette weekend. We did the chef's tasting which was incredible. Seafood tower was super fresh and delicious (nice briny oysters and sweet crab, scallops with fennel and dill), the foie gras and homemade bread and the onion bread and cappacuolo were fantastic. Mains were hanger steak, chicken, and a branzino and all were all phenomenal. My favorite was the seafood tower and a brussels sprout they made for my vegetarian friend---SO FREAKING GOOD I'D GO BACK JUST FOR THAT. Seriously, the flight from NYC to Montreal is so short and the exchange rate so favorable, it is a no brainer! This was one of my favorite meals in recent memory. I'm almost mad it was so good, because the bar is really high now....oh well. Worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good serves and great Poaple.
Liverpool steak my favourite. I love this place and the vibe of the Poaple.."}
{"text":"This is my first tasty lobster spaghetti, tasty is good. But Liverpool steak is so so."}
{"text":"We've been planning our visit to Montreal for some time and this was a reservation we made well in advance. It was certainly worth the wait. The service was great and the food better. We had a shellfish appetizer and would highly recommend the razor clams. The oysters and shrimp were fresh and very flavorful as well. We had the lobster and spaghetti and flank steak entrees. Both were large portions and we definitely could have shared one. However, that would have meant not experiencing both wonderful dishes!  Street parking was easy to find."}
{"text":"Too rich for my blood.

The ambience and atmosphere of the Liverpool house is phenomenal, however on a hot Montreal day the meat is not the only thing making you sweat. For a place that is charging upwards of $40-50 a plate I would hope they can get some AC, but again, this may be a normal thing in Montreal so I am putting it out there as a disclaimer and not holding it against them.

We had three dishes in total, the pressed lamb flank, the lobster spaghetti and a special of the day which was pojarski (veal stuffed with liver I believe). The appetizer was the lamb flank and I happily rate it a 5/5. It was a fantastically flavor piece of lamb, a good amount of fat, but not chewy. I shared the lobster spaghetti and pojarski with my girlfriend and oh my were both extremely rich! The lobster I unfortunately have to give a 3/5 rating. It was good and better then a few other similar dishes I have had, however at $55 a pop and being the number one hyped dish, I guess I just expected a bigger wow factor. Having said that, first bite four stars, by the end of the dish three. Finally the pojarski, I ordered this with having absolutely no idea what it was and ended up asking the server after I got the dish. It was very good and extremely rich. If you are into liver and extremely rich, powerfully flavorful food, this is the dish for you. Sadly it was a little too rich for my taste so I have to give it a 4/5.

Since I think we may have ordered two of the richest and filling menu items (other then the one pound steak they offer) we sadly had no room for dessert.

I may still have given Liverpool House a five star rating, but in the end of the day I ask myself, 'would I come back here?' And the answer is no, the food is great, but the prices are too high for not having the most amazing experience.

I am very happy I came to try it once though. If you can't get into Joe Beef, I would recommend you try the Liverpool house!"}
{"text":"I love how most of the restaurants in Montreal have such a lively atmosphere. You just know everyone is having a great time and enjoying themselves-Liverpool House was no exception. I was surprised they have a nice little patio behind the restaurant. It would be great in the summer. The server was great at explaining all of the dishes in English even though he was busy. At Liverpool house, go big or go home.

We tried the breakfast foie gras, grilled clams, Brussels sprouts and horse tartare for appetizers. The stand outs were the brussel sprouts and breakfast foie gras. The brussel sprouts were deep fried and doused in a spicy honey sauce. Addicting. The breakfast foie gras was pretty much a meal in itself and everything melded so well together. I would return just for that dish. The grilled clams were a tad fishy. The horse tartare wasn't too bad. I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised at how lean and tender it tasted. I expected the texture to be more tough. I would've preferred more seasoning and smaller pieces. 

Our mains consisted of the lobster spaghetti, rainbow trout, duck and steak. The lobster spaghetti was massive-buttery and rich. The steak was decent but not out of this world. The duck was solid although I'm not sold on the pairing with olives. The trout cooked perfectly and tasted great with the butter sauce. They served mashed potatoes with peas for the table which tasted great with the butter sauce from the trout. Stand alone it was fine but unnecessary since the portions were huge. 

Solid restaurant but I did feel slightly disappointed. Mainly because my expectations were too high given all of the good reviews and ratings. We made reservations a month in advance for June."}
{"text":"Liverpool House provided one of the best meals of my life.  I came to Montreal for my bachelor party and we were lucky to get a reservation at Liverpool House for seven on a Saturday night.  Awesome table on the back patio, and we could not ask for a more perfect setting.  The waiter was awesome, and provided great service.  He pretty much ordered everything for us, and everything he brought out was amazing.  I liked everything I tasted but their beef dishes and their lobster spaghetti were out of this world.  Thank you Liverpool house for being a highlight of our weekend in Montreal. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for dinner 3 weeks before arrival. This review is not on the food which I was eagerly anticipating, but on their service. We arrived in Montreal only to discover that they were closed for vacation. No one called us to let us know, which was very disappointing. Apparently they don't care enough about their customers."}
{"text":"Other than the crowded seating and the menu that is difficult to see from most seats (take a picture and read it on your phone!), the restaurant and the service was excellent. The food was wonderful.

Now, we only have to solve the problem of which one is better, Joe Beef or Liverpool House. I guess we will just have to go back repeatedly to help decide."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm!!! It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it! The drinks are good, and the food is done well. I think what I liked most about this place was the great atmosphere, the restaurant isn't too big, it's cozy and warm. The only downside, all our food was a tad on the salty side and I was craving water at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Special occasion place for me due to high prices. Joe Beef is better"}
{"text":"The food was great!

We had some oysters, which were fresh. As entree, I had the deep fried pepper stuffed with lobster and surrounded by corn. While a little spicier than I expected, it was very flavourful and the pepper was slightly juicy. My partner had the burritina (a mozzarella-like cheese) with caramelized onion and olives, which was also very tasty.

For mains, we had the quail and the horse burger.  The quail was nicely cooked and seasoned. I wasn't a fan of the mushrooms, but the potatoes were nice. The horse burger came with potato and mushrooms, but (both) lacked in any real vegetables.

A warning, you get a _lot_ of food. The main especially was so big that we couldn't finish them. The quail dish actually came with two quails.

The services was good. I appreciated the patience of our waiter to go through the food menu with us. Sometimes our waiter was a little hard to flag down, but we did have people check up on us on occasion.
 
The short version: delicious, and we would give this a 5 except that it's rather expensive (especially the drinks)."}
{"text":"Liverpool House and Joe Beef have been on my list for quite some time. Two years ago I had reservations at Joe Beef that I could t end up making, so I vowed that on this trip north nothing would stop me. So that's how my partner and I ended up at Liverpool House on a Tuesday night. 

We had reservations at 6. Initially we were one of two parties but that didn't last long, the tiny space quickly became packed. Luckily, we had a good opportunity to check out the menu before people were sitting in front of it. 

Partner speaks no French and mine is rusty at best. Our delightful waitress was more than happy to explain everything and answer any questions.  She was also very patient with our ordering style, \"I'll take another drink, whatever you recommend\"

We started with drinks-beer for him and a bloody Caesar for me. Drinks kept flowing through the night. I recommended the caesar as well as the Moscow mule. 

We split a winter salad to start. Assorted greens with grilled veggies, shaved park, and apple cider vinegar. 

Partner had the Liverpool steak and I had the lobster spaghetti. Both were fabulous. 

Finally, we ended with a sticky toffee pudding dessert. I would have kicked the plate if it was more socially acceptable. 

The entire experience from ambiance to good to service was utterly delightful. I've marked it off the bucket list, but would gladly visit again!"}
{"text":"Good, not great. We could only get a reservation at the bar, where we had a great time chatting with the bartender/server and learning about Montreal (and other eateries and bars). The atmosphere was excellent, but the food left something to be desired.

There is no paper menu here - apparently, Montreal is really big on chalkboard menus that you must walk to in order to see what's available. No matter, we ordered three appetizers: brussel sprouts, rabbit nuggets, and mussels.  The brussel sprouts were good - very well cooked and seasoned, albeit a bit salty. The rabbit nuggets and the mussels left something to be desired: the mussels were VERY bready (maybe 3:1 ratio breadcrumbs to actual edible mussel), and the rabbit nuggets, while good, were mainly big cooked globs of bechamel sauce with a little rabbit inside.

For dinner, we got the chicken and the hangar steak. The chicken was well seasoned, but difficult to eat. It had a gamey, homey feel - pleasant and comforting, but nothing special. The steak was very rare, and also very salty. Nothing remarkable.

To finish, we had an apple bread pudding dessert. It was very good. The cocktails we had were also excellent.

Overall, I would give the restaurant 3.5 stars - 3 stars for the food, and an extra half-star for the great staff, cocktails (the 'hard lemonade' - it's served in a mason jar - is the bomb). Don't be too bummed if you miss it during your visit to Montreal, there are so many delicious places to eat."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience start to finish.

We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.

Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.

The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.

For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.

Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.

Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations. 

Expect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed"}
{"text":"High end food + rustic chic décor + blackboard menu + small room + dim lighting = a successful formula. Many of Montreal's most successful and trendy restaurants follow this precise code - think Garde Manger, Joe Beef, Bremner, Club Chasse et Pêche, L'Orignal and yes, Liverpool House.

Don't get me wrong - I love the formula. Just because something becomes popular doesn't mean it should be dissed. I'm not that kind of person. I love Britney Spears.

Liverpool House was one of the few restaurants that began this trend in Montreal. Clearly, it did so successfully. One of the best things about these \"rustic chic\" places is that they re quite casual but still focused on the haute, and that they welcome a certain \"older\" crowd. You know wont be annoyed by loud 19-year olds fête-ing their unfortunate halter-top wearing friend's birthday because of the slightly higher price point. Liverpool House, thank you for existing.

There's something undeniably charming about walking into a small space where RSVP's are difficult to come by, being welcomed as if you were entering a friend's Hamptons' home, and sitting down at an unpretentious wooden table set with a plaid serviette. The blackboards and framed pictures adorning the walls just add to the atmosphere, and the soft lighting makes the good-looking people this place attract even better looking. Really? Yeeeah, really.

I loved everything that contributed to my experience at Liverpool House. Our waiter was supernice and supercute, knew the (new!) menu well, and timed the services perfectly. My friend and I split the braised lamb cavatelli ($11) to start. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the lamb was soft and very flavourful.

Next, we had the infamous lobster spaghetti with bacon and tomato sauce ($49) and the scallops with braised pork belly, lentils and fried egg ($34). Both were insane. The spaghetti had huge chunks of lobster (way more than you would think) and a slightly smoky flavour from the bacon. It was a huge portion, enough for two actually.

The scallops were some of the best I've ever had. Overcooked scallops are an obvious faux-pas, but I also really dislike undercooked scallops. In my opinion, they should be raw (tartar, ceviche) or cooked (pan seared, grilled) - none of that awkward middle ground that results in a warm but raw mess on your plate. Liverpool House's scallops were incredibly tender and cooked to the perfect point - not the least bit chewy. The pork belly was as delicious as ever, and the egg and spiced lentil puree brought everything together beautifully. Sounds weird, but it was flawless.

We decided to finish our meal with the House's parfait ($11). Real crème fouettée, caramelized apples and white sponge cake in a jar, topped with caramelized pecans. Sounds unspectacular, but each part of the dessert had a finesse to it. It really was delicious. My dessert fiend friend was floored. (Tongue twister, anyone?)

And finally, let me address one last thing that I've heard mentioned too many times. Many say Liverpool House is pretentious and has a too-cool-for-school attitude, but I really don't think so. I think that those who call it pretentious are the ones who weren't prepared for the restaurant's price point (even though it's totally justified by the quality of its dishes) or those who tend to feel self-conscious in trendy places. Yes, this place is \"hot\", but everything about it lives up to the hype. So relax and take pleasure in its unaffected vibe. Don't overthink things. Just go and enjoy... It's a foodie must.

{"text":"This restaurant rocks on so many levels!  Highly recommend!

I dined this evening with a large group as part of a corporate event. I eat a plant based diet -- and was so touched by the chef's willingness and ability to craft AMAZING dishes without advanced notice. They served an heirloom and basil salad with the freshest tomatoes. Followed by a mushroom and bean pesto pasta that my carnivore enjoyed as well.  And lastly -- a light and fresh fruit salad was served for dessert. My colleagues raved about the chicken dish and the lobster pasta as well."}
{"text":"Excellent !! Le petit frère du Joe Beef 

Le décor est simple, pas trop chargé et accueillant. C'est très petit alors il faut réserver d'avance. De plus, le secteur semble créer une effervescence Le service est très professionnel et agréable. 

Le menu, sur ardoise, change souvent. Des entrées, plats principaux et desserts articulés autour du thème de la mer, saveur française, locales ou autres plus spéciales. Tous les accompagnements sont de saisons et plusieurs fines herbes sont prises directement dans le jardin a l'arrière.

Nous avons pris 2 entrées : saumon fumé maison avec asperges blanches (voir photos) et des crevettes a la russe avec du caviar noir.. Très bon ! Ensuite, j'ai pris les pétoncles grillées, excellente cuisson. Mon homme a pris le fameux spaghetti au homard , décadent !

La seule chose qui nous a accrochée est vraiment le prix. Oui c'est bon, oui c'est fin. Mais on a pas le même thrill qu'on a eu a mangé au Joe Beef... C'est plate un peu, on avait vraiment hâte d'y manger. Pourtant, ça nous a vraiment coûté la peau des fesses. J'imagine qu'il fallait s'y attendre mais pour ce qu'on a eu dans nos assiettes, meh."}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to the hype! I made reservations way in advance, although, I don't think it is as tricky to get into as Joe Beef. I wasn't sure what to think when we first arrived- it is super cramped and looks like it is a restaurant in an antiques shop. However, every single course was actually perfect. 

We started with a seafood platter of PEI oysters, local sea urchin, and scallops. The oysters were simple, clean, with a briney aftertaste. The scallops were marinated in a veggie confit. That doesn't really make it sound amazing... but it was. It was really reminiscent of a Portuguese take on scallops. Lastly were the local sea urchin. This is one of the greatest dishes I had in all of Montreal. The sea urchins were so clean with a silky texture and the creme fraiche and chives  is a fun Gastropub play. We order two more right after finishing them bc they were so incredible. 

Next we had venison/deer tartar on a large tater tot. The texture balance was perfect, the deer was clean, and the dish overall was insanely good!

Lastly, we shared the lobster spaghetti and a side dish of roasted delicata squash (have to get in some veggies!). The lobster spaghetti was everything everyone has mentioned- creamy, perfectly cooked lobster, heavy, delicious. Def get this iconic dish, but I recommend sharing it bc of its richness. The delicata squash was also amazing. Topped with evoo, a sunflower seed/herb sauce, and creme fraiche- I'm so happy we added this side dish.

They have a full bar and my negroni was perfect (sweet in the front and bitter in the back). The service was kind and knowledgeable. Lastly the wine list was massive and a range of prices (loved our Pinot noir from the Burgundy region). Overall, jus adored this place! Def worth the expense and reservation."}
{"text":"Really great food, wine and incredible service. I went with my boyfriend and in-laws and my mother in-law has very particular dietary restrictions. She often encounters a lot of resistance from staff, but the waiter and chefs at Liverpool House were so understanding and accommodating, I was truly impressed. Our waiter was patient, knowledgable and not once made us feel like we were being annoying. The chef even prepared a really cute little dessert that my mother in-law could eat. They made the whole experience so comfortable and pleasant. Really great dining experience, from start to finish."}
{"text":"From the owner of Joe Beef, a restaurant where those not-so-adventurous foodies can eat. Liverpool House has a rotating menu, so many reviews have mentioned specific dishes that were nowhere on the menu. However, I will mention what was on the menu yesterday when I snagged an awesome last-minute table. There is one main dining room and the bar area- totally decked out in Canadiana- deer antlers and row boat oars. Great artwook on the walls. We sat in front of the dinner menu and throughout people had to come stand near us to take a look at the options du jour.  This could be a great way to meet some new friends!
Service was great in french and english explaining all the wacky dishes and preparations. They also aren`t bad for the eyes...
Entrees range from $9-20 and run the gamut from Huitres (oysters) to steak taco. I tried the gnocci, as I try to do at any place that serves this dish.  It was creamy and soft- obviously made within the day.  
Plats (main dishes) run from $25-50 for the lobster spaghetti, which I saw and it has pretty much a whole lobster on top!  Most are in the $30 range. Of the fish options, artic char or doré, I opted for the char with a `crust`of shrimp. Awe-inspiring and tasty. This had to be the biggest peice of char I have ever seen, and the smallest plate at my table.  The pintade (guinea fowl) was served on a platter and was the size of half a chicken. The rabbit could have served two, but my SO managed to finish it off!  No room for dessert, which is maybe why they only have 3 options. No matter, they all looked good. 
The drink selection is great which wine by the glass and a whole other wall-sized chalk board to review the wines by the bottle.  
At the end of the meal, I stepped to the other side of the table to the hallway labeled, `pipi room`. After a bloody ceasar (served with oyster on top) and one glass of wine left me giggling all the way home."}
{"text":"Great spot. As hard to get into as Joe Beef after Justin & Obama enjoyed a meal here. I've been several times. Great atmosphere & friendly servers. I always have fun here! My husband adores their lobster spaghetti. I don't have a favourite meal here- but have never left disappointed. Everything is pretty yummy. My only gripe is their washroom: It smells like piss - come on!!! That's not a scent that opens the appetite....wish they'd deal with that & I'd give this place 5*!"}
{"text":"Liverpool House is the sister restaurant to Joe Beef, and all-in-all isn't much different. The ingredients seemed to have a more Italian influence, but the fresh chalk-board format written in French and the overall feel were the same. You can see my Joe Beef review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/joe-beef-montr%C3%A9al-2#hrid:n59hUnVH_DjwObH0Upo4Zg, my boyfriend and I went to Joe Beef the night before Liverpool house.

We came into Liverpool House with a strategy, ordering much lighter appetizers than the previous night: clams casino and tripe. My boyfriend had never had tripe before, and I had bad memories of a chewy substance in tomato sauce, but this was not the case at Liverpool House. The tripe was melt-in-your mouth good, and the sauce was so flavorful. A definite favorite and all the couples around us ordered it after seeing ours come out of the kitchen!

For dinner we thought we were being savvy ordering the lamb for two, in light of the overwhelming portions at Joe Beef the night before. Boy, were we wrong. What emerged from the kitchen could have easily fed a family of four. The meat was tender and perfect, and it came with a large dish of seasonal veggies. We finished the meal with some sweet sorbet, and ran off to some nearby bars to wash it all down.

Pro tip: try the Joe Beef Pilsner, very crisp and refreshing, and only available at Joe Beef, Liverpool House and a couple of other local spots."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food is great, but some dishes might be a little heavy (ie. lobster spaghetti). For starters, we tried the oyster mushrooms with goat cheese - amazing! Must try.

Our server was extremely nice.

Get some dinner here and continue drinks across the street at Little Burgundy. Carpe diem! Ad fundum!"}
{"text":"Liverpool house is a sister restaurant for Joe beef. We couldn't get reservations to Joe so we decided to eat here. It has the same lobster pasta so we gave it a try. I liked the pasta it was filled with creaminess that is not overpowering or cheesy. Just the right amount. Big pieces of lobsters made it very appetizing. The portion of pasta is huge. I ate all the lobster and then took the rest home. 

My friend got the duck but she didn't like the duck breast portion where it felt too raw. I liked it a lot!! 

We also had mushrooms and zucchini to share. Nicely grilled with so much flavor. Also shared the spreadable foi gras. It came with this buttery fat that I didn't really like but just wipe it off and it's all good. 

Overall good but drinks are expensive! A glass of house wine is $16/gas."}
{"text":"Wonderfull spot, with a full menu (on chalkboard) of fresh dishes perfectly prepared. A great spot to enjoy dinner with your loved one or a couple friends over a good bottle of wine (great wine list albeit a bit pricey).
Watch out for crowds even during the week as this place is always packed.
Well done!
Bon appetit."}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful atmosphere. Fun place with greatest lobster spaghetti I've ever had. You need tongs and crackers the whole lobster they drop in the bisque drenched pasta. 
Good wine selection too! One word: GO!"}
{"text":"We tried making reservations but we're unable to, however there is an option to \"waitlist\" for a spot. We lucked out and scored a reservation. As others have noted, the specials are on the board while you receive the set print menu. Ambience was great - fantastic vibe with awesome music and service. Very \"East Village\" for me. My favorite!  We decided to order a bunch of things and just share. We ordered two specials - duck meatballs and the lamb tagliatelle. Both were incredible and had wonderful heat. We also ordered the tartar cause you kind of have to. It was really good and canceled out any guilt I had from ordering. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts which was one of the best flavor profiles I have had and I love my sprouts!  Lastly we tried the famous Montreal breakfast sandwich with foie gras, farm egg and local maple syrup. Just wow. Oh I forgot, we also had the chocolate pudding. All this with a few glasses of wine and beer and our bill (with tip) was about $125 American. Crazy. I would come back here anytime and would recommend it to everyone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the cerf with bearnaise sauce. It's was simply amazing.... absolutely perfect! For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding, which could easily be shared by two people. Again, simply perfect!! Already looking forward to my next dinner at the Liverpool House."}
{"text":"We were lazy and didn't book a reservation at Joe Beef on a Saturday night ahead of our first visit to Montreal, so we tried walking in when the restaurant opened at 6pm. But there weren't any tables until 9:30, so they sent us down the street to try our luck at Liverpool House. Lucky for us, we were sat at the bar as it was just my boyfriend and I. Luckier for us, we were seated right in front of the oysters and Canada's friendliest servers. For two people on vacation, we loved sitting at the bar as it was really the easiest way for us to chat with some locals. We talked about the city and mostly about the Habs being better than the Canucks. (My Vancouver-ite boyfriend had to agree, esp. this year.)

Anyway -- the food! We got a dozen oysters, half from Nova Scotia and gigantic monsters from Maryland. Really delicious. We also got the foie gras parfait which was heavenly and rich. Being corny tourists, we had to try some horse since it's not on many NYC menues. We had it raw, ceviche style, and it was really tender and summery tasting. Not sure ceviche is what we were looking for in March, but the flavors were good. We were recommended a nice dry white to go with the oysters, then switched to red with our appetizers.

The really nice thing was the head server sent us over a free appetizer of roasted shishito peppers, saying we should have something crunchy while we chatted. Then the other server gave me a free refill of wine with an \"I insist.\" It was so thoughtful.

The only thing I didn't like was the menu on the blackboard in the other room. I would've preferred not awkwardly standing over a table squinting and trying to translate French. Our servers were great to ask about it, though. I'd REALLY hate to be the people sitting under the blackboard. Bar all the way! We had a great experience and look forward to returning on our next trip."}
{"text":"This is the hardest review I've written, because there are so many factors playing into the experience at Liverpool House. I'll start with the food, which was good. I began with fried zucchini flowers that were stuffed with paneer and peas. They were coated in a garbanzo bean batter and fried to golden perfection. The flavors, including the accompanying sauce, were delicate and delicious - a nice kick of toasted coriander seed among them. My partner started with the short ribs in curry, and they were also very good - tender and flavorful. For mains, I had the salmon with lentils, recommended by our server, and my partner had the dorade stuffed with shrimp and served with clams. These were both flavorful, and my salmon had a surprising and nice crust, but it was extremely salty. Same of the dorade, though the clams were delicious.

So far, so good. The ambience is relaxed as well and very welcoming. I felt a little sorry for the party that was seated below the menu board since they were among the first in the place and had to suffer through every other diner hovering over their table to decide what to order (they don't provide menus at table - fine, and hey, kudos for saving trees when the menu changes daily - but odd for those at table beneath it).

The staff is great. They echo the atmosphere of the place, very easygoing, yet attentive and helpful. One server gave us a couple other recommendations for spots in Montreal, which was really kind.

The price was quite steep. My salmon with lentils was over $30. It was a warm day and we decided to have a bottle of white wine, and there was nothing on offer below $40...and the price rose to $75 pretty steeply from there. Which seems incongruous with the vibe of the place and many of the dishes on offer.

The menu overall felt a little disjointed, with some items influenced by this spot's chef, who is from Pakistan, and other items like foie gras with brioche that are more traditionally associated with the Joe Beef guys, who also run Liverpool House. I get the British-Pakistani influence, but somehow it all seemed a little more experimental than cohesive.

Lastly, and probably a key to the whole experience - Liverpool House is next door to Joe Beef, which is where we originally hoped to get a reservation, but which is booked a month out, we learned. And we were guided to Liverpool House, as are no doubt many others. But they have little in common besides ownership and maybe vibe. So it feels a bit like the poor cousin there to scoop up those who don't plan far enough ahead. Why they didn't just expand Joe Beef instead, I'm not sure - maybe it's about food sourcing or some other capacity issue. In general, it's easy to want to cheer for these guys. But I would say, if you want to go to Joe Beef and can't get in, there are better substitutes at a better price in Montreal than Liverpool House."}
{"text":"Yum yum!  Great vibe and great food.  I struggled a bit with the menu with my non-existent french but our waitress was very helpful with all the choices. We tried an assortment of their recommended plates and everything was tasty.  Must make reservations well in advance since this is a popular spot.  Brussel sprouts and lobster spaghetti were my favorites."}
{"text":"Yes, my girlfriend and I came here because we couldn't get reservations at Joe Beef about 2 months out. But we were not upset, because we knew we would be in for a treat here.

The restaurant is cozy (to put it nicely) so be ready to know your dining mates. We were seated promptly and the restaurant writes specials on a blackboard towards the back corner. Slightly hard to read for some people, and our waitress didn't come to explain the specials to us either. Anyway... 

For appetizers, she ordered a scallop dish and I ordered the shrimp salad. For our mains, she got the famous lobster spaghetti and I got the rabbit legs with foie gras. The scallop was interesting, as they sat inside an opened can with some sauce. It was delicious. The shrimp salad was very tasty as well, and a perfect start to the meal. 

The lobster spaghetti was fantastic, rich, creamy, perfectly al dente pasta with chunks of lobster. But out of the two mains, the rabbit leg was definitely the highlight. Moist, flavourful rabbit legs with a giant chunk of foie gras sitting on top of some sauteed spinach. I don't think I've had a dish taste *that* good in a while. 

After mains, we ordered a tea and a dessert (which was a donut of some sort, with pistachio cream and other things). 

I also found the price to be reasonable. Coming from Ottawa, a similar meal would have been over $200. For what we got, I think it was an incredible meal at a great price. I may ignore Joe Beef and just keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I had a heavenly experience at Joe Beef a few months prior to coming to Liverpool House. I wanted to take my friends visiting from out of town to Joe Beef, but we couldn't manage a reservation, so I figured Liverpool House would do.

We got the horse tartar as an appetizer, and for mains, the scallops, rabbit and duck dishes (I don't remember their full names). I wanted to order the horse steak but they didn't have it that day. I had loved the horse tartar at Joe Beef, and I loved it too at Liverpool House. The scallops and duck were good, but the rabbit was a little meh. All three dishes had a good amount of delicious (but very heavy) sauce. No one brought us bread voluntarily but I asked for it and got it. Bread is a great vehicle for sauce. 

While the food was good (though not spectacular), my experience was tainted by the service and atmosphere. And despite waitstaff constantly walking around the restaurant, they weren't particularly attentive and it was hard to get service most of the time. But what was the most annoying was the volume. We were seated at the table closest to the kitchen, which is also next to the bar. First, the kitchen is loud. Second, one of the staff at the bar was drying or polishing a seemingly never ending supply of cutlery in a way that produced a lot of noise, of cutlery hitting each other. I can deal with loud chatter, but the sharp clanking of cutlery was really, really unpleasant and lasted for about 30-40 minutes.

Maybe I had unrealistic expectations for this place by thinking it would match Joe Beef even in service, maybe things would have been better if I had been seated elsewhere. But I left disappointed, and with a hole in my wallet."}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Friendly waiters. Young, hip atmosphere. Had a salad to start   (Great), bloody Cesar (tasty), the rib steak as main. Beautifully cooked and well seasoned. The twice baked potatoes were very tasty as well. All in all an excellent meal. The menu, being on the black board, is a bit of a pain as the restaurant is dimly light. 

Those that have menus should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I wanted to David Carradine with the lobster spaghetti."}
{"text":"Once you decided that you are going to Montreal, do yourself a favor and book a reservation online ASAP. Reservations goes by extremely quickly. I made my reservation by the skin on my teeth. There were only a handful of availability...And I made my reservation a month in advance! A thing like that!
If you love food then The Liverpool House is your Shakespeare and the dishes are sonnets love sonnets designed to swoon you out of your pants (or at least unbutton it due to the gluttonous effect it will have to your waist). 
It's a bustling atmosphere with intimate spacing. The aesthetics is cool with effortless charm and character. We were early for our reservation but was seated promptly. The menu is written on a chalkboard on the wall but unlike our time at Joe Beef they gave us paper menus. I take away a star because we asked for some food to be wrapped so we can take it to the hotel with us but we never received it and we felt rushed to leave our table.
 
We started with a lovely Horse Tartare topped with a small salad and raw egg. I have absolutely no qualms about eating horse (a romanticized pretty version of a cow), and it was one of the better tartare I have. 
Hubby had the half rabbit with fiddle head fern and rabbit roulade. Tender and delicious.
The highlight of the night (and of our Montreal/Quebec City trip) was the Foie Gras Breakfast Sandwich with a sunny-side up egg, bacon, and maple syrup. Oh My Gras! Each indulgent bite was rich and heavenly. I highly recommend this dish.

The food is a bit pricey but not to extravagant; for 1 appetizer, 2 entree, and 2 beers the bill was 129.70 CAD/ 99.20 USD. I say that is a steal for the well crafted decadence they present.

Note
-They are open from Tuesdays to Saturdays from 5pm to closing
-A short walk from station Lionel Groulx and around the area of the Atwater Market"}
{"text":"Best meal EVER!

Made reservations two days before -
We are super laid back so happily offered to take a ten pm time at the bar (we prefer bar).  When we arrived they said we could have a table if we wanted, so definitely later at night there's lots of walk in room. 

We had two chalkboard specials and two menu items - torched foie gras (5/5), lamb tartare with no cilantro (5/5), asparagus (4/5) and lobster spaghetti (5/5).  We each had two glasses of wine recommended by the server, and I appreciated although he selected them they were $13/glass, very reasonable. We still chose to sit at the bar and had a great time.  The food was the right amount, which the server had also helped us with by letting us know when I asked at initial ordering that we need not order more.
Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"My very loving partner decided to surprise me with a birthday dinner here. We had always talked about coming here after visiting Joe Beef a while ago. And as with Joe Beef, reservations are hard to come by, and the only ones available are usually after 9pm. Which we didn't mind one bit. Similar feel but slightly larger than its sister restaurant. The music this night was a lot of classic 90s hip hop, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Ordered a couple oysters, a squash flower special with pesto dip (amazing!), fois gras with cranberry jam and dinner rolls (first time trying the fois!), the rabbit leg special (kind of dry and underwhelming), and the lobster spaghetti (had to). With the exception of the rabbit, the food was amazing. Well executed, and delicious. Also had a corn ice cream eclair for dessert, which was over the top at that point, but worth it. Our server was great, recommending some wines to go with our meal, and taking care of us overall. Can't wait to come by again!"}
{"text":"Made a quick dinner reservation at this restaurant and it wa beyond our expectation! The space is quite small and intimate and good for a smaller group. We ordered the hanger steak, lobster spaghetti and rainbow trout and every dish was cooked to perfection. Service was great and the i will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food is good, really good BUT the true magic here is the people who work here.  I came 2 hours late on a busy Saturday night forgetting the real time of my rsvp.  I would have assumed he could not do anything but he made arrangements for me.  I tried to tip him but he refused and said his tip would be if i had a good time, all by the way genuine.  My waitress who is completely comfortable in her own skin was nothing short of amazing.  
(Sorry i dont remember your names but you both are amazing.)"}
{"text":"Seriously, I think Liverpool house is worth than before , about service and food , overall . The waitress is rude , ( with not serving plats and a poker face ,showing her attitude while when we tasting the wine ,  typically looks like 'Chinese ppl will not tip you, Chinese ppl doesn't have money to drink a bottle wine ' ) , well , I declare I tip every time and always 15 or plus in general , but I really don't want to tip her after her service ( even though I still tipped , after a 400 plus bill I think 10% is away enough for her ) anyway , no reason to eat at a such expensive resto for a low level of feeling ."}
{"text":"Liverpool House lives up to the billing, unlike the football club in the English Premier League. A group of friends and I came to Montreal for a bachelor party but our group was too big for Joe Beef. Liverpool House, its sister restaurant was able to accommodate our party with a family style dinner.

The menu is chef's choice which comes with an array of appetizers, mains, side dishes, and desserts. My favorites were the Horse + Bacon tartare, Lobster spaghetti, ribeye + foie, and lemon meringue + crumbs. We all felt like we gained 5 pounds after this monstrous meal, in which we probably tried everything on the menu. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"Good scallop sashimi and oysters.

Lobster spaghetti is good, but super rich.  Only place I know that uses heavy cream for spaghetti dishes.

Horse steak was good and tender as well.  As expected, not as flavorful as steak from cattle.

Good service."}
{"text":"What a great evening and a beautiful start to out Montreal adventure. We had reservation for 6 and arrived promptly, we were escorted to our table and got a brief explanation of what to expect. Our waitress arrived shortly and observed our crooked faces looking at a chalkboard with the daily menu written in French. After getting our wine and beers she explained each starter in elegant detail and took the time to clarify when needed. We order a few items family style, her recommendation, and enjoyed each one. My younger brother took the lead on ordering BC he is the foodie in the family and knows best. We had oysters that were almost sweet, foi gras ( I think) which was surprisingly delicious and we each had a bite and we had the beer cheese bread. All starters had good portions and tasted wonderful. I ordered the trout ( served in all it's glory) and even though m wife want a tail and head kinda gal she even tasted it. It was cooked perfectly and served with capers, peas and a delicious sauce. My brother ordered a sirloin and it was the biggest chunk of happiness I have seen in a good while, it was served with broccoli and some type of cheese. Besides him ordering it med well it was delicious! His wife and mine shared the lobster pasta and it was enough for each. Served with an entire lobster on top they were super nice about splitting it up. Our waitress took the time to explain th 20 something menu items in such great detail, answered all our tourist questions and even suggested a few other places to stop. I would love to return but there are so many great places to try in this town. Thank you Liverpool house, ps can you get us into joe beef before Saturday?"}
{"text":"GREAT food in a low-key place. Well-flavored, well cooked.  Nice staff."}
{"text":"I'm so excited we got to dine at the Liverpool House. It really was a great experience and probably the highlight of our trip to Montreal. The food is just fantastic. I went with the most popular (and expensive!!!) dish, lobster spaghetti and have zero regrets! Seriously we've paid less to feed our family of four dining out than we did on that one dish, but man we were on vacation so who cares, right? It was so worth it. I'm already trying to figure out how to recreate that meal at home! My partner got the rabbit, also very delicious!! Highly recommended. He was so happy. The waitstaff and service is wonderful. They walked us through the menu, checked in constantly, refilled our water before they were empty, even brushed crumbs away in between courses. We had a few beers each and enjoyed the 90's hip hop. Totally our kind of place. Would and WILL go back every time we visit."}
{"text":"Joe Beef and Liverpool House are universally acclaimed as some of the best restaurants in Montreal. As a foodie - I scrambled to make reservations here once I had booked my ticket to Montreal and luckily scored one for 9pm. The menu is primarily written on the walls, but is somewhat difficult to read with the dim lighting. I wish I knew what fish dish I ordered (but my French is not all that great), and it was good, but nothing spectacular. Personally, I think it was a little overhyped. Maybe next time I would order some of their all-star dishes like lobster spaghetti, instead of opting for their less-pricey (about $30 dollar) fish dish. The customer service was great, and the waitress spent a great deal of time with chatting up her tables."}
{"text":"Well after hear some mixed reviews I decided to try the restaurant myself. I've never felt more neglected my life. I had to ask several times for water and bread. I ordered the supposedly famous lobster spaghetti. I was told it would be 1 and a half pound lobster. all I can say is maybe once it was a pound and a half but not when I got to my plate. and for 49 dollars is well. stay away from this restaurant. it's a rip off .There's so many other great restaurants around montreal."}
{"text":"One word. Phenomenal. Homemade cavatelli were amazing. Dessert was heaven. Incredible eating experience!"}
{"text":"Location: Southwest, on Notre-Dame. Metered parking is available but if you don't mind a short walk, you can park for free in the surrounding area. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's probably 10-minutes from there (unless you're a fast walker). 

The place: While it IS a small and compressed space, this really didn't bother me. I like the cottage feel of the place as well as the decor (minus the big-a$$ deer head). We were seated in a corner right by the window (below the big-a$$ deer head) so we didn't feel claustrophobic or like our space was being invaded. 

The food: Let me start with what my friends ordered - the rabbit and the roast chicken. According to my friends, both dishes were amazing. The only comment was surrounding the chicken, which was a little dry in some sections but it wasn't a big deal. Other than that, the dishes were a hit. On my end, I went with the infamous lobster spaghetti. I know that I'm going to go against the grain here, but I wasn't really impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly - I like mine super al dente and that's what I got. In terms of the lobster, I have zero complaints about the portion - it was quite generous and the claws were meaty. That said, I found it to be somewhat lacking in flavor. I'm not a lobster expert so perhaps lobster is generally lacking in flavor? I dunno. As far as the broth goes, this was also lacking in flavor. Based on the reviews, I expected the dish to wow the sh*t out of me and it didn't. It was good but not fabulous.

Where I did have the sh*t wowed out of me was dessert. We ordered the pot au chocolate, the Paris Brest and something else whose name I don't recall. Each dessert was decadent and bloody incredible. These guys are not cheap with their portions either - that goes for everything that they serve. 

Service: We were warmly received by the staff, and our waitress was super friendly. She took the time to explain the menu, make suggestions. Our water glasses were always full and our table was cleared quickly once we were done eating. The only thing that bugged me is that the busboy kept sticking his arms in my face while my friends and I were talking and he seemed oblivious to what he was doing. 

Price point: Steep. The spaghetti is $55. L-H is definitely a place you go to if you want to splurge."}
{"text":"Creative food in a relaxed setting.  Lots of great wines available by the glass and bottle.  The deep fried Brussel sprouts are a must!  Lobster pasta was excellent.  Portions are generous and the food is very rich, no room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Reservation recommended! 
The table was very closed together- but fear not, it encouraged the diners to talk to each other. It was our first meal of our trip in Montreal, and we got some very good recommendations from locals as well as frequent Montreal travelers. Everyone here is a lover of food and there's nothing better to wine and dine while connecting with strangers on food. 

Atmosphere aside, the food is a knockout.
Foie gras breakfast sandwich: if you like sweet and savory you will love this one, good to share 3-4 people. 
Lobster spaghetti : creamy lobster spaghetti, can't go wrong, it was delicious as it is satisfying. 
 
Could do without the eclair, but you didn't come for dessert anyway. 

Shout out to our server who drapes a towel over the cold A/C vent."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they have taken the much raved about lobster spaghetti off the menu. Got the halibut instead, which I found to be over cooked and dry. For $38 I expected a more impressive dish. The scallops were also over cooked and chewy. 

Out of all the courses, I was most impressed with dessert. The sticky toffee pudding and mocha pot de crème were amazing. 

Will stick to Vin Papillion in the future."}
{"text":"Whoosh! Our first dining experience in Montreal and how glorious it was. Thankfully, a friend of mine was able to get us a late reservation on the Thursday we arrived. We were shown to our table, a teensy affair jammed next to the people behind us. 

It's dark, sexy, intimate... but they were playing Biggie, Timberlake and all these 90s hits. Love the juxtaposition. We ordered a glass of wine, a beer, half a dozen oysters and the pancetta to start. Those oysters? Best I've ever had, hands down. They were the Southlake kind and when you add some of their magic mignonette, a perfect bite. 

Our dinner was comprised of a giant sirloin and lobster spaghetti, two things which our server indicated were always on the menu. The lobster spaghetti was creamy, buttery awesomeness topped with in-shell lobster. I still don't know what they did to that steak but it was red all the way through with a char that can only come from some serious kitchen equipment. 

Here's what's good to know about this spot: 
-- The small tables/area is pretty typical of Montreal restaurants (we were quick to learn) but it's really packed in there. If I wanted to move, either the person behind me had to or I had to basically shift my chair 90 degrees every time.
-- The menu is written on the chalkboard wall. Yes, this is cool in theory - especially since the menu changes a lot -- but in practice makes it quite difficult to order. Either you're hovering over someone trying to read the menu on the wall or craning your neck from the table. 

Neither of those are deal breakers but it's something to be apprised of before you go in. Our service was excellent, the place is spendy but not outrageously so for what you get and I'm just sorry we didn't have room for the foie gras."}
{"text":"I think if I lived in Montreal, or at least closer, I would make a reservation for this place every few months. 

Joe Beef and the Liverpool House were names I kept hearing over and over every time I mentioned an upcoming Montreal trip to someone. So, even after the reservation was made I had to wonder what the experience would be like. Would they, already having established themselves as this landmark Montreal eatery, be pompous and impatient? Sneer at my lack of knowledge of French wines? Well, I'm laying it on a little thick, but the answer was absolutely not. Some of this surely had to do with our excellent waitress. Her name escapes me, but young, dark hair, clearly knew the place from the inside out. She made us feel like we belonged there from the moment we sat down, asking what sort of drink mood we were in, which led to me having one of the most amazing beers I have ever had (per her strong suggestion), a saison from Brasserie Morin, which she noted was owned by a brother to one of the owners of Liverpool House. She picked out a cocktail for my girlfriend by taking note of her mood and tastes as well and conferencing with the bartender, which turned into a Paper Plane that she raved about. 

I would like to believe everyone's experience is like this, but the gentleman who sat the table next to us pointed them to the chalkboard of specials and advised them to go take photos of it to reference before ordering. I won't lie and say it wasn't kind of comical to watch people stand in the middle of the dining room taking photos of a chalkboard that they surely could barely see once they got back to their table, but it was a little funny. Probably a little off-putting to some though. Thankfully our waitress also swept in and told them that staring into their phone photos wasn't necessary as she explained everything on the board in full. 

All of our food was delicious, some beef cheeks, a braised veal shank and a salad, but the rabbit terrine... wow. Worth the trip alone. I'll have that and that Morin saison in my dreams for a while. 

The ambiance was cozy, homey, and felt like you were amongst friends. The seating is somewhat close to each other, but that probably leads to some great inter-table conversations once the drinks get flowing. Then again, the table to one side of us was occupied by some just horrible, rude people so I guess it goes both ways... such is life in public settings. 

We made reservations at least a month in advance and the Liverpool House did not disappoint. If we thought we could have gotten in a second time the week we were in town, we surely would have tried it. However, the more I reflect back on our dinner and I tell friends \"they made us feel so at home\", \"they weren't snooty at all\", I realize I'm actually talking about our waitress who stole the show. Bravo all around."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal and possibly one of the more under-appreciated if considering quality of food and nice atmosphere. This is what I've grown to refer to as a \"Chalkboard Bistro\". The menu is provided on a single large chalkboard hung on the wall, written in chalk. While I'm not a big fan of this practice, the menu at Liverpool House offers an excellent range or options (not limiting but also not overwhelming) making decisions a bit difficult and leading to a repeat visit! Everything I've had here has been very good to excellent but the Lobster Spaghetti was AMAZING...one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten. Atmosphere is casual / comfortable, the staff very friendly, knowledgable and helpful."}
{"text":"C'est là que Justin Trudeau à emmener Obama diner après sa première venue à Montréal, pour un discours devant la chambre de commerce de la ville. Trudeau fréquente ce restaurant depuis l'époque où il travaillait au journal le Globe."}
{"text":"Just had a birthday dinner date at this restaurant. The service, food and atmosphere were so good that it made the night very special. I'm so glad this is where we went for the birthday.

I hadn't been to Montreal in many years and my date had never been to Canada at all, neither of us spoke French and since it was our first night there we were a little apprehensive about navigating the city and the language. 

We sat at the bar and were attended to by James- a true professional. The staff at Liverpool were friendly and welcoming and put us at ease.

We had the gravlax appetizer, which was the best I've ever had! Also some of the best Nova Scotian oysters ever. We also shared lobster spaghetti and a halibut plate. Everything was luxurious and sprinkled with caviar. Mmmmmmm...

They were gracious about omitting ham from a dish since I don't eat that. 

There was Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon playing on the bar TV. A nice touch as well.

Thanks, Liverpool!"}
{"text":"We had good experience in this place, but nothing special.  Maybe because we had really high expectation given the Joe Beef affiliation and Bourdain Hype.

We had the lobster spaghetti, which is good, but not the best lobster preparation we had.  Horse tartare was a unique experience, coming from US.  The rabbit dish that night, leg and sausage was really good and was the highlight of our meal."}
{"text":"Originally I was quite disappointed when we could not obtain reservations for Joe Beef.  The wait is over several weeks, so I thought I was set telling for the restaurant next door, was I ever wrong.

I was completely floored by the experience at Liverpool House, it was outstanding.  The raw bar was the very best I have ever experienced, giving me an opportunity to enjoy Sea Urchin for the very first time, and it was amazing.

The menu is varied and eclectic with Old French favorites like Confit to some of the best seafood and steaks in Montreal.  Our waiter put together a special tasting just for us and it was sublime.  He also paired our wines from one of the most extensive lists I have ever seen.

This spot is truly a gem in Montreal, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We choose this spot for our nice dinner out on our recent trip.  I was so pleased when we realized our day was stacking up to be very busy, and on their confirmation call they were able to move our reservation to the following evening.

We took a cab from the hotel....and spent some time stopped in commute traffic.  Maybe we should have made a later reservation.

This part of Montreal reminds me of Berkeley's gourmet *ghetto*....this is a small restaurant in an old storefront.

Service was wonderful, and we were seated immediately.

Menu was on a chalkboard....and had a nice balance of dishes. we choose a nice bottle of white wine, which was a bit dear in my estimation.

GF ordered and shared the Brussel Sprouts...which also had a kick.  Absolutely delicious!

I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti.  Mixed bag...pasta was perfectly done, sauce was mind blowing, actual lobster was tough and stringy. Again, too dear for the quality.

Others dishes included Gnocchi (sauce was very good), chicken, and fish....all good, but perhaps not great

We shard a luscious rich sour cream cake with fruit and cream.....love!

A bit expensive for the quality, great sauces and dessert.....seems to sum it up for us."}
{"text":"Our take-away from our experience at Liverpool House was that it was a destination. It is owned by the same people as neighboring Joe Beef and shares some of the drinks and renowned Lobster Spaghetti on the menu. Once you visit Liverpool House you can cross it off of your bucket list.

It's strange. For such an expensive restaurant with delicious food and drinks, the interior borders on dingy. There's kitchy nostalgic pieces including a stuffed bird perched on top of a vintage soda cooler. The menus are written on blackboards on the wall. The are written exclusively in French. The poor server had to translate and recite the entire menu to us. Apparently she's used to it. We heard her do it three or four times while we were there.

Speaking of which, there were many English-speaking tourists at Liverpool House. One table was a group of four boisterous locals who seemed just as comfortable as the casually dressed employees. I suppose it was hard for us to wrap our heads around paying $$$$ for dinner while dressed in ripped jeans.

The portions of food were tremendous. Each of the three dishes we got could easily have been split between the two of us as a satisfying entree. We could have saved money and only gotten two of the three items we ordered.

The brussel sprouts were our favorite. They were perfectly cooked. Only slightly charred on the outside - enough to make them crispy - but soft and succulent on the inside. They were fresh and verdant when bitten. The seasoning and sauce were perfect accompaniments to the sprouts making harmony to their song.

I got the lobster spaghetti. Apparently it's the same recipe as Joe Beef. The lobster easily slipped out of the shells in perfectly cooked whole pieces of goodness. The lobster portion was truly generous. It was so generous that I didn't mind sharing with M. Normally I would jealously guard all of the lobster for myself and only give out nibbles when begged. The sauce with the spaghetti was rich and buttery. It was a really rich and creamy and amazing dish.

M got the horse. She'd never tried horse before and thought, \"Why not?\" It was served as a huge, lean filet mignon and wrapped in bacon. The server explained that horse is such a lean meat that it must be served nearly rare and with bacon because it doesn't have a lot of fat to stand the fires of much cooking. She was right! M liked it, but it's not her favorite meat. She agreed that this was probably the best way for her to try horse; however, it sure was expensive.

Neither one of us was able to finish our entire meals. Early on, I had to prioritize eating the lobster and skip the pasta. M favored my dish over hers and gave up most of her entree and helped me eat my lobster. We agreed that we should have only ordered one entree and shared it."}
{"text":"Being a long weekend I called last minute at 6PM for two hoping for a cancellation.  They said if we came right away we could have spots at the bar, but need to finish by 8PM. The food, service and ambience was all amazing.  Chris was very knowledgeable about wine, recommended a nice bottle of Spanish red.  The menu is extensive and on the chalk board including their daily specials.  We started the meal with their asparagus and poached egg, and the shrimp salad, followed by the lobster pasta, which was much like Lobster Americana, and an order of beef brisket served with new potatoes and broccoli. We left after 9PM after two bottles of wine...The food is tasty, very rich and good sized portions.  I learned from Chris that you if are alone there's a good chance you can get a seat at the bar, since there are odd number of seats."}
{"text":"I went to this place with 3 buddies. We weren't very original because we all ordered the same thing: oysters with horseradish, beat salad and lobster spaghetti. Everything was very flavorful and the lobster spaghetti was outstanding - possibly the best I've ever had! The chalkboard menu was a tad difficult to read from our vantage point, but our server happily listed all the dishes for us.

The service and atmosphere were great but the place is small and very popular so make sure you reserve in advance."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the steak for 2 is simply delicious and big enough for two persons
They also have a nice list of wine to accord with your meals
The service is very friendly and dedicated 
I can go back anytime!!!"}
{"text":"seemingly effortless combination of upscale food with a british pub atmosphere. my first visit to liverpool house was a solo affair where i sat at the bar and made quick friends with fellow diners and the staff. i was offered good advice on wine and was made expert cocktails as well."}
{"text":"Reservations are a must here. We had an early reservation time and the place was fairly empty. I had the lobster spaghetti. It was very good and tasty. The service was great and everyone was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The menu was on a chalkboard and I had a hard time reading it so they were able to explain to us what was on the menu. The venue was dark and intimate with a cozy feel to it. I would come back here to have that lobster spaghetti again. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fairly abysmal. I had looked forward to dining at this restaurant but the quality of the food is so far below it's reputation that the absurd prices, far from confirming the excellence of the meal, just appear to the disappointed diner as exorbitant. The Duck Terrine was tasteless, overcooked and as if wrapped in dried out salt pork. The razor clams were rubbery and the diner was only able to taste vinegar and onion. The veal liver was nicely-cooked, tender and flavorful but, in the end, just liver. The Walleye was poorly cooked, crispy on the outside but without any texture or flavor on the inside. The service was decent, but that isn't hard to do when the customers are jammed together, practically sitting in each other's laps. The wines are good and pricey. Overall, if you are interested in quality food, avoid this place."}
{"text":"cool ambiance, nice wait staff.  spaghetti w/ lobster is a winner."}
{"text":"If you are planning a trip to Montreal, make a reservation for Liverpool House the minute you book your flight. I requested a reservation 2 months in advanced and was waitlisted until a few days before when I was offered early seating... take whatever you can get!! It's so worth it. 

My boyfriend and I totally over ordered but have no regrets. All of the food was amazing and worth the food baby that hung around for 12+ hours. Between the two of us, we shared oysters, razor clams, beef tartare, Joe Beef Fries and the Lamb Porchetta. All of the seafood  and beef tartare was fresh and prepared perfectly and the Joe Beef Fries had an extra crisp exterior and tasty dipping sauce. The Lamb Porchetta was one of specials for the night and it was by far one of the best things we ate on our trip - MUST ORDER. If you like porchetta, you will LOVE this dish. The portion is perfect for sharing between two, especially if you want to maximize the number of items you can try. 

Highly recommend."}

{"text":"Un.Be.LIEVABLE.
We had a reservation at 7 and they sat us promptly by the window so we could people watch. The vibe is casual yet somehow upscale. The décor reminds me of my mother's kitchen, comfortable with a touch of French attitude. The menu is fantastic and I wish we could have ordered everything. We did not feel like making our way multiple times to the chalk board which shows the menu. Our waiter was more than happy to give us appetizer and oyster suggestions and we went from there. The fried oyster appetizer was unmatchable. Three fried oysters assembled on top of a giant oyster shell had special sauce and lemons on top. The artichoke app was equally as impressive. I wish I knew the names of these dishes, but I was about 5 drinks in at this time. Of course my mom and I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti- after looking at everyone's pictures, you kind of have to. A Huge price tag comes along with this dish, however, the amount of lobster you are consuming is enough to feed the entire city of Montreal. I loved every bite of this dish and got more and more upset when my plate was becoming emptier and emptier (or I might have just gotten emotional from all of the wine).

The wine selection is never ending and the white that our waiter picked out for us was a perfect dry chardonnay. What was even better was that the couple next to us didn't finish their wine (that is unacceptable) and gave it to us. Their red was one of the best red's I have had.

I wish I could dine here every single night- yes. It was that good. And no, I'm not just saying that because I was intoxicated off of wine and good food all night."}
{"text":"We came in just for a weekend trip and had a reservation for Friday night at 9:30. We walked from the Vieux Port area. It was a bit of a hike, on the long side, but doable. Even though we arrived a half hour early, we got seated right away. Thank God. Because the place was packed with barely even any room to even stand in the doorway and flag a staffer to check in. 

Like the other reviewers note, the menu is on a chalkboard on a wall. I was ready for that. I wasn't ready for the items to be in French. LawdhelpmeastereotypicalAmerican. Thankfully I could gather enough food words to know what most of the items were (like moules, poulet, spaghetti, and steak) but there were definitely a few where I just had no freaking clue. Also it felt awkward to be hovering over someone's table to stare at the chalkboard... and it was dark. I tried to take a picture but it wasn't coming out clear.

So we sat at a table that was basically elbow to elbow with the tables next to us. Literally to get up and go to the bathroom, you have to push a table to the side otherwise your butt will end up in someone's drink/plate.

Our server was more than happy to explain some of the menu items but also noted that things mostly change constantly so recommendations were pretty loosygoosy. The lobster spaghetti and steak are always on the menu -- but why order the things that are always on the menu when you can be more adventurous with whatever came in and inspired that day? Plus pasta is such a safe option, and safe = boring. 

So we got mussels as an appetizer . There were four mussels stuffed with ham, breading and other unidentifiable deliciousness on top of a bed of chunky salt. Really tasty.

Then we ordered a whole arctic char stuffed with an array of mushrooms and spinach and accompanied by a luscious creamy sauce with dots of black caviar, with a side of steamed broccoli. It wasn't particularly pretty to look at, but my the flavors.... so delicious. The fish was cooked beautifully and the mushrooms and sauce all went together unexpectedly well. 

For dessert, we split the Paris Brest with chocolate and hazelnuts and pastry cream. It was alright. The choux pastry was denser and chewier than I expected, but you can't really go completely wrong with smothering pastry cream, chocolate and hazelnuts on anything. 

So overall, a fine fine meal and great experience."}

{"text":"I cannot begin to describe this place. It's located next door to Joe Beef, and has much of the same decor styles and ambiance. 

The breakfast foie gras was hands down the best dish I have EVER eaten. It was like the first time I was given food. Plated on organic maple syrup, the entire creation  of breakfast perfection has ruined me. It's all I can think about. It has single handedly set the bar so high that I cannot imagine any other restaurant or food item coming close. The yolkey envelopment over the  creamy foie gras in combination of the fresh and local bagel was also just sublime. 

We also had the lobster spaghetti which was also incredible. I will be back, that I can assure you."}
{"text":"We had an incredible group dinner here. We had eight people, so we had to do a set menu that was almost certainly more expensive than it would have been had we ordered a la carte, but they definitely don't shortchange you -- we got a really intense amount of food.

The menu included:

- Lamb tartare
- Foie gras breakfast sandwich
- Mozzarella with bites of eggplant parm
- Salad
- Lobster spaghetti
- Fish
- Chicken
- Steak
- Broccoli
- Desserts

My personal favorites were the tartare, spaghetti, and steak, but the group's overall favorite was the foie gras sandwich. (I'm not a foie gras guy, but they were raving about it for days afterwards.) Everything was really great though, and I'd love to come back here or to Joe Beef at some point to do the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience here. Originally, I thought I had made a reservation at Joe Beef next door, but I was not disappointed as Liverpool House carried some of the same dishes on their menu. I was promptly seated and service was great.
I decided not to go for the well-known & loved lobster spaghetti because I was dining solo and not hungry enough. Instead, I started with the soft crab, clams, mussels & crisp vegetables with garlic aioli from the specials menu. The vegetables were extremely fresh & the soft crab was perfect. I followed this with foie gras & blueberries. This was my first taste of foie gras, and it was delicious.
I'm grateful to have had this dining experience in Montreal & would most definitely do it again."}
{"text":"What to say?  

I was too busy at work to plan my Montreal dining adventures and therefore I was unable to secure a last-minute reservation at the highly recommended Joe Beef. Fortunately for us I was able to secure a late-night reservation at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.

We were among one of the last tables of the evening, the service was casual yet impeccable.  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about both the food and wine choices.  Our sever patiently explained each menu item (menu = in french on a chalkboard) to our 6-top table of tied conference-drunk women with ADHD.  When some of us ordered Oysters on the half shell our waitress graciously brought extra (as one of the amuse items) so that everyone at the table might try some. 

For an appetizer we consumed a foie gras sandwich nestled between a freshly baked  \"English Muffin\"  topped with house-cured bacon and local Artisan cheese then drizzled in local Canadian Maple Syrup.   Perhaps one of the best things we've ever eaten (unanimous on this nomination among this group of dining ladies).  Later, in celebration of our foie gras \"high\" the staff let us dance on an adjacent table as celebration  (note, they joined in the festivities).

I pretty much wanted to come here on every remaining night in Montreal or at least try to squeeze a seat for dinner at the bar at Joe Beef.   I will probably brave Montreal in the winter months an have a culinary vacation based on this dinner.  

Eat here, just do it, it's awesome !!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Me and my fiancé came here for dinner and were seated in the garden/patio at a picnic table. We ended up talking to the couple next to us and sharing a few bites of items which was interesting. It's hard not to when sitting so close to someone. 

We started with the classic foie gras which was delicious, the homemade bread was the best ever.

We had some of our neighbors brussel sprouts and lamb.

Then came our beef for two, which was probably the best beef dish I've ever had. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

Our waiter was great, I'm not sure of his name he was very nice and helpful since neither of us can read or speak French we were completely dependent on him. 

My complaint would be that the beef for two is WAY, WAY too much food for two people. We were obviously visitors to Montreal and I felt so bad about wasting the food. Please either do a smaller portion or warn patrons.. The beef is enough for four! 

Also if you are sitting on the patio/garden bring your shades!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant by the people that own and operate Joe Beef. Again, expect massive portions in a tiny setting...reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"As I was not able to book a table at Joe Beef, I thought this might be a nice hangout for someone new to Montreal for a date night!! 

My impressions are : 

1- Squeezing challenge
I had to squeeze my way through everything in this restaurant starting from hanging your coat (which was the first hurdle I faced after entering the place- to support my coat over 30 other garments on a hanger that is overly packed to) then to squeeze my entire body through a table of two men (who did not think for a moment out of courtesy to mover their bodies or perhaps elbows for me to get into my seat- and obviously the host did not bother to move the table in or out for me to walk in freely- I had to utilize my acrobatic skills in front if my date which was not classy) 
2- Eye sight challenge
I was asked by the host to stand in front of a blackboard under very dimmed light to check out the menu (because they have no paper menus and the waiter refused to mention what they have in terms of food initially) 

So again I had to squeeze out from my premium seat and stand in front of a wall with other fellow dinners and try to understand the French writing !!! In smaller than 10 font size with very little light 
I have been to restaurants that have this kind of blackboard menus (pubs and trendy restaurants) but in all places I have tried, there is always a) a paper form of menu
b) some sort of well lit blackboard with medium size font
 c) fewer choices of food !! 
After failing to read the extensive menu at Liverpool House 
I asked the waitress for help- she instructed that I have to look at the board 
I replied that I did but my eye sight is very bad and I did not want to wear my reading glasses in front of my date !!(obviously this date did not call again) 
She suggested the fish which was nice 
But again I wanted to try the wine ( which again was written on a separate board) but realized it is going to be hard to leave my seat , attempt to read, Order and drink, and then try to go to the toilet !! 
I adopted the strategy of not moving from my seat till I leave .. 
Not sure why this restaurant is popular but again I will give it another try in day light - this could never happen actually as they only open for dinner!!"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for my bachelor party and we were unable to get a table for Joe Beef. So we defaulted to booking Liverpool House. Super glad, we were able to get a table! 

I loved the rustic feel of Liverpool House, it really made us feel like we were away from home (The States). 

As a group of six guys on a bachelor party, we ordered just as six men would. Tons of meat. 

We started with a veal tartare and the raw bar; Both Maine and New Brunswick oysters, Uni on the half shell. 
Oysters were fresh and crisp, served with a tart mignonette and cocktail sauce. The uni was fresh and a bit slimy. Didn't have much brine to them at all. 

For the mains, we did both of their family style sets: a 32oz bone in rib eye, which was cooked perfectly medium rare and placed over a brown bone marrow sauce and the lamb, which was prepared in three ways. 

Service was fantastic, our server was gracious and was a great host. She kept calling one of our friends \"sweet tea\" cause he tried ordering it in the beginning. 

Would love to come back if I ever find myself in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Just wow! Great menu with a lot of very shareable plates clearly for people who want to have unusual focused dishes not a meat and sides place but there's still things to appeal to most. Take a picture of the menu if your not seated near by. Wine list is fabulous. Beautiful desserts (but huge) loved the fois parfait. Veal Tartare was well prepared.  Fois breakfast sandwich was yummy. Get the potato wedges."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but this is one of those restaurants that squeeze tables together to maximize the number of seats. You end up being uncomfortably close to strangers sitting an elbow length away. You can't even get out from your seat without moving the table which is a real issue since the only menu they have is a chalkboard on the far wall of the restaurant. The food was very mediocre and overpriced. What I DID love were the oysters. Fresh and delicious. I fail to see what all the hype is about and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Always a great meal here. Read the reviews.... all spot on. From the Lobster pasta to the steak, every bite was amazing. 

If you're a large group, and the weather is nice, my recommendation is the private party in the back porch with your very own private space. Enjoy dining with your friends or family in there outdoor space while enjoying their rich, amazing dishes. 

Always on the list to go to when in Montreal. Heard great things about Joe Beef too but it's a hard spot to reserve and the food is basically the same."}
{"text":"First impressions of the decor is weird it reminded me of a sugar shack. All the menus are written on the wall in chalk. We were seated right in front of these walls and people would constantly pass by to take pictures and bring it back to their table. Ruined the mood of our table with constant flashes going off

Being 6 we tried most of the popular things on the menu. Personally I had:

HorseTartare- which was simply amazing. Had the slightest over taste touch of Dijon. 

Liverpool Steak- the med-rare cook was done perfectly for a 14oz steak the spinach side was perfect

Pecan maple syrup tartlet- was average 

The biggest issue of the night was we revived one total bill. We then asked to have the bills split we were told \"it's joe beefs policy to provide one bill\" we then spent 15mins splitting up our 550$ bill to make sure we included taxes and tip. The waitress was perfect up until this point. You could see she was not happy with this policy and kind of took it out on us. 

Food 4.5 star
Service 3
Business policy on bills 0
We won't be returning"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk here! The food, wine and service are really that amazing! We had so much off the menu: the duck, the pork belly (insane, simply insane), the rabbit, the artic char (it has bacon in it, FYI), and the potato wedges (which need a new name that fits their incredible deliciousness). Seriously, I'm so upset I could only eat here once during our stay. I will be back as soon as I can get to Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Tout simplement malade! Tout est bon. 
Nous étions 8. Chacun des plats différents. 
Agneau: la viande fond en bouche. L'assaisonnement parfaite.
Pâtes au homard: crémeuse et goûte de l'homard. Morceau de vrai homard! La carcasse en fait foi. Sauce fait avec réduction d'homard! 
Lapin: la sauce est succulente.
Canard: parfaitement exécuté. 
Les légumes d'accompagnement sont choisi avec soins. 
Je vous fais grâce des entrées et des desserts!
Et le tout en très (trop) bonne quantité. 
Bonne appétit!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had this year. Truly amazing. We went with a good crew from work, which meant we could order almost the whole menu. It was off the hook. I only wish a) I wasn't pregnant because the wines were great and b) I had fasted because I started running out of room. 



My two favs were the brussel sprouts and the chicken which had an insane sauce. Bust in all seriousness, everything was pretty much perfectly executed. 

Space is simple, drafty and small but service was great and really it is all about the food.  I would eat it sitting on the floor if that was the only option. 

I will go back as soon as I am in Montreal again and would recommend it as my top pick for the city. 

Go. End of story."}
{"text":"Went here for my grandmother's 85th birthday dinner - party of 6 ladies. It was a bit loud of an environment for my grandmother but since she can't really hear even in a quiet spot, it didn't really affect the awesome meal we had. Everything we ate was spectacular - beginning with oysters and burrata. I picked off of everyone's entrees but got the pakora appetizer as my main. Since I tried everything, I decided I was going to rate everyone's dishes and decide who's was best... well - that ended up being quite the difficult task considering everything tasted so great. If I had to pick, it was the pasta dish with lobster that my aunt and cousin shared. We had dessert and wine which were both really good. Everyone left very satisfied - including my grandmother. It was a bit pricey ($600 bill) but we decided it was totally worth it. Our server was also very sweet and helpful - although she did forget to split the bill and bring it to my sister who requested it at the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had.  We went big and got more food than we needed and it was worth it.  Every single thing was in the conversation for best dish I've had in years.  Menu changes so I suggest discussing the meals with you informed waiter/waitress to plan out your meal."}
{"text":"Somewhat slow service, very heavy food and extremely loud. The food is good, just not ideal for dinner.

If you're into lobster pasta, steak, etc., this is a very good option to visit with friends."}
{"text":"We lucked out big time when our concierge scored us a reservation here.

We were seated on an outdoor covered patio in the back of the restaurant. I love the vibe inside, but especially love the patio as it is quieter and quite atmospheric in a laid back sort of way.

Our server was very nice and helpful.

For appetizers we ordered rabbit pasta with fettuccine and pea sauce. It was so good I would give it 10 stars. It is not always on the menu, but if it is when you go, I recommend a large order of it as your main. We ordered Lobster Pasta (they're known for it) and a steak. Both were delicious. The lobster pasta is a large order and very rich. I recommend the smaller size, as I couldn't finish it and I almost always finish everything. The lobster was sweet and delicious and the creamy red sauce was perfection. My husband's steak was good, but not as good as the other things. Our desserts were fabulous. I had the profiteroles and he had a brioche with creme fresh ice cream. He raved about it. 

I recommend you make a reservation as soon as you book your flight!"}
{"text":"Came her with my boyfriend and his family. The ambiance was perfect for any type of crowd. The service was really good, quick and efficient. The wine suggestion was also right on. We ordered lobster spaghetti, pork shoulder and fish. Everything was good. We also tried most of their desserts that all tasted amazing. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. My favorite spot in all of North America. Everything about this place is 5-star from the food, to the service to the ambiance and decor. I'm also so happy they finally added actual menus so you no longer have to hover over another table and read the handwritten blackboard. That drives me nuts in restaurants and I hope that trend finally goes away. 

I've been here probably a dozen times and never left disappointed (or hungry). The lobster spaghetti is absolutely decadent. Suckling pig, superb. The smoked meat sandwich croquettes were awesome and wish they'd bring those back. But I love trying new things there as I've never had anything I didn't love."}
{"text":"Before we talk Liverpool House, let's talk Joe Beef. Mr. Beef is high on my restaurant bucket list (inclusive of not unpopular dining establishments like Noma, Jiro, and liquor-licensed Taco Bell). Unlike some other luminaries, I finally had a clear and easy shot at checking this off the list, thanks to a friend's decision to host his bachelor party in Montreal. Quite unfortunately, despite a couple month's advance warning, reservations were not to be had. Getting through to via phone Joe Beef is an ordeal in itself, let alone speaking to someone in a rational manner in order to procure said reservation. Alas.

The biggest hangup was our large party (of 10), but our coordinator sold us (and Mr. Beef's purveyors) on Liverpool House, Joe's younger, larger sister restaurant. So while Joe Beef remains bucketed, I at least had a chance to sample the goods. I apologize profusely for the lack of photographic evidence, as Liverpool's hearty spread was enough to feed a small army, and quite deliciously, I might add. I chalk it up to a full slate of day drinking prior, and we were just lucky enough that the groom-to-be made it through the evening. A prix fixe dinner with something like 7 different courses and plates ended up coming to a very respectable price, not inclusive of the mountains upon mountains of Old Fashioneds or something other whiskey cocktails that we ended up ordering that night.

The highlights are the meats, obviously, anything meat. Like Joe Beef, Liverpool House's menu is always chalkboarded, such that the only menu I have is questionably stored in my noggin. However, I do remember the lobster spaghetti, and it's good. To quote Joe Beef aficionado Anthony Bourdain, damn good. The red meat, of which we received two kinds, boneless and bone-in, were also phenomenal. Starter oysters? Yes.

The whole evening was an exercise in pure, gluttonous decadence. And while I didn't technically get Joe Beef in my mouth, I still came away feeling plenty satisfied."}
{"text":"{Foodie Rant} I woke up thinking about a Lobster Spaghetti...Litrerally a lobster bisque with cream and brandy tossed with perfectly cooked spaghetti and GIANT pieces of lobster at Liverpool House in Montréal. 

The waiter, aka liaison to all things heavenly, told us that last week they received a letter from a man on death row requesting this dish in Minnesota- I can see why! 

This is the most laid back high end restaurant I have ever been to. The vibes are spot on. Incredible food with incredible service- the highlight of our trip!


Do yourself a favor and make reservations here BEFORE you come, you won't want to miss it!"}
{"text":"If you can't get reservations for Joe Beef (who can?! I tried 6wks before my visit and everything was booked up for the 4days I was in Montreal) then get a reservation here.  Sister restaurant to Joe, you will get the same quality here - it's just more laid back.

I sat at the bar and ordered the lobster spaghetti.  It was creamy and the pasta perfectly al dente and it came with big chunks of lobster still in the shell (they make you work for your food here!).  The portion is big so pace yourself!

For dessert I had a grapefruit meringue thing - it wasn't too sweet (my preference) and had a fresh, slightly tart taste .

I know people are disappointed when they can't get into Joe's so they think coming here is a let down but honestly put this place on your list to try out!

The decor is quaint and the service is exceptional!  I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"It was Liverpool House that saw the exciting occasion of Meat Fest 2015 during my recent visit to Montreal. Sure, it was my own littler personal fiesta but by no means does that mean it wasn't a grand, greedy and glorious affair. 

There was wine (lots), raw meats (horse tartare), giant slabs of meat (hanger steak in a barley and beef cheek sauce) and the token vegetable (brussel sprouts). Two of us ate and ate until we threw down our steak knives in defeat and congratulated our sensible wearing of comfy pants, with the clinking of wine glasses high above the table. 

Don't dilly daddle, make a reservation today so you, too, can enjoy your own Meat Fest."}
{"text":"Arrived at our reserved time and were seated promptly for 2 persons. I was surprised to see that the menu was written on a wall in the back and that there was no actual one at the table where we were seated near the front of the restaurant. So I took a photo to bring back to the table. But the menu is all in French so I didn't really know what to order on, but In the end we just asked for their suggestions and were not disappointed. 
Tried a their light joe beef beer which was alright. Then started with a dozen oysters, which were great., and had a foi grai breakfast sandwich which was not pate and seared placed in a delicious breakfast sandwich covered with local maple syrup. And the main entree composed of three small filets of horse meat covered with a special brown sauce. And to end, the pound cake.
Service was very good, staff friendly, and a hip atmosphere right next to their big brother joe beef. It was my first dinner after arriving in Montreal and that probably helped with making it an awesome experience. But unfortunately I might have tipped a bit less due to the misinterpretation of the separate tax charge that reads T.P.S. on the receipt."}
{"text":"Swimming pool liver
Best meal of my life so far
Go eat all the things!

This place is totally worth being rejected at Joe Beef for. FYI this is the brother (sister?) restaurant to Joe Beef. Same guys made it, and so, it should show as just as delish. I don't know, because I didn't eat at Joe Beef. (Lesson learned: make reservations at these places.) But, darn it, it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten. And for less that $100? An absolute steal!!!!!! 

And it's not like one of those expensive meals that are 3 bites worth of food. It's a ton of food, and you will want to eat it all.

I could barely understand the menu in English or French. When the waiter explained, I looked for words that I understood, and this is what happened: I went twice in my one week trip. I think I ate some oysters, beer, sausage, rabbit, lobster pasta, pork shoulder, chicken, foie gras, bread, zucchini bread, roast carrots, potatoes, potato salad, roast brussel sprouts, some ridiculous cheese stuffed with more cheese, beer, and some ridiculous gin and earl grey tea concoction. 

And dessert. Go for the sorbets. They are amazing.

I went by myself and was seated at the bar. Lone dining is kind of sad, and so I befriended a Torontonian who was also rejected at Joe Beef and we shared some of our food stuff. I spent about $80 by myself (oysters, beer, entree, dessert, complimentary shot, tax and tip). 

I ate so much, and I at all the things. It hurt so good.

I went with a group of 8 people. FYI if you have more than 6 people (there are 7 in my family) then you have to eat family style (thank the food gods). This means that you can't all order your own entrees, and you shouldn't, the portions here are super generous, and worth every bite and every penny. We didn't order very many drinks, and all in all spent $60 per person (all the foods, tax and tip). 

If you are looking for a world class dining experience, wonderful friendly service, generous portions, and a price that can't be beat. This is it, and you'll be disappointed as you meet all your future meals after this one. 

Also, they'll pack left-over doggie bags for you."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Loved that the wine and food menus were written on a chalkboard. The decor was lovely. 

The Brussels sprouts were to-die for. I could've eaten that as my entree. The cauliflower, on the other hand, was so-so.

The fish and chicken were out of this world! My boyfriend and I were so stuffed by the end of the meal because we are every last bite.

I gave it four stars because, although I live in NYC, it was quite pricey (we didn't even get wine because it was so expensive). Definitely worth going to for a special occasion and for an incredible meal.
Made our Montreal visit lovely."}
{"text":"Very good! I really love that restaurant. Be aware that is expensive but is worth it. I always start with the oyster and a good glass of wine wine b4 to order my diner"}
{"text":"As the most interesting guy in the world says, \"I don't often dine extravagantly when in Montreal, but when I do it's at Liverpool House.\" In late at night from NY and (train) starved - about at the border I realized a nice tender lamb dish was something I needed, whatever it took. I texted my ride on running late and the plan was laid. Joe Beef. But that had a wait of 1.5 hours. Plan B (on J Beef recommendation  was next door to Liverpool House - same owners). No reservations in a packed house but a small table opened in 10 minutes and they got us in. 
Water: ordered carbonated bottled, my ride ordered glass of Grigo, and I a bottle of craft Wheat Caster ale. 
We ordered/shared a cold vegetable plate enhanced with some cockles and plenty of seasonal, slightly marinated radishes, spring potatoes, green beans, etc. We described what we had in mind to our waiter and narrowed the main courses down to sharing the lamb roast, a very large cut perfectly done with a raspberry relish accompaniment and pine nuts - served on a large platter swimming in juices and flavor, flavor, flavor. broiled cauliflower alongside. The lamb was probably the finest I can remember  enjoying--all expectations exceeded. As a side we made a valiant attempt at finishing a risotto dish. Did I say we trusted our waiter, a friendly and sufficiently attentive sort, on wine? I took him up on a French red to pair with the joint. The wine list is a challenge in the setting (dim, tight, boisterous with happy couples and parties) and almost inaccessible  above and behind a few of the cramped tables. 
We shared a pistachio pastry the next table recommended and what a treat it was - I had a cappuccino and took home almost half the lamb we'll serve as hors d'ourves tomorrow. This will be a hit. 
If you are worried about the cost, you ought not opt to dine here. It is expensive. Roast, two sides, dessert, 1 cappuccino, 2 glasses select wine, 1/2 litre beer and tip totaled approximately $240 CDN. I will be back again this Fall to follow the ever-changing menu where it will lead."}
{"text":"Disappointed!

A 9:30 reservation turned out to be an offer of a bar booth or wait. We waited and first sat about 10:30. The waitress took about 30 minutes before she came over and took very little time with us explaining the all in French blackboard menu. Once we decided on a few well known to me choices ( only because I read my fellow Yelpers reviews), we waited at least a half hour for our first course, fresh oysters. At one point about 15 minutes into the wait, I asked for bread as it was already close to 11 and we were starving. She finally brought over bread (actually tasty bread) and then the oysters followed 15 minutes later. So now it's well after 11, we have consumed a great deal of wine and the appetite is waning. The oysters were very delicious as was the horseradish sauce for topping.

Another 15 minutes, now 11:30 out comes the 4 appetizers. Mozzarella salad with bacon (actually a burrata and quite good) , a beet salad, a ricotta dish and a Bellini with gravlax with caviar. All were very good and were the type of dishes I was hoping for but would have enjoyed so much better at 10:15/10:30 when I wasn't drunk, tired and a bit annoyed.

The mains were the lobster spaghetti and the hanger steak. Both excellent tasting but as above its now almost midnight, I'm drunk from the  long wait, too much wine, no food and I'm first eating my dinner.

So now the host comes over who I admit was a very nice guy but I wish he would have checked on us an hour earlier. I asked him if this was typical and he told me that it was a holiday crowd but typically it is this busy.  He was very apologetic and offered anything we would like. By this time we were quite tired. The waitress brought over her self chosen classic chocolate cake with ice cream and 4 cappuccino. Along with dessert, a few after dinner drinks. 

The waitress told us the drinks, dessert and coffee were on the house. 

This is such a crazy review for me to write. On one hand, early lousy attention to their customer put a major damper on the meal and experience. On the other hand, excellent creative food and a highly apologetic staff who did the right thing by comping us the above. So confused by this restaurant. 

For now a 3 star rating because a restaurant this well known, with creative genius chefs and $49 lobster spaghetti dish, should have got it right from the start.  As a tourist only here for 3 nights, I would have really like to have been wowed by the experience overall as other Yelpers have reviewed.

Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Was told by some locals that Joe Beef was a must have while we were in town, unfortunately, we were unable to make a reservation and attempted to squeeze ourselves into the Liverpool House instead by sitting at the bar. I'm more of a \"sit at the bar\" type of gal myself, so had no trouble with this suggestion. Our only mistake while here was that we ordered wine by the glass instead of the bottle, because we eventually drank the whole bottle.

As for food, we started with the Foie gras, which I was super worried about. My boyfriend urged me to give it a try and I actually really enjoyed the dish. For our entree, we opted for the Lobster Spaghetti, and I would swear on my unborn child that this is the best seafood pasta dish I have ever enjoyed (I'm from Florida, I know seafood). Honestly, I can't remember if we got dessert or not because of the wine. But, I do recall that our bartender was so friendly and helpful.

Near the end of the night, after dessert, he asked if we wanted coffee. I never drink coffee but figured a cappuccino might help get me out of my seat. When asked if I needed sugar, I replied: Bring me all your sugar. He brought about 7 full jars of sugar, it was a you need to be there moment. At the end, he gave us a shot on the house 'cause he thought we were humorous. All in all, this was our best meal in Montreal and I will absolutely return the next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the clam shooters. First time having clam I was a bit scared. No worries, it worked out well. Our waitress Suzzanne, was an attractive 20-something that knew her food well. Her personality definitely made the meal fun. The blackboard menu was a kind of cool tre-shiek touch, but unfortunately as a dumb American, I don't speak French. However, Suzzanne was helpful to figure out the menu and made some great recommendations.

I also went to Garden Manger and thought that was better than this place, but overall, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was cozy! The Liverpool House has the tried and true \"everything menu-related is written on a blackboard on the wall\" method of choosing your food and it was fine when we got there, there weren't many people around, but when it got packed, it got really packed.  I guess the best solution then is to just listen to what your server tells you to choose, because quite frankly, he knew his stuff! 

We had some amazing oysters, but I will have to say the highlight of the meal was asparagus with shrimp and Béarnaise sauce!  For our main courses we went with Sea Bream and Clams, and Duck dishes. They were good just not as good as our appetizers (we could have ate that the whole night away). 

Overall for a restaurant that I had been waiting to try for a few years, the experience was great, we couldn't move afterwards because of how full we were, so sadly, we had to turn dessert away!"}
{"text":"Came with high expectations and was underwhelmed.  I ordered the foie gras de cochon for appetizer and it was very rich and buttery, pretty good but couldn't finish the 3 pieces it came with.  The green salad was pretty good with cauliflower, lettuce.  I tried the Liverpool steak medium rare and it was pretty good but not impressed.  I thought it didn't have much salt or seasoning at all.  The spinach was pretty good and pickle was an odd side dish.  I also tried the half order of lobster spaghetti which was more than enough.  The lobster was good and I really liked the spaghetti in a rich creamy buttery sauce but half size was enough for me.  Service was pretty nonexistent and waitress didn't really explain the menu which was written in chalkboard in French in the corner and forgot our drinks.  It also took forever to get our food.  For the price, I expected better."}
{"text":"Bottom line: this place is super solid. 

We went here as part of a Montreal weekend where my wife is trying to emulate Anthony Bourdain \"Layover\" in Montreal. We hit the usual spots over the previous 24h: Schwartz , Fairmont etc. All as expected and I am feeling the Montreal groove. We head here because we can't get in to Joe Beef- so let's do the sister resto. 

As we arrive in the 'hood I am feeling it's the Montreal version of Oz/Dundas in the centre of the Universe (Canada style). On arrival, it looks and feels cool but the initial reception is bland and the server cool. The cocktail offering, completely cookie cutter. I am thinking \"Jenn Agg smokes these jokers at the Hoof\". 

From then on however it's an onslaught of excellence. Great wine list. We had the Monts Damnes Sancerre. The food after that was just spectacular. The usual Quebec superb lineup of foie and later cheeses. Lamb, bass, and lobster spaghetti were stars. 

Vibe: crackling. Tunes: Classic Seger followed by perfect Stones as we nibbled foie gras. (You have to be there I guess but it seems like they read my mind). And the server is terrific at this point. 

Bottom line is I have to give thumbs up to this member of the Montreal lineup. It just doesn't get much better. Anywhere."}
{"text":"Made the journey to the famous Joe Beef people's second restaurant. We were not disappointed. 

Staff was friendly and helpful. As the other reviewers stated, the menu is on the chalk board and all in French. Ask questions and you'll be helped! Most of it changes all the time, so be prepared to choose something different. 

We started with the beer cheese appetizer and a Joe Beef pilsner. Both were great. 

For entrees, we chose the lobster pasta (permanent menu item) and a Cornish game hen. Both were tremendous. Perfect amount for a couple to share. 

We finished the night with a dessert that was half chocolate pudding, half chocolate mousse (I can't remember the name of it) and two coffees! 

This was a great dinner. I can't wait to go again, as well as checking out Joe Beef. 

As an extra surprise, the prices were cheaper than I expected for a 4 dollar sign joint. You can get out of there for under $100 with two apps and an entre."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much. A coworker had recommended this place to me and originally I wasn't able to get a reservation a week in advance online. However when I called, they were able to squeeze us in for dinner at 5 and I was STOKED. Maybe I overhyped myself for it too much but we were all left a  little disappointed. My sister ordered the lobster spaghetti without the bacon because she is pescatarian. The spaghetti was good but it wasn't the best spaghetti I've ever had.. perhaps it was the lack of bacon that made the difference? We also ordered a steak dish that was a bit lackluster. The highlights of the meal were definitely the appetizers of scallops, eel nuggets, and eggplant but the entrees were a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Having had an spectacular experience at Joe Beef on my last trip to Montreal, I gave the sister restaurant Liverpool House a try.

Like with Joe Beef, service was great and food was excellent.  However, I think Joe Beef is significantly better than Liverpool House.  The menu at LH is smaller and seems to feature the franchise's 'greatest hits' whereas Joe Beef seems more seasonal and experimental.  I do appreciate that LH seems more bar-casual (not that JB is 'stiff' in any sense).

The lady and I enjoyed all the dishes and they were accommodating in modifying some dishes to suit her pescatarian diet.  I finally got the lobster spaghetti as it was $35 (was told it's a smaller portion than the $55 portion at JB).  It sounded reasonable for one person to take it on, so I ordered it as-is (as it comes with bacon).  Even without our excessive ordering, the spaghetti should be shared between 2 - 3 people.  The dish was insanely rich and decadent.  The only 'downside' is that we were completely stuffed at the end, we probably would have enjoyed it more if we didn't over-order (our server at JB correctly told us to stop ordering after he felt we had already ordered 'enough'... and he was right).

There was a slight snafu and they messed up on our order and we got additional dessert for free.  The complimentary basque cake was splendid.  The only black mark on the night: we ordered the 'corn ice cream eclair' because it sounded interesting - it tasted like something you would get a county fair.

Overall, had a good experience at Liverpool House, but I prefer Joe Beef.  Will try out their newer restaurant, Vin de Papillon (all 3 being on the same street) next time."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My friend and I split the lobster spaghetti and the NY Strip steak.  It's definitely one of the best meals I've ever had.  The spinach and carrots were delicious.  I'd love to stop in early one evening for a drink at the bar and some oysters.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal.  Next time I want to see if I can buy some of their steak sauce.  So good!"}
{"text":"Liverpool House is fantastic. After a great meal the day before at Joe Beef, we decided we had to eat here as well, so we came at opening.
We had a delicious beet panzella, a fresh pasta with sausage and mushrooms, a fish special, and a pork shoulder steak. So so good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Wait staff was fantastic!  Order a Bloody Mary with a raw Oyster (beautiful).  Dishes at our table included the 1/2 Roasted Chicken (sauce was to die for), Roasted Duck (Another sauce to die for), Oysters on the half shell (they don't get better than these), Rabbit (perfectly prepared).  If they are making the brussel sprouts and you don't like brussel sprouts...think again this was one of the best dishes I had ever tasted.  Don't forget dessert...Toffee pudding or a tart.  Thank God we couldn't get reservations at Joe Beef!  Soon the Liverpool House will be impossible to get into as well.  Next trip to Montreal, book an evening and prepare to be delighted!"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here and were seated right away. We started with a mix of oysters which were some of the freshest i have had. We then ordered the rabbit croquettes and horse meat tartare which were both delicious. I then ordered the lobster spaghetti which was not bad the lobster was great although i was expecting more from the spaghetti and the sauce. The serive was great and overall it was a great dinner. With drinks this all came to about $100 pp."}
{"text":"220 dollar meal, and the entre was inedible. I sent it back. Yes, they told me I didn't need to pay for it - but that's not remotely the point. I came here to eat dinner, not go home hungry. Do NOT order the duck. Awful. If I could write another bad review I would."}
{"text":"went there about two weeks ago ordered the spring salad which came to the table luke warm two bites into it i cracked a tooth on a small rock in the salad. after which i contacted the manager \"james\" who was very  apologetic. continued my dining experience with a pork dish that was terrible more pork fat than pork. for the cost of the dinner there are better places in montreal this is alot of hype and food sucks. just nobody wants to tell you because it's not chic to say. by the way the tooth cost $500 usd to fix i still haven't heard from the owners. watch out for the warm salad."}
{"text":"The food was excellent had the fois gras breakfast sandwich for a appetizer which was on a English muffin with egg, bacon, fois gras and maple syrup also has the lobster spaghetti and the special half a duck both were delicious and staff was very attentive would go back again the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Better than Joe Beef!
Excellent raw food, oysters from PEI and scallop were above the world! 
The steak was pretty awesome too. 
A bit noisy and service was not good."}
{"text":"The staff couldn't have been any nicer, or more fun, or accommodating.  Top notch.  The food is fantastic!!  I was with a group so we did our best to try as much as we could.  Bread & butter, pickles, mushroom bread, tomato salad.  All amazing.  I had a chicken and mushroom dish which was comforting, savory, and just right.  The only draw back is that the menu is all on one chalkboard in the main room.  Its a little awkward. A very minor detail I think."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.....but 2.50 for bread and 1 microscopic cube of butter? Stay classy Liverpool house"}
{"text":"I just left one of the worst meals of our life. My husband literally spit out his duck on the plate because it was so poorly prepared.  As we are only in Montreal for the weekend, we are extremely disappointed that this is now going to be our reference for food here.  I highly recommend you do not eat here and go to the other restaurants that were recommended and I wish I had chosen instead. The restaurant overall was extremely expensive and the food was some of the worst we have ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently decided to spend my 35th birthday in Montreal and as soon as that decision was made I immediately rushed to try to get a reservation at any of the Joe Beef restaurants. Having already been to Joe Beef and loving it, I was really excited when I managed to snag a table for 2 on a Saturday night at 7 at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.

The service was fantastic and attentive. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable with wines and when we told her what we were going to have she went looking for some great wines to pair. The wines were all between $60-$100 also so all within a reasonable price point (I just can't justify any more than $100 for a bottle of wine).

The food of course did not disappoint either. We started with a very thinly sliced rib eye on toast special which was probably my wife's favourite dish. For mains I decided to go for the beef in Joe Beef and had the steak which came with steak sauce, horseradish and pickle on the side. My wife went for the lobster spaghetti which I also tried and was incredible. The shocker was we ordered some brussel sprouts on the side and these stole the show. Definitely the best brussel sprouts I've ever had with so much incredible flavour.

Overall I have no complaints and would definitely head back to any of the Joe Beef restaurants."}
{"text":"Loved that restaurant! Wasn't too sure about going to that neighborhood but was convinced by my good friend. Well what a surprise!
This place is charming, old house feel, cozy, warm and so casual yet fancy. The staff is wonderful, we started at the bar with some fresh oysters and beer (I had a rose) and we sat at the best table (according to my taste). We were facing the chalkboard so we had direct access to the menu while seating. We did have to get up to check out the wine list chalkboard but it was okay. We had \"hareng fume\", Beets, and I forget!! We ordered SO much food! It was delicious and very different from any other place, they have their own unique genre. Samia was our server and she was absolutely wonderful, smiling, happy and full or recommendation. It was a great experience and I would go back anytime....but this time to sit at the bar, my fav always!! Yay! I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"Despite the oddly matched 90's-early 2000's underground hip hop soundtrack playing while Jean Claude Van Damme's dance scene in \"Kickboxer\" was on the TV at the bar, despite the menus being on the wall in the other room right over a table of people, and despite the outrageously priced cocktails and limited bourbon stock.....

HOLY HELL. SO GOOD. Started with oysters with vinagrette and old fashioned cocktails all around. The oysters were some of the best I've had. It was kind of nice not knowing their name, where they were from, just oysters. I ordered a second round; that good. 

We ordered a round of \"entrees,\" including a foie gras maple syrup petit dejeuner, fresh mozzarella on toast, and rigatoni. The foie gras dish left all all trying really hard not to lick the plate, so we actually borrowed toast from the mozzarella to mop up every last molecule on the plate. 

But the star of the night was the main plate I ordered, a steak with wine sauce and beer cheese cream. This was one of those dishes that stays with you, almost haunts you, for months. I'll never have this combination of flavors again in my life, so while I ate it I didn't really want it to end. A perfectly cooked piece of meat, placed in a red wine sauce with a sharp, bitter whipped beer cheese topping. Bitter, salty, sweet, juicy...it was unreal. We all tried each other's dishes, including lobster spaghetti, scallops, and trout, but nothing stood up to this piece of beef. 

The waiter was very good and very funny, describing horse meat the best way he could to three Americans not used to seeing it on menus. It's pretty loud, maybe not best for romance, but as a spot for a social evening, it's very fun. There's clearly some talent back in that kitchen, and if I make it back to Montreal, I'm heading here right from the airport...maybe after a stop at Dieu du Ciel!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Had a fun atmosphere and the place was packed on a Saturday night.  Food was good and managed to sample a few options from the menu.  We tried the Oysters, Sprouts, Gnocchi and one more special

My only slight issue was I felt you were rushed to look at the chalkboard menu, however the server really made up for that by talking us through it and giving us some tips.

Reason for 4 stars although food was all very good, nothing mind blowing... would recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Ten years ago the most likely thing to get stabbed by a fork in this part of town was not a beautiful piece of veal.

The place screams gentrification.  In a good way.  It's high quality food and drink, but served in a way that makes you think that you're actually involved somehow in the preparation of the product.   The whole thing feels kinda adventurous.   The whole thing feels authentic.  You are the hipster hero.

The warm decor.  The awesome staff.  The beautiful room.  The great bar.

You don't only feel cooler after eating here, you quite actually ARE cooler after eating here.  

It's a pricey restaurant that strives to appear accessible.    The neighborhood locals don't eat here because apparently the owner's a dick.... but that's all most likely part of the program.

The bottom line.  It's truly an excellent place for dinner.    Currently one of the best restaurants in a place known for truly outstanding restaurants."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal at Liverpool House,seated at a corner table immediately and our drink selections arrive soon after.
We left our dinner selections largely up to our waiter and could not have done better if we tried.
Oysters on the 1/2 shell,Tender Tartar de Cheval and breakfast Foie Gras to start. house celery salad,rare hanger steak,wiener schnitzel with fresh green peas and spaetzle with a gin soaked pineapple dessert to finish.

We simple love the friendly and excellent service,the space and above all, the expertly prepared dishes that Liverpool House consistently offers and as creatures of habit ...we'll be back."}
{"text":"They definitely think they are hot shit, it's one of those \"see and be seen places\".  I was tempted to fart real loudly just to bring it back down to planet earth."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  Couldn't get into Joe Beef so we opted for Liverpool House and were not disappointed at all.  The food was magnificent!  The wait staff was incredible and nice and helpful.  Need a better beer selection though.  Only complaint was that we waited long for our food, so make sure you come with time to spare.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing, from service to food. Unfortunately we ate so much, didn't have room for dessert. Worth the trek from NYC."}
{"text":"another great place to go if you can't get info joe beef, I had a bunch of stuff, all great and super good cocktails."}
{"text":"Sat outside in the garden as part of a group dinner with a pre-set menu. Knowing that pre-set usually means lots of meat in Montreal, I explained that I was a pesce-tarian with a restricted diet and they quickly jumped to absolutely the best hospitality. The pasta I was served was absolutely delicious and the fish served - both trout and halibut were perhaps the best I've ever had. I will no doubt return to this location on my next visit to Montreal. So delicious, beautifully presented and above & beyond service. Thanks for making me feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"We had so much food and a delicious wine pairing.  The waiter did an excellent job with helping us pick out the unique and flavorful foods."}
{"text":"As soon as we booked a weekend trip to Montreal, an all-out Saturday night dinner at Liverpool House was put on the agenda for what we hoped would be not only a solid meal but a highlight of our visit. Even coming in with high expectations, Liverpool House was one of the best meals we've ever had.

We speak very limited French and our waiter was incredibly patient and helpful talking us through a few suggestions based on the meal we were looking to have. He pointed us toward starting with oysters that were so fresh and delicious on their own that they needed no accompaniments despite a really tempting cocktail sauce on the table that begged to be added. An amazing artichoke crostini with a creamy cheese spread across the bread followed and disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived. 

For our main course, we had the Liverpool Steak medium rare - 16 ounces of perfectly cooked meat that will be the standard to which all future steaks are judged. The lobster spaghetti was indulgent even by our standards but considering the plate was practically licked-clean we obviously had no regrets. 

We ended the meal with capuccinos and the only dish of the night that wouldn't qualify as a \"best thing I've ever eaten.\" Maybe it was the copious amount of food we had already consumed but the Black Forest chocolate cake was forgettable. 

As for drinks, we made our way through the beers \"en fût\" with the American Pale Ale and the IPA really standing out, and just for good measure we went Canadian and had Bloody Caesars which also came with an oyster on top.  

The service was outstanding, and throughout what turned into a three hour meal (!) the atmosphere fluctuated from lively and boisterous to lower-key and calmer while always managing to retain an intimate feeling throughout. Don't be fooled by any naysayers put off by the chalkboard - Liverpool House was an incredible meal and experience, and with food and service this good they could write the menu on folded origami paper in invisible ink for all I care!"}
{"text":"11 buddies and I went here for the Formula 1 race post bachelor party and they really took care of us.

Christopher was great to work with and the food was spectacular!

I would strongly encourage anyone visiting Montreal to check it out or their sister restaurant Joe Beef.

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I got a reservation here prior to a concert at the new Corona Theater, and may I just say I totally love this area of rue Notre-Dame now, there's so many cool places.  We actually couldn't get into Joe Beef, so we tried it out.  

It's pretty cramped and I don't like the menu set-up on the walls, however, the staff are super knowledgeable and they'll get you going in the right direction no matter what.  

I was a big fan of the lobster salad starter and the oyster selection.  Everything on the menu looks delicious.  Our server was a bit quirky, but he grew on me so I can't complain.  

Note- they don't have a fully stocked bar."}
{"text":"It's almost foodie heresy to suggest it, but Liverpool House eked out Joe Beef on our trip to Montreal this snowy, freezing April.  Even without wine (which always makes a meal more enjoyable), Liverpool House had some real showstopper dishes, and had 3 foie gras options (a torchon, a tart (eaten and pictured), and the dejuner version (I'm not an egg fan and avoided, though I could see it's a beautiful thing)).  We only ordered the tart, thinking there would be much more foie to come the next night at Joe Beef, but there was hardly any to be found, and \"he who hesitates is lost\".

The most interesting menu items were the starters, so my group of 4 focused there.  Oysters were fantastic ($3.50 each), but not much more you can say about oysters other than it was a beautiful presentation.  The \"pate en croute\" was the lattice-pie object in my picture ($20) - this was a must!  The beef tartare ($16) was as good as any I've had.  I wish I'd explored further with the \"foie gras au torchon\" ($25) and the croquettes de lapin ($11), but we had a mountain of lobster spaghetti ($55) on the way, and wisely saved room for this very large and filling dish (my recommendation is to order more of the smaller plates, and a half-portion of the lobster pasta).  We also ordered an \"onglet en poivre\" ($33: a hangar steak, tonight with pepper and a blue cheese-based sauce on the end), and rounded it out with some veggies: the \"carrots roties\" were fantastic (bottom left of my photo), but the \"brocoli & grana padano\" was uninspired (just broccoli with grated parmesan). 

The \"sticky toffee\" dessert, even on a very full stomach, was amazing (thanks to the yelpers who have gone before me and highlighted it).  Again I must compare to Joe Beef and proclaim that Liverpool House was the winner in this course too.  So if you arrive at Joe's without a reservation and are directed to Liverpool, despair not!"}
{"text":"Lovely. The room is eclectic, light and unpretentious. Server attentive and warm, without hurrying. One of the best dinners we have had. Ceviche and aioli apps were really nice and went well together. We had a fois gras course (yummy) and I had trout, husband had some sausage special. Both were terrific. We had a great evening and enjoyed everything about it. Not cheap, but worth every dollar. I would go back in a minute with pleasure."}
{"text":"I will be completely honest here. I liked the place. I liked the ambiance. I liked the food. I liked the drinks. But it ends there. The only thing I FLIPPED over was the dessert which I cannot remember it was called. It was a brownie with caramel sauce and was absolutely delish if you have a super sweet tooth.

I started off with an entrée of foie gras which was great but too much for just one person. My main dish was Morue and grilled calamari but that's it. No sides (which I was unaware it didn't come with any). My boyfriend has the lobster pasta ($55!!!!... I nearly passed out). Granted you do get quite a bit of lobster.

And seriously, that's it. There was nothing that made we want to go back or nothing that blew my mind. The bill was EXTREMELY steep.

All this to say... yea, it was good. I liked it. I have nothing negative to say besides the cost. Would I go back? Probably not. I would much rather take my money and go to Pintxo for two suppers that blow my mind."}
{"text":"Dear Foodies,

We need to talk. I am fed up, really FED UP about these star chefs in Montreal getting all this glory and the royal treatment for cooking homefood. If I want to eat homefood, I'll cook at home and will probably do better work of it that these guys.

This brings me to Liverpool House. So loved and adored, even Anthony Bourdain gushes like a tingly teenage girl at a Justin Bieber concert over the chef at Liverpool House. But I have only one question about that.... WHY?

The restaurant looks pretty cool and homey, a place where you feel comfortable burning away the time, boozing and eating. There is no menu; the writing is on the wall... literally ON THE WALL. The quality of service is impeccable. The place as a whole is very welcoming, except for the noise, lotsa noise. Even if we removed the table next to us, populated by none other than Liberal MP Justin Trudeau, his lovely wife and his posse screaming and laughing like annoying 14 year olds at a McDonald's it would still be extremely noisy. But seriously this is about the food right? Yeah about that.

They have a decent menu considering the menu gets an once-over pretty regularly. As starters there was Oysters, Fried Pig Tails, Rabbit sausage and over course the ubiquitous Foie Gras plate. I had the Foie Gras of course. As a voracious Foie Gras eater, I can't resist the offering when it emerges. 

Foie Gras is a complicated love affair. It can make or break the whole experience, the better the execution, the further downhill the experience can go. And this was no exception. The chef basically re-invented the Egg McMuffin with Sausage using high end ingredients. I was offered a breakfast sammich made of some bread, firm and unyielding, some aged cheddar (me thinks) and Foie Gras... a big tasty, fatty, delicious pile of Foie Gras drizzled with Maple Syrup, topped with a perfectly fried egg. Cutting through it, releasing the egg yolk, mixing with the maple syrup, the fatty goodness of the foie gras... made for what was likely the greatest execution of a foie gras dish I have ever tasted. It was close-your-eyes-tilt-your-head-back-and-going-hmmmmmm good. And once done I gave up all decorum and fingered the remaining goo of yolk, maple syrup and fat off my plate. 

Then came the main. How the mighty have fallen. All the dishes ordered looked less than ordinary. The fish, the lobster spag, the ribs and even my plate of rabit and risotto. I find that rabbit is best served braised. To roast a bunny is to take many chances of it being dry... and dry it was. Dry enough for me to gulp down 4 glasses of water in a row. Was it good? Yeah but way freaking dry. I had to stop eating it. But that was just adding insult to injury. Let's talk risotto. The way I understand it, risotto is to be a creamy rich unctuous rice affair. The rice should be a starchy rice, a heavy rice, not a jasmine rice and oh did I mention creamy, rich and unctuous? This risotto was none of that. The frame of reference I'm talking here is Uncle Ben's precooked instant rice meals you get out of a plastic pouch which you nuke in the microwave. There were no ingredients that I could identify here that belonged in a risotto, I mean even the rice was wrong. I've never made a risotto myself but I bet I could have executed one with far greater success. The whole dish was an epic and massive failure.

The dessert, a sticky apple bread pudding thingie, was a thorough success in sugary goodness. But again, apples, maple syrup and some lemony sorbet... total win. But it was insufficient to buy back my good favors after the atrocious travesty of a risotto - an Italian would have screamed bloody murder and that dry choke-you preparation of the rabbit was unforgivable. This is especially egregious when a bistro like Via Crescent braises its bunny overnight in a ragout of carrots and celeries and sells it to you for half the price and yet never fails."}
{"text":"Quelle soirée magnifique! Nous avions réservé un table pour deux à 18h45, nous sommes arrivé avec un petit peu d'avance et avons été directement amené à notre table. Le serveur était super réactif et sympathique, comme tous ces collègues, ça ne traîne pas à cette place puis ils ont tous le sourire, ça fait vraiment plaisir. Nous avons commencé par deux entrées accompagné d'un verre de vin blanc, mon copain à pris les croquettes anguille fumée et de mon côté j'ai commandé les gnudi à la ricotta et à la betterave. Ce fut un parfait début, tout était à notre goût et vraiment bien assaisonné. Le plat fut le sommet du repas, mon copain à pris un onglet de buf accompagné d'aubergine et moi j'ai pris des pierrogies au champignon, les aubergines était un peu épicé et l'onglet parfaitement cuit, la sauce qui accompagné les pierrogies était crémeuse à souhait, j'ai bavé rien qu'en y pensant. Nous avons dévidé de finir le repas sur une note sucré donc nous avons pris l'éclair à la glace au maïs et la brioche aux pommes, je pense qu'il devrait renommer leur dessert, l'éclair n'était pas un éclair mais une profiterole et la brioche était plutôt une brioche feuilletée accompagné de pomme poêlées. Néanmoins les dessert était très bon, l'éclair manqué un peu d'acidité j'aurai aimé quelque framboise mais sinon tout était à notre goût. Nous sommes partis plus que satisfait du restaurant et j'y retournerai pour sur."}
{"text":"Only had two nights to spend in Montreal and choosing Liverpool House for one of the dinners was definitely worth it. The food was  delicious and the overall experience was just fantastic, the place is cozy with a cool vibe. Service could have been better but otherwise a great spot."}
{"text":"If your desires include superb service, remarkable food, and a wonderfully playful and relaxed atmosphere, Liverpool House is your new favorite restaurant. The carnivorous food is an amazingly honest combination of Sadist Foie Gras Worship, Canadian Pride, unpretentious but exceptional execution deeply rooted world-class technique, Zero-F*#ks-Given Bacchanalian Outrageousness, and of course gilding of the lily where appropriate - caviar on the hollandaise sauce to go with the whole roasted, vegetable stuffed, bacon wrapped cod because \"why the f%*k not\" (-Chef Ari). It is basically a modern day Roman food orgy - but one prepared by a Jewish grandmother who is convinced her bubulas are too thin with crippling anxiety that there won't be enough food (but also one who went to the store voraciously hungry to shop and might have been a bit medicated  :) while menu planning. But joking aside, Chef Ari throws down harder than anybody I have met or heard of, period, end of story. You will not find a greater alter to worship the meat gods than at Father Ari's table.

I was guided to The Liverpool House by the friendly folks at Joe Beef when planning a bachelor party for 10 people as Joe Beef didn't have the ability to seat a party larger than 7. Upon contacting Liverpool House, I spoke with the very friendly manager Chris, who explained that as a large party, I would have to go with a menu to be shared by the table which would be designed the week of our dinner. The price range was a totally reasonable $65-$85 per head. I explained to him that my crowd was going to be in town for a bachelor party and that we were the sort of folks who think that if one martini is good, 17 must be miles better. I also explained that we were all open to eating anything, but most importantly that we were generally mentally deranged gluttons who appreciate the long suffering of a goose to make our favorite food, The Foie Gras. He told me that we had definitely called the right people to satisfy the sorts of dark desires I described. As we were up from the U.S., I also requested that horse be on the menu, but otherwise I told him to leave it up to the chef.

Here is some of what arrived at our table (including ALL the Foie Gras in the Western Hemisphere)

1. 2 dozen oysters (my dining companions stupidly believed they needed more shellfish because they had no idea what else was in store - so we ordered 2 dozen more and some chilled Snow Crabs for good measure)

2a. 3 plates of Bone marrow and chicken liver mouse served with pickled veggies and amazing bread
2b. 3 plates of Local fresh mozzarella with more bomb-a$$ bread and pickled broccoli rabe

3a. 3 plates of Horse tartare (absolutely stunning) 
3b. Tasty and crispy Brussels Sprouts

4. A WHOLE Roasted Foie Gras with (get this) cinnamon raisin buns and fig preserves. DUDE - you haven't lived until you have eaten slices of this stuff and then dipped a cinnamon bun into the pan of jus and goose-foie drippings. It gave me unclean thoughts I could never even begin to tell anyone. This stuff might sound simple, but trust me, roasting a whole foie without letting it melt and getting a crust on the outside requires an exceptional chef.

Then - after the 5 rounds of appetizers, Chef Ari sends out the main course.

5a. A whole roasted local Cod, deboned, stuffed with vegetables, and wrapped with bacon - the server brought it back to be carved. It reappeared on a large platter sliced into beautiful rounds with a selection of perfectly turned root veggies and some sauce boats of HOLLANDAISE TOPPED WITH CAVIAR - are you EFFing kidding me? I was taught at a young age (maybe 6) how to make proper hollandaise, and I promptly declared it the most noble sauce in the world, a magical elixir of butter, eggs and lemon which would make even the lowly New York City Subway grab handle appealing if it cam with a side of the stuff. Chef Ari made the best better. He improved Hollandaise Sauce. Wow. What a degenerate man. What a combination of genius and insanity. What a bloody innovator! You get the point..
5b. A Rabbit, deboned, said stuffed with sausage. 
5c. 2 Massive, sweetly fatty, deliciously charred, bone-in Rib Steaks, simply grilled, with one inch thick hunks of seared foie gras on top (an originally unplanned brilliant up-sell to my group). These also came with a wonderful salad of Endive, Cress and Blue Cheese dressing. 
5d. 2 huge plates of his famous Lobster Pasta - YUM
5e. Roasted squash
5f. Simply Grilled Broccoli Rabe

After we has finished about 3/4 of it, (this group included 3 dudes in the 300lb range) I got up to ask the manager and waitstaff to plead for mercy during the desert course. 

6a. Simple, moist, delicate pound cake with ice cream and pineapple
6b. Clementine Sorbet topped with crumbled up poppy-seed astronaut ice cream
6c. Chocolate mouse stuffed cookies with hazelnuts

Chef Ari is a well-intentioned Genius with a dark side of carnivorous glutton. Eat his food. Cheers, -James"}
{"text":"We tried to get into Joe Beef (right next door), but had to settle for a late reservation at the Liverpool House.  Everything start to finish was excellent and this place is a must stop when you are in Montreal.  Menu is on a blackboard in French, but the waiter was great about walking us through everything.  We started with a Cauliflower appetizer and Brussels Sprouts Casino, both were great.  For dinner we had the Cheval (horse) and Duck which were excellent.  The toughest thing other than getting a reservation, was deciding what to eat, everything looked great"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, always packed. Be sure to make a reservation a head of time to make sure you get a table.  
They have an area for hanging your coats. It's located on the left from where you enter. 

They have both bar tables and regular tables. 

They have daily specials but we went for items on their regular menu. We ordered the lobster spaghetti and foie gras. 

Lobster spaghetti. Huge portions. Filling for two. The sauce was thick and creamy. The spaghetti was nicely cooked. 

Seared Foie gras wasn't on the menu but the chef made it for us anyways. The flavour was good, nicely seared. 

Overall, recommended if you like pasta. But besides that, a lot of the things on the menu didn't really fit our taste. However, the restaurant had great service and the chefs are willing to adjust to our preferences."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend, and had a good experience.

We only wanted wine by the glass (the wine list here is huge, and takes up a few blackboards on the walls), and was very happy with the service - the waitress asked us our preferences then came back with a few bottles to try, before we decided on what we wanted to actually have. This is something I haven't seen done before, and even though it's only a little thing, it makes a big difference to the experience.

The menu itself was interesting, and obviously changes regularly. We started with squid stuffed with lobster - it was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. The seafood here seems to be taken seriously, so I would recommend trying it when coming (I saw someone else eating the oyster plate, and had instant meal-envy). 

I had the ribs as my main, and they lived up to expectations - the meat was cooked spot-on, the sauce good and thick, and plenty of chips. I didn't expect to have such a meal at a 'gourmet' establishment, but I definitely enjoyed it.

For the dessert we had homemade doughnuts and a chocolate brownie. Both were really good (the doughnuts reminded me of Aussie doughnuts - lots of cinnamon), but I think the brownie was the winner.

The place itself is warm and cosy, and makes a great 'date venue.' It isn't cheap, but you do get quality service, food, and good atmosphere (if you want cheap, there's a 
Dilallo Burger down the road!)."}
{"text":"Loved our meal.  The server told us exactly what they had.  The selection was a nice variety so we all tried something different. We ate inside and while it was crowded we could hear each other talk most of the time.  Everyone liked everything so recommend the whole menu depending on your wishes."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent. Creative, delicious, good atmosphere, awesome waitstaff, perfect drink pairings. The buckwheat crepe with fois gras and maple sauce was out of this world. The snow crab was delicate and perfect. Indian style curried quail with bone marrow rice? Phenomenal. A dining experience to remember!"}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to the hype! The food is outstanding, but our waitress is the one who really made this a stand out dinner. Her explanations of menu items made me want to try one of everything! The food certainly leans heavy and heart -best for cool nights!"}
{"text":"It was worth the wait!

Our reservation was at 9:30PM, we arrived at the restaurant around 9pm. We were seated immediately. I'm assuming it was because our table was at 9:30pm, the server did not really take our order until 9:30ish. despite all that....

we order the following things, and I personally think that it's must try items:

Seared Foie Gras w/ Egg, bacon, maple: It was so amazing, to the point where I keep scraping the plate to get the \"sauce\" which was an infused maple syrup w/ bacon fat. 

Lobster Spaghetti: No further explanation needed since it was so damn good....I would recommend to share this with someone because it's so rich and delicious.

Liverpool Steak: big fat juicy seared really good steak, the only minor thing was it was a little to salty for my taste. Other than that, it's all good.

When you're in montreal....give this place a try and make sure to make reservation ahead of time...It's a popular restaurant..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food all round. Not too crowded for 7pm on a Saturday, we arrived with good timing to look at the chalkboard menu before anyone sat down at the table in front of it. The timing of the service was very well paced. Waiters were not snooty about speaking english. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  My husband and I started with the duck sausage and horse tartare which were both delicious.  We both ordered the quail for the main course, again, it did not disappoint.  Our trip was a few weeks ago so I don't recall our choice of dessert but I remember thinking the choice was a good one!  This restaurant is not cheap but if you are going to go, I highly recommend doing it big to get the whole experience.  We will definitely be recommending this restaurant to fellow travelers in the future."}
{"text":"Liverpool was one of the highlights of our trip. We actually even debated coming back for a second dinner here before our vacation ended, just for the lobster ravioli! 

I don't really need to go into the whole thing with Anthony Bourdain and the owners of Liverpool House, which provided the basis for our decision to come here. My sister and I decided that we should do at least one nice, expensive dinner in Montreal/Quebec City, and this was it. Reservations were easy to make, even a week ahead- we set one for 6PM on a Tuesday. It was a little confusing because we did arrive a little early and although the Yelp indicates that they open at 5PM, our walk-by made us think they didn't open until later. Weird. 

Either way, we entered right at 6PM and were the first ones there, and got our choice of tables. We chose one right by the window, which provided us delightful natural lighting and the illusion of more space- as other reviews have stated, the space between tables is very small. As it was, we got an earful of our one side of neighbors' conversations (which I won't get into but wow, it was a mess)- I can't imagine being sandwiched by two tables with equally loud conversations!

Although we came under the impression that they only had the chalkboard for their entire menus, they did have actual menus for us to peruse. The chalkboards held the specials, which were also described to us by our waitress. Ultimately, we chose and ate:

Foie Gras with Concord Grapes: Pretty simple dish. Foie gras was good. I'm not sure I liked the pairing with the Concord grapes and bread, which I think overpowered the taste of the Foie Gras. Meh. 

Corn with Cheese Curds and Truffle: Surprisingly, this was one of the few dishes (if only?) that had truffle shavings on it. This dish was sooo good- everything paired really well together. 

Half order of Lobster Spaghetti ($28): Not gonna lie, I still occasionally dream about this spaghetti and look at my picture of it. It was soooo good that if we had come back, I'm pretty sure we would have gotten a full order of it. Lobster itself wasn't as juicy/moist as expected, but good. Spaghetti was magnificent! Perfectly cooked and delicious!

Desserts were a little bit disappointing. There was just not enough contrast in textures and temperatures, imo. 

Profiteroles: I had imagined the chocolate ganache to be a bit warmer to contrast with the ice cream, but it wasn't. Didn't wow me. 

Apple Pie: Same deal- are we just too used as Americans to have warm apple pie with ice cream? This was room temperature apple pie. Not our favorite. 

Overall, still an excellent experience other than our can't-help-bc-we're-so-close eavesdropping, and the desserts. The place also got a lot busier as the night went by so the service was noticeably slower too. Solid 4/5 stars, especially for that corn & lobster spaghetti."}
{"text":"Even though the famous Joe Beef has a long waiting list for reservations, the sister restaurant Liverpool House is relatively easy to get a reservation for. And most importantly, the food is quite solid there. Expect quality delicious comfort food that fills your belly without being overwhelmingly heavy. Definitely give this place a try!

Pictured: Snow crab appetizer; Guinea Fowl with oyster mushrooms and ramps in Alexander sauce."}
{"text":"I had been here in November with a girlfriend of mine. The service was very welcoming at the beginning. But I kept feeling pressured by our waiter to buy wine as well as dessert. 

The oysters were tasty but not shucked properly. My fish plate which was the fish of the day was too buttery. And our dessert was hard. My friends ordered the halibut and that was very good. I hate the fact that the menu is written all over the walls (including wine) difficult to read since it is very dim."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Awesome food and fantastic service! I really enjoyed the Horse Steak! I think it was the best steak I ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Do NOT judge a book by its cover! I had serious reservations when I first walked in thinking this was some rinky dink hole in the wall but I have been proven wrong! After walking in and through a few curtains we were escorted to an intimate outdoor oasis. We had reservations for 7pm so we were treated to a beautiful sunset along with our dinner. The wait staff was friendly but the star of this show is the FOOD. From the chimichurri sauce for the hanger steak to the rotisserie chicken we just did not want our food to end. Ultimately we requested a visit from the head chef in order to give him a standing ovation by way of thank you. I will definitely come again on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Can't say I love this restaurant. They don't print menus and only have one chalkboard. The fact you have to get up to look at the menu on the wall is taking the piss. I'll crane my neck gladly, but walk over and hover over another table of diners to gawk and attempt to memorize is just rude and uncouth. 

The food, however is very, very good. In your face, unforgiving, and absolutely delicious. Too bad the service was a bit indifferent and laced with attitude.

All in all one of those places that is far from a great restaurant, but worth a visit for the food alone...if you can remember what's on the blackboard."}
{"text":"Had been looking forward to trying this place out for a while. Decided to be adventurous with our waiter and asked him to surprise us with our menu options. The appetizers that he ordered were fresh and fun to eat. The main course on the other hand were 2x pasta dishes . The pasta dishes were both awful. What seemed to be the owner offered to change our plates but actually never did. One of the pasta bowls was left untouched and the other the person with the dietary issues eat the pasta bowl with dairy because no one came back to change our order ( we were sitting at the bar). Once the bill came through they didn't even have a care in the world to take it off the bill. The menu is short and sweet and normally I'm good with that but this time around I say this place is a AVOID . Way to expensive for the experience you get ."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere at this rustic eatery. It's not fine dining but the food is excellent especially the desserts."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Was expecting some fancy operation but instead was met with an unassuming professional restaurant. Food was very good. Waiter and somelier were well informed and efficient. Had the 120$ rib which was delicious. The gnocchi were ok. The burgundy ham was great too. Would return."}
{"text":"Great place. Food was amazing. I got the calamari stuffed with rice pilaf and the lobster spaghetti which was out of this world.  This was my first time to Montreal and this place was recommended by someone I met and they did not disappoint. Atmosphere is fantastic. Chris is awesome behind the bar."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Came for my bachelor party on a Friday night and... the atmosphere was lively, our server handled the group very well, and the food and drinks were top notch. I had the liverpool steak, which was super delicious, and definitely way more food than I needed, but I ate it anyway. A few of my friends had a rabbit dish which they loved, and those that had the lobster pasta said it might have been the best meal of their life. So there's that. I give it a big thumbs up"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I started with the Bloody Caesar. It was so flavourful and had just the right amount of spice. It was garnished with one oyster, a celery, a pickle and an olive and the glass was rimmed with steak spice. We then had a glass of wine followed by another cocktail. The waitress was very generous when she poured the wine! 

We started with the deer tartare. I love tartare and this one was delicious. It did not taste gamey at all. It was fresh and had crunchy deep fried onions on top. 

The last time I went to Liverpool house I tried the foie gras breakfast sandwich. Think McDonald's breakfast but with foie gras!! I liked it but didn't order it this time because my boyfriend doesn't love foie gras like I do. 

For mains we shared the lobster spaghetti of course. If you are expecting a regular tomato based spaghetti you will be disappointed but I assure you this white creamy lobster spaghetti is a must! It was as amazing as I remembered. My boyfriend doesn't like spaghetti but he loved this one. I feel like the first time I had this dish at the restaurant there was more lobster in the pasta compared to this time but I think I still had about two pieces. The bacon in the pasta really adds flavour. 

We also shared the hangar steak with blue cheese. If you don't like blue cheese stay away but I enjoy blue cheese on my steak. I admit some pieces of steak were better than others but I guess that's to be expected. 

We didn't order dessert because we were too full. The portions are good and everything is delicious! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"What a WONDERFUL dining experience. When I was making plans to visit my sister in Montreal, she said that we should dine at Joe Beef (the sister restaurant). I tried making reservations and couldn't get one! So the next best thing was to try and get a reservation here, which I was able to get thankfully.

Liverpool House is small, intimate, and their menu is all on a chalkboard. Sounds like an order at the counter and sit and wait for your number to be called type of restaurant, right? Well, it certainly was not. Our server was the sweetest (and cutest) guy who was so accommodating and read off everything on the chalkboard for us. We ordered a bottle of wine (a VERY impressive list that covered about two blackboards in itself!), ordered the bleu cheese chicken wings and lobster spaghetti. Oh man. The food... just incredible. The wings were unlike any kind of wings I've ever tasted. The endive leaves that accompanied it with the bleu cheese sauce was incredible. The lobster spaghetti had flavors that had so much depth... I could've kept eating it and eating it until my own gluttony consumed my foodie soul.

Prices are steep but the portions are very generous. Even our server recommended that some entrees were appropriate for splitting. If you find yourself in Montreal, I highly recommend getting a reservation here (or even Joe Beef, as the menu is very similar I was told). Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Canada."}
{"text":"From the food to the service to the wine to the coziness, the only thing I have to say is I love love love this place. I've sent so many people to eat here and all I ever hear back from my friends is love love love love love love love and \"thanks for telling me\" and \"now I have to try Joe Beef too.\"

All I can say is my stomach is basically in a sordid polyamorous love affair with Joe Beef, Liverpool House and Vin Papillon. \"Ménage à trois\" indeed. TMI, I know (and now you know too). 

p.s. Book early."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I walked into Liverpool House and was quickly greeted by their staff. He was very friendly and pleasant. He took his time in explaining every single dish on their menu on the chalkboard. We ordered:

Homemade Lamb Sausage - It was the best lamb sausages we've ever had so far. It was flavourful and juicy.

Liverpool Steak (16oz) - a MUST order to share if you can't finish the whole 16oz. I had it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and it melted in your mouth and well seasoned. It was so good that I finished the 16oz all by myself!

Lobster Spaghetti (1.5lb) - A generous portion of lobster with shells with al dente spaghetti. It had a nice cream sauce, but my fiancé wished it was less saucy, otherwise perfect.

I will definitely be back next time!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but I felt like they threw a stick of butter in my lobster pasta. It was satisfying the first few bites, but then it became too much. However, I loved the foie gras burger, the sweetness of the maple syrup mixed with the foie gras was delightful. The service was great and I'd say that I don't regret eating here at all."}
{"text":"C'est en fin de soirée et sur recommandation que je suis allée au Liverpool House. L'endroit est cosy. Le mur du fond, recouvert d'ardoise, fait office d'une immense carte des vins. Tout de suite un bon point pour l'amatrice que je suis. On regrettera cependant le choix assez basique et plus que limité de vins au verre. C'est donc sur une bouteille que mon ami et moi nous retranchons ; et elle était bonne, le poulet de mon ami aussi, par contre le foie-gras... certainement pas ! Pas assez cuit, il \"glissait\" dans la bouche à tel point que je n'ai pas pu le finir au risque de tout rendre sur place. Vu le prix, c'est un peu fort de café !

Si j'y retourne ? Difficile à dire."}
{"text":"An excellent meal! My husband had the horse appetizer and the rabbit entrée, both of which were delicious. I had the squash blossom with the beer cheese appetizer and the duck for an entrée, the duck was well cooked, but I regret not getting the lobster pasta, which the couple next to us had and said was delicious. The restaurant itself is small, so we were sitting very close to the couple next to us. But it ended up working out very well as we had a wonderful conversation with them and generally enjoyed ourselves. The staff is very attentive and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. The decor is cool, menu good and service was excellent, food was ok at best. Pretty typical of a restaurant that is now part of the Joe Beef marketing beast. Found everything to be very salty (and i love salt) and nothing above average. 
I think the most annoying thing is you are 6 inches apart from the table beside you, so close that we are part of their conversation.
It is one of those places that people rant about because they feel they have to ."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with a friend and was very impressed with the food, service and general ambiance.
If you watch Anthony Bourdain religiously and are a Bourdain groupie and you're having a hard time getting reservations at Joe Beef, Liverpool House will do just fine given it's own by the same dynamic duo of Fred and Dave (along with wine bar Vin Papillon).
The Lobster Spaghetti and the steaks and oysters seem to be constants at both establishments but having had the Lobster Spaghetti already, buddy and I opted for the Rib Steak for two. 
I had the Razor Clams with lobster mayo as a started and buddy had the smoked meat coquettes. They made a mistake with my order and I got the clams but they recognized it and the said it was on them and gave me the Razor Clams on the house which I thought was very generous of them. The clams came in a veggie broth with stewed veggies and this insane slice of garlic and parsley bread. Seriously, I could eat that bread all night. My friend enjoyed the coquettes immensely.The Razor Clams came in their shell with the lobster mayo garnished with garlic chips. It was amazing.
Then came the Rib steak for two. We ordered it medium-rare but it was more rare if you ask me, in it's own juices. It came with a side dish of Bubble and Squeak, a mish-mash of potatoes, meat and veggies mixed up together. Seriously, this was a HUGE piece of meat but buddy and I managed to eat up most of it. 
We both wanted to keep some room left for dessert. What was leftover of the steak and Bubble and Squeak, we were able to take home so we could enjoy dessert. With classic stand-bys like Chocolate Pot au Creme, Cheesecake, you can't go wrong. My friend ordered the classic Australian dessert, the Grapefruit Pavlova (meringue) and I had the Chocolate Pot au Creme. We shared and both were fantastic. The pavlova is the perfect dessert if you want something light.
i think the only thing which took away from the experience was the noise level. Gosh it got loud and I could barely hear my friend over the table. I understand the whole Joe Beef/Liverpool House ethos and vibe, casual, shabby chic with very high end food and wine but if I want to enjoy a wonderful dinner with a friend, I'd like to be able to talk to them and hear them without each of us raising our voices to be heard so for that, I have to take a star off.
Nonetheless, if they can somehow fine-tune the noise level, it's still an awesome restaurant to go to with wonderful food, drink and service."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant! The food was absolutely phenomenal. I would highly recommend the lobster fettuccine and the breaded cauliflower appetizer. Apparently the Brussels sprouts are a restaurant signature dish, but they weren't in season when we came. Service was also great - the main waitress seemed to have lots of help, so someone was always coming to refill drinks, offer food, or clean up. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I think I found my favourite brunch food!! Can I have Crepes au Foie Gras ($22) every weekend? The foie gras wrapped in bacon inside my crepe and finished off with maple syrup!

Liverpool House was definitely my best dining experience during my weekend in Montreal. The service here is excellent, our waitress was so kind in going through every single item on the menu with us in English.... including how each dish is prepared and ingredients used! She did make everything sounded delicious....

We ended up ordering and sharing:

Entrees: Crepes au Foie Gras ($22) & Pieuxre Mauritius & Pakoras ($18) 
- love both dishes: both interesting as the foie gras has all the traditional element vs the pakoras is kind of a fusion dish..

Plats: Spaghetti Homard - Lobster ($49)
- A little disappointing, though the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was complimenting the seafood but the lobster has this mushy texture 

Dessert: Merveilleux Aux Marrons ($9)
- hot dark chocolate poured on top of marrons cake... crunchy and sweet Vs hot and bitter... what a happy ending! :)

I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu... In fact I have already booked a reservation at Liverpool House for my next weekend in Montreal!

And for the time being, I just dream about the foie gras............so buttery..........stuffed full of it..."}
{"text":"Sweet, Enola Gay

  I've had the pleasure of dining here twice in recent past and by all means, Liverpool house has set the bar for some of the most amazing food and drink I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.

  My first go round was a 9 o'clock table, mid week. We were seated immediately and started with a Tom Collins. I'm not usually a gin drinker, as I have seen some of the most manly men I know, reduced to tears by gin but when it is on the chalkboard...why not? A mean, Tom Collins was the general consensus.

  Then the Onslaught of pork began. We started with pulled pork cigars. Succulent, smokey, pulled pork with the right amount of bark, wrapped in garden fresh, Boston lettuce and tied together with a chive. Awesome.

 Next up, deconstructed(kinda)BLT. Not overly pretentious, it was more of a self serve BLT. Boston Lettuce, garden fresh tomato, house bacon, mayo, stack of crostinies and a peck of steak tartar. Decadent.

 Then the Pork chop came. Despite societies nonacceptance of the word, the only mot juste that comes to mind is...retarded. A house snausage, marrow bones and a big hunk of pig, cooked to perfection, smothered in a veal stocky, barbequish type sauce, that, when I ran a piece of cop through, split like the red sea, held like divine intervention and then slowly resumed its original form.  Really decadent.


  Second time 'round

  9 o'clock again. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of getting to know Thomas, a great bar keep and all around nice guy. He served up a couple Kentucky...um...somethingorothers...they had chartreuse in them. Ask Tom, he'll know.

  Then the seafood onslaught began. Half a dozen fresh, perfectly shucked, plump oyster, wading in their liquor, to start. Served with mignonette and cocktail sauces. Tasted like the ocean.

  Next up, crisp asperge with fork tender, smoked swordfish and a foie gras cream.
The swordfish was the best fish I have ever tasted. It fell apart as I rolled it in my mouth with my tongue while the smokey flavour encompassed my palate, complimented by the crunch of the asparagus and then the smooth flavour and texture of the cream. Not too much but just enough. Therapeutic.

  Finally, a salt crusted arctic char, along with enough clams to choke a donkey and salsa Verde and hollandaise on the side. This was the second best fish I have ever had. Juicy, flavourful, stuffed with herbs and when doused in the hollandaise, forgetta 'bout it. Delicious.

  To conclude, Go.

Waka Waka."}
{"text":"I've never been to joe beef but I am a fan of this spot. The waitress was attentative and hilarious, I wish I had gotten her name so I could call her out.

The food was good. I split the patte which came out like a slice of pie with 3 sauces, a slice of bread, and ap ickle. It was delicious. All of it.

I split the New Guinea Fowl with foie gras for two. The bird was cooked perfectly with execellently crispy skin. The piece of liver on top was rich and delicious. I wouldve rubbed it all over me and bathed in it if I could."}
{"text":"As the sister restaurant to Joe Beef this was a massive disappointment.  The chef suffered from bad technique and lack of imagination.  We ordered the chili and tripe and the meat was noticeably overcooked to the point of tasting burnt.  Two dishes with Rabbit were littered with bone fragments and way overcooked. All of the dishes were bland--even by British standards."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Montreal this was one of my MOST awaited meals here. We arrived nice and early at 5PM to our reservation. There were a couple other groups already seated. From the time we were seated it took nearly 20 minutes before ANYONE came to read the specials, give us water, etc. It's as if they completely forgot about us which is bizarre because they were seating additional tables and reading the specials to people all around us. Having been to numerous high end restaurants before I was awe-struck. Finally I had to say something and a waiter came to address us. 

Despite the poor service I was determined to try the food so we ordered a bunch of dishes: the tartare, foie gras, oysters, lobster spaghetti, and chicken confit. The tartar and lobster spaghetti were amazing. The cream sauce was very good with a mix of creaminess and brine from the lobster. Foie gras was good but wasn't too impressed by the relish accompaniment and bun. The confit kind of fell flat. It was an impressive amount of food however I felt like the quality of food was a bit lacking and didn't live up to the hype. The combination of poor service and mid-level food I'm not sure I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"What can I say about this amazing restaurant?  It's just that good.  It really is.  So go with a group of friends...get EVERYTHING on the menu...relax and enjoy!  Do yourself a favor and whatever desserts there are...get them!"}
{"text":"Food was great, waitress was horrifically rude. Must be the worst waitress ever! Tip? None!"}
{"text":"Je dois avouer que Liverpool House a été un deuxième choix, car originalement, c'est au Joe Beef que je voulais aller. Une fois que j'ai réalisé qu'il faut réserver au moins un mois en avance pour Joe Beef, mais que juste à côté il y a ce joli petit resto, créer des mêmes personnes, je me suis dis que ça valait la peine d'essayer. Le résultat a été super et je suis heureuse d'y être allée au lieu.

On a essayé d'un peu de tout. La salade de betteraves, l'entrée de calmars farcis de homard, les pétoncles grillés, les côtes levées, le brownie et les beignets à l'érable. Tout était simplement dé-li-cieux! La cuisson était parfaite, les portions généreuses sans être gigantesque, et les saveurs....oh....les saveurs....j'y rêve encore! En plus, le service est l'un des meilleurs que j'ai vu. Pour notre vin, la serveuse nous a même emmenée des bouteilles pour goûter selon ce qu'on a commandé et nos préférences afin que l'on puisse choisir le bon verre. Je n'ai jamais vu ça ailleurs, et c'est  une touche spéciale simple mais extrêmement efficace pour gagner une place spéciale dans mon cur."}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional. The servers were knowledgeable and attentive. Best dining experience I've had all year! FYI- when they have scallops on the menu, get them!!"}

Service: excellent service
Dishes: Terrine De Fois Gras; Spaghetti Homard Lobster

This place is very cosy. Since we didn't have reservations, we went for a seat at the bar so we can eat sooner. We're on a schedule. But the service was excellent & accommodating.

-Terrine De Fois Gras (3*). So we tend to enjoy our fois when done right. Although good this style terrine isn't something we're into. It leans towards the more stiff style paste & we like our fois more melt in your mouth. This is for more acquired tastes since the liver taste is much stronger. It's also a large portion. Which we could only eat a certain amount until the strong liver taste started getting to us. The few first bites were fine though.
-Spaghetti Homard Lobster (4*). Delicious dish. My wife liked it much more than I did. The spaghetti was coated in this buttery, slightly cheesy sauce, which wasn't overpowering, it was subtle but flavorful. With chunks of lobster sprinkled in."}
{"text":"Came here with my other half last night expecting it to be not quite as fab as Joe Beef, but still great and honestly, we left a little disappointed. The service and ambiance were fantastic and I love the decor, but everything we ate was far too salty. The starter salad arrived and looked gorgeous: a lovely piece of toasted brioche on top of a soufflé full of cheese, surrounded by tomatoes on top of kale: it would have been perfect if the kale hadn't of tasted like a mouthful of ocean :( In vain, we tried to cut down the salt with the bread and even that didn't work. Still, the tomatoes were incredible as was the brioche and soufflé. For my main, I had the dorade, it was stuffed with shrimp which tasted like overkill to me and took away from the freshness of the fish; the clams that surrounded it though were quite tasty. Dessert wasn't anything too special: meringue and ice cream. 

I will absolutely come back here for late night small bites, yummy beer and great wine, but for dinner, I'd rather go next door  to Joe Beef."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to give give review of 5 stars or 1 star, but this place deserves it.

I made a reservation for 1 at 6:30 PM.  I decided to go here instead of Joe Beef, since it's a bit less well known by the tourists.  I am so glad I went here.

I walked in and was greeted by the host.  She explains to me that the menu and wine list is written on the chalkboard.  One of the server/bartender noticed that I was responding in English.  He walks over to me and asked me how my French was.  To which I responded with, \"terrible\".  He gladly went through the entire menu and explained everything to me in English.

The menu changes frequently, but there are a few items that are regular on the menu.  I opted for one of the special over the lobster pasta dish.  I was told that the lobster is a staple there and it will be on the menu for long a time.  I got the duck breast.  Being from California, I had to get the foie gras to start.  I also got half dozen oysters.  I got a mix of Canadian oysters.  I am was happy I did.  This place is serious about their oysters.  I also got 3 drinks.  I started with a refreshing pre-dinner drink.  The server suggested a red wine to go with the duck breast.  I finished the night with the bloody ceasar as my dessert.

Throughout the night, they talked to me.  Even the owner came and joined in on the conversation.  It felt like a great neighborhood restaurant even if you're not from the neighborhood.

As an added bonus, I got a great recommendation for dinner for the next night."}
{"text":"Reservations are a must at this place and even then be prepared to wait. Even with 9:30pm reservations we weren't seated until about 10pm. The host did provide us with drinks while we waited which is a nice way to bide our time. Why the 5 stars still? Because the food and service were still damn good. Plus, while waiting for our table I was able to read over the chalkboard menu in the main dining room. 

The food was amazing and the staff were very attentive and helpful. Started with a parfait of fois gras and deep fried Brussels sprouts as appetizers. The sprouts are tossed in a vinaigrette which really brightens up their nutty flavor. The fois gras was served in a small mason jar and served with triangles of bread. 

The stars of the evening were the entrees. Not sure if they're meant to be eaten 'family style' but the portions lend themselves to sharing with your table. We ended up getting the spaghetti lobster and sirloin steak - surf and turf! These apparently are permanent fixtures on their rotating menu and I can see why. If you only plan to visit this fine establishment once in your life, do yourself a favor and get the spaghetti lobster. If that was the only dish I tried that evening there then I honestly would have left completely satisfied. As soon as the dish hit the table we were hit with the aroma of lobster and butter. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. If I could, I would've licked the plate clean to get all that delicious sauce. The steak was cooked exactly to medium and the kitchen sliced it for us to make it much easier to share. They also sent out a side of lentils with roasted squash on the house to accompany our other dishes.

The final tab for dinner for two with drinks but without desserts because we were completely stuffed from dinner, came out to a little over $100/person. The place is loud, cramped and tiny, but all totally worth it if you're looking to have an amazing dinner. Be aware they do not accept Amex."}
{"text":"Not worth the price, for the same range go to joe beef even though they the  same owners. Menu items where good, but not unique"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. The service was impeccable at the bar. I was in and out of there in forty minutes. The bartender also recommended an excellent red wine. 

I went with the fresh pasta with fresh razor clams. I had never had razor clams before and figured this would be the place to do so. Omg, so good. I could eat that every night. 

It seems like the menu changes frequently, but you can be confident whatever you order is going to be great. The guy next to me had the foie Gras breakfast sandwich and it looked huge and amazing. Best restaurant I've been to in Montreal and I have been coming about twice a year for three years."}
{"text":"There are certain restaurants that just speak to us. Everything, from the decor to the ambience to the music and of course the food, works within your sensibilities and creates a space that would go gladly go back to day after day if you could because it just feels right. Fred Morin and Dave McMillan created just such a place for me with Joe Beef. Since my original visit there last year (and further reinforced by my recent meal there this summer), I have always had their second restaurant (and neighbour a few doors down) Liverpool House on my \"Must Check Out\" list. Well, I finally got the chance with the family to see if the Morin and McMillan spell on me would continue.

With our 9:30 reservation and the dim lighting, there wasn't really the chance to take some interior pictures (and impacted the quality of my other pictures as well) but Liverpool House continues the casual and off-beat look that Joe Beef has in spades. Beautiful bar to enjoy a drink while a Steven Segal movie plays on a mini TV, wood panelled walls with large chalkboard menus, leather banquets and wood tables, a canoe on the ceiling, a mounted deer on the wall and way too many paintings of 18 wheelers. I simply cannot do it justice without images. All to say, I love it and the vibe it sets for the meal. Add some great alternative music and you've got me hook, line and sinker.

Before we even discuss the food, we must start with the cocktails. Liverpool House has a few house cocktails and I got to try 2 over the course of the evening. First, the Old Pal - basically their twist on a Negroni. A very bitter cocktail but one that I enjoyed tremendously. The second one was called a St-Vincent Sour - their play on a Whiskey sour but using Bourbon and maple syrup instead. Love the overall balance of this cocktail - very smooth with a slight touch of sweet and no bitterness. Complete 180 to the Old Pal in every sense. I definitely will be playing with that combination of ingredients at home shortly.

As a appetizer, I went with their \"Beer Cheese\" dish - a mixture of blue cheese, cream cheese and goat cheese with some beer and other spices which becomes a spread served with marinated vegetables and some grilled toast. A very solid cheese blend that balances itself quite nicely. The cream and goat cheeses lent a nice smooth creamy texture while the blue cheese added a bit of kick but not enough to overwhelm the other elements of the spread. The marinated vegetables added a little vinegar to the party and the deliciously toasted bread served as the perfect platter for all of this. A great appetizer.

On to the main. I decided to go for the veal sweetbreads with a mix of onions and Romesco sauce. Served on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and some jus, this dish will make anyone who has issues with sweetbreads love them. Nice and crispy on the outside with a perfect soft and fluffy texture inside, the sweetbreads were cooked to perfection to truly showcase the natural fattyness they hold. The mixture of onions added some nice sweetness to the dish and the Romesco sauce (a Spanish nut and red pepper-based sauce for the un-initiated as I was that night) provided a little garlic kick and as well as a little sweet spiciness. This dish was returned completely picked clean - loved every inch of it.

There was one other main course I tried as there was some leftovers at the table and that was the curry shrimps.  The reason for some being left over is quite simple - the portion they serve is huge. Over a dozen large shrimp served in a curry mixture with spicy lentils, pilaf rice and a yogourt sauce. The sauce for the shrimp was nice and mild in terms of curry. I cannot say the same for the lentils - a little too much heat for my tastes, especially the after-taste. Thankfully the deliciously creamy yogourt sauce cooled my palette off quickly. Add a solid rice pilaf and you have a solid dish through and through.

Finally we get to dessert. I went for the Apricot Financiers. Mini light and fluffy almond flour-based cakes with a hazelnut crust served with some cherries, apricots and house-made vanilla ice cream. Wonderfully executed dessert all around. I was a big fan in particular of the ice cream. Just a great depth of vanilla flavour on top of a velvety texture. A great end to a awesome meal.

In the end, Liverpool House had me from the moment I walked in and never let go. The entire experience was wonderful and simply made wish I could come back more often (and believe me... if it weren't for budgetary notions, I would be there and at Joe Beef pretty much monthly). If you have been to Joe Beef and enjoyed it, then you need to check out Liverpool House. If you haven't been, then no worries. Just come down anyway and I am sure you will convert quite quickly. Now to go save more money to visit again soon....

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was determined to get me and my husband here on our honeymoon. As an epicurean who is also obsessed with vintage and antique everything (don't come into my tiny apartment unless you're prepared to redefine the word hoarder), I wanted to stuff ourselves off vintage china and flatware and that we did. We stuffed ourselves to the gills with wine and lobster pasta and clams casino. Also, the most memorable dessert I have had, hands down: warm financier pear tart with frangipane. This financier was baked in a tart pan, nutty brown delicious, with a half a pear baked into it. I'd do anything for this recipe. Came with a cup of pear sorbet that was basically biting directly into the ripest pear of the season. So clean, so fresh. 

Liverpool House is the equivalent to a fine whisky/whiskey/scotch; warm, brown and glowing. I love that it's so warm and inviting inside while it's biting cold outside. Makes me feel like I'm in a cabin. Staff is incredibly welcoming. But, it's straight forward; if you order clams casino...you'll get exactly that. Not an ethnic rendition, not a fucking deconstructed version...just clams casino. And that's what I ordered. That's what I want.

Moments of awkwardness: How is a place that was opened by a large man (Dave McMillan) not large or spacious enough to fit a large woman?! Dude, this space is so small and tight (cozy and intimate) that I could barely squeeze my fat arse in between other tables and chairs when I left.

Standing in the corner with hoards of other people to stare at a chalkboard menu in the dark. Hella hard to decipher, hard to not feel pressure to make a split decision and again...stuck in the corner with a crowd of other people also trying to decipher menu.

And still...I love it."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday. Food and service were excellent. The lobster spaghetti was a highlight."}
{"text":"Excellents produits, carte très classique, portions généreuses. Bon service. Parfois un peu cher. Les spaghettis au homard sont de très très très loin mon plat préféré là bas, tellement bons"}
{"text":"I like Liverpool House (LH) but, in my opinion, their stuff is quite hit-or-miss. One Fact: The food there is heavy (this is not a criticism in any way - but one should be aware of this before going there!!!).

My go-to dish at LH is their \"Cote de Boeuf\" special. It is meant for sharing: enough quantity for 2-3 people and it includes some seasonal sides (cost: $110). I like it so much that, usually, I only go to LH when I can ascertain that my dining group will want to order this. It's always GREAT!!! If I just consider this... 4.5 stars.

More generally, they do their \"meats\" quite well (including seafood). The other dish components and items are a mixed bag. For instance, at my latest visit, scallops w/ risotto were ordered. The scallops were excellent (!!!) but the risotto was bad (thin rice, watery, underseasoned). This is just one of several examples I've experienced over the last couple of years here.

Odd Fact: They charge for their bread and butter ($2.50 for 3 or 4 slices of bread and one pickle). I guess that's fine - but I can imagine that this would annoy some folks because it's not particularly special bread.

The restaurant itself looks stylish and has a unique charm (they have a canoe hanghing from the ceiling... and it stylistically works!). I'm less favorable about the service. It isn't terrible but it is definitely well below average."}
{"text":"Preparing for our trip to Montreal, we did the typical research: foodie TV shows, travel articles and, of course, Yelp. And in all of our studying, two names kept coming up: Frédéric Morin and David McMillan. 

So by the time we arrived, it's fair to say that their restaurants, Joe Beef and Liverpool House, were on our must-try lists and that we had some lofty expectations. 

Well, Liverpool House met those expectations and exceeded them, perhaps more so than any other restaurant ever has. For the first time, I truly wish there was a sixth star I could give a business. It was superb not only in food but also in service.

I'll start with the service. My boyfriend and I had heard that both restaurants are tough to get into without reservations well in advance. Deciding to try our luck, we called ahead and were told that there weren't any spots available but we could show up and perhaps luck into a cancelation. 

So we did, and we did! The host was very gracious, and asked if we would be able to give up the table in an hour and a half for a later reservation. At the time, I thought an hour and half seemed like more than enough time to eat in this dark, sexy restaurant, but in all honesty, we could have stayed there for much longer. 

We were shown to our table, which as other reviewers have mentioned, was in close quarters to other diners. And our server (who we found out later is also one of the managers) was patient enough to go over the menu with us. 

The menu is written on a large chalkboard, in French. Considering our table was not near that area of the restaurant nor do we know French, it was great to have a guide. 

And he first guided us to the pig tails, a pork version of buffalo chicken wings. Yes, these were really pig tails, but the tails had been cut up in inch or so sections. These had a bit of a kick to them and were served with a Ranch-like dressing. They also had small bones in them, which our server/the manager warned us about. Definitely a high-end take on pub grub. 

And then for my entree, I got the much written about lobster spaghetti. Oh, the lobster spaghetti. One of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Instead of little bits of lobster mixed into the pasta, like you might see elsewhere, an entire lobster was presented in this spaghetti -- claws, tail and all. And boy did it hit the spot. Liverpool House used thicker spaghetti, which held on to more of the savory sauce. The serving size was also large, but I did not have any trouble finishing it off. This is last-meal material.

We shared the Brussels sprouts -- another revelation. These were served in a sweet vinegar sauce, which brought something new to this trendy dish. I have tried to find a recipe for these online but am so far unsuccessful.

My boyfriend got the trout, which was served whole with mushroom and cabbage stuffed inside. At any other restaurant, this would easily be the star, but next to these other dishes, it definitely played back-up singer. 

And then for dessert, we got the cheese plate, so that we could enjoy some more raw-milk cheese while in Canada. The server/manager recommended this cheese plate as well as a port-like Banyuls wine pairing. Just wow. The plate was served with warm, soft, thick, buttery, toasted bread, which was great for spreading cheese. The server/manager suggested a few types of cheeses as well as the spoonful of local honey. Now this is what a cheese plate should be. 

And the wine. We are trying desperately to find a way to get it in the states. It was sweet and warmed us up on that cold night. 

Throughout the meal, our cups never came close to empty, and our food came out fast. I loved the casual soundtrack that played while we dined, which included Blues Traveler, Justin Timberlake and other '90s and '00s hits. You could tell that while this restaurant takes its food seriously, it doesn't have a big ego about it. 

Plus the servers and staff seemed to genuinely enjoy working there. We watched other servers take care of the tables around us, and they all seemed happy to answer questions and full of pride and smiles. They also seemed to get along well with each other, helping each other out when needed. 

This was just such a fun place to be. 

And then when we left, the host had remembered us and made sure that we were able to enjoy everything, without feeling rushed to make it out before they needed the table for the 9 p.m. reservation. The restaurant was packed yet he kept track of everyone there. 

Great service and great food don't always go hand in hand. Liverpool House should be the standard other restaurants aspire to. I hope that I get to travel to Montreal again and enjoy this experience for a second time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in up and coming Griffintown, which is quickly becoming gentrified, a hospital is being built a few blocks over.  I made a reservation a few weeks in advance, which I would recommend, as it's a busy spot.  The menu is on a chalkboard so we had our server explain most of it to us.  We both had oysters to start and then the steak with red wine sauce, potatoes and greens.  The meal was simply delicious, I can't remember having a steak that good.  Service could have been better, but the food made up for it.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We finally made a reservation for Liverpool House, and I'm so glad we did! Their mozzarella appetizer and bread pudding dessert were the real stand outs for my group. I had never had mozzarella with currants before, and it the combination of those flavors along with pine nuts and broccolini was unexpected in the best way. The bread pudding was simply fantastic, the creme fraiche ice cream made the dish.

We also shared a special cabbage roll appetizer, which was rolled crab and sausage with a delicious (light) ginger sauce, and the lobster pasta special. The lobster pasta was good, and comes with more than enough lobster. If anything, I'd just recommend adding more sauce to that dish. The combo of more sauce with the already ample amount of lobster really would have made it perfect."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we had in Montreal. 

Before I delve into the food, let's talk abt the hood. Located in the newly gentrified section of St Henri, the street it's on boasts a number of quaint restaurants, trendy shops and hipster bars. 

Our reservation was at 6:45 and when we arrived there were still a good number of unfilled seats. The crowd consisted of businessmen expensing the meal, locals and tourists alike. We were lucky enough to get seated at a four top in front of the chalkboard menu--lucky for us since there are no printed menus, the lighting is dim and my husband forgot his glasses. If you're somewhat unfamiliar w French use Google Translate, or even better just ask the waitstaff. Our server was polite and uber helpful as we apologized profusely for not speaking the native tongue.

Undecisive, we went the tapas route (these are not tapas though, they're full-size). We started w a dozen PEI oysters, which were meticulously prepared and the freshest I've ever had. We also tried the beer cheese -- which I should've loved in theory bc I really enjoy each separately, but I just found it ok. The final app was the pork rilette, which I secretly didn't want to share.

We followed it up with 3 entrees; beef cheek, which was beautifully tender, seared scallops and the most popular dish on the menu, lobster spaghetti in a light cream sauce. Sounds pretty simple, but if it ain't broke... Us broads, ever up for something sweet opted for the chocolate mousse. I typically opt for vanilla or nutty desserts, but this rocked. Light and airy topped w fresh whip cream, I ate most of it."}
{"text":"We were very much looking forward to this meal, but the whole experience was underwhelming. Wine starts at about $50 CAD per bottle and goes up steeply from there, the 'low end' bottle we got wasn't anything special and yet was quite expensive. For food, I had the mushroom soup to start and the Arctic Char. The soup was lukewarm, and some of the mushrooms seemed beyond their peak. The fish was well cooked, but almost flavorless. Without dessert, we all paid about $90 CAD with tip. Wouldn't recommend."}
