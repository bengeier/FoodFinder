{"text":"Our family has been going to Pho VT for several years now and think it is a real gem.  We have had Vietnamese in many major cities in North America - Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Boston, New York, Chicago and Washington - and this the best we've had. The pho broth is clear, the meat is well-spiced, there are a lot of vegetables and they are fresh. The lemongrass chicken on rice is flavorful and just hot enough.  Our kids can't get enough of the sizzling beef with noodles. The curries and fish dishes are great too.  Each time we go, the dishes are served slightly differently, depending on what vegetables are freshest.  It is as close to \"homemade\" as possible."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, really.

This place is totally off the beaten path, and I only know about it because I work up here. Service is really, really good. Pho is ok, decent, and I've never had a disappointing meal. Cheap as hell."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the food was awesome! They added onions when we asked for none; but they QUICKLY made a new dish for us. Friendly and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Best Quail you can find in Toronto. Pho is alright but not the best in the city. Spring rolls are different than most Vietnamese places but still quite good. I seen someone else on Yelp complaining about Salad rolls at one of my other favorite Vietnamese restaurants. If you want some good salad rolls this place has them.

The staff are a family and make you feel like your part of it when you walk in the door. Some nights you'll go in and find them having a grand ol time watching movies or singing Karaoke.

Such a great restaurant. One of my first places I frequented when I moved to Toronto. Huey is great. You'll understand when you get there. 

Go there. Order the quail. Squeeze your lime into the little dish of salt and pepper they give you. Tear off a piece of quail meat (don't be afraid to get your fingers dirty) dip it in the salty lime mix and eat it. One of my favorite dishes among all foods. 

This place is off the map, took me forever to find a website that had it's details listed. The whole site was in Vietnamese."}
{"text":"This place is obviously family owned and their food shows it. 
I had a bowl of pho and their grilled pork +spring roll vermicelli.The pho was definitely not modernized(unlike pho88) and was delicious. The best part about the meal was the vermicelli though.This is where I fell in love with vermicelli.You won't regret ordering this dish.
I'm guessing this restaurant caters mostly to students and workers in the area.It was only half full last time I went for lunch on a Saturday.I just wish this place would open till late so I could grab a bowl of pho after a night of clubbing or drinking."}
{"text":"This place looked close from the outside... Stepping into Pho VT transfers me back in time.... The deco here is really really dated!! 70s? 

Kitchen is an open concept where I can see the 2 chefs busy cooking and frying and grilling. 

Grilled Beef with Spring Roll Bun ($7.99) with all the perfect garnishes: tons of basil leaves!! Refreshing and tasty best for a hot summer day. The beef was a little disappointing, not freshly grilled but reheated in the microwave. Size wise is really fulfilling and no complain about that! 

A lot of single female having lunch at Pho TV. Price wise is great as you can get a small pho for around $5.. great if you are on a diet, great portion and value control. 

There must be a lot of regulars here as the waiter greeted quite a few of them in Vietnamese while I was having my lunch here. 

Pho VT is a good choice if you looking for reasonable priced Vietnamese food around the area...but I won't be going out of my way to eat here!"}
