{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant ever. Literally everything I've tried tastes amazing. The wings are beyond delicious. I never order wings anywhere else because i know it'll never be as good as the wings at this restaurant. If you like spicy food... ask for bbq + hot mixed wings!!!"}
{"text":"Close to my workplace, love the food there, fast and convenient. It tastes so good especially the chicken shawarma, the phily cheese steak and the chicken tender, make sure you get the combo with seasoning fries and a pop. Perfect if you are close to Scarborough and want something that can make you full, cheap, and tasty."}
{"text":"I have returned to Nugget Pizza and Wings 5 times already. I have tried their pizza, poutine, wings, philly cheese steak. Everything 100%!! They have the greatest walk in deals and specials. It gets a little confusing when trying to place the order over the phone. Their kitchen is clean and I noticed they pay so much attention to detail when dressing the pizzas."}
