{"text":"Fresh, delicious ingredients makes for the perfect taco experience!  Very casual, service is excellent, prices are great.  Restaurant is very clean and organized.  Chicken tacos are my fav-low calorie-amazing!  Wonderful salsa bar too-gotta love those fermented onions, yes!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for some yummy street tacos. Simple menu, all you drink soda, and a salsa bar. 
Steal and Chicken cooked over Mesquite Charcoal. Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for a taco lunch.  We each had a couple  of tacos and it was all undercontrol$15  they have a delicious mequite flavor in the meat."}
{"text":"This is my second time (and last time) here. I tried for the first time at their grand opening. My first thought was - meh, I've had / can cook them better - But I decided to give them a try again and boy was I disappointed. There was so much gristle in my steak that I had to keep spitting it out in my napkin. Then I dug into the chicken which the first four bites were amazing until I started questioning one of the bites I was chewing. The texture was ODD. So I spit my food into my napkin (once again) and decided to see what I was chewing. It was RAW chicken. Come on! That's just gross!"}
{"text":"Staff were very nice.  Place was clean.  2 stars for that. 

We each had the 2 taco combo, 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, rice, beans and drink. $26. 

Wasn't disgusting, but I couldn't go so far as to say it was even ok. 
What was kind of disgusting was the \"guacamole\" that they squeeze out of a dispenser. Never seen anything like it, never want to again. 

One other really odd thing. Old time aluminium trash can that you have to pick the lid up off of to throw away your trash.  Pretty awkward with stuff in both hands. I'm sure they think it adds to the \"street\" vibe, but it's not very practical. 

I saw someone in another review say that they \"nailed the flavors\"?  I'm not sure what flavors that person is used to, but at this price point, try Urban Tacos for some actual flavor. As far as this flavor profile, let's just say that as we were walking to the car, my wife said, I can't wait to get home and brush my teeth. 

Hoping the next eatery to occupy this spot (guessing that won't be too far off) is better. In the meantime AZ Kabob next door is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Had one chicken taco, one steak taco. Very good, great to have a place in this part of town with real tacos! Non-stop while we were there. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mr Mesquite on Mayo Blvd and N Scottsdale Road in Scottsdale is by far the best place in Scottsdale to get your premium Burrito and Tacos. I strongly recommend the Steak Burrito with Sour Cream inside. This is likely the best Burrito I have ever had. The service is outstanding. The facility is immaculate. Very simple menu which makes it all the better. Taco Tuesday is the bargain with $2 tacos. Love this place. Ask for Roman as he provides Platinum Level customer Service."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Best tacos around. Everything is cooked slowly over mesquite charcoal. Don't hesitate to try this place out. And the prices are great for scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a place that sets itself apart from the rest. Well, Mr... Not so much. It's the usual take on Chipotle style minimalist menus. The meats were flavorful as they are cooked on open mesquite coals but I need more than that to get excited. The salsa bar lacks variety as there are two large containers of each item leaving only two salsas, a pico, cabbage, limes and cilantro to choose. Plenty enough room for more salsa varieties and maybe some grilled jalapenos and green onions? I was served their version of guacamole which was on the browning side and was blended to a mayonnaise consistency. 
Overall meal was meh."}
{"text":"Terrible and disgusting. As we waited for our food, a second employee began cooking more meat. He pulled the raw meat out of a tray right next to the cooked meat. He cut the bag open on the counter where the burritos are prepared, dripping blood from the raw meat as he lifted it over to the grill. He did not disinfect the area. In fact he didn't even wipe it down. Then when the first guy made our burrito, he put the foil down on the counter on top of the raw meat mess, contaminating our food. I will never eat here again. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"I have been desperate to find a local good taco restaurant, and by following the yelp reviews, I have now been successful.  Tacos (both chicken and steak) were fabulous with lots of meat, and a dollop of guacamole, and cheese.  We were in well after lunch time so we had time to visit with the staff who were very helpful and friendly with suggestions on what to order.  Definitely we wil return for delicious food, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great prices and awesome food. The lunch rush hour was quite busy but the service was well worth it. I will definitely be adding this place to one of my regular go to's for lunch. The steak tacos were delicious and the soft warm corn tortillas were perfect. If you're looking for some quick Mexican tacos, taqueria style, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The protein bowl with Carne Asada was excellent and a lot of food for the money. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Today was our third time at Mr Mesquite and it did not disappoint! The steak was amazing as usual. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!!  Perfectly cooked and fresh, super friendly staff and great flavors.  Terrific value as well!!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!! Rice is ridiculous...with tons of veg. A MUST try! People are super friendly and hard working. Love this place"}
{"text":"Best-kept secret around.  Not a place to eat inside, since they don't have much AC to speak of, but their meats are incredible, beans and guacamole are fantastic, and the protein bowls are highly recommended.  Carry out is fast...& advised.  LOL"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick light lunch!  Had a carnitas taco and a chicken taco.  Really good.  
If they had chips I would have been in heaven!"}
{"text":"These place serves the most authentic tacos and beans I've ever had in the Scottsdale area. Really tasty. Services was fast and even though the beans are extra have some, they are really good."}
{"text":"Best street tacos ever and fantastic customer service, always super nice employees overall great experience !!! 10/10"}
{"text":"Just stopped by this little place for lunch and loved it! We frequent this shopping center a lot and have tried almost all of the restaurants in here. In our opinion, the best food can be found in this little part of the shopping center. Between AZ Kabob's and Mr. Mesquite's, there is no need to go anywhere else. The tortillas were fresh and delicious, the steak had a nice mesquite flavor, all of the ingredients were fresh, and they had a salsa bar to top it off! The staff was friendly and everything was nice and clean. I imagine if they keep up with their quality ingredients and cleanliness they will be a very successful business!"}
{"text":"BUYERS BEWARE!!! took my girlfriend here for a nice lunch date. I had the quesadilla and she ordered the burrito. Everything was great until SHE LATER FOUND A SCREW IN HER FOOD! A literal screw. Luckily she noticed it before swallowing and was able to spit it out. HOW DOES A SCREW EVEN GET INTO A BURRITO!!! My girlfriend is too nice to leave a review so I'm doing it for her. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!! IMAGINE EATING A SCREW FOR LUNCH!!! Absolutely ridiculous"}
{"text":"Great little tacos and the horchata was very good not too sweet. Right next door to the movie theater"}
{"text":"Order from here and wow!! Been to the location in old town Scottsdale but love having more options from this location. Even with it delivered it was such great quality I will definitely be getting it again!M MUST get carne asada it's AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Mr Mesquite is a great place if you want some fast somewhat authentic tacos. We have been here a few times when we aren't feeling up to making dinner. The chicken has been dry a few times if we go late at night. I normally get two chicken tacos and rice and beans. Decently priced as well! I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"It's great being able to walk into a place and see them preparing food. The wait can be a little lengthy but certainly is worth it. I have ordered the protein bowl several times now and have never had a bad meal. These guys are also very polite and accommodating. I will keep going here

Great work guys!"}
{"text":"Great food - simple. Addicted to the pickled onions and I don't even really like onions"}
{"text":"First visit to Mr. Mesquite and I am so impressed! I ordered a chicken burrito (no cheese, no pickled onions) and I was surprised by how fresh and delicious the ingredients were. The burrito doesn't come with rice but I really didn't miss it. They also don't charge you extra for the guacamole that comes in the burrito which is always a plus!  I got served very quickly - in and out in just a few minutes. I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer this place is a gem."}
{"text":"The flavors are all really good. But the main issue is that someone needs to train the staff on how to properly prep the meat (both Chicken and Steak) as they both have particles of gristle and fat in them every third bite, which is really gross. This place would be a favorite if they could get the meat preparation down."}
{"text":"It was my First time to Mesquite taqueria. Fast service and delicious food! Steak tacos are amazing, and many topping options. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good tacos at a reasonable price.  You can add as many toppings you would like from the salsa bar.  Better than Chronic Tacos!"}
{"text":"First time here, the food was delicious, hands down the best tacos I've had. Definitely coming back and bringing the family this time around. Service was ok. Guy at the register had a heavy New York accent was vary hard to understand. Maybe they should have just made him the bouncer lol. 
All in all the good was great! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"\"10 out of 10, would dine again.\" My family and I came here for a late dinner, and we had an awesome first-experience. Their flour tortillas have a great taste and texture, meat is tender, salsa bar has lots of choices, and everything is very fairly priced. Workers were nice and considerate; looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"I have been to several taco places in Arizona.
(Taco Bell does Not Count as a real taco place.)
Mr. Mesquite got my vote as the best tasting tacos in Arizona. I have been trying to find a great tasting taco since I moved here from Yuma Az. I have found the place! Yuma Az. Has a lot great tasting taco  places, Mr. Mesquite just topped them all.
Mr. Mesquite keep making those delicious Tacos  
Thank you"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican places I have eaten. Although I am from Boston which is not really known for Mexican food this is still extremely good and tasty."}
{"text":"Just had the best quesadilla of my life! It came with sour cream and guacamole and the tortilla was toasted nicely"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken quesadilla, and chicken/steal taco combo. All very good food! They also have a salsa bar, with some pretty fantastic salsa."}
{"text":"We did not enjoy the food. Very plain food. Place was nice. Has a weird smell too. Sorry."}
{"text":"Short menu. Had the bowl, kids had burritos and tacos. Filled us up. Reasonably priced and service was quick. And nothing spectacular but solid. If chipotle was next-door though I probably would go there instead."}
{"text":"I was between appointments at the Mayo clinic and looking for a quick place to grab lunch; thank goodness for Yelp because this place is such a great find! You walk in to the intoxicating smell and sizzle of grilled meat, and there is a huge open mesquite grill just inside the entrance. There's something to be said about doing one thing and doing it well - the grilled steak and chicken are definitely the stars of the show. The menu is similar to Chipotle as you pick your protein and can have it one of four ways - in a taco, burrito, quesadilla, or protein bowl. As it was Taco Tuesday, I had a chicken and a steak taco for $2 each. I added a side of rice and beans and a fountain drink and the entire tab was less than $10. And you get a TON of food. The tacos themselves are pretty basic - flour or corn tortilla, choice of meat, cheese, guac But you can head over to their condiment bar and really load them up! The pico de gallo is super fresh and tasty. Top it off with a squeeze of fresh lime and their amaaaazing green sauce and you have a feast! They also have cabbage and onions for those who are inclined. Both meats were incredible flavorful and tender, though I was partial to the steak. The rice and beans were pretty standard fare - solid, but nothing to write home about. Same goes for the mango drink and horchata. Service is quick and friendly. Next time I'd probably skip them and add another taco! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"They keep it simple - chicken or beef, choose your delivery vehicle(burrito, quesadilla, tacos, etc.) and salsa from the bar.  Great flavor.  My only complaint is that the guacamole is watered down, I'd pay more for a chunky guac.  That being said, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first time here and I love the food. 
Friendly staff and the prices are average. 
I got a a stake burrito and it's delicious  

EA"}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've had in AZ reminds me of the Tacos in Rocky Point and awesome toppings bar! Go for the tacos best thing on the menu, the steak is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I went to eat lunch here on break when I walked inside I was greeted with a big welcome by the workers and they were extremely friendly to me. They showed and helped me with their menu. I ordered 3 tacos and they were AMAZING!!!. they use all really fire mesquite grill that I've never seen any other taco place use. They have chicken or stake tacos, burritos, or protein bowls. I've been going there on my break from work ever since."}
{"text":"good food good medium hot salsa good price.  the soda is a little expensive but that's everywhere."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight for the first time & I'm in love. This place is a hidden gem. The avocado sauce was sooooo good. Best taco Tuesday ever!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place hands down! The meat is so juicy and tender and the flour tortillas are delicious!!!! (I usually like corn). I've had basically everything on the menu here, so good! I go out of my way to come here. Used to go to the downtown location but their fly problem turned me off. 

This place is clean and they have the salsa bar that has the sauces and onion, cabbage, pickled onion and cilantro all readily available and everything is super fresh. 

The only con is the salsa and guacamole. The guac is just ok, I prefer to keep it off and eat just the salsa. The downtown location has a FANTASTIC SUPER HOT RED SALSA but this location has a mild, watered down, red salsa and it's kind of disappointing when I expect it to be spicy :( 

All in all, this is the best taco place! Love it here!"}
{"text":"Ok, a review from someone south of the border. I'll start off by saying this place exceeded my expectations. I'm from Sonora, and these tacos are pretty damn close to the tacos back home. The flavors were all there.  The guac in my tacos was flavorful and fresh. The steak and chicken were tender and juicy. The quesadillas were good too, the cheese was just right. Here is what I wasn't too crazy about: the flour tortillas weren't very soft. Not sure if they had been sitting out a little too long or if it's just the tortilla they use. Still good though. The selection of help-yourself toppings was great. The limes were just a little old and the onions cured in lime juice were too. And they weren't cut as finely as I recall. Their aguas frescas were just ok, not bad not great. The floor in the restroom (and some areas in the eating area) was pretty dirty. I saw the employees lounging around (I came in on a slow day) and all I could think was, if only one of them would sweep the floors or at least wipe down the tables. I guess that a management problem, not particularly one that affected how yummy my tacos were. 

Will be back Mr Mesquite!"}
{"text":"I really like the burrito bowl I got.  Service good but it was slow when I was in there.  A step up from Chipotles!"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos  were OK, The beef  was liike leather and tasted like theyhad been there for 8 hrs on the warming table.  The condiments were good.  The  was good also.  Price was excellent.  Maybe a second chance.  ."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Come here if you want to keep it authentic. This place is the only place I know that actually makes it authentic. Excellent!!"}
{"text":"The very best Street Tacos. Fresh is the key and these guys know how to do it. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"After only two trips to Mr. Mesquite, it has become my favorite choice for take-out Mexican food. Both the pollo and the carne asada are delicious and tender. The rice and beans are in line with what I expect when ordering Mexican food. Not especially fantastic, but not bad at all!

The salsa bar is a highlight, with both green and red traditional salsa, which are both delicious (and pack some heat!), pico de gallo, cilantro, limes, onions, etc.

I had the burrito with mixed meat (chicken and steak) both trips, and I will say I preferred it the second time, without the pickled onions, but that is completely personal preference. My wife got the protein bowl, which came in a large portion, and was as tasty as it looked (according to her). We got the quesadilla for our daughter, and I got her leftovers (as usual). That's gotta be the best quesadilla leftovers I've had since we moved to Phoenix two years ago. 

Being from San Diego, finding a top notch Mexican place was priority one, and after almost two years, we finally struck gold.

Way to go, Mr. Mesquite! You won us over!"}
{"text":"Now this place knows exactly how to make tacos. Carnes Asada to the max to perfection. 

Tia Shorty can use a lesson from this place!


Thank you Mr Mesquite!

You also have the best Agua de Jamaica!"}
{"text":"Great toco's, staff friendly...love salsa bar..

Very clean and fresh!!!!  Had chicken, carne and quesadilla...   great addition to this complex!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff. Conveniently located near the movie theatre. The carne asada tacos were delicious. The beans were flavorful. I ordered two tacos. My only complaint is that I wished they placed two tortillas (for each taco serving) instead of one."}
{"text":"If i made a yelp account just to review this place you know it has to be good!
To be honest, the only reason me and my friend went in is because we received some really good coupons in the mail. I had smelled this place when going to a movie the week before but wasn't sure where it was coming from. This will defiantly be one of my go to spots!

The carne asada was awesome! a little bit on the greasy side but not enough so to make it a big deal, the beans were a little watery, but still had flavor, and the tortilla tasted fresh and authentic (not just some packaged crap) Add all of this together and we realized it tasted EXACTLY like the place we visit every time we go to mexico.

I wasn't a fan of the green salsa but the red was bomb, my friend liked the pickled onions, i didn't even try them honestly because its not my thing but she loved them.

My first thought was that it would be another local business piggybacking off the success of chipotle by stealing its business model. I was wrong. Although its nothing super special, what they do have there (burritos and tacos) they do right and thats what i loved. if im ever in the mood for a good burrito this will be the place to go!"}
{"text":"Good food. Not a bad little place. Steak tacos are the bomb!! I stop in for lunch or dinner quite a bit. Glad this little spot is doing well here!! We love it."}
{"text":"Generous Sized street tacos.  I ordered three thinking they would be really small.....not, they were on the larger side. 

The chicken taco was amazing. The beef a little tough, but still good 

Thought they were closed as the sun blinds were down on the doors and we came in the evening. Suggestion open the blinds in the doors of an evening to let people know you are open and people are in here 

The flour tortillas were pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, friendly and efficient staff!!! Love this place!!! Will visit again!!"}
{"text":"Since I posted I have reconfirmed that employees do not get tips left on charge cards through the register.  I confirmed with employees that Owners are thieves. Don't go here. I enjoyed the food and the help is excellent. I always leave a tip, but I recently discovered that if the tip isn't cash it goes to the owner. All charged tips go to the owner not the employee who helps you. The employee doesnt get it. That is stealing. Same policy at both locations.."}
{"text":"New taco place that just recently opened. Great tasting Tacos. They grill the meat right in front of you. I had the chicken tacos and it had that great mesquite charcoal flavor. Very delicious and very affordable. Their rice and beans are good as well not the best but still yummy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried the street tacos - got one chicken and one steak on corn tortillas.

Chicken was pretty good, but steak is the way to go.  Make sure you hit the salsa bar to dress your taco properly!

Note that I was hungry when we got there and started eating before I took pics for y'all...sorry about that!

If you're in the area, give it a go!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Tacos but I have to say. This place makes pretty damn good tacos. The beef and chicken tacos are incredibly delicious and full of falvor. By just thinking about their red salsa makes me mouth watering. The owner/chief was so friendly and gave me a free tacos voucher."}
{"text":"Not a bad eateries for a simple taco. Carne Asada or Chicken are the choices. We stopped in late and the staff was accommodating. Only thing that would have made at burrito better is melted cheese. Liked the Salsa Bar."}
{"text":"Had steak burrito, bowl and steak taco and side of beans. Large portions and would have given 4 stars, but all the dishes were over salted. Who ever cooked that day was heavy handed with the salt."}
{"text":"Street tacos are on point!! Green salsa is very tasty and the red salsa has a nice kick to it. Solid salsas are key and they do a nice job. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Street tacos style. Mesquite charcoal. Carne asada. Pollo. Only tacos & burritos for the most part. In PHX that's not on the West or South side of town? Cool! On the NE side of town, N SCT to boot? Cool! That's pushes the rating from 4 to 5, come to think of it. Real good!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Totally caught off guard by the authentic flavors in the meats. I stumbled across this place because I was waiting for a movie to start and needed somewhere that wouldn't take to long to prepare food. I sure am happy I went!

I went on Tuesday, $2 taco special. They don't skimp at all on the toppings and there's a bar on the side to add more great stuff like slaw and cilantro. You can't go wrong with the mixed tacos (steak and chicken). I got them on corn tortilla. 3 tacos left me stuffed. 5 stars for the food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Just got here after the Waste Management Phoenix Open, and was shocked to see that it's not packed!?! This place is super good! Hit the spot, and the bill. Wasn't expecting to find tacos this good and this cheap. Still on the pricier side from where I buy my street tacos in central and downtown Phoenix, but worth coming for a quick bite. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Mr Mesquite is my new favorite lunch place. It smells like the finest meats when you walk in, and your belly is filled with the finest meats when you walk out. They also have soda in a glass bottle and use a modern POS system. The salsa bar is legit."}
{"text":"You want a good deal in a protein bowl, full of chicken and beef and all kinds of deliciousness... Here is where you go. This place is fast and convenient without losing their authentic Mexican flare. The burnt grills are a plus. I like hearty dishes and they always keep me coming back, so no reason why they won't see me again. I appreciated this place being open late after so many around hang the hat. I also appreciated their generous portions. Their guacamole needs a bit of work though. But overall it was good. I sampled the aguas frescas and they were good too. I specially like the Hibascus. Good stuff"}
{"text":"This was our first stop here...so we didn't want to review right away, but it I feel like the set up here is a little off in several places! It's set up like other order & wait for fresh tacos! We tried both chicken and carne asada beef. The chicken was a 5, the beef was a 4. The tortillas was warm and taste and the guco sauce they put on behind counter was good. The salsa bar isn't that impressive with flavors or appearance. The green salsa had too much vinegar, also the pickled onions also had too much vinegar. The pico was flavor wise lacking garlic and extra heat and salt. The hot sauce was ok at best. Too bad they had no guco sauce at salsa bar to make up for the other lamo sauces! The salsa bar by the front window in the heat and no shaded window is not good and the trash being 2 feet away from salsa bar is not smart setup in any place that serves food and the salsa bar by front door with heat in AZ no Bueno! 2 kids running the place they need help or trained in cleanup while on duty we came at 1:30 ON TUESDAY and salsa bar & table needed to be cleaned up & trash was over following out trash can. This is my rating overall 3!"}
{"text":"Hot as an inferno inside because the giant smokers inside. Dirty nasty bathrooms. Wont be back food was so so."}
{"text":"Got a mixed (steak and chicken) burrito with rice and beans today. It was amazingly fresh and delicious. Their salsas and pico were also very fresh and had great flavor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been in here twice. The first stop was in their soft opening, so I didn't want to review right away, but it didn't change much. I feel like the set up is a little off in here. It's set up like Chipotle, but they seem to always send you to sit down then ask you to come up a few minutes later to pick out what you want on your taco. The salsa bar isn't that impressive with flavor or appearance. I tried both chicken and beef. The beef was tough. Maybe it will get better with time, but I could pass on this place again after two tries."}
{"text":"Holy cow, this hidden gem tucked away in the middle of a huge strip mall is deserving of its high ratings on Yelp. The menu is simple (chicken or carne asada, flour or corn), the seating area is small, but the food (and smell) is just awesome!!! You must make it part of your daily lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food, generous servings, friendly staff. I love this place. I wish I could eat here more."}
{"text":"The smell outside draws you in. Our server Amer was very friendly  and did a great job helping us decide with some samples.  The menu was easy to read and the steak and chicken werr fresh. I do recommend on the steak that you ask to have it chopped up small in case you get tendon.  Lots of value for $8 burrito, and could have shared. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona/Scottsdale wanted to try out this place since the reviews were good. The food was excellent and they also have a salsa bar. Very fulfilling, meat was moist and seasoned well. Freshly made too! My only complaint was that it was a little hot eating inside the restaurant. Good place to get a quick bite to eat. Located next to the movie theater and Dicks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out last week and was not disappointed. The aroma of the mesquite hits your nostrils as soon as you enter. Meanwhile, your eyes catch the open fire grill slowly cooking the chicken and carne. Slowly and steady wins the race. 
I ordered the quesadilla supreme and had my choice of meat(of course I got the carne) and a chicken taco. While my bf got the bean and cheese burrito and a carne taco. The portions were huge and delicious. The two things that are missing would be some pico de gallo and maybe give another option for cheese. The cheese had hard bite to it-think it was hard jack cheese, maybe something more mild?
The owner was very nice and gave us two coupons for free tacos. Overall it was a win win!"}
{"text":"Smells great as soon as you walk in! Mesquite grilled carne (or chicken if you prefer) is the way to go!

Had three carne asada tacos. The grilled corn tortillas were like it is done down in Mexico.

The \"salsa & fixings\" bar was well stocked, the picked onions went great on the grilled beef with guac. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Glad to have another taco option in the area.  I do have to shrug my shoulders in disbelief at the prospect of having to pay $10 for two tacos and some beans and rice.  Sorry guys, that price point is out of whack for what you are offering. 

On par with a typical street taco you'd find on the West side but with a 200% premium for being located in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"You can't beat their $2 taco Tuesdays. The tacos are plain but good. It's meat and cheese on a tortilla of your choice. (Corn or flour) They have a salsa bar to grab some flavor on your way out. It's nothing fancy but it's a good quick taco joint close to home."}
{"text":"Decent food. Worth having but I like all white meat with chicken tacos and its mixed."}
{"text":"Love the tacos! Carne asada is yumm, the meat is perfectly grilled and u chose what else goes on the taco from the self service bar. The flour tortilla is great too! My fav taco place at the moment. Pls start serving cerveza!! :))"}
{"text":"Street tacos. Straight up street tacos. Done right. Meat is grilled over mesquite right there. 

Simple menu. But great food."}
{"text":"Everything you loved about the old location... with chairs.

They have burritos and quesadillas here, in addition to the delicious tacos that they serve at the other location.

I really liked being able to sit down and eat.  that was the only thing that could make the original location better."}
{"text":"We'll start with the pros. The meat here is very delicious: soft, moist and flavorful. The condiments bar has some yummy and unique (pickled onions, anyone?) things. The portions are generous (except for the guac, which is the tiniest dollop). And taco Tuesday is cheap- thumbs up there!
Then the cons. The place smells really weird and gross (I guess it's the burning charcoal of the grill, but it's so bad I can't stand to eat inside here; not good when it's 118 degrees out). And they don't have a salad option, which is very disappointing. Only tacos, quesadillas, or bowls. 
All in all, a decent place to grab a quick bite... and sit outside to eat it."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos! All the ingredients are fresh and the chicken taco taste amazing! My new favorite taco place in AZ."}
{"text":"I know this place has great reviews, but... this is why you should never trust Yelp. 

Beef taco: super fatty and old tasting 

Chicken taco: alright. Much better than beef, but tastes old. 

Corn torillas: crumpled before they were eaten. 

Guacamole: just add water 

Pickled onions: A freakin' plus! 

Limes: bueno

Rice: hard and over cooked but flavor, not bad. 

Salsa: water with some green things plus a few seeds. 

Beans: definitely odd. Not your typical refried beans 

Verdict: Mr. Mesquite is white. 
Not very authentic."}
{"text":"This was a nice find (thanks to Yelp) after a late night out in north Scottsdale. I love the modern/simple look inside, and it's kept very clean. The staff were kind, offered a military discount, and the carne asada burritos were well worth the six dollars and some change. I will be back, and definitely recommend this quaint little taco shop to anyone in the area craving fast and casual Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican Food. BEST Burrito I had in my life. Bye bye Chipotle!

They have an amazing salsa bar. The chicken was smoky and tender and the mango drink was so refreshing.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars I would. The carne asada tacos on corn tortillas were great. Amazing flavor and texture. The rice and  beans were right on too. The only reasons for the minus one star is the  bathroom was a bit rough and could have been cleaner (especially since we were the first customers today) and it'd be good to have chips as an option since they have all the ingredients readily available on the menu (salsa and corn tortillas) already. Also it was very warm in the dining room but perhaps the mesquite fired grill is overpowering the AC. Regardless, still highly recommend because the food taste great and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"The food truck is phenomenal. Once you see the grills fired up, make sure to get in line before it gets too long. The burritos are excellent but I've recently grown fond of their protein bowls as you get all the flavors, just without the tortilla. 

You can't go wrong with what you order but it's an absolute MUST to get a side of rice (and beans if you want). The spanish rice is extremely flavorful, unlike anything you've ever had. 

Pro-tip: If you order from the food truck, get ready for your clothes to smell because of the smoke from the grill. It's a great smell, honestly, but maybe a bit distracting when you try to get back to work after lunch!"}
{"text":"Food is easy and quick. But, it is consistently delicious. The mesquite charcoal they cook it on makes all the difference. Really takes up a notch. 

The staff that is hired is kind, polite and get the food out quickly. 

There's several types of drinks offered (fountain Coke, bottles or 'mexican' Coke and a few juices). 

Highly recommend if you are tight on time or perhaps need something quick AND delish! Hasn't been open for very long but I have been coming here a lot with family.

Continues to be a family fav!"}
{"text":"Steak tacos were delicious! Got a chicken protein bowl as well but chicken and beans were too salty for our taste- but the bowl was a very big portion, so that was a plus for our family. Would definitely come back for the steak tacos, though! Plenty of meat and a great toppings bar with pickled red onions, cabbage, cilantro, etc. Very fast service and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! The salsa bar is awesome and the chicken is wonderful!!!!!!! I love that they grill it over an open flame! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad we stopped by for a quick meal. It was totally delicious! Perfect texture on the corn tortilla, amazing steak, great chicken, perfect toppings. Can't beat the taco Tuesday deal. New favorite spot in this part of town! Up there with all the other greatest taco spots in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Menu is limited but I think that helps them focus on what they do make, freaking awesome! You do walk out smelling like mesquite. 
I plan to be back for catering as well!"}
{"text":"Mediocre tacos. The tortillas were cold and so was the meat. I ordered beans and the beans taste as if they were straight out of a can. Overpriced for the tacos but they did have a decent salsa bar but I wished the salsa was actually spicy."}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos. Made fresh while you wait. The chicken and steak tacos have a great smoked flavor. A small place with a limited menu but one of the best values around. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm so inlove with the service and the food omg the best carne asada tacos in the valley"}
{"text":"The secret is the mesquite grilled chicken and beef as the base ingredient to the tacos and burritos. Cafeteria style, clean-your-own-table-before-you-sit-down (and then again when you depart).  3 street tacos and small portion of rice and beans, served in styrofoam container, fountain drink, tip, $18.  Food truck tacos at North Scottsdale prices."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 4.5 stars. Food was OK. Service was horrible. The cashier did not smile. Did not thank us. She was miserable. This place won't last long with service like that."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Unassuming location but the simplicity is very good! I wish they had chips too--their salsa bar is so good."}
{"text":"Fantastic Carne Asada- it's amazing
Portion sizes are quite large.
The protein bowl really could feed 2 
The people are very nice...

Pickled Onions... love them 
Only area of improvement... no paper towels in the bathroom and the floor needed to be swept. We did come in after the lunch rush so I get it but to get 5 stars these needed to be perfect too.

I absolutely WILL comeback and tell my friends!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good taco place and looked up Yelp for reviews.  Even though we came strictly based on the reviews the place itself didn't disappoint either.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The customer service at this restaurant was great which is why I was surprised my food wasn't that great. I ordered 2 carne Asada tacos with a rice & bean combo. The rice has a pickle flavor which I am not a fan of. The carne Asada was dry and had weird bits of fat. The beans were good. The looked home made. Overall, other reviews I read said they make your food fresh. When I went they served it out of containers like chipotle does. I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"This place is the #bomb.com!!!! Especially if your a person that doesn't eat pork!!! And they have two of the best proteins to choose from steak  and chicken  yum !!!!! Everything on the menu is awesome !!! And you can order online off Ubereats and Potsmates....."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito and it was awesome!  I would definitely recommend trying this place!! : )"}
{"text":"Great chicken tacos with fantastic pico de gallo and guacamole. My friend got the protein bowl with steak and chicken which he said was great. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe and everything is freshly made! This is why I love Yelp* . These guys are in a strip mall. I would have driven by without give it a thought, but this father and son team is killing it with fresh tacos! Amazing and s great price! Just two tacos and I was stuffed."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast service. It's hard to find a good taco place in Scottsdale that isn't completely Americanized. This place has tacos that are bigger than a quarter and for a reasonable price. Go to other Mexican restaurants here and you'll be paying a lot for less than average tacos that won't even fill you up. They also have great Horchata and Jamaica! Definitely making this a regular spot for me and my family."}
{"text":"I do security in the complex this restaurant resides, so I have alot of choices there St Scottsdale 101 location. I am a regular and ay the moment I am the Dutch. 

Food: Ive had Carne esada burrito and tacos many times. The tortillas are tasty (slightly thin for my liking), the steak is absolutely the best I've ever tasted. It's smokey, hint of spicy, and tender! 
I usually just add rice, beans and red sauce. 

Price: the cost for the food isn't to bad but it's not low. The steak well hike the cost but it's worth and that's what matters. 

Seating: The restaurant offers inside and outside seating with umbrellas to block the sun. They provide the condiments bar, a digital drink machine by Coke, and Hispanic drink dispenser as well. 
The service isnt bad at all, you can tell some of the workers are still learning the customer service curve but they are attentive and work fast. The workers are great people here and the food is tasty. 
COME EAT!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, Excellent , Excellent no I mean horrible stay away because I don't like when it gets so busy I can't get a place to sit. All the meats are amazing and burritos are a good size. Protein bowl a hoodie also. No I mean it's all horrible. Don't come I want it all myself"}
{"text":"Beef DRY and small amounts for what you're paying for. Chicken was good but isn't that what a chain food restaurant can do also. Fair but I'll keep driving by as I have been."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I haven't been to their other location so I was pleasantly surprised when my wife and I decided to drop on in.

We stuck with the chicken and steak street tacos, which both were really good. The mesquite grill they use gives a nice flavor to the meat. Also, the tacos are very clean - not greasy at all.

I'd definitely recommend this place if you are in the North Scottsdale area and wanting Mexican street food. They definitely better than Juan Jamie's."}
{"text":"I was staying at the JW Marriott near by and saw this place highly rated for tacos. Great for a quick bite, awesome burritos and tacos! The only other thing I could have asked for was a small children's menu and a cold beer."}
{"text":"BEST tacos in town. They taste straight off a taco cart in rocky point. We got a pollo and carne Asada Taco and a chicken quesadilla. SO good, great quality. Legit place, will definitely be returning and spreading the word."}
{"text":"I love the food here, my favorite is the quesadilla but the tacos are excellent. Small menu so everything is always fresh."}
{"text":"The tacos were really good, but the price adds up quick if you order multiple tacos and make it a combo (add rice and beans, does not include drink).  Definitely a place to visit for lunch."}
{"text":"When you walk in the atmosphere leads to a great
meal and easy atmosphere to chat and enjoy yourself.  Very hip, love the bags of charcoal.   The meat has such a wonderful flavor.  The employees are very fast and gracious, when I asked them if they liked working there, they said they loved it and they had been there for three years.  The quality of the food reflected the love they had for the restaurant.   The guacamole is the real deal as well as the tacos, protein bowl, and Quesadas.   The pico del gayos flavor is spot on.  It's like you are tasting Mexico.  Perfect for that craving. Definitely would come again :)"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME. I had the Carne Asada  protein bowl. Great price and a TON of food. Honestly I should have split with someone.  I couldn't eat but half. I will be back for sure. Those pickled onions were yummy!"}
{"text":"What's with all the 4 star reviews that say how great the food, service, atmosphere etc is? I think this place deserves the coveted 5 star ranking.  Here's my take on Mr Mesquite! 

I have been looking for a taco joint like this forever.  Real grilled meats cooked over wood is so much better tasting than any other method. So few restaurants attempt this but the tradeoff of coming out smelling like smoke is worth it imho.

Tried the chicken this time. It was very tender and juicy. Surprising considering the fact that it's prepared over an open flame. They serve it with cheese and guacamole. I usually don't eat guacamole (hate cilantro and too many places add it) but this stuff was like avacado butter! Fantastic smooth texture and no hint of cilantro to be found. HUGE WIN IN MY BOOK!
 
Lastly the salsa bar. I never saw one with bowls of pre shredded cabbage before. It added such a nice crunch. Love they offer diced onions as I never get Pico (again that evil plant ruins it for me) and the salsa itself tasted great. No overly seasoned salsa here.

Glad I tried it, will definitely be back especially since they open at 10 (my normal 1st meal of the day time) and can't wait to try the steak! Muy bueno!

UPDATE: Been back a gazillion times now. I am completely hooked on the mixed taco. Steak and chicken in the same taco is unique and a HUGE win in my book. Plenty filling just having one even after a huge weightlifting workout! Fantastic staff. Feels like I'm Norm walking into cheers everytime I go. And it's so inexpensive!!!"}
{"text":"Really unique little taco joint, They have an actual large charcoal grill, front and center. The meat is great, the tacos are very simple and tasty. 

They have a nice salsa bar, but there aren't any chips on the menu...weird...

Pricing is very reasonable, and the staff is friendly.

Overall, great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great tacos the rice and beans are average at best .. also found a screw in the side of onions .. probably won't come back due to that"}
{"text":"Awesome mexican food. Really, truly what arizona mexican food stands for. Fresh tortillas, flavorful meat, and simple fresh toppings. The red salsa is hot and acidic like its supposed to be (so tired of salsa that tastes sweet), the green is bright and full of lime, all of the cabbage cilantro and onions are super crisp, and the pickled onions are on the money. This place nailed counter service mexican food, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time visiting here. Was in the area and looked on Yelp for recommendations this place came up. Very clean inside just two employees working. One on cashier and one cooking. It was very slow during the time I visited. The salsa bar was half empty and the limes at the salsa bar were atrocious they weren't green anymore but a brown color. The red salsa was the best of the two. Food was ok not great perhaps the most disappointing was he guacamole that they put on your taco it wasn't a vibrant green it was a brown color a light brown that looked to be the color of a mousse . Apparently they didn't throw out the out guacamole. Presentation is everything in food but the sauce was definitely lacking I scraped it off. Don't think I'll return 

As an update I was contacted by the produce manager for this place who was nice and offered to bring me tacos or tortillas in exchange for a better review because he felt he dropped the ball. I admire a vendor for doing that but what I don't understand is if this review is not of the businesses liking why wasn't I contacted by the manager or owner"}
{"text":"We tried this place out the other night.  I honestly have mixed feelings, which is why the three stars.  There wasn't anything great about the place.  And there wasn't anything horrible.  But I would say there were more negatives than positives.

I guess the one main positive is the simplicity of the menu.  It's very easy to put your meal together without a bunch of upselling.

I guess the flavors were good...?  I mean, they weren't bland. We did like the mesquite flavors.  But that's where the less than good stuff comes in.

The only thing \"fresh\" is that your tortillas are warmed up on a small grill/griddle.  The meat was all precooked and sitting in steam pans, kept warm.  So who knows how long it's been in there?  I guess I'd like to see some stuff being cooked fresh, while prepping with stuff already made, so at least I feel like what I'm getting is fresh?

We asked for guacamole on our tacos.  Rather than put fresh guacamole on the tacos, they squirt something out of a bottle into a sample cup?  I guess if I was going to one of those \"it's 3am and I'm drunk\" kinds of places, yeah it makes sense.  But at $30/couple to eat... some fresh guacamole would be nice.

The salsa bar needed some attention too.  Almost everything was topped off and full... except the one main red sauce.  You were left to scrape the bottom of the only bowl with a tiny ladle to get what you could out of it. Seems like that would be the one you would want full, not two full bowls of everything else?

We may go back and give it another shot.  Like I said... nothing horrible.  Just not totally impressed."}
{"text":"We had the steak quesadilla, chicken protein bowl, steak burrito and a bean burrito. All the flavors tasted excellent. I love how the meat flavor as the Smokey Mesquite taste! Both gentleman who were working there were very friendly and accommodating. They went out of their way to make sure everything was right and tasted great.


Very good food will be back again."}
{"text":"I tried Mr Mesquite because the web site says \"Our meats are grilled on  our mesquite grills, and served to you fresh and fast.\" 
When I walked in there were in fact Chicken being grilled. Oh Yeah!
Sadly, and this is the reason I didn't give 5 stars, My burrito was made with chicken sitting on the line already chopped. The worker squirted in something- water? It was clear- into the  chicken on the prep line and stirred it. I was really really hoping the get chicken right off the grill. I went with it and the burrito ended being so freaking good.
I would go back. I WILL go back. 
Just a note I stopped in in between lunch and dinner time. Maybe when it's busy you get off the grill? I hope so and plan to find out.

The beans and rice were super tasty..."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and patient. The steak tacos were full of flavor and it was a really good portion of meat! The flour tortillas were also delicious! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars but they don't offer chips like at all not even for an upcharge. You would think with that amazing salsa bar chips would have been a great compliment to my burrito. Get some chips and keep the gringos happy. I understand they are trying to keep it simple but calm down a little."}
{"text":"(Through Ubereats) Ordered the carne asada tacos w/ rice and beans and horchata... everything was heavily \"seasoned\" with salt! The rice was also heavily undercooked. The horchata wasn't too bad, but it was essentially an iced chai latte. Not sure if I'd give this place another shot."}
{"text":"OK, Mr. Mesquite is actually amazing. Just be ready to wash your hair after you visit because that smoky grill smell permeates everything. In a good way!

If you want cheap, fast, and delicious Mexican food in the area, this is the winner. I've tried both a bowl (jam packed with fillings and had plenty enough leftover for lunch the next day) and burrito (THOSE. TORTILLAS.) and you can't lose either way.

The menu is small, which I think is a plus. Focus on a small number of items and do them well and you're winning. Choose either steak or chicken (or just bean and cheese) and choose them in taco, burrito, quesadilla (THESE LOOK HUGE AND AMAZING) or bowl form. Mix-ins include refried beans, rice, pico, lettuce, pickled red onions (YES!) and guac. I will say, and guys, please don't pull my Millenial card, but the guac is meh. It's a runny sauce-type avo spread. Just not my style. Everything else? SO GOOD. The salsa bar has this amazingly-garlicky verde salsa that I want to bathe in.

4 stars all around!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places for tacos in the country. They have superb carne asada tacos with corn tortillas. I had the chicken and beef and a beef only taco. The guacamole was good. They have a bar with spicy hot sauce, which was different. Most places do not have a spicy enough sauce for me. It was closest to tacos I've had in Central and South America."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays is where it's at! 

Carne Asada tacos are very yummy, and on Tuesday's very affordable. Skip the rice and beans - not so good.

Located on the west end of the Scottsdale 101 shopping center by the Harkins theater."}
{"text":"I live very far from this location, but I have business that brings me to the area at times, and I never miss a chance to have lunch or dinner at this little taco shop. They are hands down the best tacos in the valley. It's so true what they advertise about serving \"street food\"! The flavors and freshness of all the ingredients rival even the fanciest of taco shops. Don't let the crisp, clean decor fool you. This is not a chain like Chipotle or Q'Doba. This is the genuine article. Real food, made fresh with love by the friendliest employees around! I'm amazed all over again every time! Can't get enough! And I'm a Mexican food addict so I should know. You have to go eat at Mr Mesquite!"}
{"text":"Simple menu but great food and reasonably priced too. Carne asada is perfectly done , generous helping of meat and condiments plus a well stocked condiments bar. 
Awesome burritos!!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped here out of curiosity after eating at the Kabob place next door several times. For the most part, it's your typical taco shop, with their claim to fame being a mesquite meat flavor (hence the name)...and they do mesquite pretty well! $3 for a single steak taco that came with cheese, guacamole and flour tortilla...could have opted for a corn tortilla. Not a big fan of fluorescent colored guacamole, but was still tasty, nonetheless. Would def give this place another try."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves a higher rating and it's underrated. First time walking in, wasn't sure what to expect I thought the prices would be exorbitantly expensive but I was pleasantly surprised. The taste of the mesquite charcoal definitely sets the food apart from the competition. Amazing taste and flavor. The sides are wholesome and great. I love this place! I know where to come from now on. Plus they told me taco Tuesdays are $2! Score! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, stop what you are doing and go there now.

Don't waste time with the rice and beans, the tacos are the main attraction!! 2 chicken 2 steak and pile on the pickled onions!!


You are welcome!!"}
{"text":"Had steak taco-tortilla dripped grease, meat had spots that were cool temp, not consistently heated. Very few tables, but managed to get one outside. Table & chairs were dirty. Didn't see anyone cleaning between customers. Won't return."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying I love tacos, real authentic tacos.  I'm so happy to have his taco spot in Scottsdale!! 
The meat and chicken are grilled over mesquite, making it rea carne asada. 
The tortillas and salsas are like if I was sitting in a taco stand in Mexico. We really enjoyed our tacos, will definitely be back!

My only wish is that they had pastor. But I'll keep chowing down on the carne asada"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh tacos! Mhmm. Some of the best tacos I've had. My favorite is the carne asada and I love that they have a combination one. 

Taco Tuesdays - only $2 per a taco! 

Cute atmosphere with its own \"toppings\" bar on the side. Choose either corn or flour tortilla. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The protein bowl is really good! Large portions, spicy salsa, and tasty carne asada will keep this girl coming back. Plus, they have horchata, jamaica, and mango drink! The prices are good and the guys are super nice. I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is so simple but SO good. Their carne asada is amazing. Clean establishment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito was good!  It was a good size with a nice amount of meat. Love fire grilled flavor. The tortillas were tasty. 

They had a nice sized salsa bar. Staff was friendly and helpful in answering questions! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Comparable to a Senior Taco but with a very limited menu. Only ordered tacos (soft shell is the only option). Both steak and chicken were flavorful and moist. And, they give you plenty of protein. The salsa bar is the best I've encountered at a fast casual (pico, pickled onions, chopped white onion, limes, salsas, all the chopped cilantro you could ever want- yassssss!, and more). The guac is the light green liquefied pasty stuff (but at least they don't charge extra for it). 

Service was helpful and friendly. 

I'll be back when I'm the mood for soft shell tacos."}
{"text":"This is a small little Mexican food stop within the Scottsdale 101 complex that left me with mixed feelings.  I happened by this place on a weeknight at the invitation of one of my friends.  They offer tacos, burritos, and assorted other Mexican staples.

The service was quick and we were given our food shortly after ordering.  I ordered a taco meal combo and a burrito.  First issue was they got my order wrong on the burrito, giving me steak instead of the chicken I asked for.  Not a huge deal, but given that we were almost the only customers there, it was disappointing.  The taco meal was the best part of the experience.  They have a little buffet bar to add on additional salsa, cilantro, and other vegetables, which I took advantage of.  All in all it was tasty, however, the guacamole looked like it was made in a blender on liquify, and reminded me of the green slime I would see on Nickelodeon as a kid.  Not my favorite.  The rice and refried beans that accompanied the taco were pretty good though!

The burrito was more disheartening.  I'm not a big fan of steak in Mexican food.  I find it usually contains an inordinate amount of fat/gristle and this was no exception.  In addition it just did not taste that great and lacked flavor.  I would sooner pick up a burrito from Chipotle in the future.

Outside of the food, the restaurant itself is fine.  It was clean, however, it was pretty dead after 6:30.  We were the only ones there chatting for probably another hour after that.  Not a terrible experience, but I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Super good tacos.  The best.  Mesquite grilled right inside the restaurant.  I don't know if you can call it a restaurant.  Just a few tables.  It seems more of a takeout place.  The smell alone is worth a visit though.  Highly recommended!

Update: please get rid of the screen that you have to sign with your finger.  How many people touched it before me?"}
{"text":"Really good carne asada burro. Aguas frescas are your run of the mill flavor. These would be better if homemade.  Rice and frijoles are just OK."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Restaurant (tables, salsa bar, restrooms) were all dirty. Staff not very friendly either. Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great location and food. Cost is average I believe for the area. I had the chicken burrito and it was fantastic. I'll be going again soon!"}
{"text":"Tried out a NEW Taco Tuesday Spot today.

Kid making the food and working the counter was great!!
I had 2 coupons for a Free Taco each.
Thats it. No Money exchanged hands.
For an investment of $4, the kid knew he would have me and the Wife hooked.

Real Wood under the Chicken and Asada.

Great Salsa bar as well. Cabbage!! Not Lettuce. Awesome.
Half a Lime. Not tiny little chunks.

Again their $4 investment will have me coming back many more times.

Looking forward to trying the Protein Bowl!!"}
{"text":"Best taco joint in Scottsdale, hands down. Great staff, great service, great food! I always feel welcome here. The cook even comes to my table and says hi. Great people! 

The carne asada and chicken tacos are money but if you really want to change your life, get the carne asada quesadilla."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and each time has gotten progressively worse. The first time the place was clean and the food was good. Fast forward a few times later (within a period of about 3 months) and the service & cleanliness has tanked. I walked in there a couple weeks ago to grab a couple tacos with my brother in law and while we were inside there was another couple waiting for what seemed a while. I asked them if anyone was working and they said they didn't know. I peeked into the kitchen and saw the two employees stuck to their phones oblivious to anything around them - I yelled out to them and they came running out. As we waited our turn to order we looked around at the incredibly dirty tables and the salsa bar that was a hot mess; we looked at each other, nodded and walked out - neither of us were in the mood to chance getting sick."}
{"text":"Wow!!  What a treat!  Was literally walking by and saw the place was open. Knocked our socks off!  Carne asada  burrito was fantastic. The place is still opening up so they are slowly getting things organized. Soon we won't be able to even get a table. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"These people absolutely nailed it on the flavors. Absolutely nailed it.

It's a tiny place - should be twice, maybe three times the size. Ordering takes a bit of time, but your food is made to-order right in front of your eyes. Bags of mesquite line the service line and the grill is right there front and center so there's no mistaking they're being honest about being \"mesquite grilled\"... no flavor additives here - it's really grilled on a mesquite grill.

They offer both corn and flour tortillas and the tortillas are plancha-warmed when you order your food. They only have two meats - chicken and beef. Each taco is accessorized with cheese and a squeeze of avocado salsa. There is also a fresh salsa bar with the following: cabbage, pickled red onions (spot---on!!!!) and pico, salsa roja and salsa verde as well as Mexican limes cut in half.

Again - the flavors - they NAILED IT. If someone blind folded me and led me into this place, I'd think I was in front of a roadside taco stand in Mexico."}
{"text":"This place is ok. In my opinion it's rated a little higher than it should be. The food was good but I don't think it's 4.5 star good. The price is great for the protein bowl. The tacos I think might be a little high but I haven't seen one. The salsa bar was empty when I rolled in an hour before closing so I couldn't tell you anything else about it. I did however get some of the red sauce and it was good but spicy. You only have two choices of meat, chicken or steak. Come try it but know that it's not going to give you that wow this is 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just delicious food thats cheap too! The Smokey mesquite flavor of the meats is excellent. The salsa bar is also nice; the pickled onions are awesome in the tacos. If you're looking for some good tacos at a good price, look no further!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had this side of Cabo! Everything a good street taco should be...flavorful meat, a little Guac and topped with salsa , cilantro, onion, tortillas were fresh and not too heavy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. The guys behind the counter were hustling to fill orders as it was busy. Only a few tables indoors so I was lucky to snag a table. Too hot to eat outside. I had a Chicken and Carne Asada Taco. The Chicken was spiced nicely and tender. The Carne had no flavor and was very chewy. The beans and rice were very ordinary. I would give it another try for the Chicken Tacos. BTW on a warm day, it is very warm in this restaurant with the grill going and the sun streaming in. Crank the air."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here today and the place is luckily was empty around 5-ish! My Beef Burrito were amazing! Good, juicy, just perfect! My husband ordered the carne asada and the chicken tacos they were very good. All in all great food and good price."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a movie. A bit surprised as to how small it is, but I'm used to small taco places. But, as a non-meat eater, I was surprised to see no fish options, just beans. Also, the salsas, etc were almost empty and  no ice or any coolant with them. Not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been three times to the North Scottsdale location. I liked the food but the facility needs to be cleaned. 

I love the salsa bar, especially the green salsa. It's everything I want. The chicken and beef tacos and quesadillas are great. The place smells amazing with the mesquite wood cooking chicken and steak real time. 

A thorough deep cleaning of the restaurant's, tables, floor, walls, glass, bathrooms, salsa bar etc would help.   There are rags and food in places on the floor that have been there for weeks. 

Crack the whip, make spotless like a restaurant in that area should be and it's nearly a 5 in my book. I look forward to being given a chance to update my review from my last 3 visits over 4 weeks."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to come for tacos in North Scottsdale because the food is absolutely delicious, the place is clean and it's inexpensive.  They were really nice salsa bar that includes pico de gallo cabbage onions and other salsas. I always get the carne asada tacos, two for $6.  There's usually always a place to park when the workers are very kind and nice. This is on my definitely recommend list."}
{"text":"I can't express how fortunate I was to come across Mr Mesquite Taqueria!  I come here at least 3 times a week and they not only make delicious food but have incredible customer service as well.  They catered our grand opening for our business last week and our guests absolutely loved the food!  If you're looking for a great spot to eat or for help in catering a event this is the spot.  I look forward to having them cater all of my facilities events in the future!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing tacos, rice and beans! Their salsa bar is super yummy too! The only thing I wish they had was chips! I always get the chicken tacos, rice and beans. Very fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I can see why Mr Mesquite has such high reviews. Located next to Harkins. We were looking for quick bite to eat before catching a movie and just stumbled in here. As soon as we walked it, we saw large amount of chicken being grilled over open flames. I knew I wanted some of it. We settled on a burrito and quesadillas. You choose the meat and add-ins to your order. 
I was very impressed with the quality of meat; both chicken and steak was very moist and flavorful. Did I mention the massive size of the entrees? We were really hungry so we managed to chow down every bite but 3 people can easily share 2 entrees. 
The only thing I didn't care for here was the guacamole that came with the quesadillas. It didn't really taste like avocados at all, very watered down. However, that didn't take away from the deliciousness of all the entrees. 
I cant wait to go back and try their tacos."}
{"text":"Tables were not cleaned - still had remnants of rice, pick de gallo and cabbage. We ordered the bowl, tacos, and a side of rice and beans. Meat was soft. That was the only good thing about this place. Everything was saltyyyyyyy! The side dishes are nothing to rave about - it looked about a couple of days old. Feeling bloated now from all that sodium- blah!"}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada. Very fresh salsa bar - the green salsa is the best. Great location too - right by the movie theatre! Owner was very nice. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best, most flavorful Chicken Quesadilla we ever had! Mesquite grilled chicken with Mozzarella cheese. Fresh salsa bar where you select your toppings ( freshly made Pico De Gallo for example ). Don't expect to be able to eat inside. This place is very busy and they only have 5 tables. There are a couple of tables outside, if it's not too hot out."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place! I was really happy with the outstanding customer service. The food was excellent and smelled incredible. I would highly recommend this restaurant. I Will definitely returned. Everyone should try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Simple but delicious tacos.

I was pumped when I realized they had a second location in north Scottsdale - which serves Burritos. This is my favorite taco place in the valley hands down."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are now favor day because of the best street tacos ever. Great place for all"}

I wanted something easy and Bunny had come out as well and he was looking for some MEAT to sink his teeth into.  Enter in this place.  It's located in a HUGE strip mall so there was PLENTY of parking.  It was also FLAMIN HOT out as in was AUGUST in PHOENIX!  Need I say more.  

We hopped out the car and made a dash inside to soak in the FREE AC and much to our surprise it was HOTTER THAN A jalapeños cooch inside the place, which was only a few degrees cooler than it was OUTSIDE!  WTH?  JE-SUS, MARY ANNNDDDD JOSEPH where is the AC!

The first thing we ordered were drinks to cool the H*LL OFF so we could think.  AIN'T NOBODY interested in eating when it 90 EF'in Degrees inside with 100% humidity!  I'm surprised the State didn't shut them down if the AC was broken, which I suspect it wasn't they just weren't using it.

So AFF-TA that we were able to read the menu without SWEAT running into our eyes and having the salt burn out our corneas.  Bunny went with some sort of meat plate.  I mean you can see them roasting the dead animal on the SPIT right in front of your eye and FEEL the heat coming off the grill.  I got a veggie burrito.  They are NOT VEGGIE FRIENDLY AT ALL nor do they do anything with fish.  ALL MEAT!

We wait and refill our cup with cool liquids while we wait.  I SWEATIN LIKE A POLITICIAN in CHURCH trying not to loose my mind. We contemplated JUST LEAVING but GOD ONLY knows WHY WE DIDN'T!

Our food finally comes up and we go grab it.  They have a salsa bar like the one in Baja Fresh.  Same Salas and items same concept!  We dug in and ate lunch!  It was lack luster at best.  Noting inside the rito seemed seasoned.  Was more like they took it straight out a can or frozen package.  Bunny wasn't impressed either and he LOVES MEAT!  He said the meat was season either which is sad.

The only good thing about this place was I LOST 15lbs JUST SWEATING like a wildebeest inside this establishment!  I would not RECCOMEND this place even in the winter when you could warm up from the cold air because the food was good!"}
{"text":"Small Taco Shop next to the Cine Capri 101 that previously was occupied by a Hot Dog Restaurant. 

We ordered Carna Asada Tacos and a Carna Asada Burrito both with flour tortilla. Later realized that they were pretty much the same thing except on the tacos they placed guacamole. You have a choice of steak or chicken, flour or corn tortillas and taco  or burrito.
Was pretty good for a quick bite before or after a movie and a good alternative from burgers.
Overall would come back again but not really go out of my way to make it back."}
