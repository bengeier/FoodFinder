{"text":"I've been to Caren's twice now, both Saturday nights.  Food was excellent as was the service. As some posters mentioned, yes it is pricey, but why wouldn't you check that before going?  The food I have ordered was excellent and worth the cost."}
{"text":"Can't say that my experience was too different from the other reviewers'. The service was poor from the start. My friends and I arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation. Upon entering and giving my name, the man \"greeting\" us (I use quotation marks, as it was hardly a greeting) looked at his watch in an annoyed manner as if we were inconveniencing him by arriving before the scheduled time. Not a friendly welcome at all.
The service continued to be quite bad throughout the evening. The scowly man who greeted us was (yay!) also our waiter. What luck. My friend said she had a question about the duck confit, to which he responded \"What about it - it's duck confit\". We repeatedly had to ask to have our water refilled. My friends ordered a bottle of wine and their wine glasses were not refreshed regularly. Finally, my other friend ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio that had obviously gone off and tasted like vinegar. When she asked for a replacement glass, he had the nerve to tell her that that's what the wine is supposed to taste like. Her replacement glass was basically slammed down on the table without apology. 
The saving graces were the chef who made an effort to come out and ask how we liked the food. But unfortunately he and his food are not enough for me to return to Carens. Or to warrant a second star."}
{"text":"We ordered a $17 bottle of beer and were very excited to drink it. The waitress poured the beer into what looked like an IKEA water glass, like an amature leaving a full glass of head. We were willing to let that slide - she was nice, she apologized and we laughed it off. Then a second waiter came to top of the glasses and did the same thing. We were annoyed, but again laughed it off.

The bar owner then came up to us and went on and on about how that is how one is supposed to pour a beer. We joked and said that is not how we like it, and that this is not how we drink our beer. He proceeded to become quite aggressive, and basically treated us terribly. 

I have never seen a bar owner treat customers so poorly at what should be a classy establishment in Rosedale. All the best to this terrible Resto/ bar in a tough market in a nice area. We will never go back and will make sure our friends avoid this place. For those looking for a bar in the area, try Boxcar social, the Monks table, or Rebel house for a much better experience."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a martini and I asked for a glass of wine. Two parties came in after us and had drinks delivered while we still waited.  My husband decided to pass on the martini and we flagged over another server and asked him to cancel the cocktail.  (It hadn't been started yet) We asked several times and the waiter kept saying that the martini would be his gift.  Have never worked so hard to try to cancel a drink.  We finally gave up and say ok to the martini.

Got our food, which was just ok.  And then came the bill, and, guess what, there was the charge for,the martini.  Weird service, so so food and so loud you can't talk unless shouting.  

Won't go back"}
{"text":"I visited Carens during summer for cheese fondue. Inside was very classy the tableware and everything was set very beautifully.
When I went, there was only one person working, this was at around 2pm. I'm not sure if it was because of this that my experience wasn't so great. Being a waitress and I believed responsible for making the dishes, as I saw her making our fondue.
The cheese fondue was alright we also had chocolate fondue. It was presented beautifully and tastes average. Overall everything was ok not a spectacular experience, I expected more."}
{"text":"A snazzy place! There is a piano at the front door. Decor was fresh and classy. Don't show up in your PJs. Had a reservation for brunch on a Sunday. Glad we did; it quickly filled up! 

To start, I got an Americano and it was really good. I could have that everyday! We went for the prix fix brunch. It started with cheddar scones. So flaky and fresh. Jam was on the plate with them and my friend thought it was weird. I loved it, a little sweet and a little salty. Don't knock it until you've tried it!

I had Eggs Benny, because brunch. It was your standard Eggs Benny. Fried potatoes and salad were good. With our meals we had a mimosa. They pack a punch! I've had mimosas over brunch before, but I think this was the first one that actually had alcohol in it. Tasty!

The chocolate cake. So rich. Smooth, sweet and everything I thought it would be. My friend was full, but I cleared all of my plates. Portions were pretty good.

The service was pleasant. Attentive, but not intrusive. 

Their dinner menu looks pretty good; perhaps another visit is in order"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for brunch on a Sunday, it was relatively empty so there was no difficulty getting a table. The back is very beautiful, the tables have fresh flowers on them and the decor is stunning. The atmosphere was great, warm, pleasant and overall inviting. 
As for the food, I got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and my partner got there croque madame. My eggs Benedict was great, the salmon was fresh, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the presentation was lovely. We were both very pleased with our food and it came out soon after we ordered. For vegetarians, there really aren't many options for brunch other than the omelet. 
The only downfall to this place is the price - for an eggs Benedict, 17$ is a bit steep of a price. Although it was great, the price was far too high, especially for brunch."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff, but expected the food to be better. The French onion soup was subpar and the fondue portion was too small to share despite what the waiter had advised."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular. Dined on a Saturday night with no reservation, the wait staff very kindly squeezed us in. Prices were fair, wine selection was very good, and the interior decor is both classy and comfortable, while making a small space not feel at all stuffy. Would definitely recommend.

Entree's: mac and cheese, and scallops - 5/5
Wine: New Zealand Sauv Blanc - 5/5"}
{"text":"We love Carens Rosedale? for the experimental cheese boards - our introduction to the noble union of wine and cheese! Just a bite from our full experience review."}
{"text":"Was walking up Yonge and happened upon Carens. Went in for a late lunch around 3:30pm and were the only ones there other than two ladies on the patio. 
Atmosphere was nice, piano, belt run ceiling fans, mirrors and art. There was a large dining room in the back but we sat close to the front in a corner booth.
Weren't in a drinking mood which seemed to displease the man behind the bar, we over heard him saying \"what's that's all they ordered?\". Already off to a bad start before the food even arrived.
Started with the crab cakes which were flavourful but dripping in oil. Even the small salad that garnished the plate was overly oiled with little seasoning. 
For entrees we both decided to go for the Gorgonzola burgers. They took a ridiculously long time to come out especially seeing as we were now 2/8 people in the place. Burgers were great but the buns had to have been two days old. Very dry and one cracked and fell into pieces. The salad was under seasoned and the \"Frits\" we're small pieces of broken fries. Home made ketchup wasn't too bad though.
All in all not the best \"walk off the street\" meal I've ever had but wouldn't mind giving them another shot with more information about the place.
The charcuterie boards looked great and the fondue looked fun as well. 
Maybe another time Carens."}
{"text":"This is hard for me because the original Carens is one of my all time favourites and I was beyond excited to see the new location open so close to my house. I have gone three times since it opened, and resisted posting my review hoping it was a fluke but it has to be said. 

+ve:

- wine list is good with some nice choices in each category.  Not as long or varied as I expected but have been happy with each selection. 
- food quality is high and seeing the tar tar, mac and the french onion soup on the menu makes me happy. 
- steak frite is well done. 

-ve: 

- service is terrible. Like really bad. Friendly but totally frazzled. I mean empty wine glasses and ignored tables and generally totally disorganized. On one visit they left the credit card machine and just didn't come back for 15 mins. We almost left without paying. On another I ordered a glass of red to go with my steak and it didn't arrive until I had finished my meal. Had to remind them multiple times to bring drinks or food we had ordered and in a group one poor friend just didn't get her main while we all had ours. 
- too fishy. I would guess that 60% of the menu has some sort of seafood. Works well if you are in the mood, but wish there were a few more options. 
- no liquor licence on the patio. Huh?  I am sure they will try to resolve that. 
- no cheese!!  Their other place has some of the best cheese and charcuterie in the city and they just had three to chose from. 
- not open for lunch or on Mondays. They totally misunderstand the Summerhill crowd. We live lunch and afternoon wine. Just look at Terroni's!!  Always busy. We want local places on Monday nights. 

LPC was fun and I will miss them, but Carens has the potential to pick up their game. Need a new manager to drill the servers in to shape and some menu tweak and I think they could thrive. I'll be rooting for them."}
{"text":"My experience here was terrible, due to the server. I should preface this by stating that I've been a server on and off for 20+ years. Our server surprised me. Not that she is old, but she is not a 20 something who has little experience, and she did something that in and of itself wasn't horrific, but it put me in an uncomfortable position: my friend and I ordered 1/2 dozen oysters each. Strangely enough, I was eager to have my own little ice-filled tray of mollusks. When the oysters came, the server said \"I took the liberty of putting the oysters on one tray. Is that ok?\" (I'm paraphrasing. She might have said \"hope that's ok.\")  For me, it wasn't ok, and I offer no explanation for why it wasn't ok.  And I was uncomfortable to say so at the table. But I did, and the server very swiftly lifted the tray, muttering that she'd have it changed. I yelled after her not to do that, and I had to call her back TWICE, as though she didn't hear me the first time. Now, when you're at a restaurant and two people at a table order the same salad, or say, on a wing night, order two orders of the same-sauce wings, does the server presume that these things should be put on the same plate?  Nope. Never in my dining days, and that is the point. As I wrote already, it wasn't horrific, but other aspects of the service were lacking (no side plates for the bread), and the server made me feel like I was a BITCH. When I went through my wallet much later and found my receipt with Caren's on it, I only recalled the crummy experience with what I perceived to be a stuck up server."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Portion size are smaller than your usual but I didn't mind. Ate from the prix fix menu - I chose the potato & leek soup, roasted salmon and mango & strawberry sorbet and all were just fantastic! Kudos to the chef!!! However, service lacked and allergies were not taken seriously (from our long dark haired waitress). I specially asked for no bell peppers in any of my food and she said she'd tell the chef and it appeared twice on my main. Dessert came, she checked up on us and then had the gull to joke about if there were any bell peppers in it. Not impressed by her at all. Service all around needs to be addressed. Great food but not sure I'd go back if service is not equally as great."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is still open is beyond me. I have been here twice now, and both experiences were negative from start to finish. But after my most recent experience, I will definitely not be going back. My friend and I were ignored from the moment we arrived at Caren's. First by the hostess, who after walking past us several times, finally decided to acknowledge us. Not with a hello or how are you or sorry for the wait, but by growling \"reservation?\", as if we were some great inconvenience for patronizing the restaurant.

It did not get better. After being seated and waiting 15 minutes without water or menus, we were delighted to once again be acknowledged, this time by our waiter. We ordered wine, a cheese plate, mac & cheese (apparently their specialty) and the steak tartare. I have not worked in a restaurant, but I am inclined to believe that it does not take 45 minutes to plate pieces of cut up cheese. Only at Caren's. After half an hour of waiting we inquired about the status of our cheese plate. We were told it would be another '60 seconds' (at Caren's this translates to 15 minutes, as we would soon learn). After once again asking where it was (it is just cut up cheese after all), we were told that it was a new cook's first night (I was not aware that cheese required cooking), so the kitchen was delayed. Interestingly this was the same excuse that they gave me in October when I first tried this Caren's Rosedale location. After we received our cheese plate, we waited another 20 minutes for the mac & cheese and steak tartare. When they finally arrived we noticed that we had gotten a little more than we bargained for on the mac & cheese, a big black hair. It had to go back. We waited again. The steak tartare, which came recommended by the server, was bland and the texture was as if it had been through a food processor. The mac & cheese arrived back to the table looking very burnt on top (I assume they plucked the hair out and stuck it in a broiler). We were skeptical and at that point had eaten nearly an entire baguette during our long wait so we hardly touched it. 

The management and kitchen staff of this place are a mess. Go to this restaurant if you like slow, apathetic service and bland, uninspired 'French' food. There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"I went for brunch and ordered the eggs Benedict which came with either your choice of peameal ham or smoked salmon for $16. I ordered the salmon. The waiter told me they were out of salmon that day but had lobster instead would that be OK ?  I said sure. The eggs arrived with probably a tablespoon size of lobster on each muffin with a few home fries and a small plain green salad. Oh well. I had 2 mimosas a that Were half full.  So about 4 ounces with hopefully half orange juice and half sparkling wine. Then I got the bill - the replaced eggs Benedict with smell o lobster was a whopping $32.  When I questioned the waiter, he just shrugged and said lobster is expensive. I think when a replacement is suggested you assume that it is in the same price range but twice the amount and again for the serving size was crazy. The dish with the two mini mimosas came to $68! That's one pricey breakfast. Sorry Caren's  I just can't give you my business with those types of practices."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience last night at Caren's.  

Details:
-Had a 7PM reso for Saturday night, 3 people. First member of our party arrived and was told we didn't have a reso. The same thing happened when I arrived a few minutes later. 
-Initially seated in back room then told to switch tables
-Not clear who our server was (interacted with a total of 4 servers over the course of the evening)
-Very poor service - probably the worst I've experienced in Toronto. Had to ask multiple times for water refills. Food dropped off at table but server never asked how it was. Requested ketchup multiple times from two different servers. Never offered dessert/coffee. Waited a long time for bill and then to pay. Waited a very long time for our jackets to be brought up from coat room after paying. 

The service was so bad, by the end of the night there was nothing we could do but laugh. (In fact we were surprised when they brought up the correct jackets.) The restaurant appeared to be severely understaffed (there was a large party in the back area) but Caren's should have considered closing the entire restaurant for the event - they obviously couldn't handle the number of customers in the restaurant. 

I was particularly disappointed since I'd chosen Caren's for a special dinner with an out-of-town guest. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Chose Carens for my anniversary dinner. We wanted good cheese fondue, wine and nice atmosphere to enjoy ourselves. It couldn't have been any better - they had a pianist playing jazzy/bossa tunes, food was outstanding and even the dessert wine selection was pretty reasonable - their maître is Portuguese and very knowledgeable about wines."}
{"text":"Caren's Yorkville used to be one of my favourite brunch and wine bars in the city. It's a shame they had to close. 

I visited Caren's Rosedale the other day and the service was friendly and quick. The sangria was delicious as always, and the brunch and cheese were tasty. 

My only problem was we often had to ask for things. For example, we got the mascarpone french toast, and it didn't come with mascarpone. We had to awkwardly ask for it and he said \"Oh is there not any on it?\" well.... we wouldn't ask if there was.

Then, when we got the cheese, it came with grapes. My friend is allergic to grapes, so we asked for something else. My friend asked for apples. The server responded with \"apples AND strawberries???\" And we were like umm okay. A little odd, but we ignored it. We had also asked for walnuts and honey, but we never received it. 

The bill came and not only did the apples and strawberries cost extra, it was absurdly priced. $3 for a few slices of apples and $5 for less than a handful of strawberries? Super odd. Funny how our waiter heard \"strawberries\" which nobody asked for, but didn't give us the walnuts and honey that we DID ask for. 

We still tipped generously because we like the establishment, but this weird technique of up-selling on fruit was off putting."}
{"text":"Pros; ambiance, piano player, steak, mac and cheese
Cons; none 


Great experience. Overall, I loved it. I first went a few weeks ago, the atmosphere is exquisite and an excellent interior design. My partner and I ended up being one of few couples in the restaurant as we decided to have a late dinner. To our pleasant surprise, there was a live (exceptional) pianist playing while we sat in a cozy booth over a glass of wine. The staff made us feel like we were regulars, very warm despite it being my first time. Had one of the best flank steaks in Toronto and a fantastic array of cheese. I couldn't have felt like I had a more romantic, delicious, and excellent Saturday date night. 5 stars. Can't wait to go back."}
