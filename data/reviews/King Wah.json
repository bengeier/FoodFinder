{"text":"Another excellent meal. We always get the family dinner. We love the pork lo mein. It's the best around."}
{"text":"I'll start by noting that the food is overpriced for the taste/quality. You get a good portion (if you're ordering for 2) but it's not appetizing for Chinese food. 

The service was not helpful at all, especially given that it was my fist time at their restaurant. I went there because of the reviews but I doubt I'll go back and definitely wouldn't recommend! F!!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. We've never been unhappy with any food from this place. It's our favorite within driving distance of Fairview. The Hunan chicken is my favorite. Lunch prices are a little more reasonable than dinner in my opinion. Very clean inside."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the Cleveland area. As others have said the Chinese options in Lakewood are disappointingly weak but King Wah is worth the short drive to Rocky River! The food always tastes fresh, from the bright crunchy veggies to the tender meat.

A recent outing: The girlfriend and I went shortly before St. Patrick's day this icy winter. They had a special appetizer of corned beef eggrolls with sauerkraut and thousand island, and we both agreed they were some of the most amazing things we have tasted in years. Not what you'd expect from a Chinese place, but they nailed it anyway.

My GF ordered the Lettuce Wraps, which were crunchy and delicious. They might work better with the tortilla-type wrappers though, because iceberg lettuce is just too wet. She ended up eating most of it with a fork, but that was no disappointment.

I got the Orange Beef, which was fantastic. I usually hesitate to get beef (especially fried) but I was cutting this with a fork and it melted in my mouth. There was plenty for leftovers too.

We've been there numerous other times. The GF would probably rate it a 4, but I give a solid 5. Service has always been prompt & friendly and my food has always been excellent. The only bad mark I can think of is that the parking lot is a bit cramped for Friday or Saturday evenings; last time I had to wait in the street for 5 minutes with my hazards on while old people figured out how to pull out of the lot.

Don't Bother: The General Tso and Mu Shu are nothing special. The menu has better items.

Do Try: Hong Kong Sizzling Beef and Chicken, Orange Beef, Szechuan Chicken, or Yellow Curry."}
{"text":"Standard calorie-laden Chinese food, decent service, HUGE portions (one plate is enough for 3 meals, for me), lots of alcohol selections available.  Nothing exciting to make you stand up and cheer, but a good option to have available, especially this far out in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy this restaurant for Chinese food over take out any day. The food is delicious and the people are nice. It's a great place for a family meal."}
{"text":"Pros: Well above average Chinese perfect for those Asian cravings.  LARGE portions, friendly employees, 15 minute take-out time.  Highly recommend Chicken Lo-Mein and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Fresh veggies used in every dish.

Cons: assured high caloric and salt content.  Can be very busy on random days."}
{"text":"Huge portion, but not really tasteful.
Not authenticated Chinese food either.

Price is kind of high compare to other places.
Dinning room look HORRIBLE, the colors and the styles are all looked ugly.

I will rather go somewhere else for a more authenticated chinese food."}
{"text":"Though the parking lot is small, this restaurant makes up for it tenfold with the beautiful decor and design. Elegant, yet not cramped or stuffy like most Chinese restaurants. Service was delightful, very friendly and prompt. Tea has a good flavor, and served boiling hot as it should be. Mom ordered moo goo gai pan, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Said the wonton soup was the best she's had in ages.
I ordered the vegetable egg roll and schezwuan eggplant. Egg roll was well seasoned and crispy, served with a nice sweet and sour sauce and some other sauce that while spicy, had no other flavor. Eggplant was cooked to perfection and sauce was flavorful and hot. All in all an excellent lunch. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and years, and I can honestly say that I have only ever had one truly bad meal here. I just read some truly dismal reviews of this place, and I don't get it at all. I guess everyone has a bad day...
If you are looking for an authentic chinese meal, i.e. \"real\" chinese food, you won't find it here, and they will gladly admit that. If what you are looking for is classic American style Chinese food with better ingredients and a nice atmosphere, you will be quite happy.
Depending on what day/time you choose to go, it can be quite busy, and the crowd in the foyer area waiting for takeout orders during dinner rush can be a little chaotic.
The food? Classic Chinese American, like Moo Goo Gai Pan, Szechuan Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Ornage Chicken, etc., with what I consider to be the best Hot and Sour soup on the west side of Cleveland. If you are used to cheap Chinese takeout, the versions of those dishes served here are fresher, and better prepared renditions. They are also more expensive.
On my last visit, I had Teriyaki beef skewers (I know, not Chinese at all) which were meaty, large and tender. We shared fried potstickers which I find to be superior to many others I have tried elsewhere. My 6 year old is obsessed with potstickers, and we've had them at quite a few places and these are her favorite. I learned on this last visit that they do not make them in house, but purchase what they feel are the best.
They had a Mei Fun noodle dish with shrimp, pork and chicken that was accented with Chinese pickled cabbage which was a peasant surprise, a little different and it kind of made my day. The Szechuan eggplant was great, as were the soups, as always.
In all the years I have been coming here, I have seen the same faces at the door, in the dining room (one waitress has waited on me at least half of the times I have been there). It is always very clean, everyone is always friendly and gracious. I can't say the same for other Chinese restaurants in the area.
Yes, it's more expensive. For my daughter, her mom and myself it was almost $50 plus tip (so $60). That was for two entrees, 2 bowls of soup, two appetizers and a pot of tea. It seems like a lot, but we took at least half of it home for another meal, and none of it was greasy or half assed, and it was served with style.
SO, if all you want is some takeout and the usual overseasoned brown sauce sticky junk, go to some dragon-palace-china-city-china-chef strip mall place. nothing wrong with that. This is a little better, and I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"An unexpected gem on Center Ridge Road. Connie makes amazingly strong, sweet cocktails served in ceramic coconuts! I have had the Pad Thai and Szechwan Eggplant (with broccoli!) on separate occasions. The Szechwan sauce is on point and the added broccoli was cooked just right, still green with a little crunch. You can tell this restaurant is a community fave by just standing in the waiting area or at the bar for a few minutes. There is a constant stream of takeout during the evening. We really appreciate their late hours."}
{"text":"Our first time here, we stopped in for lunch. It was ok.  I liked the numerous lunch specially priced options, but they are really heavy on the sauce and the fried rice left much to be desired. My husband ordered the sesame chicken and we were expecting a crunchy and slightly sweet honey dish. Not the case here. It was drowning in a brown sauce and the sweet & sour-esque vegetables (peppers and onions) overpowered the entire dish with undesired results. Just because you throw some sesame seeds on top doesn't make it sesame chicken!

The second time we placed a $45 order to go: for two dishes and an appetizer!?! While everything was packed nicely for transport, again, really heavy on the sauce. I ordered a vegetable dish and they were floating in a brown fish/oyster sauce. Just not good. Sesame chicken still disappointing. The only saving grace to the meal was their take on PF Chang's chicken lettuce wraps. A poorish substitute, but the only Changers in Cleveland is too far(on the eastside). 

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Still on the look out for awesome Chinese on the westside!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese...if you are looking for Chinese food, you cannot pass this up.  Service is fantastic, portions are enough for a meal plus a doggy bag, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time earlier this week and we had a great meal. The vegetables were fresh. The meat was juicy. The sauces were good but in some regard a little too Americanized. The portions were good but not too much.The wonton was excellent, the crab rangoon and egg rolls were just average at best. 

I found the service to be very good and attentive, the restaurant itself was very clean, including the restroom. 

I disagree with another review regarding the parking. We came at dinner time and the parking was very adequate and convenient.

I would certainly go back again. 

The pricing for the quality I thought was very fair."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday  night at 7:30 pm to get carry out out we'd called in. Waited for more than 5 minutes for the gal with the long black hair tending bar to acknowledge us. She said \"no, that's not your carry out\" and walked away. The customer in front of us in line was disappointed that her  order was not filled as expected. The older gentleman employee insisted she'd called  it in incorrectly - and and walked away in A huff. A guy standing behind me in line says \"I'm a regular here and have never seen such rudeness here by employees.\" The three of us nodded and commented that we
Hoped the regular staff was on vacation. I'd brought a friend visiting from out of town and was sincerely embarrassed."}
{"text":"I picked up dinner from here because the reviews were generally good on yelp. I ordered sweet and sour chicken and brown rice. I liked that they had a brown rice option. The portion was large and sauce was nice with the vegetables but the chicken was dry and tough and I barely ate it but a few bites. I probably won't keep the rest for leftovers either."}
{"text":"This by far the BEST Chinese food out there!!!!
We drive 45 minutes to get here and have never been disappointed.
Big portuons, REAL chicken flavor is spot on!!
Trust me it is worth the drive!!!
Love this place! I dare you to find a better place!!"}
{"text":"Typical dated but clean Cantonese restaurant.  Friendly staff enhances the dining out experience.  Lunch menu had a large selection of reasonably priced specials that come with soup or egg roll and rice.  My wonton soup had a light tasty broth and fresh slices of roast pork, bok choy and scallions.  One nicely filled dumpling instead of two skimpy ones with too much wrapper would have been better.  Also, the fried rice was nothing but rice sauteed with a bit of egg. I'd skip it. Wor Shu Gai, on the other hand, a decadent dish of breaded chicken over lettuce with a brown gravy totally satisfied the craving for this Chinese American dish found mainly in the mid-West."}
{"text":"We had the pot-stickers app & kung pao chicken with fried rice. It was really good. They can make the \"hot\" items as hot as you want. Very nice service. Terrible parking lot."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a business trip. I had to get staff attention to be seated, but I will attribute that to poor space layout. If you walk in, don't stop at the sign unless someone acknowledges you...it is unlikely you'll be seen.
I have rounded up my review from 3.5 stars. The food was OK, the portion sizes not overflowing, which is good for me, but the service was definitely lacking. I was seated, my order taken, my drink and food delivered, then I was not visited again until I hailed a passing staff member for my check. The food was a bit heavy on the sauce, but the vegetables were perfectly cooked and crispy and not mushy as they often are in Chinese food. I would probably eat here again as it is quick and offers a good value."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat! Service was great, as well as the food. Manager stopped by our table several times to see how everything was. A little pricey, and no combo dinners. Have to pay $6.50 extra for that. Had a young child running around the restaurant while the parents were drinking at the bar."}
{"text":"Great Food!! Loved the Pad Thai Noodles, Garlic Chicken and shrimp and the spring rolls rock!"}
{"text":"The worst service. Since this place is the only Chinese takeout in the area we gave this place two try's in hopes that perhaps the first time was an isolated incident. However each time was we went the service and food were consistent. Consistently awful. 
The manager is extremely rude. He literally threw my credit card back at me after I submitted it for payment. 

The food is really awful. I would rather go downtown or to any takeout place other than this place if I wanted Chinese. 

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I usually have a lot (too much, actually) to say about my Chinese food. I'll just leave my usual wordiness out and say that this is delicious. And although we got everything to go, I would love to dine in. It's rare to find an actual Chinese restaurant as opposed to just a tiny takeout joint. It was cute inside and reminded me of the old Chinese restaurants on Avenue U in Brooklyn. Old-fashioned, but with really nice service.

Food was great. They have brown rice as an option. Egg rolls are the bomb. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Consistently Good Food.

I have been a patron of this restaurant for 20+ years because we have consistently eaten great meals from this place. We usually do takeout a couple of times a month. I think it's the best Chinese restaurant on the westside of Cleveland. We love their Pad Thai which is very flavorful. Their other dishes such as the Sweet and Sour Chicken and General Tso's are equally delicious. Plus they don't skimp out on their meats and the veggies are always fresh. Their sauces are very tasty. We always ask for extra sauce and get it at no charge. I highly recommend this establishment for sit down or takeout. You can't go wrong either way."}
{"text":"i wish i could give 1/2 star reviews as I feel King Wah falls at 3.5 stars. I'd say it was better than OK, but I'm not clamoring to get back there again. 
the pictures of the food on Yelp! looked great and the reviews are all pretty good so Danielle and i decided to try it out. i definitely liked it more than she did. 
she got Singapore noodles. she said the noodles had a weird \"coating\" on them. i'm not sure what she was talking about. she might be certifiably nuts for all i know. i tried them and didn't notice anything weird. i don't even know what the word \"coating\" means in this context.
i had the King Wah Special Szechwan which was not terribly spicy (i could have maybe used a bit more kick). i also had a vegetable egg roll. my food was good and i ate all of it. 
we shared an appetizer of crab rangoon which neither of us cared too much for. 
a couple negatives from my perspective:
  - the bar was real close to the dining area and the people drinking at the bar were loud and obnoxious - as if it was just a regular neighborhood dive.
  - the bathrooms were insanely small. 
i'd go again, but i don't think D would be into it. You never know."}
{"text":"Food is great - all of it, recommend the sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls and wonton soup. The service is so friendly!! Connie is great, called us by name."}
{"text":"Best Americanized Chinese food in the area. Love the egg rolls and their homemade sweet & sour sauce!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing chinese food! There has been nothing on the menu that I have not been in love with. For a real treat, order your take out at the bar (or eat in) and have Connie make you a drink! Highly recommend her mai tais, or if you aren't flying solo, the volcano. Have a DD if you plan on having more than I drink!

I would recommend: General Tso's chicken, pork fried rice, egg foo young, wonton soup, and crab rangoon!

Service is fast, friendly, and they make you feel like a valued customer. I keep venturing out to other places, and come right back! King Wah is my home base for delicious chinese food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Comfort Chinese food for local Rocky River residents, King Wah serves solid Chinese food - way better than Mark Pi's - at a reasonable price.  The staff is friendly, and the food itself is decent if not exceptional; it's a cut above what most Chinese food places offer, but not as spectacular as some of the gourmet place.  

For all that, we eat here about twice a month.  When we want Chinese, this is where we go."}
{"text":"I have a confession. 

Next year (ironically exactly 1 year from today) I will be marrying an honest to goodness real-live Asian. 100% Taiwanese and guess what, his parent's even owned a Chinese restaurant in Atlanta while he was growing up. He is the real deal Holyfield. And he is marrying and Italian-American who prefers her Chinese food (gasp!) Americanized. 
THE HORROR! 

Yes, I love me some sesame chicken. And Szechwan chicken. And if I'm feeling a little frisky I might even order me up some Sweet & Sour chicken. And I consider pineapple chunks a bonus, not a disgrace! 
And this is why I am a fan of King Wah. The meats and vegetables are fresh, the pot stickers are homemade and oh so yummy, and the sauces are delicious even if they are considered \"dumbed down\" for people like me. And news flash, there are plenty of people out there just...like...me. 
So yes, King Wah serves mostly Americanized Chinese food. And they have also been doing it for almost 40 years so that tells me its working for them. Keep on keepin on, King Wah!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants.  The food and service are excellent.  The decor is very nice.  Try the soup for two.  The prices are a little higher but worth it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like this place. However, I have noticed that the quality of food is inconsistent and has gone down hill lately. Some locals say that it depends on the chef of the day, so it's a gamble. But let me say that the wonton soup is the best ever. I have yet to find somewhere that has better soup than King Wah. It's that wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was decent here. I ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice and egg roll. The sesame chicken was good. I like how this place uses white meat chicken and it's lightly breaded. Other places use way to much breading and you eat very little actual chicken. The egg roll was good too. However, the fried rice needs some work. It was dry. All it had was a little egg in it and that's it. No veggies, no pork, no seasoning. It wasn't the best. Work on the rice and the food would be great. Right now it was just average. The atmosphere is ok. I like that the place has a small bar in the front (didn't order any drinks so I am not sure how good the drinks are). The server was really nice but a bit slow. Where was the soy sauce? We weren't given any and the rice surely needed it! Overall, it is a decent place to eat but there are better places. Worth a try for sure..."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and never tried it until a friend told me that is the only place she gets Chinese food from because it is the cleanest. Tonight I ordered shrimp fried rice to go and while I thought it would be good, it turned out beyond great and King Wah you deserve a high five and a super awesome review. See you soon ;)"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Food didn't sit well the next day at all! Just called and talked to manager and he claimed it wasn't because of their food. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Really great food and reasonable prices. The only complaint I have is the fact that on two occasions now the waiter/waitress doesn't listen to the order; it's insulting. Normally I'd say it's a language barrier but I don't think that's the case. I believe it's an excuse. Either way, I enjoyed the meal and once you make triple sure they heard (not understood) you it's fine."}
{"text":"Very very good food! Pupu platter was to die for! Very classy inside. Only reason why I don't rate 5 stars is because the waiter/waitress  to costumer communication. They didn't completely understood English."}
{"text":"the fried rice is dry. the lo mein is good. the general tso's is served with red and green peppers, so takes on the flavor of those. the orange chicken was good. the pieces of chicken are huge, but kinda dry. the chicken egg rolls are good too. it was a mixed bag. might try it again."}
{"text":"Simply the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland area.  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is the go to for westside chinese take out. But if you want to have a nice little sit down dinner, they also have a nice area for that. The pad thai is great, as is most things we have ordered there. 
I think the prices are a little high, but it's tasty for sure."}
{"text":"Not bad.. not memorable. Some what bland for  phad Thai. Gravy on the egg for young was nice. I am on a quest to find the legendary egg rolls of  Golden Buddha fame from westlake. Please someone find egg rolls that compare. Tonight's were not crispy and they were bland and stringy. The hot mustard was even runny and bland. You could inhale without loosing your breath, like all hot mustard lovers look for. The shrimp in all dishes were large and fresh. Again not bad but not memorable."}
{"text":"Was fairly unhappy. Service wasn't the best and they didn't really explain certain things to us when we asked, and came off fairly rude when we would ask certain questions about the menu.. One thing that stood out was it seems like they almost try to trick you into buying more that what is offered. One of our usual stops includes the Wonton in the dinner menu, this one they asked me what soup I would like with my meal, instead of asking if I would like one with it, which hints that it is included in the price. Nope.   Would most likely avoid this place again."}
{"text":"I have been going to King Wah for a VERY long time. I love the beef and broccoli, which has a delicious sauce. Hot and Sour soup is also great. 
One of the waitresses, Jen, has been working there for 30 years, and she is always very professional and friendly. So is the manager, who will always come around to check on your comfort. 
I love King Wah. If you haven't been there, definitely give it a try! You are missing something special!"}
{"text":"New to the Rocky river area I've only eaten here 3 times but every time has been fresh and perfectly cooked. Takeout is always quick and service very friendly. The orange chicken wasn't too saucy and the vegetables were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"The people sitting at the very tiny bar always seem to be lost in the wrong time zone.
Maybe it's because they hang out at a tiny bar in a Chinese restaurant?
But the food here is very good.
Probably some of the best Chinese food on Cleveland's west side.
Four stars, and an egg roll thumbs up for King Wah."}
{"text":"Having a delicious dinner on the way home from the office at King Wah and Connie, The best bartender in America gets a take out call at 9:59; they close at 10 and take the order with a smile without a hesitation. Where else? Order the general and a Mai Tai. Best chinese food"}
{"text":"Disappointing and overpriced. Szechuan Chicken was bland. Potstickers greasy and under seasoned. Noodles dry. Won't eat there again."}
{"text":"There are so few great sit-down Chinese places left that it behooves you to get your butt into this place and try it out.  Their food is really great.  We had their 3rd annual \"St. Patrick's Day corned beef egg rolls\".  I loved them, but my wife said \"eh, they were ok\".  Also had King Wah Delight and cashew chicken.  Both really good!  Service is friendly and helpful, and the bar actually seemed like a fun place to sit a spell.  Prices are good, but they can't compete with the take outee places on price.  That said, if you haven't been to an eat in Chinese place, this one should be your first.  King Wah forever!"}
{"text":"Had sesame beef and orange chicken and both were great. My kids liked them as so everyone was happy and well fed."}
{"text":"We got King Wah takeout tonight. 
I feel there are limited acceptable Chinese takeout options in the Cleveland area, so King Wah is my go-to.

My Order:
- Kung Pao Chicken: This is heavy on peanuts. It says in the menu it is \"spicy\", but don't worry - it's not really spicy. I like that the chicken pieces are bigger. The mushrooms surprised me. Came with steamed rice which tasted like... steamed rice. Perfect.
- Wanton Soup: Best wanton noodles in town. Hands down. 
- Egg Roll: Crispy on the outside, salty and delicious on the inside. Goes great with wanton soup.
- Crab Rangoon: This is my favorite appetizer. Sometimes the outside isn't as crispy as I'd like, but 9 out of 10 times absolutely perfect.

Overall, a great option for the Westside of Cleveland if you're looking for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Had not been here in a decade or more when we had lunch today.
Pot Stickers: Meh. Standard, run-of-the-mill, blah sauce. Disappointing.
Entrees: Szechwan Eggplant was delicious. Fresh vegetables, excellent Chinese eggplant, a bit on the saucy side. General Tso's Chicken was a bit dry, and also over-sauced, but very good.
They charge $1 for brown rice, which is a bit annoying.
Overall,  this is definitely a cut above the unfortunate plethora of sub-standard takeout places. (We'd' still choose Pearl of the Orient first, though.)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Extremely courteous service! Must visit and must have sizzling rice soup!"}
{"text":"I've been in RR a year and a half now, but I just recently decided to see what the area had to offer for Chinese. I stopped by late on Sunday and the parking lot only had a few empty spaces. Once inside there was a constant stream of people picking up their take-out. Connie who works the front/bar area is well known by the customers and often had friendly greetings for them. After I ordered my wait time was about 15-20 minutes even with them being so busy. 

For food I got the Sesame Chicken $13 (rounding up here) turned into a combo dinner for an extra $6. This included wonton soup, one rib, one jumbo fried piece of shrimp, and one egg roll. I also got a side of the Crab Rangoons for $6, I think there were 8 of them. So my total came to $25. I thought this was a little pricey, but I ended up getting 3 meals out of it. 

Downside is that I felt meh about the food. When I think of Chinese food I think of the stuff that is so bad for you but oh so good. It's cheap and will make you feel bloated the next day, but you have no regrets. It's also a requirement that you eat this stuff in your sweatpants. King Wah seemed like it tried to be a little fancier but came up short. The chicken was not crispy fried chunks of tasty questionable mystery meat coated in delicious sauce, instead it barely had a bread coating on it, the chicken was all white meat, but way too many pieces contained that hard cartilage/stringy vein stuff that you're supposed to cut out and throw away. Plus it looked so sad drowning in all that sauce, luckily (sarcasm) though it had hard chunks of vegetables to cling to. The fried rice that came with it was sad and plain with just a few bits of egg mixed in. Nothing else. 

I did really like the bbq rib, and there was a tiny side of this pineapple sauce that I dipped my shrimp in that was tasty. The egg roll seemed to be of a decent size and the taste was standard. Wonton soup was okay as well. The crab rangoons though were a little plain, but you can never go that wrong with fried dough and cream cheese. 

Overall the food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't what I was expecting or craving. I guess I just prefer my Chinese take-out to have low standards. I shall continue my search!"}
{"text":"\"To go forward you must go back...\"

If I had only known that Li Wah (downtown) and Ho Wah (east side) had a sister restaurant on the west side, I would've been here long before now.  I have eaten at the other two establishments many times when I was an east-sider, and have been struggling to find quality Chinese on this side of town for a couple of years.  I think the search is over.

Came here for lunch on a Tuesday, and even though it was about five after eleven, they were still setting up.  Not the best first impression, but I decided to stick around.  They did seat me after a minute or so, and I had a drink and a bowl of soup before they had finished their set-up.  I will also admit that the hot and sour soup was a bit disappointing - was not dark brown in color, and tasted very bland.  However, the General Tsos may be the best I have had since moving to Cleveland over 15 years ago.  White meat, perfectly fried, and with a nice assortment of veggies.  The egg roll was good, as well.

Finally."}
{"text":"Meh- I totaly knew what I was getting into. I was with who is now an ex girlfriend friend who did not feel good and just wanted to get out of the car and not be near people, Joe's Deli is what I was craving but the lady pretty much made it all but impossible to satisfy my craving . I found the closest Chinese place, since they have a knack for having food ready before you pick it up.

Yeah I know it was going to be about 10:00 for something in a think brown sauce  with some garlic and if I am lucky a little heat.

I got the Hunan beef extra spicy with no broccoli. broccoli and I do not  get along, oh well : (    They asked what I wanted besides broccoli, I asked for some baby corns or chinese broccoli.  They said they did not have those. I was like hmm I you have some u-choy or something.  So I said how about some peapods, they said sure. 
I arrive to pick up my Americanized brown sauce goodness and they charge me a 1$ more cause pea-pods are more expensive.  Well that my friends is the best way to keep me from giving you my money the next time.  Just nickel and dime me and  for sure will not come back.  

I get to her house and  I find I have an order of pepper  steak with a few peapods I take a bite and it is a sweet brown sauce with no flavor, The meat was pretty chewy. Not what I had ordered. Tried a couple of more bites it did not get any better..
I  took it back and they refunded my money with out a problem. The were nice about it as well. Good service if I can come up with a positive.

{"text":"I had heard about King Wah from my husbands best friend for a few years now.  We typically have our favorites as far as Chinese restaurants go.  One evening the hubs and I decided to give King Wah a try.  Some folks may say they are slightly overpriced...my argument to that is, you get what you pay for.  Of all the dishes we have tried, our absolute, hands down favorite is the Thai Basil Chicken...soooo freaking good!  I find myself craving it.  We are looking forward to possibly trying their sister restaurants in the near future."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST Chinese restaurant on the west side. Not only are they excellent for take-out, but they also have a large sit down part and bar! I normally get the the Sezwhuan chicken with white rice and Spring Rolls (BEST MEAL EVER). I have also tried other numerous items i highly recommend... Chicken Fired Rice, Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Chicken and Broccoli, Won Ton Soup and Hot and Sour, the ribs and the Egg Rolls are the BEST in CLE. 

If you do have time, I highly recommend having a sit down dinner there, not only do you get way more food, but the service and ambiance is exceptional!"}
{"text":"If your looking for classic Chinese American with an more upscale dining experience this is the place. Food is average nothing to exciting, different or that would really stand out as a must order. But the atmosphere is definitely not typical of most Chinese American restaurant and that gives this place a leg up on the rest. Owner is almost always in and managing with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"As the menu states, this is gormet Chinese food, and as I may add, at it's finest. Best Chinese food in Cleveland, let alone best I've ever had. Decor is so inviting and warm, makes you feel extremely comfortable. The service is great, you truly feel like you are being served. Our waiter was professional and right on cue. The won ton soup or however you spell it is awesome, the flavor is just out of this world. You have to try it! The egg rolls are pricey but worth it. Loved the chicken egg roll. 
I had the orange chicken which was amazing! Dad had caschew chicken which was also amazing. The food is great quality, you can tell this is authentic Chinese food that is good for you. 
For 3 people who had: drinks, soup, egg rolls and two entrees, the bill was about $55. So worth it, I highly recommend this for nice meal out! A ton of people do take out too, which I also have done :)"}
{"text":"Terrific Chinese food and very popular. King Wah does a huge take-out business, but the eating-in experience is very nice as well.  The regular menu is standard Chinese fare, tasty and well-done, but very familiar.  There are some more interesting items on the chef's special menu, of a Chinese-American variety.  This is not a place to go to have your palate challenged; it's comfort food Chinese, and well done for that."}
{"text":"This place has the best service around! After going one time, the owners knew me by name and greeted me by name every time I walked in. I didn't go often, maybe 3 times a year, so it was impressive they knew me by name. In addition, they knew my order off the top of their head when I called in...equally impressive. I have never had better service. The owner got to know me and consistently asked me how I was doing and what was going on in my life. 

In addition to excellent service, the food is terrific. I absolutely love the orange chicken and the general tso's.  I haven't tried the restaurant for sit down service, so I can't comment on that. 

The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the prices are a little steep.  If the prices weren't so high, I would be inclined to go back more often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The quality of meat and produce is nearly unmatched! I love the chow mein!"}
{"text":"The family that owns this restaurant also owns Li Wah, so it's no surprise that the food is delicious! The menu is large and a little on the pricey side, but worth it!"}
{"text":"King Wah is my absolute go-to for Chinese food. I love this place for many reasons but most of all for the taste of the food and the overall aesthetic and service. 

I am very picky about Chinese food and any take-out food. The thing I love the most is that this is a stand alone restaurant...not a storefront. The decor is beautiful and they service you similar to many of your favorite sit-down eateries. 

The food is amazing! The flavor is great! My favorites are the pu pu platter, Green beans and the lo mein. Don't forget to use some of their homemade duck sauce (orange sauce). It's seriously amazing. 

Everyone is friendly here. Also, the servers are very much educated about the dishes.  I've never experienced long wait times for a table. 

The prices are great! The food is high quality so I'd expect the prices to be higher but they are reasonable. 

I highly suggest trying out the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food!  Won Ton Soup is flavorful and delicious.  Egg rolls could be served a little hotter.  Meats and vegetables are fresh and the sauces are unlike what most other Chinese restaurants serve.  Service was very attentive and there is ample parking.  Although there is something calling itself an outdoor seating area, the dining room is much better.  The background music detracts from the experience somewhat."}
{"text":"I think this place is terrible, from the food to the service it is all bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat the pick up order I placed but this is my first time here and I felt compelled to review. We were driving home from Xmas shopping and so we enlisted Yelp to find a place for food. The parking lot was full, inside bar and tables were full, and people poured in for take out orders. Multiple people came in and knew the bartender by name as did she them. There were even gifts exchanged by patrons and staff. The bartender Connie knew small details of each customer like how many mustards or which wine to pour as they waited for food. Even if our food ends up being lackluster, which I'm sure is far from what it will be based in the mouthwatering pictures from other reviews, the first impression was amazing!!! Looking forward to returning already!!


Edit: food is A+!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing food! We ordered two dishes and got so much food that it was amazing! The food tasted extremely authentic and since I have been to China that means a lot to me!! The staff is extremely nice and helpful. They have just started to use a new computer system so the service was lagging a little bit but the wait for a table was only 15 minutes and it did not take long to get our food at all. The atmosphere  is great for such a small restaurant. I would recommend this hidden cleveland gem to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered the sesame chicken and the chicken was fake breaded puffs of air like a chicken nugget without the chicken! The \"chicken\" was not whole meat pieces cut and breaded. It was minced like a thin layer of fluff along the inside of the breading like a melted cheese stick!  The quality was very poor and I could not eat it.

We were very good customers...unfortunately we will not return."}
{"text":"Food was good! You can definitely tell they don't put MSG on their food. Parking could be better though, whenever I go there, it's really hard to find a spot to park."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent attentive service, fresh ingredients and perfectly prepared food.  Large portions and clean.  A definite go if you like chinese food."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner tonight for takeout.....unusual 40 minute wait. The Orange beef was flavorful and great. The lo mein...was horrible. The noodles were dry and stuck together.  I asked for mushrooms and I got one. I had to add soy at home because there was no sauce. The pork fried rice was white and missing the pork. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Life can't be too bad when you're sipping a mai tai in a faux coconut. You can get American-style Chinese in hundreds of places in Northeast Ohio, but not many serve fanciful tiki drinks to wash down your triple delight. Added points for their above-average Americanized Chinese (lots of very fresh vegetables and solid cooking). And another star for the great service from the proprietors. We sat at the bar and watched an endless stream of customers come in for carryout or a quick bite during our meal. At least half were greeted by name, and they all left happy. It's not fancy or sophisticated, but it's fun and good."}
{"text":"I live in Lakewood, and surprisingly, it is difficult for me to find a good Chinese take-out place.  When it comes to Chinese take-out in the area, everywhere is just so dirty, and...ewe. Well, I gave this place a shot, and I'm glad I did. Note: It is more expensive than the typical Chinese-takeout restaurant. However, I feel better paying a little extra so I can be more comfortable eating my Chinese dinner. 

I typically do not like egg rolls, but I always order at least one. I take a bite or two, and then I can't eat the rest. The egg rolls here are SO GOOD. I was sad I only got one! I also ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice, and while it was skimpy on veggies, it was good.

If I am craving Chinese food again, I'll probably go here because I trust it. This is a place where you can dine it, and I was able to look around while they were getting my order together and it looks very nice. Just a little pricey.

The employees seemed friendly enough. I was greeted right away and while I was waiting another guy asked if I needed anything. They seemed attentive, up until after I paid...I handed back the credit card receipt and the lady wouldn't even look at me and was like okay yeah bye....I kinda wish it had been a little better on the customer service level."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times food was great. Loved the Kung Pao Chicken. The place was packed, so I'm not alone in my opinion. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Can't even begin to express the horrible experience a few friends and I had here. We called in an order for pick up and upon giving our first order they tried to rush us off of the phone when we weren't even close to finishing the order. One of my friends ordered  a wonton soup and general tso's chicken.. When we got to the restaurant it was pouring rain outside and there was not one customer in sight and once again we were rushed out the door.. The poor service was one thing, but after driving 20 mins back home we realized we were missing 3 orders!! We did not get the wonton soup ordered or the General tso's along with a few other things, but I mention these specifically because we called back to complain and explain (at this point we were irritated and over it) and the same rude lady working there said \"you did not order the wonton soup\" ... When we ordered we were pacifically asked if we wanted a small or large wonton soup and we responded with a small so there is no way they did not \"get the order\" it was just purely neglected. Bad service, and messed up orders. Not even worth the trouble."}
{"text":"I'm starting off with parking, it's terrible!
The service is good, but last night was mediocre, younger male server, nice enough, but not what we are used to coming here. Felt rushed. 
The pricing, a bit on the very high side for Chinese food. And pretty much you have to buy things all separately.
The menu reads, you can and this, this and this for 5.95 extra, no worth even it. An egg roll, a fried shrimp and a tiny rib. 
The egg fo young was not hot, was made into huge patties. Typically flatter. The rice wasn't hot either. 
I do not frequent here because of the above but wanted Chinese and my place that I love was too far in the terrible weather we had yesterday. I doubt we will come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Eight Precious Pearl Duck thinking it was a stuffed duck with glutinous rice and pork. Instead I got a pork, chicken, and shrimp stir-fry with sliced duck buried at the bottom. Don't get me wrong I thought it was good, but I was expecting something a lot different."}
{"text":"Good, reasonably priced place.  Dined there New Years eve afternoon and service and food were wonderful.  We ordered food for Christmas eve take out though- big order placed in person.  Food was good but the pick up service was terrible.  There was a huge group of people waiting and they need a much better process.  They were more than a 1/2 hour behind schedule and that was made worse by the order not being checked back in the kitchen, but unpacked and checked at the bar.  Then added up on a calculator before checking you out.  They need a new system if they want to handle big take out nights!  Probably won't order take out again but I'll eat there for sure."}
{"text":"Meh. Maybe 2.5 stars.

I went there because I wanted some Chinese Food and was far too hungry to take the time to journey to E30th.  The food is not terribly authentic or interesting-- just run of the mill Americanized Chinese suffering from an overabundance of \"brown sauce\".  

THE FOOD:  The veggies, chicken and shrimp are of good quality and fresh.  I enjoyed my \"cupid's arrow\" special of shrimp and chicken with green beans in a spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce was the standard brown sauce seasoned with peppers.  My daughter's noodles were a giant undifferentiated lump of congealed starch, dyed brown with soy sauce.  Inedible!  The potstickers were a touch greasy.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  I really miss the 1980s.  So do they, apparently.

THE SERVICE:  The one stand out is the service.  Friendly, fast and pleasant.  Our waitress was so nice and helpful.  She even gave my daughter a tutorial on chopsitcks!

I'll stick to my favorite takeaway when I'm too lazy to journey East."}
{"text":"We've passed this place for years and finally decided to stop.  We were definitely not disappointed.  We began our meal with an appetizer of Crab Rangoon's and they were delicious!  Hubby ordered Pad Thai and I ordered the cashew chicken.  We both enjoyed our dishes immensely and there's plenty for leftovers too!  We were welcomed warmly, seated immediately, had great service, the place was clean, the food was delish. As satisfied customers, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to King Wah for ten years now.  I can say without hesitation that we have never had a bad meal there in all that time.  The King Wah family knows how to cook and serve, and the results are excellent dishes with unique and delicious sauces, fresh vegetables, perfectly cooked shrimp and beef that they marinate to tender perfection.  Just have their Chinese Steak served to you on hot plate and you'll understand.  It's one of their best dishes.  Like something plainer?  How about Shrimp Chop Suey?  Crispy fresh vegetables, jumbo fresh shrimp which is never overcooked, all in a simple but superb white sauce.  Like Hunan sauce?  Try the Hunan Shrimp.  The sauce is terrific.  What we love so much about King Wah is you can order two dark sauces (say Mongolian Beef and Hong Kong Sizzling Beef and Chicken) and be treated to two distinct and delicious sauces cooked consistently well each and every time.  The food quality there is surpassed only by their service and friendliness.  We feel like family there and have come to really care about everyone at King Wah.  Good people, great service and outstanding food."}
{"text":"First time here, party of 5.  Everyone loved their food, our waitress was attentive and the portion sizes were huge.  We all had to take most of our food home.  I was able to turn my meal into 3 meals with the leftovers.  Would not hesitate to come back to King Wah."}
{"text":"Why have I not been getting carry out from here all along? It is so worth the short drive!! Tonight I got the King Wah Egg Foo Young. It was the most fabulous egg foo young I have ever had. I had the soup, the egg roll, and the shrimp chips. Each one was better than the other. Whatever you order will be the best. I can imagine the chef in the kitchen as a real chef, not a hack slinging hash. Go there. Go there right now! But, be careful, because everyone is so excited to get there that the parking in the lot is crazy!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in this area.. food is always delicious, hot and a great presentation. Price point is very nice as well."}
{"text":"Since I live in Rocky River I've eaten at King Wah several times over the years, at the restaurant and carryout. After too many bad experiences and diminished food quality, I will never be a customer of King Wah again. My daughter and I ate their one night and she ordered the Lemon Chicken which, when she cut into it, was obviously pork and not chicken. The final straw was last evening when I called in a take-out order. The woman who answered was borderline rude. Now I talk really fast but this woman was talking so fast and obviously in such a hurry to get me off the phone that I couldn not understand her. I was ordering one soup, two spring rolls, potstickers and two entrees. Each time I would say what I wanted, i.e., \"I'll have one large won ton soup\", she would quickly say, before I even got the word \"soup\" out, \"won ton soup, $4.50 ok that's it\". After every item I ordered and it was not \"is that it?\" it was \"that's it, don't order anyting else\". Of course, when my husband came home with the food, the potstickers were missing, the soup was tasteless and watered down and even though our two entrees could come mild, medium or hot, and I ordered them hot, they were not because she was in such a hurry she either did not hear me or did not care. I was spending $40 on take out food, which was an easy profit for them, but never again. I'll make my own Chinese food before I ever grace their door again."}
{"text":"What's that in my KUNG PAO CHICKEN takeout?

In the large-size black plastic container, I see a beautiful and bright assortment of green pepper and red pepper chunks, nice-sized wedges of large mushrooms, some water chestnut slices, and big plump peanuts, all swimming in an redolently inviting dark brown sauce. m-m-m.

Wait a minute...something's missing.

Green Pepper . . . . check
Red Pepper . . . . . . check
Mushrooms . . . . . . check
Water Chestnuts. . check
Peanuts . . . . . . . . . check

Ah-hah...THERE you are..
With a serving spoon, found the very few pieces of chicken.  (Embarrassed at the poor impression they were making in this namesake dish, they were all hiding underneath.)  The Focal Points.  The Stars of this dish.  The Main Ingredients.  What this is NAMED after---or so I'd always thought.  

Shocking how little chicken was present---much less than the equivalent of a very small breast.  Not nearly enough for even two toddler appetites.  This was as close to a vegetarian dish as I've ever had without specifically ordering vegetarian.  Vegetables were fresh and flavorful...sauce quite delicious with just the right amount of heat...but more like KUNG PAO GREEN PEPPER with a chicken garnish.

Called King Wah.  Now you have to understand what I'm like.  I very rarely complain, and if I do, it's legitimate and not over something trivial, I'm calm, friendly, and never raise my voice.  I've made mistakes in my own kitchen, and understand how things can happen.  I explained the issue, said how good it was otherwise, and must surely have been an oversight.  The man said no problem---the next time I was in, I'd get a half order at no charge.   

At that, a woman suddenly commandeers the phone, wanting to know what the problem was.  I started all over again...was interrupted a \"few\" times.  We went back and forth.  The woman INSISTED that there was \"a lot of chicken\" in it and that she packed it herself (repeated this at least three times.)  I asked her what the normal amount would be.  She had no answer---said she isn't the chef, but wanted to show him so he didn't make the mistake with other orders.  One time she said she saw all the chicken on the top, then another that it all was on the bottom.  (It was all on the bottom.)   An absolutely ridiculous conversation.   I told her this dish---of many Chinese chicken dishes I've ever had---had the least amount of chicken I'd ever seen.  \"Just bring it back.\"  That stubborn type who just refuses to believe, concede, apologize, no matter what or no matter who's on the other end.

Okay...this is a stretch...but if this woman was alerted that she has a call from the White House itself, and our Commander in Chief...go with me on this...in the same mellow manner---as I tried my best to maintain---he brings the very meager quantity to her attention, and she quickly says, \"MR. PRESIDENT, there was a LOT of chicken in it!  A LOT of chicken!  I packed it MYSELF, Mr. President!\"  Just one of those people who dig in their heels and never back off, no matter how senseless.   

She told me to bring it back for a refund.  I said I wasn't going back out tonight.  Then bring it back tomorrow.  I said that I probably couldn't.   Or the day after, she said, to show the chef (?)---to put it in the refrigerator until then.  Back and forth.   I'm getting a headache just writing this, and rather than giving one to you, let me put us both out of our misery by saying my Take-Out will soon be Take-Back.    

As a footnote, the very tasty Pad Thai had a generous amount of chicken and shrimp. 

I'd rate both dishes as easy 4 stars for flavor, freshness, and ingredients,  despite the missing chicken pieces.  Where DID they go, anyway?  Simply vanished.  

\"The Case of the Missing Chicken\". 

to be continued......

4/3/2012 update.  What had started out as a principle issue, I soon realized was just too trivial to bother with.  For the missing dollars worth of chicken, I just ate it.  And it was still very good sans poultry.   Next time---I'll be smart---and eat in."}
{"text":"King Wah doesn't look like much from the outside, but because of the good reviews my husband and I decided to give it a try. After living in Cleveland for almost a year we were still lacking a solid Chinese place, and I can say this was definitely the best we've had so far! 

We started our meal off with the Wor Bar Soup for two. It had shrimp, chicken, and ham, as well as veggies, then was topped with crackling rice. It came in a nice sized pot which gave us each 3 bowls full of soup. It is served with shrimp chips (or prawn crackers) which are a nice addition. For $7.50 this was well, WELL worth the price, and I would have paid more for it considering it was so huge. You could really make a meal out of the soup, it was so filling. 

Next we had pot stickers. The pot stickers weren't as crispy on the outside as we were used to, but the filling was very good. I'm really picky about the filling inside of these because I feel like it can be questionable sometimes, lol. But the meat inside was very clean tasting, with a hint of ginger, and they weren't overly greasy or anything. We really liked them a lot!

For our entrees we ordered shrimp lo mein and sesame chicken. They each came on a big plate that could definitely serve more than one person. If you're into sharing and tasting different things or having a bit of several dishes, this would be a good place to do so. Think of it as the Buca Di Beppo of Chinese food. We both liked our dishes very much. My husband's sesame chicken had a generous portion of nicely steamed broccoli, and lots of peppers with the dish. My lo mein was very good and very unique. If you are someone who eats lo mein a lot you know it usually has thicker noodles and a thin brown sauce. This lo mein had very thin noodles, and a thick brown sauce, but it was very tasty and had a great garlic and ginger flavor. It was different than any other lo mein that I've had before, but it was really good and I would definitely order it again. It had plenty of shrimp too, so that was a plus. Something else that I was happy with was that the food was well paced coming out. The soup came out first, then dumplings, then the entrees. I hate when you order and every course is on your table in 10 mins. The food was fresh and you can tell they actually took the appropriate amount of time to cook it. It wasn't just sitting around waiting to be heated up. (And as a side note, we felt great after our meal. You know sometimes Chinese food can leave you feeling sick or gross, but the food sat well with us.)

So overall the food was very fresh, with great flavors, and generous portions. We went in on a Sunday afternoon around 4-4:30 and the restaurant was busy, but not packed or overly crowded. It was a great experience. Our bill was $45 before tip for the 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, and we agree it was worth the money. Our waitress was polite and attentive, and we had a great time. We will definitely go back!"}
