{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious and healthy... score!!!  The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back. I've only eaten their salads and wraps and all items from these selections are flavorful. I am never disappointed when I come to Flower Child and I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Flower child is amazing!!! So happy my friend showed me this place and it's minutes from my place. Located in Arcadia (where the old blockbuster used to be) it's central, easy to find, and well worth a commute!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for a healthy hearty meal. A half a wrap filled me up and tasted like heaven. I have been here twice and both times got the wrap with chicken and green tea. The electic\ rustic environment are simple and comforting. The food is amazingly great...my husband(who doesn't usually enjoy what he calls health nut food) loved it and want to go back the second time. I will say the parking is bad. We had to drive around for 10 mins to find a spot in the crowed lot both times. The service on the second visit was also a lot slower even though they weren't even busy. We saw three tables who ordered after us get their food first. I really like this place and will for sure be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"If you want fresh, healthy, light fare this is the perfect place. If you're starving and want to stuff yourself, go somewhere else. It's very vegetarian friendly too. 

The food is really good, and a big bonus for the creativity.  Today, I had their granola salad, which was very tasty and their sweet potatoes side...yum!  They also have kids menu. Both my kids had the mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and a choice of meat.  The desert selection is pretty decadent too. 

The atmosphere is an informal, swanky, hippie. Think the hippie who spends $300 for ripped jeans. 

It is a little pricey...$8 for my salad, $4 for the side. You have to wait in line to order, then it is served to your table on (nice) plastic (correction - bamboo) plates and bowls. But, the freshness and creativity make up for it. 

Service is friendly and they're on top of getting the empties out of our way. Definitely worth a visit when you're in a healthy mood."}
{"text":"My all time favorite vegan restaurant in Phoenix  I highly recommend the Thai cashew quinoa bowl"}
{"text":"Since Flower Child has opened in this location I have been waiting for the opportunity to visit.  I am very familiar with other restaurants in the area but this week chose to take a friend out of for lunch and she was keen to check it out.  The service was great at the counter and we didn't have to wait long.  I was taken aback at the price of a bowl plus salmon but thought it would be worth it.  I was shocked at the tiny amount of food, almost as if it was the end of 'pot' Thw salmon was infinitesimal and, for a moment, I thought it was a joke.  $9 for the bowl and $7 for the salmon was ridiculous.  I have no problem spending on good food and I would rather have gone to St Francis and paid $10 more for their Superfood Salmon dish or to Sauce across the road, $13 for a generous proportion of quinoa, arugula and salmon.  I have never been disappointed with that.  I feel incredibly let down as I had high expectations.  There are so many great eating places along the Camelback Corridor that one doesn't have to be shortchanged for a high dollar."}
{"text":"Was skeptical when I first got to the restaurant but I decided to grab a couple sides and add a protein. I got the corn and quinoa, which was delicious. The sweet potatoes were sweet and perfectly seasoned. I decided to do salmon as the protein and it was delectable! The hummus, my last side, wasn't my favorite. Don't leave without getting the fresh lemonade/tea, it won't disappoint. Overall I gave this four stars because the food was great but for the portion sizes a tad over priced. Cute place for a brunch with some girlfriends or family!"}
{"text":"My go to place for lunch and dinner, great flavors, fun decor & friendly staff.

I love the forbidden rice bowl and usually get the soup of the day.  Never disappointed.  I usually take out because the lines can be long.  

Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the The Mother Earth Bowl with chicken. I thought I was making a healthy choice (small serving size approximately 1 1/2 cups). I looked up the nutritional info. when I got home... whopping 700+ calories.  I was shocked.  I didn't see a nutritional info. posted, but should have asked. This dish definitely was not worth the calories.

I won't go back to Flower Child"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.
If you want healthy food, this is it. Portionsizes are generous, the mint amd cucumber lemonade is to die for and I love the corn quinoa with salmom on top. Lines are long at lunch but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Very good Mac and cheese! I recommend it! Very good healthy food and service!"}
{"text":"This lunch/dinner place is so good. It is conveniently located, right next to the Camelback Village, and there food is delicious. This is a place where you don't have to worry about ordering an unhealthy meal. Everything there is healthy! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a lunch or dinner . Not too expensive at all . Great tea and lemonade . Really great deals on the kids menu. Very clean place. Good service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! If you are looking for delicious healthy food that is fresh, local and organic come check it out. I just moved away from Phoenix and I miss coming here so much, I used to go almost every day."}
{"text":"Great selection of foods for the whole family. My wife and I oftentimes have difficulty finding a place that can accommodate all of our dietary restrictions (she is vegetarian, and our daughter is gluten intolerant). This place is well-priced, healthy, and fun!"}
{"text":"This place is just kind of blah. Way over priced, pretentious, and mediocre food. I'm still regretting not just going next door to Jimmy Johns  (about the same quality of food)."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but the music/noise is unbearable, cant have a conversation."}
{"text":"Stopped in for our first time to grab some healthy beverages. Kombucha on tap was awesome. Daily juice was a total rip-off. $6 took 10 minutes and was all ice. Two sips and done. All trend and no substance. Just go to Whole Foods."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Come here on a weekly basis. The food is wonderful and fresh. 
Excellent customer service. 
One of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been to. 
A guaranteed smile!"}
{"text":"UPDATED Review: they sell \"loyalty cups\" but when you try to get discounted/free refills with it, they then describe it as a souvenir cup and tell you that you still have to pay for the drinks on top of the cup price which is $15! They only tell you this after you buy the cups. I paid $30 for 2 cups and still have to pay for refills ..... Satisfying food but very unsatisfactory service. I've been ordering 2-5 meals 1-3 times a week for about a year now. Also their food is starting to be \"hit or miss\" in terms of quality and taste. Very disappointed because I used to love this place :(
Old review: I eat here at least once a week- delicious and healthy, and for a reasonable price. Love their sweet potatoes. One of the few places I can get delicious paleo meals for a decent price!"}
{"text":"Good very organic type of restaurant. More of a lunch atmosphere, but dinner was great there too"}
{"text":"house lemonades are incredible! Loved all the side options and ended up ordering a sampling of each of them, which was a great choice for our group as every single one impressed. My favorite was the mac and cheese, the sweet potatoes and the roasted cauliflower. Will definitely make this place a regular stop for our family of 7. Kids meals are the best!"}
{"text":"We had to come see what all the hype was about! Loved the ambiance & decor, shabby chic/vintage, hippy... Super cute! 

Only docking one star since they don't have a breakfast menu :( & that's what we were there for! 

Ordered salmon & salad - 2 thumbs up! & late riser -DELICIOUS!  Great selection of iced teas, this alone buys me I love different teas. 

Found a new go to place you can't beat healthy & fresh !"}
{"text":"I wish my stay in Phoenix were longer so I could eat here again. I am vegan and live in Florida, and was so impressed with the variety of menu items at Flower Child. I ordered the mother earth bowl, and it was delicious! I had never heard of broccoli pesto, but it added a unique and enjoyable flavor to the dish. The atmosphere was also pleasant; it was a bit loud inside, but the patio was well kept and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food here! Would definitely recommend if you're looking for quality food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a healthy, yummy meal!! I wish there were more locations everywhere."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great atmosphere and very cute and earthy. Sad to hear that the vegan pho is a seasonal item as it is the only place that i can get my hands on a delicious pho with vegan broth. The mashed potatoes are the absolute best. Seriously, ive never had better mashed potatoes anywhere else. The cauliflower is delicious and well seasoned too!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service...MEH food. Flower Power is in a perfect location to thrive, right at Camelback and Central in the middle of the action. the crowd here is biz professional and really good-looking soccer moms.

i've been here a few times and am impressed with the crowd management. this place, tho new, gets BIZ-ZAY, esp around lunch. the staff behind the counter, the food runners and managers are on-hand and do a really enviable job of running a busy location smoothly.

where Flower Power needs improvement is the food.
------a side of summer squash was only 25% squash
------a side of mac & cheese was cold and tiny, not warm and at least a healthy portion
------the flying avocado is OVER-seasoned with salt & pepper and Italian dressing
------the Thai wrap is OVER-sauced with the yum yet over-sugared dressing

the iced tea selection is respectable.

this may just be a Fox RC thing, or maybe just a young line cooks thing...but when you sell yourself as a \"healthy\" restaurant, and you sugar, salt and sauce your food to death, you are not healthy. you just have healthy marketing messaging.

Flower Power is a nice lunch option with a good location and pleasant service, but when i spend $15 or more/per person on lunch, i want to walk away feeling good about the quality of food i consumed...not guilty about how many calories i just ate because of the heavy hand of the line cooks. a little more modestly in your cooking would do you well, young cooks.

i think the health-conscious among us would be very happy with a healthier menu relying on fresh ingredients unhindered by salt/pepper slam dunks and sauce bazookas.

a good start Flower Power, but a ways to go..."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're a Vegan!!!  Nice variety, love all the lemonades.  Love the outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"Flower Child is the best new restaurant in town!! My wife and I go often for delicious, healthy, and hearty meals.  She is a vegetarian and basically the whole menu can be customized to be vegetarian, but has chicken and steak options as well. The whole restaurant is adorable, and looks strait out of a hip, rustic, farm house, or a 'shabby chic' pinterest page. The patio is huge, covered, has misters, and is dog friendly... what more could you ask for!? We take our dogs often and they have readily available water bowls for our little furry friends. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Yippee! I was so looking forward to trying Flower Child especially after seeing their menu online. As I mentioned in previous reviews I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I feel like Sam Fox is like Midas and again he has turned a dining establishment into gold. 

My friend and I ate lunch there today. Flower Child is a fast casual concept where you place your order and then they bring you your food.

I ordered the Asian Avocado salad and a side of sweet corn w/ quinoa. Everything was absolutely delicious. I pretty much devoured the whole meal. I let my friend do most of the talking while we were eating because I was enjoying the food so much! My brain was in total food reward mode. 

Oh...did I mention that they have gluten free baked goods? I had a gluten free bittersweet brownie and I'm pretty sure it revolutionized my entire life. I'm pretty sure if the brownie were a man, we would be walking down the aisle."}
{"text":"Fox Restaurants does it again.   The mix plate is my order every time because then I can taste different things, and nothing ever disappoints.  The corn dish was the best and I keep getting it with two other new things.  Clean, fast, orderly -- music loud but I sit outside at the Scottsdale location.  Delightful menu, good ambiance."}
{"text":"Very sick after eating at this restaurant. I was up all night and sick with classic food poisoning symptoms for 2 days after eating the \"Mother Earth\" at this Flower Child. What's also concerning is that after sharing how ill I was with friends and family members, many of them also reported becoming ill with the same gastrointestinal symptoms after eating at Flower Child restaurants. Either the meat is undercooked or the vegetables or food preparers hands are not washed properly. Better have another health inspection on your locations and step up your sanitary regulations or you'll be shut down."}
{"text":"I love the amount of choices available - and the free ice tea refills!"}
{"text":"Flower child that used to be a go to location for me. However my last exposure there, ordering everything from the gluten-free restaurant, it's no longer safe. Something was cross contaminated as a painfully found out later."}
{"text":"D-E-L-I-S-H !!! I follow a Soy free, Gluten free, Dairy free diet and they accommodated my special requests.  Food that supports wellness!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I tried a couple dishes and both were very good. The service was good and everyone was very friendly. It was a little pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED - UNDERWHELMED :(

We really wanted to like this place...the concept is good and the location and interior attractive but the food - the #1 reason for going...was sadly disappointing.

Our first visit I swung by to get take out.  My dish, a stir fry type bowl with quinoa was basically a bland glob of thick sauced quinoa over veggies - it looked like it had been prepared by an inexperienced 16yr old.  My BF on the other hand, enjoyed his bowl topped with grass-fed beef, though the portion wasn't particularly generous.  Because he enjoyed his dish I was happy to go back and give it a second go.

Visit #2
Thoroughly disappointing :((
My BF dropped 50+ bones for 1 app, 2 entrees and 2 NON-alcoholic drinks AND we left HUNGRY!!!  Our salad app was overly chopped, with paper thin slices of cauliflower that laid low in the bowl ...it was probably $ .80 worth of vegetables for $8 with bland, oily dressing.  Same issue with the entrees - the flavors we're alright though nothing to write home about but the portions were SO small especially for what you pay - the value does NOT match the price, they're consistently skimpy with their portions.  The absolute worst is after three dishes and two drinks for over $50 we walked away HUNGRY!!!  We stopped on the way home to get something else to eat.

I really feel it deserved 1.5 stars, that earned for the bright clean surroundings and generally friendly staff but when the food experience is not good, the atmosphere is little consolation.

We really wanted to like it but overall underwhelming and disappointing.  Do better FOX!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so after playing tennis for an hour...I was sore, tired, and sweaty...decided to try this place that is so close to me....for the first time...Given what I had just done exercise wise ..I wasn't about to eat in ...so I got the vegan Caesar salad with salmon to go.....15 dollars later I got home with it. When I looked at was in the bag I thought....\"I just paid 15 bucks for that\"!   but then I tasted it...the salmon didn't look like much but had a really good flavor and I ate it quickly...then I started with the salad...I didn't even need to add the dressing...it had such a great taste that I waited till only a third of it was left.   And that's only because I wanted to know what a vegan Caesar dressing tastes like...I will go back I'm sure over and over...so happy an organic place like this is so close to me..Next time...I will eat in ...I'm excited to try other menu items there."}
{"text":"I mean, the food was ok, but very overpriced.  $5 to add 5 little slices of chicken. $30 for a takeout salad and chicken plate is ridiculous, considering the portions are tiny.  Also, sat waiting 25 minutes for our food. Finally went up to ask where it was and the girl said, oh we did call your name awhile ago. Ok... maybe try again?  On the plus side, it's super cute."}
{"text":"The staff is always amazing and helpful. The food is always 100%. As someone with gluten and dairy allergies, they are always extremely careful not to cross contaminate and offer substitutions for my meals. Even when the lines are long, they always try their hardest and make it worth your while. Everything on the menu is amazing, and my new favorite I their dark chocolate (vegan) pudding! Seriously, to die for. Love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how much I love this place. Let's just say the first time I tried it, I went back again the next day! Can't get enough of their Thai Dye. I'm also an avid juicer and have tried so many different juice bars in Scottsdale and their juice holds its own! Plus, it's only around $6 instead of the $8-10+ at other juice bars. Everyone is always super nice and helpful even when the line is going out of the door! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Healthy food doesn't have to be boring. Flower Child gets it. Great food, better atmosphere. Love the brussels, cauliflower, cashew bowl & yummy refreshing choices in juices & teas."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Healthy and tastes good. Decor is solid. Like it after a workout. If the prices were lower, I'd eat here 2-3 times per week."}
{"text":"This really is an awesome place. 

Major Pros: 
1. Delicious foods
2. No glares for what you order (No vegetarian elittist attitude whatsoever...not even a hint!)
3. Fantastic Customer Service (Got a greeting right away and an offer to help with any questions. In the dining room. Helpful, friendly, aware staff were constantly running around, busing tables, offering extra help, and readily available.)
4. Almost everything is customer friendly. You don't even have to ask for to-go containers, and the center-pieces on the tables have all the silverware and stuff you'll need (and there's more near the drink station). 
5. Extremely cute inside. 

Small cons: 
1. Typically busy (Long line during peak hours and a healthy amount of noise)
2, You pay a lot for the little amount of food you get (but that's expected on this side of town and it is high-quality food). 
3. the flow of the place is confusing. (So many options for entrances and exits and bathrooms and only one place to order. You walk in on one side and then realize the other side is where the line is and it's out the door)."}
{"text":"Is it ridiculously overpriced? Yes. Is it tasty? Yes. Is it trendy in that gluten free, kale hard-on, coconut water kind of way? Oh yes. I used to get the veggie wrap, which was recently taken off the menu. Now I order the Mother Earth with chicken. It's a mostly healthy symphony of flavor and textures. The avocado hummus, sweet potatoes, and curry cauliflower are standouts. It pains me to spend $25 on a meal for one person, especially considering the portions are conservative and it's casual dining. Do I go here anyway? Yes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! I have eaten so much there. Love the lemonades and teas too. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. It's great to be able to go with our baby too! Very clean - and great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Such a great ambiance and atmosphere! Love all of the menu and tea / lemonade options. We have had the quinoa salad, tomato soup, beef wrap, avocado hummus, and a few other items, and they all are amazing! The prices and service are great as well. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Flower child quality is outstanding but there is a real problem with portion size and consistency.  Over the last year I have probably eaten here 30+ times and over the last 6 months this has gotten worse.  I've mentioned it specifically on  to go orders asking that they check the portions and I'm replied to with a nod and a smile yet I never see the person who takes the order and the one who packs it speak.  For the price paid you definitely are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to value for tee dollar.  Quality good but a sliver of salmon sweet potatoes and avocado +kombucha for 21 bucks is kind of a rip.  Sam Fox feel free to message me and I'll happily give you my number."}
{"text":"I've been here before the food was great and so was the service. This time i picked up to go to my surprise when i got home. I received burnt brussels sprouts. Very disappointed,i don't think i'll be returning again."}
{"text":"YOU WILL LEAVE HUNGRY!! 
I hate that I am the person writing a bad review but enough is enough! There portions are incredible small and the prices are that of a normal size portion. I am a small girl & can not eat that much at once so I can not figure out what is going on???
I have ordered salads, wraps, and the warm dishes. All incredibly small portions.
I called in and ordered the Hippie Chic wrap. I asked for extra chicken salad because if I do not I get maybe 4 bites with filling and the rest is wrap. When I arrived they charged me $17.17 for a wrap!! The normal price is $11 and I told the girl the only way I get what I pay for is to ask for extra. I had to get to work & could not wait to speak to the manager. I have done so previously and will just no longer go there.
There are many many other restaurants that have fresh food & realistic portions.
Just know you will leave hungry."}
{"text":"This place made me want to vomit. This is by far the worst restaurant in Phoenix Arizona. There food tastes like vomit. I tried some of their nasty carrot juice and spit it back into the flowers they put on the table. This place is for old smelly people who have lost there tastebuds and don't even know what they are eating. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend UNLESS MY FRIEND WAS 100 YEARS OLD. Although if my 100 year grandma are here she would probably die because the food is so disgusting. This place is disgusting please shut down this restaurant NOW. Watch out Flower Child this girl is very upset."}
{"text":"This was my first time and it will not be my last.  The atmosphere is wonderful and relaxing and the food is so healthy and just right.  I especially love the variety of lemonade they have to offer...refreshing.   I had the Mediterranean salad and added the chicken and it was good and fresh and just delicious.   They have great customer service and are super friendly.  I highly recommend visiting Flower Child.  Also, try the cute chocolate cake.  Yummo!"}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! Amazing service and the food is phenomenal! Left feeling full, healthy and refreshed."}
{"text":"Love this place for take out! They are so organized and the take out experience is a pleasant breeze. The food is so satisfying I have tried everything vegetarian on the menu and I LOVE it all. They have kombucha on tap which is the bomb. I hoard the vegan cheesecake it is soooo good! Great staff, super friendly and it's always nice and clean."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and have always been pleased with our experience.  The kale salad with salmon is very good as is the flying avocado wrap.  Im not too impressed with the Spicy Salmon Nabemono...it falls a bit short in the flavor department.  Their teas and lemonade are tasty, but be careful with the lemonade as it can be a bit sugary.  The sweet corn and quinoa side is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. The food and drinks were AMAZING and our server Emily was extremely helpful and kind. The portion sizes are perfect and the environment was great too. Overall a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say, the place is absolutely wonderful! My girlfriend and I went to Flower Child Wednesday the 13th of May. After waiting in line for over twenty minutes  this place shocked me! The food was absolutely excellent, I had a dish the \"Mother Earth\" which was very delicious but the ancient grains were very hard on my teeth. The manager, Amy went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy with my meal, she took the dish back and allowed me to choose another dish. I picked the \"Late Riser\" what a wonderful choice it was! Thank you so much for everything and treating my girlfriend and I wonderfully!"}
{"text":"I don't like it that much, but I know people that do, personally don't come here unless you like eating healthy. 
       If you do, kudos my friend you'll love it here."}
{"text":"Love it...line moves quickly and U truly can't  put a time on the wait cause it is so worth it...Organic Baby....lol very Happy Dear here.... Blessed...  just got back from Singh Farm...!!!  Very nice following...  the Farm to the F C.....xo"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. It is perfect for a group with differing tastes. There is something to make everyone happy. Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free choices with organic produce are served, as well as a selection of meat dishes. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. 
My favorite dishes so far are the gluten free Mac-and-cheese, Thai cashew quinoa, and the Hippie chick wrap. Their olive oil cake is scrumptious- not too sweet, and I love their lemonade. The tea here is great as well. Do yourself (and your health) a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Food was good. Too loud like a diner in NYC
Interesting concept staff appear all under 30 very courteous and fast moving. Impressive! Will be nice when it cools down to sit on patio. Furniture is awesome. Peace Out"}
{"text":"It's too bad you can't eat the whole menu in one sitting, the whole thing sounds so appetizing.  Cheap if you go vegetarian, expensive to add meat.  I got the veggie chop salad and it was very good."}
{"text":"I am happy to have a healthier food option in the neighborhood.  I enjoy the dishes I've had so far,  especially the Salmon Namemono(?) :-) Light, Asian, and it goes down easy if I eat late after work.  All in all everything I've had so far has been very good. Avoid prime time if you want to find parking and avoid a hectic atmosphere though! I think they've done a lot to help the job market out! Tons of employees!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Definitely pricey for a turkey wrap with some lettuce and avocado served with some greens on the side. Drinks cost $3+. It is basically one large dining room so it is very loud. We had to speak in raised voices to have lunchtime conversation. Not sure I would return and pay $16 for lunch again."}
{"text":"Visited for first time on a Saturday at around noon.  Extremely pleasant service at counter.  Menu was perfect.  Lots of flavor and options to add proteins to salads etc.  The ginger lemonade is very strong ...but a perfect accompaniment to the ginger dressed salads so don't be afraid to try it.  Food came out quickly and was extremely fresh and beautifully prepared/played.  Large portions.

Very casual comfortable vibe.  Eclectic fun interiors. Lots of locals.  All ages.  My teenage daughter commented that all of the male kitchen staff had their hair pulled up in \"man buns\"!  Fun stuff. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love the menu, the food and friendly service. However, the music was a few decibels to high for conversation. So for us.... jury is still out on whether we go back."}
{"text":"I. AM. OBSESSED. 
I love everything about this place! Décor, vibe and of course, food are AWESOME. I've gotten stuck on the quinoa salad and have been craving it daily. HUGE BONUS is the kids menu. I took my munchkin with me and he could get fresh, un-fried food too! Mac & cheese, smashed potatoes, broc & roasted vegetables are some of his new favorites.  Love it! Uhhh...can I get a punch card?? :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  The food is healthy and delicious and fairly priced.  Nice décor and atmosphere.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The employee who helped me out was informative about the menu. It was my first time and I had no idea what to order being a Libra! I told him I am on a vegetarian diet currently so he was able to narrow down what my options were. I enjoyed an amazing quinoa meal and I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each meal has been impressively good. The food is healthy, well-prepared and the service is quick enough considering the usual high volume of customers. This place is great for vegans, but I would suggest the vegan ingredient salad + chicken for anyone who isn't afraid to consume a little fowl."}
{"text":"Seriously Sooo good. My wife and I are eating healthier... Something about that magical decade (other wise known as your 40's) that you want to eat healthier and get back in shape. If you know that feeling.. Start here. The menu is simple yet delicious and love that they offer raw foods. I had the summer vegan which was delicious and spinach which was served amazingly perfect.The portion is good, so even though your eating greens, you still get full!! The vegetables are super yummy and fresh. Priced reasonably and the atmosphere is comforting. Stop in to fill your tummy and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Must try the flying avocado wrap! It's sooo yummy. This place is full of great healthy food. I have yet to eat something bad here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here for dinner. Healthy and delicious food! So many options for vegans etc."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food. Healthy Kid-Friendly options. A variety of fresh brewed ice tea. Large open patio seating. Trendy decor. 

Could be better: Their assigned seating system seems to be cumbersome even for the staff. Unless you have been here before you could end up in the takeout-only line and not even know it because the line is usually out the door. Their assigned seating process goes something like this... If a number is not given to you, you cannot stand in line to order. Once you are given a number you may place your food order. So just be prepared to stand and wait in a lot of different lines. In my opinion, because of the popularity of this resturaunt, I think they could better serve their customers by offering a traditional wait service with a separate to-go area."}
{"text":"Great fresh and healthy food! Went after a morning at the spa as a girls day out and I can't wait to go back to try more stuff! Organic and gluten free options. The food was great! Had the Late Riser that was super satisfying after not eating breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Flower Child is out of this world chic county cool...almost like the gal from HGTV \"fixer upper\" just scooted out the back door! But honestly...the food is OK...better than average... a bit expensive for the portion size...and the warehouse  high ceilings made it blasting loud! (My gal friend and I were shouting at one another, until the crowd settled down after 2:30pm) BUT the service was SUPER friendly and helpful. I WOULD GO BACK, but would not want to be starving with my $10 bill in hand! The bathrooms were very clean ...and cute...AND QUIET!! Haha! ...enjoy your loud, cute fun and expensive experience at busy crowded FLOWER CHILD!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and tried several of the bowl dishes. I have to say they are quite delicious. Ingredients are very fresh, veggies still a little crisp, and some very inspired flavor combinations. Also love the lemonade and tea and the fact that you can get refills for free. Reminds me of true food kitchen. 

That all being said I have two criticisms:

1. Price - this is essentially a modified fast food restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. Yet a bowel costs $9 and that doesn't include any meat. I ordered tofu which is the cheapest protein at $4. And btw I got 5 cuts equaling roughly a quarter of a full block of tofu. At the grocery store a block would cost me roughly $2. Also ordered a lemonade so my meal ended up fairly close to $20. That's a little steep for a casual dining place. And the portions are reasonably sized which means you can eat the whole meal in one sitting so no left overs to make you feel like your getting more for your money. 

2. When full - which is both times I've been (sun and Tuesday afternoons) - it's pretty loud in the restaurant. Although most of these modern restaurants are just one big room with hard floors so usually are quite loud. 

I want to love this place and keep coming but the prices are a little too steep for what you get."}
{"text":"I could eat their gluten free mac and cheese all day! Delicious. Tons of options for customers who are gluten free. Staff was nice and friendly, and the dining space was very open and spacious! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love that this Flower Child has more patio seating than the Phoenix location.  We had good service and I always love the food.  Delicious and unique.  My only complaint is that they don't have anything to entertain kids like crayons, paper, etc."}
{"text":"Wow! Everything about this place is awesome. We were greeted by friendly smiling staff, had lots of awesome menu choices, the food was delivered to our table in a timely manner and then we tasted it! Happy happy tastebuds! Fresh, clean and delicious. I had the Mother Earth bowl and my husband had forbidden Rice Bowl with the chopped salad. We traveled from the Denver Metro area, will you open up one of these fabulous eateries near us?"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place, and the manager has done such a great job of turning what is typically a transactional type restaurant, into a personable one. The manager went out of his way to not only get to know us, but the entire time he was constantly encouraging his staff. True display of what makes a successful restaurant. It also helps that the food is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer at Flower Child since they opened and continue to go often for dinner.  It has gone from consistently great to fairly inconsistent on a regular basis.  I picked up dinner tonight instead of staying to eat.  I ordered the sweet corn quinoa, which is typical for me to order.  When I opened the container I could tell that it had a rotten sour smell to it.  I called the restaurant to let them know that I had to toss it and that they should probably let someone know.  Not sure it mattered - I was made to feel like it was stupid of me to call.  

This restaurant is pricey, which I will pay for if the food is great food.  I also would expect that management would want the staff to make a customer that picked up $50 of food worth listening to.  

They need to get back to the beginning when the staff was more attentive and serious and the food was consistent."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place !  I can be found dining often on their delicious dishes with lean protein options.  If you're Vegan - Vegetarian or just plain want HEALTHY choices - this place is it!"}
{"text":"Our default choice for lunch or a quick dinner. If we're in a vegitarian mood, or something with protein Flower Child doesn't disappoint. 

Today we had the chopped vegitarian salad with wild salmon & Thai cashew quinoa bowl with shaved chicken. We've eaten our way around the menu with pleasure. Overall I would highly recommend if you're  looking for healthy options."}
{"text":"Similar to True Foods but more convenient, order at the counter concept. Love it! Have only been here once but looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"great location, healthy menu, friendly staff, quick turnaround on order, bright open and airy restaurant.  really liked the industrial, sparse look and ambiance.  i was not happy with what i ordered, but want to stress that was 100% on me, not FC. will be back again, and will be a little more daring next time."}
{"text":"First time diner.  Had 'Strawberry Fields' - DELICIOUS!  Super fresh creative combination of greens, goat cheese, mulberries (who knew!) coconut shavings and strawberries that made my mouth and tummy very happy.  My friend had the chopped vegetable with chicken - she inhaled it!  We shared some spinach and cauliflower (sooooooooo goooood) sides.  And I cannot say enough about the pita - crazy thin yet enormously flavorful handmade delights.   Staff are welcoming and friendly.  Cool decor.  Gotta' go back soon!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing so much about Flower Child in the last few months and was dying to check it out. Being just a couple blocks down from my green beauty headquarters at the Biltmore what a convenient place this would be to grab a healthy lunch or dinner on an occasional basis. When I walked in the decor was super very fun and welcoming. The menu I thought was a bit confusing at first but figured it out. I realize that you could really customize it which I like. I love this place and now stop and pick up a lunch or dinner to go. Knowing that they use all local and fresh ingredients is super important to me as well."}
{"text":"I used to go twice a week but I will no longer be going. I was sold a loyalty cup and was told that I can get free drinks with it, today a manager stopped and said I still have to pay for the drink. He didn't care what I was told before. Flowerchild miss represented itself and obviously the management is not on the same page with its employees."}
{"text":"Whoa! This was my first visit while I was in Phoenix last night and I will definitely go back. The food is delicious, the beverages are on point, great friendly service, excellent atmosphere. I can't say enough good things.

I travel a lot and eating vegan and healthy can be a challenge. This place is one of my favorites.

I had the Mother Earth and it was a favorite. The serving size was a little bit small, but on par with the price. The staff was super nice and patient while I was deciding.
I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yep, this is a perfect lunch dinner spot. Bright, friendly, healthy, neighborhood and family friendly, and the food was very flavorful. The menu was a little confusing at first but I always just ask what the most popular dishes are and go from there. I wish it was a little less expensive as I would go there a few days a week for luch, but I cannot justify spending over $9 or $10 on lunch, so it's a once in a while kind of lunch eatery."}
{"text":"What a great new spot in Scottsdale. This area really needed something healthy, fun, and different and that's exactly what Flower Child is. The hummus is to die for. The only reason I only gave Flower Child 4 stars is because it is pretty pricey. The meals aren't huge but you will pay a minimum of $18 for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My husband I went there a few weeks ago because the menu reminded us so much of a little gem we found in NYC a few weeks prior - we were craving some more!  So we thought this would be a great local find.  Maybe it's because we had such high hopes based on this other restaurant, but Flower Child misses the vision.  We likely won't return since the prices were just too high, the quantities too small, and the service was so-so (only brought us food, never followed up or checked on us). If we hadn't studied the menu before going in, it would have been confusing to order. 
We were still hungry after spending $30-40 for the two of us (no drinks included), so we went over to AJ's next door to pick up some healthy snacks. We aren't big people, just healthy and fit, so we have a healthy appetite. Wish the healthy menu was healthier on our wallets and was more satisfying. 
Gave it two stars because at least it's trying."}
{"text":"Decent food and nice atmosphere. Slightly pricy for what you get but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"I love the food and I recommend it to everyone.
The potatoes were awesome. The dip is good . It's all fresh. EAT THERE"}
{"text":"I ate here 2x this week. The summer vegan salad with grassfed steak (Yes! I know that sounds so cliche) is something I cannot. stop. eating. I crave this salad. I don't know what kind of magic dust they put in their dressing, but being able to eat a healthy salad with grassfed meat topped with a dressing that actually doesn't have any sugar in it-is a feeling I cannot explain. The service is always great, too. Its a fast causal concept so regardless wether you need to run in and grab something quick or join a co-worker for a lunch break this places gets it!"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy place to eat.  Had a fresh made apple carrot ginger lemon juice.  Cold with all flavors balanced. An app of heirloom tomato watermelon mint basil and pepper.  Magnificently refreshing with just enough sweetness to save some for after the entree. And the bowl. Greens. Ancient grains. Sweet potato. Portobello mushroom and onion grilled. Cucumber. Sea salted avocado. Broccoli pesto. Hemp seeds. And another ingredient -sorry forgot. Beautiful marriage of flavors. 
Way to go Flower Child!  Love to y'all!
Reasonable pricing as well!
And great music playing and beautiful light interior.  
&&& the service was great~!
Feel good after you eat :)"}
{"text":"Arcadia as usual. Great food and super fast service. We walked in, ordered, and literally within 2 minutes of sitting down.. had our fresh food delivered. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hands down, my new favorite Cafe. The food is amazing. I highly recommend the Indian spiced cauliflower and the Thai eggplant. You will have a foodgasm on the first bite!"}
{"text":"I can't get over how amazing this lunch was with my hunk! I wish I had known about the Flower Child years ago!!! The food was so fresh and bursting with flavor! Their menu is full of vegan options AND meat eating goodies... Neither of us had to compromise! If your local- give this cute eatery a try (and take advantage of the patio)!"}
{"text":"Flower Child has counter service and serves salads, sides, wraps, and Pho. The food is good but prices are comparable to full table service in most restaurants in the area. Example: salads are approx. $7 or $8 without proteins which are an additional $4-$7; wraps $9-$13; sides $4-$7 ea. Again, this is counter service....dinner for two $40-50 depending on your protein. We are vegetarian so our meals tend to run around $20 pp.  They offer a good selection of sides especially for vegetarian, vegan and gluten free diners. Like True Food Kitchen \"lite\". 

Issues: Some foods tend to arrive luke warm or even cold, or at least they have on four different visits which suggests that most food is pre-made and sitting on warming tables. We asked if the food was supposed to be cold and were told they were usually served hot.  All in all service has been friendly. Our party sent one entree back and a manager delivered the replacement within a couple of minutes with a scowl, practically dropping it on the table in front of us, and turning immediately away. She never returned to see if it was better. We felt unwelcome. Staff sits at tables eating and joking around in front of customers. Great potential but some issues that don't seem up to Fox Restaurant Concepts level of quality & service."}
{"text":"I really love the food here, but today was the second time I received the wrong to go order."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side, but excellent. They have lots of gluten free and vegetarian options. Great for those who are trying to lose weight or make healthy choices. Their vegetarian ingredient salad is amazing as well as their eggplant dish. The cauliflower is the only dish I have disliked so far because it has too much curry on it and is too oily."}
{"text":"First time here and got the mother earth bowl and chicken and...yum did it have good flavors!  Only issues I had was I left still hungry after $15 worth of lunch.  I'm a petite person that can eat so a bit disappointed on the amount.  Other than that probably will be back if I'm ever on this side of town."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and had the vegan hash and avocado toast. Also had the daily juice. Everything was fresh and delicious.  Very clean restaurant.  Will definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"This place is everything I hoped it to be. The daily vegetable soups, gluten free chocolate chip cookies and brownies, and veggie wraps are so delicious. My favorite menu item has to be the chili glazed sweet potatoes, though. Seriously, get them! I could eat 3 orders for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great, fast and healthy food. We ordered the Forbidden 9 rice and the Thai Cashew Quinoa dish both with chicken. Don't forget the lemon cupcake!!!! Has a great atmosphere to the place."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get.
We  both ordered different types of salads. Plus a avocado dip. One cold tea beverage. The check was just over $28.00   dollars!!!!! The salads were 90% lettuce and 10% of the other items described on the menu.
As well as the cashier told the hostess we were \"impatient \" because we wanted a table but ordered to go and wanted a table if it became available.  Somewhat of a jerk of a cashier."}
{"text":"Today the restaurant was so crowded I decided to take out. I ordered mashed potatoes, chicken and brussels sprouts. What I got was an absolutely TINY amount of mac n cheese, not small = TINY. Not what I ordered and very disappointing.

Honestly, for 16.00, I am completely over this place."}
{"text":"I chose this spot for my birthday lunch with girlfriends. We were met at the door by an adorable young woman who very enthusiastically explained how to order and what her recommendations were. We pretty much followed her choices and picked the avocado hummus, quinoa and sweet corn, a veggie wrap, and the apple-kale slaw! We sat in a corner banquet, and the noise level was fairly reasonable. I would recommend they offer some little bolsters or cute throw pillows as the banquet is NOT very comfortable! The food came very quickly, even though it was pretty busy. I must say, we loved everything! I am anxious to try to recreate several at home! And the four items were just right for the three of us...with a shared lemon birthday bundt cake for dessert! I think three staff came to the table to check to see if we were happy with our food. Clear away was timely and we felt comfortable staying awhile to open gifts and chat as the crowd was clearing out. Restroom was nicely decorated and tidy, and had a clever \"toe opener\" for a clean hand exit! 
I will definitely return with other health conscience friends I know will appreciate the vegetarian and gluten free options! Might be a bit pricey for serving sizes, but I'm willing to pay for food that well constructed!
Good job, Fox!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here several times and always get the protein plates. I've tried the steak and chicken (I liked the steak better yum) and have had their asparagus, glazed sweet potatoes, heirloom tomatoes, brussel sprouts, and brown rice. Their brussel sprouts are tasty.  The menu is seasonal so some items switch out (the heirloom tomatoes are no longer available). Their iced teas and lemonades are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot, been here a few times the food and service is always super consistent and not to mention AMAZING. I'm not even vegetarian and I love coming here, one of my fav spots!"}
{"text":"Def a case of style over substance. Tofu is flavorless and everything else over spiced. Super small portions for the price. Kids' Mac and cheese served cold. Bleh."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place and I just tried it today for lunch and it was AMAZING. Gorgeous decor definitely caught my eye first and the entire place is airy with plenty of natural light. Everyone working was very polite and helpful. The gal at the register recommended the sweet potatoes and I'm glad I tried them (I usually despise sweet potatoes but these are exceptional). The veggies were fresh and well seasoned, and the gluten free Mac n Cheese was creamy and delicious. My niece tried one of the salads and it definitely filled her up! I really look forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh clean food with a beautiful ambiance.  The Eggplant and Spinach were so tasty.  The Ladies Room is sweet and had a Toepener.  The first time I could open the restroom door with my foot instead of using my clean hands or a towel."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to joining a colleague here and I was so disappointed.  The service was great but the grass fed steak was aged too much- and both my friend and I returned it!  Salads were over dressed, salmon too salty and lemonade had too much sugar.   Also very loud room- not a good place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"If Urban Outfitters were a restaurant, this would be it.  Food was healthy, tasty, and fair price.  I loved the kombucha on tap. It was a little too hipster for my boyfriend, but the food won him over."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Flower Child. My step mom recommended it, so we met up as a group of 5 while my husband and I were visiting the area and staying nearby. I liked the casual environment.

I had the thai cashew quinoa bowl and though it was alright. Had a good seasonal lemonade too.

I love the concept and I'm glad there's a Flower Child closer to my new apartment."}
{"text":"Ordered the strawberry salad with chicken.  This place is busy, and there is no assigned seating.  I wasn't about to sit outside on the patio and sweat in the Arizona heat.  So, I waited inside standing for 15 mins.  Got my salad.  The presentation didn't impress me.  The chicken was dry and I could taste a hint of curry, I wonder how clean their kitchen is. The leaves in my salad were soggy.  I'm guessing my salad was sitting for a bit before they took it out.  For the price, there are much better choices in north Scottsdale.  The first waiter I met was nice, but the guy that served me looked/talked at me like I didn't belong.  Overall, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First time and absolutely loved it! Took the kids 2&8 and they got the kids meals with steak and tofu. Kids ate it all. Avocado hummus with pita very tasty. Got the Late Riser bowl which may be one of the best things I have eaten in a while! Salmon with cauliflower and eggplant. Eggplant was not good. Kombucha on tap and Four Peaks. Overall very happy. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"4 Stars for the smiling faces behind the counter- the girls are always friendly and seem happy to help. Given this place has been open a while now it's a good sign to see happy staff remain!
Happy to see somewhere in town that has several vegan options on their menu, and Kombucha on tap!
The food is good, albeit pricey: thought it was a mistake when I ordered a Forbidden Rice bowl (with tofu) and it came to 14 and some change. I will say, a previous reviewer mentioned the \"value\" and I must agree. I suppose you must factor in the solid decor, and there is a large amount of staff that is always working.
I almost don't mind when the meal is good (I'd loosely compare the flavors of my dish to something you could get at Pei Wei, only with a better variety of, and higher quality ingredients). 
Just expect if you order an entree with protein and a beverage to be spending around $20 with tip. The portions are not huge, and doesn't include the addition of their sides (tried both the tabbouleh and heirloom tomato and watermelon salad, both decent.)
No one in this area will, or does, balk at the price unless maybe they're not from North Scottsdale.
Flower Child has enough going for it that I'd happily return."}
{"text":"I try something new every time I go (at least once a week) and I've never been disappointed. Fantastic vegan, vegetarian, gluten free friendly restaurant. The tap kombucha is a must have. 

Just take my money Flower Child. You've earned it."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat and order to go! The food tastes great! I love their gluten free mac and cheese; you'd never know it was GF if it didn't say so on the menu it is that good! They have a great selection of drinks to choose from to go with your meal and the prices aren't too bad considering how much food you get."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout. The description of the same shunned good, something with strawberries, but it didn't look the way I expected. Not at that price. It tastes pretty good and I enjoyed the dressing. I've been to a different location and will definitely continue to eat at Flower Child. I love the concept."}
{"text":"I got the chopped Vegetable Salad and added chicken. Very deceiving as there were virtually no chopped vegetables to be found in the salad. I paid for a bowl of greens. I found one tomato and a carrot slice, a few edamame and a piece or two of cucumber. The food tasted good but come on, where are the vegetables?. I feel it's overpriced for what you get and they are doing so well on the hype. Also, I don't understand how a place like this has zero nutritional information available for any of their food?"}
{"text":"All Sam Fox restaurants seem to have the same things in common: great atmosphere and interior design, ok food. I wish the food was as good, heck better, than the design work. I've had ok food and good food at Sam Fox restaurants but I've never had great food. A lot of people seem to say that. I do however admire his success and his variety of restaurants so cheers to that. I also want to give this place another try. So let's get to it....

As usual the place looks cool, good vibe, friendly staff. Very friendly , A+ there. I was choosing between the Avocado Asian Salad with chicken or the Sesame Beef Bowl. The lovely girl helping me suggested the beef bowl win this war and rang me up. $16 for a beef bowl? Really?! Good lord. The salad would have cost me $14. And I thought the $12 LGO salads were a lot. 

The beef bowl came out really quickly which was impressive given how busy they were. And it was....forgettable. Pretty tried of ordering anything that has rice in the list of ingredients and finding out that's the majority of what I'm getting. Rice with a few other things here and there. The meat was not cooked all the way, rather chewy. The cauliflower was nice and well seasoned. And then I was left with a huge bowl of rice to eat. I left a good amount of it there. I'm here to be healthy-ish right? Salad, I should've salad. I will salad next time and depending on how that goes decide whether to return again after that or stick with LGO."}
{"text":"We were very confused when we stood in line finally got to the order counter only for him to say you need a table number. Then we went to find a table and were told the hostess had to find it and give us the number. The hostess was no where to be found she was too busy there were a lot of people trying to order. No where did it say the hostess will get a table or do not order until you have a table. Finally we get a table get back in line get to the counter and the girl says I am going to help the large group behind you. No I told her we have been in this line three times. Needless to say we ordered and sat down. The food arrived and it was absolutely delicious! Just like our son described. Are we getting on in Tucson?"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, a great, healthy place for both vegans and non-vegans. The atmosphere is very pleasant. The employees are always so happy and delightfully kind. I wish I knew about this restaurant sooner."}
{"text":"Look the food is phenomenal, but when you leave spending $18 bucks for just your lunch and you got a wrap and a lemonade.....its hard its hard to get excited."}
{"text":"Wonderful! We had the Mediterranean salad, Kale salad, and the child's, you pick a protein and 2 sides. Everyone cleaned their plate! It is so nice to have a healthy restaurant with reasonable prices! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really good food but I wish they had the nutritional information for their food and Diet Coke.  Pop isn't healthy but it's nice to have when you're diabetic and not a tea drinker!"}
{"text":"I'd like to introduce you to a great new Fox Restaurant Concept, Flower Child. I attended the VIP soft opening on Friday, April 25th. Being extremely hungry my boyfriend and I ordered a LOT of food and enjoyed all of it. 

The avocado hummus was recommended to us and it was delicious. A combo of creamy guac and hummus with flax flat bread. For my meal I got a \"power bowl\" with grilled chicken. It is hard to impress me with chicken because SO many place do not add any flavor. This chicken had lots of herb-y flavor and was tender. My boyfriend ordered the avocado wrap and enjoyed it but wished he had gotten a power bowl. The reason the power bowl is amazing is because the vegetable sides are FANTASTIC. I got 3 with my bowl and my boyfriend ordered 2 sides. here's what we tried:

-Green Lentils, very tasty but nothing overly special
-Smashed Potatoes- AMAZING and perfect in every way
-Gluten Free Mac and Cheese- delicious and perfect because I am trying to remove gluten from my diet. The only complaint is that the spiral noodles were 1-2 minutes away from al dente meaning they were a bit crunchy. The sauce was delicious though.
-Chili Roasted Sweet Potatoes- Most flavorful thing on my plate and very unexpected. Sweet and spicy. Mmmm!
-Roasted Cauliflower with Curry spices- Also incredibly flavorful and perfectly cooked

We also tried the homemade lemonades (I sampled all 3) and the Kombucha. It was all delicious. My boyfriend loved the organic beer on tap and I cannot wait to try the wines! Finally, we tried the gluten free cookie and brownie. The cookie was delicious and moist. The brownie was too moist and rich and falls apart in your hands.

Overall, Flower Child gets 5 stars on food alone. The decor is nice although more garden themed and not as many flowers or hippie themed decorations as the name Flower Child might suggest. Actually, come to think of it, the name makes little to no sense... I should also mention that the portions are pretty small on the appetizer and power bowl. I foresee this being a problem for them given the pricing ($15 for a protein bowl and sides). I know some people will complain. I will DEFINITELY go back because of the flavorful, healthy options. I appreciate the gluten free, vegan, organic options immensely! There is a HUGE market for a fast casual concept like this in Phoenix. Hopefully they will consider opening a more central location in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place is always really busy and although it's really good, it's also really expensive for lunch. Nearly $20 for a salmon salad at a restaurant where you order at front, they give you a number, and then deliver it to your table. Don't get me wrong, really good but still spendy. The reason for the 4 stars is because the food is good and they make all their teas and lemonaides from scratch. They're delicious."}
{"text":"Seems like a good restaurant but... Waited forever in line then sat outside with the mister system useless and then got an upset stomach. 

I will probably give it another chance but not a good experience! 

And the bathroom had not been serviced enough to accommodate the crowd."}
{"text":"I get so excited to come to this place because I'm in the mood to be healthy. Then, I'm let down because the hole in my wallet is a little bigger and I'm hungry and unsatisfied. Maybe it's what I'm ordering. 

I have eaten the cauliflower, asparagus, cucumber/feta/quinoa salad, broccoli, chicken, the heirloom tomatoes (no longer on the menu), the sweet potato, and Mac and cheese. The only thing that would be worth getting is the Mac and cheese, and even that is questionable. Gluten-free does not mean that it's good for you (unless you legitimately have Celiac's disease), and maybe that is why people love this place. It's undoubtedly the tastiest thing in the menu I've had so far. 

It's either way too bland or way too seasoned (and SO overpriced) and I don't think anyone will admit it. Everything else, I can cook better at home. I only go there when I don't cook and wish to not feel guilty about what I'm eating at lunch. And that is what I'll keep doing until I get better at packing my own lunch (which is happening quick)."}
{"text":"Love flower child. The Food is very Fox concept. Love the atmosphere. Love everything."}
{"text":"We frequently get take out from this restaurant. I love it because it is easy and healthy. I particularly like the Forbidden Rice Bowl with shaved chicken. All the vegetables -- broccoli, beets, etc -- are crispy and delicious. This is a nice concept because you can design the dishes to your specifications. Great for the vegan in our family as well."}
{"text":"I'm torn in writing a review for this restaurant. I love the menu and healthy options. On one hand the vegetarian choices are 4 stars for sure, but anything with fish or meat leaves so much to be desired and is not over 2 stars on a good day. 

I've been here a few times and every dish I've had without meat has been awesome. Everything. However, I added salmon to one order and I received salmon with more than a dozen bones in it. I figured it was a fluke, but ordered steak the next time. The steak was so tough I couldn't chew through it, let alone swallow it. 

They are still new so I am hoping they will get their act together in terms of the meat. I the meantime, I'm not in a rush to try this place again, unless I feel like a strictly vegetarian dish."}
{"text":"shared a salad and a steak wrap here and it was delicious.  Salad slightly oily but it was good just the same.  Cute place too.  We ate outside which we enjoyed."}
{"text":"I had the Late Riser meal today and it was excellent.  The flavor and portion size were perfect and I felt energized verses fatigued after eating.  I enjoyed this meal so much it will be hard to try anything else on the menu.  The irony is it's one of the lowest priced items on the menu and considering all of the healthy ingredients, it's worth every cent.  Great job! I will be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! I had the flying avocado wrap and the pear pomegranate lemonade, I loved them both! The tea was very refreshing. The service was great and I liked how open the restaurant was and that they offered patio seating. One downside was the side of Mac & Cheese which was disappointing. It wasn't very flavorful and portion size was a lot smaller than expected. I will definitely return for the wrap and lemonade!"}
{"text":"Really good salads and the hummus is delicious! They have great options for beverages too. Can't wait to go back. 
Decor was really cool, different but unique."}
{"text":"Love the iced teas that are made fresh each day. The food is delish. However, mediocre service. Never enough tables."}
{"text":"The service is super friendly but I had the Sesame Beef bowl and the beef was cold cuts sautéed, tiny tiny little broccoli and a couple cauliflower flowerettes. Very disappointed in this dish.  Will not order again."}
{"text":"This is the typical Sam Fox restaurant with tasty food prepared with fresh ingredients and served by an attentive and considerate staff. It is healthy, too. So why just two stars? Because, like so much of what Sam offers, it is way, way overpriced -- and this time the value imbalance is just too much to ignore. The portions on our entree salads (quinoa with salmon) were remarkably small. My soup was amazingly good, but there was hardly anything in the bowl. I almost wanted to ask the server if she spilled it on the way to the table. The beer was a bargain at $5 a glass, but the overall bill for two was outrageous at $48. I felt as if I was paying Flower Child to help me lose weight (which I am doing just fine on my own). Sam, you are just too cheap on this one, and it's a shame. A similar but much better choice is Zoe's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Very good, healthy food. You can eat here with dietary restrictions such as gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian.  Gets busy and there is usually a wait.  Love the gluten free deserts, salads, and gf mac and cheese."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area for Christmas and were thrilled to stumble on this gem. The food was so good! It's hard to find healthy vegetarian options that taste good but they knocked it out of the park! They also had a great selection of fresh pressed juice that made for a fantastic breakfast the next day. It's not a cheap place to stop but worth every penny for such good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Kombucha on tap?! This place has enlightened me to new levels of hip-ness. The method of ordering and getting tables can get a little confusing for first timers, but this is a lovely restaurant with a matching atmosphere. Food is delicious and fresh, but it can be a little loud at the peak hours."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened and until recently the food was really top quality. Recently however I wonder if they changed cooks because the last 2 times I've found the things I used to love are now bland and tasteless. For one thing it seems like they took all the salt out and added things that I at least don't like. Sad for me because I loved this place before."}
{"text":"Me and my husband are vegetarian and we are in love with this place! Their Mother Earth bowl is to die for (not literally) lol but great customer service and environment!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I have a difficult time leaving Phoenix without stopping by Flower Child. The food, the vibes, the selection of local beers and house made iced teas; I love it all.
Most recently, I stopped by with my mom after an active weekend at the Grand Canyon on the way to drop me off at the airport. I realized we had time and the Flower Child on Camelback was on the way!
We stopped in a the space was big, bright and trendy. The girl at the counter was friendly. Like REALLY friendly. We ordered simple hummus with flat bread, my mom got a salad and I ordered the Thai cashew Quinoa with tofu. We spotted a table and claimed it quickly. I sipped on a local beer while my mom debated between 6 different delcious-looking iced teas and lemonades from fountains. 
The hummus came out quick and was simple, but delicious. Garnished with peppers and kalamata olives and accompanied with house made flatbread, we enjoyed it thoroughly.
Our entrees came out quickly after. My Thai cashew Quinoa was amazing! The flavor was savory and delicious and the tofu was expertly seared and perfectly flavored. My mom enjoyed her salad as well. 
If there was a flower child without an hour of my house, I would eat there several times weekly. Please open in Seattle!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today an it was fantastic!! I will definitely be back! The staff was knowledgeable of the menu an answered every question I had. I absolutely fell in love with this place!"}
{"text":"Always deliver more than expected. I have been to this location Many times and I have never had an issue. Always consistant and always quick and delicious despite the line out the door. 

The most recent experience showed just how customer focused they are. I had tried to order food for a big lunch that I was hosting through Panera and had a terrible experience. In a time crunch, I called Flowerchild and asked if they could process my order quickly. I ordered about 15 dishes and by the time I walked across the street from the hospital, the food was ready! They were so helpful and accommodating!

Thank you to the staff there!"}
{"text":"I was picking up food and saw the young man sweeping the dirty floors where the grill, counter, open containers with food all exposed to dirt . Doesn't anyone know that sweeping floors throws it in the air? It makes me think again about ordering food to go as you don't know if he was sweeping while your food is being repaired. Why not use hand held vacuums and pick up big food items with gloved hands and throw away gloves ..at least the air is cleaner.
I have been going there since the first day but until this is solved I will think twice..all places that serve food should take note."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much what you can call a regular for the place. I am obsessed with everything on the menu - well except the tie-dye wrap, but that's only because I'm not a tofu fan so I'm sure if I added chicken instead I would have liked it!

The staff is so nice and always welcoming. The food is amazing, and fresh, and comes out in a timely manner. 

I recommend this place for lunch or dinner! And definitely try to the sweet potatoes - they are life changing!

If you're a steak over, get the rebel with half steak, half chicken and add papa dew peppers. It's the best thing you'll ever have in-between a healthy home-made whole wheat and flax tortilla."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!
A great place to meet with friends, business associates or just grab something quick and healthy to eat. With a huge list of food sensitivities it's hard to find a welcoming and work friendly place.
Thank you Jake, for taking such good care of my associate and I!"}
{"text":"I just stopped by Flower Child for lunch today - I'm sure I'm not the first one to say it, but this place was packed. It's like Sam Fox found the perfect combination to make Phoenicians go wild. The line was way out the door, so I opted for the to-go option. 

I ordered the organic tofu & mushroom pho with shiritaki noodles, Thai basil, bean sprouts, jalapeño and lime. It was ready quickly and I received the broth and the fixings in separate containers - woohoo! 

While I was there the environment was great, it definitely lived up to it's name as a kind of flower-child-meadow-old barn feel. It was a big space. 

The mushrooms were big and meaty, and the tofu was well cooked and flavorful. My number one complaint is that the broth was way too spicy for me. I like spicy food, I like sriracha in my pho, but this was out of control. The jalapeño slices are cooked in the broth, and it didn't bring flavor, it just brought some really intense, tip of your tongue heat. It hurt to eat. It was so spicy it affected my speech. It was so spicy it still hurts now, an hour later. I can only imagine how spicy the spicy salmon nabemono is, if they bothered to label that as spicy. 

I do want to go back and order something else, because everyone else has said they had great food and really enjoyed it. I will update my review when I visit next time."}
{"text":"If your palette has been tainted by Kraft and you've given up on cheesy noodles, try one last time on their gf, realest mac-n-cheese because it is the best dang thing I have ever had! This place was the absolute bomb. If you are a locavore with a gluten-conscious mind, you need to stop in. We went on Memorial Day and it surprisingly wasn't crowded. My husband said he could literally hear the roar of this place from the parking lot during a regular work day. 
Decor was bright, happy and in an urban-farmer style. Every waitress was smiling as they walked around and served people. Trying the pomegranate and cucumber lemonades was fun and refreshing. The grain/veggie plates are like sides and you don't get as stuffed because not high fat or calorie so the price can seem high, but the food quality is amazing. 
We got the soba noodles with snap peas and non over-powering mint that were surprisingly cold but hecka delicious. The sweet potatoes were tender, carmelized and babied with some chili glaze and unnoticable Bok choy. I don't love kale, but I still loved the kale salad. It had enough flavor power to punch the bitter weedy flavor down and rise up together in texture and flavor."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying, I love flower child. It has the best, most fresh food in Phoenix and I've been coming here for years! The staff has always been so awesome and it's really felt like a community. I hate to say this.. but the vibe has changed. I used to see a very friendly environment between workers and management and that has gone down hill. I have lost a little respect because of the new manager. I have seen him be disrespectful to his workers, which I think is extremely inappropriate. I'd like to see more of a family environment. But as always, I love me a good Mother Earth and some Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Flower Child has been open for barely a couple weeks and already there is a line out the door when you want to grab lunch or dinner.  Good thing it's a healthy fast food focused restaurant.  True to their concept, even with a huge line, the man in charge is at the door helping guests get seated as quickly as possible (you'll know him because he looks like that guy from Ocean's 11).  The food is ordered at the counter and made by a line of employees and brought out to your table.

With a family full of allergies from milk, gluten to peanuts, I really do appreciate that Flower Child has so many dishes that can accommodate all of us.  On top of that, I'm constantly trying to eat healthier and I dig quality and healthy food - Flower Child hits the spot.

You can order anything from kombucha on tap, which is delicious (I'll take some to go) or there many flavors of lemonade (my son's favorites) to teas.  They even have some beer on tap but we recommend the kombucha.  Start with some avocado hummus, the sweet corn and pumpkin seeds were a good addition.

Try the Rebel sandwich and your taste buds will thank you.  The grass-fed steak is enticing and the rest of the ingredients really tie it together: port salut cheese, horseradish yogurt sauce and arugula.  The side salad was simple but worked well together.  We ordered the Asian Avocado salad, a favorite at the restaurant kale with creamy avocado, crunchy cucumber and sesame vinaigrette.

I'm a huge fan of their steak, I probably won't order any other protein from here again, I like it that much.  You can get the Vegetable and Grain plates with or without protein.  The salmon is pictured below, cooked well and kept plain so that it doesn't overtake the entire dish.  My favorite side (you must order it) is the creamy corn and quinoa.  I also really like the gluten free mac and cheese, red chili glazed sweet potatoes and Indian spiced cauliflower. 

I would suggest if you are going for dinner, you order the Madras Curry Chicken, I'll eat curry everyday and this one was surprisingly good. 

Let's not forget dessert, I always save room.  Their lemon olive oil cake and chocolate cupcake were moist and divine, the crostata was ok, compared to the other desserts, I felt it lacked zing.

I don't normally take dessert to go but I would seriously recommend that you do.  The brownie they have by the cash registers melts in your mouth, it is so good, I will not share with anyone.  The rice crispy treat, oatmeal raisin cookie and chocolate hemp cookies were all good but the brownie, oh that brownie!"}
{"text":"Refreshing, healthy, modern, clean and they have a great menu. The food was fast and most definitely better than any fast food place. The place was packed but the wait in line wasn't too bad considering. Very friendly staff and they will substitute or modify for those picky eaters out there."}
{"text":"I had the Winter Sunshine salad and my wife had the Mother Earth. Both dishes were superb. 

The flavors and texture of the salad were well balanced. Crunchy from the apples and almonds, hearty from the quinoa and the arugula lettuce added a nice pepper flavor."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that the seasonal roasted veggies were taken off the menu...  Bad call."}
{"text":"Got a sneak taste of the curry chicken. I usually like a hotter curry, but was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it tasted! Flower Child uses only the freshest ingredients that don't have GMO!!! Clean food! I have celiac and am always looking for restarsaunts that cater to gluten free choices. Absolutely a must go to for a unique experience!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, delicious and flavorful. Service was fast, friendly and courteous. Great little place for a fast and good lunch, had the Cobb salad with chicken and mango Iced tea. Seats are comfortable and if you have to wait there are flavored water stations. Nice place"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food and service. Can't give it five because of the price. Our lunch bill went over $60 with only 3 people. Maybe it's the rent or it's location, but there is no need to charge that kind of money for the food. All the staff was courteous and attentive for your needs. Everything we had was tasty and well plated. Probably won't be back as there are a plethora of places to spend our money."}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance and what a pleasant surprise. Super healthy food, great prices and atmosphere and my kids loved it. Now we just need one closer to home in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and thought it was pretty good. It was fresh and \"healthy\". I ate the flying avacodo wrap and my friend got a salad ( can't remember which one) but we both loved it. 
It wasn't cheap, but I personally don't mind paying for fresh, good food! The staff were knowledgable and suggested the wrap for me- everyone was chill & smiling. Nice environment."}
{"text":"Food is so delicious and healthy just the way I like it! You pick the salad and the protein that you want on it. Price is a little steep but worth the healthy meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lovely decor, impeccable service. 

Daily fresh juice, avocado turkey wrap (\"flying avocado\", I believe it was called."}
{"text":"It was the best vegetarian meal I've been trying for a long time. I liked the friendly staff when I collected my order. Fast and tasty, that's all you can say."}
{"text":"This place is getting a 5 for making my night! Thanks to Shawn for going above and beyond to make our dinner here the very best experience. In my books, it's all about customer service and this is one of the few places that has super kick ass service and friendly people. #favesies"}
{"text":"The place has a very astroturf-y, rich-hippy, limousine-liberal vibe that's all the rage from Scottsdale to Orange County to the Upper West Side.  That's not the worst thing in the world, but it is a bit eyeroll-inducing.  The main issue with this place, though, isn't the lily-white, one-with-the-earth-but-never-get-my-lulus-dusty atmosphere, it's the price point.  Even for the area, the price-to-portion-size ratio is way off.  Both times I've eaten here the food was delicious, but I've spent much more money than I'd expect to and still left the place hungry.  If they drop the prices, I'll be back. Namaste!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place.  Had the rebel and split a side of guacamole hummus with my wife, so so good.  Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant from the Fox group!  I have been in the restaurant business my entire adult life and I think the Fox group is the best I've ever seen.  
This concept features: Great fresh flavors delivered in a modern way. You will find a long line out the door waiting to get in.  A much better place than the Applebee's that was here before them.  Actually a great contrast of old and tired versus new and fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food and selection. I like all the options for vegan eaters that want variety. Usually we have to pick one or two options.
I had the Thai wrap and sweet potato side. Both were delicious and filling when eaten together. But the price for both is a bit much, but they can do it for this location."}
{"text":"My first time visiting flower child left me hungry and disappointed.  I'm fine paying for a good salad but the strawberry fields salad contained a small fist size of salmon and romaine lettuce when the description said arugula. The small black Togo container was the size of a frozen lean cuisine.  The salmon was tasty, but overpaying for a basic salad, not my style flower child, not for $15.  I'll pass."}
{"text":"Finally delicious, healthy, fresh food on the go. Excellent menu variety, well prepared, excellent service."}
{"text":"I'm usually a critic of Sam Fox's concepts but lately I'm developing a sympathy for them and Flower Child is helping.

A down to earth unpretentious cool spot with great service and good food for a fair price, what else can you ask for?

I had the asian avocado salad and the madras chicken curry.

Both pretty good. A little too much kale in the salad and little avocado if you ask my opinion, but all in all pretty solid.

I'll be back for sure.

Cheers"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very noisy. The lemonade was very good. I had order the flying  avocado. It was very good."}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh salads and a variety of veggies prepared with delicious sauces. They also have great protein options (steak, chicken, salmon and tofu). Ambiance is welcoming and clean, and the service is friendly and efficient. Once my take out was missing a protein and the next time I was there, I mentioned it and asked if I could get a credit for my protein. The manager was consulted and my entire meal was no charge! They never asked for a receipt and took my word for it. They take customer service seriously! I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Also used promo code \"Anton yoga\" and they gave 10% off from my purchase. My favorite is Vegan Poke."}
{"text":"This review is for all three locations but this is the one I probably go to the most. I LOVE this place! If I could give it 10 stars I would do so. Flower Child isn't just your average cafe with healthy options. Similar to True Foods, a lot of the dishes here are made with a unique combination of ingredients, spices, and fresh herbs that blend together perfectly. Unlike a lot of healthy food restaurants, everything I've tried on Flower Child's menu is bursting with delicious flavor. Coming from someone who loves cooking and doesn't eat out a lot, this is one of the few restaurants I will always give into when I am near one of the locations. As if the food wasn't good enough, customer service has also been constantly exceptionally good at all three locations in the valley. The cashiers/food runners always greet me with a smile and make me feel very welcome. If you are someone who likes good healthy food options with a lot of flavor then do yourself a favor and come here. My favorite Fox restaurant without a doubt!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing! The GM Lindsay is always so efficient and kind. The food is always so fresh and the steak is to die for. I love the vibe all the employees give off! Highly recommend eating here. Thanks to Jesse for making the best Mother Earth, as usual!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food and comfortable atmosphere for lunch. One tip- only do eat-in and not to go orders or you may be waiting til closing to be served"}
{"text":"Sorry, although I'm a frequent regular you have to call these things out.  After having wrap and avocado toast (both which were very good) I ordered a side of apple slices.  Cost - $4,39. What I got,  less than a quarter apple - six thinly sliced pieces.  Should a whole apple really cost $16?"}
{"text":"Overpriced and very loud like an elementary school cafeteria!  The food was good but it smelled of strong garlic inside and not great for lunch to relax and have a friendly conversation.  I felt stressed from the poor set up, the long line, and the loudness of it all.  I was looking forward to this opening for months and will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"This place is good. Very expensive for what you get. I think my favorite thing about Flower Child is the fresh lemonades offered."}
{"text":"One of the best interiors--they hired a top notch interior designer and great atmosphere.  Here for a conference and want to eat a 95% whole foods, plant based diet.  Will come here a few more times.  I had the Mother Earth bowl.  It wasn't a huge portion but just right for someone like me who wants just right.  You could taste the freshness of the ingredients and it was an excellent mix.  Will try a few more times to make sure my review is right.  Doesn't look like they have real juices but more teas.  They have meat too so this isn't really vegetarian or vegan but a great place to take someone who wants to eat healthy but still eat meat."}
{"text":"Just went from 5 to 1 stars b/c they don't recycle!  An entire restaurant, imagine their impact.  Not to mention their whole concept is healthy and earth conscious at this place (one of the kids books they have is about recycling!), but all their plastic cups go to a landfill.  What a disappointment and hypocrisy! No wifi btw!

Old review: 
So, I go a lot and my new fave salad is the Mediterranean (I tell them light dressing b/c they really can overdo it), and the Spicy Salmon entree.  Also, I like the soups (the chicken tortilla is fabulous) but I found the Pho, Veggie Bean Soup, and the Coconut Curry a bit too salty.  

Healthy, delicious, great staff and service, and really it does not get better.  MY FAVE and the best salad ever - Quinoa Salad!  Add chicken for protein.  Great kids meals that are healthy.  The Salmon Entree is delish!  For kids, the Quinoa-Corn and Mashed potatoes are great (although the quinoa corn is a bit sweet for me).  The wraps are great, my fave is the veggie and I add tofu to it.  Lemonades so good and use cane sugar.  It's the best!  Avoid going at the lunch rush b/c there will be a long wait."}
{"text":"Oh my GOODNESS! This food is fabulous! So fresh! I ordered the Mother Earth with chicken. Sooooo yummy! My friend had the Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl with salmon. She said it was the best salmon she had ever tasted! I will be back! Oh, the fresh lemonade is awesome! 3 kinds!"}
{"text":"Was told tonight that all the parties who came in after me would need to be seated before I could place a to go order. This was my first time, but I won't be coming back again. Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I got the Mediterranean salad with chicken. I gave this place 4 stars because it is pricey. But it's really good and healthy.  Two salads were $30, but that includes protein. You can feel yourself getting healthier with each bite . The ambiance was really nice. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot in Arcadia for quick and healthy lunch or dinner.  I've been here a few times and I appreciate the organic menu options.  I typically order the three side options ( vegetables & grains ) plus a protein and then a lemonade.  The tab for this is usually just under $20, which is why I visit only about 1x/ month.  The staff are always helpful and well informed, the ordering is quick ( if you don't visit between 11:45am - 1pm) and the food tasty.  If you are interested in visiting for dinner, Beer, Wine and Kombucha are available!

I would give a full five stars and visit more often if everything was $1 or $2 less.  Granted, they are in a high-rent area that is prime real estate near Camelback Mountain, Paradise Valley and the family-friendly Arcadia proper.  Parking can be an issue, arrive 10-15 minutes earlier than you are expected to get over the frustration.  With the negatives listed, I do enjoy the patio and the farm/country hippie feel of the cool open space."}
{"text":"I loved this place! While visiting Scottsdale, my husband and I stopped in for lunch after hiking the nearby Lost Dog Wash Trail. Delicious, healthy food! My avocado and turkey wrap was the best turkey I've ever had. Hubby enjoyed his sacred rice. If you are in the area, check this place out. It's really pretty inside, too! Reminds me a lot of Northstar Cafe which we have back in Columbus, Ohio. Love!"}
{"text":"What an incredible meal. From the moment you walked in, the staff could not have been more friendly or welcoming. 

We browsed the menu and made our selections, which wasn't easy because everything looked so amazing. The avocado toast was hearty with perfectly cooked eggs on top. Only suggestion my husband had would be to add a few fresh tomatoes, I could go either way with that. 

I ordered the Mother Earth with Salmon (5/5) and my partner ordered the Strawberry Fields with no additions (5/5). On the side we tried the Spicy Japanese Eggplant (top of our list!). 

We will absolutely be back, this area needed a restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"Great place a must go kind of place. From out of town looking for something different well I find it. Great atmosphere and very friendly. This place is so good if I lived here I would come often. The food was pretty and the so flavorful I was amazed. Wish I could eat more. Sooooo good. I had the beef bowl but substituted chicken and the kale salad. It was to die for, taking some home for a snack."}
{"text":"Very good food! I forgot to ask for my steak to be cooked a bit more but it was really good!"}
{"text":"Great concept!  Great food & friendly staff. A bit pricey but worth it!  I recommend this joint to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"It's like a hipster Tender Greens or Lemonade. The menu is original with excellent quality foods. I don't think you can choose an item and not like it. However, the menu is also difficult to understand HOW to read it. Definitely the place to go for a healthy meal and much cooler and tastier than anything they have at Whole Foods. Watermelon Lemonade tea is to die for. Too bad they don't package them and sell at the grocery store. Skinny Cobb salad is just amazing and I would eat it for lunch 2 days out of the week if I lived in AZ."}
{"text":"I am a Flower Child fanatic! You truly cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Each dish is a an amalgam of fresh vegetables, proteins, and mouthwatering sauces and garnishes. 

My favorites are the Mother Earth bowl, the Vegan Ingredient salad, and the gluten free Mac and cheese. They also have many flavors of fresh lemonade and iced tea. 

The prices are a bit higher than your average fast casual restaurant, but I believe the spectacular service makes up for it. We came today during the lunch rush and took our place at the end of a very long line. The employees made our wait much smoother by serving complimentary mango pineapple lemonade samples and offering to save us a table for our party ahead of time. 

I always leave satisfied knowing I had a healthy, nutritious and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I've developed a clear problem here; I feel like I need flower child every single day. The staff is unbelievably friendly and care 100% about your customer satisfaction. The food is phenomenal; I can finally follow my strict meal plan at a restaurant. I get the flying avocado frequently but you won't be disappointed with any choice... unless you like huge portions lol"}
{"text":"Food - 5/5
Service- 5/5
Atmosphere- 5/5
Price- 3/5

It is definitely expensive! The ingredients in your plate probably cost 1/10th of the cost of the plate, but this place sure is tasty! I am a fan but I wouldn't be able to eat this every day. Chipotle is around the corner ad you can get basically the same thing for half the price. A chicken + veggie bowl and iced tea was close to $20 

All in all, a tasty treat that is healthy"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect. It was great! It satisfied all of us from vegan to meat eaters.  We will go back!!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  I had the mother earth bowl ...yummmy! Great for anyone who is looking for a healthy and fresh vegetarian/vegan lunch in the area!"}
{"text":"Cuteness! Freshness! Modern! Adorable! So yum and healthy! This place is too cute! I love the adorable county/modern decor. The simple cute details are found everywhere from the cute fresh daisies as centerpieces on the tables, to the green walls in the bathroom , and clever use of mason jars to the blue woven chairs. The menu has extremely fresh/ organic/ delicious options. We stopped by for a quick snack and I had the avocado / hummus and pita such a fantastic light healthy snack and my madre had the broccoli and steak. The steak was very flavorful and must have been organic. I love how the Xavier kids hang here instead of a fast food joint . Making the point that they/ this quaint spot are highly evolved."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's simple and fresh. Absolute must try's are the eggplant, snap peas, and sweet potatoes (all side dishes). I honestly just get these when I go with some yummy gf mac n cheese or the quinoa and corn...flavors are on point. Love it."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this establishment. The restaurant itself is open and has a large seating area and patio seating. 
The lady who took our order was friendly and welcoming. 
Vegan options such as salads, plates and one wrap. Vegetarian options and  animal options."}
{"text":"The food is healthy and seasoned well, but $40 for lunch for two people is a little ridiculous. I wouldn't mind, but we were still hungry when we left. The portions are super small. I got chicken, smashed potatoes, and broccoli. I assumed Id get a whole chicken breast, but it was maybe half of one sliced thin. My husband got a wrap and a  kombucha to drink. I could've made the same meal at home, all organic, for way less."}
{"text":"This place is so precious; the food is delicious, the decorations are adorable, and the tea is out of this world. I've gone back twice already and will probably eat here regularly for as long as I live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  Love this place!!  Amazing iced teas and lemonade flavors.  My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I tried Flower Child for the first time today. I'm a huge fan of True Food Kitchen, so I thought I'd like this place as well. I was right. I ordered the kale salad, which was delicious! It had kale, grapefruit, apples, cheese, black currants and almonds. This salad captured everything your mouth could ever want. There was savory (chicken and cheese), sweet (apples and black currants), sour (grapefruit), crunchy (almonds and apples), soft/chewy (cheese and black currants).... Anyways, you get the point. It was delicious! I will definitely be returning to try something else.

If you're one that enjoys hot food, there aren't too many options. There is pho and some other soup options, but there isn't anything like a burger. I am not sure if the wraps are warm, or if you get a side of meat, such as salmon, chicken or steak, if those are warm or not either. This struck me more as a cold type of food restaurant. 

I am removing one star for the size or the salad I received for the price I paid. Although I was full after my salad, I paid $17 after tip for a salad with some chicken on it. I think that's pretty high, since it wasn't a huge salad and probably only had 3 ounces or less of chicken."}
{"text":"YUM! Perfect location and delicious healthy food. Staff was very friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They continue to deliver healthy, delicious, and creative dishes. Stopped by for lunch today with my daughter and I had their special: and heirloom bean \"burrito\" bowl. Amazing. Quinoa, brown rice, beans, avocado and much more. So good! My daughter had the Brussels and squash salad with. O ancient grains so it was GF. Wow. Th chia see vinaigrette was incredible and the apples, cranberries, sprouted almonds and goat cheese made this her \"favorite salad ever,\"she said. Service was great and even though very busy, everything was great."}
{"text":"Fab good, staff and ambience. Quick, efficient and very tasty dishes available, their lemonades are broad in flavors too."}
{"text":"Delicious! I purchased and devoured the Flying Avocado and the Strawberry Fields Salad. The dried mulberries in the Strawberry Fields Salad was an exceptionally delicious added crunch which I now prefer over Croutons. My meal was flavorful and hearty. I left satisfied and full of energy. I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Wonderful healthy fast casual restaurant. Everything here is delicious and they change their menu based on what is in season. 

My go-to is the grains plate with salmon, gluten-free Mac n cheese, and Brussels sprouts. When the sprouts aren't in season I'll switch to the sweet potatoes. 

For something lighter their salads are perfectly portioned. All of them are wonderful!

Be sure to try their fresh lemonade as well!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with Flower Child. It is the perfect option when you want some delicious healthy food! You can tell how much care goes into eat and every meal. My favorite is to get the grains plate and you can mix and match different options. I always lean towards the salmon, brussel sprouts, and sweet potatoes. I will also switch it up and get their amazing gluten-free mac & cheese! When I am on the go I will grab a flying avocado wrap but honestly you can't go wrong with anything!

Be sure to get a house squeeze lemonade too :] YUM"}
{"text":"Great experience and food. We asked for the Chef and he spent time with us to explain the Restaurant's philosophy on food sourcing and his passion for nutritious plates. Would definitely go back. Short drive from the airport and worth while the detour if you are heading towards Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Killer fresh Salads and much much more.
All the Vegans and  non fatties come here for the healthiest Food in the area. I dined with the ghost of Don Rickles and split my guts wide open !!!  They only use farm fresh veggies and fresh fantastic Fish ! If Dean Martin shows up ima gonna craps me pants !!!"}
{"text":"this is a very good place to try out if your trying to eat on the Health side the food is full of junk the menu is a little had to under stand at first just because everything is add ons witch make it a little pricey and the portion are small for what you get your not hungry anymore but your not full either that's good if got trying to loose weight device wasn't  that good it was my first time there the girl that took my order was just pushing me thew the line because I wasn't to sure how to order again menu a little confusing I think I order the forbidden rice I think she was pushy so I just pointed at something will try it again if I am around  oh ya there drinks are grate no soda all fresh made teas and lemons aids I like the watermelon lemon aid"}
{"text":"First visit today with spouse.  Order the Avocado Hummus and it was out of this world.  Came with warm flat bread for $7.  Yum!  Main course was the Skinny Cobb with grass fed steak protein.  Total cost was $14.  Plenty of food, very tasty and would order again. Also ordered Mother Earth with Salmon protein for $16.  Very good! Some may say its a little pricey but you get what you pay for.  Ingredients are locally grown and the food was very fresh.  I counted 13 workers behind the counter.  By the way, its very casual so place you order at the counter and they will deliver the meal to your table.   No tip necessary. They offer salads, plates, bowls and wraps.  Very healthy eating and good for you! They also offer wine, beer and variety of teas. Looking forward to return!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food with great, healthy ingredients. Reasonably priced and usually pretty quick. I recommend the rebel wrap, are usually order it as a bowl. Great tea and drink selections as well."}
{"text":"Like flower child. Come here often for a quick dinner after work. Food and service are usually very good. 

I would give higher scores if not for the \"Hummus Situation\"

- they have a cool option on the menu to mix n match 1-2-3 sides ($4-$7-$9) and add a protein ($varies). One of these options is hummus. Here's the catch, if you order the hummus here as a side, they inform you they don't serve it with Pitta, and that to get anything to dip into the hummus other then your protein, you have to order the hummus appetizer ($6). 

Rub is they are charging $4 for pitta, on a $6 appetizer. Here is how:

If I don't do the pick three ($9) and do the pick two ($7) and then add a pitta app ($6) my bill goes from $9 to $13, or a $4 swing for a few pitta slices...

Here's the thing, if they sold pitta for a $1 side, I would buy it everytime... seems the \"system can't do this\""}
{"text":"The mother earl bowl here is EVERYTHING. Seriously, don't even look at the menu and just order this to start. I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend also loves this bowl with the salmon on it. Everything is fresh, healthy, and fast- what more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Cute and trendy decor. All about the healthy food, but this just feels like another chop shop with flavorless dishes"}
{"text":"I've been to Flower Child a few times so I feel like I can write a fair review. Overall the entrees I've had have been great, though the portions are sometimes on the small side for me. A couple visits the protein I ordered (chicken) was disappointingly lukewarm. Others with me have experienced this too. On the positive they have unique and delicious sides like chili sweet potatoes, creamy quinoa corn, and beet citrus avocado salad. However, sides from the \"mix and match\" section or other small extras bring the cost up quickly and the total can become pricey for a fast casual restaurant like this. On the plus, the ingredients are fresh, and organic is often used (I saw organic labels on items in the kitchen) and there is a good selection of vegetarian options too. Also, staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"I love the food and the vibe here.  I've been on repeat occasions, and everything I've ordered has been really tasty.  The drink choices are a plus too - including kombucha on tap and the creative iced teas.  The only drawback for me, and the reason for the missing star, despite loving the place otherwise, is the pricing.  It's definitely overpriced, especially for the portion sizes.  If you want a full meal, you usually have to order a couple things, and the bill winds up being pretty ridiculous for a casual order-at-the-front type of place.  But other than that, it really is a cool place."}
{"text":"I spent $22 on a salad and a drink and a side of mashed potatoes. (See pictures)
I could have gotten the same type of salad and drink for much less at Panera or salad and go. I ordered what I wanted and when he told me the Total I about fainted.  That is so ridiculous I won't be back because of the high prices.  I got the Mediterranean salad which was good but small for the price.  The mashed potatoes are good but holy cow, for the price it was not enough.  And a large drink was $3.50.  This size drink is about 16 ounces.  For $2.50 I could get a 32 ounce iced tea at Panera.  Come on! Give me a break! These prices are outrageous."}
{"text":"Flower child is always reliably good. I know I can get something I will really enjoy, and eat all of, every time. They are very fast also. We get our food in like 10 minutes after ordering. Sometimes there's a long line when we get there but it moves very quickly. My favorite things are: lemon olive oil muffin, chocolate chip cookie, flying avocado wrap (surprisingly good flavor), and the sides steak, smashed potatoes, corn, Mac n cheese. The rebel wrap is really good too, but only if you're a fan of horseradish!"}
{"text":"Ordered ahead online and sat for 23 min waiting for my food...that had actually been sitting on the counter the whole time but no one took the time to look at my name. I waited so long...for toast with avocado on it mind you, that by the time I ate it the avocado had started turning brown. Food= great! NOT impressed with the service."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food. Fresh ingredients, happy friendly staff. Goes to show how fresh organic, healthy food can never go wrong. Cool concept. Scenes a little yuppie 
(But that's ok!) and prices are pretty steep-- again, fresh produce is expensive. 

The manager (I think he's the manager) gave my niece a flower (such a nice gesture) and was so lovely to us and the entire room (staff like that really set the tone for a great dining experience).

If you're looking for quality food, friendly service and are not too concerned about price, Flower Child is DOPE. Get the vegan caesar with chicken or the flying avocado wrap (delicious). 

You'll leave this place happy and not overstuffed."}
{"text":"Food is excellent...but quite pricey. I typically pay about $16 just for lunch entree, add a drink and it's close to $20. All deserts are gluten free, which is a bummer that they're such slaves to a food fad."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place! It's so cute and darling! They have some really nice little touches such as the art on the walls, yoga mat \"parking\", and customer hand washing sink. They also served beer and wine. Win!

I had a skinny chopped salad and added salmon to it. My hunny had steak mac and cheese with side of broccoli. I had a wine and he had a water. The grand total was $45. It's definitely a bit overpriced but the way I justified it is that it's dine in restaurant quality food and price and a fast casual dining experience. The food was delicious! I'm on a strict diet and was surprised at how many options there were. Everyone that worked there was really friendly and our service was great.

The only other downside besides the price was that there were bones in my salmon. Beyond that it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Today was my 1st visit and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Kale salad & Flying avocado wrap. Large portions and delicious!  The employees were knowledgeable and friendly and I will definitely be returning as often as possible :)"}
{"text":"If you like healthy food this isn't the place . If you like good food this isn't the place . They have failed miserably . Toast was hard plain piece of bread with avacado on top . Eggs made with water salmon is pre frozen broccoli as well . Wouldn't recommend this to a dog ."}
{"text":"Was on a date with the wife and she wanted to go to flower child, not my idea of a fun restaurant. Asked the young lady what is good and she recommended the mother earth bowl. I told I was having not part of something named the mother earth bowl so she recommended the Thai Cashew quinoa Bowl. I must say it was really amazing. Everything we had was really amazing. The chocolate pudding is a must. The food, atmosphere and people are great. I highly recommend Flower Child. We will be back again on Sunday."}
{"text":"One of our fave places to eat, love the healthy options and use of organic food. The cauliflower is to die for! My husband and I eat really clean and it's nice to have some great restaurants to go to for this type of menu. Only 4 stars because it's a little too pricey though. Yum!"}
{"text":"I ate here today with a girlfriend, we were out for a nice lunch and some local antique shopping.  What a wonderful place!  The food was amazingly delicious,  fresh,  and healthy!  I had a grapefruit mimosa...  The best I have ever tasted... 

I live in Ahwatukee,  but will definitely be adding this to my short list of favorite spots for a delicious,  healthy food with a super hip vibe! 

Thank you Flower Child!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been fantastic!  If you're interested in what you're are eating, and where it comes from, this is a fantastic place to grab a quick bite to eat. Grass fed beef, tons of vegetarian/vegan options, great variety. Maybe my favorite thing about this place is there's NO Soda, just tea and lemonade, raw sugar or stevia.  No will power is wasted here while eating delicious healthy foods. Big fan!"}
{"text":"The flavors at this place were magical...very vibrant; balanced acidity, sweet, spicy, salty. They definitely know how to use citrus at this place. Staff was great about working around my food allergies and preparing a \"special \" meal with care. The sweet potatoes are a must. Just do it. They've got kombucha on tap as well as several homebrew lemonades. The entire table was satisfied,  and it was a difficult crowd in which to please all of eaters, including my \"I only eat beige food\"  niece!  Clean, fresh prepared food. Go there.  Go there now."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always fresh and made with a quickness. Right now they have a white peach seasonal lemonade and it is so delicious. With 3 different lemonades to choose from and 3 different types of tea you will find something you like. Food was cooked right except my steak was slightly over cooked."}
{"text":"This healthy-oriented salad / wrap place is great for lunch with its large windows, open-air ambiance (although I had to take my order to go, I would have loved to stay and eat!). I love how well lit this place is! Adds to the earthy feel they are going for. Inside decor is cute and comfortable, and the servers are friendly. This place has an artsy feel to it as well. 

I got the Grains and Green salad with tofu and it was really tasty. The only downside is that they don't give you a large portion so you may leave hungry despite paying over $10 for the meal. Close to $20 if you get a salmon add-on. The tofu isn't too greasy (and it's organic!). My brother got the Indian inspired bowl but it didn't have rice on it. 

If you're looking for a healthy place to eat this is it! It definitely qualifies for \"clean eating.\""}
{"text":"Very good And fresh food, just wish the portion sizes were a little bigger for the price. But great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix this past holiday, visiting family and friends. We had people in our family fly in from Hawaii, Utah, San Francisco, etc. 

I wish I had known about this place (or was it even open then?) when i lived in Phoenix many moons ago! Regardless if you need to/prefer to eat gluten-free, vegan, whatever, I can guarantee there is something to satisfy your savoring! 

We stopped in a couple nights before leaving Arizona and it wasn't crazy busy. Perhaps, it was because it was right between Christmas and NYE, but we weren't complaining! The food came out quickly and presentation was nice. Better yet, the food was delish!

Bird is the Word Wrap was my choice - so yum! Other things we ordered like the Organic Kale Salad, Mother Earth Bowl, Grass-Fed Steak w/ chopped vegetable salad....etc. 

Totally going back next time I'm back in PHX."}
{"text":"Good food, healthy, and reasonably priced.  The grilled brussel sprouts rock.  The kids meal is great and surprisingly filling.  They also have a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but pricy for the portion size and the service. I had chicken curry it was delicious, $13 plus another $4 for a side of brown rice that amounted to about  1 cup of rice. No wonder the restaurant is at 30% capacity on a Friday night. My friend had the Thai wrap, she was told its not spicy, I tasted the food, it was medium hot. Tried it once, that's enough, not going back."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER ON LINE!!! Ordered on line to cut down on wait. After I drove around for 15 minutes looking for parking like everyone else,  I stood in line for an additional 10 minutes in the To-Go Line only to be told they didn't have my order. I was asked for the Comfirmation Email, which was never sent. Order & payment were not made. So, since I was already there after wasting most of my 60 minute lunch hour, I placed a To-Go order & waited an addtional 10 minutes.  After all of this hassel, I get back to my office & have 5 minutes left to scarf down what I would consider Sub-Par hipster crap that wasn't worth my time or frustration. My \"Experience\" might have left me a bad for this place. 
Only pro, it was fresh & healthy. 
All cons are listed above.
Would I recommend this place to my friends? Only with the disclaimer.... Don't order & pay on line. Ride your bike, there's no parking. It's a great place to be seen, especially if your a knit cap sock head with a beard,  because man buns were so 2015."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place . I have been here over 50 times. My favorite dishes have to be the mothers earth with salmon, late riser with shredded chicken, and flying avocado"}
{"text":"Absolutely exquisite food made with wholesome ingredients. I was in town for a week and frequented this place through the duration. My girlfriend and I loved customizing our dinner with the plethora of side options and proteins. A delicious meal that you don't feel bad about afterwards! The steak, chicken, and salmon are all quite delicious. We especially loved the sweet corn and quinoa, gluten free Mac n cheese, and the chili glazed sweet potatoes. And of course we had to indulge in gluten free chocolate almond cake. So moist and delicious.  Please Please Please open a restaurant in Orange County, CA. There isn't anything quite like this and I know it would do very well given our demographic. We certainly would eat here regularly and are sad to have just eaten there today for our last time on this trip."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot! Seriously amazing fresh and healthy food! Must try the flying avocado. Many reviews doubting the price but it's actually reasonable for what you get! For how good this place is they are always so busy and I think the staff does a very good job still delivering fast and effective service!"}
{"text":"The service at this place was great and it was nice to go to for a casual lunch. It's very similar to what you would experience at a Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery. 

I feel like, because of the location of this restaurant, all of the staff have to look a certain way and most of the customers seemed pretentious. The dress code may consist of yoga pants and/or at least some type of workout gear to prove that you belong here. I think that this comes with going to restaurants that are geared toward this type of crowd, so not really unexpected in my opinion. 

I ordered the Skinny Cobb salad with grass fed beef and added a small iced tea. The salad was very good, however the $19 price tag was a little shocking to me. I have been to many restaurants and I understand the health conscious trendy vibe this place is known for, but $19 for a salad and iced tea was enough to make this place a special occasions type of restaurant for me. If money were no object I would probably be a semi-frequent customer."}
{"text":"I visited the other day and was delighted to see the flavorful options for salads, bowls and wraps. I had the flying avocado without tomatoes, the lemon olive oil cupcake and tea (I can't remember the flavor but it was tart and tangy simultaneously).

The wrap was a generous portion and came with a side of greens. I am glad it had the greens as the wrap looked a little flat without them. I like my wraps with lots of crunch. There were many other items that looked tempting and I would have chosen them except for the fact that I am allergic to mushrooms.

The lemon olive oil cupcake was moist and perfectly cooked. It also came with a nice light glaze drizzled on top.

The decor is similar to the trendy farmhouse organic yuppie but charming.  I would have sat inside but the music was a little bit loud. However, the outside patio was the perfect setting for the spring day.

The line increased as lunch drew near and the only downside would be the limited amount of immediate parking. There is a large shopping center adjacent and one could park there and brave the cross traffic.

The value for the food was a little pricey but not uncommon for the area.

As many other yelpers have asked, if they open one in Chandler, I will return."}
{"text":"This is one of my new Fox Restaurant favorites, filled with healthy and delicious menu options. I have ordered through Door Dash and have had no issues. I love their vegan options and use of organic and gluten free ingredients. My favorite is the olive oil cupcake and the marsala tofu bowl. But really, you can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy, trendy restaurant. I love the location, the price, and the variety of healthy vegetarian options. There are always great, fresh juices stocked for when I want to quickly run in. The line is never too long and the dining area is always so clean. I love the patio space as well. The food is consistent with every visit and comes out in a timely manner. I love that the menu is always adding fun new items and that the items are easily modifiable. I always bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the chopped salad with salmon. You can definitely tell the salmon is fresh and not treated with anything questionable. Plus the salad has a really refreshing, citrus dressing that smothers a bunch of crunchy veggies."}
{"text":"The food itself is excellent, and I love the restaurant's vibe and decor, but the price and quantity was not agreeable to me.  I ordered madras curry with tofu, and I was surprised that I had to pay an extra $4 for the tofu.  From my perspective, tofu should be the \"basic\" option with the choice of upgrading to chicken or steak for an extra cost.  I don't mind splurging on good food, but the amount of food served was also lacking such that I cannot justify spending ~$13 for a meal that barely made a dent in my stomach.  I walked out feeling \"healthy\" but also very unsatisfied and still very much hungry.  For the average eater who wants good food and is financially conscious, this place may not be a good regular spot."}
{"text":"I've been here too many times. It's so yummy and it makes me feel good that I'm eating healthy and gluten free. Very reasonably priced as well. Great for carry out."}
{"text":"I originally went here to get a Fox gift card, but while waiting I took a look a their menu and decided I should grab lunch here one day.  Fast forward about a week... I stopped by to grab lunch.  It was a few minutes before 11:00 (they open at 11), so I waited outside along with a few other people.  While waiting, I (along with some others) observed a hostess or other female employee inside look out the window of the door, throw her hands up and exclaim, \"Why is there a line outside!  We don't serve breakfast!\"  So that wasn't cool.  I almost turned around, got in my car and went somewhere else.  Having people waiting to come in to your restaurant is a good thing, right?  So despite that negative impression, I waited until they opened their doors at exactly 11:00 and ordered a wrap to go.  Took some time, as expected, but the sandwich/wrap itself wasn't bad.  The rest of their menu looks good - I'm just not as eager to return after seeing how unenthusiastic a certain employee or two were about having eager customers waiting to enter their restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Food is awesome! Had the sautéed spinach, mash potato, and cauliflower with chicken. Salads are yummy too."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place - being that we don't eat meat. When we went, we paid over $25 for a wrap and 3 sides.  The 3 sides were so SMALL.  We got the cauliflower, which we literally got 3 florets - now, they tasted amazing, but come on, 3 florets!? We also got the noodles, which was in a super small side cup, we finished in about 5 bites.  Then we had the mashed potatoes which they threw on the plate and it ran under the other 2 side cups, it just looked like 2 tablespoons of runny mashed potatoes - but they tasted great!  The wrap was very good, just so SMALL.  We were just disappointed and felt like they were definitely taking advantage of the area, thinking people will pay such high prices for such little amounts of food.

*Note this an order at the counter and site and wait for your food to come out with your number - like Paradise Bakery or Wildflower.

Unfortunately, we left here thinking, ok where are we going to go for dinner now?  So we won't be back, which is sad."}
{"text":"Gluten free options!

Have been here several times and for causal dining really do enjoy it.  Besides gluten free options they also have vegetarian and vegan.  You can pick from different bowls, wraps, salads, soup and various sides.  The gluten free mac and cheese is something I get every time.  It's a rather small side, but prepared nicely.  Have tried the forbidden rice bowl with shaved beef.  It's been consistently good as is the Rebel which is a grass fed steak wrap.  Tried the madras curry with steak added, but wouldn't repeat that one.  It has more potatoes than anything.  The Kombucha beverage is very tasty.  They even have several gluten free desserts.  Have tried the brownie and lemon cake, both warrant repeats.

This is a place where you order your food at the counter then grab a table and they bring your order to you when it's ready.  The dishes have always been served hot.  Know that it is an incredibly noisy restaurant to visit so no relaxing here.  Would be nice if they invested in some noise reduction materials in the ceiling.  They only have two bathrooms that are unisex, but they are usually clean."}
{"text":"Could eat at this place every day. Went for the opening and though it was busy, the team worked like a well oiled machine. Just busting out food without even seeming stressed. Tried the asparagus, cauliflower, and Japanese eggplant. Girlfriend got the vegan poke. Everything was delicious and fresh. Came back the next day it was so good. Put this one in your regulars."}
{"text":"This is a cool place.  Really; the only downside is how crowded it can get.  Food's great, and there's lots of variety."}
{"text":"Good food. Good ambience. Very healthy. Nice selection of tea and lemonade.  Disgustingly small portions though. Good spot for a LIGHT lunch."}
{"text":"Food tastes great, staff was great, and nice decor. Unfortunately I can't leave more than 2 stars to a place I'll never return to. 
I'm definitely not cheap. I eat out daily, and have no problem spending $70 on a great steak dinner. 
This is a fast casual concept, not a full service restaurant. I get a bowl with under 3oz of chicken (the cheapest meat on the menu) for $14. Yes, it's all
non gmo, organic bla bla. Yet I can get more than double the amount of non gmo chicken at chipotle for $6.50, and barely finish my meal. I was VERY hungry when I left Flower Child, and had to immediately purchase more food elsewhere. My wife easily finished her meal, and she takes home half
at most any other restaurant. 
I'm fine paying a premium for quality product, which Flower Child definitely has, but over double the price for half the protein is unacceptable. I feel that around $8 for their bowls with chicken included would be right about the right price. $14 is pushing the price to its absolute limit. If the price was right, I would eat here every week, but at the current prices, I unfortunately will never return. -3 stars for being a terrible value."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Flower Child. It was amazing. The food fresh and interesting. The taste superb. Something for everyone in your party. Began, dairy free, gluten free, or full on carnivore, whatever they got it.
And they make their own Kombucha."}
{"text":"Need proof that everything Sam Fox touches turns to gold? Look no further than flower child, the next latest and greatest from this superb restaurateur. 

They have a sweet selection of teas and lemonade drinks. I love to mix the black tea with one of their watermelon or rose lemonades. 

For the entree, I get the cashew chicken bowl with forbidden rice. For the bowls, you can pretty much mix and match with the veggies of one, the sauce of another, and the rice/quinoa of another. They never act like this is a big deal either, which speaks to their level of customer service. Then you pick a protein. I've never had any of their wraps, but just a couple bits of others' in my party. 

What I will say is that this place is pricey. Yes, all of their stuff may be organic and top notch quality, but don't be fooled by the fact that it's a walk-up order type of restaurant, you will still pay typical restaurant prices. This is great if you want to have this as takeout for work, which many of their customers do. 

The patio is dog friendly and has misters. 

The kids menu allows you to pick a protein and a couple sides (ranging from mac and cheese to healthier options like apple slices and a clementine).

Also notable: though it has never been an issue for me, some of the people I've dined with have complained about the noise level and the difficulty hearing."}
{"text":"They have my favorite, a poke bowl! Bae comes here for food all the time, it is right by his place and since he became vegan, he likes that they have great veggie heavy meals with brown rice. It's also walking distance from his place so it's become a staple. I'm not a particular fan, but when I saw they had a poke bowl I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did. The space is big and very chic. I love the decor and there's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. You can order at the counter or sit down and they do to go orders as well. The poke bowl is super tasty. I got the bowl with just veggies, you have to pay extra for tofu and didn't think I would need it. The bowl had lots of avocado and veggies and was super fresh only thing is it didn't leave me feeling very full (maybe if I had gotten tofu). I understand why Bae likes the food so much. It is very high quality food and thoughtfully made. They use a lot of vegetables and combine the different flavors in a way that is unique and creative. I loved the bowl and would come back here again, just wish it wasn't so pricey ."}
{"text":"We visited Flower Child on our most recent visit to Arizona. I've wanted to go there in the past but never made it there until this trip. Let me just say, we WILL be back!
Everything about it was perfect. The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant was clean and obviously well run, and the food was outstanding! I had The Flying Avocado bu there were many other things on my he menu that I can't wait to try!
It's so nice to have this type of restaurant that serves food that's actually healthy!
My only complaint is that there isn't a Flower Child location in Chicago!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Everything I've had here, I've enjoyed. I usually get the quinoa bowl with steak or chicken or one of the wraps. The restaurant also has a really nice atmosphere and it great to dine in when the weather's nice. I'm a fan of the free cucumber water. 

Only thing that bugs me a bit is the price. Yes, I know given the food's organic, gluten free, etc. that it will cost a bit more. But it still feels kind of pricey for what's essentially a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food at this establishment. Fresh, tasty, and quickly hand delivered by very friendly staff. I'll definitely be back here during my lunchbreaks!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I had this restaurant on my radar for a while because of the vegan options; but, for a year, I never built up enough motivation to actually try it out because the menu seemed boring. How wrong I was!!! I ordered the Thai Dye wrap (vegan) and my husband got the Madras Curry (vegetarian; I believe there was yogurt in the mix). Both options were NOT boring, instead they were very aromatic and delightful. Helpful hint, the curry needs to be stirred up to spread the sauce onto everything. Although the price is a bit high ($13 and $10) I still left feeling full and satiated. They also have beer and wine options so it's a nice place to go with a group, split some appetizers, and enjoy some beverages! The inside décor is cutsie-hipster and there is a lot of seating options (indoor and out) so it seems like a place where you can go with a larger group! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Gluten Free, Vegetarian, Vegan...they have it all! Their kale salad is delicious. Everything is so fresh. Their lemon cakes/muffins are to die for - I highly recommend. Love their selection of lemonades - there is always something different. Low-key, relaxed atmosphere - great for a quick lunch.

If you are going for lunch, I highly recommend getting there around 11 as it gets packed."}
{"text":"I loved my lunch at Flower Child today! The decor is bright, airy and casual. The ordering set up and seating is much like Panera. You order your food at the front counter where you're given a number and an empty cup to fill your beverage.

Next, you pour your drink at the self serve station and grab your utensils before selecting your table. 

Pros - Fresh, healthy food at extremely reasonable prices. We had quick and friendly service as well. The menu has a wide variety of options for health conscious folks. In addition, I liked that there were both indoor and outdoor seating options. 

Cons - For beverages there's really only tea, lemonade, water and a limited selection of alcohol. Personally, I like a few more beverage options. Another \"con\" I thought was that you tip your server before you are even \"served\" due to the fact that you pay first. I like tipping after my meal as I gauge my tip on the service I receive. 

Overall, it's a great new spot and I will certainly return. Our food was fresh and tasted great --- not to mention you can't beat the reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"We found them on yelp. Visiting from out of town. The food was amazing and the service was great. I love the focus on clean food. In town for a couple more days and will eat here again at least one more time."}
{"text":"The name pisses me off, but the avocado hummus is bomb. The owner is a doosh, but the avocado hummus is bomb. Chicks working there are hot, and the avocado hummus is bomb."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! I like the selection, I like that common allergens are clearly declared. We ordered our food with a very nice clerk, he was attentive and made us feel like we're truly welcome. The food was all fresh and very yummy. I like, that they use quality ingredients only. Large selection on ice tea and lemonade. Definitely this restaurant is going to be one of my first picks in the future for lunch or dinner outings."}
{"text":"I come to Scottsdale quite a bit for work and always stop in to this place.  Good, HEALTHY food at a solid price.  Serving sizes are just right and service is always good.  

To the owners of Flower Child, consider opening one in Denver b/c I can assure you it would do great there."}
{"text":"I gave this place another shot. Pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the curry bowl....it was very good. The staff was polite and made me feel welcome which is what patrons look for in a restaurant.  The one part I didn't care for was the $4 fruit to go that was barely a handful of fruit in a plastic container.... an entire apple would of been more fruit then what I was given). Lesson learned. The curry I would order again in a heartbeat..."}
{"text":"Flower Child reminded me a fancier version of Lemonade or Tender Greens. It's a fast-casual place where you order first then grab a table. I went at 2pm, and there was still a steady stream of people. 

Food was delicious - I loved everything I got: sweet corn and quinoa, eggplant, cauliflower, and chicken. My friend got the lemonade, which is self-serve. I got the kombucha on tap, which was good but not as carbonated as I like it. I thought the portions could be a little bigger for the price, but I'll still be back. The decor was very french cafe, and their food was great quality."}
{"text":"How amazing.  Absolutely delicious fresh food.  It's nice to go out and not feel guilty for what you're eating.  I had the mother nature bowl or something of that sort. The grains were perfect and all the flavors went so nicely  together.  My hubby had the early riser... he liked it; which i was happy about since he doesn't really do veggies. The kombucha on tap was delicious with just the right amount of bubble. 
It was so busy and so crowded,  and so loud...i would usually take a star away for all that but it is so worth it I think it deserves the 5 star rating. 
I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Delicious, nicely structured menu (for those who like to minimize or forego starches and/or pick a protein to go with a variety of creative veggie dishes - counter order is delivered to pleasantly misted patio tables beneath striped umbrellas. Delightful butternut squash with mulberries, nuts & herb for example... cauliflower-curry Thai basil soup was excellent, non-dairy, but some veg can be over cooked/greasy/salty"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! I don't even know what to get every time I come here because EVERYTHING is just so darn delicious! Also, the variety of house made juices and teas are so good too. Again, I never know which flavor to pick. I love that it's fast, delicious and healthy here. What more can you ask for?!?!"}
{"text":"The food here is quite tasty. I had the Madras Cashew Curry with chicken and tried some of the dishes that my mother and sister ordered, one with tofu and one with salmon. All of them had very nice balanced spices and high-quality ingredients. The service was prompt and accurate; it's an order-and-sit arrangement."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, but as a lover of food, meh... I go to appease her but genuinly dislike the flavors and selection."}
{"text":"I love Flower Child for lunch but be prepared to wait in line for awhile depending on the time of day you go. If you get there between 11:30-12:30, the line can easily be 10-15 minutes just to order. The food itself is great and they have lots of vegetarian, vegan, dairy free, and gluten free options! I frequented this place while doing the Whole30 because they are very accommodating! I love their Mother Earth Bowl and the option to add protein if you want it. Also, their teas and lemonades are delicious!! I love having choices and they definitely give you plenty! I've never tried this place for breakfast or dinner but I think the portion size might be a little too small for dinner. The staff is always very friendly and the wait to get you food after you order is never too long."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place!! Their food is fresh and fast and their tea selection is superb (try mixing the black tea with the Rose petal lemonade- so good). I love all the gluten free options... especially the dark chocolate gluten free brownies!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE :)"}
{"text":"Since its opening at 90th St & Shea, Flower Child has quickly become a favorite spot of ours. We visit usually 2 - 3 times per week; whether it's picking up lunch, or dinner on a busy night, we are always so pleased with the food and service. I feel good knowing that they use healthful, high quality seasonal ingredients, although I'd be even more happy if they offered wild caught salmon and organic chicken & beef. I know it would cost more, but if it's a priority to a customer then they'll usually pay for it. I would pay the extra. As it is, I only purchase vegetarian meals, but would love the option to add WC salmon. Speaking to the service, it can be a bit slow at times when dining in, but I just see that as hopefully due to many items not being pre-made. The staff is always friendly and helpful. When we ordered pickup one time, we got home to find that it was the wrong order. When I called the store about it, the manager offered to deliver our correct order himself to our home, which he did. I really appreciate Flower Child, and at this rate it will continue to be at the top of our list of restaurants."}
{"text":"Two stars for the blatant misrepresentation. Touting themselves as locally sourced, all natural (a meaningless marketing term anyway), and healthy, this \"new age-y\" eatery has many challenges. My biggest peve... their menu says, \"Our proteins are naturally raised... because happy food makes healthy food.\"

Me to manager: Is the salmon farmed or wild caught?\"

Mr Manager: It's farmed.
Me: How is this natural? How is a constrained fish a happy fish?
MM: The fish are raised in their own environment. They are just restricted.
Me: Seriously? Ok, now you're just spinning words. I'm sure the restricted salmon are not \"happy\" salmon.

A note. The server asked if everything was ok. I showed her where it said \"naturally raised\". Her reply was word for word the same as the manager. Someone was coached.

The noise level was almost an intolerable cacophony. No sound-proofing materials on walls or ceilings.

So now the niceties. A lovely atmosphere visually with lots of pastels and artsie pieces. The patio is large and airy. The selection is varied.

I would recomend a visit to make your own decision."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My new favorite restaurant. Great Vegan choices, and reasonable prices. Staff was friendly and even though it was very busy with a line out the door, they worked hard to get everyone ordered and seated in a timely fashion. Very clean."}
{"text":"First of all the decor is adorable. Very well put together.  We went around 4:00 so we only had to wait in line for a few minutes. The menu is a good size...lots of choices for gluten free which I appreciate!
I had a quinoa salad with chicken, but asked for no quinoa... I know it sounds odd, but it listed a bunch of veggies, so I hoped they would fill up the bowl.  Um... Nope.  It was very very small, BUT it was delicious!  
My husband had the kale salad with salmon... Wow! So good!! He had a nice size portion and the salmon was moist and everything was fresh.  Very very good! 
That all being said... It was way over priced. Cost us $30.00 and we didn't have drinks. I do not understand all of these salad places charging so much...lettuce is cheap! Well, they're making money, so that explains that.  
Although the food we did have was good, I doubt we will come back.  We left hungry and had to go get something more to eat, so it defeats the purpose of eating healthy.  Besides costing me even more money because I had to buy more food.
Bummer."}
{"text":"Very good & healthy!  Great atmosphere too!  Casual but nice.  Children will love the kids plate!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I love this place. This is my go to place whenever I want something healthy- but still tasty & fast. Their ambience of the restaurant is very hipster. Their decor is really well coordinated. 

Their service is always great. Whenever there is a mistake made with my order they are always quick to correct it. 

I'm a creature of habit so I always order the mix n match plate- tofu, sautéed spinach, and spicy eggplant. One of these days I will try something else lol. Oh and their gluten free desserts are heaven !"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Fox concept restaurants...I went in without high expectations and I left pleasantly surprised. I ordered three sides: spicy eggplant, cauliflower, and mac n cheese. All three were very flavorful and fresh. I would go back just for the mac n cheese. The price point is good too at 9 dollars for a healthy and filling lunch."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the vegan Thai Dye wrap from Flower Child and was in awe! The flax/chia wrap was super soft and yummy and the spicy tofu inside added a nice flavour to the meal! Just the right sized portion and kept me full with all the good veggies inside. The restaurant itself was super clean and had a trendy vibe. Also had lots of delicious vegan options, clearly marked on the menu! Wish they had these in Canada so I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 or 5 stars for the food - if it was priced appropriately. Unfortunately, it's a little on the steep side.

I ordered the sesame beef bowl with no rice (4 hour body nonsense), a glass of red wine, and a side of the simple hummus. My boyfriend ordered the same bowl, a side of broccoli, and a small black tea. Our total without tip was $57.00. 

The part that bothers me isn't really the price. I have more expensive meals than this all the time. The issue is that these are sit-down restaurant prices for a \"fast-food\" experience. You order your food at the counter, get a number, and from that point on the only human interaction you have with an employee is someone dropping off the food and taking your number away. I get literally twice the food with the same customer experience for half the price at Chop Shop, so I just really don't get it.

I will say the food was very tasty once we got it. I finished literally every last bite on my plate before leaving, so I did leave satisfied. So just to recap, my 3 star rating is summed by the following:

Service (the little they had) - 5 stars
Quality of food - 4 stars
Prices for what you get - 1 star

Average star rating - 3.33

So there you have it folks! The method to my madness. This place, as Yelp suggests in the star ratings, is not great, not terrible, just okay. A solid \"good.\""}
{"text":"I loved my experience today at flower child! I brought a date here and was super impressed with their number of vegan options. The restaurant was cute, tidy, and I thought the fresh flower on each table was a great touch. I ordered 3 sides and my date ordered a bowl that the cashier recommended. The staff was very friendly and prompt! We both loved our food and well definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Flower Child and Flower Child's throughout the Valley frequently. I had an unsettling experience yesterday when I called in my lunch order and took it to a table inside to eat my lunch. As I was at my table waiting for my colleague to get back with waters, a worker at Flower Child told me I would have to leave or sit outside (in 115 degree weather) because they like to keep the inside tables for people that order at Flower Child. As a frequent paying customer I was taken back by this experience."}
{"text":"We're always in the boca park neighborhood and were so excited so try \"Flower Child\" the place looks welcoming and fresh! I came at 6pm hoping I wouldn't catch the dinner rush, there was no line and ordering was simple. I opted for the mix and match with grass fed steak, corn quinoa and a side of tofu. They have a little area with their own house made drinks and I was interested in trying them. I went over to the drink area but none of the flavors sounded appetizing but I did try the watermelon mango lemonade. The drink was okay but not a wow factor. The food came pretty fast but one at a time, I feel bad waiting for the other persons food. The avocado toast came and the presentation was off, it also needed a little more flavor. When my dish arrived I was SHOCKED at the portion, I had seen pictures online and it was way smaller than I even imagined. I could eat my steak in one bite! The corn quinoa was flavorful and paired well with the steak. As for the tofu, it had a weird texture and did not have any flavor, which is upsetting because I love tofu anything! I would not recommend coming here if you are looking to be full, its more of a snack or lunch time meal."}
{"text":"What a crap hole.  Everybody that was in the restaurant was a smelly hippy.  You know, the un-bathed, Trader Joes type of patrons.  As for the food, OMG, it was all grain/kale garbage.  The only choice for drinks are Tea, Lemonade or water.  Can't even pick a soda for a drink.  When in line to order, I looked at the food the hippies were getting and I though out loud \"I wouldn't feed this 5h1t to my dog\".  
If you're a hippy or enjoy eating like a rabbit, enjoy yourself. Otherwise, I'd stay away."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place at least a hundred times now. That is a testament to how delicious the food taste.  The salad dressings are phenomenal, the salads are pure deliciousness and the ingredients are fresh.  My favorite items are the avocado wrap, strawberry fields and Kale salad with salmon.  If you enjoy a sweet flavor salad go with the strawberry fields. If you enjoy a savory taste try the Kale salad."}
{"text":"Who says you can't have healthy fast food? Luckily if you have a Flower Child nearby you can! This location is big, bright and inviting. Great salads and bowls topped with the protein of your choice... try the salmon, it's excellent! Have a wrap if you're craving a sandwich. Grab a lemonade or an iced tea and enjoy your lunch or dinner. Flower Child is a great addition to the food options at Camelback and Central. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They always exceed my expectations with the level of quality they put into their food, service and atmosphere! Every dish I try is always better than the last, certainly my favorite Fox concept. If you want something fresh and fast that doesn't compromise quality, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of finding a place like this, everything fresh, everything delicious. I wish I owned this place, the doors open at 11 and it's already full of patrons! I'm eating something called a Vietnamese crunch salad and it has ingredients like fresh mint, basil, peanuts, cilantro, lots of deliciousness."}
{"text":"The ULTIMATE cure for a rainy day!
I love everything about Flower Child and try to eat there several times a week. However, yesterday I tried their mushroom & beef barley soup for the first time and immediately ordered 4 bowls of this deliciousness to go. I knew I'd need this wonderful soup to tide me over for the next few days until the sun comes out. 

All I can say is this: if you love mushroom & beef barley soup, then you MUST try the Flower Child version. It's better than Grandma use to make and that's saying a mouthful ... as my little Italian Grandma was THE BEST cook ever!Kudos to Flower Child and their Chef, I am positively addicted to this soup."}
{"text":"Meh.. I don't believe what their selling.. I got an expensive wrap and left hungry. Just because it's the \"new trendy spot\" doesn't mean anything. The food is blah. But hey I get it, charge an arm and leg label it organic and bank!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here. The ambiance, openness of the restaurant and the service are all great; I wouldn't expect anything less than fox. Been here two times now within the week and both times have made me want to come more. The first time I had the raw vegetable salad with chicken and the next, the Mediterranean salad. Both were very very good! I'm on a mission to try them all.

The drink choices are also very good as well. No matter what you choose, they all will quench your thirst. I'll be back very soon !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite vegan/vegetarian spot. i've been to the Scottsdale location as well as this one and the quality is consistent. The service was good. I had the vegan ingredient salad. I got the lemon tahini dressing on the side and also asked for the lemon avocado dressing. Both were delicious. The only thing I would want was extra avocado on the salad. The iced teas are and lemonades also are very good. I want to eat lunch here every day!"}
{"text":"I love this place - for lunch.  Although it might be fun for a casual dinner on the patio.

Had the Hippie Chick wrap and loved it!  Hubby had the Rebel wrap and loved it equally well.  Comes with a nice simple mixed green salad.  Also relaxed with a couple of beers which was a nice treat.  Topped it all off with a Bittersweet Brownie - yum.

Overhead some people complaining about the prices but after we started analyzing it we realized that for about the same price you could be a burger and fries up the street and it wouldn't be nearly as healthful or flavorful, so we decided that the prices were about right on.

Fox - you have a hit here in my book.  Just yesterday we tried another Fox restaurant and were sorely disappointed.  Don't just all of their restaurants the same - because they're not.

I've been craving salmon so we'll probably be back soon."}
{"text":"New favorite place! Such a great environment to begin with. Fresh ambiance and trendy decorations. Many healthy options on the menu and a few fresh juices as well as fresh tea and lemonade. Hip music plays and they have a great patio. I swear everyone in the restaurant looks heathy and happy! I tried the quinoa salad and decided not to add a protein. It was delicious and very filling even without meat. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian or vegan then this place is a great spot to try. They are very veggie friendly and even have gluten free baked goods! Love the teas and lemonades and the food is absolutely delish!!"}
{"text":"I guess when you eat in Scottsdale for the most part you have to expect your going to pay extra for your meal. I just want a portion size to fit the bill. I had the Brussels & Squash with a piece of Salmon the size of the palm of my hand. I don't mind paying extra for the protein. Just make sure   a $15 salad fills me up which it did not. It was tasty. I might down the road try some other dish minus the fish."}
{"text":"Im a big fan of Fox...this restaurant is as beautifully done as all others... 

I arrived early at around 11:30 for lunch - before the place got really packed at approx. 12pm.

Tried the coconut chicken entree - the chicken was a bit undercooked :( but I can see how it can be a winning dish with the chicken properly cooked! 

The avocado hummus is a knockout!!  6/5 

Two other friends had salads - they were content - but not sure they felt they were 5/5

I can't see why I would rather eat here, than at a true foods were there is full service, same or similiar price and/or feel...

No coffee served yet!"}
{"text":"So I tried it for a 2nd time and truth be told, not impressed. 1st Time has the \"Thai Dye\" good flavors but very skimpy wrap. Today, Vegan Poke Bowl and Mother Earth, sad to say, for $9, very skimpy and pretty flavorless. Well I tried, and maybe there is something on the menu that might be better, I just don't know if it's worth it to try. Was really happy I was going to be able to have a gluten free place, on to the next place to try!"}
{"text":"Went to the flower child on Saturday evening around 730pm. The place was busy but the service is really quick. They have kombucha tea on tap ($5) which I had to get. To be honest their grilled asparagus alone made me post this review and give hem 5 stars."}
{"text":"A lovely fun and healthy spot to eat at! Great vibes! As you walk in the  main entrance there is an area to drop off your yoga matts for fellow yogis, which is also next to the crayon bucket and hippie car coloring paper for kids. Ordering style is like an upscale fast food restaurant where you order at the counter, grab a number and find a table. 

If you order a drink they have various teas and lemonade fountains to which you can mix and match! I got a mix of the pineapple lemonade and mango tea..
Food wise I grazed on the Mother Earth for that earthy meal made of sweet potatoes, quinoa, avocado, cucumber, broccoli, pesto sauce, portobello mushrooms and a vinegarette! I was grounded to a wholesome complete meal! This dish is the same as their sister restaurant,  True Foods with their dish called Ancient Grains - which is the ingredient listed for Mother Earth. The apple didn't fall far from the tree! The only comment on the ancient grains in Mother Earth was the grains were a slightly undercooked and hard. Everything else was superb. 

Anyway and either way, the place is to be at and the food  is  organically made. Can't wait to eat here again!! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant surprised me a lot.  I tend to, as most, believe that natural and \"healthy\" foods are not going to have much flavor or be all that interesting. That couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Flower Child!  

It's a bit confusing when you enter and depending on which door you go in, you might be on the wrong end of the line you have to wait in line to order.  You have to read the menu closely because entrees are priced without \"proteins\" which you can add for $5 or so. 2 adults and 2 kids was about $75 which is kind of pricey for a restaurant that does not have table service.  The Yellow Curry is amazing as well as the selection of more natural ice teas and lemonade. 

Very busy during weekday lunch so you may have to wait a few min between placing your order and sitting at a table. 

Will be back with family as they do have nice meals for kids too!"}
{"text":"Some say that Flower Child is too expensive for food that \"you can just make at home.\" I am here to set the record straight. That is so false, unless you can whip up the most delectable corn quinoa and heartiest chicken curry bowl in town. In which case, why are you even on Yelp? Open your own restaurant. 

So many of my meals have come from Flower Child, and I have honestly never been disappointed. It's healthy, fulfilling, and delicious. Also, their lemonade and brownies are insanely good. The gluten free options--impeccable. Where I come from, which is literally the ocean, they don't have salmon this good. Flower Child is an amazing restaurant, and I highly recommend it. 

Tl; dr: I don't condone the hippie movement, but I love Flower Child."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.   I ordered the Rebel a grass-fed steak sandwich wrap. It came with a spring mix salad dressed with a light vinaigrette.   Totally awesome. The charred onions and cheese were a perfect pairing with the thinly sliced beef.  I loved the farmhouse feel of the restaurant. Their flavored teas are to die for!!! Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Outside of having a bad written menu. Fresh local sourced vegetables, vegan dishes and good selection. What I like about the place most is it's really clean and the manager knows what he's doing! Good service even when busy!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Love this place!! Came in for lunch and ordered the madre curry (I think that's what it was called) with shaved chicken and a rose lemonade. 
It was the best meal ever!! The coconut curry was phenomenal...I seriously wasn't that hungry and practically licked the plate clean 
Oh and for all those \"insta\" hardcores, the place is super instagramable"}
{"text":"Fantastic food service & manager.  
George B. The manager is an asset to Fox Restaurant Group.  I'd hire him myself if I could afford him!   

FYI: Get sweet & lo or equal for ice tea sweeteners- don't force your customers to only your choice of sweeteners with 5-8 ice tea varieties"}
{"text":"So good. Eaten here half a dozen times. Each time is a good experience did the gluten free Mac and cheese and Mediterranean salad today. Very tasty and nice to finish the meal and not feel overly full."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a hike up camelback mountain, as it is located about 3min from the park.  We had the Mediterranean salads with chicken and a side of avocado hummus . It was not only delicious but healthy! The produce is organic and the meat naturally raised. I love places that are health conscious while being creative in taste. I will definitely be back and I look forward to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The flavors of the dishes are excellent but just like at other Fox RC places, the portions are very small for the money you pay.   Last night I ordered a Mediterranean chicken salad for $13.    The dressing was out of world good but the salad was very small and for the $5 chicken add-on I paid, I think I got only 5 slices of chicken.   My beer was served in a can, which I don't mind, but it wasn't cold.  Unfortunately I left hungry.  However, the staff is very friendly and they keep a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the environment here! And i love how they accommodate vegans!!! But i ordered the unexpected...i thought i ordered 2 medium sized burritos, but instead i got to large ones! I couldn't finish! But sadly I didn't like Tofu. Just not what i liked. I like to buy it from the store a cook it myself so i just just what i want. But EVERYTHING else was exquisite! 5 star!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  We are eating clean (dairy, gluten, and refined sugar free) and this place has so many great tasting options.  Fast services, clean and fun environment, healthy food, and lots of options.  They even saved us one day with family style chicken when we attempted to grill at home and the food was a little overcooked (BBQ lit on fire!).  Friendly staff and very inviting.  It's become our regular spot."}
{"text":"Great whole food dishes.
If you want a healthy meal this is the place.
The jalapeño's were plentiful they are the typical pickled variety (the only disappointment).
The mushrooms and asparagus were fantastic."}
{"text":"Best place for me to eat since I love Organic food plus am on gluten free diet!! The food is AWESOME!! Wish there is one in California near San Francisco!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! So cute and great service :) food was awesome . I love that they are vegan friendly"}
{"text":"Overrated and PRICEY. I am a meat lover but I love vegetarian and/or vegan options when available. There was enough to choose from on the menu to please most tastes I would think, however both dishes I tried ( mine and my friends) were underwhelming."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place but my first experience wasn't great. I has the quinoa salad (yum) with a side of kale slaw (too much vinegar). It was so loud I could hardly hear my lunch companion but what annoyed me the most was being charged $4 for a drink. Yes, it's a large cup but c'mon.... $4 for iced tea? I will go again if a group is going and I want to be with them but probably won't be the one to suggest it. If I go, I'll swing by AJ's and get a tea first."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!  PLEASE open one of these in Tucson!!!

I have never had a bad meal here and I try something new every time I am here.  My husband and I taste each other's meals and every single dish is absolutely divine.

It is LOUD inside and that would be my only complaint as it is hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was there EVERYDAY, literally for 2 weeks straight food was great. I went in recently and ordered my usual and it was such a disappointment. It tasted like crap and it looked rushed. when I complained the employee told me sorry the trainers left that's probably when you enjoyed your food. I told them they can keep my money they probably needed it more than I do and left pissed!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll eat here frequently only because of the gluten free, vegan options. However, It is VERY INCONSISTENT. Sometimes the food at lunch will be really good and other times just so-so. 

I also loved the Wild Mushroom Pho - but they got rid of it... seasonally I guess... why would you get rid of a soup in the winter just as it's getting cold? 

Regardless, I'll be back because It is conveniently located for business and has many more GFV options than other restaurants and the menu is pretty diverse so everyone can find something they like for a quick, casual lunch."}
{"text":"The food is good. The line is long. The price is as long as the line. But you are paying for the organic and healthy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as I was wanting something healthy and saw great reviews on yelp. The food was amazing!! I got the Mother Nature bowl with chicken and a side of the Brussels sprouts. Everything was fantastic! Please open a location in Orlando, Fl.!!!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and the service.  I especially love that vegan options are specified on the menu, so it's easy to dine there with my meat-eating friends. 

The food is good, my favorite is the veg out wrap and the red chili glazed sweet potato (I love sweet and savory foods).

I'll be back to try the complete menu and ill update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came here for a late lunch after we arrived for our sisters' weekend. Loved the decor, it was bright and cheery. The menu had great variety. I had a tasty local beer from Four Peaks and the refreshing Chopped Vegetable salad. Loved the ginger miso dressing! Wish we had some place like this near me!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant I have been waiting for.  Truly healthy food that actually tastes GREAT in a hip, current atmosphere.  Honestly, I love everything about this place- I love that you can order a mix or sides and have the option of changing up proteins.  The flavors are great.  The setting is light and bright.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I am still kinda iffy on the ordering process.  I was there the other day and had to stand in line (out the door) and honestly, when its 110 degrees outside, that kinda sucks.  Other than that, I give it two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Delicious menu with lots of options (I had the summer strawberry salad with chicken and mulberries, and delicious chia seed vinaigrette and my friend and I shared the avocado hummus with veggies and pita... yummo!!!! Oh and the ice tea and lemonade options were awesome as well), loved the open kitchen concept, was delighted by the adorable furniture that makes you feel like you're sitting on your bestie's patio while you're dining, and the super friendly staff was so helpful. I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in town! Everything on the menu is fresh and delicious. The Mother Earth bowl is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The price however, my sister and I had bowels with a protein and spent about $40.00 on lunch."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Flower Child. I was willing to give it another try because my sister is obsessed with it!  Today my daughter and I ordered the Pho Soup and the Sliced Beef Bowl. The Beef bowl was decent, but nothing spectacular taste wise. My daughter had the Pho.  This had to be the worst bowl of pho I have ever sampled!  Tasteless and bland.  The upside is the manager was a sweetheart who promptly refunded our money and asked what they could do to improve the dish.  This is the reason why I will continue to frequent Fox Concept restaurants. The employees are spectacular and very well trained, she did not look a day over 21, but handled the situation like a true pro!!!  Also the girls at the counter are dolls!  I suggested that they send the chef down to a little hole in the wall called Pho AV to steal the secret to the broth that  makes Pho the special soup that it is.  With a little fine tuning taste wise Flower Child will flourish!!  The best thing about it is the homemade lemonades that are superb and made with real sugar."}
{"text":"This place awesome. Reasonably priced, well sourced food. The portions only look small, but are quite filling. The plates, like Japanese eggplant, curried cauliflower, spinach, and spice green beans are delicious (but definitely small...but delicious). Their wraps are killer, The Rebel especially. The variety of grains they cook with is also very refreshing, I think just the forbidden grain dish has three or four. Great atmosphere, great service. Clearly there's some pride put into everything done here."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended this place to me and it is super cute-the outside seating has flower beds and spray mist but of course it was too hot to sit out there at noon. My boyfriend created his own plate with eggplant, brown rice, and mashed potatoes. Man the eggplant was the best I've ever had! And even the mashed potatoes without gravy was so good. Portions were small and the price was a bit on the pricey side but still good! I had the Thai dye wrap which was delicious as well. You order and they give you a number and bring your food to you. I'd come back if I'm ever back in Arizona :)"}
{"text":"Place is adorable. Clean, tidy, staff is pleasant and work flow is organized. Overall fast service. Food tasted great, portions were kind of small and definitely on the pricey side. I had a salad with steak and my bf had a bowl with steak. We paid $35 for healthy \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"First time here in Arcadia flower child.   The freshness , quality ingredients, and so many veg options made this a great lunch pick . so delicious ! We had The Mediterranean tabbouleh salad , Brussels sprout and butternut squash salad , pick 2 Indian spiced cauliflower and quinoa & corn sides warm so savory .  I highly recommend this restaurant. My Only feedback would be a better filtration system for the cold brew. Quality H2O is the second most important ingredient in that recipe ."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. My wife recommended this place. I rolled my eyes wondering what the hell I was going to eat because it was healthy! First thing I noticed was how clean everything was. All of the employees were excellent at cleaning up there stations after cutting vegetables, prepping meats and rinsing lettuce. The best part about this place was the food. Everything was fresh and delicious. I definitely would go back anytime."}
{"text":"My mom noticed this place went in so she treated my brother and I to dinner. I am a pretty big eater and I was disappointed when I got my wrap. The portions are pretty small. On top of this, I had a hard time picking something off the menu. Just, the food is different. The service is pretty good....not the greatest."}
{"text":"Another Sam Fox restaurant with the same results. A+ ambiance, great service, and a reasonable price point. But then there is the food. Don't get me wrong, everything I tasted was good, but nothing was done great. All the plates that I tried were neither exceptional or memorable. I left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. 

Maybe I set a high standard due to how great all the other aspects of the restaurant are. But in order to keep me coming back, the food must be different, have exceptional flavor, or just be memorable in some positive way. 

Overall not bad, just not too exciting either."}
{"text":"Was a big Flower Child fan until they began building numerous locations. That's when the menu seemed to suffer. Items like roasted veggies were replaced with cheaper options like mashed potatoes. Miss the great sides. Food is and always has been pricey and portions are on the smaller side. Fun atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place to eat. Love the interior! The menu was pretty impressive! Lots of variety and everything sounded pretty tasty. I had the Flying Avocado wrap and honestly it was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I did like that it came with a small spring mix salad! My party also had the hummus plate and the children's mac n cheese. Both were delicious! Hummus was very flavorful! The mac n cheese was light and cheesy. They had a drink station with a nice assortment of lemonades and teas. Would try again, but maybe one of their bowls instead."}
{"text":"New gem in Vegas, not on The Strip!! Flower Child is a unique blend of a healthy dining alternative menu, modern- urban oasis set in a most relaxing indoor- outdoor venue! Waitstaff is most professional and educated in the quality and prep concerning this most healthy dining experience. The wraps are delicious! Our salads and bowls are  huge and we were able to add chicken or salmon to fit our desires! The children's menu is a delight. Ample seating and parking also add to the experience. Thank you to the Fox Group and to Nicholas Castrovillari, GM, for bringing this exciting new dining venue to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Was in town for spring training and spent our trip with a local. She took us to this flower child joint and we couldn't have been more pleased. 

The grass fed beef protein bowl was excellent and would highly recommend the gluten free Mac and cheese as a side. 

Also the turmeric seasoned cauliflower was delicious. 

Tried multiple desserts as well. Would recommend the choc chip cookie. 

A protein bowl with 3 sides will run you about 15 bucks. Totally worth it. Will visit again. 

Staff was really kind and courteous. Dude at the counter gave me a compliment on my beard and one of the girls took a picture of us for us! 

Awesome
Place."}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice, extremely accommodating, and the food is delicious. I go here with my step daughter who is 4, and she eats tons of veggies! Everything is really flavorful, and they have quite a few options for vegans. The lemonade and teas are yummy, the atmosphere is great. It says two moneys, but it's reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The wait is not that long if you don't come at lunch time. If you do plan on standing in line. The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Omg this place is my favorite!!!! Every single item on the menu is delicious. Love the concept of healthy, clean, LOCAL farm to table eating...I almost always do the \"build your own\" thing with chicken and alternate sides depending on my mood/hunger level, but I have to say the gluten free Mac and Cheese is my favorite thing on the menu!!!! I could eat it all day every day."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the FRC collection, and a great addition to the Arcadia 'hood. My daughter has celiac, so we are always looking for good options. This place has a vast majority of the menu as Gluten Free, which is awesome. I had the salmon, broccoli with Mac and cheese and it was exceptional. Great job FRC!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Not cheap, but worth it. I'll be back. Lots of healthy, real, delicious food. They were super busy when we came in, for our first time, and we were shocked at how quickly they brought us our food.

They sell Juby True juices & coffee too. Really good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so great i visited it today for the first time and i loved it i will definitely be going there more often! It has such a clean and relaxing attire. Food was awesomeeee so fresh and enjoyable. Service was great and such a friendly staff crew. I encourage you to go and try it, leave room for desert as their vegan pudding is a must try!"}
{"text":"To be fair, vegan/health food stuff is not usually my cup of tea, so keep that in mind as you read my review.

I've gone to restaurants that serve the same type of fare, and absolutely loved it. I was expecting something similar, based on the glowing recommendations I got from a trusted foodie friend. But to me, it was just bad. I could barely eat my entree (what there was of it).

I don't mind paying for something really good, but when I ordered the grilled tofu on my Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl, what arrived was about two bites' worth. When I hear the words \"Thai,\" \"cashew,\" and \"bowl,\" what I'm expecting is something with a slightly sweet and savory flavor, with cashews. I could barely locate the cashews, and there was no hint of the sweet-spicy combo that is, for me, what defines Thai food. What I got was a bowl of quinoa. To me, that's more of a filler or garnish, not a meal. And too much of it kind of grosses me out, as I discovered during this meal. To like this dish, you have to enjoy the feel of a bunch of flavorless fish eggs in your mouth. (I don't, which is why I won't even try caviar.)

I wrote this review not to bash the place, but to warn away people like me who are somewhat adventurous and may find themselves talked into trying this place by well-meaning friends, but who just won't like it, and will wish they'd spent about half the amount on some good Panang curry or Thai basil with tofu instead.

The place seems extremely clean, and was pretty. The people were very nice and helpful. The pomegranate lemonade was good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a quick and healthy meal. I seriously love this place. 

My go-to dish is the Forbidden Rice bowl (with added salmon) and my fiance loves the Flying Avocado wrap. If you are checking out the sides, definitely consider the cauliflower! It's my favorite. We also like the mac-n-cheese and the mashed potatoes. Everything always tastes so fresh and delicious. 

My coworkers enjoy this place as well and we frequent this place at least 5-8 times a month. One of my coworkers is vegetarian and loves the variety here. This is one of those places where you walk up and order at the counter, receive a number and they will bring your food to the table."}
{"text":"Great food, Slow service

Their food is fresh, flavorful, and healthy. Definitely one of the best health-food restaurants I've been to. 

Unfortunately, their service is lacking quite a bit. I ordered To-Go (before the rush) and sat for over 30 minutes waiting for my food. By the time I got it, it was already cold. Pretty disappointing given that one of the reasons I eat fresh is so I don't have to deal with soggy, old food."}
{"text":"Pricey and fairly small portions (I saw a woman ask for a to-go box and I couldn't believe it!)...but well worth it! The guys and girls working in the kitchen are working super hard from the looks of it. Great and friendly staff. One of the waitresses posed for a pictures with my 2 year old daughter because they had the same hair color and style, eyes, shirt, and pants. It was adorable and she was such a good aport about it.
The bowls are super tasty and so is the daily soup. 
My last two words; The Rebel!"}
{"text":"Okay let's talk about this place! The decorations are so simple and cuuuute! I ordered the Mother Earth bowl and it came with chicken, pesto, avocado. sweet potato, quinoa, greens, onions, and cucumber. In my opinion, I think there was too much quinoa. There should be a little less of that and maybe more vegetables or even pesto, since there was barely any of that. I don't know if that's a personal preference or an actual portion issue lol the chicken was tender and juicy. The pesto was savory. The cucumber added a much needed freshness and cooking sensation to the plate. The sweet potato les were, to my surprise, \"spicier\" than I expected! It was a nice surprise. Not spicy to me but it had a nice little flavor kick. For personal preference, I would say no onion. They have fresh lemonades and teas. They're delicious. I think I would return here! It's cute and tastes good!"}
{"text":"We flew in from California and looked for a good vegan/vegetarian restaurant.  Tried it, loved it, and went back three more days to enjoy it again!  Also brought another couple, and they are now repeating their experience.  Great food, wonderful people, and nice casual environment."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this place. Over the past 3 months or so it's gone downhill. They have fabulous house crafted teas and lemonades. While the food is delicious, it's being served lukewarm, like under 120 degrees lately. Someone could easily get sick when food is left between 41-140 degrees.

I have notified staff and the assistant general manager of this multiple times now without seeing any improvements. On several occasions, I even requested that cashier tell the kitchen to make sure my food is hot. And yet, my requests were ignored despite even tipping them. Despite my complaints to staff and management, they have never once even offered to comp my food. 

I get the impression the staff does not care. Flower Child is a high-priced fast food chain. Healthy food begins with food safety! There's no point to eating healthy food that you're likely to get sick from. There are plenty of other healthy, safer, and even less expensive options in this area."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times, but Flower Child is one of those places I've recommended to nearly everyone I know! The fresh, healthy menu is perfect for hot summer days and anyone who cares about what they put into their bodies. They have tons of options for customizing orders or compatibility with specialized diets, with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free logos on the menu, making it easy for everyone. Location is super cute and staff are helpful and friendly- when the line is out the door (their lunch rush is no joke!), they expedite by reserving tables in advance. 

So far, I've liked everything I've tried- the Strawberry Fields salad is fresh and I love the addition of mulberries, the Thai Dye wrap with spicy tofu is perfect for Meatless Mondays, Skinny Cobb tastes better than the full-guilt versions elsewhere, and the avocado hummus is a must-get every time. Check out the bowls and plates if you have a heartier appetite. 

I'm usually a water-only kind of gal, but this is one place I'll splurge for a drink- they have a variety of house-made concoctions with fresh fruit, no sugar, decaf, etc and they've all tasted great so far!"}
{"text":"Great addition in Summerlin. This is the 9th location on a Phoenix based restaurant. The food was great- health choices, taste good, only thing is a little bit expensive for what you get.  Service is great.  Clean and sleek place.  Tried the pick 3 with grass fed steak- got the sautéed spinach, sautéed eggplant-yum-, and green beans.  No soda but have local beers. Definitely coming back to try other meals in the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food, unique menu, everything made fresh in house, healthy, great portions and not too heavy. I give it 4 stars due to consistency issues. I have come here numerous times and hot foods are sometimes luke warm or cold. This is a half service restaurant...you order at counter and they bring food too you. I wish staff would check on all guests to ensure everything is alright."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's my go to lunch spot these days. Lots of variety, healthy, flavorful meals, and I don't feel bad about eating out. I usually get the mix and match sides with added protein. I think I've had almost every side and they were all amazing! The sweet potatoes with bok choy is probably my favorite. Even when the line is fairly long at the Camelback location, it moves relatively quickly."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about flower child and wanted to go and on the way home one day I saw a sign that said to come get take out. I decided to try because I wasn't really in the mood to cook. 

The restaurant is beautiful. Great outdoor and indoor space. Kombucha on tap! 

The have a separate window for takeout orders. They have a 2 different family meals, a larger one and a smaller one. The regular family $39 for chicken and it comes with 3 large sides of your choosing. The larger meal comes with 4 large sides. 

The chicken was chicken breast cut into slices. The three sides I got were the sweet potatoes (4 stars), the Indian cauliflower (4 stars), and the corn quinoa( 5 stars). The quinoa corn creamy concoction is like crack.  

I love when places have family meals like this!"}
{"text":"Summerlin needed a new healthy lunch spot.  Fun atmosphere,  attractive crowd, good salads and a lot of options.  My new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"In all my travels across the globe, dining at thousands of restaurants, I've never seen a better or healthier menu. Top to bottom, perfect combination of great tasting, ultra healthy entrees, combinations, whole grain choices, and extremely well presented meals.

We dined here on Memorial Day, and I consider it a true gift to have found the restaurant. We had two different salads, and watched as other customers meals were served?.

Great customer service. I've been waiting for a restaurant like this for decades. Decades  Yes, decades...... So happy"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Phoenix! The vegan food is just incredible. The interior is beautiful and the outdoor seating is pleasant. Yummy food for all tastebuds!!"}
{"text":"Second time this week because that mac and cheese is to die for. I could eat here daily. They have a great selection for all dietary styles and offer full flavors with bold combinations. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week!  Haven't had a bad meal yet and it's so nice to be recognized by the employees!  Great customer service!  Love the iced tea, the brownie is amazing too!  Just had Mother Earth for the first time and loved it!  I also recommend the pick three(Mac and cheese, Indian spiced cauliflower are my favorites) and the Summer Vegan salad!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl, no chicken, and what I received was a bowl with chicken and with wilted spinach/lettuce. The food still tasted good but I guess for future reference, check the lettuce before you leave."}
{"text":"YUM.  I got the vegan salad (I'm not vegan) and it was delicious.  It had a little bit of everything and I really dug the lemon tahini dressing.  I saw another reviewer mention the lemonade and they were spot on - get the lemonade!  It's a bit expensive but \"snooty food\" usually is.  Worth it and if I'm in the area again, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the Mother Earth bowl with grass fed steak. ancient grains, sweet potato, portobello mushroom, avocado, cucumber, broccoli pesto, charred onions, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, hemp seed. It was amazing. Large portion. I was so full afterwards. My son got chicken, mashed potato and Mac and cheese and my fiancé got the bird it the word. I tried his and it was also really good."}
{"text":"In and out in 15 minutes during lunch rush thanks to the separate entrance for take out/to go orders.  Food was fresh and really good.   The staff are helpful and friendly.  A little pricey; but expected when you're buying organic. I think I found my new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"I really like Flower Child and I eat there quite often. Staff is very courteous, nice atmosphere and everything I've ever eaten has been either good or great.  However, they took my favorite item off the menu.  Apparently they have a rotating bowl on the menu. The last rotation was the Burrito Bowl. IT WAS THE BEST.   The latest rotation is a curry bowl. Not as good. Flower Child is not getting five stars until they BRING BACK THE BURRITO BOWL.  BRING BACK THE BURRITO BOWL."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's simple, almost fast, delicious, and nutritious food. All the wraps are excellent. I really love their smashed potatoes and simple broccoli. They have tons of fun and exotic teas & lemonades to choose from. And DO NOT skip their olive oil cake muffins. I literally can't stop thinking about them. The ambiance is cute and comfortable to boot."}
{"text":"I'll  start off by saying that they have great employees and are very well staffed. Now that we got the positive stuff out of the way... Fox or whoever owns you guys should be ashamed. I know you want to appeal to the trendy man-bun types, but use some common sense. These dishes dont make sense. Raisins in curry? Hire someone to redo your menu. Also they only had 2 beers on tap and 4 empty keg slots. You have a chain of restaurants so you should know better. Get your shit in order."}
{"text":"Love this place. Simple ,healthy food that is lightly seasoned and always tasty. I usually get the plate/ bowl where you mix and match your favorite sides with a protein if you wish- steak, chicken, salmon or tofu. Sides are various veggies, fruit, brown rice, gluten free mac-n-cheese, etc. Salads, wraps, and hummus are also available. The avocado hummus is amazing- it's a must try. Nice choice of lemonades and iced teas (no sodas). Good to-go meals also. I could eat here every day..."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. It had a big open room with plenty of seats available inside and out, everything had a very cutesy natural vibe with chalk signs and mason jar glasses, and their were plenty of delicious options on the menu. Too many to mention but it is worth nothing that it is vegan and vegetarian friendly! And if all of that isn't enough that had a wonderful selection of teas and lemonades which I highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at Flower Child. It's decorated cute and it has a comfortable, relaxed vibe. The line always moves quickly and the food is good. I've had a few different salads and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I love the salmon as an add on to my salad. They do not have any diet soda, which I do not like. I know it's supposed to be a healthy/natural food place but I want a Diet Coke with my lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go into Flower Child on opening day because all I would hear was great things about it. I went into Flower Child on opening day and it was so cute inside and the staff was very nice and helpful. Once I was done ordering my food I went over to get some utensils and I had to pull four different forks out to get a clean one. I myself work in a restaurant industry and know that can happen but still was disappointed for it being opening day. After I sat down, my boyfriend and I got our food and noticed there was a long strand of hair in my food. I was appalled so I gathered and employee and they were kind enough to get me a new dish and gave me my money back. My boyfriend ate his turkey avocado wrap but after he was finished and I looked through the salad an eyelash appeared out of the salad. I was completely disgusted. My boyfriend proceeded to get another employee who got the manager and she took the plate away and gave us a refund on the other dish. 

The thing that I wasn't happy about is the manager tried to imply it was mine or my boyfriends eyelash. Him and I did not rub our eyes at all at dinner and when I looked over into the kitchen I was able to see a man who was making salads that kept rubbing his eyes....I was very nice to the employees and manager and just thought bringing the low hygiene problem at Wild flower to their attention and not making a scene was with the upmost respect by me. Overall the food was amazing but my experience of poor hygiene ruined it."}
{"text":"I had a trio of sides, avocado with beets, quinoa tabouleh and the corn with quinoa. All were delicious with lots of flavor. Portions are on the small side, but every bite has flavor. The gluten free chocolate cake is very good!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here in the late afternoon/dinnertime a couple times a week for the past 2 weeks since it's so close to home and work. I LOVE ALL THE MEATS. They're grilled perfectly, cut perfectly, and have the best flavor. I just wish they were cheaper! Although the flavors are so good that it makes me forget the price at times, lol. The steak is always grilled perfectly medium. The onions, the corn mac and cheese, the yams, broccoli... SO MUCH YUM! Everything has so much flavor and it's all health-focused meals too! I've only tried their lemon olive oil muffin from their dessert menu, and it's real soft; not overly greasy or anything I thought it would be since it's an olive oil cake. Other than over-paying for extra proteins Flower Child gets an A+."}
{"text":"Is this is eating healthy, I can eat healthy every day. I got the summer vegan salad and it was delicious. Got there a little before 11 and there was already people lined up outside. It got busy fast."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. The ambience was rustic and \"hipster\". I liked all of the healthy options they had. I got the Forbidden Rice with tofu. They also had really nice brewed teas. I give this 4 stars just because it was pricey. For lunch and a large drink it was $19. It was a neat experience. Also, they sell \"Boxed Water is Better\" so that was cool to see."}
{"text":"I went here since the name sounded so cute! I am a hippy at heart! I also found them on the Happy Cow app (a vegetarian and vegan listing of restaurants and stores.) 
I took my boyfriend who is an omnivore and be loved the chicken avocado sandwich. I ordered the vegan Cesar salad with no sunflower seeds (I have an allergy) and koumbucha."}
{"text":"Tony made my day! I got there too early but he still comped my tea and showed me around the location! I'll def be back to see him and test out the location! I'll be telling everyone about my experience also! Thanks, Tony!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this delightfully healthy restaurant. With an inviting, open concept environment Flower Child allows adults and children to eat healthy and truly enjoy the food and beverages that are delivered to their table. There are a couple of things to be aware of. First, eating organic and healthy tends to be a bit more expensive and Flower Child is no exception to this rule. For my daughter and I to eat lunch here, the cost is $25.50 without tax and tip. Also, this is a popular place to eat so be prepared to wait in line. 

When it comes to food, my favorite selections are the whole grain wraps. There are few places that get healthy wraps right, but Flower Child does! I specifically like the Flying Avocado and Bird is the Word. My daughter orders off of the Healthy Kids menu where she gets to choose one protein(grass fed beef, chicken, or tufu) and two sides (broccoli, smashed potato, corn & quinoa, mac & cheese, brown rice or clementines & apples). I love that they don't serve soda. Instead you have the options of delicious teas, lemonades, water or drinks in the refrigerator. My personal favorite is the green tea, unbelievably good!"}
{"text":"Love their food. Healthy with vegan options or grassfed beef / other meats options.

Salads, bowls, and other foods.

Prices are decent, plenty of food quantity.  Nice flavors.  They will gladly take substitutions in dishes (at least what I wanted) but there is such a variety of combinations likely you will like something off the menu.

They are often very crowded at lunch but they have a system down so things qo quickly.  As you are in line, someone will ask how many and find you a table so by the time you have ordered a table is waiting.  Food service is quick.

I would eat there all the time if I was closer."}
{"text":"Ditto many comments already mentioned. Food? Pretty good. I had the roasted mushroom salad. Didn't order a drink because I don't pay $4 for fancy tea. That's me. Food pricing? On the too high side. Parking? Stinks. Crowd? Waited in line, but yes it moved fast. Was I confused about \"how does this work?\" when I walked in? Yes. I asked the procedure, and they happily told me. My friend and I ordered at the same time, but paid on our own tickets. She got her meal about 10 minutes before me. Not cool. Biggest problem? WAY TOO LOUD!! We were at a small table across from each other and couldn't hear our own conversation. Will i go back? Probably not. Love the healthy food concept, but think I'll just do Chop Shop or make my own."}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy food!   Loved the Japanese Eggplant and Indian cauliflower.   The salmon was tasty too, but a little on the small side.  The hummus was very good too!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I was unaware it was the grand opening today. I was in the neighborhood & remembered seeing this place on facebook so thought I would try. First I LOVED the ambiance & enviromentfelt very positive & welcoming. Decor was so sweet! All the staff were friendly and welcoming. It was obvious they put a lot of time and effort into this place. Then the food came and it was delicious! Fresh and full of flavor! I will definitely be visiting again in the near future, this time with the whole family. Great job guys"}
{"text":"Super cute vibe. Tasty food but not too much variety in regards to their menu and a little over priced for the portions. But it's pretty typical of a healthy restaurant. All their different tea options are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I had to stop in on business and was starving. The menu was not my thing but there's a reason the place is always packed. So I decided to order some random items and wow! 

The food is so good. I'll definitely be back to order other items to try. They make being adventurous a must-do. I had the gluten-free Mac & cheese, Red chili glazed sweet potatoes and Indian spiced cauliflower. Delicious! 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. I needed a lot of guidance. As I was cleaning up my table when I was finished, an employee guided me to leave my stuff on the table for them to pick up. They were all very aware of the newbie and eager to help unsolicited. That's hard to find these days. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have had at least 30% of the items on the menu. Really have enjoyed everything. The price is excellent considering the quality of the food. For those that think it is pricey, please remember it costs more for fresh. organic (I realize that it isn't all organic) and made from SCRATCH food. You get what you pay for and here you can know that you are eating clean, healthy food. The fact that they do so many things gluten free (I am not gluten free) for the price that they do them for is truly amazing. Love the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Good food. Not worth $16 for a beef bowl, though. I won't be back; the prices aren't worth it in the slightest."}
{"text":"YUCK. I want to like this place so much. I live nearby, so it is convenient and they offer \"healthy\" food, but good god is it disgusting. I've tried just about everything on the menu, and each time am left choking it down. The only saving graces are their lemonade and their GF macaroni and cheese. Otherwise, expect to pay way too much money for garbage food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were getting hungry while driving around. Usually it's a bit of a challenge because we are healthy gluten free eaters. But we just happened to drive by this place and liked the name. So we pulled over and checked the reviews and liked what we read. We were very happy with the food and atmosphere. Lots of organic and gluten free options. Prices were fine for the quality of food."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews, I went there for lunch. I ordered the chopped vegetable salad. The portion was very small. The vegetables were sliced, not chopped. The dressing was tasteless. It was probably the worst meal I had in Phoenix. Overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing food, this is what u call fresh cut made food . I had a salad and let me tell u that first bite just bursts with flavor . Worth the money and it's very clean . Only suggestion would be having them expand their menu a bit . Parking is convenient."}
{"text":"their food is great. i love the walk up and order thing they got going. it makes for super fast food service. there is also an outdoor patio. their menu is pretty simple which makes for better decision making. the only thing i did not enjoy was their kombucha. they say it is homemade but i found it to be a bit too flat for my taste. there were other drinks that are good but i would advise against their kombucha for sure. they also allow for substitutions which is nice because i dont always like certain veggies with certain meats."}
{"text":"This was my first time to flower child and I didn't know what to expect. I noticed trendy decor as I walked in but I was blown away by the service I received. One host in particular, Izzy, made our experience one to remember. She contained this vibrant personality that just reeled me in. She knew the menu top from bottom when I asked questions about it, considering this was my first time at the establishment  & the service was impeccable. We gathered our seats and gazed at the art work and lights that consumed the building. Our server George treated us with incredible service and kindness. He made sure to ask if we were comfortable and secure with our meal. Izzy, the host from earlier in the night stole a second from the front to ask us how my experience has been so far. She went above and beyond to make sure this dining experience was one to remember. Flower Child has delightful cuisine as much as service. Amazing experience all around !!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! Something my health conscious sister and I can agree on!! 
So exciting- I with there was one in tucson. I had the steak wrap and Kombucha. Aaaaamazing. My only regret was not getting a lemonade. 
It was so delicious that it almost didn't feel like healthy food :) 
Service was better than you would ever expect from a counter order type of place. But on par with Fox standards of course!"}
{"text":"Litterely the smallest portion. The sides are about two bites and my steak was what seemed to be 1/4 of a normal piece"}
{"text":"Love the concept and the food is fantastic! I've only gotten take out from here but the restaurant atmosphere is very nice so it would be a great place to dine in. The menu has a lot of variety so there should be something for everyone.

I love the Winter Sunshine salad with roasted sweet potato, grains, and bright citrus. It tastes great, is satisfying, and feels healthy. The Organic Smashed Potatoes are everything you want mashed potatoes to be (warm, soft, and so comforting) but taken up a notch than what most of us make at home with subtle garlic and rosemary. 

This is a great choice, and especially great for people at Scottsdale Shea hospital (healthy food that beats the hospital cafeteria)."}
{"text":"Kombucha. Salad. Organic wine. 

I love the open feel of these locations, the cute bohemian healthy farm decor and the easy to absorb menu. You basically pick a salad or bowl and add a protein ! Then you can add in desserts as well since they looked scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"I went to flower child for dinner last evening. I thought the food was very good. I ordered a quinoa bowl with sliced beef. Taste was good, portion size was small, I thought it was a little bit expensive for the meal but I'd likely come back"}
{"text":"I am so excited that this amazing restaurant opened so close to my house. I had a really amazing first experience. I came in at about 8:25 (they close at 9) and the place was PACKED. I really think they should  stay open later. Especially on weekends, you aint in Cali anymore ! Vegas peeps like to dine late, especially trendy vegan ones. I had the \"choose three\" plate and chose the Indian spiced Cauliflower, Smashed Potato, and the Spicy eggplant with basil. I am still dreaming about that eggplant, tastes like a Thai dish. Atmosphere is beautiful, especially on the patio. I loved the lemonade as well.  Will be returning frequently."}
{"text":"I just can't anymore.  There's so many good food options in this area.  The food flavors are reasonable.  Nothing is so compelling that it draws me in on its own.  Here's the real problem, value.  It's so bad.  I spend so much and walk out with so little.  This place is drawing on people that want to eat well, not stuff themselves.  I get it.  It's why I tried it and went back.  At this point I've been a few times with different people.  Not once have I ever felt that my money was well spent.  I know I paying for their rent, not their food.  It's ridiculous though.  I get four spears of broccoli florets for $3.5?!  

The reality is, there are just too many options of quality food.  Too many places right in the neighborhood that are working hard for my hard earned money.  This place doesn't care.  Or I'm in the minority and plenty of others don't mind dropping $20 dollars for a little bit of food.

This is probably the worst review I've written.  But it's honest."}
{"text":"Looking for a sandwich with a side of fries?  You'll be disappointed.  This is a healthy options restaurant.  Greens & Grains in a variety of menu choices.  Salads, bowls & wraps.  Whole grain or quinoa blends.  Add protein with chicken, beef or tofu. Figure about $12 per entrée.  It's all fresh.  All healthy.  Five stars if they had a bag of chips."}
{"text":"So this is like the faster, healthier, more casual version of the Henry. I think the food is a little overpriced and the place is a little too seen-and-be-seen-ish, but I keep returning, because the concept works for me. I'm always looking for healthy convenient options and Flower Child fits the bill. I like how organized they are in the ordering process; you walk in and a staff member will grab a table and put a number on it for you while you order. This process prevents you from having to meander around stalking people for a place to sit, it makes for a lot less awkward experience.  

Everything I've tried so far has been quite tasty, the quinoa salad is delicious and filling with crunchy kale and flavorful manchego, I get it with grilled tofu for extra protein. I've also had the \"pick 3\" and I highly recommend the sweet corn and quinoa, it's very rich and creamy you can't tell that it's healthy at all. I also really enjoy the Flying Avocado wrap, the chicken is cooked perfectly and the hummus and avocado go really well with the veggies, also they let me substitute the gouda for manchego without the bat of an eyelash which was really nice.  

My favorite part of Flower Child is the fresh lemonade that comes in seasonal flavors and the delicious fresh brewed Iced Tea. I'm a sucker for a good Arnold Palmer and I love being to make my own and come back for unlimited refills. If  you're looking for a casual healthy dining experience in the Arcadia area I would recommend checking out Flower Child."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great, plain and simple.  The food is portioned well to where you don't feel hungry after and you're not quite full either.  Of course their assortment of desserts can definitely get you there.  The seating arrangement is great, and decorating definitely fits theme.  The only negative is that because it is a hot new place for lunch, you might be standing in line a little bit, but they do a great job of managing that.  Finally, my favorite part of the restaurant was the lemonade.  It's stupid how good it is, but don't worry because their 32 is cup has you covered."}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of spontaneously meeting up with some family while on a business trip to Phoenix. Lucky me that I got turned on to the delicious gem.  If you like real, clean, whole food then check out Flower Child.   The Thai Dye wrap was fresh and healthy with spicy tofu and crunchy veggies on a chia seed wrap.  Another notable is the create your own plate with your choice of veggies, grains and protein.  The avocado hummus was the perfect marriage of guacamole and hummus. To wash it down I had a generous glass of red wine - eight bucks for eight ounces!  The soundtrack was mellow and slightly obscure.  Stop by and sit outside on a warm Autumn night.  Very cool place."}
{"text":"Yikes, stopped here because the girlfriend was hungry. I got the fly avocado wrap and she got the mothers garden with steak. 

The wrap was average, but the food falls out of the bottom which I imagine is why they serve you a bowl. 

But her food was terrible. It tastes like the Pacific Ocean/ rubber cow. The steak was chewy, cold, and tasteless and the rest of the food was drenched in salt. I literally felt like I was in a salt mine.

The worst part, I showed up with a hungry girlfriend and I left with a hungry girlfriend."}
{"text":"WOW-this place needs to have more than one location. LOVE the menu.
Options for everyone.
Veggies, wraps, salads....new things to try.

When we walked in we were greeted by an enthusiastic person, she explained the menu, assigned us a number, which was great because it was VERY busy. My stress was that we would get food and have nowhere to sit...BUT our enthusiastic greeter took care of that for us.

We started with avocado hummus and gluten free pita...DELISH.
We ordered the watermelon tomato salad and also a streak wrap to share. Loved the steak wrap, maybe the watermelon tomato salad a little less.
We also got a trio of veggies to share, all tasty. The Quinoa corn type pudding was good. Loved the tabbouleh. The kale apple slaw was just sweet enough.

The fact that they have so many fresh beverages on tap is nice too.

I would eat here every day.

We had servers stopping by our table every 5 minutes asking if we needed anything-ALL AROUND GREAT.

Seriously, can you open one of these closer to North Scottsdale????!!! PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I have tried and very much enjoy the food and ambience of all locations! Healthy, delicious and adorable decor. The lemonade and Mac and cheese are da bomb! :)"}
{"text":"Healthy, organic and delicious. Love the steak wrap and sweet potato side"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when I tried it in Scottsdale. So excited that it's finally in Vegas. Everything from the minute I walked in to my very last bite of food was great. We were greeted immediately as soon as we entered. The food was fresh & tasty. I loved the vegan cauliflower soup & Thai crunch salad. Avocado toast was yummy. My husband had the turkey Gouda wrap. I love that after our meal we didn't feel
Bloated or heavy! This will def be my go to spot"}
{"text":"In my experience, the food here has typically been good, but overpriced.  My last experience, however, was disappointing.  I was excited to try the forbidden rice bowl, which has no nuts listed in the ingredients. I have a nut allergy.  The minute I took my first bite, I had an allergic reaction that I can only attribute to nuts.  After walking back up with the bowl, a manager was called up and I was asked if I would like something else.  I opted for the rebel wrap, which I've had before.  When it was brought out, the manager did share that they had coached the kitchen staff on cross-contamination and offered to show me the ingredients.  Excellent customer service, however, would have been to either comp the meal or, at minimum, offer to refund the difference in price between the two meals.  None of those happened.  Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"I've now gone three times since my first review. I've had the goddess(?) bowl, the green curry soup, the avocado hummus, and the vegan Caesar. All things I did not originally see on the menu when I first wrote my review. 

Holy smokes I was in love with all of it. The vegan Caesar especially due to the sun-dried olives. 

I'm glad they changed their menu up a bit. Will be going more often!"}
{"text":"Need to get there early as the wait is rather long and out in the in the Phoenix heat.  It is very noisy inside.  The staff are very pleasant.  I ordered the chopped vegetable salad with steak.  There was lot of salad greens but very little vegetables.  The steak was a little tough but if eaten in very small bites this was okay.  The serving size was on the small side."}
{"text":"Flower Child is fresh, healthy, quick and delicious! What more could you want? Their wide variety of healthy sides make the perfect pairing to your protein of choice {Chicken, Steak, Salmon or Tofu}. I ordered the Vegan Caesar Saad + Chicken and a side of the gluten free Mac & Cheese {...it's my guilty pleasure!} and both were to die for. They also have yummy wraps & bowls to choose from! Their fabulous fountain drink bar has a variety of fruity iced teas and homemade lemonades, perfect for a summer day! Go. Here. Now. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Flower Child NEVER disappoints! I've eaten here twice in the last two days. And i'm proud of it because their food is healthy and fresh! I pretty much always get their Vegan salad because the lemon tahini dressing is a dream! They sometimes switch up the ingredients with the seasons but it is always good. 

But last week I tried their Mother Earth bowl and it was SO YUM! I couldn't believe how hearty it was without protein. I was stuffed afterwards. It was packed with sweet potatoes, mushrooms, avocado, grains, arugula, vegan pesto, and i'm probably missing something. I also tried their avocado hummus with veggies and flatbread and it was a dream. I love their iced tea/lemonade bar as well. So refreshing! 

I'm a FC super fan. It IS pricy, that I cannot deny, but you get what you pay for and here it is super fresh, good quality food that leaves you feeling great! I'll see you soon FC fam!"}
{"text":"Love Flower Child...great healthy tasty food. Love the interior decor too. A tad noisy , but with cooler weather approaching, outside seating can rectify that. Beats fast food, crappy food and pricey food. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Really good food, very good iced tea.  Pricy but it's clean food so if that is even a little important to you, I think price is justified.  Great clean space too, very cool atmosphere, great service too."}
{"text":"Really excited to try this place. But made the mistake trying to go at lunchtime. The line was super long and barely moving. After awhile I decided I'll have to try it another time since all the tables were occupied anyways."}
{"text":"Just came to this restaurant for the first time for lunch, I had a feeling it was going to be a good experience, and it exceeded my expectations beyond! I had the Mother Earth bowl, the flavors were amazing and normally I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, however they were prepared to perfection here! The atmosphere was busy, but that didn't take away from the quality of food or service, every one was so friendly and professional, I'm already craving to go back and try more dishes! Las Vegas needed a restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"Always good. I try something different every time. Although basically run for young kids probably under 30, they are always friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"Even though it's always busy the service is fast. The food is delicious! As a vegetarian it's easily one of my favorite spots. The lemonade is the real mvp of the whole experience, you can create the most amazing Arnold palmers!! It's easy to rack up a bill but never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant place for a light healthy meal. It is spacious, airy, with a name that pretty much reflects the 60s vibe you find inside. Ordering is simple: at the counter near the entrance, from a menu that is none too extensive. I tried their sauteed spinach, which had a mild garlic flavor with a hint of citrus. I love the GF mac and cheese - it was really rich and tasty, which I didn't expect from a gluten-free dish. The wild mushroom pho was a bit of a letdown for me, maybe because I love the traditional pho served in Vietnamese restaurants and the vegan version in Flower Child had no similarity to traditional pho, save for the fresh herbs and bean sprouts served on the side. Service is friendly, there's always a place to sit even during peak hours, thanks to the patio area, and parking is never a problem in the Uptown Plaza where this establishment is located."}
{"text":"I officially hate myself for liking this place so much. I mean, could I be more of a yuppie right now? 

Whatever. I don't care that it's overpriced. I'm lazy and need to eat better. Just keep feeding me quinoa that actually tastes good and I'll keep spending all the money I was supposed to put into an IRA on salmon and gluten-free cookies."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is delicious and fresh. Lots of options for proteins, vegetarian, and gluten free meals. Great iced tea and lemonade selection. I never wait long here and there is a plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Just wish there was one closer to my house. I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"The salmon is amazing! They pay attention to any health diet and want to make it right for yo. Every time I have come here it has been amazing and so yummy! I always leave here wanting to come back here the next day. If you are on the Whole30 this is def the place to go. So good!"}
{"text":"First time i was here (6-7months ago) i made the mistake of ordering pho not realizing it has cinnamon on it. Just never expected cinnamon to be put on traditional vietnamese noodle dish.

Anyway, the manager happened to be walking around and asked if I like my meal. I told him I wasnt expecting cinnamon but it was my fault I didnt read the menu closely. He insisted on getting me something else (Never asked for it or insinuate I need to be compensated). That initiative is pretty rare. Anyway he got me a wrap instead and it was yummy.

I came back after that and tried different things. My favorite is the indian spiced cauliflower. Seriously that stuff was BOMB.

I would rate this place 4.5. .5 because some of the people back at the register can be unfriendly/rude. Gave you attitude too which in its own way I found quite entertaining. I never had issue with the servers however. They were friendly and appeared accomodating.

Would like to note though, the ones handling the cash register is generally the first point of contact a new customer will meet. If they experience a poor treatment here and decided the rest of experience suck from that one intetaction, you are likely to lose new customer and whoever else they would have bring next time."}
{"text":"They need nutrition information available if they are going to tout themselves as healthy.
Forbidden rice -delicious but skimpy on the chicken.  For $5 more I expected a more substantial amount as I needed a magnifying glass to see it in my dish.  Mentioned it to cashier and got a side of chicken within minutes.  Not sure I'll be running back."}
{"text":"If you're a vegan or vegetarian you MUST come here. I seriously wish they would open thiis exact restaurant in Chicago. Not exaggerating, it was the best vegetarian meal I've had in a long time. My bowl was the one with the ancient grains, sweet potatoe, portabella mushroom, avocado, cucumber, charred onions, leafy greens, red peppers, misa vinaigrette, hemp seed, and my favorite- broccali pesto! My mouth waters just thinking about it..soo much flavor. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice as well. We sat outside and it was lovely and the staff was very welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Took my daughter who is a healthy vegetarian. I had the Rebel Wrap which is apparently named that because it is filled with steak. It was absolutely delicious. My daughter had a salad with tofu add on. She loved hers as well.
The service was friendly and efficient. I would definitely go back even if she was not with me. The only reason I did not give it five stars is interestingly, because of its popularity. At lunchtime the line was out the door this 111 degree day, and once inside it was very very noisy. Probably best at an off hour, but try it."}
{"text":"Brussel.Sprouts.on.point!!!!

First of all, it is the most adorable place. I loved the outdoor seating, definitely got the French vibes. And inside was just as great. I ordered the mix n match (brussel sprouts, butternut squash and japanese style eggplant) with salmon. Holy moly it was fantastic. 

Please start a Flower Child in Atlanta!! Pretty please!"}
{"text":"Now here's a Fox Restaurant Concept I can get behind (well, mostly).  The prices are still exorbitant for what you get (hence the reason I can't give this 5 stars), but that's the story of the entire Fox family.  Like Sauce, Flower Child is a fast casual concept.  Step in, order your food and pay at the counter, and seat yourself.  Unlike Sauce however, you're given a lot of freedom to customize your meal in a multitude of ways.  And the menu is decidedly on the healthier end.  Tonight I came with my siblings for the newest Fox experience.

The restaurant is located across the street from the Henry, on the northeast corner of 44th and Camelback just behind the Schmidt Jewelers.  When you step inside it almost feels like a health food restaurant.  I'm not sure why, but the color scheme and the setup just gives off that type of vibe.  Not a hipster or hippie vibe, more like an indoor farmers market vibe.  At any rate, we came around 6pm on a Sunday.  It was starting to get busy but there was still plenty of seating available inside.

I decided to go with a veggie & grain bowl as those are the most customizable of the menu.  You choose one of four proteins and then add 1, 2, or 3 amongst 12 possible side items.  For my protein, I went with the salmon.  For the sides, I went with the roasted veggies, organic mashed potatoes, and seasonal fruit.  They also have more exotic options like quinoa, kale, sweet potatoes, and even soba noodles.  For a drink I went with lemonade.  They actually have about a half dozen lemonades you can choose from at their lemonade dispenser (all mixed in house).  I went traditional and chose the house lemonade.  Total cost for my bowl and lemonade was $20.  Yup, its pricey, though I guess the silver lining was that I didn't have to tip anyone.

Took less than 10 minutes for them to bring the food to our table.  The presentation was impressive and the portions were adequate (I was actually expecting smaller).  In terms of taste, I was actually pretty impressed.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and had enough where it felt like a main course of the dish.  I was actually really surprised how good the veggies were.  Some of them had a good char on them but it didn't detract from the taste at all.  The potatoes were super creamy without feeling like I was scooping up a butter bomb.  And the fruit bowl was very fresh.  And maybe Sam Fox was listening to me when I said I despised all the pulp I had in my lemonade at the Henry.  Here, there wasn't a trace of pulp in my lemonade.  Thank goodness.  

The service we received was excellent.  Granted there wasn't much of it to be had since its fast casual, but the gals at the register were friendly and helpful with the menu and the woman who brought our food and took our plates was also very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  By the time we were done, the place was jam packed with Arcadia residents, but it still felt comfortable to us.

So alright Sam Fox, we haven't seen eye to eye very often, but you might actually be on to something with this concept.  For the health conscious and foodies alike, there's a lot to like about this place.  The prices are still steep for what you're doling out, but at least here you're doling out some really good quality food, quality service, and the always quintessential Fox atmosphere.  And at least here we the customers have some say over the look of our food.  And once again Sam, thank you for expelling the pulp from my lemonade."}
{"text":"I went here for Saturday lunch with some friends and it was perfect. I want this in my neighborhood SO BAD. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and everything was delicious. I loved the complimentary flavored water, the soups, the veggies, and especially the gluten-free desserts (although they were my downfall.) The brownie was hands-down the best brownie I've ever had anywhere. The chicken curry dish was also exceptional - so flavorful and the chicken so tender. If I was going to create a restaurant, this would be it. Quality creative food, phenomenal service, and reasonable prices - a winner. And if you eat Paleo, you'll be good...if you can avoid the desserts. Personally, I failed at that :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed some quality flavorful food. Customer service was not the best. A smiling face and welcome is helpful, but did not get it. They should have someone greeting. Also have some simple understanding of the how the number and table system works. Location was good, clean and uplifting. Had the Udon noodles with chicken. Child had the chicken with smashed potatoes and mac & cheese. (Mac & cheese was a little \"off\" tasting). Not sure why they would bring a child a very hot plate?! Noodles for bowl of soup was a bit too hot as well. Could've used more chicken in it since you have to pay an additional fee for it. My bowl only had a few small pieces. Drink options good and plenty. Will try again. But overall, a good filling and healthy meal option."}
{"text":"Although there was a bit of a line when we arrived, the service was quick. The food here never disappoints. Healthy and delicious! I love the fresh fruit infused water available while you wait.
I have been to this restaurant several times and will continue to frequent Flower Child. 
The only drawback is that ordering a drink with your meal can be pricey. Forgo the drink, grab some of that infused water and it's all good! 
Spring for dessert if you have room! The brownie was soft, rich, chocolatey goodness."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat on this side of town. A friend recommended it, so I decided sure.... let's try it. They have salads, wraps and bowls. Protein is on the side. I tried the vietemese salad. It was tangy and very fresh. I came during prime rush hour, noon.  I did manage to get a table. Lol. Menu is simple, there was only pita bread as a bread option but not included in the salad. They had one yellow cupcake as a option as far a breads go. Baskets at register have brownies and cookies for sale. If you are in the neighborhood, looking for a unique quick bite, try flower child. They also have a very unique selections of teas and lemonades."}
{"text":"I have never tried something here that I didn't absolutely love! My favorites right now are the Mother Earth Bowl, the Late Riser, gluten free Mac and cheese, smashed potatoes, corn and quinoa, and all their lemonades! 

I also love the Hydration station out front before you walk inside. This is a great place to take kids since you can get very healthy and customized kids meals for a good price! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Their selection of healthy  eats are so mouthwatering just reading the description and certainly lived up to my expectations. I had their avocado smash and vegan salad both of which were savory and delicious. An establishment like this would be very popular in the Bay. Please think of opening one there- you're already guaranteed a fan!"}
{"text":"Flower child is my favorite place to eat at! Everything on their menu is healthy and incredibly delicious! I've brought many friends to this place for their first time and they always love it! The special teas and drinks they have here are yummie and I'm slightly obsessed with their desserts! The customer service at this Flower child is awesome too! They are very dog friendly on the patio too. Oh, I almost forgot about the decor... which I am extremely obsessed with. I love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Healthy eating in a fun atmosphere. Im a vegetarian; my husband isnt so I was thrilled he wanted to go. Theres protein options so theres really something for everyone. 
The 3 of us all had wraps - chicken, steak and veggie. All came with a small salad. We also got a side of mac and cheese - good flavor but the texture was different. 
The wraps were large amd tasty. The workers were all friendly and very happy. 
Its such a clean, bright, cheery place.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can't give this place enough stars and praise! Since it opened (barely a month ago), my friends and I go here ALL.THE.TIME!!! And I'm not kidding when I say all the time... we just can't help it. The food is fresh, tasty and healthy -- where can you go wrong? (Okay, okay, maybe the part where you \"go wrong\" is that it IS a bit pricey... but then again, can you REALLY put a price on your health?)

I highly recommend the \"Mother Earth\" bowl with chicken (or steak, you can't ever go wrong with steak). The healthy goodness is an explosion of flavors that all get to party in your mouth with each bite; it's my favorite! I also like the \"Late Riser\" for the days when I don't have time to have breakfast, since it has an egg in there as well -- it's almost like brunch in a bowl. 

My friend really loves the vegan Caesar... she says the dressing is soooo good she could just do shots of it! And it's jam-packed full of nutritional goodness. The \"Flying Avocado\" is so mouth-wateringly delicious as well! And that avocado hummus... oh my! (Just wish they'd give you more of it.) 

If you're into mix 'n matching, the grass-fed steak, with Indian Spiced Cauliflower and red chili glazed sweet potatoes are amazing and will leave both stomach and tastebuds jumping for joy!!! Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order from their menu -- it's healthy, filling, nutritious, and oh so good. 

The only down fall is that the line is out the door around the lunch hour, so it's good to phone in the order so you can sneak in and grab it while others are waiting in line. Just beware -- when grabbing a to-go order, be sure to check the amount of food you receive, because a lot of the time, you'll get jipped on your portion size. Both my friend and I have ordered the same exact dishes while dining in and also to-go, and the portion sizes definitely differ; not sure if they're in a hurry and don't pay attention to how much food they give you or what. Other than that, I am a flower child! :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Flower Child for about two years now, and I used to absolutely love it. It was one of my favorite places to go when I felt like treating myself. 

However, I have noticed in recent times, both the quality and quantity of the food has been falling at a steady rate.

I used to get the madras curry with a side of chicken (which is very pricey for what it is because protein is not included with the dish [$13.00 + $5.00 = $18.00 plus tax]) and it was great. The flavors were fantastic, the chicken was cooked nicely and it wasn't dry. However, recently I've noticed the side of protein (which COSTS $5.00 EXTRA) has been getting smaller and smaller in size. The last time I went, I only received 4 small slices of chicken. Unacceptable, considering it doesn't even come with the dish. Also, the dish has been served with barely any sauce recently too, which makes its pretty dry and unappetizing.

My brother used to come with me and he would order the kids meal, which was an amazing deal, because it used to come with a lot and it tasted delicious ($6.00). I noticed that the quality of the kids meal has gone down severely. My most recent visit has me shocked that this establishment would dare serve something as pitiful as they did. For reference, I am going to attach a picture of how the kids meal used to look (around 2 yrs ago) compared to how it looked tonight. 

Note the lack of chicken and lack of Mac n Cheese in the most recent order (AND that was a double side of Mac n Cheese). The price has not gone down, so I don't see why the quality/quantity has to take a hit. 

This is what happens when a company gets too comfortable with their success. It makes me feel that they no longer want to put any effort into gaining new customers or maintaining old ones.

Flower Child should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. I'm sad to say they have finally lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe I am becoming such a Fox Concept Restaurant fan.  This is another winner.  I am on a no carb diet and the options here are amazing.  If you want healthy and tasty fare, this is the place to come.  I love, love the chopped vegetable salad with the grass fed steak or the salmon.  After my first introduction to this place, I realized I had been three times in one week.  I had to make excuses to drive to the area, so I could go eat there.  It is a good 25 to 30 miles from my home in far north Scottsdale (yes, that is where BFE is).   I had a taste of the avocado hummus and it was delicious.  My kids and husband had the little lemon cake and they devoured it.  My salmon was perfectly cooked last time I was there.  I love their teas, specially the acai hibiscus one, can't wait to try the lemonades."}
{"text":"This is excellent for a healthy light lunch. I got the skinny cobb with chicken and the lemonade.

Lunch
* Skinny Cobb (Excellent)
* Lemonade (Excellent)"}
{"text":"I've only had the late riser-quinoa, eggs, sauce, beans, greek yogurt-yum! I topped it with chicken. They have kombucha on tap and it's fantastic. A ton of lemonades as well. For dessert I had a mini chocolate cake and it was fantastic as well. 

This is a Fox Concept restaurant - same ownership as True Food North Italia - but at what I would classify as a more reasonable price point :)!

Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Outstanding fresh and natural food, with many gluten-free, vegan, and nondairy choices.  I travel to Scottsdale frequently for work, but I only stay three days. On this most recent visit, I came to this place twice!  

I highly recommend making a meal of the sides. You can get three of them for nine dollars. The sautéed spinach was perfect... A blend of garlic and lemon. I also really enjoyed the Indian curry cauliflower, spicy Japanese eggplant, and sweet and spicy sweet potatoes.  Also in the divine category was the avocado hummus blend. It was served with fresh corn, pepitas, and a radish, and the Pita that accompanied it was a perfect soft texture.

And please save room for dessert. As someone who tries to avoid dairy food, it's rare to find delicious nondairy desserts.  Definitely try the olive oil lemon cake.  It was sweet and savory at the same time!

So you may be wondering, why not five stars? The place is a little bit overpriced. For example the aforementioned lemon cake was the size of a cupcake, and they charge three dollars for it!"}
{"text":"Deciding to meet my girlfriend here was an easy choice since it is close to her college.  The parking lot was jammed packed at 12:30 due to the parking lot re-pavement.  However, we were not easily discouraged and kept circling.  MANY other people were doing the same thing and walking towards Flower Child.  
Immediately upon entering the patio, Flower Child's casual trendy vibe was on  display.  Patrons were sitting in the beautiful Arizona autumn outdoors and inside the spacious restaurant. 
Multiple workers greeted us and informed me of the ordering protocol.  ALL the workers appeared happy and were efficient.  
The counter ordering style allowed fast service  which would be beneficial if we were on  a traditional lunch hour.  
The vast menu was incredible.  From salads to wraps to bowls to desserts and ALL with interesting mixes of flavors. 
We ordered at the counter, took seats outside and were served our lunch.
We started with gluten free pumpkin muffins that were absolutely the most moist ever.  I had the Brussels Sprouts salad and my friend had beef with Brussels sprouts on the side.  The salad dressing was barely detectable which made every ingredient pop in my mouth (nuts, cheese, spinach, butternut squash).  It was as delicious as it was beautiful.  My friend's lunch was equally delicious by her gleeful face.  We managed to clean our plates in spite of our lively conversations. 
The tea and lemonade bar had unusual flavors.  I enjoyed the pomegranate and ginger selection.
I would highly recommend Flower Child to the patron who enjoys crisp flavors mixed creatively.  The menu is huge and I definitely need to return many more times to try more items. 
The only thing I would change about my visit would be the music volume. It was such that I felt other customers and I needed to talk above a normal level to be heard.  Outside on the patio, music was not an issue.  
Happy employees = Happy establishment = Happy Customers."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I haven't always been a fan of Fox Concept restaurants, but this place has made me reconsider. First of all, I think the Uptown Plaza is going to be the next happening place in Phoenix with all the next restaurants moving in and the remodeling they are doing. This is Flower Child's third location. They promote healthy eating and divide their menu among salads, vegetable bowls and wraps. I got the Mother Earth Bowl - a mix of grains, sweet potato, avocado, broccoli pesto and leafy greens. It's a popular choice and had lots of flavor (and I didn't add any protein). The decor of this place is beautiful and definitely a great place to stop in for lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Not as good as the Phoenix location. I had the kale salad but no nuts or cheese were in it.  My spouse had the salmon bowl but the sweet potatoes were very dry and the salmon was just okay."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking cute! I came here with one of my girlfriends.  The food is always so fresh and both the interior and exterior are always pristine! We sat outside and the vase on our table had fresh flowers. So lovely.  It's these little things that really make the experience! I'd love to come here around the evening.  It's probably a spectacular location to watch the sunset.

Parking isn't too much trouble, but the lot is a little small and tight.  Also, the prices are a little high - but hey, everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Though it was a little pricey it was nice to get off campus, eat some healthy food, and enjoy the atmosphere & flower child did just that for me! Very friendly staff and they were super helpful, I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Flower Child was a pleasant surprise. I'm not gonna lie - I am not the healthiest eater. With that being said, I was skeptical about Flower Child. I had the preconceived notion that I wouldn't like it, and initially just wanted to eat there just for the sake of being able to say I tried it. Boy, was I wrong. First off, Flower Child blew me away with how gorgeous the entire restaurant is. It reminded me of something you would see in HGTV. The service was excellent, with most of the employees wearing something that resembled a Free People catalog. 

I ordered the thai cashew quinoa with chicken. It was super delicious. I am usually not a fan of quinoa. All the ingredients blended well together. I could totally have it everyday. It was very tasty, and it may have soy sauce in it (which may constitute as unhealthy depending on the amount of soy sauce), but I am not going to complain. I enjoyed every bite! 

My boyfriend had one of the breakfast bowls (I can't remember what it's called) but he enjoyed it very much as well. The only negative aspect I can think of are the prices. They are definitely not cheap and I cannot justify spending that much for their food. Regardless, I liked Flower Child and will be back to try their salads!"}
{"text":"Good food very tasty. Had the mother bowl and vietnamese crunch. Lots of vegetarian options"}
{"text":"What a great place to get something a little different.  My family and I have tried several dishes and they are all a little different but awesome!  We have found nothing we don't like.  They are busy but have very friendly organized staff and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great place to get something a little different.  My family and I have tried several dishes and they are all a little different but awesome!  We have found nothing we don't like.  They are busy but have very friendly and organized staff and a nice atmosphere.  I do think they are overpriced and, as another reviewer noted in Scotts, $5 for a few slices of chicken added to your salad it too much to pay."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this because a) Fox Restaurant Concepts and b) every time I go by one, the line is out the door!

So, finally made the time to go for lunch today.  The reason the line is out the door is because you order at the counter just inside the door.  While we waited, someone found a table for us and put our number on it, so as soon as we ordered, we sat down.

The menu is intimidating for someone who isn't a huge organic/sustainable/locavore/glutenfree/healthfood person, but I ordered a wrap - The Rebel - this is a grass fed steak wrap, and I will say it was the best wrap I have ever tried.  Wow!  One of my lunch mates got the Madras Curry bowl with Chicken, and the other got the Chopped Vegetable Salad with 'Sustainable' salmon.  They both said their food was terrific, and we sent back plates that weren't quite licked clean, but only because it would've been a breach of decorum to do so.

Interesting crowd - it looked to be about 80% young females in the 15-35 age range - based on this observation, if I ever want to target that crowd for a business, I'm going to make sure to feature 'organic' and 'sustainable' and 'free range' and etc. on my advertising!  

The only real knock is that it's pretty pricey for lunch (about $18/ea with fountain drinks), so too expensive to be on the regular rotation, but a great place for a 'treat' lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat out when in the Phoenix area. The flavor a and thoughtfulness of the food keep me coming back. Also, there is no guilt when I leave full because it's all great stuff for my body. This place got it right!  The tea bar is perfect: mix and match or stick to one. The service and atmosphere are terrific! I haven't tried the brunch yet. I doubt they will disappoint."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  I can't believe I just wasted my money on that place.  Super overpriced and disgusting.  My friend and I ordered Mac & Cheese and it came out right away (Yay! Super fast service!) but it tasted like it was sitting out for four days and then reheated in an Easy Bake Oven.  

Do NOT eat the macaroni unless you want to feel like DYING.

I've heard their salads are good just do not get the mac!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. My daughter ordered the avocado toast and ask to substitute the egg for some fruit and i ordered a salad.  We paid the ticket and sat down and waited for our food.  They delivered her toast and my salad. She asked about the side of fruit. Shortly after that, a man came to the table with a very very small bowl and set it down on the table. He proceeded to scold us that we are not allowed to substitute fruit for the egg.  He said he was generous enough to do it this time only and basically walked away.  Im not sure why a customer was scolded for a sub on food.  We asked at the register and they said sure, no issue mentioned.  This employees irritation with an illegal substitution was directed at the wrong person.  Pretty much tainted the restaurant for us.  Toast was pretty measly for price.  First Watch is far superior with their avocado toast."}
{"text":"We came here for my friends bachelorette party. We had spent a day at the spa and wanted something healthy and delicious to complement a beautiful relaxing day. The service was amazing. The food was delicious! I had the Strawberry Fields Salad with Salmon and really enjoyed it! I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Another cool atmosphere like everyone had mentioned, got there at 11:30 before the \"lunch rush\" and enjoyed my tofu wrap. Great place to hang & chat on the patio. Another great addition to Arcadia! Definitely a keeper in my book & won't be my last visit."}
{"text":"The vibe of this restaurant is who I aspire to be as a person: free-spirited, boho chic, and healthy lol. There are a lot of delicious choices on the menu including the option to create an entree from vegetable sides. My favorite thing here is actually their lemonade since you can get unlimited refills. There are three different flavors including the original, apple cinnamon, and one other. I tend to mix the flavors together when I want to make something fun."}
{"text":"Simply the best, healthiest food in town, period. I only wish they opened earlier, closed later, and had a location in the east valley. The Indian spiced cauliflower is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Forbidden rice bowl is phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"I truly get excited to eat here. Everything I've had is delicious and it's actually healthy food, unlike Chop Shop, Grabba Green, and many other \"pseudo-healthy\" restaurants. 
I've seen some complaints on prices, but if you consider that you're getting food extremely fast and not tipping 20%, it's a great value. You can also buy $100 in Fox gift cards at Costco for $80, and they give you 10% off your order if you follow @eatflowerchild on Instagram."}
{"text":"I've visited a few Flower Child locations and the experience has been consistently great. I usually make my own 3-ingredient vegan, gluten-free bowl and each one has been delicious. Portion sizes could be a bit bigger, and otherwise it's a great value."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. The upscale boho vibe is friendly and welcoming, and the menu is great. I enjoyed the Thai Dye wrap and a strawberry based juice. Can't wait to go back and try something else. They have ample shaded outdoor seating, so it will be a nice al fresco place as long as Vegas isn't under a heat advisory like today."}
{"text":"Great place to go and grab lunch! It's healthy and quick. You're food comes out quite fast. There isn't one thing on the menu that I didn't like. I would for sure go ahead and give this place a try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"This definitely seems like one of the \"places to be in Arcadia\". You'll have a mix of families, Arcadia moms, health conscious crowds and ladies clubs but that aside it's definitely a very enjoyable place and the food is of good if not great quality though perhaps slightly on the bland side (but that's better for me than too salty or too spicy).  my favorite dish is the Flying Avocado, a wrap with grilled chicken, gouda cheese, romaine,  tomato, avocado and hummus. I look forward to going to be again though perhaps not often since it's out of my area but I can definitely recommend it and believe they will be adding a new location soon from what I heard from the chef."}
{"text":"Had the vegan poke bowl and loved it! Friendly staffs and chilled atmosphere. Love their vast drink selections!"}
{"text":"Many vegan options. I had the vegan poke bowl and I love the marinated beet!  Causal and inviting environment. I love their many choice of fruit teas. It's where I would pick for a friend's meetup. Very easy to find and central location. Sometimes it's hard to find parking."}
{"text":"Best food ever wish there was one in the state i live in. i would eat there every day!!!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite place!  The food is well prepared, it's unique and very healthy.  The service is usually fast and friendly!  We plan to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Good food for the price.  Good Salmon.  Everything tasted great and food was brought out within 15 minutes.  Everything is cooked to order.  Lot of people there but moves quickly.  Lots of yoga pants.  

SUMMERLIN APPROVED."}
{"text":"I love Flower Child! This is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in town. Won't you please come to San Francisco? 

I've tried many of their dishes, and enjoy everything. My favorite is the kale salad with a piece of salmon added on top. Ingredients are fresh, portion size ample, salad not overdressed, simply delicious. The other day I also had the avocado toast with egg which is yummy but waaay overpriced at $7 for a single slice of toast (even by SF standards) 

Service is on point. We arrived on a Thursday during lunch rush hour and the line to order was about 15-20 people deep. There were no seats available (this is one of those places where you order, get a number, find yourself a table, and then someone brings your food to you when it's ready).  The manager did an excellent job explaining the situation to us, securing a table for each customer, and managing the timing of ordering so nobody's food would be brought out before a table was secured. What could have been a very annoying and chaotic situation was handled with complete ease. 

The service workers there are all super sweet and friendly. From the gal that took our order, to the dude that brought the food, to another gal that cleared our dishes. All smiles and friendly faces. Happy happy. Refreshing. 

Other random tidbits:
There's a lovely cold fruit water stand outside to help keep you cool and hydrated while standing in line. 

Lastly, the bathrooms are nice including a big hook to hang your bag. Not gross, dingy, or disgusting.

I hope Flower Child makes it to San Francisco someday. Until then, I will continue to visit whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love the wraps, love the salads. Hard to not finding something you don't like. Super clean, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Been eating at the Arcadia location for some time.  Have always been a big promoter but lately I have found the sweet potato side to be tough...like it's cooked differently...maybe pre-cooked and reheated?  Also, find it a bit annoying that in this day and age when an expensive lunch ($15-18) restaurant doesn't offer free wifi.  With these prices, it would be a nice perk..."}
{"text":"What a great gem. Healthy and tasty food. Even the kids menu is healthy and filled with great choices- now that's rare.

You have to make sure you get a table before you order you food at the counter, but it was pretty efficient. The décor is beautiful (even the bathrooms).

There are plenty of gluten free and vegetarian options. The salmon bowl and the beef bowl were great. We also loved the avocado hummus combo.

They have great options of real fresh lemonade and juice combos as well as great iced teas.

Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot, reminds me of all the \"pseudo healthy\" restaurants in California for all the yoga moms to feel better about themselves ... docked 1 star because all of the food we got was a bit too saucey/salty. Can't let the yoga moms bloat, you know??"}
{"text":"Why does healthy have to be so expensive?

We came across Flower Child looking for a place for a lunch and ended up spending over $30 for two salads. They were two delicious salads but it they were still pricey. I had the kale salad with chicken. It was light and bright with the grapefruit and apples and my lunch date had the chopped salad. The highlight of lunch on this warm day was the lemonade. I could have drank that rose lemonade all day long until I floated away. The cucumber was tasty as well.

The restaurant itself was a comfortable casual and the staff was friendly. You order at the counter here and they give you a number and you can watch them work in the kitchen while you you wait for them to bring you your food. There is also outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My pho (broth soup) was 'good' but not worth $13.00, it was meatless and was not filling - i cannot justify that price for a broth soup. Left feeling a bit ripped off."}
{"text":"Another Fox restaurant, the same old experience. First the good...like any Fox concept restaurant, the interior is extremely well done. Whoever the interior designers are for all of these places do a great job. The staff at this Flower Child was very good as well. I went twice on opening week and each time things were smooth, organized, and employees were very friendly. 

As for the food, I've had the Rebel wrap which tasted pretty good and some chicken with a side of soba noodles and sweet potato, which also tasted good, but nothing earth shattering. Both times I walked out with a bill of close to $17-18 and was still hungry. The portion sizes are EXTREMELY small. This place is way overpriced. I did notice both times this place was mostly females eating and thought maybe the portion sizes are geared more towards that demographic. I would not recommend this place to men at all. Unless you spend $25 or more for food, you will be hungry. 
I also have to say that the lemonade that comes highly recommended is horrible. If you have water at home and some Country Time mix, you can achieve the same taste as what they charge $4 here for. 

Overall, we are in Scottsdale and places like this will thrive. I try and want to like the Fox concept places, but each time, walk away disappointed. This place is nothing more than a lower cost True Food, yet still way over priced for the food you get. In my humble opinion, for healthy food in a similar atmosphere, Pita Jungle is much better than Flower Child."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options. Lots of options to choose from. Everyone got something different to share and it was all great. I had the chopped veggie salad which was really good but i will say the ginger dressing was a little overpowering. My only complaint"}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum!! A friend recommended I stop here because I was about to hit ugly traffic. I had the Bird is the Word, no onion and dressing on the side. It was DELISH! I didn't even use the dressing because it had so much flavor. I wish there was on in the SE valley so u could try more menu items. Also...no nutritional facts yet but they're reportedly coming soon.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite with family or friends, small or large groups all work.  The salads are fresh and you won't leave full but just right.  Everything is well prepared and fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the other FRC restaurants so I just had to try Flower Child! It definitely did not disappoint, in fact, it might be my new favorite from the company!
First of all, I really like the decor at this location - it's really cute and bohemian and modern. It's nice that it has the fast-casual type of ordering so you can order first and choose where to sit. The entire place is really reminiscent of Chop Shop to me.
I chose the Mother Earth bowl and loved it! Everything paired together really well, and each component of it was well done! I particularly really liked the roasted sweet potatoes and the broccoli pesto.
I feel like $10 is pretty average for a bowl at similar eateries. The only thing I question is that it's $5 just to add chicken to a bowl - that seems a little much to me considering it's half the price of the entire bowl.
Overall, I really liked Flower Child. Good food, large selection, and a lively atmosphere makes for a perfect place to meet up with friends!"}
{"text":"Love all their salads!! The chicken wrap is amazing!! All their desserts are the BOMB!!! Excellent place for lunch!!
Love love love the vegan salad with grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"Came the other day for lunch. the food was decent but the prices are a RIP OFF!!!  For my wife and I the bill was $58 for bowls and drinks.  Plenty of other good places that are priced right."}
{"text":"Cool vibe place with an enclitic menu. Shared a Wrap and a side salad between two of us and was good amount of food. Would not have been able to Eat full plate alone. Defiantly will go back and try something new ! Staff was super friendly and Very helpful"}
{"text":"Lots of healthy/healthier options that taste great, wrapped up in a fun, whimsical space. 

Flower Child packs a punch in the flavor department. In spite of the tastiness, the items are generally light and feel-good in nature, so you leave feeling good about what you ate. The portions are a little on the small side, but that tends to be the norm with food in this vein. An adult is typically going to pay $17 - $23 for food, if you're looking to fill up on a normal size meal, though you could spend as little as $9 - $13 if you're eating extra-lite. 

Flower Child offers assortments of salads, bowls, wraps, and build-your-own plates. Lots of California, Asian, and Mediterranean influences are found throughout the menu. You could easily come here over and over again and not get tired of the food, based on the numerous options available. The menu is also clearly marked with Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten-Free options to make those choices easy to find.

My love and I came in with our girls and one of their friends. We order:
- Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl, with Salmon
- Thai Dye Wrap
- Flying Avocado Wrap
- A Two Item Plate of Sauteed Spinach and Clementine & Organic Apple, with Chicken as an additional Protein add-on
- A Three Item Plate of Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Smashed Organic Potato, Gluten-free Mac & Cheese, with Chicken as an additional Protein add-on

On a return visit I tried the Forbidden Rice Bowl, and The Red Chili Glazed Sweet Potatoes, and the Mother Earth Bowl. These were a couple of my favorites, though I also really enjoyed the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl, with Salmon.

The ambiance is nice. I was expecting a little more of a hipster feel, but I was pleasantly surprised with equal parts hipster, sunshine, hippie, flowers, and of course, the unavoidable big box modern food corporation overtones. There is a large indoor dining area, as well as a huge patio that includes a large covered, highly-protected portion, surrounded on three sides. 

Flower Child is certainly a place I'll be back to."}
{"text":"-Food is average and the staff are not familiar with the ingredients for diners with food allergies.
-Portions are on the small side for the price paid.  I had to pay extra to swap out pita bread for veggies in my hummus....making my side of hummus $12.  Ouch!  
-I'm happy that Flower Child is around so healthy eating becomes more popular with regular Americans"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at this location; first review. Purchased a salad with steak. The meat was rancid (smell and taste). I immediately returned it and they offered to remake. I asked for salmon instead and recommended they check all of the steak because someone can get sick. The employees were apologetic. I was not contacted by manager. After leaving, I began to feel nauseous so I called back to make sure that a manager was aware and to ensure proper inspection of the steak. Still giving 3 stars because my other visits were fine and my daughter's food was okay but I wonder how they ensure the freshness of their food."}
{"text":"There's just one problem--ordering the food. There is usually just one person at the order station who will take your order after they finish taking phone orders and taking the money for take-out orders, this is pretty frustrating!"}
{"text":"My first time to Flower Child and I was totally 100% impressed.   First of all the design and the layout of the restaurant was really well done.

The staff was friendly and totally professional. 

The menu selection gives you many choices such as different salads with the option to add proteins 
such as Tofu, Steak, Salmon or chicken.  If you are a vegetarian this restaurant is a great choice.
All the dishes are prepared with out meat, but you can add it if you wish.

I had The Mediterranean Diet salad with tofu.
Excellent choice.  Totally fresh!

It is advertised that they use local produce and organic items.      This was the best salad I have had in a very long time!   I will be back....SOON!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got a fresh salad with salmon on top. The dressing, the salmon, and salad were all exceptional. I highly recommend Flower Child!"}
{"text":"Amazing new spot that I can take my friends to when I want something \"light\". This place is clean and trendy, and perfect for those who love to take photos of their food- their food presentation is excellent. 

I had the Viet salad with tofu- never had tofu with my salad but it was an amazing combo! My mother got the forbidden rice with shaved beef and she loved it. My sister ordered the Thai wrap and it was good- just wish that the wrap was a little thicker (it came really skinny).

I also ordered the Avocado Hummus as suggested on yelp and I'm so glad I did.. it's so good! As for pricing, it may be a few bucks more than regular places but it's well worth cause you're getting quality food. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh just by looking at the dish, and when you taste it you can confirm your assumption."}
{"text":"I love this place. Eggplant, sweet potatoes and quinoa are all very flavorful. The service is friendly and fast, and the choices of tea was great. Even the hubby was able to add grass fed beef to his bowl. I also appreciated that the portion sizes aren't huge. Just enough to get a healthy dose of good tasting, and good for you food. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere there was a little line out the door around noonish but it went quick.. first time there and it was good.. I ordered the 3 item w spicy eggplant curried cauliflower and green beans no protein because I'm content with that... it was a little salty I must admit but it was non the less great tasting... they have a cute little condiment station along with crayons and a etch-a-sketch that my little loved... I got her a kids meal with Mac n cheese brown rice and steak.. my friend got also the 3 item with eggplant asparagus and corn quinoa with tofu and she scarfed hers down like there was no tomorrow lol it was great till the lady next to us told us to keep it down because my little one was watching something on YouTube.. well 1 it was not even that loud.. 2 it was so loud in there because the place was busy and there was a lot of background noise anyways the employees were nice and the teas were good"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Shared the Vegan Ceaser salad (which didn't really taste like ceaser salad but had a nice tahini lemon taste) and a quinoa dish with tofu. Line to order was very long for this recently opened location (showed it's popularity around dinner time on a Wednesday night). Staff was friendly in finding tables for guests while they waited in line. Place was very neat and clean. Liked that they had cucmber mint water. I would go back but maybe get a different dish. Pricing seemed reasonable. Next time may want to try the mix and match option."}
{"text":"Awesome options for everybody including meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans.  Very creative and delicious menu.  Amazing lemonade and tea."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Healthy fresh and clean and very filling. I love this place! Everything on the menu is perfection! I wish more fast food/ easy eating would head in this direction and follow in its footsteps!"}
{"text":"My first Sam Fox experience.  This place is really good and organized thoughtfully.  It is busy and loud inside, but does offer a nice patio.  You are greeted right away and they offer infused water while waiting in line.  The hostess shows you your table number and makes sure you know to tell the cashier your number.  

Once your order is placed, you head over to the beverage area and get your drink.  They offer many good teas and lemonaides.  

I had the kale salad with salmon on top.  It was delicious and very refreshing.  So nice to leave a restaurant and not feel heavy or ill.  Most restaurants have major portion-distortion.

All the employees were very helpful and friendly as well.  Very nicely done."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Get the mother earth bowl. I love the atmosphere. They have a great little outdoor patio area. They have fresh juices as well. Whenever I have a craving for something healthy, delicious and vegan I try to go here. The meals are so good and really satisfying. I will spend 15-20 here on lunch so a little more than cheap but totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love the food at all the Fox Concept restaurants...this place is no exception. #instaworthy 

Great iced tea and lemonade flavors. Everything is fresh and healthy though this place has a few more GF dessert options than other similar places. 

I can't give it 5 stars though because it's always noisy...not in a fun, trendy restaurant way, but in a someone didn't plan the acoustics well way. Consequently the music always seems too loud. 

I'm kind of hooked on the Vietnamese Crunch Salad, and I got $100 gift card from Costco for $79.00 so I'll tolerate the noise once in a while. Just don't bring your Gramma here...she won't be able to hear anything!"}
{"text":"My go to place for healthy eats in downtown phoenix! I really need to venture out and explore other items on the menu but the \"morning riser\" with added steak is just too good to be true. This place always has incredible fresh options and it's never too busy nor too dead. It's a bit on the pricier side compared to other local options nearby, but it's worth every penny! I'll pay for healthy any day!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food with rotating lemonades to choose from.  Slightly pricier than your average fast-casual lunch spot, but it's good."}
{"text":"The food is very great and all of the workers are very nice great restaurant! I recommend the Flying Avacado and the Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Welcome finally to delicious healthy tasty food to Las Vegas. My tummy is so happy that Flower Child is finally here. Not only is their food compromised of totally super fresh ingredients that your body will love, but it's also amazingly good.  This is a must try restaurant. Once you start you won't be able to stop.  If you love FC you have to visit Toast Society Cafe. Also new to LV. Same but different...OMG!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to an extent when my girlfriend selected this place for our late and light dinner after I de-planed.  But I looked at the menu and was good with it, you gotta get the protein in!

I got the Kale salad, I don't know, but for awhile I was on a real Kale kick a couple years ago and now I'm back on it.  I added the salmon and it was very good.  I didn't go after the lemonades, but they looked inviting."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Concepts restaurant!  We stopped in this evening for an early dinner and glad we came early as this place really fills up.  The staff was so welcoming, friendly and described the menu to us in detail as we were first timers.  

The decor is beautiful...shabby chic and just pretty.  The food was delicious and healthy too.  I enjoyed a veggie plate with curried cauliflower, gluten free mac 'n cheese and sweet corn and quinoa with greek yogurt with some added salmon as my protein.  It was the perfect dinner and tons of food since I was starving!  The raspberry pomegranate lemonade was quite tasty too...fresh made and pretty tart.  


As an added bonus, I took advantage of their promotion to follow them on Instagram and save 10% on the total bill...love that!

Definitely check this great place out for a quick, healthy bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is outstanding, I've tried quite a few dishes and love them all! Especially the Skinny Cobb and the steak as a protein add on. The deserts are delicious too! Also, the staff is always all smiles, are extremely nice, and provide beyond what is expected. Can't say enough good things about FC! It's now one of my go-to spots!"}
{"text":"Had the forbidden rice with shaved steak, Mediterranean salad and side of Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were unreal! I could've eaten 3 plates by myself!!! The salad was yum and the rice dish was full of flavor! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"A rare find! Healthy, tasty and a very convenient location across Boca Park!! A perfect place to bring the kiddos. They were both super happy with their bowls and the lemonade bar!! I chose the vegan poke with tofu. Perfect for dinner on a shopping weekend evening!! Did I mention they have Kombucha on tap?  Healthy food for a Happy Family!!"}
{"text":"This was a great spot for grabbing a healthy, fresh tasting, delicious meal. On my recent visit, I had a delicious thai salad with salmon--it was really well done and deceptively large. The rest of the salads looked really great and the bowls definitely caught my eye too.

They have a nice, somewhat small, selection of wine and beer, and while I didn't try any of the teas or lemonades, the varieties looked super yummy. The atmosphere is nice--bright, airy, and trendy looking, yet comfortable enough that my friend and I felt fine hanging out for awhile to catch up.

Were I in the area again, I'd definitely make my way back!"}
{"text":"Flower Child is INCREDIBLE. I wish I could eat there every single day, I don't think I would ever get sick of it. The Flying Avocado is amazing, their brownie is incredible, and no words can be used to describe their mac and cheese. I could write good things about every menu item, there is nothing that isn't good there. It's not cheap but the food is very high quality and well worth it."}
{"text":"Eat here twice a week, so definitely a fan of the place. Typically I call in an order and it's ready within 15 minutes. There are a lot of healthy choices and the food is excellent. My only complaint is the pricing. It gets expensive quickly (one caveat is off the kids menu, excellent value there!)."}
{"text":"Pricey but the quality of the food and the portions are pretty good. Also, it is understandably pricey because you are getting vegan, gluten free, and local produce - among other things. The layout is extremely open and inviting. So far, the Mother Earth, \"Forbidden\" Rice, and Wild Mushroom Pho were amazing! I do feel like the \"Forbidden\" Rice was a little oily but it was still really good! They also had great service."}
{"text":"Flower Child is AMAZING, ORGANIC, and PRETTY!!! :)
I LOVE 2/3 meals I've gotten there. 
I found about this place 1 year ago, and I've had the Curry Bowl, Thai Cashew Bowl, and the Late Riser bowl. I've loved every bowl except the curry one.
The brownies are TOP OF THE LINE, and the lemonade is THE BEST! 
This place has either a OUT THE DOOR line or slow service though. Take your pick! :(
But, I am obsessed with Scottsdale HonorHealth Shea Hospital, and the outdoor seating has a VERY nice view of this hospital. :D I've even seen a air evac helicopter take off at the hospital from Flower Child!!! :D 

5 STARS!!! :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about this one but it was delicious!  Had the salmon with cauliflower, broccoli and mashed potatoes and everything was fabulous!  It was hot, light and so flavorful.  Loved sitting outside in the shade.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"An amazing, healthy choice for aspiring or consistent health junkies! Awesome menu full of options no matter your dietary preferences!!"}
{"text":"Finally!  A healthy alternative in my neighborhood, close to the hospital on Shea & doctor's offices, great location, lots of good choices.  Great vegetarian and vegan choices as well.  We had gluten free desert and it was to die for!  Everything was good about this place and the service was excellent.  Everyone was so helpful!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I really liked the lemonades and treat choices in the window, but I was kind of underwhelmed by my salad mostly because I thought for the price it would be bigger. The girls behind the counter were lovely, but I think the food could use some work here. I'm also giving it three stars because I actually like funky tables and chairs. I'm not sure if I'll be back to this place."}
{"text":"Every Friday, we go out for family dinner. We like to try as many new places and experiences as possible. This week Mrs. Gi suggested we try Flower Child. I knew nothing about the place but always game to try something new. When I looked at the menu and it said \"health Food\" ... I was like  ... and thought to myself, at least Portillo's is in walking distance ...

BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO SKEPTICAL. The food is actually really good! Even the kids liked it! In fact, I can't wait to go back. Everything we had was awesome! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Awesome. I had the avocado wrap so fresh and flavorful. And you must must have the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome experience...food, service and ambience all top notch. Food choices high quality, tasty and HEALTHY! Easy parking, friendly service and we spotted a celebrity."}
{"text":"If you are looking for somewhere healthy, reasonably priced, and delicious than this is the place for you! The ambience is so casual and trendy and was just an enjoyable place to sit, relax, catch up with friends, and enjoy some great food and drinks. 

Service was great! Ordered, had not a problem grabbing a table, and our food came in hardly any time at all :) definitely would recommend any of the plates or bowls! Absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy, organic, vegan choices...what's not to love! Definitely coming back! Really tasty"}
{"text":"Our neighborhood place to feed the kids.  They love the chicken and steak with rice.  Also the Mac and cheese is both tasty and healthy. Gluten free MAC that actually tastes good?   Yep!"}
{"text":"Except for the vintage blow-up photo of Twiggy and a couple of peace signs toward the back (photo: http://bit.ly/2yRnX1R), I wasn't feeling the heavy-duty hippie-dippy vibe I was expecting from a restaurant called Flower Child. I even wore my favorite Summer of Love tie-dyed t-shirt with matching love beads and headband. OK, I didn't but the Jefferson Airplane was in my head, man. Groovy. Anyway, this place is all about the organic revolution with its heavy emphasis on local sourcing. I came here on a recent business trip to Phoenix and I was trying to keep to healthy eating.

It's an order-at-the-counter type of spot with a lot of seating. The menu appears to span the globe encompassing entree salads, mix-n-match sides, protein-optional bowls, and whole grain wraps. I was intrigued by the $9 Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl because it mentioned three things I like right off the bat. Since I was going to expense it and didn't eat that much that day, I had them add salmon for an additional $7. The sum product was quite a hearty portion with the red quinoa mixed with zucchini, snap peas, onion, celery, shiitake mushrooms, jalapeño, Thai basil, and of course, cashews.

That was quite a bounty of flavor which I kicked up a notch with a liberal dousing of hot pepper sauce. But no, that wasn't enough for me as a slab of fresh salmon was piled on top of it (photo: http://bit.ly/2Cyp0Gv), and yes, it was a seaworthy piece of overkill. Tasty but I really didn't need it to complete the bowl. Meanwhile, I wet my whistle with a $3 Cranberry Pomegranate Lemonade which just hit the spot with a puckery sweetness (photo: http://bit.ly/2B6Bzwe). Free refills were a nice treat of which I took full adventage. It seemed fitting there was a lemonade stand out on the sprinkler-spritzing terrace. Peace, love, and lemonade, man, and put some flowers in your hair.

FOOD - 4 stars...plethora of fresh flavors though the salmon was too much for me
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious but not quite groovy
SERVICE - 3 stars...I ordered it, they brought it, the end
TOTAL - 4 stars...where are my love beads?"}
{"text":"This place is so cute.  The 3 star review is for a couple of very important reasons.  The quality of food deserves a 4-5 star but I just couldn't do it because of a few things.  

The price point .....very expensive ......$36 for lunch for 2.  Yep and you order at a counter. With that being said, my husband got the chicken avocado wrap ,and I the kale salad and soup.  
There was so much cabbage in my kale salad I had to pick some out.  For that price I should have picked nothing, not one thing out.  It was tasty just disappointing in the balance of ingredients.  Kale should have been dominant.  There were like 3 apple slices and 3 pieces  of grapefruit, and again a ton of red cabbage.  

We shared a cookie and 2 drinks.  Very expensive considering what we had. 

For our first visit it was great but disappointing too.  Next time I will ask for a kale salad and I mean kale ......  lighten up on the cabbage people.  

You live you learn.  

The next thing, there are no sound boards  it is LOUD!  We could barely have a conversation and parking was not ideal for how busy they were.

I wish I could have been totally positive but honesty is more important."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, my favorite is flying avocado with chicken ... love the lemon cake !!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place can potentially replace my love for vegenation. Although, this is not an all vegan spot they have plenty of vegan options! Their main categories consists of salads, plates, bowls and wraps. I ended up going with a plate that consisted of three options. The three options I picked were Indian spiced cauliflower, red chili glazed sweet potatoes and spicy jalapeño eggplant, I topped it off with tofu as my protein. To sum it all up WOW! All of the choices for my plate where amazing 5/5 stars. My sister had bird is the word and she added avocado hummus. She didn't enjoy the grilled onions in side but loved the side salad 3/5 stars. We also had a fresh brewed beverage. I tried all of them and alone non of them were really that enjoyable. However, if you make an Arnold Palmer it's ok. Finally, customer service was amazing very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Having people wait outside in the heat is bad no matter how good the food is.  Long line outside the door.  Staff super nice. Food is fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Mother Earth bowl but it is pricy for what you get and becomes even more expensive if you add meat/fish. Although it is a splurge meal, you walk away feeling full but not heavy and weighed down. The staff is friendly and Flower Child offers fruit infused water in front of the restaurant. The organic kale salad and Vegan Poke are also delicious options, but the Mother Earth bowl with steak is still my favorite.

What I recommend: 
-- Mother Earth bowl"}
{"text":"Great iced tea choices. Fresh tasting salads. There was a waiting line at Lunch during the week. The meal was overpriced.  The staff is cheerful & friendly.  Probably won't go back. Too many other good choices, here in the Valley."}
{"text":"I moved to Scottsdale recently and this was the first place that I went to. Needless to say, I'm absolutely obsessed! The food is delicious, the decor is adorable and bright, and the people are sweet and willing to work around your food allergies. I ordered the Early Riser without cheese and she asked if it was preference or allergy, meaning that they are even careful with my little lactose intolerance! As a vegan restaurant I know they must be diligent but it made me respect them even more when she asked. The Mother Earth bowl is a favorite and their hummuses are mouth watering although I'm partial to the avocado hummus. Their sides are great, heirloom tomatoes and watermelon are a must try. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I am hooked. I love their Summer Vegan salad. It is my favorite salad and I crave it almost once a week. The price is decent for vegans and vegetarians, if you want some protein it gets a little pricier. I would definitely recommend, but don't come during lunch hour, it is packed but sooooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"So excited that a Flower Child has opened up even closer to my home...I love this place!  We stopped in last night for dinner and I enjoyed a raspberry ginger lemonade and a 3 side plate that included Indian curry cauliflower, parmesan dusted broccoli and mac 'n cheese - delicious and just the right portion size!  This will definitely be a local restaurant on rotation when we are looking for good quality, somewhat healthy food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Healthy and yummy - a great combo. My wife and I both had thE Mother Earth bowl. I had steak in mine and my wife had chicken. Delish!"}
{"text":"Flower Child, where have you been all my life? I love the unique concept of this restaurant; it's something Phoenix has definitely been missing. The mix n' match is the way to go. With that option, you can pick up to three sides and a protein. The red chili glazed sweet potatoes with bok choy and sesame seeds are downright incredible. This place works great for vegetarians and omnivores alike as well. I am very certain I saw tears in my husband's eyes when he ate the grass-fed steak. Yes, this place is pricey, but when you weep over the deliciousness of the food, your wallet won't feel so bad."}
{"text":"Great food,service and the mix of flavors is great.  I love the the wraps, Mother Earth bowl and Vietnamese Crunch salad.  They need to create orders online.  Other than that is a great place to enjoy lunch or light dinner."}
{"text":"This is some of the most amazing food I have ever eaten. I love the options provided and all the ways you can vary the meals. I may be addicted to their cauliflower and have not stopped thinking about it for the last 3 days. The staff was friendly and the food was served quickly. We ate outside and it was lovely and clean."}
{"text":"Bless!!!! Haven't tried a bad thing. So happy to have vegan options by my house. Love the Thai Dye, Mother Earth, and of course the lemonades :) this place rocks!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! I come here daily. Polite staff, great atmosphere, and tasty food!

10/10 recommend if you're vegan."}
{"text":"5* today.  Lunch at 1:30 on Sunday.  3 veggie paste (Brown rice, sweet potato, asparagus) with salmon.  Fountain drink.  Ideal lunch.  $18-19.  Honestly worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious 
Reasonable 
Clean
Healthy food
Nice atmosphere 
Parking 
And AC!
Great indoor and outdoor space. 
Yummy drinks- refreshing!"}
{"text":"From the parking lot, you walk up a short flight of stairs to enter the restaurant. Some things you'll notice immediately is the outdoor seating on the deck which is something I highly recommend taking advantage of if it's nice outside. 

Upon entering, I immediately felt comfortable. Not only are the employees easily approachable but the atmosphere feels natural. The menu isn't complicated to order from and the employees have no problem making some recommendations. They have a variety of high quality teas, lemonade and ale. All ingredients used in their meals are fresh, organic, and non-GMO.

Overall this place consists of deliciousness, good vibes, friendly staff members, and a trendy setup."}
{"text":"Had the kale salad and salmon, the salad was perfectly done and the salmon was great. It's not my first time here, but I think it's safe to say that for healthy food I'd strongly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We love trying new places! Flower child has a Great open space and modern feel. 
Healthy is what they claim and success! we loved our food! However don't expect to leave feeling stuffed or full. Or there being any soda (our fav)
We feel satisfied and that's great! 
I had the mushroom Pho w/steak - great flavor! The noodles however seemed to break too easily, the steak was yummy. A little too thick but still filling overall. 
Husband had the Forbidden rice w/steak and he liked his plate as well. 
We shared the sautéed spinach & cauliflower - yummy. We'd order it again.
Our 4yo had the chicken w/broccoli & Parmesan and brown rice. Broccoli could have been a bit more tender but overall a hit.

Will we be back? Not sure. It's great, but over priced in our opinion ($50). Guess it'll depend how hungry we are."}
{"text":"I had the forbidden rice & added tofu which was delicious! I think this is a great place to come to if you are vegan & want to have several options to eat while dining with meat & dairy eaters. It is a bit expensive, but you have to remember that this is quality food. It may be priced higher than other places, but the cost is substantially lower when it comes to your health & the negative impact other places have on the environment, people, & animals. The employees were also really sweet & helpful. If available, get the pudding. It's to die for. I'll be coming back here next time I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My friend  and I weren't so impressed.  Loud music, certainly  not dinner music.
Small portions.
Spicy  sweet potatoes,  spicy hot...why?
Guess it's in now.
It's a pretty place, clean and concerned waitstaff  but we're not seeing the  value for the money, nor are we recommending or returning."}
{"text":"The absolute best place to eat. Clean, healthy, wonderful atmosphere, & great staff. I ordered the spicy eggplant & thai quinoa bowl & both were delicious, very flavorful & full of great ingredients."}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced. Their kombucha was also amazing! I suggest you ask for a sample. Looks like I won't be going to True Food anymore!"}
{"text":"I like fresh, healthy food with many veg options, however I also like value.  My wife and I ordered 3 main dishes between the two of us and it did not make for a satisfying meal, The other couple we were with were in the same boat.

I had the salmon from their hot pot section, it was poached in a spicy broth with some sweet potatoes it was good but light for $14, My wide had the veggie Pho it was nothing too special.

We also got a plate of 3 salads, The avocado and citrus was a bit too slimy, the mushrooms and asparagus were well cooked and the beet salad was decent.

The format is like a pei-wei order at the counter and take a number for you table, the menu itself shares inspiration from true foods.

If you are on a diet this may be a great option. If you are hungry or looking for value it may not be the best idea."}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch after craving something new and healthy. Flower Child makes a nice first impression - gorgeous outdoor patio, very welcoming interior. This restaurant is fast casual, so be prepared to wait in a short line to look at the menu and order before sitting.

The menu consists of a few salads, bowls, drinks, and sides. Lots of typical, trendy, \"millenial\" buzz word foods like avocado toast, quinoa, and hummus. Most items are vegetarian/vegan and then you have the option of adding a protein like salmon, grass fed beef, or tofu. I liked that the menu clearly labeled foods that were vegan and vegetarian and had the option of adding meat. I got the Vietnamese Salad, which ended up being a bit underwelming. The bulk of the salad was crunchy white cabbage strings that just arent satisfying the way greens would have been. I liked the avocado and pineapple in the salad though! 

As we were eating, I started to notice details. Every table had a bottle and a little plant (we had thistle flowers), the restaurant's token hashtag was prominelty displayed, and every corner felt \"instagramable.\" The more I looked, the more I realized this place is like a character of what they think 20-somethings want. I think they ended up trying too hard to please millennials and it just started to feel forced.

The food was decent, atmosphere is decent, it just felt too cliche for me and so we probably wont be back. Unless I need a cute avocado toast shot on my instagram."}
{"text":"Wow this was really good and great flavor.  Such a cute place hard to believe it is healthy"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the food lives up to that of the Phoenix Flower Child! Looking forward to good things here! Location - super! Good outdoor area!"}
{"text":"I recently tried this newer location of Flower Child, after having frequented the one at 44th Street and Camelback.  The food was fresh and delicious, though the portions are somewhat small for some items.  The service was friendly and fast, and we experienced no issues.  Will definitely be back to try some different items."}
{"text":"IMPRESSED BY CUSTOMER SERVICE!
Not only is the food healthy and delicious... I called in a huge last minute lunch order for my office (25 minutes later) when I got there to pick it up, it was bagged and ready to go, they even helped me out to my car! Heather (one of the managers there) gave me her contact information for any future lunch orders we have so, she can insure she has all the catering items/ food needed to complete our order. It's 2018 and I rarely ever get good customer service like that! Thank you guys for appreciating our business!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here!  I love the name, the \"Flower Child\" since I grew up in this era.  The restaurant is old school, retro, with shelves of vintage objects, industrial lighting, organic foods menu.  LOTS OF SEATING.

A picture of Twiggy is on the east wall, who was one of the 1966 fashion's,  first, super model, ever!  She was short  at 5'6\", weighed 112 pounds, but was influencing fashion, hair and makeup for generations to come.  

There is a \"peace sign\" painted over her face, which is strange and confusing,  because she was British and wasn't involved in any Viet Nam protests, like Joan Baez or Jane Fonda were.  So they should use one of their images instead, with a peace sign,  Fonda and Baez symbolized peace and protest, not Twiggy.  

In addition, a peace sign is a Missle,  encircled...a little history lesson, no extra charge.  

With that said, the food was JUST OK and very expensive.  Two wraps, a tiny plate of spinach, soup and a lemonade put me back $38!!!  Definitely not, \"1960 era prices!\" 

 We were honestly, still hungry, when we finished.. could have eaten, much more,  than I received at The Flower Child.  Bags of spinach cost 99 cents, field greens, 99 cents.  MY WRAP had some kind of turkey lunch meat in it...

Lose the tip jar, staff didn't do one thing to warrant a tip, no one came by to ask,\" how our food was\", no one got us a refill of lemonade. It is, all SELF service, So why, the exorbitant prices??  $13 For a half a wrap, for heaven's sake. 

 I got a rap, alright,  \"Baby, I got ripped...\"


My friend had half a bowl of soup and a similar half a wrap, half the size of a normal wrap, (we have bought wraps, before, at Pita Jungle, full wrap, salad and you are waited on for $10.79)

...this is outrageous pricing...we could have ordered  two meals, with salad and appetizer at Chili's for $22.  

Lesson learned, the decor is 5 star, food, service and prices 0 star.  So next time, if I ever return, I will order the cucumber mint lemonade and guzzle a few cups for $3.50 but no tiny food plates, big prices.  Remember it is 1966 inside your restaurant,  your prices should reflect that."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE Flower Child. There is nothing that I have had there that I don't like. It is great tasting, healthy food. Every single item on the menu tastes great except for the Pho. Their deserts are amazing too. This is a must try."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch and it was busy! Happy to see! I had the Thai cashew quinoa bowl and the flavor was great! Just enough of a portion too. Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Two stars for decor and location. No stars for the over-priced bland food. At least give us adult size portions. I ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad. No Bueno. It was like they opened a pre-bagged salad and served only a quarter of it on a cute plate. Except this one cost $8 instead of the $2.99 that it would've cost at the grocery store. Mostly leafy, very little chopped veggies. 
Server: \"Here's your chopped salad. Can I get you anything else?\" 
Me: \"Yes, the rest of my salad please.\" 
Server: (Staring at me blankly) (Crickets)"}
{"text":"It is a great concept and they have a lot of healthy options.  Food is very tasty and you can eat healthy as well.  I would recommend for a quick and delicious bite."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food for a reasonable price. I especially like the kale salad and the flying avocado, both with tofu. Their kombucha on tap is tasty as well."}
{"text":"Flower Child made for an overall great dining experience. The food was delicious, and definitely met my expectations. The service was very warm and friendly. I especially loved theme of nature and happiness represented in the aesthetic of the restaurant. It made for a great mood during the meal.

       When I first approached the restaurant, I found that the overall look was incredibly welcoming. The outside of the restaurant was beautifully decorated with wall art, and the cute lemonade stand right outside the door put a smile on my face. I waited in a generally short line to place my order. Placing my order was surprisingly smooth. The employee was able to take my friends order as well and my own under the same table number and at the same time. She was also still able to separate our checks. I ordered a side of their gluten free mac n cheese , their avocado/egg-white toast, as well as a drink. I was excited to try their healthy dishes. The food was a little more on the expensive side, but I hoped that the taste would make up for the emptiness in my pockets. The employee offered us our table indicator and allowed us to choose our table either inside or outside. We got our drinks from the selection of lemonades and teas. I decided on the Rose Petal Lemonade. It was delicious and I took advantage of the free refills! My friend and I decided to have a seat outside, which was nice, but the traffic on the busy street next to us was a little distracting to our conversation. Our food came out surprisingly quick, and was fantastic. The meal definitely rose above my expectations. I enjoyed the food so much, it was difficult to believe how healthy it was! The mac n cheese was great and I could tell the cheese was of high quality. The avocado toast was also really fresh and tasty. I will definitely be ordering these menu items again! My friend and I continued to enjoy the aroma of the restaurant for a short time before heading out. Overall, I really enjoyed the service, food, and setting. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time here and I like it a lot. I ordered the Madras Curry with chicken and it's great! Not as stewy as I've had in the past, and everything seems very fresh. The vibe is more for lunch than dinner, in my opinion, but it's a sweet spot nonetheless.."}
{"text":"I ate here with my kids for lunch today. While my meal (Strawberry fields with chicken) was good and my son's turkey wrap was good -and filling, my daughter's madras curry bowl couldn't have been a bigger disappointment. There were about 10 bite-sized vegetable pieces. Honestly it was a joke the amount of food in the \"bowl.\"  Maybe adding some meat would be helped but really it was just the smallest amount of food I've seen in an entree. She is not a big eater and she was hungry when we left. Disappointing for such a good restaurant. We spent $37 -no drinks-for the three of us and she and I could've have eaten much more."}
{"text":"Great review on yelp so I say why not! It didn't fail to impress, the food is clean and fresh. Took my daughter and her friends ages 17-19, they felt like a hipster:) it was a great choice to end my stay here at AZ. I'm leaving these college girls to come back here again and again;)"}
{"text":"Really fresh food that's health conscious.  The grilled chicken is excellent.  I also tried their somen salad and my wife had the mother earth bowl with salmon.  While not quite filling, I felt good after eating here.  It seems like these correct portion places are all the rage now, and this is a great addition to the hood.  I'll definitely be back for take out, and maybe next time we'll eat there and try one of the beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"Food tastes fresh, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. I recommend the salmon. Cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat all of the bowls are amazing! My two favorite sides are the gf Mac n cheese and the sweet potatoes you just can't go wrong with these items. Do yourself a favor and come eat here!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and a great value.  Food came out quickly and the staff was very attentive.  Will Donnelly recommend this place and will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Very healthy and tasty eatery in Scottsdale! Be prepared to dine in the middle of a mad rush during peak times (including servers constantly asking if you're done so they can clear the table). It loses a star because service during peak times isn't welcoming."}
{"text":"Excellent. Fresh natural ingredients. Love the forbidden rice the best. Highly recommend. Staff are first rate"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The ambience was nice and the service was friendly. We ordered take out. I got The Rebel, my husband got the Spicy Salmon Nabemono and my friend for the mix-n-match. The flavor was good. Not great but good. You can definitely taste that there are high quality ingredients used but it was nothing stellar. Now for the portion sizes. I would give that one star. All three of us joked about going out to dinner AFTER we had finished. The portion sizes are small and do not warrant the high price tag. After all My wrap plus iced tea was $17 without tax! Not something you expect to pay for a wrap a few pieces of lettuce and an iced tea.  We will not be back. We feel like FOX concepts struck out on this one. If you want great flavor, high quality and better portions do take out or eat in at True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, healthy and tasty always fresh and consistent! Great service always!"}
{"text":"Tasty little hot spot in Arcadia. This location is much better than the one in Scottsdale because it's less crowded with friendlier employees and faster service. The Rebel Wrap is my go-to favorite. Takeout service is usually quick and easy. The place is always kept nice and clean, and all the seating options are comfy. Hopefully sometime in the near future, they'll post some nutritional info so I can watch my calories more efficiently."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great service. Parking sucks sometimes, but other than that this place is always on point. Recommend the Mother Earth bowl."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great healthy food. The barley beef soup is fantastic and the harvest quinoa is the best I've ever had.
Upbeat atmosphere. Nice wait people. 
Unlimited teas and different lemonades. All delicious. 
Food is fresh and great. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent enough food, but it's expensive for what it is.  I'd rather hit up the many other local healthy eating places."}
{"text":"This will be an Arcadia staple in no time.  

Excellent, healthy food.  Tons of mix and match options.  I had the pho (and substituted chicken for tofu).  It was delicious.  Beautiful space.  Looks gorgeous inside.  Really tasty lemonade and tea made in house.  

To think that this was the Blockbuster where I rented DVDs in a time not so remote.  The world moves..."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  The vegan kale salad and hummus were amazing --- always a favorite place to come and always leave satisfied and healthy!"}
{"text":"Flower Child is my go-to spot for a healthy weekend lunch. Sometimes, it's my go to for a healthy weeknight dinner. 

PROs: You can mix and match the proteins and the different formats easily--this means you can tweak your favorites, but you don't have to. The options are good for you, but still manage to feel decadent and often the flavor combinations are exciting (I love the sweet potato-broccoli pesto combo in the Mother Earth, and the heirloom beans - greek yogurt combo in the Late Riser). The roasted brussels and chili glazed sweet potatoes are both sides worth trying. 

CONs: during rushes, the walk up and order situation is crowded and confusing and the dining room is not in the greatest of shape. Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of the whole \"order and take your number yourself to a table.\" Once, I took a number and there were no tables... Which is to say, this seems like a system ripe for poor handling. I'm sure brunch here is great, but I'm not willing to fight the crowd to try it out.

I'm also taking a star off because the $7 avocado toast is ONE slice of toast with a quarter of an avocado and ONE egg. What is this, Manhattan? There's actually a picture of it on Y and it looks much more loaded... but caveat emptor that's a trick of scale. IT'S A SMALL PIECE OF BREAD."}
{"text":"Loved my visit to Flower Child. I loved the food , so fresh , so flavorful , so healthy!  But I have to be honest, I am not going to lie.  I LOVE THE DECORATING.  Entering the restaurant , I was transported to a big city with a hip local joint where all the cool kids go to eat. Now when I looked around it was a lot of Mature Mamas like me, but let's pretend the cool kids were there.
The  name Flower Child first invoked a hippie vibe but this was beyond hippie.  Loved the vintage , garden, uptown feel , with open spaces, peace sign mural and unisex bathrooms. 
I can't wait to go back. The egg quinoa bowl I had was super tasty and not what I expected. 
I haven't had a love affair with quinoa like some have had so I wasn't sure it was my cup of tea. But I was ready to lick the bowl with its tangy richness. What an unexpected pleasure.
Flower Child please open up a franchise in the Northwest Valley and I promise to be your Hippie Chick forever."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place by accident. Glad we did!
Fast, clean, reasonable, healthy--& surprisingly tasty! 
Avocado hummus with veggies is a great quick starter, and we loved both of our main entrees: Organic kale salad with chicken, and the Vietnamese crunch salad with salmon. Even the side dishes we ordered were exceptional--Butternut squash, & Sweet chili sweet potato.
Everything is prepared with style, flair and a healthy dose of creativity. Didn't find a bad dish in the place!
We went all out and tried lots of stuff, but a full, healthy tasty meal can be had for about $20 something. 
We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I've had a positive experience recently at a sister restaurant called Doughbird. Since I was nearby and like the menu for Flower Child I thought I'd finally give them a try.

Flower Child is a casual health focused restaurant. They serve a variety of local produce in choices of salads, vegetable plates, bowls, wraps and more. There are add on Protein Options where meats are naturally raised and the Tofu is organic non-gmo.

There is a menu posted at the entrance and you order at the counter, grab a number, get your beverage and seat yourself in the comfortable farmhouse style dining room or the attractive patio.

I ordered the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl with added Salmon ($16.) I note I do have a peeve when I go to restaurants when I don't get what was promised on the menu.....My bowl was missing three ingredients that were necessary for flavor. My bowl was missing the Thai Basil, Jalapeños and the Shiitake Mushrooms. My salmon was cooked reasonably well and it was a nice portion but I felt cheated since three ingredients were missing. My bowl was ok at best but tasted bland.

My husband tried the Grass Fed Steak Wrap called Rebel Wrap. ($13.) He said the wrap had very good flavors but the steak inside was very sparse and was chewy. He didn't care for the salad that was served on the side because it just tasted like it was just oil.

The Mix and Match Vegetable Plates sound amazing so we decided to share and try three vegetables.

Our favorite Vegetable that we tried the the Spicy Japanese Eggplant. It wasn't spicy but had tasty flavors and didn't seem oily like Asian Eggplant often is. Our least favorite vegetable was the Indian Spiced Cauliflower. It was mildly seasoned and seemed slightly Indian Style but what we didn't like most was the texture of the cauliflower. It was browned but was dry and sort of raw like.

On my way out someone asked me how things were. I did tell them about the missing ingredients from my bowl and they said that they were sorry and I left.

3 missing ingredients from my meal
scant amount of chewy steak in wrap
Order at the counter - Sit down service and priced type food.

The food in general was ok at best
(OK on Yelp - 3 stars)
But I don't believe it is ok to leave out three ingredients from something you order so I must award 2 stars.

I do figure my visit was an off day and normally they do things better but this is how it was on my visit."}
{"text":"1/20/17
I had the skinny Cobb salad with chicken. It was just OK for a $15 salad (I'm rounding up)! Would I get it again....NO!! I was disappointed...no where online in the list of ingredients does it list \"mixed spring greens\" and that is what I received with some romaine thrown in. 
The ingredients were fresh, but definitely not worth what I paid!"}
{"text":"We tried the flower child the other evening. It was great. Dined on the patio it was a nice evening we tried the avocado toast it was one of the best I have had. I had the forbidden rice with shaved beef delicious. My friend had the Mother Earth   Also tried rose petal lemonade. Food is served hot have to go boxes available. Very energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"In my most humble opinion, I dig Flower Child. I was just there and had the Flying Avocado Wrap and a large Peach Lemonade. Reasons why I dig....
·         The atmosphere is inviting
·         The staff are pleasant
·         The drink options are FANTASTIC
·         Their 44th and Camelback locale is in a great spot for shopping too
·         And the last and most important (to me) reason why I can without a shadow of a doubt say I heart Flower Child - they donated to my cause

I realize for most this may sound dumb, but it can be extremely daunting and hard to get donations from bigger business restaurants like these and FC made it incredibly pleasant and easy. Because of their generosity they now have great advertising giving their brand a soft side.
Thank you Flower Child - my heart and belly are very pleased."}
{"text":"Upon entering, you order at the front, in what they term a fast casual dinning style, are given a number, and take a seat...easy, right? Flower Child is quite airy and pretty inside, and the patio setting outside is attractive as well.

Five of us ordered:
 - Chicken with Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Gluten-free Mac & Cheese, and Smashed Organic Potato.
 - Chicken with Clementine & Organic Apple and Sautéed Spinach
 - Thai Dye Wrap
 - Flying Avocado Wrap
 - Thai Cashew Quinoa with Salmon

We liked it so much that we came back for:
- Forbidden Rice Bowl
- Mother Earth Bowl

Flower Child serves healthy, simple, clean food...one might have thought the flavor to be simple as well...CERTAINLY NOT!!! Especially the Quinoa in the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl that I shared with my love...it is so good that I almost snuck into the back of the house to try and get the recipe. The salmon was cooked perfect. The Thai Dye was wrapped in a house made, whole wheat, flax & chia seed wrap that was warm and soft. Inside the wrap, the main protein is spicy tofu...spicy enough to notice the spice, but not so much to overpower the taste of all the vegetables inside of the wrap.   

There is a self serve drink station with some of the usual suspects as well as a couple of lightly flavored lemonades that our girls enjoyed. Napkins, utensils, togo boxes, and bags are all organized right next to drink station...so if you need a box to go for the left over, just go grab it.  

Unlike another health-oriented restaurant located across the street, FC's food has a decently good portion for the price...and it is so flavorful! They use local produce and Gluten light ingredients...but you can have many options as gluten free as well, though sometimes for an extra charge in the case of  the gluten free pita for $1.50. Their protein choices are all natural chicken, sustainable Salmon, grass-fed Steak (they serve medium), and organic non-GMO Tofu.  

Flower Child is a popular spot right now for good reasons. Make a point to stop by if you haven't already done so.

{"text":"I lived in San Diego for a bit and absolutely loved Tender Greens and Urban Plates. 

Flower Child totally is the Vegas equivalent! The steak was extremely tender! And my Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were perfect sides! The size portion was perfect. Had the Vegan chocolate pudding and that was super! The teas were refreshing. Prosecco was amazing and the lager beer was delicious!

Atmosphere was clean and fresh! 

Definitely recommend this place! 

Cannot wait to go back and try some other stuff off the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute. It is very spacious and has great ambiance. You can sit either indoors or outdoors whichever you prefer and our food was out pretty fast. I enjoyed their steak as well as their green beans along with a glass of Prosecco. The customer service was great as well. The vibe is very chill and is a great place to have a family gathering. I will most likely return here for future brunches and just meeting up with my girls."}
{"text":"First time here, my wrap and lemonade were delicious!! The prices are a bit high but for the quality of food that they offer here it is so worth it. I got the Hippie Chick Wrap it was extraordinary!"}
{"text":"Best location, best service!!! Absolutely obsessed with the food and the employees are always so great! Special thanks to Cole for always being so helpful & attentive!"}
{"text":"Oh my. The ambience, the quality and creativity of the food, the friendly staff, and all for reasonable prices. I'm 110% in love with this place!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were just too high coming in.  My co-worker said it was delicious so I had to try it.  I really love beet salads right now so I had to try it.  It is $7 for to side dishes.  I ordered the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad and the beet salad.  It just wasn't anything special at all and it was also small.  I really was disappointed.  And I waited forever to get my food to go.  Really?"}
{"text":"Flower Child is the perfect healthy and funky design place in all of Phoenix. The nice employees and great culture makes you almost not want to leave. 

We went once for lunch and another day for dinner, although the menu options are the same, there are plenty to choose from and the opportunity to mix it up!

Unfortunately, our little one had a small allergic reaction to something in an option. They were amazing about it and had her leave happier than when we walked in. 

I'm so happy we found this place and got to eat two times before leaving Phoenix. It is a must-try for anyone and everyone who has one nearby them, particularly this one! Keep it up, Flower Child!"}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite restaurant in the area, being from California I didn't want to go to some boring chain restaurant that I can go to everywhere else. The line was pretty long and I didn't know what to expect since all of the food is organic and sounded like nasty rabbit food. The line moved slow enough for us to decide what to order (give or take 10 min.) and we were given a table number and fresh blueberry lemonade while we waited. 
The prices are a little high, but the quality is worth it. We ended up getting the forbidden rice bowl, the rebel wrap (sub horseradish for avocado hummus), and the free bird wrap. I tasted a little of my families food, both of which were great, but I will be back and the rebel wrap will most definitely be my regular. Also, you can't go wrong with any of the teas or lemonades. But don't forget to put sugar in them!!

One thing that I did not like is that it was too noisy. I prefer eating at a place that doesn't have the music blaring (and I'm barely 26)."}
{"text":"I usually stop by and order take out whenever I'm in the area. Staff is very friendly and helpful with explaining different menu items. At my most recent visit, I ordered the Heirloom Bean \"Burrito\" Bowl. I had to ask what was included since the description was somewhat confusing. The bowl was delicious and had a nice kick to it. Very fresh ingredients were used as well. Food comes fairly quickly and I never have to wait too long for my orders. Overall, this place offers many fresh and healthy options! My only issue with this place is  that they seem to change the menu often. Thus, the menu item I had ordered previously (and thoroughly enjoyed) is no longer available...but I can usually find another great item to replace it!"}
{"text":"Good sized portions. Way overpriced. Confusing ordering process. Not my kind of place, but some of you hippie folk will love it."}
{"text":"Delicious clean food, friendly service - something for everyone. I felt confident that my non-veg family members (who hate kale so much they wipe it off of their tongues if they get a bit) would find something that they enjoyed - and they did. It's nice to find a place to eat out to please every type of eater. I'm always trying to get my extended family members to eat better and this is one way to eat a meal out together. Terrific flavors, tons of options, and totally \"Instagrammable\" decor that is sure to inspire."}
{"text":"This place was so cute! Definitely hippie/hipster vibe from this place. There's in door and outdoor seating. My friend is vegan is wanted to try this so I said sure. I'm into healthy fun and I know vegan food is healthy and yummy from the looks of it. So you walk in and you order what you want and they give you a number. My friend and I decided to sit outside. The nice thing about this was there's a little table with cups and a water jug thing with lemon in it. So nice. Otherwise you can get your own drink inside. Her and I both got the mother bowl. It has quinoa, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, kale, and caramelized onions. It was so yummy, light, and the PERFECT combination. Seriously. I definitely will be back to have that or something else. And if I remember correctly you could add meat to that, so if you're not vegan like me, you can add it if you want. I chose not to. But I was definitely very impressed and so was my friend! Can't wait to come back and try more! :)"}
{"text":"The line may turn you away at first but give it a chance. We ate here twice in 3 days while in from out of town. We were in line for 15 minutes the first time and 30 minutes the second. The wait is so worth it! **They have a separate line if you're picking up or carrying out too**
While in line an employee will come up and ask where you'd like to sit (inside/outside). They will assign you a table number and go save you a table so there's no searching for one after you order. I love this idea as it guarantees you a spot and keeps everything moving quickly. 
I got the Soba Noodle Salad with Tofu and the Tomatoes and Watermelon with basaltic drizzle. The salad had a hint of heat and was delicious. The tomatoes and watermelon is something I could everyday of summer. Very light and crisp. 
My husband got the Quinoa Bowl and he \"freaking loved it!\". He also got the sweet Chili Glazed Sweet Potatoes. It was slightly spicy and very good. 
We also got the vegan cheesecake and it was one of the best vegan deserts I've ever had. It was perfect for two people to share after lunch and still left us light and not weighed down like traditional cheesecake can do. 
The teas they offer are delicious as was the sparkling kombucha. 
The staff was so friendly and helpful. You can tell they all love to work there."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious!! Cute restaurant. Great place for lunch. Friendly Staff."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Arcadia location but this one is closer to my house. I love their kids menu and kombucha on tap. One of our families go to places,
This location however has poor quality food. I order the same thing every time, and this time my salad was not right. Presentation looked like it was thrown in the bowl. There was lettuce that was not even chopped fully and the tofu was not marinated or barely grilled. Hopefully next time it is better."}
{"text":"Best salad in Phx. Perfect every time with extra crisp lettuce and fresh veggies. This place is my current favorite restaurant in the whole of phx!"}
{"text":"I was looking for fresh and healthy food and this place for the bill.  I went two nights in a row while in Scottsdale on business and was happy with my choices both times."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite place! Super cute decor, fast service and amazing food!! I ate there multiple times on my trip to AZ! Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The menu always scares me a little because I worry the combination I read will not be palatable..but it always exceeds my expectations! Like mom says--- don't knock it 'till you try it!"}
{"text":"OMG- SO good! Just tried this wonderful new place in Scottsdale and it is SOOOooo good!
I love the Vintage touches to the décor. And tho it was busy and the line  to order was long, it still works, with easy ordering and an easy sit-down. They are very smart to find tables for you while you are on line to order & then reserve that empty table for you with a table number sign. SO after you order, you sit immediately and have your order brought to you. Again, so smart! Other places should take note.
And the food was GREAT! I ordered 3 sides for $9- delish mac n cheese (gluten free), the Indian spiced cauliflower and a fantastic golden beet & avocado salad with citrus dressing- so good! And the 3 sides made a full meal at a great price. Ask for the free Pita bread too. Lots of other choices- salads, wraps & bowls that are all veggie & grain oriented but you can add a choice of proteins (including salmon!) and tofu for an extra charge. Very veg & vegan friendly. I am totally going back soon. And I'd like to try to original Flower Child on 44th St & Camelback."}
{"text":"Flower child, please come to Houston, TX! I love this restaurant and the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant. It's very zen and the menu is wholesome and organic. You wait in line and order at the counter before sitting down. 

Kombucha on tap for $5 is a bit pricey especially in the size cup it comes in. 

My friends and I ordered the mother earth bowl with chicken, sweet corn and quinoa children's meal, brussel sprouts and roasted cauliflower as sides and the rebel wrap. 

The mother earth bowl comes with ancient grains, sweet potato, portobello mushroom, avocado, cucumber, broccoli pesto, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, hemp seed. The chicken was very bland so I wouldn't say it was worth the $5. It's probably slices half the size of a small chicken breast. I liked the sweet potatoes and all the flavors and texture of this bowl. It was quite filling. 

The rebel wrap comes with grass-fed steak, charred onion, port salut cheese, horseradish yogurt, arugula. This wasn't as filling as it did not come with any sides. It was an OK wrap. The steak portion was small. 

Surprisingly the sweet corn and quinoa was good. I'm not a huge fan of corn but the subtle sweetness got me coming back for more. 

I wish the portion for the sides was more substantial. For the price I would have expected it to be. However both were flavorful and we enjoyed them. A bit strong on the curry of the cauliflower but our favorite was the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite healthy restaurant! The flying avocado or the forbidden rice with chicken are my go to always. Never disappoints! Super cute decor is always a plus."}
{"text":"First let me say I really like the decor and the concept. The location is ideal as well. Dining in has never been too much of an issue. The price for what you get can be a little high...which isn't surprising. The mark up on healthy trendy food is actually really sad...  but this review is more about the take out and service.

We have ordered take out twice. Once we got the curried quinoa bowl and the second time each of us got the Mother Earth bowl. Both times portions were much smaller than what you get when you dine in. Presentation is pretty awful and unappetizing as well. My bowl was missing the pesto which is a staple in the dish. I called to see if I could possibly come back and the response that I received was a bit scary. \"I'm not sure what you would like me to do? I can talk to a manager but I don't think we can take it back.\" I literally hung up the phone in disbelief. Who says that to a paying customer? Will I ever come back? Possibly to dine in, but their food isn't difficult to make at home. I am highly against ordering take out from this place. I'd rather eat a kashi quinoa bowl than the slop they throw in a container and make look like dog food, honestly."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but if our looking for a clean meal, this is the place.  Great food awesome vibes and friendly service.  We got be Mother Earth and the rice bowl, very satisfying.   

Namaste"}
{"text":"The wait was out of this world but the speed that they got to us was incredible. It is in a great location and is a really nice place. The reason for me that it's not 5 stars is because it just did not stand out to me for the price of the food. I would still recommend it to anyone in the area though. It is super clean eating. I got the vegetarian salad and added salmon/ chicken. The spicy eggplant was amazing."}
{"text":"The only reason i dont give this place 5 stars is the price. healthy food is very important to me and if its veggie even better. the took the local drinks and the mother heath i think dish. 

it was good and it was very healthy. i felt good after eating this lunch and will get back to this place again i hope"}
{"text":"Came RIGHT before close. The cashier was super friendly and made sure I didn't feel pressured to take my order to go even when I offered. Wild mushroom pho with grass fed beef added. OUTSTANDING. I will return to try more creations!"}
{"text":"Originally I rated this place as 3 stars because of an issue with our to-go food and an unapologetic staff. However, within one day of posting that review, the manager contacted me to apologize for the experience and ask for a re-do. I appreciate her reaching out and making an effort to make amends. She offered us free meals, but we went in again on our own to get an authentic experience. As always, the food was delicious. We got our food quickly, and everyone's meal was as expected. 



My brother called in to order 3 meals for pick up on our way home from toddler gym class. When we got there, they somehow had sold our order to someone else. The cashier apologized, but insisted the person who bought it said my brother's name as his pickup name--hmmm. 

They said it would be 5-10 minutes to cook the order. After we waited a bit longer than ten minutes (with a fussy toddler), they gave my brother the food. I figured they would at least offer a discount if not give the meals for free, but instead they threw in ONE free $3 brownie, when we had clearly ordered 3 separate meals. They were only mildly apologetic and just didn't seem to really care. It was disappointing. 

That being said, the food (Thai bowl with chicken, curry bowl with chicken, and a wrap) was seriously delicious. I'll definitely come back since the food was really good, and I hope to be able to add some stars for great customer service."}
{"text":"Yes, Sam Fox and his quest to be everything to everyone.  His knowledge of trends, design acumen, and flawless execution make him the slickest restauranteur this side of Bobby Flay. 

It is in that context that this place totally belies its intended aim. It portrays itself as an altruistic hippy enclave full of good vibrations, peace, and simple whole grown fare.  What you get is tawdry gossip from the 'Village' ladies, $17 protein bowls, and a spot that is capitalizing on the latest trend.

Don't get me wrong.  My meal was tasty.  But at that price and with that atmosphere I would just assume eat a similar meal at a place like Chop Shop and donate the difference to the Peoples Republic of Sustainable Nicaraguan Coffee Growers or whatever the Whole Foods Crowd cause is at the moment."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place, wonderful atmosphere and vibe, all employees are friendly and inviting, and the food is fresh, and all natural. The gluten free Mac and cheese is a bonus too! Salmon also is great. 

On my top list of favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler so I really don't get to dine out in Paradise Valley often.  I had to run some errands yesterday in that area and decided to grab a bite (dinner).  I was very pleasantly surprised: happy and super friendly staff, amazing-tasting food, very clean and just.... just how all places should be - serving healthy food!  I'm vegan so when I came to the counter I did tell the girl \"this is my first time, aka please help me order\".  She was sooo nice and suggested the best vegan bowl and even picked out the best kids meal for my 2-year old toddler.  The girls working there right away brought us a high chair, even got us some silverware which I was supposed to get myself, but spaced it lol.  I highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"My doctor put me on a food elimination diet and this is one of the few places I can safely eat out. There are gluten and dairy free options, as well as vegan. Everything is delish, especially the Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl with salmon. It's a bit more expensive than other places but well worth it for the quality and excellent food preparation."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here today. I got Vegan Poke and it was such a light and flavorful dish. The cashier was very attentive and kind, and the place itself is super cute. I love how they have so many healthy vegan options. Definitely will try more!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with colleagues here today and I just had to write a review about this place. One word, phenomenal. Ambiance, phenomenal. Food, phenomenal. Service, phenomenal. This place gets REALLY packed during lunch time. Not sure if they do reservations, I would call and check to see if they do so that you're not waiting in the line that they have out the door during lunch time. It's well worth the wait though. They make vegan, vegetarian food so fun and flavorful. If you bring your non-vegan/vegetarian friends to dine with you they'll all find SOMETHING they like. I love the variety of the menu.

I ordered the forbidden rice plate with chicken. Omgsh. Delicious. It was my first time dining here and I can't wait to go back.

Oh, and make sure to grab one of their vegan brownies for your desert. Thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Sam Fox is a big name in the restaurant world here in the Valley of The Sun. I have been a big fan of his big name locations (Culinary Dropout, The Arrogant butcher, the Henry) and even worked at one of his locations as a food runner/ Barback. Each location, no matter the restaurant, has its own feel to it. Each different from one another.. So I had high hopes for Flower Child. Not only has it been listed as an up and coming restaurant, Fox has mastered the Trendy/healthy vibe: atmosphere we find in Flower Child. Unfortunately, this place was a little too trendy for my liking. 

From the moment we walked in, We got the impression we weren't cool enough to be there., we still needed a moment to look through the menu. The glaring continued the entire time. 

Our first impression of the cashier was friendly. He politely asked if there was anything he could help with and we told him no. He then told us he had fi run to the back to grab something and when he came back it was a completely different scenario. His personality changed. Almost as if he was suddenly counting down the minutes he had left to work. Did not seem happy at all. We placed our order and found a table. 

I ordered the protein bowl and my girlfriend ordered a wrap. For dessert we ordered a big chocolate chip cookie which was probably the best part of the entire meal. The protein bowl was good. I was under the impression it was a rice bowl. It wasn't. It had quinoa and some other grainy replacement. If I was into that type of cuisine I probably would have liked it more. But I didn't know what I was eating snd didn't get much assistance as to what we could order. It was clear that we didn't know what were were doing. Some direction in a situation like that helps. \"You guys look a little lost, any questions?\" Or \"have you been here before? Awesome! Welcome! Most newbies Grab this....\" something. Anything would have been nice. But because we were clueless and had no preference, we each picked an item at random. As we walked to  our table, the line cooks continued to glare as if they hadn't seen anyone walk through the doors in hours. It was weird. I would have to say the service was just off. The entire time we felt like we're being Judged from the moment we walked in. As I said,  I used to work in the industry and my girl still does. Whether you're in the industry or not, it's not polite to stare. Weird vibes. Good food. Good menu. Bad service. Arrogant and pompous. We likely won't be back to this location until we're cool enough to know the difference between quinoa and cous cous"}
{"text":"Love this place.   I'll be stopping in again today for avocado hummus and one of their many delicious bowls.  If you get the Mother Earth ask for extra sauce. I think it's a red pepper sauce and it's phenomenal.  The lady loves to get a turkey wrap with avocado and she's definitely picky. It's says a lot about their food and drink.  Plenty of killer desserts for us fat kids and I'm a professional lemonade mystery taste tester and their's passed the test.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get lunch! Always feel full and satisfied and don't have to sacrifice taste for healthy food. The gluten free mac is amazing and I'm not even gluten free. The Brussels sprouts have a unique flavor that is super tasty. I normally get those with steak or salmon. Sooo yummy. The house lemonades are also super tasty. The interior is bright and open."}
{"text":"Spectacular. Had the earth mother bowl w chicken.Kombucha on tap is the best I've had on tap. Beautiful space, really open & eclectic. I'm so happy it's right by my house & I can go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch.  I had the wild mushroom pho.  I thought it was fantastic.  This restaurant is has great employees who are always washing their hands and cleaning.  I love that.  They obviously take pride in their jobs.  The restrooms also are immaculate!  So clean you could eat off the floor.   They have wonderful ice tea and lemonades.  Go here and enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, but this one I just can't get behind. Exceptionally overpriced and very very bland food."}
{"text":"I really like this place for quick and easy healthier eats.  The prices are reasonable and the menu options are fun.  Try the different flavored teas- you might be as surprised as I was."}
{"text":"Deliciously heathy food - nice portions, reasonable prices - in a beautiful atmosphere with warm, friendly service...eat here!  Order at the counter, plunk your number on a table, and a delcious meal will come to you!

This Fox concept is most similar to True Food - the same level of healthy (great ingredients, great taste) with a simpler menu at lower prices.  The charming open layout is also reminiscent of True Food but cuter and more casual.  Even the bathrooms are beautiful - stainless steel and art deco.

But let's cut to the chase: the yummy food.  The menu boasts a wonderful selection of sides and proteins, which you can mix and match.  There are also plenty of salads, wraps and appetizers. It took us ages to order with all of the excellent choices.

Our food was delicious!!  I had Salmon with Organic Smashed Potatoes and Heirloom Tomatoes - the potatoes were magically creamy and flavorful (order this!) and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe.  The generous portion of salmon was tasty - cooked nicely.   I stole a bite of my husband's Thai Dye Wrap, and it had great flavor - even the actual wrap tasted good!

The desserts are all gluten free - we took a couple of rice krispie treat bars to go, and found them to be a tasty movie treat, later on."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat, hands down, I come here at least 3x a week. The food, atmosphere, staff, and service is nothing short of amazing! Such a great place to dine out and not have to to worry about finding a healthy option , because everything is healthy and delicious. Their iced tea and lemonade are to die for, and their late riser bowl is everything!"}
{"text":"I really used to like Flower Child a lot! Lots of different fresh, healthy options.
During my last visit I realized they got rid of my favorite item: the hippie chick wrap.
I tried the turkey wrap in place of it. It tasted pretty salty.

Lunch was also $45 for 2 of us. Kinda pricey!"}
{"text":"If you are vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free you will love the menu.  If you want meat, it will double the cost of your meal.  However, the service is great and the look of the restaurant is very inviting."}
{"text":"Eating healthy never has to be done begrudgingly when it comes to Flower Child. Deliciously flavorful food coupled with the cute, casual ambiance makes this place an awesome experience. I ordered the Mother Earth and it exceeded my expectations. My friends seemed to be just as happy with their orders as well. The staff was also attentive and even suggested places for my friends and me to visit since they noticed that we're from out of town."}
{"text":"Small portion!!! 
I love the concept of this place. 
Food all looked excellent & fresh. 
I ordered the Mediterranean with all natural chicken. Paid in total over $14,- for this and received a tiny portion. The salad was good but not worth 14 dollars. 
I was disappointed by the size of the portion."}
{"text":"We enjoy Flowerchild and have been to this 
concept several times. Our most recent visit
was Saturday, January 5. Everything was good
in terms of food quality though the prices have
far exceeded the value lately. When food gets
pricy the guest tends to strengthen their standards
for quality, presentation, service levels and of
course value. Flowerchild offers small portions
and although the flavors are amazing there just
isn't enough food. We had a salad, appetizer and
two lemonades for $37. No bread or anything
unique to accommodate the salad, really? I
realize Fox doesn't want to do a \"me too\"
concept though I left hungry for the second time
recently and this time it is firmly planted in my
memory to avoid such experiences. Many 
concepts have caught up with this one and offer
more unique offerings along with a bit more
portion and value for money spent. There
appears to be a lack of management as
well as it would be nice to see a manager visibly
available and attentive to show appreciation
to guests like myself and my family."}
{"text":"Spoons full of goodness, forks digging into nothing but deliciousness, and knives cutting into wholesomeness. And all this on your plate, all at once. Flower child is food perfection."}
{"text":"Expensive!  Still very tasty!  Wish they opened at 10am instead of 11am!  Also, wish they had buy 10 cold-pressed juices get one free!  Like I said though, still delicious!"}
{"text":"Whenever we visit Arizona, it seems as though there is a new restaurant added to the Fox Restaurant family. This visit, we went to Flower Child several times. It's a healthy, fast food concept. You order and pay, they give you a number, and then bring your food to you. The menu has a lot of veggie, vegan, and gluten free options. And the place is seemingly never not crowded. Seriously. 
I tried a bunch of the sides, all of which were tasty. I'm assuming that the sides vary by season, but the standouts for me were the brusseI sprouts and the indian spiced cauliflower. I also tried the thai cashew quinoa bowl which was a really large portion and had good flavor. 
I can see why this restaurant is so popular-it's a good, healthy choice for eating out."}
{"text":"The food is good, everything I've had, I've liked. My only point about this restaurant is that it clearly is the loudest room in the valley. I'm no acoustics major, but this room is loud. The background music they chose to play today, really loud screeching guitar music from who knows what band. Genius."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and while there was a line out the door, it goes relatively quickly.  I had the chopped vegetable salad with tofu added ($4 to add tofu, $7 to add salmon, and similar prices to add chicken or steak) and everything was incredibly fresh and delicious.  The dressing was fantastic, and the avocado really added a lovely creamy texture to a delicious, crunchy salad.  I just wish that it wasn't so expensive, because then I could justify going all of the time, but paying $11 for a salad just doesn't feel right.  When you think about all of the ingredients being incredibly fresh and organic (I think) it justifies it more.  While I will most definitely be back to try more dishes, I won't be making it a habit just because it would be an expensive one.  Definitely worth a try due to all of the unique, healthy, and delicious choices Flower Child offers."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the seal salad. I am not sure what kind of dressing they use but it's delicious. It gets really busy during lunch time 11-1pm so call in your order or be prepared to wait. It does go by fast."}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled that this location exists! Sometimes I don't want to drive all the way to 44th Street and Camelback to eat here so this location along the 101 and Shea makes me happy!

This whole healthy food craze is driving me nuts with the special juices and organic everything, but the food here has won me over. Food can be healthy and still taste great! How cliché does that sound?

I haven't been here in awhile so I ordered the quinoa salad and added salmon. The quinoa salad may sound boring but it's not. It's full of flavor on its own even without the salmon added. It had colorful beets in it as well as well broccoli. The chia seed vinaigrette was a unique touch along with the pistachios and manchego cheese! The salmon added was tender, flaky, and not overdone. That's hard to achieve when food is brought out impressively quickly during lunch rush hour.  I'm definitely still a fan! Is it too much to ask for one on the west side of the valley?!?"}
{"text":"Flower Child never disappoints. Everything always tastes fresh and delicious, the ambiance is inviting and the staff is always friendly. I eat here at least once a week and can't get enough!"}
{"text":"The General manager reached out to me same day on this review. I give them high marks on service and decor. I suspect they value issue will be sorted out. Give them a try!

Original post:

\"Solid food quality but poor value. I spent $13 on a 4oz (probably 3oz) piece of salmon, 4oz of organic brown rice, and 3 cubes of watermelon with 1/8 of an heirloom tomato. That's 260 calories if I'm being generous. Compared to the hot food bar at Whole Foods $7.99 a pound this works out to $20.80 a pound. Yikes!\""}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite new restaurants!
All organic,and there are vegan and gluten free options
The food is really delicious. I really enjoyed the kale grapefruit salad with chicken. The place has a happy and upbeat vibe and a decent sized patio. I always eat outside if at all possible, so that is a big plus. You order your meal up front and are given a number and its self seating, the last time I visited someone did help me find a table outside. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Every time I have visited the place has been pretty busy
Really happy they closed Applebee's and opened this in that space"}
{"text":"Yum! I'm thrilled that there's a new place in town with a bunch of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options!  A friend took me here recently for a late birthday dinner.  I think its pretty cool that you can make a meal of sides, so that's what I did!   I had the heirloom tomatoes, spicy glazed & roasted sweet potatoes, and the quinoa tabbouleh... All three for $10!  You can also add a protein to your meal such as chicken, beef, tofu, or salmon, but I didn't this trip.   I was craving quinoa, and theirs was good!  I would've like some cucumber and/or tomato in there, but it was super tasty and refreshing as it was.  The heirloom tomatoes were just about heaven...  Drizzled with just a hint of good EVOO and reduced balsamic, and sprinkled with flaked sea salt... My mouth is watering just thinking of it.  And then there are the sweet potatoes.  Perfectly roasted with a sweet chile glaze, chopped bok choy and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Dee-Lish!  They also have a cucumber mint lemonade that smelled amazing, so I may have to try that next time.  I must note that currently all of Flower Child's desserts are gluten free, but not vegan.  One of the hostesses informed me that they used to have vegan options, and would soon be bringing them back!  Until then, Flower Child... until then."}
{"text":"Great quick healthy food --- salads that also leave you satisfied unlike many other salads that you may still be hungry after eating! We had the chopped veggie salad (which was perfect) and the quinoa salad, also good-- but we lke the chopped veggie better. 
Pomo pear lemonade was tasty too. 
Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"What a fun and fresh place to dine! Casual with quality ingredients and a reasonable price point. I love the side plates options so you can mix and match your veggies. There is a plethora of gluten free and vegan options, along with yummy grass-feed beef for my fellow carnivores."}
{"text":"I think the food here is okay.  Nothing special.  A little bland on taste to be honest.  I ordered the forbidden rice bowl with steak.  It tasted like a very mild flavored teriyaki bowl.  The steak was very mild in flavor as well.  The service was good.  Nice cashier and help staff.

The food above seemed decently healthy.

The coconut juice from the coconut they opened was rather bland too.  I remember going to Hawaii and drinking the juice from the fresh coconuts there and that was an awesome experience.  The coconut juice here tasted like crap."}
{"text":"One of my photographs is on the wall as a mural toward the back of the restaurant so I went to have a look in person. Great food and atmosphere! I think I had some kind of salmon dish when I was there and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Calories don't exist here. Ok yes they do, but if I were to guess, I'd say that they are much more minimal than other restaurants! Everything here tastes fresh and healthy. Popular during the lunch hour, this shop knows how to serve food efficiently to large groups. You order at the counter, get a drink and then take a seat at a table to wait for a server to bring your food. You can also order takeout and wait at the counter. Food comes out within 10 minutes max, even on a busy day! 

The staff here is always friendly and cold water welcomes the guest upon arrival. For food, I've now ordered four things off the menu. I've ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken, the hummus starter, the Crudite and most recently, the Flying Avocado wrap. Everything I've had here has been spot on, but my favorite thing so far is the Flying Avocado wrap. It comes with chicken, avocado hummus, gouda (but I left that out), lettuce and tomato. Each ingredient complimented the other and I especially liked the kick of the avocado hummus. I gobbled up each bite. The wrap comes with a salad but the salad doesn't have anything on it, so the side lacks. If you want more than just the wrap, I suggest substituting the side with something else or getting a starter. They also have excellent lemonade and tea, but don't expect to get a soda!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy a Flower Child opened up closer to my hood! Now this is something important to note about Flower Child, True Food and any other FRCs. This isn't low cal food, this is healthy living food. There is a big difference. If you're counting calories and think you'll save a few here, you'll be disappointed. If you like to eat in cohesion with a healthy lifestyle, this is your place. Their ingredients are fresh and the best quality. The ingredients are rich in vitamins and everything that is good for your body. My two favorite items on the menu are the flying avocado wrap and the curry, yes the curry! Sam Fox does an amazing curry and I don't know how he does it (I like the one from True Food too). This Flower Child has a great grab and go section and their takeout is always spot on. I also enjoy their to go parking right in front. I enter through the to go door, pay and take my food. I'm in and out stat, which is good that they have it perfected since a hospital is across the street. My weakness? Their olive oil lemon cake. I can never seem to resist."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best health food I've tried! All the dishes I've tried have a lot of flavor. They have several teas and lemonades which are nice to sample but the flavors are a little strange for me- I think they had honey pear vanilla lemonade or something like that. But their mango green tea is awesome. They have ample seating inside but it gets crowded at lunch. The outdoor patio has a trendy feel"}
{"text":"Organic healthy food and great juice options but long lines that go outside in the heat and on the pricier side"}
{"text":"The food is good here. The price points, hard to navigate menu, chaos of trying to find a table and parking brings this down a star for me. A plus for me is this was a good place to take my kid, but make sure to bring someone to get a table while you order. It's a louder atmosphere so baby crying gets drowned out. It's definitely a great healthy alternative for fast casual and meeting up with friends, too. I'll be back, but be prepared for a bit of chaos (just a bit)."}
{"text":"I love every flower child location in the valley. Each one has a little different ambience on the patio. Which is where we love to sit. And if you have you pooch their allowed also. They always have amazing tasting lemonades. And I am in love with the flying avacado..yummmy yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute stop. The flying avocado wrap was excellent along with the cranberry  pomegranate  lemonade. Customer service awesome."}

{"text":"My boyfriend took me here yesterday for lunch. I was happy they had kombucha on tap. The food is a bit pricy for what you get but it was really good. I had the skinny cob woth salmon it was 17 dollars for a pretty small salad but it was very tasty. I would go back if I wasn't starving and eanted a light lunch."}
{"text":"Meh. Food is always good, but in general over priced for the quality and portions. It seems to have tailed off over the last couple years.
Seems like waiting for drinks to be refilled and perpetual mess at the drink station.
Decent food...nice to have fresh but not a regular go to."}
{"text":"Finally made it over and it was worth it!  Flavorful and healthy!  Jerry and I shared 5 delicious sides and it was plenty.  Relaxed, casual setting. Will definitely return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Flower child is the place to go if you're looking for a delicious healthy meal. They specialize in having vegetarian and vegan dishes. The option of adding salmon, steak or chicken to any meal provides some satisfaction for carnivores. The meals are unique but all are quite tasty. They also have specialty lemonade and teas. It's a walk up and order setup but there is plenty of patio and indoor seating. Overall, it's the perfect spot to bring your vegetarian friends or satisfy your fix for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, filling food that I love. I like going during the day and getting some work done while I eat. There's plenty of tables inside and out in their cute place."}
{"text":"Great spot for vegans from out of town! We had the soba noodles, cauliflower , sweet potatoes, and beets with citrus salad. Some may think the portions are small, but we were completely satisfied. We'll be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for the third time today, and we had a stellar experience. Although Flower Child was busy (we were there at 1 p.m. on a Saturday) and the line to order was long, we got our food quickly and it was great. 

Flower Child is different than many other Fox Concept restaurants because you order your food, get a table number, and then have the food delivered to you (much like Sauce). Although it is more fast food \"style,\" the ingredients are of high quality, as are the staff. 

The vibe is awesome, very airy and fresh, and, as you might imagine, there are fresh flowers everywhere. The young staff is upbeat and friendly.

Some of the menu items change seasonally, which gives me hope that they actually do try to source their produce as locally as possible. Today, my mom and I shared the Vegan Caesar Salad and the Thai Dye Wrap. The Vegan Caesar Salad was great, with tons of fresh tender kale, veggies, and olives. The lemon tahini dressing was slightly tart, but it was great nonetheless. The Thai Dye Wrap was by far my favorite thing I've ever tried there. Marinated and thinly sliced tofu is paired with creamy avocado slices and Thai basil, then bundled into a soft wrap. I don't usually like tofu, but this was an amazing sweet and slightly spicy creation. 

I also love their desserts. I've tried the GF brownies, CC cookies, lemon cakes, and krispie bars, and they have all been nothing less than incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Food is no where near as good as True Food Kitchen, and I think price was almost the same. While I was ordering takeout, someone broke into my car and stole my computer bag with laptop, and my left over lunch. Criminals must be trolling the parking lot. I parked right you front too. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow! This a dream restaurant for a vegetarian and vegan! Our first time and we loved it! We had the chopped vegetable salad and the Thai cashew quinoa. Yum! Fast service and very clean. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Trendy, spendy and you'll go home hungry! Went for dinner this evening, small portions and way too much money for too little food. (two wraps, 2 drinks for $32) Noisy to the point of having to shout across the table to be heard. Line cooks with long hair and beards preparing food without hair nets and a few without latex gloves. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Dine in- consistently has been good. But, I've done take out a half a dozen times now and apparently take out equates to same price as in-house dining and dollhouse portions. Or, they have decided to increase the wrap price altogether while cutting the meal size in half. To spend 30 bucks on two sad little wraps with a couple whisps of lettuce when I used to get the EXACT same thing and it came with a substantial salad and a wrap I got 2 meals out of (dinner & lunch the next day) just another reminder why I don't go to Fox restaurants anymore. They do an impressive job up front, and then quality/quantity goes to hell once a location is established. So bummed out- this place was good (for dine in, take out portions have always been a joke) but I'm doooone. Done."}
{"text":"Flower child is part of Fox Restaurant Concepts, which is in my opinion, one of the best chain of restaurants. 

Anyway, this was my first time here, but I have heard many great things about it! You walk in, order, take a number, a seat and then your food will magically appear in a timely fashion! I ordered the winter sunshine salad with chicken, while my boyfriend got the \"forbidden\" rice bowl with chicken. Both very good, but the portion is small for the price. Flower child also has a variety of ice teas and lemonades that I believe are made in house, and you can refill for free!

Service is very friendly and fast. The decor is very fitting with the name of the restaurant. It's beautiful and fun. There is a patio outside, which during the day or when it's not winter in Arizona, I can see being a great choice! I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu; somehow Flowerchild manages to seamlessly blend comfort and health-food. Lovely, cheerful atmosphere and friendly service. The gluten-free Mac and Cheese, the Quinoa salad, and pink pomegranate lemonade are all family favorites."}
{"text":"Vegas needs more restaurants like this! Options for EVERYONE. Vegans, pescatarians, meat eaters and kids. I've had the vegan poke (many times) and the build your own plate with the glazed sweet potato and cauliflower. All amazing and 10/10. I wish they would work on flavoring their tofu a bit more. But many places don't so I won't knock a star down for that. Just a thought! Really busy during lunch and very instagram worthy for us millennials. I hope they bring a location to Henderson so I can stop driving so far for this place!   Also forgot to take a photo of my food. *fails at being a millennial*"}
{"text":"the options for healthy eating in the PHX just keep getting better and better. and thanks to the ever expanding food domination of Fox Concepts, we have another of his creations to thank. 

we have not had a single negative experience with Fox restaurants, and this newest addition (for us) is no exception. the decor...typical for cleanliness and absolute charm. 

the food is exquisite...and another option for veg heads without settling for other restaurants where the only option is \"veggie burger\" or \"salad\". portions here tend to veer on the \"lesser is better\" option and we agree. they even offer vegan wine....a bit expensive, but the novelty was worth it however, i'll stick with water next time. overall, prices are reasonable for the food. 

so many options i can't even begin....ok, i was going to try but there is just too much. and.....there are options for meat eaters, like grass fed beef. all in all, i was very pleased with my meal...it was flavorful yet simple. like i said, another great option for those of us trying to care for our bodies."}
{"text":"Fabulous! I get the pick 3 and change the selections each time. Haven't tried anything I don't like yet. The kids meals are a fantastic deal and they love it! So happy they have come to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Great menu -- all healthy -- kind of like build-a-meal, but in this case healthy also means tasty.  Cool, modern atmo, not retro, more industrial meets urban laid-back chic.  Love the high quality ingredients but reasonable prices.  The staff are WAY TOO NICE.  I guess I forgot what it's like to be out of L.A.  ;-)

Pleeeeeze open up one of these near me soon, ok?"}
{"text":"Good food, as expected.  Service was \"bah, humbug!\" and left a lot to be desired.  Not the friendly greeting or treatment received a year ago from the 44th st location.  No holiday decor, no festive atmo during the week between christmas and new year.  I regret leaving a tip on our take out order.

Location was nearly empty on 12/27.  We stepped in to get a quick \"take away\" order only to wait nearly 20 minutes and see others who ordered 5 minutes after us, walk away with their food before ours was ready.  This didn't make sense since there was almost no one there.  No help finding water cups and no lids offered knowing we were driving.  Not a stellar experience for 2 ready-made sides, 4 oz of grilled tofu and a simple tofu wrap."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal very much. Very healthy, the right serving and priced reasonable. Also very good customer service."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I'm obsessed with these kind of restaurants and have been to probably far too many in the Bay Area, so after a week of being relegated to eating whatever was available on my family road trip, I was so excited to bring my parents to Flower Child for a healthier take on lunch. Given that it was already 1:30 when we arrived, I was pretty surprised that the restaurant was still packed, but everything moved really quickly! The service is awesome, as they help you reserve a table while you wait in line to order, so you don't have to scramble by yourself.

FOOD: 
+/- Crushed Avocado Toast with Sesame Seeds & Soft Egg: As the basic that I am, I had to get the avocado toast once I saw it on the menu. Given that it's only 1 slice of whole grain bread, the $6 price tag was pretty hefty in comparison to the portions I've gotten at other places, but it was pretty decent! 
+ Brussel Sprouts + Sautéed Spinach + Chicken: I combined 2 sides with a choice of protein, and I have to say that the brussel sprouts are some of the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. I loved every bite. Sautéed spinach is on the average side - didn't see anything too special about them. The chicken is nicely cooked with just enough seasoning to make sure it isn't bland without dousing it in sauce as well! 

My parents got the Mother Earth bowl with tofu and the Madras Curry bowl with steak, and it got the stamp of approval from both of them! Sadly only 4 stars because the protein is really pricey to add on, but definitely super happy with my experience!"}
{"text":"Ok so we tried this place twice and the food was really good.  My review is for their unsafe food handling.  The first time we ordered Togo 2 forbidden rice bowls.  When we were picking them up we watched a cashier that handles money stick her bare unwashed finger in someone else's Togo order and move the food around, and then put the lid on and put it in the bag for the customer.  Luckily not us.  So I kind of ignored that and the following week only I ordered another forbidden rice bowl with chicken.  I got so sick that night and it has been 5 days now and my stomach still is a little off.  I can only attribute it to that bowl and then I remembered watching them stir a Togo with their finger!!  Yuck!  Food was great but no thanks.  Until they clean up their food handling we will not be back."}
{"text":"Fresh salads and food all around. This place really hits the spot. It's got a casual atmosphere with very attentive staff. I had a salad and added salmon as a protein. The lemonades and iced teas are not sugary sweet. This is a great lunch/fast healthy food spot. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok this is my favorite place in all of Arizona. I stumbled across this place while visiting my boyfriend in Phoenix and I had nothing to do so I saw that this place had good reviews so I was like let me check it out. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl because I saw that most people were ordering that. And man, it was the best dish I ever had. Every component of it was super tasty! From the roasted mushrooms to the red pepper miso vinaigrette. The broccoli pesto was also unique. I added meat as well and that made everything perfect. I also ordered the sides including the Indian spiced cauliflower and smashed potatoes. Those were super tasty as well. For a \"healthy\" place, everything tastes super delightful. They also have unique rotating lemonade flavors that are super refreshing as well. I literally go here every time I visit Phoenix (I'm from california). Atmosphere is super cute too! I highly highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We came from Sonoma County on vacation. We pretty much ate at Flower Child every day. So good!! I think a Flower Child would flourish in Sonoma County, Ca."}
{"text":"An unusual restaurant perfect for lunch. We sat on the patio. I was nice to have a light lunch. I had a baked sweet potato filled With a delicious assortment of veggies and chicken. My friend chose the triple plate where you can select 3 of a number of vegetable dishes. All sounded very tasty and smelled amazing.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Quick service, fantastic food, light and airy atmosphere.

Lunch for Family of three: $40 (including tip).

Me: cauliflower, green curry soup with shaved chicken and a side of Sichuan Green Beans
Him: Steak Plate with Grilled Asparagus and Smashed Avocado.
Child: Kid's chicken plate with Mac & cheese and broccoli. (Comes with a lemonade - tried pomegranate and ginger - VERY GOOD)

We were impressed with everything we tried and would definitely come back!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the chopped vegetable salad- really good. Portions are good and the food is filling but not heavy. The decor is really cute and hippie themed, and they have a nice little patio area. Vegetarian and vegan friendly."}
{"text":"I had a very bumpy start here (my g/f loves it so kept going back despite my personal disappointments).  I'm not too keen on how they simply 'add protein' to a meal, for example. I ordered the 'curry' with chicken; they serve an \"interesting\" (very atypical) curry dish, and plop slices of chicken breast on top at serving time. To me, a 'chicken curry' would have chicken pieces that were cooked in the sauce until saturated with flavor.  

But still ... I moved on to the salads, and I have to say, their salads are some of the best available!  I cannot stop ordering the Kale Salad, for example - their mixture is awesome, and the kale itself is the more hearty type, which I like. And the dressing ... amazing. I force myself to try other salads occasionally and they are good too.  I'm not one for eating at the same place that often, but I once went here 4 nights in a week for the salad (with Salmon). 

The décor / ambience is very nice, and they have some interesting drinks. They've recently started selling more beers, which I applaud ('craft brews' give me headaches unfortunately). They also have some good Ginger and Sarsaparilla drinks, and some Kombucha's. 

I cannot fathom why one reviewer said their portions are small. The salads are huge, as are the bowls. The wraps are more modest, perhaps, but more than enough for me."}
{"text":"Good food. Good quality. The thai quinoa is a great dish. Salads are good. I wish they had gf wraps. Good healthful food.

The lines are always really long at lunch, so I try not to go between 11:30 and 1:30. I like the food, but it is not convenient, especially at lunch. Parking is always impossible, even the 'to go' spots.

I find Salad and Go at 7th St and Bethany to be much easier and more affordable and now go at least once a day for organic non gmo ingredients and juices that are reasonably priced.  I had been a regular at flower child a few times a week, but it was a hassle. It always took a long time and things were often not labeled for take out orders."}
{"text":"Don't bother going for take out - no parking and the take out parking is always taken by people sitting in their cars. They don't label the salads that you ordered, which makes it tough if you group order. I order for multiple people often and use my expense account but I will not bother anymore."}
{"text":"Finally went here for the first time with my sister on Tuesday, and it was delicious! We both got the Heirloom Burrito Bowl (I believe that's what it was called, I can't seem to find it on the menu now! I hope they didn't get rid of it :/). It had tomatoes in some amazing kind of sauce, quinoa, corn, avocado and beans and lots of other great stuff! I would definitely get this bowl again - so healthy and filling without feeling grossly full afterward, and it was so tasty. We also got their gluten free chocolate chip cookie, which was amazing. I feel like a lot of times those kinds of desserts taste like something is missing, but this one didn't at all. 

The atmosphere inside Flower Child is great as well. Tons of light coming in, cute tables and different options for where to sit, and it's a great spot to get some work done too. They also have a bunch of outdoor seating options! Next time I definitely want to try their lemonade; they have so many great sounding flavors! I'd love to come in for breakfast sometime as well :)"}
{"text":"Got the thai dye wrap the first time I visited this place, it was pretty good, a little too much tofu for me. Got the \"choose your three items\" plate and I chose the sweet potatoes, GF mac and cheese, and asked the cashier for her suggestion for my last choice. She suggested the fried broccoli. The Mac and cheese was pretty good, the sweet potatoes were my favorite part (very tasty!), but the broccoli was burnt. I'll skip on the broccoli next time but I'll come back for the sweet potatoes. Overall yummy, but pretty pricey."}
{"text":"A week ago, we drove 20 miles (one-way) for breakfast. It was our first visit. Yesterday we drove again - for lunch. Today we are back for lunch, we missed breakfast cut off. Need we really say more - regarding their food??!! Other than glad we drive an economical car. We will be back!!!!! 
Update: I could eat here every day!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I go about once a week.... either take out or eat there. Mother Earth bowl is by far my favorite but I have tried the entire menu at this point. The price is high but reasonable for the high quality level of food and ingredients. I highly recommend. Try their teas and lemonades! Only downside ever would be the long lines during peak times at lunch/dinner- that's when I will usually call ahead and get take out!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and healthful lunch!  A variety of options and flavors, but anything you choose will be delicious, good for you, and satisfying!  To go is a good option, lunch is always packed!"}
{"text":"Friendly people but the food is over expensive.  $15+ for a small daily juice and what is the size of a large side salad at most places.  On the plus the salad and juice are both full of flavor.  Good flavor. That's why 3 instead of 2 stars."}
{"text":"Super healthy, organic, fresh food....Absolutely LOVE this location. Really laid back, cozy spot and their patio reminds of a garden. Great infused water selections that are complementary. Only reason why I haven't given it 5 stars is because the customer service isn't the best.... A lot of the young employees do not know the ingredients in the meals and wait for ordering food is always over 30 minutes (even when buying salads). Hope the new location improves on this since its closer to me :)"}
{"text":"Just a fantastic healthy meal.  It's only been open a few weeks and already the lines are out the door for both sit down and takeout on a normal Monday afternoon.  I ordered a forbidden rice salad with added tofu.  Large and full of different vegetables which made it nothing basic.  I saw broccoli and green beans and many other colorful fillings with additional jalapeno to spice it up.  Though it wasn't spicy whatsoever, it was still a nice dish to get the afternoon rolling.  The tofu was grilled nicely and tasted fresh.  Some of the better looking tofu I've had and presented well even at takeout where it was sliced thin and layed on top of the forbidden rice.Inside is pretty, kind of a sleek brunchy vibe.  Plenty of parking available and service was very fast with a takeout order called and picked up in less than 15 minutes, even during the rush of lunch.  Very impressed by Flower Child and will be back.  More of a higher end price-wise, at $14 for my salad with additional tofu, but well worth it for quality and taste."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. There are lots of healthy options including a mouthwatering, gluten-free Mac and Cheese and really good broccoli. Not to mention, everything is always hot. The staff is really friendly, and the ambience is fantastic. If you happen to be in the area, I strongly recommend stopping by this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian always looking for new vegetarian restaurants in the area. Flower Child is very close where I live  and very convenient for me. I went today Sunday with my boyfriend around 3 PM, the place was 90% full and we found a really nice spot outside. The food was delicious, mostly organic, good price considering the quality. The staff attention was good, lovely ladies explained us the menu and made us some recommendations.  The food was served really fast. I ordered red chili glazed Sweet potato with bok choy sesame seeds beats avocado citrus & tofu. I really enjoyed the tofu because was grilled. My boyfriend ordered the Veg Out with grilled Portobello hummus cucumber onions quinoa wrap, it was good but mine was much.  Decoration is nice and comfortable but nothing over-the-top. Definitely I'll come back to try other options"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food is awesome.... But the portions are tiny. So if your starving this is NOT your spot..... However they do have fresh food and veggies. I had the gluten free mac n cheese and the chicken and I highly recommend it. The pomegranate pear lemonade is a must also. Eat drink and be Merry my Friends."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always had great service but when I ordered online they missed two sides of potatoes and two sides of steak, I was not the one who picked up the food but received a call from my friend because they realized there was food missing. I told them what was missing so they went in to retrieve it but the flower child staff told them the only item which was missing was one side of steak, which they provided us with. I checked my order and I was in fact missing 2 potato sides and 1 steak side (which costs $14). Forgetting to give a customer $20 worth of food is not a small mistake and I would have expected the employees to look more carefully at the order especially upon being notified by the customer that they had messed up the order."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! It's hard to find a healthy restaurant that is still delicious. This is the one! I had one of the wraps and my husband had a salad. We were both pleasantly surprised. Definitely will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced hippie food. I do support and like the parent company Fox Concepts, but sadly I'd say this place was a disappointment for me. Sure the ambience is relevant and location is ideal but the layout and execution of the food is near catastrophic. Let's take the $7 avocado toast for example, this can be made at home on the same generic multigrain bread slice from any grocery store and still taste better...why not elevate the experience with a high quality bread slice that someone can't make at home. Other dishes tried were chicken tortilla soup (mostly a light broth overloaded with corn), and the vegan ingredient salad which showcased a Dijon mustard-y flavor beyond anything else. No thanks...2 people for lunch and $40 later, I'd rather enjoy their other sister restaurant next door - NorthItalia."}
{"text":"This place just makes me so happy! I drove by and was intrigued by their sign so I stopped for lunch, and I'm so glad I did. The staff is all so friendly and helpful; there was a young lady at the front asking people if they had been in before and providing help ordering, etc. I went with her recommendation on a wrap, The Rebel, and it was delicious! I got a side of the roasted beet, avocado and tangerines and that was super yummy as well. The portion was large, I only ate half for lunch and had the other half for dinner; which was good because the meal (wrap, side and a drink) was on the pricy side for lunch, about $20. 
The atmosphere is light and happy, it's a beautiful space. A good place to hang out and do some work or read a book. Everyone was friendly and seemed happy. I've gone back for lunch a second time and brought a friend, we both had the Flying Avocado wrap which was really good and I had to try their gluten free mac and cheese....YUM!

Love this place and will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"SO. MANY. OPTIONS. This place is great for anyone, especially those with gluten and dairy intolerance like myself! ...GF/Vegan dark chocolate pudding was the icing on the cake..."}
{"text":"another win for the neighborhood! the parking situation is a drag, but if you can get past that, Flower Child is worth the effort

I had the Kale salad..dee-lish and a 3 side combination of the broccoli/parm, beet/citrus and apple slaw...they were ok, but nothing spectacular

I will definitely go back to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Great selection of various foods! Win win! A must when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"New. Favorite. Restaurant.

Discovered Flower Child just a day before they opened, in passing. Then, miraculously *cough* an ad popped up on my Facebook letting me know that it was to open the next day! Excited, I took my sister and her boyfriend with me on opening day and we all loved it SO much that I brought my boyfriend with me the very next day!

The atmosphere is wonderful. Very Instagram-y and it really has this cute California vibe. When you walk in, you will find a to-go ordering counter and a dine-in ordering counter. Dining in, you'll place an order, they'll give you a number stand and you find your own table where they'll bring your food out to you.

The menu is medium-ish sized, but the number of combinations you can make with all of the items are endless. In the two times I've gone, I ordered the Avocado Toast (10/5!!! AMAZING) and the Mother Earth bowl (5/5). I can't tell you just how much I loved both. I added two proteins to my bowl: the Tofu (5/5) and the Salmon (5/5). The Avocado Toast is the best I've ever had (and I am a HUGE avocado toast fan) and all of the ingredients of the bowl are PHE-NOM-ENAL! The Tofu is a super firm, seasoned tofu. It's delicious and unlike any store-bought tofu I've ever tried. The Salmon was cooked perfectly with even a little crispiness around the edges.

The Avocado Toast was and will likely always be my all-time favorite. The avocado is roughly mashed, still chunky. They top it with crunchy sea salts (yum!), black sesame seeds, white cheddar (I mean, WOW) and chunks of soft-boiled eggs (droooooool). The coolest part is that they cut the toast into 3 slices for easy eating! NO mess and NO falling ingredients!

Opening days for restaurants can sometimes be pretty obviously hectic, stressful and a bit of a chaotic mess (even for the patrons). However, despite the line of customers out the door, service was quick, friendly, polite and extremely seamless! I was very impressed and I couldn't wait to come back the next day with my boyfriend to share in the amazingness that is Flower Child. (FYI: he LOVED it. And he didn't think he was going to!) I will be back. Again and again and again and again..."}
{"text":"I'd say my experience at this Flower Child was equally as good as my experience at the other location! The interior looks pretty much the same from what I remember, but it's been nearly a year since I tried the other one. The people working there were super nice, giving us samples of raspberry ginger kombucha and cucumber mint lemonade. The kombucha was kind of odd in taste, but the lemonade was so tasty! Also they were giving out free flowers, stickers, and headbands, which was pretty sweet.
Sometimes when a place first opens everything moves a bit slow for a while. But everyone working there seemed to know what they were doing. There was a line out the door when I first got there, and it moved pretty fast. I also noticed there were some differences on the menu. They did not have the delicious lentils I got last time! But seemed to have some new stuff. I ordered 3 sides, the sweet potato with bok Choy, the gluten free Mac and cheese, and the watermelon heirloom tomato salad. Portion was small for $9, but everything was delicious. The Mac and cheese was a tad too rich though, but very tasty. My sister got a mushroom pho and she liked it but I didn't like it very much. I also got a bittersweet brownie for dessert and it was delicious. So excited that this location is only like 10 minutes away from me since the other one was so far, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian who tries to stay away from too much dairy and gluten, I was VERY excited to hear about this place opening. It was pretty busy when I went, which was at a somewhat obscure time in the afternoon. Our cashier was very nice, told us about some of the delicious things they had to offer.

Their avocado hummus, oh my god. YUM. Would come back just for that, seriously so good. We got just veggies on the side, and it came with a nice array of dipping vegetables. It was beautiful. I usually only get water when I eat out but decided I wanted to try a tea or lemonade. All of the lemonades were too sour or had a flavor I did not like. I decided to go for the hibiscus tea and wasn't too happy with it. To me it just tasted kind of watered down. My mom liked it though! Just a matter of taste/ opinion I suppose.

Instead of getting an actual meal, my mom and I just got 4 sides and shared them. We got the roasted vegetables, the curried cauliflower, chili glazed sweet potatoes, and lentils. I love anything and everything sweet potato related so that was my favorite. Everything else was good as well. Finished off with sharing a bittersweet gluten free brownie, and a gluten free oatmeal cookie. The brownie was extremely rich, but they were both delectable. 

I also loved the decor of the restaurant, very cute. Would love to come back and get that amazing avocado hummus again..and try something new!"}
{"text":"3 dollars for a drink!!! If i was getting served  in a glass then maybe... Expand the menu too!! Excellent food and service otherwise, as usual for Fox."}

{"text":"Healthy, interesting menu, light and airy with patio dining. Reasonable prices. All fresh. I wish more locations."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant. As someone with a healthy lifestyle, it is often hard to find a quality place to eat out that aligns with my eating habits and dietary restrictions. The quinoa and sweet potato salad bowl with grilled salmon is my absolute favorite. And the beverage options are amazing, love their teas and lemonades. My only minor complaint is that I wish the menu pricing was more reasonable."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant! All great choices, all seem healthy, all are what I want to eat! The staff is super nice and welcoming. I had salmon with brussels, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, and had fun sampling the different ice teas. PLEASE come to Austin!!!!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Guns N Roses - Sweet Child of Mines)

It's got a salad that it seems to me
Reminds me of Mojito memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as an organic garden

Now and then when I attend the place
It takes me away to that special place
and if I stay too long
I'll probably Bo Bites and Yelp

Whoa, oh Whoa
Flower Child of mine

Whoa oh oh oh
Flower Child of mine

Flower Child is another concept by Fox.  What's up with his latest invention you ask?  Flower Child is a farm to table concept that is on the rise as more people are aware of the what they're putting in their mouth!  Or do they?  

So my group ordered the Asian Avocado salad with Chicken, Quinoa salad, Indian Spiced Cauliflower, The Rebel Wrap, and the Spicy Salmon Nabemono.  From what I gather; everything is pretty much vegetarian and you add your choice of protein; Chicken, Beef, Salmon, Tofu, all organic or natural of course!  

The Asian Avocado with Chicken was my favorite! The aroma of the sesame oil vinaigrette was sweet and spicy.  The Kale salad was fresh and crunchy along with the radish.  The Quinoa salad reminded me of a mojito.  No thanks to the Indian Spiced Cauliflower, too bland and charred while the seasoning just didn't go well with the soft sauteed cauliflower.  The Rebel wrap was delightful, but the horseradish yogurt can be over powering.  Finally, the spicy salmon had the sweet and smoky broth which was tasty, but everything was just a mushy mess.  

Overall, not a bad place for lunch for sure.  Definitely not a date place, but a lot of eye candy from what I see - wink!  In the end, the whole gluten free farm fresh to table thing is still new.  If I asked 10 people what Gluten is; I'm sure 1 or 2 can answer that question. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the forbidden rice with chicken and it was absolutely delicious. Also, the chocolate cake dessert was off the hook, and it was gluten-free but you would never know it. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The experience at Flower Child is different. First, You stand in a line to place your order, but they sometimes hold the line if the tables are full. They said this was because the food comes out SO QUICKLY. So, expect to stand for a considerable amount of the time you spend at this restaurant (at least if you eat during normal lunch or dinner time). Once seated, we waited more. The food doesn't come out quite as quick as they claim. Now, on to the food itself: it's good. The portions aren't giant, but this place is supposed to be for people that like yoga (there is even a yoga mat storage spot in the front). And it's expensive. The cheapest items that have protein are $11 (the Hippie Chick and Flying Avocado wraps). Overall, I think you can get food just as good without the waiting or the price in the area."}
{"text":"Flower Child in Scottsdale employees deserve a high five!

This is my first visit to Fox's Flower Child, as the restaurant is casual (you stand in line to order, get the food brought to you at the table) the service is compared to their sister restaurant The Henry! 

While waiting in line the staff keeps you busy in studying their menu (a must before approaching the cashier..) and offering drink samples.  The staff also asks if you are dining in and if so they assign you a number to give the cashier (did I mention they place the number on your table so the table is ready for you after you pay and get your drinks? - saves from having to table hunting!).

All food served at the Flower Child is gluten free, so anything you order is good for your heart, mind and soul! :-)  I had The Rebel which is a steak wrap and it had lots of flavor and tasted fresh.

The service was excellent, the food came within 10 minutes, the staff took up finished plates after eating and kept our table free of trash/straw wrappers.

If you're looking for a healthy place to eat The Flow Child is a place to go (need more restaurants like them).

{"text":"I didn't know it was here until the other day I stopped by for late lunch. I drove by here so many times but I guess I wasn't paying attention until one day I was hungry for something healthy.

Friendly staff took time to explained to me just about everything I wanted to know and didn't rush me to order. Once I ordered, I found a table and waited for my food. 

I like the selection of the drinks. Six different refreshing drinks, I picked the one with anti-oxidant. I didn't want anything too sweet and this one was perfect. 

I had curry with chicken for my meal. Chicken was juicy and tender, curry had great flavor. I enjoyed potatoes and fresh green beans.

They had several other dishes I was interested in. Looking forward to my next visit there."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day, had the Gluten-Free Mac & Cheese.   I must admit, I was not impressed.   Rather ho hum in flavor and presentation, you know, sort of that anemic look.   I do generally LOVE mac and cheese.   It's one of my go-to comfort foods, but not in this case.  Nothing about its taste to make it stand out from the crowd.

Thought I'd try it again and met friends there for dinner last night.   I had the Madras Curry with the added in chicken.   The chicken sort of had that in between boiled chicken flavor/texture and maybe thrown on the grill for five seconds?   It was flavorless.  If you've read my prior reviews, you know I hate boiled chicken.  UGH!! 

The mix of the veggies in the curry and the curry was good.   It's the Thai type of curry. It wasn't bad, but I've had it a few times at Thai restaurants and make it myself as well.   The texture, coloring of the veggies was perfect, sort of that al dente texture except for the potatoes.   The potatoes were cooked completed.   Can't do potatoes al dente and make it edible, you know.

I don't know that I'd return.  Both meals were rather ho hum, and there are too many places in town to eat ho hum food."}
{"text":"We had a large family dinner here over Christmas, and everyone was pretty happy with their orders. We had a variety of things, all very healthy options. The food came out pretty quickly, and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite place to get the hands down best food around! If you are looking to eat healthier food and love a peaceful environment to be around when you eat, this is definitely the place to go. The drinks are refreshing and the food is out of this world! They have a variety of specialty drinks to choose from and I personally love the rose lemonade! Not to mention that the customer service is outstanding and it is a very friendly atmosphere! I ate the avocado, cauliflower, and sweet potatoes. Favorite meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the atmosphere is fresh. It's modern but has a farm fresh vibe with a variety of tables configured both inside and out on a shaded patio. We were here before five and it's busy and people working here are moving at breakneck speed. The menu is overwhelming but inviting. Lots of choices and gluten free is clearly marked. I settle in on a glass of Melbec and a strawberry fields salad with chicken ($13). My husband orders a glass of beer and a burrito bowl with no protein. We order at a counter, pay and get our drinks and silverware but are asked on our receipt if we want to tip. Umm --No-- no for delivering a salad to me. I waitressed my way through college in restaurants where we had to do everything, including bus the table and serve desserts. No I don't think someone is entitled to a tip for bringing out our salad. The salad when it comes is good. It's fresh and has a nice presentation. But is it worth $13? I'm not sure? I've been sitting here sipping my 6 Oz MAlbec and our bill was $36.70 and I'm still hungry. My husbands burrrito bowl was ($9) without a protein. He said it was good but not any better than chipotle, which would have been much larger and have a protein. It was good, but definitely Scottsdale prices-- not sure this business model would work in Tucson-- unless a price adjustment was in order!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a healthy meal.  I usually get the Mother Earth bowl with either chicken or salmon.  The Mother Earth comes with ancient grains, sweet potato, avocado and a few other ingredients.  It really is delicious and the serving is large so recently I've been taking some of it home for another meal.

I also really like their juices and teas. I usually mix a green tea with the lemonade.

The cashier and servers are always super nice."}
{"text":"Went to flower child with some friends. It is right up my wife's alley. Eclectic modern food. She is a vegetarian so it was good. My meal was the worst of the 4 that we ordered. I didn't care for the shaved chicken and forbidden rice. I love forbidden rice and this was weak. 
Everything else was good. The chicken salad, veggies, and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Our family of five dines here at least twice a week. With a variety of healthy choices, there is something for each of us- even our gluten free child.  Some of my favorites are the Mediterranean quinoa salad, the avocado toast, the soups, the forbidden rice bowl and the Brussels sprouts!  My kids love the Mac and cheese, the spinach and the Brussels sprouts.  The tea and lemonade is great too. The only complaint- it's pretty pricey, but we pay it for the quality food and consistent experience."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and every time is just as good as the last. Would recommend to anyway who likes healthy food. Vegan options, vegetarian options, there's something for everyone here. Although the prices are a little much, it's worth it in the end for tasty, filling food that you won't forget. Everyone should try out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"kind of expensive for the fare. Steak with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese...
small portion of steak..I mean really small. ok tats. mac and cheese to me is macaroni noodles with a variety of cheeses..their idea is PASTA noodles with a sprinkling of cheese...

the drinks are 4 bucks...really? come on ..out of a big container that probably cost them
a few pennies?? give me a break...nope...never again"}
{"text":"A salad with chicken was $15.  Though the chicken had good flavor and there were some fresh ingredients, for the price the portion was small, I hoped it would make a decent light meal.  But the amount of iceberg lettuce made it a ho-hum expensive side salad."}
{"text":"The one star that it was missing has nothing to do with Lindsey. It was actually 4.5 stars... This was in continuance of Elite Event held this past Sunday that started with a butt kicking at Orange Theory. Lindsey was kind enough to not only make sure we got our butts whipped into shape, but to take us out for a late lunch/early dinner afterwards. 

The restaurant, ambiance, and staff were AWESOME!  Rob who was the manager came by and talked to us about the restaurant, the food etc as well as the head chef. I ordered one of the mix and match plates on which I had the red chili glazes sweet potato with bok choy & sesame seed, roasted brussels sprouts & wild mushroom, sauteed spinach with garlic, chili flake and lemon with salmon. Now that sounds like a ton of food right? Actually it was portioned perfectly. Just enough to have small side dishes of each with the salmon on top. The half star it is missing is that although the food was good, it was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Like it needed a little more seasoning or something, a little omph if you will. I did try my friends Sweet Corn & Quinoa with Greek yogurt and let me tell you, I was sad that I didn't have that as one of my sides because it was DELICIOUS!  I washed it down with some of the best lemonade I have had in a very long time.  The staff came around and gave us some avocado hummus to try in which we were all very happy with along with a few samples of different drinks that they had to offer. 

All in all, it was a lot of fun and again the staff went ABOVE and BEYOND. They were some of the nicest people I have ever met and seemed to really enjoy working there. Will I be back? Absolutely. I am not on that side of town often but I definitely will make a point to stop by from time to time. It was well worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food omg is so good. Love this place. Love the atmosphere. Employees are nice and attentive."}
{"text":"So happy we found this gem. Delicious fresh food. Mother Earth bowl with tofu tantalized every taste bud. Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl with steak for the hubby was perfect. Very friendly staff. We ate dinner around 5pm and it kept us both satisfied throughout the night. Lemonade naturally sweetened. You're not going to find soft drinks here, but the fresh Tea is nice substitute."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Flower Child, and recently I ordered take out that was not quite up to their usual high standards. After calling and letting the restaurant know my issues, they immediately worked to assuage the situation by offering me a new meal, and they went into the kitchen and swapped out the ingredients I had initially complained about. FCR are notorious for their customer service, and Flower Child is no exception! Thank you for serving delicious food, and having kindness and understanding when something is not quite perfect. WILL come back again (and again and again)."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner. We all had wraps. The Rebel, Flying Avocado and Bird is the Word. All delicious. I would recommend for lunch or dinner. Yum."}
{"text":"Never ever had anything here other than fantastic! I always get three sides for $9 but I always get the same ones lol - creamy corn, cauliflower, and watermelon/tomatoes. They use to do roasted veggies which were amazing but no longer on menu....pa-lease bring them back! A-ma-zing!!!!"}
{"text":"I met a small group of friends here yesterday for lunch. My forbidden rice bowl with salmon was tasty, but the portion was small. I could have held the contents of the bowl they brought me in both my cupped hands. And it was $17!! 

Plus, the restaurant is VERY noisy. I had trouble hearing even the person sitting across the table from me. We spent the first few minutes of our lunch shouting at each other about the price of our meals and giving ourselves sore throats. Maybe this is why they sell the honey lemonade? We agreed to try elsewhere next time. 

I appreciate the fresh concept and the varied menu. If I were evaluating solely on taste, I would give it 4 stars. However, I had to dock one star for ambiance (noise) and one for price. It's just too unreasonably priced, especially if you can't talk to your friends while you're eating."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone it has been busy, however the wait never seemed outrageous. I've only tried the kale salad and the quinoa salad. They are both so good I don't want to get anything else lol. If you're in the mood for a quick healthy meal this is the place. The atmosphere is awesome and the lemonade is to die for. It is somewhat pricey but you leave feeling healthy and full!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Very cute lunch spot. The food is great, the atmosphere is so pleasant. The have fresh juice, kombucha, organic wine and beer, and fun selection of ice tea including lavender. There is even \"yoga mat parking.\" I got the avocado toast and it was heavenly!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for the healthier fast food option and this place had exactly what I was looking for. It's super busy at lunch time, I would recommend phoning orders ahead. I got the mother nature bowl with tofu and it was so good and filling. I couldn't finish it all because I got so full from the grains. Definitely will come back to this place, now if only they would deliver."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good! I went with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed it. He got the steak plate with Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. I'm not going to lie, when they brought it out it looked really plain and I was kind of scared that there wasn't going to be any flavor. But omg, when we both tried it, it was so good! Every thing was very flavorful! I was surprised, lol. I got the skinny cobb salad with chicken and it was good too! I love how they weren't greedy with their dressing! And the lemonade was good too! Very refreshing! It's a bit pricey but I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the place that I go to when I want to pretend that I am healthy.  Super cute atmosphere and a great spot for lunch.  The food doesn't necessarily blow me away, especially for its price.  But when I friend suggests we go I won't put up a fight.  Also, the lemonade is the bomb."}
{"text":"My best friend kept hearing about how amazing Flower Child is from her co-workers at the bank. We set a date and decided to dine in on Saturday afternoon.The food was spot on delicious with a perfect medium steak and fresh sides. We can't wait for more lunch/dinner dates at Flower Child and are so happy to have Flower Child in our community of Summerlin!"}
{"text":"I avoided going to Flower Child for the longest time because I heard that the food wasn't worth the price. Last night, I actually decided to check their menu and uhhhhhhh seriously what have I been doing with my life? I guess Asian smarts don't always include common sense because the prices here really aren't that bad.... and the food is GOOD. 

I got two dinners for myself and my boyfriend (combined, not each; although we are both hungry hungry hippos). One was a steak plate with three sides: cauliflower, mac & cheese, and the watermelon tomato salad. We also got the forbidden rice bowl per the cashier's suggestion. Everything had a unique and delicious flavor. Complex but well balanced. Not only that all the different colors made the meal extremely aesthetically pleasing. 

Home run, guys. I'll probably be in soon (like in 5 min)."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! It's so amazing. The place is beautiful I love the decor and pretty much everything lol. 

We came in and didn't know if we had to order first or go sit down and wait for a waitress so I asked the guy at the register and he was so nice and friendly and told us how it all worked so we placed our order and went to go get our drinks and the way they have their lemonades and utensils set up it's so cute. 

We decided to sit down outside and it was so nice our waitress came and dropped our food she was also very nice she also picked up our plates when we were done. 

We ordered the Mother Earth bowl with steak and it was so delicious after eating it, I felt so refreshed the lemonade was very delicious too. The best part is all the food is healthy and I thought it was gonna be expensive but it's not :) 

Will I be back soon? Of course! I would eat here everyday if there was one closer to my house."}
{"text":"Flower Child is my go-to place for a nourishing meal. They honestly never fail, their staff is so helpful and sweet, and I always feel like a million bucks after eating their food (rather than feeling tired or gross)! win/win/win

I've had most of the menu at FC - I love the vegan poke bowl, and the Vietnamese Crunch salad is so cool and refreshing. But there's one thing I just can't quit. And it's the plate. 

Basically, you get to pick 1-3 items of your choice. As a person who can never decide what to eat, it's my dream. 

I always get the green vegetable of the moment (right now, I'm loving the green beans), the sweet potatoes, and sweet corn & quinoa. Sometimes I even live large and get 4 sides!

I am also obsessed with their little gluten free lemon cakes and chocolate chip cookies and also the amazing flavors of lemonade but I do my best to forget they exist because they're just *too good*!

Love the proximity to my office. Probably a good thing it's not closer. 

10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is my go to place for healthy fresh food. Not quite fast food, but not a sit down for hours kinda meal. I usually pick three sides (which at times theyre out of) and a protein for my go to order...you need to try the cauliflower. This time around i tried the mushroom pho. I would recommending passing on this dish...it has a weird broth consisting of mushrooms, herbs and cinnamon (which to me over powered everything). There are better things on the menu that will be sure to impress. They do serve a limited selection of wine and beer."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Flower Child for so long... I don't know what I was waiting for! AMAZING!!! I ordered the Mother Earth Bowl with chicken and I ate every last bite. So delicious! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm far from a hippie, but I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts, and Flower Child is my new favorite...

I've already been a handful of times and while I admit, it's on the pricey side, I'll pay more for organic, local, healthy cuisine any day.  Be warned, however: the parking lot can get crowded during lunch, but it's worth it to park farther away or be patient and wait for a spot... 

Once you step inside Flower Child, you'll find friendly service and tons of menu options for both adults and kids.  (I still want to take my kids in to see if they like the kiddie options, but I've seen others enjoying).  

It's a fast casual concept, so order at the counter and find your table and your food will be brought to you.  That is, of course, after a pit-stop to fill your drink cup with your choice of three different teas and / or three different lemonades.  I suggest mixing and making your own unique version of an Arnold Palmer.  Free refills included!

The Asian Avocado Salad with Chicken or Salmon is my latest go-to order for lunch, but I don't think you can go wrong here... just order whatever sounds good and know you'll be nourishing your body with healthy ingredients.  You've gotta feel good about that!

As an afterthought worth sharing, I did order the Raw Local Veggie appetizer a couple of times in the hopes that it would compare to True Food Kitchen's Crudite appetizer, but sadly, it does not.  The Tzatziki at Flower Child is not good at all.  I'd suggest serving with the black olive tapenade like TFK and/or getting the TFK tzatziki recipe instead.

Lastly, if you're looking to bring food in for your family, friends, or a small gathering, Flower Child does offer a \"Family Dinner\" option that seems reasonable.  I look forward to checking that out sometime soon.

Cheers to FRC, Flower Child, and healthy / happy visits ahead!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix and wanted a healthy type place with veggies.  Found this on yelp!!!
Wow was it good.  Enjoyed the food greatly.  I found the sides especially good.  The sweet/spicy sweet potatoes, eggplant, and cauliflower were awesome.  There were three of us and we all loved it.  The ambience was fun and comfortable.
Things were clean and service was friendly and helpful.
The only minor thing is while the drinks/ice teas were good and fresh, they lacked a little punch.  The tea with rose did not have much rose and the same with the passion fruit one.
All and all was great and looking forward to returning on another visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tried the crushed avocado toast at the Uptown Flower Child. Delicious! This is my new post run stop for breakfast!

Back for the avocado toast. Today the bread wasn't toasted, no hot tea and staff are busy chatting on texting. No one asked how my food was or even showed any concern for the customers. Shame."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times.  The food is very, very good.  The quality is excellent.  The staff is plentiful, friendly, and courteous.  They are all well trained.  The problem is that I often leave hungry after spending $50.  Well, not hungry; but not totally satisfied.
Last night I ordered the soup of the day - a green curry thai cauliflour thing.  It was very good.
However, they filled the bowl less than 1/2.  You pay $6 and get less than 1/2 a bowl.  I brought it back to the line and asked that they fill the bowl.  They did with a smile...but why did I have to ask????  Anyway, the soup was fresh, hot, and delicious.  
I also ordered the Vietnamese salad with steak as the protein.  $16. for a salad.  Not super large, but super delicious.  Fresh, great dressing, excellent ingredients.  
If they served bread and butter with the salad, it would make all the difference in the world.

Also, I ordered iced tea.  You get the glass and you go and fill up with 6 choices....Not sure how much it was but I bet it was over $3.  But you get refills.  There is some stevia there which you need bc all the choices are unsweetened.  It was fun watching the kids try it...they hate it bc its so natural they are not used to it!!!

All in all I do like this place and I will go back.  Its just very overpriced ($50 for two salads, two iced teas, and a cup of soup)....they also ask for a tip on the receipt when you pay with credit card!!!  Ain't that a hoot?  A tip for taking your order!  They are SUPPOSED TO DO THAT - 

I suggest they remove that option.  If I want to give a tip to someone who takes my order I'll do it; but don't make me feel bad the rest of the meal for not tipping the order taker!

But the food is great.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is young and chic, and the outdoor seating area is spacious and comfortable.  Every customer drives a Mercedes and Lexus...tells you about who goes here."}
{"text":"I visited Flower Child for the first time yesterday with a friend. What a wonderful restaurant! I will be going there every chance I get. I tried the Mother Earth bowl with sliced chicken. Simply yum."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The food is so hearty and delicious, and for how kitchy the restaurant is, you would expect it to be more expensive. It's a bit more expensive than fast food, don't get me wrong, but the quality is so good, you really are getting a great deal. 

I need to put a quick qualifier on this and say that this stops being true pretty quickly if you are committed to meat with every meal. Adding \"protein\" is a pricy proposition here, but it's also 100% not necessary. You'll be full with chicken or without, so I would say skip it. This place does vegetarian fare really well, so enjoy it!

The restaurant layout is perfect for a casual lunch with friends, and a wide variety of tea and lemonades to have as a beverage. I really do love this place."}
{"text":"SO MUCH YES!!! I came here last night for the first time and immediately fell in love, as soon as I stepped foot out of my car and saw the beautiful flowers and bright decor! I loved that vegan options were easy to find (although I got different answers from two different people as to whether or not their muffins were vegan). The iced tea and lemonades were delicious, the food fresh and yummy, and the service was stellar. The non-vegetarians in the group equally loved their dishes. The restaurant is so adorable, SO SO adorable. They even have a cute hand washing station (awesome!). So MUCH YES YES YES! Now if only they could open one closer to Chandler. Hahaha! Can't wait to go back. Keep up the good work Flower Child!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Really enjoyed the food and ambiance. Daughter had Lotus bowl with salmon and I had 2 sides and chicken. Very pleasant and large enough portions without feeling over full. 

It's gorgeous on the patio!  Weather really cooperated!  

Staff was friendly and cordial. Definitely will be back to try other entrees. Clean and cute!"}
{"text":"Really nice options and flavors for everyone.  Easy to modify for gluten free.  I've had salmon and chicken with choices of rice, veggie, gluten free pasta.  Lovely out door seating available.  Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Second visit and will return. Everything was flavorful, fresh and healthy! Boomers easing into vegan will find comfort in the vegan salad. As others mentioned, GF Mac and cheese tastes creamy and delicious; it's served in a soup cup that looks like a tiny portion but rest assured, it's filling. Save room for GF brownies and cookies. Wherever you are, go the extra mile(s) to eat in, take out or have Flower Child delivered!"}
{"text":"Meh. This place was OK - but I've definitely experienced better. It's a bit pretentious and overpriced for what you get.

The overall vibe is modern-hipster with a touch of hippie. The decor is modern-chic with a touch of hippie. The music is loud-ish. 

Orders are placed at the counter and food is brought out to the table. The staff was friendly, so no complaints there! 

We ordered 3 starters plus 2 meals. We left hungry. But in all fairness, we went hungry and we went for dinner. This is more of a lite-bite type of place: Lunch or a lite dinner. 

Starters: Sautéed spinach, Indian cauliflower, and watermelon/tomato salad. All tasty. Nothing special. Small portions. 

Meals: Chopped salad with salmon and Mediterranean salad with salmon. Both were decent. The salmon was cooked well. The veggies on the chopped salad weren't the freshest.... In fact, they were mostly brown. Ew. 

Overall, I don't think this place is worth it... unless you want to stare at all the beautiful blondes behind the counter. Seriously - being platinum blonde must be a requirement to work there haha. Why no hot men?

Two stars because I'd rather go to Whole Foods and buy cheaper fresher food from the salad bar. I left this place feeling very underwhelmed and saying, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Yum! First visit and it did not disappoint. I had the forbidden rice bowl with shaved beef and it was delicious! There were so many things off of the menu that I wanted to try. Will definitely be going back. Loved the selection of iced teas and lemonade. My favorite of the Fox restaurants!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on the way home from running an errand. I decided to have lunch after realizing I was getting hungry and that they offered healthy food. You walk in and order your food at the counter and they gove you a number. Seating is open and the chairs are comfy. I ordered the $5 kombucha on tap and it was both refreshing and very tasty. Also oredered the brussel sprout salad and added the sustainable salmon to it. It was delicious. I like salmon and this one was moist and flavorful. This place has a whimsical feel to it. There's a relaxed vibe and the music is loud enough to hear but mellow enough to still be able to hear the person your sitting next to. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolute best healthy food in Phoenix.   

Really cool scene with a relaxed yet classy vibe.  The place is like a much better version of tru food kitchen.  Instead of dousing everything in oil, you get fresh use, more varied, and creative greens.  

I love their salads and they have an eclectic selection which are all easily made vegan.   You can add tofu (very flavorful) or other proteins.  I heard people oohing and ahhing over the salmon.   

The chefs cooked the food with some precision and even bring it out to people.   

Portions are on the sizable side and they have a bevy of healthful drinks.   

I enjoyed the variety of sides one could add to their meal from butternut squash and vegetable soups to fruits and grains.   

I can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how excited I am to see more healthy places to dine popping up. This was my second visit to this Flower Child. 

My first experience was a good one and the wrap I had was good as well. This time I was slightly irritated that they open at 11:00 they had people one their patio and what looked to be servers on the patio assisting customers. However, as the line formed in front of us (we were the first ones there) they made sure to keep those doors locked until exactly 11:00 am. We lined up behind all of the people who were crammed up to the glass as we sat in the hightop chairs just to the right of the main entrance. 

I ended up getting the Mother Earth bowl with chicken. Perfect portion size, delicious preparation and I left feeling fed, not stuffed. The staff was very tentative and took away items that needed to be and asked if we needed anything else. I love ginger beer, they have that too and though bottled, simply awesome and reminds me of my grandpa...

I forsee more Flower Child in my future!"}
{"text":"Many restaurants leave me feeling full and satisfied, but this is one of the few that left me inspired as well. The simple, yet tasty, menu of salads and bowls made from all-natural ingredients was a huge reminder that contrary to popular belief, healthy and delicious go hand-in-hand. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl, and never did I think I would so deeply enjoy a simple medley of roasted and raw veggies. It's left me with a resolve, stronger than any I've had for New Year's Resolutions past and present, to eat clean and eat green.

In addition to the incredible food, there were a million \"little things\" that made me smile. The restaurant is whimsically decorated with flowers, hand calligraphed signs, and rustic furniture. There's a small basket by the entrance for \"yoga mat parking\" and a sink right next to the dining area for easy hand-washing before eating. The entire atmosphere puts you at ease and I promise that it will do an unexpectedly good job of lifting your mood. As a San Francisco resident, I can't say I've found a salad place in my own health-obsessed city that can rival Flower Child!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled!!! I got the Madras Curry and the Indian Spiced Cauliflower! Oh where to start great flavor perfect portion sizes. It really caters to different dietary needs! My husband had the Birds the word he said it was wonderful as well. If you are trying to eat healthy and tasty food this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! My first time here and they walked me through the menu and gave me samples."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked into this Woodstock version of a country home. It is filled with flowers and forks and knifes in mason jars are placed on each table. 

It was easy to place an order. The line was out the door.... I had to see what all the fuss was about...

As I'm waiting on line as if I'm on line at Barney's 50% off sale. I noticed everyone was really enjoying their meals. I want one of everything I thought but I ordered the grilled salmon with mash potatoes and sautéed spinach.....

We took our number and sat down.... I walked to the beverages in the back of the Restraurant only to see an array of natural drinks.... like freshly squeezed lemonade, fresh brewed ice tea in peach and strawberry, coconut water.....I'm loving this place already..... 

As I returned to table I was a little surprised by the portion size of the food....The portions were great for me but if your an adult male who's looking to get their grub on.... Turn around and go back to the car!!! This place is portion controlled.... No doggie bags here!!!! 

The salmon, spinach and mash potatoes were neatly placed in a bowl... YES... A bowl not a plate but boy it PACKED A PUNCH!!!! 

It was very good and satisfying to say the least.  Look if your looking for a healthier and cleaner eating experience this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great place for wonderful salads, and more! So much to choose from! My girlfriend's and I, came here for lunch! So pretty inside! Service and food was great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. Everyone I go, the waitresses and waiters are always so nice. A lady with long black hair working the to-go was very nice and awesome! I love the vibes and I recommend it to my family and friends. It is a little pricy if you're eating with a group, but it is all worth it. The food is fresh and I feel so healthy after I eat it."}
{"text":"Fab salads, reasonable price for the quality and amount of food. Loved the kale salad with slices of pink grapefruit, apple, smoked almonds, white cheddar, and black currants. Apple cider vinegar on the side was the right balance of sweet and tang. Recommend!"}
{"text":"They are rude. Told me what to order and was very rude when I wanted a different dressing. Will not return"}
{"text":"I have hospitality management bachelor degree and I know customer service very well . I love their hospitality. All employees have smile and you can see the different vibe and very good and positive energy. Their service and food were amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Flower Child on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. I was expecting this place to be vegetarian only, but I was pleased to find there were meat options. We apprecaited that they served local beer opposed to the standard grocery store selections. 

The service was alright - the cashier was underage and couldn't ring us up. She seemed to have a moment of panic and shouted behind for help, but they figured it out. 

The food came out quickly and was cooked well. The location provides tasty, healthy options. While on the higher end of cost for salads and wraps, it's somewhere we would consider going again."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this place.  I have been here twice in one week and ordered the same salad.  I had the Mediterranean Quinoa salad with Chicken.  I asked them to give me the Ginger Miso Vinaigrette on the side instead of the Harissa Yogurt Vinaigrette that comes with the salad.  The portion size was sufficient.  Just what expected. Love the salad...so many different textures and taste.  Nothing over powered the other items.

The first time I came here, my husband was with me.  He ordered Plates - pick two with steak.  The one thing noticeable about the plate when it arrived was how SMALL the portion was.  He said the food was good but it was not enough for him.  I don't think it would have been enough for me either.  By the way, we're not big eaters."}
{"text":"Finally!!! Exactly the vibe we so needed in this town! I'll be back to try every single dish, promise!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for a quick and delicious lunch! Probably the most delicious healthy food you can find in the East Valley, Flower Child has options for everyone. I always mix and match three sides and one of those sides is ALWAYS the Red Chilli Glazed Sweet potatoes. I am telling you right now there are no better sweet potatoes than the ones at this franchise! This trip I also got the Spicy Japanese Eggplant and Sautéed Spinach, a trio sent from health heaven. Their lemonade and tea station is super cute and seasonal so there is always lots of fun flavors to sample. I paired my meal with a mix of the Japanese Sencha Green Tea and the Cranberry Lemonade. My friend got the Vegan Poke Bowl with a side of sweet potatoes (they mistakenly brought mashed potatoes instead but quickly and kindly brought out another side when we told the waitress). She said that her meal was the highlight of her week. Definitely stop and try this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Flower Child-  excellent fresh healthy alternative to most of the Vegas eateries!  It makes eating healthy-  so much more fun!  Mother Earth bowl and a kombucha on tap!!!! Thanks Flower Child!!"}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this restaurant and so happy to have it in Summerlin! This area was definitely in need of a restaurant like this. I love that it is fast casual, The ambience is amazing and inviting . Now , the food ! I have been four times and Everything I have had has been great . ..I can't wait to try the whole menu. The Thai cashew salad with salmon is absolutely my favorite and the avocado lemon dressing is delicious ! I hope the service stays great , everyone that works there is very helpful and on top of it! Maybe more cashiers ? Sometimes a long line"}
{"text":"I have been this location a few times.  I like my visits but I was not loving them.  Yes, it is a healthy alternative and it does offer a lot of selections.  I wanted to the hummus with pita plus chicken.  I guess their system will allow you to order hummus with pita or hummus with chicken.  So I had to order hummus with pita and chicken on the side.  OK, I just want all three items regardless of how you put in the system.  The place was pretty busy and it was packed.  We found a table, but it was dirty.  Waited for a staff member to stop by but nada.  So we cleaned it ourselves.  Got our food and the hummus and chicken was not that flavorful.  Loved that they have many flavors of ice tea to choose from."}
{"text":"Flower Child...has to be one of my faves! I recently moved here from Northern VA/DC area and we have NOTHING like this.  My best friend and I made this one of our first stops when I moved and I'm so glad we did.  I had the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl with Tofu and it's my fave! til this day my friend from back home still texts me saying how much she craves this place! Prices are reasonable and it's nice to have such a healthy, delicious food options.  

My first visit I was a little confused on the order of seating and ordering your food.  You basically come in and get in a line where there are menus off to the side and order at the cashier.  From there someone is assigning you a table number and you let the cashier know your number. different concept from what I used to in DC but it seems to work well!

I can't wait to get to flower child again, it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best healthy, fresh, clean eating places in the area.  Both the food and the service were exceptional considering it was in the middle of lunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious, healthy food and daily homemade juices. Stopped in during a work day to get some work done and have a healthy meal. Very fast and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"I love the happy and healthy vibes at Flower Child! I had the squash and Brussel sprout salad and a juby true juice, left me feeling ready to tackle the day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place! So Cute and and wonderful decor inside and out! The food is prepared fresh and you can even see everything going on as they prepare the dishes. They have mix and match where you can pick what veggies, meats etc go into your dish along with Gluten Free and Vegan notes to all those items. They have Kombucha and fresh made juices too! Really great place to go with choices for everyone, perfect for a place with girlfriends to sit and chat, the dining hall is bustling when busy and more noisy, lots of outdoor seating with cozy tables and misters. Friendly upbeat staff. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"NO WIFI.  This place has a good scene, healthy food, and friendly staff.  But man, oh man, is it overpriced compared to Chop Shop or LGO.  Scan the reviews and you'll see this is a consistent theme.  Went twice and probably won't go back.  I would give the food 4 stars and the value 2.5."}
{"text":"Simply Delicious! I got the Mother Earth bowl with the salmon it was so flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My brother was staying at the Shea medical clinic last weekend and I wanted to grab us something to eat while I visited. I order two dishes for us. While walking through the hospital I noticed I didn't have my brothers dish in the bag. I was starving and didn't bother to double check the bag as I ran out of the restaurant! When I got to the room I called Flower Child to let them know I was on my way back over for the missing dish. The manager I spoke to was so accommodating! HE BROUGHT US THE MISSING DISH TO THE HOSPITAL LOBBY! Threw in a dessert and comp'd my brothers dish which I was not expecting at all! All within a few minutes from my call. 
Aside from the food being delicious, I loved the customer service. I wish I could remember the managers name..."}
{"text":"Love this place!! You can sit outside or inside and order anything off the menu and you can bet you will love it! Fresh, wholesome ingredients made by chefs in an open kitchen space. The people working their are highly attentive and will address any need that you have. What I like about this place is that it's not a typical restaurant. You order your food when you get there and receive a number, then they deliver your food to your table and basically leave you to yourself after that. If you have the chance read the Tao of Flower Child that is written on the wall. Enough said..."}
{"text":"Great food. Very accommodating to vegans. I got the Mother Earth bowl with tofu, it was flavorful and fresh. My girlfriend got the pick three side dish combo, the portions were huge and filling. The atmosphere felt like a cross between Starbucks and whole foods. I could not have been happier."}
{"text":"THE BEST TOFU! I'm not a vegetarian but I love good tofu and this place does it right! The vegan ingredient salad has grilled tofu that looks and tastes like chicken! The Tye die wrap is a nice light lunch plate. They have a great variety of teas and lemonades. I wish this place was closer to Home. I would make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Who are these Foxes?  I'm in love with them and their design/ concept team. I want to meet them, hang out with them & talk shop, design, beauty & food!  I'm putting it out there- anytime you all have a party, invite me and I'll be there!!!
Walking into Flower Child is like walking into freshness. Immediately I felt refreshed and recharged. Everything is done just right from the vibe of the place down to the rust spots on the farm \"chandeliers.\"  It's the kind of place aside from having amazing conversation, if out of space, you can throw a blanket on the floor, start a picnic on the floor with your entrees and still feel right at home. 
And the food!  The menu is organic, gluten free, vegan with options of chicken & steak for protein. And everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. It's nourishment for the eye, soul & body. 
I had their chicken, roasted vegetables, and cream corn with quinoa & kale and each bite was a morsel of a delicate kiss to my body & soul.  I don't think you will have any regrets ordering anything from the menu. 
The BEST part I have to exclaim to the WORLD is that their kid's menu unlike so many other establishments that serve terrible food like chicken tenders, Mac & cheese, etc. they serve the same wholesome, delicious food to the mini me's. 
It's wonderful, absolutely wonderful that they do this. Whoever came up with this idea has made my wish come true and I hope other restaurants take notice and follow suit. 
Absolutely a love!"}
{"text":"Omg...Best meal I've had in Scottsdale. Amazing flavor profiles and textures! I had the Mother Earth bowl. It's well balanced. Especially liked the broccoli pesto. Organic, non gmo, and vegan to boot!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Everyone so nice and the food is delicious!!! I love that it's organic & they have options for Vegan, Vegetarian & gluten free! My absolutely favorites Mother Nature I highly recommend everyone to try this dish!"}
{"text":"We visited on Sunday, August 7th at 1:00 p.m.  Counter service and food - great!  I had the Freebird wrap - very yummy!  My lunch companion had the Forbidden Rice and stated it was delicious.  This was a 5-star experience until the end of my meal.

Busser service - not so good!  I had literally just ate the last bite of food and put my fork in the bowl - as soon as the fork hit the bowl this guy just grabbed the bowl and walked away!  There was no communication whatsoever - 'how was your meal', 'glad to have you join us today', 'do you need anything else' - nothing.  It was as if there was a mad rush on bowls and the kitchen was out of them and he was getting a bonus based on how quick he could remove them from tables.  I observed him do this same thing with other tables - one woman was still chewing her food and he grabbed her bowl without saying a single word.  People had a somewhat shocked look on their faces - as did I.  My lunch companion wondered if we were being rushed to leave (there were plenty of open tables).  Did I need the bowl and fork any longer? Probably not.  It would have been much better to wait until all parties have completed their meals before removing the entree plates or at least have the courtesy to ask and not just grab and go.  He was young, tall, medium to thin build, black hair, white and wore thick framed black glasses.  All was great until the 'grab and go' - amazing how one person can negatively impact an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"While a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, it is always fresh and delicious. One of my favorite things is to make a meal with three of the side  vegetables. The eggplant is amazing. The ambiance is fine, but I usually order take out. One minor quibble: I wish they would cut back on the salt. People can always add it back in if salty is their jam."}
{"text":"Well this was a great find for the healthy eaters out there.  Food was fresh, tasty and hot!.  Lemonaids were flavorful and not too sweet or sour.  Had the quiona with slamon, wonderful and a wrap.  Loved them both.  Nice outdoor with misters and indoor seating to fit your mood.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the first time my wife and I had been to Flower Child but are familiar with the other Fox Restaurant Concepts and like them.

We paid $30 for two plates which is common for these restaurants and all options we looked at seemed to be GF, which is awesome. When I asked about the difference between the chicken and the steak add-in's, the register dude asked if I knew the difference between chicken and steak being that one is chicken and the other is steak. I was surprised with his answer and the rest of my stay was weird to say the least. The tables weren't clean, we were pointed around the corner to fetch our silverware and water.

Once we got the food, we were impressed by the portions (Mother Earth Bowl + Chicken and 2 Side bowl + steak). Steak was chewy/fatty but chicken was good. The difference between the chicken and steak included the marinade: steak was slightly spicy and chicken herb-y. The sauce on the Mother Earth was great.

I would go back in the future but would stay away from the steak and asking \"stupid\" questions at the register.

4/5 stars

--UPDATE STARTS BELOW--

My wife and I gave Flower Child a second try and were blown away this visit. Staff was kind and engaging, tables were clean and service was prompt. We also tried some of the GF goodies and loved them!

We will definitely be back in the near future!

5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Needed some tasty vegetables.  Arrived at 6 pm and got in a short line to order.  By the time we sat down, the line was out the door. This place is popular and many call ahead for take out. The breadth and deliciousness of the food menu were awe inspiring. Desserts were packaged and nothing to write home about. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options with a nice layout! 

Location: 44th and Camelback area near the Village. The parking can be problematic during busy, or rather, most times! I often park near the AJs. 

Food: Wow! I love the food here. The healthy options are endless, and meat eaters, vegans, and vegetarians can find foods they enjoy.  Individuals who follow gluten free diets are also happy with the numerous GF options.  

I have eaten here at lunch and dinner.  I usually order the vegetable & grains mix and match.  I have specifically enjoyed the spiced cauliflower, the GF mac and cheese, broccoli, soba noodles, and the sweet potatoes.  The spiced cauliflower is a favorite.  The interesting teas have free refill stations towards the east side of the restaurant. 

The prices are higher than most counter-based service restaurants; however, the food is high quality and healthy. 

Service: The service is OK. It's often crowded, but the food comes out quickly.  I wouldn't say it's overly friendly but not rude either - just average."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food with friendly service and a cheery atmosphere. 

I was so excited that Flower Child opened a second location in Phoenix! 

Parking:  Near AJs - lots of parking available. This is better than the 44th St location where parking is a pain! 

Service: Fantastic! The staff take one's order at the front, then deliver it later. They are friendly and cheery. 

Food: Amaze! I love so many things here.  Recently, I ordered the spicy cauliflower, glazed sweet potatoes, and fruit. The fruit was boring. However, the sweet potatoes are delicious with a sneaky spice, and the cauliflower has a crisp caramelized taste.   The teas and lemonades are interesting and fun to mix together.  The cupcakes / desserts taste fairly fresh.  I have also ordered the hummus, which was creamy and well made.   The recent time, the guy I was with had the pho. I personally would never order pho at FC (only at a true Vietnamese place), but he seemed to like it. 

Atmosphere:  Fun, light with windows everywhere. There are seats outside, and lots of flowering pots outside.  

Cost: The cost is pretty high, but the quality is great. 

I went at 11:30 AM on a Saturday, but at around 1pm, we noted the line was out the door."}
{"text":"I love this place! There are so many healthy options to choose from and they all taste great! My go-to is the Mother Earth Bowl with steak. Their steak is always cooked perfectly medium-rare which I love (it's hard to come across a restaurant that doesn't overcook their beef!). The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that this place is RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED. I get it, healthy, high quality ingredients cost more but this place is over-the-top. The prices are also the only thing preventing me from ordering here regularly."}
{"text":"Food is fine, not bad at all, but the value here is just horrendous. Prepare to spend $15 or so for a small entree salad (with \"protein\") that would cost $5 less at a restaurant with full table service. Lovely space and good enough staff, but not at those prices, thank you."}
{"text":"We stopped in because we love all Fox Restaurant Concepts. In my very personal opinion, I feel this place is highly over priced with tiny portions. I paid $40 for a salad, one of their signature bowls, and two lemonades. We both were given a very small serving of chicken. For that price, I would at least hope to get an entire chicken breast. I would prefer to go to any of the other Fox Concept Restaurants as I have never left those establishments feeling still hungry and poor. 

On a positive note, I enjoyed the vibe of the place. The quinoa bowl I did get was tasty, but definitely needed Sriracha. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love this place, I had such a great time here.  People were nice, food options and food itself were lovely!  I wish they were closer to where I live.  And the soup I had was absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 

I've updated my rating from a 2 star to a 3 star because I recently heard from the restaurant manager at this location, Blake. He apologized for the experience I had and seemed to genuinely want to improve on the shortcomings I experienced on my last visit. I really appreciate the sincere follow up and look forward to giving this location a second chance in the near future (though not on a holiday or peak time). I'm aiming for a quieter time of day next time. Looking forward to trying some of their salads and iced tea, which I had no room for last time. Perhaps in the future I will have more great things to say! Until then, I have upgraded my review from 2 stars to 3 stars as a more neutral rating.

---------------

I wanted to love this place, I wanted to like it better - but it's a challenge after my last visit. The menu at Flower Child is everything I love; so I was psyched it would be awesome! I don't know if it's because I visited on the holiday, quite honestly I wasn't expecting it to be as busy as it was. I mean 4th of July is usually about ribs, wings, beers, and everything you're not supposed to have; maybe we all missed the memo or were just compensating for tonight! 

The food was the best part along with the decor. The worst part was the 15 deep line that was very inefficient at the cash. Not only was the wait long to order your food, finding an indoor table was near impossible. I also got heck from the lady at cash because my table didn't have a number on it, I can't help that the guy who is assigning table numbers skipped over me. 

Staff in general seemed unprepared for the crowd, as many staff members were running around seemly lost in direction and purpose. The kitchen appeared to be running the staff, with no one in charge. Spoons were nearly out, the first one I grabbed was dirty with crusted on food. Waits for the bathrooms were ridiculous. 

The flow of the dining area is not great, it encourages people to constantly barge through the center tables, with strollers and everything knocking your dishes into you. To put it lightly the atmosphere was complete chaos. There is zero privacy the way the dining area is set up, you are literally on top of your neighbor - this also makes the area so loud, that you cannot carry on a conversation without shouting across the table. 

We had ordered a fully vegan lunch, but somehow they made a mistake of giving me sweet corn & quinoa with greek yogurt instead of the red chili glazed sweet potato with bok choy & sesame. I'm still trying to figure out how such a major error was made, since it clearly states on the receipt \"sweet potato\". I would normally go up and have the side mix up corrected, but with such a huge line and people running each way, it was easier just to not bother and who knows how long the wait would be. Sides were ok, nothing stood out as excellent, or anything I would order again. Three Vegetable & Grains \"Mix 'n Match\" sides were $9 and tax, and for the portion size ran far too small. Either portions should be increased or the price brought down to maybe $6 or $7. 

The Whole Grain Wraps Thai Dye for $10 I would say is reasonable and was tasty and came with a simple side salad. The avocado hummus at $7 was delicious but only worth $5, especially if they are going to be skimpy on pita's to dip. Honestly they should have included double the amount of the pitas or some veggies. Yes, I know you can substitute raw veggies for $3, but you shouldn't have to give up the pita for adding $3. The fresh coconuts at $5 were about average price for a restaurant and quite refreshing."}
{"text":"Love this concept and the fresh, quality ingredients. There's lots of seating inside as well as outside on the patio. The prices are a little on the high side, but I think it's worth it. Plus lots of options for vegetarians.

We got the quinoa salad, kale salad with salmon, mac n cheese (gluten free) and olive oil cake. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"So cute.
Such friendly service.
Food does not disappoint.
Atmosphere is earthy, just like the name and the cuisine suggests.
Order the hummus and come back for extra pita (free of charge--and it's warm!)
The Mother Earth bowl had great flavor and adding the chicken filled me up and flattered my taste buds!
Great iced tea selection too.
Overall, wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"One of our go to spots for vegan food. The Mother Bowl is delicious as is the forbidden rice bowl. The Salads are very good too. The Avocado hummus is amazing! Lots of good options for vegetarians and vegans although the tofu lacks seasoning and is very bland. For meat eaters the flying avocado is a must try. My son loves the kids meals so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is was amazing. The portions were perfect size and my son loves sitting on the patio. We didn't have to wait long to order or for our food to come out. Since it was our first visit, the employees were very helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place everything is cooked so beautifully. The food is a little on the pricier side but it is all organic and they use the best ingredients. The salads are amazing and I love just picking a protein of my choice and two sides. The gluten free mac and cheese is awesome too!"}
{"text":"We eat here quite frequently. My husband and I don't mind paying more for organic etc. this is the second time this week that we have been here that my meal has been out before his. Today we waited over 20 minutes for him to get his steak wrap. By the time he got his meal I was completely done with mine. I came to this establishment to share a meal with someone, not to repeatedly eat my meal in front of someone before it gets cold and then wait even longer until he gets his. This has happened several times at this location. We both left today very irritated. Poor customer service every time at this location especially when you tip the people that ring you out. Maybe it is better if you get it to-go."}
{"text":"I came here hungry. Only had a bite of toast all day. I left hungry too.  The chicken wrap has microscopic slivers of chicken in an icky chicken salad wrap.  The steak wrap is fair, I shared with my husband. The price is crazy high. It must come out to $50 a pound. There is maybe 1 oz of chicken in the wrap. .....There is no food.  So if you are on a diet go here with no guilt. If you are starving .....good luck.  I complained so they gave me a sandwich to go.  I opened it when I came home. No food.  My cat had more protein than I.  The ambiance was fair.  The servers were working like slaves.  The drinks are very expensive. No ceiling fans. We are still in a  freakin hot desert. Fox restaurants are poorly designed for the climate. The chair backs are rounded so get ready to keep you purse on the ground. Standing in line is horrible, I had a mother behind me that kept snapping at my heels with her baby carriage. For the price you are getting nothing. We paid over $90 for ZERO food.

The interior design is designer hippie fake.......just like the name. more like a Disney land themed restaurant. They have a yoga Matt basket by the front door, need I say more?  This is just marketing , the food is salty. High in calories, overpriced. The drink station is crowded."}
{"text":"I did a cost analysis of the avocado roll sandwich - I had a hard time finding any chicken so I came in at about .35 cents, this can be yours for a mere 11.00 plus don't forget the tip!!!!. Taco bell has higher food costs.

 In a move of total hypocrisy they use plastic throw away glasses- when I arrived they were carrying huge black sacks of waste to the dumpster, really?  I also looked in to their claim of \"Food Raised- 'Without Additives'....Here is what I found....... 
There is no USDA definition to the term \" No Additives\" anyone using the term may or may NOT be referring to this legal regulation.......No third party regulation.

I'm still upset about my $87.00 lunch that I left hungry and bloated - they use a ton of salt- I'm happy to pay for a good meal - this place is a total sham- the kitchen is NOT Gluten Free, the servers want a tip but all they do is bring the food to the table. No water....then bring the check- why can't FOX pay their employees?- it is an insult to the guests, get it yourself and don't forget to pay my employees wages......
I cannot believe the good reviews I am seeing here- it must be' herd mentality'- the food is not gluten free-not low in salt - not  generous portion, NOT tasty - good for you is questionable as there are more nutrients in romaine than Kale so that s a pile of crap.
If you feel like sitting outside and looking at people go for a coffee....wait- they don't sell coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"Flower child Has great salads... I don't think this is someplace to go if you are big on meat....huge portions....or..heaven forbid, fried food.

I am not a nutritionist but I know enough to say this is clean food, good recipes and insanely well run restaurant.   
The portions can be smallish....the price is not for everyone, $28.00 for 2 salads? 
I do feel a little bad for the employees...why is there a place for a tip on the receipt? You stand in line to order. The table are like a decent food court. You get your own drinks....who am I tipping?  I should tip myself...

On a warm sunny day when you don't want to get stuck forever getting a fattening lunch Flower Child delivers"}
{"text":"Amazing food, many fresh vegetables, grass-fed beef if you eat meat cooked very well. My new healthy spot for after gym or quick healthy meal. Delicious!!! Nice vibe and super clean."}
{"text":"Such a great place with various flavorful dishes. A great selection for those who are vegan and vegetarian. I also enjoy their seasonal lemonade flavors."}
{"text":"This is fresh food... I wish there was one of these where I live. A beverage bar of herbal teas... I couldn't decide what to get... sweet potatoes, quinoa, or corn. There wasn't a table in the whole place and everyone was pleasant and happy. The \"energy\" of this restaurant was contagious. 
I will definitely go out of my way to eat here when I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Flower Child and I ordered Mother Earth with grilled salmon. The flavors are blended so well and was delicious! I ordered it to go but the atmosphere inside looked so quaint and adorable! I will defiantly be back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had lunch here after I did some exhaustive research on places that were more unique than the average lunch spot.  This appeared to fit the profile so we hiked it up here from our hotel.  It is definitely a hike to get here.  

To start with, I can echo the comments that I have seen about the dining area being kind of in disarray.  It's like controlled chaos in terms of ordering and then standing there waiting to be seated.  You have a dozen people behind you and you are kind of standing going \"Hey how ya doin'?\"  It seems like the main complaints here are with the layout and the way they have their system setup.  The food is a 10 but the experience takes it down a notch.  There were too many people going \"WTF?\" 

The flow of the dining area is too scattered.  The tables are stacked on top of each other so there is zero privacy in the dining area.  You are far too uncomfortably close to your neighbors.  People don't want communal dining.  It;s almost impossible to have a conversation and enjoy your personal space.  It was close enough that it looked like I brought a purse even though it was the woman's at the table next to me.

Now as for the food, it was very fresh and we both enjoyed it.  My wife went with the Mother Earth bowl with Salmon.  She had that \"I am happy,\" look on her face so it was a success there.  I went with Thai Dye wrap which was chilled perfectly and hit all the points on the scale of taste, crisp(I added lettuce to it) and spice.  I also grabbed the Simple Hummus as a side and it was some of the best I have had in awhile.  They have the food part down pat.    

We would return to this place. The main advice I would offer is for the ownership to see that the complaints here are more about the way you have designed the ordering process and the way you setup the restaurant.  It's a relatively simple problem to overcome and if you can accomplish that, you will see more 5-star reviews because the food stands on its own."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a while because they have an amazing menu. Gluten free. Cage free eggs and chicken. Amazing food! Very unique & costumer service was great! I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Best food, amazing service and the best ice tea!

I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad. 

The best Arnold palmer ever! Cucumber lemonade with black tea.  Pure heaven!"}
{"text":"Great, self-serve restaurant with lots of tasty options for vegans, vegetarians and omnivores. I recommend the chopped salads."}
{"text":"Great healthy food options with tons of flavor. I've had about 6 things on the menu. All great. KambuCha on tap as well, which is not often found."}
{"text":"Sadly, I think this place may be going downhill. The last five times we've gone the food has been really inconsistent and very salty. 

Tonight I had the forbidden rice bowl with chicken and my stomach has been hurting since we left. I eat this dish a lot and this has happened twice. 

My husband had the cashew quinoa with salmon, as he usually does. But it was so loaded with sauce and salt that the salmon and the quinoa were both ... Soggy! It was slimy and gross to look at. He made himself eat a little and we just left. 

This has been a favorite of ours since moving to Scottsdale from SF. I'm really hoping this review reaches someone who can figure out what's up."}
{"text":"Flower Child is a great option for those who want something healthy yet quick. The thai cashew quinoa bowl was light yet satisfying. I wouldn't say it was very \"thai\" but still delicious. The ambience is quite cute too. Would love to try another bowl or a salad."}
{"text":"My husband who is a real burger guy found the Flying Avocado wrap very satisfying.  The service was over the top excellent for a self serve style set up.  The atmosphere was inviting and comfortable. We will come again."}
{"text":"Super delicious salads. And the vegan cheesecake is absolutely mind blowing. A little pricey for a salad, but you know what I don't mind paying extra not to have a bowl full of lettuce stems. My go to for lunch...kiddo likes it too which is amazing, because she doesn't like anything."}
{"text":"The Avacado toast is a joke. $7 for a store bought 9 grain piece of barely toasted bread with less than a millimeter layer of Avacado and a bit of egg.
The kombucha on tap was forgettable but not bad. 
I left this place very unimpressed and hungry."}
{"text":"Went here with a lunch work date. I enjoyed reading the reviews and was certain there would be food I would love. The menu was full of delicious looking items. I opted for the Thai curry with shredded chicken and a lemon muffin. I think my mouth oo'ed and ahh'ed while I ate. The seasoning was perfect and the portion was perfect, although if it was a bigger portion I would have ate it all. I wasn't in the mood for mindful eating here. 

Next time I'll bring my husband and update my review."}
{"text":"This  place is amazing!!! I had the mother earth bowl with chicken which was so good you would think you were eating guilty food but it's all healthy! They have tons of fresh and interesting lemonade flavors, the plum honey lemonade was divine!!! The interior is so cutr and they have a great patio area with heaters. I was just visiting but if I lived here I'd be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick sit down late dinner. I wasn't sure what to expect. The atmosphere was very nice. The staff wasn't authentically friendly but I contributed it to my late arrival (8:40 pm they close at 9). Hopefully it'll be better next time. Good customer service is important. It adds to the ambiance. Nevertheless, the food was great. I had the Forbidden Rice w/chicken."}
{"text":"Child friendly plates available as well as vegan options. The is healthy menu fare as well for those that do eat meat so that it isn't just a 'vegan or else' place that forces one part of the group to be happy or the other one. Many good options for drinks as well including three unsweetened teas and three lemonade choices as well. Definitely recommend if your group has both meat and no meat needs."}
{"text":"I love Flower Child. I always get their forbidden rice with grass fed steak and it's enough to share with someone else. Everything I've had here has always been good and if you ever want to eat healthy, stop by. It's a little pricy to me for a quick order at the counter place but I think definitely worth it."}
{"text":"All of me loves all of Flower Child! 

Last night, I really wanted to eat somewhere healthy and that my mom would love (she is pretty picky) so I hoped that Flower Child was the answer and it was!!

We came last night and the restaurant is pretty open, big and similar to the Sauce concept - you wait in line to order at the counter, get a number while you get your drinks, sit and they bring your order to you.

We ordered the Avocado Hummus, the Rebel Wrap, and the Forbidden Rice bowl with shaved chicken = less than $40. We received the hummus first which included pita bread. I wasn't a big fan of it because the pita bread was thin and flimsy and the hummus was alright. I don't think it was worth $7. However, the forbidden rice and rebel wrap were delicious! I think that the portions weren't bad - two entrees and one appetizer filled three people. 

I noticed their iced teas and lemonades after we ordered and was considering going back in line to just get a drink. However, after eating our food, I just knew I would be a regular here so I decided to hold off and get an iced tea the next time I dine in. My mom and hubby loved the food too. 

The next morning, we placed a to-go breakfast order for the Late Riser and the Green Garden bowls  = a little over $20. It was so filling and appetizing! My favorite was the Green Garden - scrambled eggs, spinach, roasted brussels sprouts, broccoli, charred onion, tuscan kale pesto,
greek yogurt, prairie breeze cheddar! I was quite impressed that all those greens can be included in a bowl and be so good!"}
{"text":"Been goin to the one in santa monica
Was really excited when they opened it in las vegas 
It's exactly the same quality 
Super fresh food
So yum ! And healthy ! Just like a meal prep 
Made fresh for you in a restaurants vibe or take home and enjoy 
5 stars"}
{"text":"Food tastes ok, but $13 for a tofu bowl that is literally 7 bites is a complete ripoff.  The portions are incredibly tiny.  Go here if you're rich and on a diet!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times since they opened and every experience has been wonderful! Since my diet is restrictive, it makes dining out a bit difficult, but the way the menu is set up makes it very easy for me to figure out what I can and cannot have. Plus, everything tastes so delicious! The avocado hummus is amazing!   And the sweet potatoes...oh the sweet potatoes, I love them so much! And the staff is always attentive and friendly without being overbearing! Can't wait to go back...hmm, now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Fast efficient excellent customer service. Food excellent. Best vegan food I've been served in a restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for the first time. Food was so reasonably priced and so tasty. The manager came over and gave us cookies since he thought some things were taking too long. We were very surprised since we never complained and all our food came in 10 minutes. The service is truly amazing and everyone is super friendly. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I passed Flower Child everyday on my way to work. On one of my days off I decided to finally give it a shot for lunch. So glad I gave it a shot, because now its one of my favorite places to go. I love the cute decor and all the employees excel with customer service. I always get the vegan mac & cheese, red chili glazed sweet potatoes and grilled chicken. The sweet potatoes are probably my absolute favorite, I'm even salivating as I type this. 
Yuuuuuum!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place last night and I loved it. Everything from the environment to the fresh juices/food was great. It can get pricey but it's a great place to eat when you're looking to eat healthy! I'm looking forward to trying out their breakfast selections next"}
{"text":"I think this place absolutely nailed it on food, service, atmosphere and decor! I would expect nothing less from FRC - but that also includes the higher price. My personal fave is the Forbidden Rice Bowl - to which a protein can be added - I get the sliced chicken. Add in one of their amazing lemonades, and you are already at $20 for a lunch - a pricey meal, but a filling & healthy one. I would definitely recommend this and will continue to frequent this place, however the price may be off-putting to some."}
{"text":"I got takeout from this restaurant, so can't comment on the decor or service. The forbidden rice with chicken dish, however, was absolutely delicious! The only reason I docked a star was that I was hungry again an hour later - next time I will order a side dish or salad as well, but the price of the rice bowl alone should have kept me full for a while."}
{"text":"Flower Child is a vegetarian's delight-  there are so many creative, healthy options full of fresh ingredients! (But you can add meat to any of the dishes, and some come with meat, so there is no need for meat eaters to stay away.) I've been to Flower Child several times, and have never been disappointed. 

My current favorite is the Vietnamese Crunch salad, but I also like the Chopped Vegetable. Both are well-portioned and combine great flavors and textures. The Mother Earth bowl is also delicious if you are looking for something a little more cozy and filling, and I like the Forbidden Rice bowl as well.

The decor is airy, cute, and comfortable. I love sitting on the patio, where there are several small tables and lots of greenery and flowers. 

You can also order food for pick-up online, which is super convenient. Just put in your order, pay for it, and pick it up at the register by the deli case :)"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot! Such great salads, protein bowls and wraps. I went with a group of 6 people on two separate occasions.

In  terms of salads, the grains and greens salad was the favorite.  

I got the flying avocado wrap on one occasion and it was really great too. The wraps are freshly made and the avocado spread is great. 

They have a side dish of corn and it is really tasty, resembling the flavors of corn soufflé. 

The teas and lemonades are also all great! I tried a bunch of flavors and even mixed. The mango iced tea is my favorite. Next time, I want to try the avacado hummus!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything I've tried so far on the menu is delicious. I really LOVE their salmon, super fresh and very good. I always get their vegan mac and cheese and it's so rich in flavor. I also get the sesame seed sweet potatoes and man are those to die for! Super flavorful! I also really like how everything is healthy as well, I don't feel as guilty eating! Will come again whenever I'm nearby!"}
{"text":"In love with the food! Service is courteous and friendly. Have never had a bad experience. Their wraps are amazing... And are homemade. Kombucha on tap...yum! It gets extremely busy at the noon hour. The brownies are so good and you don't feel guilty eating them because the are made with organic ingredients."}
{"text":"I always love the food here. One of my favorite places to eat. The sweet corn and quinoa side is amazingggg. I also love one of their wraps called The Rebel. It has grass fed steak,
Charred onion and port salut (one of my fave cheeses). I wish they would open one near me (Chandler). That's the only thing about FRC they never open any down this way all they have is Sauce and then Zinburger in Gilbert."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, and love that it's counter service so you can hang out as long as you like. Menu is like Chop Shop or True Food - casual and healthy. Love the iced tea and lemonade bar - I like to mix flavors :) There is sometimes a long line but it moves quickly. And the gluten free desserts? To die for."}
{"text":"Not too fond of their prices as two entrees can easily add up to roughly 30 bucks but it's so worth it considering they know how to prepare their food with quality taste. I ordered their Thai dye and it tasted exactly like an authentic spring roll. Their tofu was very firm and it complemented the wrap very well. Not only that, but the way they seasoned the tofu as well made it all the better! Also a bonus that the area it is located at has a very cute and dainty feel to it, being surrounded by flowers and plants. Definitely a place to go to get your health fix!"}
{"text":"Good food but the portions are too small for the price. The curry bowl is good but I think my kids got larger portions on their kids meals! I Like the pick 3 sides when I'm not starving, and for around $10. Line is always crazy long!! Wish they upped the portion size for what you pay to eat there."}
{"text":"Love this place and would definitely recommend this place! Just great healthy choices and you can truly taste the goodness"}
{"text":"Get the avocado hummus! And sweet quinoa corn! Absolutely the best. Love the vibes and ambiance too. Couldn't be happier that they have added a location to this side of town!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor are wonderful!! 
I tried the Mac & cheese, beef bowl and flying avocado wrap. Everything was tasty but the flying avocado was by far the best. I will be back for that soon!"}
{"text":"Perfect for people who like natural, wholesome, organic food! Not my cup of tea, as I enjoy a more wholesome fulfilling heavier meal. Located in the uptown plaza, makes it nice if everyone in your party isn't convinced, options are nearby."}
{"text":"OK, I admit, there's a little prejudice against FC on my part even before I walk in the door. Between it and Steak 44, my mellow corner AJ's is a mere memory. Parking/traffic is now a total pain the ass.

That said, I thought I'd give it a whirl for lunch today on my day off. I had to make a full circle through the lot before finding a single space. Walking up, I could already hear the buzz of way too many overly excited female voices. Ruh roh. The line stretched well out the door, but it did move quickly. Employees are stationed at the doorway before the registers to answer questions, a nice touch. Said helpful girl directed me to a little side register devoted to take out. 

To (ahem) ensure my experience was representative, I splurged for the 3-item mix + match, a big ol' drink, and a brownie (after sampling one at the register). $23.... ouch. I had elbows-out trying to get through the crowd to the drink station (ice teas, lemonades, etc.). Predictable mix of ladies-who-lunch, hipsters, soccer moms, fashionistas in leather shirts and $2000 handbags. Female:male ratio easily 4:1, if not higher. The decor is a little whitewashed-Midwestern-barn-chic for my taste, but it fits the name. It's quite open so the place is LOUD AS FUCK. 

I barely had a chance to get comfy on the big benches in the takeaway area before my food was ready, presented in a brown paper bag with a cute artichoke stamped on it, a takeout menu thoughtfully placed inside. I'd just finished checking out the cooler with to-go drinks, mentally scoffing at the $6 cold brew coffee and envisioning the idiot who would think it's cool to drink coconut water right out of the coconut. I fled the scene, trying not to step on wayward children, and hurried to my car as someone in a big SUV stalked me for my space. 

The verdict? Meh. The dark greens were very salty. VERY. The chili glazed sweet potato was decent, with an unexpected pronounced citrus flavor. Not spicy in the least. The tofu... well, it is tofu. Definitely nothing special. The clear winner was the sweet corn and quinoa. My God. Strap a feed bag on me full of that shit and I'll be good. The portions are not as dismal as one might suspect from other reviews; this will be two meals. The brownie was puzzling; different from the one I'd sampled earlier, although I'd ordered the same type. The one that came home with me was, again, heavily salted. Not bad, just not expected.

While I'm impressed by the efficiency of a restaurant that is so new, I'm not blown away by the food itself. Regardless, I suspect I will end up here often, because a) it's walking distance from my house; b) lots of vegetarian options; and c) easy for takeout."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great date night idea for those who are plant eaters

Always order the mother earth bowl and wine"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and such a cute setting! Loved our food and happy to find such a fun place to enjoy great vegan food."}
{"text":"To put it simply, this place is delicious, and it's good to know you're putting healthy food into your body. 

Went here for the first time a week ago and will definitely be going back. I got the flying avocado wrap. It was fantastic. Great flavor for something so simple. I was able to try a bite of their red chili glazed sweet potato side from a friend and it was genius to put those flavors/spices together! 

Our guests visiting from out of town returned for a 2nd visit because they thought the food was so good and fresh. They highly recommended the mac n cheese. 

The price seems slightly steep, but now that I know I'm getting good food, I can be okay with it. Also, their service was pretty quick. Great, fresh, and clean atmosphere. Upbeat. 

If you're looking for something on the healthier side that has variety, give this place a shot! For being a Fox Restaurant Concept, this place has the BEST food out of the ones I have been to."}
{"text":"Healthy eats and fresh ingredients. Definitely coming back to try different variations of the available menu. Great concept"}
{"text":"Although I love me some Strawberry Fields Salad season, today I was pretty disappointed. To pay $13 (Salad + chicken protein) it sure is a sad looking Salad. I can see the bottom of the black container."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try Flower Child for lunch. The restaurant is really nice and the people are wonderful. I had the chopped vegetable salad with salmon. This might be the best salad I've ever had. The salmon and dressing were absolutely delicious. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Some changes to the menu from the other location.  Nice new location, easy access, great service and food. I tried the Asian Noodle salad w avocado and mint. Loved it.  I added steak, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great customer service but bad bang for the buck. Always end up hungry after an hour of eating here. The lemonade is the best!"}
{"text":"What a cool concept for a restaurant! My family and I were on vacation in Phoenix and we came here two nights in a row because it was that good. The majority of us got the Earth Bowl each time and it's one of the most interesting, tastiest dishes I've had in a while. Very reasonably priced and quick service. I can't wait for them to expand across all of America!"}
{"text":"The food is delish here! I always feel amazing after eating here. I really wish they would move out to Queen Creek. I'd go there weekly!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. Typical for the area that's it's in.. the food was bland and the beer was just ok.. not interested in second try, all FRC are all the same.. hard pass!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great for meeting friends or taking the family to. There are so many great combinations of food. The menu is simple yet it leaves you with an abundance of options. You order at the counter up front, pay and take your number to any table. They'll bring the food to you. Service is quick and they are keen on removing plates that you've set aside. They offer a wide variety of delicious self serve lemonades. I honestly believe they serve some of the best in the valley. I had a watermelon pomegranate one. Food is fantastic. I had the flying avocado wrap this time which was huge and delicious. I loved the shaved grilled chicken on the inside. I ordered a side of spicy Japanese eggplant. I almost inhaled the plate because it was so yummy. I would probably have to come here over 100 times to try the various combos they offer. Great service and food. Of course I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place I wish they would open a location in North Phx!!"}
{"text":"Finally on this side of town and I get to enjoy this new and amazing restaurant, and I knew it was amazing before I went. It is intuition of course. The restaurant was very welcoming like the sort of atmosphere that you would go to moms and have dinner after being away for a while. The service here is stellar and so is the restaurant itself! The chairs and tables are so quaint and homey. 

I ended up ordering the chopped veggies salad and the strawberry fields salad. For only $8 the portions are so large. I spilt two salads between myself and my twins, with extra left over. We also ordered the side orders simply sautéed broccoli. The broccoli sides were done to perfect and everything was so fresh. My favorite was the strawberry fields salad the strawberries were fresh and I paired it with a NV IPA beer. Magnificent is all that resonates with this hot new business!"}
{"text":"So good! I have been to the Arcadia location before & this location is just as great. I needed a quick lunch while waiting at the hospital across the street & I noticed a Flower Child. Perfect. I ordered the Mediterranean Salad (+ chicken) to go & it was ready within 10 minutes. Its a little pricey (total $14) & not very big. But so tasty."}
{"text":"I came to Flower Child with a friend for the first time and we loved it! First of all, great vibes. Fresh, clean, bright, busy-  but not overly crowded. Phoenix becomes a better place every time Sam Fox opens a new restaurant. 

We shared the avocado hummus which was fantastic. I had the beets, sweet potatoes, and a side of chicken for protein. I was OBSESSED with the beets and sweet potatoes. The chicken was plain grilled, but with some hummus and Cholula it was just right. Lemonade was great as well, especially since you can mix and match to make your own Arnold Palmer. Definitely will be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Flower Child couldn't be any cooler if it tried-- if I wasn't such a healthy eater already it would've converted me immediately. 

It's an open space, high ceilings, light and airy colors and booths- lots of booths, stripes, paisley and pillows. 

   Fresh lemonade are by the utensils and the menu is not incredibly expansive but a little overwhelming for a first time. The perks? Staff is SUPER friendly and talkative. When I geeked out over the fact that they have synergy kombucha ON TAP like a draft, she joined in. It was fantastic. 
      Not only do they have that but they also offer teas, mini coffee growlers, coconut water, hummus grab n goes and baked goods in and near the deli case. 

   Dinner was unreal. I did the vegetable and grains platter but couldn't pick just three so I got four different things. The portions are great sizes, i didn't feel like I was stuffed or that I had over eaten. 
   I tried their beets, avocado and citrus side, the Indian cauliflower with turmeric and cinnamon, the quinoa tabbouleh and the sweet chile glazed sweet potatoes.
Everything was amazing and my obsession with sweet potatoes has only deepened after this amazing preparation. 

     We got the avocado hummus to split and it was excellent-- it has pumpkin seeds with it which gives it a nice texture and flavor variation. 

All in all, I wish I lived next door to this little hippie."}
{"text":"We need more restaurants like this in the valley!! Ordered take out on a Saturday, just before noon, due to how busy the restaurant  was. I had the chicken wrap and it did not disappoint; it was full of flavor and just simply delicious. I also had the soup of the day which happened to be tortilla, I may skip this addition if it's offered to me next time, I received 1 sliver of chicken and the soup lacked salt. Despite the bland soup, the chicken wrap was so good that the meal still gets 5 stars. There are so many options & combinations. I cannot wait to try the entire guilt-free menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went here twice for lunch and love every meal that I had.

The food was super yummy healthy, the staffs were so nice and the decor is so lovely. The patio is nice too, but you don't want to sit outside when it's 95f'+ because it's hot. But during the cooler season it's so nice. I will definitely will come back and bring friends to this place."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. It has so many vegan options that I should be in heaven! But, every time I try it, I walk away with \"meh\" on my mind. It's not that I don't like it - I just don't love it.

Two visits ago I had the Thai Dye, which is a wrap with tofu and veggies. The flavor was just okay, and it was an absolute mess to eat. It fell apart and the sauce was very sticky. I needed a wet nap. 

On my most recent visit I got the Forbidden Rice Bowl, with added tofu. Again, it was fine, but it wasn't fantastic. The rice was flavorful and firm, the veggies were cooked well, etc. There was a very light red chili hoisin flavor - nothing too distinct but not offensive. I liked how thinly sliced the carrots and other veggies were, and it was a decent sized serving - enough for two meals for me. However, the tofu was just a block of sliced baked tofu with no flavor. It wasn't marinated or mixed in with the food. It would have been better if it was sauteed with the bowl ingredients rather than just placed on top. 

My friend got two portions of the mac and cheese (not vegan) and seemed to enjoy it. She finished it off.

The service was fine and I didn't have to wait to order at the counter, but the atmosphere at Flower Child is what I'll call \"high energy\" - very loud, crowded and busy. It's not a good place for a lunchtime conversation, and certainly not some place I can bring my extended family to since we wouldn't be able to hear each other. It's great for a quick healthy bite, but not a mainstay in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Everyone who works there is awesome and they have flavored water while you wait and the food is VERY flavorful!!! I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine and I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorites places to eat. Everything is delicious. Could eatbthere everyday. Super great employees. My only complaint is that portions are small."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the restaurant very much. Had the beef barley soup and the Cobb salad - both were excellent. Well run system for seating even though it was busy, and the place has a fun atmosphere. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in all of Phx & Scottsdale. Delicious and truly healthy options for everyone. At least once a week is necessary."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this placefor a healthy, but super tasty option. Met up with my friend there today for lunch because I needed something light and tasty, but healthy options. 

The parking Judy the best during lunch - super packed.  The decor is super cute, almost retro looking, plenty of space with indoor and outdoor seating. Is the kind of restaurant where you order and pay, take a number to your seat and wait for it to be brought to you.  The menu is a tad overwhelming, so I had to ask the lady at the cash register where you order how it works. At first she looked at me crazy as if to say \"how do you not know?!\" But in the end she was helpful. I created my own plate with chicken, sweet potato, Brussel sprouts and avocado. That came up to $15.20. A little pricey, but I wasn't going to not get it after I ordered it. 

 It took a bit for the food to get to us, and when it came my first thought was \"oh that is SO cute! Omg that looks tasty!\" My tummy actually rumbled because they bro ight my friend's food first and I was so hungry. When mine came and I put the first sprout in my mouth, I almost started crying. Y'all everything on that plate was SO UNBELIEVABLY TASTY! Great portion sizes, everything was seasoned to perfection! If it wasn't so expensive, I would seriously eat there every day!"}
{"text":"Flower Child is by far one of the best restaurants when you need a quick and healthy meal. I frequently visit this location and fall in love with it more and more each time. The kale salad, macaroni & cheese, and tomato & watermelon salad are among my favorites. 

Each time I visit, whether dine-in or take-out, the visit is pleasant and the employees are phenomenal. This was especially displayed in my most recent visit when I paid for my meal with a gift card, however there was a mistake with the register that said I owed $6 extra dollars, which was incorrect. After much confusion and trying to figure out the issue, the sweet girl at the register determined that Flower Child was at fault and refunded the necessary money, as well as gave me a free kombucha! This restaurant goes above and beyond for customer service and their food is the best in the area. I will continue to recommend this place to everyone I meet and will be back often!"}
{"text":"We are Vegetarian and this restaurant grills their tofu on a non-cleaned grill that was just used for Meat.  We watched them remove some sort of rack of meat and then immediately place our tofu in the same spot on their grill.  We were really upset and called over the manager.  She said \"sorry there is only one small grill so we can't have a special spot for Tofu\".

That means their tofu is all cooked in meat grease and is not vegetarian nor vegan.  If you eat their tofu, you're eating meat fat :("}
{"text":"The food here is amazing I highly recommend, i had the Flying Avacado wrap with some Rose Peddle Lemonade, it was delicious, the staff is very friendly, the environment and vibe is on point. I love the open kitchen they have so you can see that everything is clean and fresh and it's just cool to watch them in action preparing your food! Definitely stop in if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Flower Child twice now and been impressed both times. 
The first time I ordered the kale salad and added salmon. It was absolutely delicious. Everything was so fresh, it wasn't overloaded with dressing, and the salmon was cooked to perfection. It was a perfect combo.

The second time I ordered the sweet potatoes, corn & quinoa and salmon again since it was so good the first time. This dish was also really delicious. The salmon is flavorful, juicy and not fishy at all. The sweet potatoes are cooked just right - soft but not mushy and seasoned really well. The corn & quinoa is my new favorite thing. I need to figure out how to make this at home!

Some people complain that the portions are small but I think they are just right. Most restaurants serve portions that are way too big. I'm willing to pay more for healthy, responsibly sourced food and I'm okay if that means the portions are smaller. Flower Child makes it easy to eat well. I just wish I lived closer so I could go there more often!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy food place. The service is always prompt. They aim to please. The last time I was here the horseradish yogurt dressing was not ready for the Rebel wrap. I waited and started without it. It was not ready when I finished. Because of that the manager bought me out another wrap to go. Servers are always kind and go out of their way to please."}
{"text":"Last night, I was there anticipating a nice gathering based on all the other reviews. Well, I think it is called Flower Child because we need to be on happy pills from the 60's to mind NOT waiting in line forever just to place an order. Then if you decide later to try the raved on brownies, be prepared to stand in line AGAIN for another 15 minutes just to get pre-wrapped brownies (which were dee-lish).  The food was ok and cold. The servers were all very young and pleasant. The smashed potatoes praises must be from people who never cook or ever made mashed potatoes??  Three of us at the table said the smashed potatoes were oversalted.. Bring your smart phone with games to play while waiting in line to order at busy times and waiting for the delivery to the table. Definitely don't forget anything or you will be condemned to another LONG wait in the line.  What ever happened to table service? Rather pricey for serve yourself dining."}
{"text":"Salads were delicious.  However there is no handicap parking and was very busy when I was there and had to park far from entrance.  Was difficult to walk the distance using crutches."}
{"text":"So different and delicious! I can't wait to come back. The menu has plenty to choose from and adding proteins is becoming my favorite trend these days. Don't be scared. Just eat and become a fan."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to be invited to the pre-opening. Flower Child is all about healthy food, but the place brings flavor, freshness, eye appeal and friendliness to the next level. Had the Med Quinoa salad with perfectly cooked, moist salmon ~ maybe a bit over-dressed but that's 100% on me for forgetting to ask for it on the side as I usually do. With a glass of Rose and a lemon cupcake the lunch felt guilt-free and decadent at the same time. Decor and service? Fabulous too."}
{"text":"Tough to find value. I stopped by Saturday night with friends and we just had time for take out. I had the Broccoli and Parmesan, Kale and Apple Slaw, and the grass fed steak as the protein. The meal tasted great but the portions weren't worth the $16 after tax cost. I had a feeling when I was handed the bag and it was very light. I would only go back at those prices to dine in for a special occasion. 

My feedback is to have take out specials ($10 for two items and protein for example) I would stop by then at least a couple times a week. Especially when I want a healthy light meal after working out. I'm sure the ingredients are top quality but it's just too much money for such a small meal and the take out customers pay for dine in atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm in love. I have been wanting to eat at flower child's for so long and I finally got the chance today. I ordered on recommendation from a friend, the Mother Earth bowl with added salmon and it. Was. So. Delicious. There was so many flavors. I also ordered the daily juice! Was expecting to be impressed and I was more than impressed and just so happy with my meal. Wish I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"Went there on Tuesday Sept. 27, 2016. Great place and awesome food. We were welcomed in as soon as we got in. I ordered Mother Earth, I loved that dish and made me feel satisfied and filled without the guilt. As for my Drink, I ordered GT's Trilogy Kombucha and it was okay, nothing major just tasty, refreshing and tasty. For me, it was  bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Recently in town visiting family. My mom, cousin, and I thought we would try for lunch.  My mother and I both had the Quinoa power bowl. My cousin had the side of gluten free mac and cheese and the chicken avocado wrap. We all enjoyed our meals. Great staff, location, food, and atmosphere. I will return my next trip back to Phx"}
{"text":"My favorite organic food in AZ!
Love, love, love the organic lemon cakes! And the drink selection is perfect"}
{"text":"Whenever I am home in Scottsdale, my parents and I always go to Flower Child. Everything that I have tried has been delicious. My favorites are the sweet corn and quinoa, flying avocado wrap, and the forbidden rice. Price is a little high for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"All salads tasted pretty good. Service top notch. However the portion size and price for what you get leaves me no choice but 2 stars. I felt violated after my four dollar soda and 13 dollar bite sized salad."}
{"text":"Flower Child hit the spot today. I had a chopped salad with tofu. My friends had the strawberry salad with chicken and brownie and lemon cake. My salad was perfectly dressed - meaning it had just enough dressing to cover it. For most, it might seem a bit under-dressed, but I like mine that way. I wasn't a fan of the avocado dressing, but it wasn't bad. I might try a different dressing next time. 

The only reason I didn't give a five star is because for $4, I got probably 3 oz of tofu, which isn't a lot. I had to pay $8 to tofu... and that seems a bit outrageous, considering 18oz of organic tofu cost less than $2. So, my salad cost $16 for a regular bowl due to the double tofu. I could go to Wolfgang pucks and get an amazing salad for $20 with wild salmon on the side. At Flower Child, if I had gotten a side of salmon, it would have cost $15 which is less than what I paid with double tofu. Even if they had to grill it. There really isn't much to do. It's a better deal for salad if you don't get tofu and get chicken or something else. 

Otherwise, I think this is a great place. Everything seemed fresh, and the staff were super friendly. I'd go back, but would make  different selection."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm impressed! Visiting my parents in Phoenix/ Scottsdale I'm often disappointed by the so-so food in the area. Then I found flower child. Kale salad = best one I've ever had (even better than True Food, which I love). The wraps are also divine. The drinks and deserts wonderful as well. A perfect ambiance to boot. I'm in love!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I even begin? The decor, the atmosphere, the friendly faces, the yummy food, the fresh teas and juices, the clean bathroom, the outdoor seating...the list goes on and on. What a well done restaurant! The attention to detail and thought that went into this place is incredible. 

Okay, let me be more specific. You are greater with fruit infused water as you walk into this airy, organic vortex. Fresh flowers peppered all over the place. I ordered the mix and match consisting of sweet corn and quinoa, sweet potatoes, and the beat, avocado, and citrus salad. A world tour for my pallet! Everything was distinctly different, and uniquely great tasting! I tried the green tea, and also had a taste of the lemonade. Both were a ten. 

I cannot wait for my next meal here! This is by far the BEST Fox restaurant so far. Wow. Just wow."}
{"text":"A hippie at heart, the name of this place called my name. I was pleased to find the food was also very delicious. Quality food is often pricier but they put a lot of thought into their dishes which makes it worth it, I got the Hippie Chick wrap and it was very good."}
{"text":"Quinoa bowl is delish! It looks small but ends up being a good serving size. Most entrees are vegetarian but you have the option to add on chicken, beef, or a side salad, etc. 

This is a counter service place where you order at a central spot, take a number, and wait staff brings your food. Ordering is similar to N'Counter in Tempe. This type of concept leads to lower prices overall, but add- ons can add up. 

Overall a fun, trendy place to get an inexpensive, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Not to say the food isn't good. But the menu is confusing and you have to order upfront with a line of people behind you so you don't have time to really ask questions. Then when I said what I wanted thinking it was a dinner being it's labeled at \"plates\" she said that's it? Didn't even tr y to explain how the menu works. They do have many gluten free, vegetarian, vegan options. Sugar free and dairy free. I'll just say I am never coming back here."}
{"text":"Flower child has many great, healthy options for all dietary needs. The skinny Cobb salad is always so fresh and delicious. They also carry Jun honey kombucha on tap, which is my favorite. I love the fact that they have fresh healthy food fast. I really enjoy coming here and bring many of my friends and family here for lunch. I only wish they'd put the late riser on their menu at this location. Price point is a little high but it can kind of be expected when paying for premium quality ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want real fresh and organic food. Made to order, hot food. My fiancé (who is vegan) and I love coming here for brunch and for the greenery. I enjoy their house made fresh drinks. You have to try! Really take a look at the menu since there is so much to choose from, you'll probably end up trying everything by the many times you'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have had this restaurant bookmarked for forever but since I am never on this side of town, it has stayed tucked away waiting for the perfect moment! And that moment was tonight! I am so pleased with this place! Decor is stunning & inviting all at once. Casual and upbeat. The food was very pure, I ordered two sides, I know not very adventurous. I got the gluten free mac & cheese and the chicken. The girl at the counter was very helpful in answering my questions and making suggestions on what I should try. The food did not disappoint & I am honestly already thinking about that Mac & cheese! I will be back to try more whenever I find myself on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Right of the bat, I loved the atmosphere very open and inviting, many windows, and seating areas. 

Food also good with a sold selections of healthy options and the ability to customize your plate the way you like it. Anywhere from macaroni and cheese to eggplants. A Sold selections of Vegan people. 

I had a plate with 3 sides, Smashed Organic Potato, Spicy Japanese Eggplant, and Gluten-Free Mac & Cheese with chicken. This companion of different flavors on my plate was amazing. I felt like I was getting little of everything. The plate was big enough to fill most people without a problem, yet I found the cost of adding chicken was little on the expensive side($5 extra).

The line can get longer than I'd like specially when it's lunch hours, I also experienced a very long delay in one of my side orders, and no one even acknowledge the delay.  

All in all, I would be coming back to try new flavorful dishes as soon as I get a chance. I thought the miner problem I had with my experience was not a common problem and I just happened to be that person."}
{"text":"I had to circle the lot to find a spot there was so ch a crowd visiting Flower Child. Stepping inside I was instantly put at ease. How cool! Walking in felt like I was in a Local Co-op. Ordering was easy. We got our number and sat outside under the covered patio. Hardly any time passed and our food arrived.

I was a little trepidatious about the menu as I've rarely had a great vegetarian meal, this one was awesome. We split a pair of bowls. We had the Forbidden Rice and the Thai Cashew Quinoa. Both were delicious. The Forbidden Rice had a great flavor with the soy sauce balancing out the textures and flavors.

The Thai Cashew Quinoa had a little bit of heat, make sure you have the water ready. All the bowls were awesome. My only regret was that the bowls weren't bigger. I may have to add some protein next time I'm there."}
{"text":"This place just plain rocks. Healthy options galore, gluten free and vegan options AND Brew Dr. Kombucha! Stop reading this review and get down here."}
{"text":"Oh, how I adore you flower child. The food is so fresh, clean and full of flavor. Lots of excellent vegetarian options and a cute ambiance. If you're looking for something healthy that's also delicious with plenty of options, stop here. I love all of the salads and a favorite side is the Japanese eggplant."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch spot. I went there for the first time earlier this week and the food was amazing. I had the grass fed steak, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and corn quinoa. It was so delicious.I live near this location but wish there was one out in Mesa or Gilbert area near my work!"}
{"text":"This is my first trip to a flower child restaurant. They offer a gluten-free menu with so much variety in flavor. I had a Thai cashew quinoa bowl with chicken. Also ordered the eggplant and potatoes to share with a friend. The flavor is amazing! The price is decent and the Decour could not be any more adorable. I seriously want my house decorated the way this restaurant is. Even the tile work is amazing they thought of every little detail to make this seem like a cozy little restaurant. They beverages they offer are also fresh made and super delicious. I got the passion fruit lemonade and it was amazing. For my refill I got some of the tea varieties that they have and that was also very good. I will definitely go back to this restaurant on my next visit to this area of Arizona."}
{"text":"Tons of gluten-free options and yummy flavor combinations!  I ordered the quinoa thai bowl and added salmon.  It's delicious!  Salmon is cooked perfectly!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can I say yum!! I swear I looked at the menu for a good 5 minutes because everything sounded amazing. Salad was great, the wrap even better! They have so many teas to pick from, I can't say more about this establishment other than it's a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Since Flowerchild is a Fox restaurant, you know it will be good! One of my favorite things about this place is that you can mix and match your protein and sides. I recommend ordering the sweet corn and quinoa as a side. It's delicious. The reason I ranked it 4 stars is because the last time I went, my mashed potatoes were cold. They normally have good mashed potatoes too, but for some reason, they had difficulty keeping them hot."}
{"text":"I found this place to be trendy with a side of snobbery. Food is pretty good and expensive, $15 for a bowl with protein. Lots of moms lunch here in their lululemon outfits and big fat sparkling diamonds and huge Michael Kors bags. 

It was my first visit and the order taker at the counter was not helpful at all with the ordering process nor was she able to offer guidance on what is good etc. 

Anyway this place is just meh."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are extremely friendly. The food is to die for! My husband lacks culinary skills so when it's his day to cook---he dials Flower Child for takeout instead. Healthy never tasted better!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's a very well put together menu with all levels of healthiness, sizes, vegan & vegetarian, etc. My go to is the Flying Avacado but if I'm real hungry I love doing one of their various 2-3 item meals w/ choice of protein. The selection is beautifully minimalistic and for good reason, with these well known delights, the staff in the kitchen really make their ingredients shine (it's kind of funny they share a wall with Jimmy John's). 

Not only do they have amazing food (which is available for take out btw) but their speciality cold teas, lemonades and other drinks are the most refreshing things I have ever tasted. 

Also this place is GREAT for going in and having a meal and reading or going on a date, the decor is really gorgeous to say the least. Make sure you try out this little sister to Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Very healthy and tastes really good. Everyone who works here is very nice and my order is always perfect every time. I've been here over a dozen times and I'm never disappointed. Hoping they open a location in the east valley soon."}
{"text":"If we were going off my personal opinion on the taste of food alone, I would probably only designate four stars.  BUT, this is the only place where the kid meal comes with broccoli (or roasted veggies, kale/apple slaw, you get to decide...).  If I cook broccoli sprinkled with Parmesan at home, my kids will push it around on their plate.  But at Flower Child, I caught them fighting over the last piece of broccoli.  So Bravo, Flower Child. Nicely done.

I took my husband here as well and he got the Flying Avocado, which is a burrito with avocado. But it's not like a mammoth man-size Chipotle burrito, it is a normal burrito, representing a generous yet practical and digestible serving size.

I appreciate the lack of fried food and a fresh option outside of the AJ's salad bar. Because lets face it, AJ's is cool but their salad bar is no Whole Foods, except in price.

The only thing I do not like about the chicken-nugget-less kid meals are the enormous drinking cups that they come with.  The options for filling these cups (outside of water) are a variety of teas (caffeine!) and lemonades (sugar!)  Everything in moderation so I recommend watering down the lemonade for kids, and maybe even adults, if you do not like things coyingly sweet.

What I wanted to touch on (because I doubt anyone else will take it there) is the bathroom mirrors.  I am not saying they are bad, or saying they are good, I am just saying that it is always an interesting sight to be facing a full length mirror while you use the restroom.  My daughter was especially intrigued by this and very determined to watch herself go in as many ways as possible.  

So far I have tried the steak, pho, and a variety of side dishes - everything is tasty and if my man-size-burrito loving husband enjoyed it, I would say there is something there for any type of eater.  Except for those who only eat french fries."}
{"text":"Delicious clean food ! And you must get a cup for the ice tea / lemonade bar ! Yum ! Good for vegetarians and meat eaters .. Will def be back !"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!! Healthy, but good healthy food!! Customer service is great too!!"}
{"text":"Remarkable dishes. Fantastic environment. Servers need work learning to smile and to not bring you dirty plates. Plate had lipstick on it. Ewww."}
{"text":"Is this place super healthy? Not so sure! Maybe you could say it is somewhat healthy but probably not the greatest place for someone who's on a strict diet, but I have to say it tastes pretty good, so it all depends on the customer and what they want to receive. Anyway, I was a bit frustrated with the price, two bowls came out to be $30, and one of the bowls was just a side of mashed potatoes and brown rice!! It's definitely a nice casual dining place close to Boca Park and they are open 7 days a week which is convenient"}
{"text":"Quick and easy place to grab a healthy meal. Nice patio with umbrellas and misters. The Vegan Ingredient Salad (which could certainly use a zippier moniker) was simple and fresh, though a bit smaller than expected. Add a side and you should be right in the sweet spot: satisfied, but not too full."}
{"text":"Update: Still 4 stars, but the Pho (which WAS my favorite thing about this place) took a bad turn 6 or more months ago and now it's a 2 or a 3 star option. I'm not sure when it happened, but they updated their menu and one of the items that got an update was the Pho - based on their explanation: they made it so that you can pick your protein (the stock is still vegan and you can choose tofu or go without, or choose meat), they added a variety of mushrooms (???), and they made it more flavorful and heartier. Again, that's _their_ explanation. There are way fewer mushrooms. It used to be \"The Mushroom Pho\" with big chunks of flavorful mushrooms, now it's just pho with some bits of mushroom. And the broth is blah now (whether you use the sauce they give you on the side or not - sriracha and something that tastes like spicy/sweet/tangy bbq sauce). There are no more strong aromatic flavors of ginger and clove (and whatever else they used before). There are more noodles, but they are overcooked and almost mushy. And I am not just referring to a bad batch - I order this regularly because I am committed to vegan pho and I keep hoping they will recognize their error and switch it back.  

Vegan mix and match grain items and the vegan Thai Dye wrap are still good options, but they aren't very filling for my husband - he needs the Thai Dye wrap and at least two of the grain plates to be satiated. This is fine with him, but if you have a hungry healthy man, or the appetite of one, be prepared to buy two meals for him. It would help to fill him up if they had some vegan desserts, but they don't."}
{"text":"Pricy for what you get but everything tastes fresh and delicious. Portions aren't large but I was full off my meal which doesn't happen very often, lol!!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  Came 1st time and it was amazing! Big portion and so good. Brought my husband and the portions were smaller as wayyyy too salty. Decided to give it another try and ordered the same thing I had first time and it was a joke. 3 tiny pieces of broccoli not very seasoned and tiny pieces of steak and everything was soooo salty. Spent $20 on a lunch I didn't (couldn't) eat"}
{"text":"Love the Vietnamese salad with chicken added! So many flavors and textures going on in a yummy bowl of happiness. Always love the juice/tea options. A little pricey but you get what you pay for with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Flower Child is an oasis in a desert of boring American food in Phoenix. Flower Child is not a vegan restaurant - it has vegetarian and vegan options as well as many meat dishes.

It's fast casual restaurant where you order at the front and take a number placard for your table. More people order take out than sit down and eat. They have a big space with indoor and outdoor seating. There must have been at least 10 people working in the kitchen when I came in at 6pm. 

I came to Phoenix for a work trip and stayed at a resort for most of my time there. I had one more meal left before I would board a plane back to New York City, and I'm glad I came to Flower Child. I had the Thai wrap and it was delicious and spicy. The side green salad itself needs a round of applause. The salad leaves were surprisingly soft - like someone massaged the dressing in! The quality and presentation of the food was much finer than most fast casual restaurants. I enjoyed my food and hope to come back to try more!"}
{"text":"I might be a little bit obsessed with this restaurant after discovering it this past weekend. I've been there twice already! It's got a great atmosphere, the employees are upbeat and helpful, and the food is delicious and so fresh! On my first visit I had a grilled tofu plate with three sides, and my husband had the Vietnamese crunch bowl with salmon. We were both extremely happy with our meals. We also shared the avocado hummus - yuuuum! On my second visit I had the Mother Earth bowl with the tofu and it was just as good! Even though this is a bit of a drive for me, I'll be a frequent flyer here!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location and have had many great experiences. But tonight stands out as THE BEST!  A girl named Colleen took my order over the phone for pick up and was super pleasant to speak with even though I could tell she was very busy she never rushed me. Once I arrived at the location on a Friday evening I found out she was the only hostess working and it was only her second day! Her poise and positivity absolutely blew me away! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal there. I got the forbidden rice bowl and their homemade kombucha. Both are delicious. The rice bowl was sweet, spicy, and tangy. I loved the snap peas in it. I ordered it with some grilled tofu. It was delicious. It's a little pricey ($13 with tofu; more expensive for other meats). Why it's not 5 stars for me is the chaos. It's crazy in there at lunch! Fighting for seat, lines for the bathroom, noisy, and lines that could've stretched out door but instead went into the dining area because of the heat (it was a 118 day). Perhaps try it off hours? I plan on eating there again, and soon."}
{"text":"Finally tried this yesterday and it did not disappoint!!! I got the Vega Salad and added chicken. :) The dressing on the salad was so light and delicious.  My husband got the Flying Avocado Wrap. We also got the avocado toast (which comes with an soft boiled egg on top.) All was fabulous, fresh and clean. I loved the decor, fresh flowers everywhere and how friendly the staff was.  I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I like everything about this spot. Thanks, Yelpers for the recommendation! 

Sitting on the porch with a garden fresh salad and artisan iced tea enjoying the misters and good music."}
{"text":"This place surprised me in a good way! Very good food and fairly health-conscious options. Nice staff and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Are you ready to have high expectations....? Good, cause they will be met. We eat here 1-2 times a week. We have never had a bad meal or a bad experience. The food just seems to get better and better every time. The employees are always friendly and the managers are extremely kind and sweet. Well done guys!!!! Keep up the awesome work!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I was so impressed with my first experience at Flower Child. The staff was incredibly friendly and walked me through the whole ordering process. I ate the Forbidden Rice Bowl and it reminded me a lot of the Protein Bowl from The Chop Shop. (Which I also love.) I loved their large selection of teas and lemonades. I have to mention their restrooms because I personally am a firm believer in equality: They had a sign on the bathroom that basically said 'boy and/or girl' so anyone could use either restroom (keep in mind they are individual and private restrooms) It showed me the culture at Flower Child/ Fox Concepts were for equality and I LOVED that! 'Love is in the details!'"}
{"text":"I just went to Flower Child and found it FANTASTIC.  I am not a vegan and I do like meat.  I had the Beet, Avocado and Citrus side with the French Green Lentils with Fennel and Thyme and Snap Pea and Sobe Noodles with Grass-Fed Beef and it was fantastic.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and it was very busy.  I do not write a review and this is well worth it.

I can not wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I'm a born-and-raised Arcadian and true Fox Restaurant fan, so I'm definitely surprised I hadn't been here yet! I was definitely missing out this whole time!

I started off with the avocado hummus (SO good) and a mix of the pomegranate pear and acai hibiscus blossom teas (for a perfect amount of sweetness for me). For dinner I ordered the salmon and heirloom tomatoes (which came out with a balsamic glaze that actually went perfectly when it soaked into the salmon too... currently drooling). Upon eyeing my tablemate's sweet potatoes, quinoa, and veggies I decided I should have ordered more sides (AHH food jealousy!), but what I did have was amazing. I was very impressed.

The craziest part to me is how fast such high-quality food came out! We learned that the chef preps from very early in the morning so you aren't stuck waiting a long time for your food. I will definitely return, especially now knowing that I can even stop in when I'm in a hurry and not have to sacrifice taste or health. 

Special shoutout to our hosts Rob & Matt who (like all the employees) were extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and really made my experience memorable. :) Thanks FC!"}
{"text":"We all have those days were we feel sluggish and want to eat good food. Food that tastes good and is good for your body. Flower Child is the perfect solution. They've got a stacked menu and easily accommodate anyone that's hungry. They make everything from scratch and you can see workers chopping up fresh vegetables and making your meal.

Whether you're diary-free, gluten-free or vegan they've got you covered. The environment is calming and the flowers on the table are sure to brighten your day.  The only downside is that it can get pricier if you like protein in your meals. I always get the chicken, Mac and cheese and sweet corn and quinoa because it's so good that I don't want to stray away.

Overall, it's a great place to eat lunch or dinner and you'll be sure to feel energized for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Great gluten free options and everything we tried has been felicious. The atmosphere is also really nice."}
{"text":"Been here several times now and I feel they just can't get it together. 
I've actually only had one order out of about ten that has been correct. I don't know if the cashiers can't hear me or the place is just not polished enough yet in the kitchen. 
Food quality is there, just missing the mark a bit on presentation and organization. I would still go here though and if you haven't been it worth the trip.
Hope they get the little details ironed out soon."}
{"text":"Food was great. The service was ok, even though I don't usually like the 'order at the counter' type of dining. However, I did like the self serve juice bar. 
Great healthy options and the price point is palatable. Last time I was here they forgot a couple of things in my to go order so check carefully before leaving.
Chicken tortilla soup is a great choice."}
{"text":"This is a great little eatery-casual, good food, polite staff... I've enjoyed it the couple of times I've been... great shops nearby, as well!"}
{"text":"After 4 days on vacation in Scottsdale and eating at some great restaurants, it was time for something lighter. Wow, did this place deliver! Outstanding, satisfying and fresh. Simply delicious and maybe the best meal of the trip. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, sometimes it can be really hard to find restaurants that I absolutely fall in love with. Flower Child is hands down my favorite place EVER!!! The food is so fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend checking this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating flower child for over a year now. It's the place to call and order in food when I'm too busy to cook or at the office long hours. I am disappointed though because these past two times, their quinoa was not fully made so it did cause me some troubles that day later on. People don't want to hear this but something to keep in mind when picking what to eat."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh food with a fun chic ambiance. Just being there makes me feel happy, and the food does not disappoint! It is a casual lunch place. You order at the entrance and get a number. I have never gotten anything here I didn't like. It has vegan, vegetarian and meat dishes. Love Flower Child!"}
{"text":"This place was made for me! I am from Indy and I am so happy this was my first stop after I arrived in Phoenix. The juice was to die for. It was the one with carrots and ginger. I got the protein scramble. Everything was perfect. The decor was cute and the staff very friendly. I wish I could come here every day."}
{"text":"Fantastic food/service/atmosphere! Love the quality ingredients and location"}
{"text":"Okay, let me make this review as simple as possible: Flower Child is like the trendy (and expensive) love child of Panera. You walk up and order, then seat yourself and they bring food out. So many healthy options, many vegan or vegetarian, and the wine is organic. This location is sort of loud, but great for people watching. Be prepared for you meal to be in the $15ish range."}
{"text":"A delightful place for a wonderful lunch.  My neighbor took me here for a birthday lunch.  We shared two delicious wraps which were the Flying Avocado, and the Thai Dye which was Vegan.  Each came with a small side salad.  Everything was prepared well, and looked lovely.  The restaurant was full, and it is basically self service.  You order at the counter, and your order is brought to your table.  I will definitely return.  I only wish there was one closer to my home."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great fresh clean food and delicious assortment of drinks!! I highly recommend for lunch or casual hang low dinner! Ambiance, personnel, customer service and food are all outstanding!! Wish they would open another location further north!!"}
{"text":"The rebel wrap is AMAZING. The meat is tender and it comes with a delicious side of salad. Love the passion fruit iced tea. All the servers are very nice, and they can answer any questions you might have about the food.

Great value for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Quick note: always check your to-go salads for dressing because it's such a bummer when they forget to include it! 

My boyfriend and I grabbed take-out from here on our way to the park with friends. Our food was good (I saved the salad for later when I could enjoy with dressing...).I think most of the menu items could be made at home pretty easily so I don't see us going here too often but we will definitely be back if we are in need of another quick, healthy, take out dinner."}
{"text":"Another Fox winner!! Food is DELICIOUS(very fresh and top quality ingredients)..we had the mediterranean salad and the hippie chick wrap- both were fabulous...the flavored lemonades are wonderful. You will definitely LOVE this restaurant...can't wait to go back. Servers are friendly and VERY attentive.(and you actually see a manager on the floor who is watching everything and on top of things)."}
{"text":"I like the offerings, I just wish the veggie meal like Ancient Grains did not have so much oil. Tastes very greasy."}
{"text":"New menu with higher prices!
Gone is my favorite wrap sandwich which was light and flavorful, made with freshly cooked chicken. The wrap they suggested as similar, was NOT. It uses smoked turkey so the whole wrap tasted mostly of salty processed meat. Nothing fresh or light about it, no greens in the wrap, it lacked chunks of apples. 
I disliked the taste and I probably won't finish it. And I do not plan another visit. Plus I wasted 13 dollars on that pricey inferior wrap. 
The rest of the story: I went back and complained and they refunded my money,  It was an extra trip but now I feel better!"}
{"text":"Organic, grassfed beef, kombucha... you name it this place has it! Such a fun vibe inside, very casual yet very tasteful. The hubby wanted to get food to go so he could run home and catch the game on tv. We ordered kombucha, skinny Cobb salad with chicken, Mother Earth bowl with beef and forbidden rice bowl with beef. Then just for fun we got sides of Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. Wow! Everything was just so fresh and fantastic. I will post photos! And it came so fast. It is on the pricey side but well worth it. Thank you Flower Child and I love all the GF options because I'm gluten sensitive."}
{"text":"I was talked by my wife into trying this place. of which she has become a fan. Good, healthy food; good service; bustling restaurant - only one big deal-breaker problem: the prices / value for the money. TOO EXPENSIVE for the type of restaurant and type/amount of food! For the same amount we spent on two single entrees with no accompaniments, we could have gone to any of several buffet restaurants, or gone to any of a number of faster-food restaurants and fed not only ourselves but a couple of guests! Cut the prices in about half and I'd be willing to go back and even add a star or two. As it is - good as the food was, my first visit shall be my last."}
{"text":"I have been here several times because my boyfriend and I absolutely love the ginger miso dressing, but the last few times we've ordered from them, the food has been inconsistent. The chopped salad I ordered last night came with wilted lettuce and was missing avocado (the best part!), the Indian spiced cauliflower and sautéed spinach were cold as if it had been refrigerated and then thrown in the container, and the chicken and rice soup was just off. The service is generally weak as well; they regularly underestimate the time it will take them to get your order ready. Often times, you can see your order sitting there waiting patiently in the bag getting cold while the cashiers run around. The problem here is not a lack of people working - there are a ton of people behind that counter - but rather a lack of organization. If it weren't so ridiculously expensive for the small amount of food you get, I'd continue to eat there in spite of the inconsistency because it's healthy. We order two soups for one person because you get such a small amount, and we are fit people. If it were 100% amazing every single time, it would be worth the cost and we'd continue to go there despite the cost. But it's not. Consistency is important, especially when you're paying $4 for six bites of cauliflower"}
{"text":"We ordered the curry, salmon, Mac and cheese and tabouli and ate everything !!! Got a gluten free chocolate cake to go and it's moist and delicious! Love this place !!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant of the past few YEARS because it is ethical vegetarian food (with meat and seafood protein options) done right! I ordered a plate with three items: butternut squash with toasted huckleberries and maple glaze, steamed broccoli and brown rice. You might think that's boring but you'd be WRONG because it was the literal BEST butternut squash I've ever eaten! I bought the entire meal AGAIN to-go before leaving so I can eat it again tomorrow. I also tried the Wild Tonic kombucha on tap and it was divine. A jun kombucha, it uses honey instead of cane sugar and it was so delicious I would have gotten another one of those too but instead went to their website to see where else I can buy it at the store when I return home to SoCal. There were definitely some interesting folks and I will absolutely go to this restaurant again in another city if I travel to any of their other locations."}
{"text":"Yet again another delicious meal here at the delightful Flower Child on 44th and Camelback!  Tonight enjoyed the grass fed steak, spinach with crazy good garlic 'sauce' and their delish broccoli.  Desert because I had to..  chocolate gluten free cupcake things.. iced and I'm sure they don't qualify as 'health food'.  I had two :(
I'll go back soon and already have my next dinner planned (friend had this and I snitched bites). Steak, because it's so good and perfectly seasoned, sweet potatoes with sesame seeds and eggplant.. I think that had a Thai sauce... whatever it was, it was great and I don't even like eggplant :)
It was a great meal and I am looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the second time i visit flower child on 44st and camelback and i and my wife had dinner there friday sep 2 around 8 30 i had the forbidden rice bowl with chicken the rice bowl was cold was very salty i couldnt even eat that i never tasted food that salty before my wife had the rebel wich was burnt the mushrooms beef and onions were burnt as well as the pita was black i know it gets busy but i woildnt expect a fox restaurant to serve that kind of food this was my second visit and i will never good back there i wonder what kind of chef runs this kitchen"}
{"text":"Stopped into the restaurant for dinner with my family Friday night. I really like this newer style of walkup ordering and then the staff brings it to the table - I've noticed it more and more. This place does not disappoint. Inside is clean and fresh and bright. The staff was helpful and pleasant. And most importantly, the menu was first-rate.

Grain and veggie bowls included roasted vegetables. The protein options are all responsibly farmed and sustainable. Good sides too. They also serve draft kumbucha and beer. 

Everyone had a good meal. Well done!"}
{"text":"Ever since the Elite Event at Orange Theory, I've been looking for any excuse to come back and nosh at Flower Child. 

A long three months later, the opportunity presented itself on my way back from some meetings.

Yeah, it's that delicious. Locally sourced food made with love. 

You order at the counter, and are given a number. 

Take a seat anywhere, the staff will find you and your number even if you go on the patio! 

Since I had been CRAVING the Mediterranean Salad with a healthy portion of Salmon, I didn't try something new.   

It's the perfect blend of greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, garbanzo beans and lightly dressed with feta and an oregano vinaigrette. 

This is what I love about Flower Child: Simple ingredients are the star on their own, without being drowned out in cheeses or sauces. 

Also, the seasonal Apple Cider Lemonade was phenomenal. Was not expecting that combination to work! 

Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"With the high prices, I hate to admit how much I loooooove Flower Child. 

Yelp / Former Community Manager Extraordinaire Lindsey D.  introduced me to this place in 2014 after \"Yelp Kicks Butt at Orange Theory\" and I have dreamed of their Mediterranean Diet Salad with the perfect cut of Salmon, Mac & Cheese, and Flying Avocado Wrap ever since.

There's something about clean, beautiful ingredients that allow the flavors of a dish to shine on their own without destroying them via a massive dumping of sauces or cheese. Keep it simple, please!

I was in the area last week and in between meetings with clients, and really needed to eat lunch. 

Walked up to the counter, ordered the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl ($9) with Chicken ($5) and a Amber Spiced Tea ($3). After tip and tax, this all came out to $21.  

The bowl did not disappoint and I'm glad I veered off course from my standbys. 

This had plenty of red quinoa and a medley of lightly sauteed vegetables with plenty of crunch (celery, onion, zucchini, snap pea, jalapeño,), Thai basil garnish, and of course, a healthy sprinkle of cashews. 

The shiitake mushrooms were a welcome surprise. And I was happy with the amount of spice this delivered. Not blazing hot, but not Taco Bell Mild Weaksauce either. 

The chicken was cooked perfectly; however, I could have done with a little extra protein for the price point. 

The Amber Spiced Iced Tea was very pleasant tasting with various spice notes. I did notice it was pre-sweetened and didn't see any signs indicating this. 

Again, great food and concept - I will come back when in the area, but not too often due to the price."}
{"text":"Flower Child is really good! I just think it is a tad pricey for the portions they give you. What I really like about this fast, cute, lunch spot is that you know you're going to receive quality food that's very tasty. I like the concept of choosing a couple sides and pairing it with one of their protein options. I'll usually go for a veggie option + brown rice or quinoa + grilled chicken. Very yummy and fresh - but again, pricey for this small portion of food. Their lemonades and teas are really great as well, so give them a try!"}
{"text":"Really great place to go and get a healthy meal! Visiting from San Diego saw this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try. Really happy we did, the meal was great and they also have a kids menu with healthy options. Definately recommend this place.
Well done Flower Child!"}
{"text":"I love this place because of The diverse, yet healthy, menu. I have had a wrap here before which was great. My only recommendation would be to increase the portion sizes, the salads can be quite small and I did not leave feeling completely satisfied.  Nonetheless, I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant. The food and juice I had were great. I loved that they had a few local beer options as well. It seemed a little pricey, but really not too bad for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Glazed sweet potatoes
with daikon and sesame
Cold udon noodles

Roasted asparagus
Strawberry Yuzu \"cheesecake\"
Thanks Fox gift cards"}
{"text":"The Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl with Salmon ($9 plus $7 for the Salmon) was delicious.  Unlike a lot of these healthy vegan, gluten free, vegetarian restaurants that serve overpriced dishes with little satisfaction on taste; Flower Child was a delightful surprise.  The kombucha on tap was excellent (gogi berry) and served chilled in a mason jar for $5. I would skip on the organic wine as its mediocre yet definitely be back for the food."}
{"text":"The salads are a little over priced. This place is one of the lower quality fox restaurants.  The avocado hummus is 7.00 for a small serving.  It's good but small.  The best meal is just get a mix of sides. Sweet potatoes great, the cauliflower is also great"}
{"text":"One of the few places I've seen that offers gluten-free mac and cheese.  Yesss.  Their flavored lemonades and teas are also amazing.

The only downside was seeing fruit flies.  The kitchen is open and there were veggies out being prepared, but with fresh produce comes fruit flies.  Hopefully that was a one-time-thing."}
{"text":"Straight to the point. If you don't like the food here, we can't be friends. The menu is diverse and the food is so flavorful."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to find out that they opened a Flower Child closer to me in Scottsdale! it was actually the highlight of my day! I went for lunch during the week and there was about 20 people ahead of me in line. I was a little nervous about the timing since I only had an hour, but I was done eating in less time than that. (We waited less than ten minutes before our food arrived.) They have fruit infused water for the people waiting, which is a super nice touch for the summer heat. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl with all natural chicken, their chili infused sweet potatoes are to die for!!!! A friend got The Rebel Wrap which has grass-fed steak. Both were amazing and light and didn't make me feel guilty for eating it. They have many teas and house made lemonades to choose from. The cucumber mint lemonade is awesome. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Healthy food, friendly staff, Lemonade to die for.
First time here. Tried the \"Rebel\" wrap- so delish! It seems pricey but when is healthy food cheap?"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick lunch. I got the forbidden rice bowl with added chicken and the decaf açaí Iced tea. It was the perfect combo to sit outside and have a nice quiet lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  Great atmosphere. Great choices for dairy free and gluten free meals.  Wonderful salads, soups, and steak!"}
{"text":"Went there today hoping they were open to public but alas not till the 29th. Gave my wife and I a complimentary ice tea though. Tea was quality! Can't wait for the food. Place looked great!"}
{"text":"We came the day after opening day and loved this place. As per usual, Fox always has awesome decor.

We enjoyed the counter experience, but come early because it gets busy very quickly for dinner. We ordered a beer and wine on tap and we each got the protein with a couple of sides. I had the steak, GF mac and cheese and roasted veggies. Fiance had chicken, kale and apple slaw and the asparagus. Everything was cooked perfectly in my mind and the roasted veggies were my favorite. Fiance said the mac and cheese wasn't his favorite because the texture is a little grainy from either the pasta itself or because they used a white rice flour (or something similar) but I actually enjoyed it a lot because of that. 

We have officially decided that we cannot move out of this neighborhood. There are just so many great places to go and this was a wonderful addition."}
{"text":"We went to Flower Child for lunch after hiking up to Cholla Trail. The eatery was clean and attractive. We drank their flavored water while we looked at the menu. 
They have rather a lot to choose from, so if you're indecisive, prepare to scroll through a lot of delicious-sounding options. Don't worry! They all looked pretty healthy! 
I ordered the Thai Cashew Salmon Quinoa bowl, and it was super delish! The spiciest, delicious quinoa dish I've had the pleasure of knowing, and I'm not a fan of quinoa! 
The only reason why I ordered it is because it was pure protein, and it sounded better paired with baked Salmon. 
Every mouthful was succulent, and barely a mouthful remained in my bowl, and I'm sure I'll be back. 
The whole experience was very low-key, chilled out. The staff was very friendly, and a perfect place for an after hiking, delicious bite out."}
{"text":"I ordered a kale salad with salmon they messed up the order but gave us both orders free. They were fast and efficient with my to go order. You don't have to wait for people who are dining in. My salad was delicious. I definitely recommend this please."}
{"text":"We were invited to check out this new gem prior to the opening. The environment was something that Summerlin has been lacking. We're vegan and we finally have somewhere to go with friends that might not be vegan. There are options for everyone including a very cool kids menu. Hats off to the friendly staff. The food, service and environment was an A+! We looking to frequent the Flower Child!"}
{"text":"I love to grab lunch here once a month.  I would go more...but it is a wee pricey.  BUT....worth 
every penny.

Wait staff are always on top of it.  Love the drinks too.  Tastey teas!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about Flower Child a few weeks ago and I am having a hard time staying away!  The food is amazing, the service is excellent and it is very well priced.  Both of my daughters love it as well!  I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"So excited my favorite Scottsdale restaurant has opened up a location in Summerlin, Las Vegas! So good! Healthy and nutritious!
Mother Bowl is awesome as always! See you again next week!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed. This place is super cute and colorful! It's a lot bigger than I had expected. From the outside, I did not expect such a large dining area. They also have an outdoor shaded sitting area if you're wanting a little more fresh air which is just as nicely decorated as the inside. 

The service is impeccable and I received my food in a timely manner. I had the Mother Earth bowl which had ancient grains, sweet potato, portobello mushroom, avocado, cucumber, broccoli pesto, charred onions, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, and hemp seed. It was the perfect blend of flavor and was very fulfilling. They give you the option to add protein but it was just fine as is. I also ordered their seasonal lemonade. They hand you a cup and you have the option to choose from the 3 different flavors they have displayed. I went for the cucumber mint lemonade which was so refreshing and you can really taste the cucumber. Refills are allowed so I definitely went back for more before I stepped back out into the Vegas heat that day. I look forward to trying more of their other food options. 

I was quite impressed by how fulfilling their food was. Considering most vegetarian/vegan or any kind of healthy food spot leaves me hungry after 5 minutes, I actually didn't have to eat dinner after this place. If you do go, I recommend getting the Mother Earth bowl. It didn't seem like much but it was actually the perfect serving. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really a phenomenal restaurant! Flower Child focuses on bringing the healthy foods to you in an extremely delicious and manageable fashion.

The atmosphere and service are great. It's fun, loud and full of energy.

I had the flying avocado wrap. It was very fresh; the wrap was a little toasted to give it some crunch and the sauce matched it all perfectly.

Definitely a great hipstery and fun joint!

~Carpe Diem~"}
{"text":"So good. And completely unexpected! Staying in Phoenix for the evening.  Super sweet and welcoming staff. Stopped in to pick up lunch. Menu was incredible, great selection of healthy and even healthier options. The chicken wrap and beef wrap were so yummy. Seasonal fresh ingredients. Got a few tasty desserts, the lemon olive muffin, vegan raspberry truffles, gf chocolate chip cookies were all amazing. Atmosphere was awesome, would have stayed to eat if we didn't have our pup. Fresh cucumber water outside, indoor and outdoor seating. Fresh iced teas and wellness drinks. Open kitchen feels fun and friendly. Must stop by here!"}
{"text":"I dream about this place on a weekly basis and wish that we lived closer to this establishment, so that I could eat my favorite, forbidden rice bowl, much more often than I am able. Not only is the food delicious, but I love the variety of lemonades that they offer. I love that every time I go there, I know I will get to experience a new flavor. I can't leave without the their gluten free lemon muffin to satisfy my sweet tooth. The mere thought of it has me salivating right now. The only downfall of all this yumminess is the price. They are definitely more on the pricey side, but well worth it for delicious and healthy food."}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food!! And their Lemon Olive Oil cupcakes are the best.....super good!!"}
{"text":"Good health organic food with vegetarian options I def recommend this place. I usually get the avocado wrap with baked tofu and it comes with a side salad. Their ice teas are really good here so is the mac and cheese. Only thing I'm not a fan of are their overpriced menu and small portions. Their sides are so tiny."}
{"text":"Flower Child is a bit on the pricier side, but I appreciate the farm-fresh ingredients and the fact that there are so many healthy options. I went for the Memorial Day special, which was BBQ chicken, kale coleslaw, sweet corn quinoa, and a drink. The strawberry lemonade was so flavorful and refreshing. But mostly I just really like dining here because of the fresh flowers and bright, colorful decor. It's a really nice place to grab a bite to eat with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! When I first ate there, I loved it so much that I ate there for 4 days in a row afterwards haha. The service is usually pretty fast and the food is so good. I love all the healthy options that they have. It's a tad bit pricey, but healthy food is usually more expensive so that makes sense. The atmosphere is also awesome. The restaurant is so cute. Perfect for insta pics!!"}
{"text":"Yummy healthy fast food for lunch or a simple dinner with friends.  They have order-sit-down service, but they also have servers to clear tables and serve additional food/drinks once you are already seated.  Their small selection of house wine is delicious too."}
{"text":"Great options and food but I need a side of pepto Bismo when I eat it. Not worth the dirreaha."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, and I've liked everything I tried.

Both times I got the two sides and a protein meal. I can't remember one of the sides from the first visit, but the other was the quinoa w/corn, which I LOVED. One of my friends who I came here w/the last time ordered this and I *pretended* like I never had it before just so I could have a bite ;) The protein I had was the chicken, which was kind of plain (I guess that's the point here though), but it was tender and well-seasoned. 

The second time I came I got the brussel sprouts, sweet potato, and tofu. The tofu is grilled, which is how I like it. the two sides were flavorful. The sweet pots were particularly good. They were cooked all the way through, but weren't mushy. My group also ordered the avocado hummus, which was DELICIOUS. It was creamy & the pita was really good. 

Both times I came here I remember not thinking they give you a lot of food for what you pay for. However, I was full but not disgustingly bloated each time so I do think they give you more food than what it looks like on your plate. 

The first time I came here this place was out the door packed (you order at the counter and the food is brought to your table), but the last time it wasn't too bad. The food comes fairly quickly & the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to (and reviewed) the Flower Child in the Arcadia area, and honestly, this one is pretty much the exact same (which is a good thing).

I really like Flower Child, because even though it's healthy, it's not like some places with similar concepts where it feels like you're eating/drinking grass & cardboard. I like the option where you can get a protein (or tofu) and pair it with few sides. This is what I did when I came here.

I got the tofu (which I've gotten in the past and knew I liked). I also got steamed broccoli. It was pretty plain, but it's what I expected and it was cooked well. I also got the sweet potato, which was delicious (it a has a little bit of kick to it)!

It was kind of an unexpected lunch stop when I came in, but it was PACKED on a weekday, which I'm guessing is normally the case here given the area. We didn't have to wait too long (I was with one other person who also ordered tofu and two sides), but for a place that you order from the counter (normally I think of places like this to have quick service) we did wait a little bit. I'm not sure I'd come here if I were in a hurry even though it's a quick concept kind of place."}
{"text":"Our first time dining in. Been here tons of times doing take out for my boss. LOVE the gluten free Mac and cheese. Also found a new favorite, Wild Mushroom Pho. If you haven't, you must try this place!"}
{"text":"I started following @eatflowerchild on IG when I saw their sign go up months back! I was so excited that we were offered the chance to join them in Soft Opening / Training Day for Flower Child! I was already anticipating amazing food just by their IG! But when we checked in and saw the menu I couldn't just order one thing! 

It was my co-workers and I, who were able to check out the new spot. We ordered the Avocado Hummus, Crushed Avocado Toast and Vietnamese Crunch Salad to share at the table. We loved the toast and hummus! Those were two items that we would come back for time and time again! The toast had the perfect amount of avocado and the sliced egg was in every bite! Yummy!!! The hummus came with thin pita slices, but that avocado hummus was well made and it was so smooth and delicious!! 

As far as our meals, we had 2 3-side plates and a Rebel wrap. The portion size is excellent! It's enough to get you full and satisfied but not overly stuffed! I had the green beans, sweet potatoes, and eggplant with steak. The best side I had was the eggplant! I loved the sauce it was served with plus the cashews were an amazing addition to it!! The steak was well prepared and it was the perfect amount for all the sides!

The staff was friendly and super helpful with the ordering process and they always made sure our plates were cleared and we had everything we needed as we enjoyed our meal. 

I'm intrigued to try the rest of the menu and their different flavored lemonades! Though it's a little far for me, I'd definitely come back! It's a beautiful location and the layout is super cute!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious, healthy food in a great earthly enviroment, then you need to try this restaurant. I tried the red quinoa rice bowl with cashews, snap peas, jalapenos, celery, onion including chicken...simply amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loooove this place, and I wish there was something like it in San Antonio!

When we arrived, we were able to get right up to the counter to order (no wait service here, although they deliver it to your table once your food is ready). Shortly after receiving our food though, the line was out the door, so get here early or not at peak times.

The food was delivered quickly and looked beautiful. My sis and I split a couple of the dishes, including the Thai Dye wrap and a winter salad with added tofu. Both had great flavor, and I definitely recommend adding the tofu to the salad for some added protein. The tofu had a great smoky flavor, so it wasn't just your run-of-the-mill tofu. I love all of the great vegetarian options!!!!

Price was a bit high for lunch, and we left without leftovers, but for the quality and flavor of food I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"I wish every restaurant was just like this place! What a dream come true! Natural light, live plants, fantastic selection of healthy, delicious food, and friendly staff. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The manager stopped by our table to check on us and my friend told him she's vegan and how great it was to find a place that serves delicious vegan dishes. A couple minutes later he came by and offered us a complimentary vegan chocolate pudding! The customer service, atmosphere, and food are all excellent at Flower Child!"}
{"text":"I went to Phoenix for a four-day conference and fortunately discovered this restaurant toward the start of it.  I liked it so much that I pretty much only ate here for the rest of the conference, with other people and on my own. 

I actively seek out restaurants with high-quality ingredients (local/organic/etc.), and I really liked everything that I ate here.  

The atmosphere is a little noisy during prime eating hours, but I didn't think it was nearly as bad as some reviewers suggest.  I thought that the process of ordering from the counter was fine and that the restaurant was clean and quite attractive. 

The pricing seems expensive when compared to restaurants serving industrial quality food, but reasonable compared to other restaurants with good food quality.

Highly recommended for those who care about the quality of what's on their plates."}
{"text":"Drove past this place many times when I was visiting a relative at the hospital across the street, and decided to give it a try! I'll have to give a 10/10 for the taste and quality of their food, I love their concept and how delicious and healthy the food is! Will definitely keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"I feel thoroughly annoyed by the amount of food that I got for $21. The salmon that you see here was $7 add-on."}
{"text":"stopped in for a quick bite about a week ago, very healthy, loved the Mediterranean Salad, then ordered for delivery over the weekend.  Salads are so fresh and with a variety of different ingredients in each, making you want to try the next one on the menu.  Think i will be just going down the list."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  I have been to both locations and my favorite is this one (44th St).  Everything I have tried here has been delicious and everyone I've brought here has agreed wholeheartedly!  I love all the vegetarian options and ingredients.  It can get busy with a line out of the door at times, but it usually moves pretty quickly and I've never waited very long for food.  I have had to sit outside in the heat because those were the only tables available.  I also love that they have takeout with a separate pickup/register."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please This place is not for me (or my my daughter).
She had gotten some  , so we ordered online.
My daughter got  wrap called veg out. We are both lifelong vegetarians  but she said it tasted like fish! She threw it away.

I got 3 sides, tomatoes w watermelon (?weird combo...) and green beans w sugarsnap peas. This was SWIMMING IN OIL, which was gross. Also got SIMPLE hunmmus which was very intensely smothered in oil and garlicky? I got immediate indigestion and nauseated from the excess oil. I also ordered pita bread and when I got back (this was all takeaway) it was not in the bag.
We both felt sick after eating our takeout. I am a bit of a purist and it seems to me too many odd combinations on the menu, so I would say this is the emperors new clothes kind of place. Plain did not like it at best and left us both feeling sick to our stomachs. Will not be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I love that they are very vegetarian friendly, but also have add ins so my meat eating friends can get their fix too. Love the Mother Earth bowl, and their house made kombucha & lemonades.  Always a treat!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Beautifully designed decor with deliciously healthy food.  I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Kombucha on tap? It's the new thing....?  Ok, i'll bite.

Flower child satisfies my inner granola girl.  Their slogan goes something like: healthy food for a happy world serving local produce.   

Not super hungry, I chose to order some sides and share.  Here's what I got AND recommend: 
####Heirloom tomato and watermelon with thai basil, sea salt, and olive oil.  Delicious.  Loved that this was dairy free and delicious. 

####Roasted Asparagus with toasted umami. I would eat asparagus everyday if it was like this. 

#####Beets, avocado, and citrus-

Additionally, I sampled one of the best vegan cheesecakes EVER and a chocolate chip cookie.  Delish.  If you are looking to sample Kombucha for the first time, I suggest trying it here. Their GT's trilogy kombucha was gooood.  

Flower Child, please come to Norcal. We need a dope, healthy place like this in the BAY."}
{"text":"Love the pick 1,2 or 3 option! My favorites are the spicy glazed sweet potatoes and the soba noodles!! They always have a great selection of fresh lemonade!"}
{"text":"This food concept is one of my absolute favorites! You cant go wrong with the food- favorites are Vietnamese Crunch salad with salmon and the Mother Earth bowl...never knew vegetarian options could be so delicious (ME bowl). Lines can be long at lunch, but they do a great job of getting you ordered and seated quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing for omnis, vegans, and vegetarians! I'm vegan but my husband isn't, we both left with a full belly and smiles on our faces! The woman at the front who took our order was so sweet and helpful with suggesting things and modifying anything that we wanted modified. Definitely get the vegan chocolate pudding and thank me later!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, I have loved everything that I tired, I love the Flying avocado the most! The people here are so cute and peppy and friendly, it has a great ambience! It is well decorated and the kitchen is an openly viewed kitchen, which I like because you can see how clean it is in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"The place was good and busy. As a  vegetarian . I did not find mush of choices. So I seetled for a quick bite on their mashed potatoes and fried garlic. To my surprise I got a small bowl of mashed potatoes with fried garlic mashed into it. It was delicious, but I wish they offered little more for that order."}
{"text":"Yummy food! I love roasted or grilled veggies and this place has some of the tastiest I've eaten. The hummus is great as well. My favorite is the roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. The food is mostly healthy with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Meat is an option for those who are not vegan/vegetarian but really the veggies here are amazing. 

The portions are not the typical fat American size but they are plenty filling. I have heard complaints about paying too much for a little scoop of food. I'm a pig and like to eat. I'm used to large portions so I can see why some people may be a little put off. I will admit when my food came out (I had the roasted sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, hummus and eggplant) I was thinking it didn't look like much but It was more than enough. 

I like the decor too. It has a lot of earthy tones :)

I do like the whole hippie vibe but this doesn't take it too far. It's a very clean, upscale, hippie/flower child decor. Some of the menu items are a little on the higher price ( a few of the all natural drinks) but for the most part this place is affordable with great food. I certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yes, Yes, Yes.  They get it!  Great real food.  Excellent for Gluten Free.  Grass fed meats.  Some unique and interesting recipes.  We will be back.  We loved it."}
{"text":"The Soup of the Day on the billboard was from yesterday's menu. They forgot to take it down. Sad. Strike 1.

The free-range egg + quinoa bowl I ordered, and requested no corn. Hey Flower Child, all corn is GMO. Why is it on your menu? I asked for no corn. I was told that since I didn't want corn, I also could not have the beans. So, I received a measly portion of quinoa with a splattering of egg, and about 1/16th slice of avocado. Sad. Strike 2.

My daughter ordered a-la-carte brown rice + tofu. I think the price was $9 for her Pick 2. The amount of brown rice was less than 1/4 cup. The slices of tofu were minuscule and barely there. She tried to doctor it up by adding some of my quinoa. Still Hungry. Strike 3.

Kombucha: when I ordered it, on tap, I was not given a choice or description of Kombucha. I saw they had 3 or 4 taps. I was just given Kombucha. I have no idea even what flavor it was. What was that? Strike 4.

Price: wasted my money. Strike 5."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for lunch.  Great tasting healthy food in a beautifully designed restaurant!  Love the options to mix and match the foods or just pick a set item.  Cold brew coffee on tap and fantastic house-made lemonade as well.  Menu items can be a little pricey but I suppose you are paying for quality healthy food."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!!! The food is healthy and has great flavors! If you're looking for something different, don't hesitate to try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!! I met some friends here for a casual Tuesday night dinner. As I scanned the menu - it was difficult to determine what one item I should order as there were just too many seemingly good (and healthy) options!! After we all discussed and decided (we promised to each order separate items and share to ensure the broadest taste experience)- I landed on the Late Riser (much like a Mexican breakfast bowl). Very flavorful and filling - I would order it again. My friend had the GF Mac and Cheese (side - which was very small and not extremely impressive) and the Mother Earth Bowl (yum yum yum - so good). I also had a glass of organic white wine (ok fine I had 2 glasses) and left with a brownie (per the suggestion of the cashier). Fully satisfied with everything we consumed! The place was really busy (not overwhelming, however) so I'm glad to see its doing well! I hear there is one coming to Santa Monica (close to me - as I live in LA) and I can't wait to try that location later this Summer!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm this chain is the perfect combination of flavorful healthy and convenient. It doesn't take too long and the food is always good. It's pricey for \"fast food\" but worth the quality of food. Just a disclaimer - the servings aren't huge. It's fine for me but not for my husband who I've been there with. Some cute touches are water station for your dog and a yoga mat drop off area. Very cute place for pictures!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to meet friends for lunch.  Delicious combinations of healthy, organic foods.  I usually split a wrap and a salad with a friend.  Make sure to try the chocolate chip cookies!  You will wait for a table but it is a reasonable wait.  The atmosphere is great and very friendly staff.  Excellent choice if you are a healthy foodie!"}
{"text":"Yes the glazed sweet potatoes the mac and cheese the mushroom bowl thing all amazing. However, this review is mostly about the steak wrap which was fireworks on my tongue. Gosh, it was really something to dream or daydream about. That steak wrap is worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious had a tofu quinoa bowl and it was so good! The a avocAdo hummus was amazing. Service was wonderful and everyone  is so nice. Their drinks are delicious  too!"}
{"text":"Meh....I wasn't thoroughly impressed with this place.  It was hard to make decisions on what to get, and when I decided on one of their bowls, I definitely wasn't blown away.  The chicken was dry and the noodles weren't that great.  The broccoli, though, was amazing.  So if you want broccoli, then go here.

I was told the next time to try the Hummus...though $12 for Hummus won't make me go running back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Excellent food and friendly service. Late Riser bowl and the Skinny Cobb w grilled chicken are my favorite dishes. For desert, get the lemon gluten free muffin - incredible!!!! Must check this out;)"}
{"text":"So after months of wanting to try this place I finally decided to go with my mom and we both loved it. Their white peach lemonade and flying avocado wrap were delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. Be have had take out once ordered the Rebel. Was absolutely fresh and delicious. Very nice change from the ordinary stuff around.  By the end my hunger was more then satisfied and I didn't feel like a greasy blob afterward. 

Came back a few weeks later and dined in.  Service was excellent. Line was a tad long but moved quickly. The hostess/cashier was very friendly and eager to answer all question.  Ended up going with the Flying Avocado this time and wow once again was delicious.  Probably my new go to wrap.  

Now all I can hope is they open on in south Chandler/Gilbert area closer to me."}
{"text":"Food was great! I had the Mother Earth with chicken and a very nice girl who helped me decide what to have. My food was brought out to me in less than 10 minutes. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this new location opened closer to my home. The food is so fresh and delicious. I have loved everything I've tried. Their salads are a good size and you can add protein (steak, chicken, salmon, or tofu) for a few extra bucks. Their soups change daily and the 3 different ones I've had were unique and yummy. My husband always orders the forbidden rice bowl with steak and its great. The lemonade/tea and fresh baked goods are also noteworthy. They have a couple of local wines and beers on tap too. 

Service is A+, decor is adorable, and seating is plentiful. The ONLY downfall is that for 2 of us we never get out of there spending less than $45-50."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Flowerchild for months. I finally was able to experience Flowerchild today and it exceeded my expectations!
The staff was friendly and the food was overall great. The menu looked so good it was difficult to decide on what to get. I finally went with the Flying Avocado wrap  which I loved. It was flavorful and tasted light. The portion is pretty big so you might have some left overs. I also got the Indian Spiced Cauliflower on the side.  I thought it was ok. It tasted to cauliflowerey (I know I'm making up words).  Usually when I eat cauliflower it's fried and and unhealthy.
I can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food. Everyone was so incredibly friendly and willing to help, answer any questions and offer smiling faces. I had one of the wraps and it was filing but not overwhelming heavy. I can't wait to go back and try more things"}
{"text":"I came here at 1 on a Wednesday. This place was packed! The food was amazing. The service was extremely friendly. I had the Mother Earth bowl with salmon and ate every last bit. Wow. Everything on the menu looked good to try in the future, but I'm going to have a hard time not ordering the same again. The sweet potatoes in the bowl were heavenly. I come to Phoenix every 2 weeks and I think this will be one of my regular spots. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the manager/owner is very nice. Great ambiance and the bathrooms are accessible, gender neutral, and clean.  I love all the fresh flowers, both outside and on the tables. 
My new fav restaurant!"}
{"text":"What an awesome addition to the neighborhood!  We came pre-opening night. From the moment we walked up, staff were friendly and welcoming. You order at the counter and choose a table-many seating options both inside and outside. The decor is reminiscent of a farmhouse-albeit modernized.
Food came fairly quickly. My daughter had the forbidden rice with chicken. She describes the chicken as being cooked to perfection. Her veggies were very fresh and the flavor was impeccable. The Mac and cheese was quite tasty - made with a sharp mixture-a good tone of Parmesan. The vegan poke bowl was filled with fresh, well marinated veggies. Kombucha on tap - delish. We finished off with a gluten-free brownie which was good yet crumbly. It needs more moisture and less time in the oven. Very chocolatey. We will certainly be back!! Can't wait to try more dishes off the menu."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite for a quick and healthful meal! I've tried many of the menu items (the Mother Earth bowl is awesome) but my favorite meal is the mix and match sides. The chili sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts (rotating seasonally with the amazing green beans) and turmeric roasted cauliflower are my personal favorite! You can't go wrong. And you absolutely have to try the lemonade! Ok now I have a serious craving! Thanks Flower Child!"}
{"text":"Tasty vegan options! Adorable ambiance. I've been here twice in one week! It's that refreshing. You order and pay first. So don't let the line scare you away. There was a sweet girl offering lemon water to people in line- nice touch. Oh and I noticed someone eating dessert near me (I wanted it) and the crew (same girl serving up water in front) on the floor took my order and served it in minutes and I didn't  have to get back in line again! Service, service, service!"}
{"text":"Great healthy alternative with lots of flavor.  Food is a little pricey but I trust their ingredients.  Certain plates should come with a side of rice, such as the coconut curry veggies dish. Overall, I like this place."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot!! The food is nutritious, it tastes amazing and the price point is very reasonable. Friendly staff and a very clean, positive environment. The manager, Kent Walker, was also very pleasant and came to say hello while we waited for our food (which didn't take long). Thank you! We absolutely will be back. So happy to finally have a healthy, fun place in this area!"}
{"text":"We have been legit STALKING this space ever since the banners went up that a Flower Child was taking over the old crappy Applebee's location. I spent months salivating over the fact that Flower Child would be within WALKING DISTANCE FROM HOME. All that build-up would have to lead to some sort of disappointment, right?

WRONG.

It's perfect--if you can go at a time where there isn't a balls-long line out the door.

Our first visit was a Friday for early dinner. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. (I'd been sick all week so I just wanted to eat early and sleep early--lay off my grandparent dinner-time, OK?!) Even at the early hour, there were several tables filled in the dining room, and the patio was about half-full as well. A good, good sign.

The inside is so cute. You're sitting in someone's open, breezy, sunny, clean room and waiting for food perfection. The decor is clean and cute.

I decided on the Thai Dye wrap: tofu, Thai basil (my FAVORITE), avo, carrot, radish, cilantro, snap peas. Their homemade wheat/flax/chia wraps are the absolute best. Fiance went with the Flying Avocado wrap: chicken, smoked Gouda, romaine, tomato, avocado hummus(!). We were both enamored with our fresh our wraps were and how tasty everything was. We also decided to split the Thai cashew quinoa bowl. This was absolutely outstanding. Perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned red quinoa tossed with a variety of \"Asian-y\" vegetables (Shiitakes and snap peas stood out), mixed with cashews for the perfect crunch. Add a protein onto this and you're golden for a meal.

Oh, and the flavored iced teas/lemonade/not a soda to be found? Refreshment-face.

Sounds good, right? Well, good enough to RETURN FOR TAKE-OUT LUNCH THE NEXT DAY! Hey, when we find something we love, we love it. At 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon there was a line to the door, so we called in our order while we ran some errands to take up the 35 minute wait time. We returned 25 minutes later to find our food packaged up and ready to go.

2nd round: Chopped vegetable salad with added tofu for me. Probably my new favorite salad. Everything is so dang FRESH, and the miso vinaigrette packed such a lovely punch. Hippie Chick wrap for him. Apparently FC's version of the chicken salad is the best he's ever had. We tried a side of sesame soba noodles for kicks. So tasty, and perfectly portioned!

Do you think we're obsessed enough? Well, we're planning on picking up dinner after I get out of a late meeting tomorrow. So yes, we are three-trips-in-one-week happy that Flower Child has arrived!"}
{"text":"Went to Flower Child for the 3rd time for lunch around 11:45am.  Long line waiting all the way outside the restaurant in today's 106 degree heat.   Line moved very slowly and there was not enough shade to cover every one.  My girl friend went inside to tell the manager to serve cold water for guests waiting in line as we spotted a young pregnant woman standing in the sun.  Finally, a young girl carried a tray of water and lemonnade passing it around.  There was no table inside the eatery availalbe, so we cannot order food at the counter and were told to sit aside until there is table for us.  Another 10 minutes wait until the hostess gave us a table number.  At this point, we had already been waiting for 40 minutes!!!  I had the Flying Avocado which was tasty.  My girl friends had Madras Curry and Chopped Salad with chicken.  They liked their meals, but we all felt the portion was small.  Curry has only few slices of chicken, no rice.  We were satisfied, but not full.  

The menu was simple, but it is obviously for people that are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free,  The portion is definitely small because my teenage son went there and had to order two dishes and a desert.  It gets very expensive!   As for me,  I am too poor to have any digestive issues, so this place, although health conscious, is not where I'd come back again any time soon.

I went there all three times waiitng in the hot sun and no one from the inside the restaurent is paying any attention to serve cold water.  There is obviously not enough tables, staff or the ordering system is not working smoothly.  As far as the food taste, it is similar to True Food, other than few popular items, the rest is very blend.  Definitely NOT worth waiting in the heat and long line for 40 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, dog friendly patio (complete with misters for hot days), and tons of veg friendly options! 

The only downside is the lengthy waits."}
{"text":"A friend of mines took me here for take out lunch last week. Never knew what Flower Child was but, heard of it! 

The ambiance is very comfortable, clean, and modern look with the kitchen to be open. As you walk in there is a jar of cold water with a citrus fruit inside for you to have as you wait in line for your food/picking up your order. 

It is a self seating of first come first serve although we did not sit in to eat, I noticed how fast the tables where getting turned over for quick clean and open tables where readily available for the next customers to sit. 

Customer service was quick, fast, and polite on ordering your food/picking up.  

I had their curry salad with salmon. There dressing for their kale salad was delicious with the right cooking of the salmon. I love my fish, especially being spoiled of eating fresh fish from the ocean and knowing how it should be prepared. There are some places where I just cant eat it here in Arizona, it's either too too dry, undercooked, or not fresh.  But, here at Flower Child's it was on fleek to perfection that I wanna try and make this at home when I have some time but, of course I'd have to go back to try my best and master the flavors first.  LoL

Nice place for a lunch visit...."}
{"text":"I love that this restaurant has tons of food allergy options, and is a convenient place to grab a healthy and delicious lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is Great! The perfect pick me up after yoga or a hike on Camelback! Always fresh clean eating and a chill laid back vibe to compliment your dining experience...Dine Inside or Outside and expect nothing less than outstanding customer service!

I love their Cayenne Lemonade...crisp and fresh with a touch of hot that leaves your tastebuds craving for more...and luckily you can...fountain drinks at their finest!

You'll love the variety and combination of food options...every time I try something different and have yet to complain..Healthy and Inspiring food!"}
{"text":"I had a kale salad with salmon added. I loved it! This is the way a salad should be prepared- super fresh ingredients, cut up small and with a perfect vinaigrette. The salmon was cooked exactly to my request (medium rare). The line was very long, but a server came by with samples of their teas and lemonades. I felt well taken care of. I am happy that they will be opening up more locations."}
{"text":"I'm a surprised fan of Flower Child.  My girlfriend found it while we were looking for a spot to grab a quick breakfast on our way to the airport.  She originally found some basic breakfast sandwich places, but then cam across Flower Child, and she obviously loved it for the vegan and vegetarian options (I say that as if you all know who my girlfriend is and that she's vegetarian), and as they had some carnivore options, too, it seemed like a perfect place.  

They took our order over the phone, but we arrived before it was ready.  First thing I noticed was the cute outdoor patio.  There wasn't much to look at, seeing as how it's in a strip mall, but nevertheless, it was a nice place to sit outside.  The inside is also very bright and airy - a very comfortable place to eat.  Their menu is pretty healthy looking with, again, lots of vegan and vegetarian options but something for everyone.  It's a counter order and they bring you your food, kind of place.  

We both got the quinoa breakfast burrito - scrambled eggs, heirloom bean, corn, roasted chile, avocado, smoked gouda.  I subbed out the avocado for spinach and added smoked turkey.  It comes with a side of salsa.  Quinoa struck me as a strange ingredient in a breakfast burrito, but it really worked.  This was a delicious burrito.  Not only did it taste great, but it was stuffed and filled.  Probably could have used a bit more protein and a bit less quinoa, but it wasn't overwhelming.

Great find by my love, and a great place for you lucky Phoenixans.  Phoenixers.  People in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is good if you are trying to eat healthy or on a diet. I guess I usually go out knowing I will be eating something I can't make at home. My tofu and my friends chicken were both bland- no sauce or flavor. Expensive and left hungry. I would try it again because there was a lot more in the menu but I could get much tastier food from AJS right next store or true foods down the street for the same price."}
{"text":"This is the new neighbor to one of my favorite places, so I was excited to give it a go. As you enter, you're met by a combination of frenetic energy and pleasing decor. The menu has a lot going on and offers lots of options for vegetarians (while still providing some meat choices). The staff is super friendly and helpful. And the food is ready fairly promptly without sacrificing quality or freshness.

However, I would recommend they clarify ingredients. They offer two soups: one clearly states mushrooms (among other things) while the other, an Indian curry with lentils, lists what I thought were all the ingredients (sans mushrooms, which is what I was looking for). Unfortunately, the soup arrived at the table,  fragrant and full of mushrooms. I counted two lentils. So I think Flower Child should list their ingredients clearly, particularly for those who might have allergies, in this case to said mushrooms, and also offer two distinct soups, with less shared ingredients. Also, they should probably dip the ladle deeper into the pot since this lentil soup was lacking lentils. 

All that aside, everyone was very nice about replacing it. We traded it for the avocado toast, and that was delicious. The black sesame is a nice touch. We also shared The Rebel wrap which has grass-fed steak, onion, cheese, arugula, and a nice flavor. (I would recommend that the cheese is evenly dispersed on the wrap - my half had no cheese, the other had all the cheese.) 

Flavors were good and the place interesting enough to warrant another visit. We left with a gf lemon olive oil cupcake, and that was tasty. Thanks to everyone for making the soup situation right."}
{"text":"This place was great I love the atmosphere the open seating outside. Everyone was so friendly. Food was great. I got a cob salad and it was fantastic. I love their crushed ice"}
{"text":"Pretty sure our stomachs were the happiest campers for feeding them such delicious healthy choices during this meal!

Decided to see what the hype was all about with this place and I'm totally with the hype on this one! I'm big on the atmosphere of places and this place just gave me all the healthy, new, fun, friendly, market place vibes! Lol this place was super modern rustic totally Pinterest worthy. With as busy as it was there was no shortage of indoor and outdoor seating!

Now the food...SO FRESH. Everything tasted like it had been pulled right out of a backyard garden, seasoned and cooked to perfection, and served beautifully on your plate! I'm sure when some people think \"healthy restaurant\" they associate little taste/joy out of eating well, but this place has both the \"good for you\" and \"tastes good\" on lock. The fact that Flower Child is vegan friendly too is a HUGE plus for us!

*Love this place to pieces, just a tiny bit pricey - I assume it's due to all the freshness - but it won't keep me from coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to get a healthy, reasonably priced meal. Had the Cobb salad with salmon and it was delicious and refreshing. Their lemonade and tea was great as well. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I use this place a lot for my business as we cater lunches for doctor's offices and it seems Scottsdale doctors are all about it. Way overpriced first off. 7$ for a salad seems reasonable until you realize that's without meat. tack another 5-6$ on top for the meat. And for a place that touts healthy food, the sides are all chock full of sodium. I have never had saltier asparagus, and that was not a one time only experience. I have suffered through the salty asparagus at least 6 times now. Long lines and waits, staff is not necessarily the brightest or friendliest, and we have had multiple catering orders not prepared correctly. Also once the staff gave us grief about ordering the food on the phone 3 hours in advance for 10 people saying it was not enough time. 3 hours is not enough time? Wow. This place is the flavor of the month for Scottsdale. People go for the name, but the food is not worth it. A shame as Sam Fox restaurants are typically spot on. If I can avoid coming here I will."}
{"text":"A good choice for straight forward healthy dishes. Clean, good variety, indoor/outdoor seating and friendly staff. Order at the counter kind of place."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for healthy restaurant options, and Flower Child is a great one and is fortunately close to my home and office.  My one complaint is that I find it a bit overpriced.  Portions are good, but, compared with places like Chop Shop, I just don't understand why it's so expensive.  Having said that, the food is delicious.  My favorite is the Early Riser bowl, which I get with steak.  It's such a unique combination of ingredients, all of which are fresh and flavorful!  I could eat it every day!  I also love the Madras Curry and the Avocado Hummus.  Finally, service had always been on point.  I typically offer take out, and it's fast and friendly.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am overly stoked about this restaurant opening up a few miles away from my home.  I have been waiting for it's grand opening since I first heard of the announcement coming to North Scottsdale.  As I expected there was a line out the door.  Not unusual for this place.  It's location in Arcadia is always busy.  

Once I arrived I was greeted with a menu and asked if I was dining in or taking out.  I chose dining in and to be seated in their outside patio.  She provided a number that I would give to the person taking my order.  The line went by fairly quick.  I was in a line of at least 15 people and within 10 minutes I was placing my order.  I ordered the Rebel Wrap $13 and a regular drink.  It can get pricey to eat healthy, but this wrap is probably one of the best wraps I've had.  I filled my drink with their signature cucumber lemonade and I sat at my table.  Within 10 minutes of waiting my food arrived.  Impressive timing considering the amount of people.  I was in and out of there with time to relax in about 45 minutes.  

I imagine it'll be busy for a while, but it's well worth the wait if you're looking to indulge on a healthy meal.  Their gluten free desserts are also a great treat for the sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I got their chopped vegetable salad with chicken and it was not only delicious but beautiful.  The produce was fresh and colorful. The miso vinaigrette was a nice contrast in flavor. Highly recommend, but I can't say the same for the gluten free mac n cheese.  It tasted like noodles in milk with a little cheese on top.  It just lacked flavor. I would like to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing food, great service, and very easy place to be. The music is just about right to have an intimate conversation and not worry about it being bothersome to those around me. Great place to be."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Such a great find. It's like eating home made fresh healthy food. We traveled to Arizona and stayed in Scottsdale within walking distance. Service was great. I ordered a plate with spinach, sweet potatoes, and chicken. My son got steak, smashed potatoes, and Mac and cheese. My husband got bird is the word. 

I really enjoyed my dish. It was fresh, flavorful, and you can tell they use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I Stopped in on the way to going to AJ's and was glad I did!  I like to eat healthy and it's not always easy to do for a guy on the road during the day.  But this is the answer!  I had the curry chicken bowl and it was quality!  It was a hearty portion and filled me up.  Super good flavors and something I couldn't whip up at home.  I say to check it out!  If I had a date I would take there!"}
{"text":"Dined at Flower Child (corner of 44th and Camelback streets) with a couple o' others on a weekday and it was quite busy. The openness of the restaurant with its loudness reminded me of a cafeteria, but a hip cafeteria indeed. 

I concur with other reviewers about the pricey plates, the atmosphere, the operations, etc. but I did enjoy my time, so a solid three out of five stars for FC and I may return in the future.

There seemed to be a large number of employees (and now that I think of it, FRC's do employ a decent number of workers in proportion to square footage). Two cashiers took orders and a line several folks deep waited behind us. Although a lot of tables were taken, we easily found one with good spacing. No cramping, no leg touching under the table, no one bumping into my chair while passing behind, no \"excuse me's\" with polite but annoyed smiles.

So that was definitely a plus. Another plus are the healthful options on the kids menu.

Utensils wrapped in napkins were the table centerpiece, still you can help yourself to more which are located against the wall alongside the teas and colorfully-mixed ades. 

Food was brought to us in three rounds. The plates are small, but I gotta give Flower Child credit for making the dishes look so ungreasy and clean. A+ for presentation. The chicken wrap and salmon hot pot that the others ordered looked good and came with a portion of veggies or salad.

I was the last to get served even though I thought my order was the simplest. 

- avocado hummus with pita:
pita was too thin and hard
hummus mixed with corn, radish, pumpkin seeds
salty taste, could not tell it was hummus 
I don't favor chunky hummus

- bowl of Pho:
who orders pho at a non-asian restaurant? 
I stupidly raise my hand, guilty as charged
tasty, but I didn't finish it
too many noodles
not enough mushrooms
came with sides of basil 
jalapenos, bean sprouts, lime
and two sauces barely palatable
the red sauce tasted like a spiced up catchup 
the darker sweet sauce...plum maybe?
I honestly have no idea what it was 

- side of roasted asparagus:
literally three spears of the plant cut in half 
salty seasoning with an umami sauce
\"roasted\" turned out to be \"blackened\" and overcooked

- lemon cake:
resembled an upside down cupcake
yummy, good lemon flavor
no overly glossed sweetness

Desserts are not listed on the menu but they are displayed next to the cashier. 
After dinner I reviewed my receipt and found out that the lemon cake was gluten free.

Holy anti-wheat Batman, they tricked me!"}
{"text":"Extremely clean restaurant inside and out, and the food is the highlight of the show here.  Fresh, healthy, makes-you-feel-good menu items.  I sampled a bit of what everyone ordered in my party of six...everything was scrumptious.  The drink options were all bursting with flavor, and I like that you could refill with any flavor you'd like at your own leisure.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am very excited to welcome Flower Child to central Phoenix. I love that the menu has something for everyone especially vegetarian and vegans.

I ordered the minestrone with kale & quinoa. Excellent!! I also ordered the masala curry bowl with tofu. Excellent!! I don't usually like raisins mixed in with my food but the sweetness complimented the dish very well. 

My husband ordered the chicken coconut soup. I don't eat meat so I didn't taste it, but he liked it. He ordered a Thai, quinoa bowl with steak. Fortunately the steak didn't touch everything so I was able to taste it. Yum!!! I'll get that dish next time.

2 soups, 2 entrees with protein added and 1 lemonade=$46. 

The staff was attentive and friendly. The customer base was a nice mix. This place reminded me of True Food minus all the \"pretty people.\" There are a lot of items I want to try so I will be back."}
{"text":"Horrendously rude counter service followed up by overly salty not so fresh food.. left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I love this place. Another home run for the guy who has brought us other healthy dining places. I haven't seen a poster of Twiggy since I was a kid. I had the Hippie Chick wrap. This old hippie chick loved it. We brought a party of 7: everybody got something different and everybody loved their entrees. The staff of young ladies was very friendly and helpful in accommodating our largish party. Those of us with serious arthritis were allowed to sit at our table while the others ordered for us. I wish I could get Diet Coke with my meal instead of some kind of complicated tea or lemonade concoction. Gluten freeness, the current mass delusion, is catered to here. Diabetes, on the other hand, is real. Hello? But I guess you have to go with the zeitgeist to make money. Minor gripes aside, I will return to this place in my neighborhood frequently. Others obviously love it because the line is out the door, but the wait was not that bad. I'm going to try to figure out when their off-peak hours are before I come back. If there are any off-peak times."}
{"text":"Solid healthy upscale casual lunch spot. Super trendy in terms of people you'll see plenty of lululemon yoga pants here. You order at the counter and take a number and wait for your food.  

Favorite items are kale salad or mediteranean salad with an added protein salmon or tofu. Also have many lemonades which are good but a little sweet for my tastes. Steak wrap is also top notch with a side of gluten free mac and cheese. I like they have real silverware ground pepper shakers and of course siracha.

People who work there are friendly and good at helping if you need something. This place reminds me of fast casual places all over Los Angeles like Lemonade or Veggie Grill or Urban Plates in San Diego.

Negatives would be slightly pricey esp if you get a lemonade or cookie with your entree it will be over 20 bucks per person. Also food times is semi-inconsistent sometimes it comes out fast sometimes takes forever. I've seen this when the place is full or empty, but the food is fresh.

All in a solid 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the menu you can eat a heavy healthy meal or a light healthy meal. The salads are so filling and you can choose to add protein or not. The best items are the sides to me. I usually make a meal of them. I love the gluten free mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, spinach and mashed potatoes. If I feel it I sometimes do two sides and add salmon or I just do three sides. Everything is fresh...usually...I go often and there has been a few times I got my food and it was luke warmmm...they fixed it but its happened a few times..for \"fresh\" food..."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I am vegan and gluten free and their menu is awesome. Everything is always so fresh and delicious. The kombucha on tap is always soooooo good too. I normally get the pick 3 plate(choice of side) or one of the bowls-something like sautéed spinach, red chili potatoes and Indian spiced cauliflower with a side of hummus. I'm sad they don't have the plant based cheesecake anymore-that was incredible!"}
{"text":"Decent food and good, friendly service. Very cute ambience.

PARKING: very accessible and very easy to park 

SERVICE: the employees were all very friendly and sweet :)

AMBIENCE: very, very cute place! Tons of seating and cute artwork. Easy place to come with friends or bring your family 

FOOD: the food is definitely PRICY but pretty good. I got the freebird wrap which had turkey, apples, dates, and pistachios. It was served with a small side salad. Good but probably not worth the near $15 I paid for it. All of the food on the menu looked healthy and delicious but it was just too expensive :/"}
{"text":"My go to every time I'm in Phoenix. I absolutely HAVE to come here for some sweet chili sweet potatoes, fresh-pressed juice of the day, and one of my fave bowls or salads. Makes me feel good inside and out. It is impossible to even step inside this place, look around and no be happy. I just wish they had one in Tucson...please come to Tucson!"}
{"text":"Put simply, my favorite restaurant in Phoenix ... and that says a lot since I have lived in the city my whole life and pride myself on trying different restaurants. Flower Child manages to accomplish the holy trinity: healthy, affordable and delicious. The only part of my visit that I don't enjoy is having to decide what I want to order since everything is so good. I've had a few items that have stood out from the rest: Vegan Poke Bowl, Mother Earth Bowl, the Rebel and Glazed Sweet Potato. This is a must try restaurant if you're in the Phoenix area and want a healthy yet flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on Sunday, not much of a wait. It is a bit pricey but worth it in my opinion, I did the pick a plate and chose their red chili sweet potato, gf Mac and cheese and salmon. All delicious. Look forward to going back and trying something new!"}
{"text":"I got the Mother Earth Bowl and added chicken. It was very good food but too expensive in my opinion. Now this place does focus on healthy eating and everything was made with fresh ingredients and bowl did taste good. If someone is looking for a place like this I would recommend this place as I did like the food and it was a cool place with friendly people but I had a the earth bowl and added a piece of chicken and a drink and paid over $20. Now I didn't brake the bank but I wouldn't normally spend this on a lunch spot unless I was getting a larger meal."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to check this place out since I'm not vegan, but a very healthy eater so I figured what the heck, I gotta go and and see. I am so glad I did. They have the best lemonades and teas hands down! I have become pretty partial to getting the same thing every time I go. It's portioned the way we should eat meals, smaller, so if you  are looking for your food to be doubled and served to you size wise, you won't like this place. It's always busy when I drive by."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. 

The food itself is delicious. The negative part is the portions are extremely TINY! I also didn't care for the price for such small portions. For the price I paid, I felt like I should have gotten a. decent meal, when in reality it felt like I got 2 half-portioned sized appetizers.

Greens and Proteins is much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love Love Love. Everything is fresh and delicious. We never feel gross or bloated leaving this place. Yummy!"}
{"text":"After trying Flower Child a few more times, it's really REALLY good. It is difficult finding better vegetables in this town, and the selection of bowls, wraps, or even salads are all above average and won't leave you feeling regret. 

I also don't think anyone can top their lemonades, with varieties like Rose Petal or Carrot-Ginger. 

I never regret coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Sam Fox's restaurant so i decded to give this place a try. Super cute decor, super fast service, but a bit overpriced. 

I ordered the grass fed steak protein plate with the Red Chili Glazed Sweet Potato. The potato's were AMAZING. So delish! My steak was cold.. however since the potatos were that good i didnt care about my steak being a bit cold. Definitely planning on going back to have some more potatoes!"}
{"text":"It was very good. We sat outside as inside is kind of loud. As for the food it was very tasty!!! However, $21 for one lunch entree and a drink is a little pricey if you ask me. That is no tip either. I am guessing it is the location too, in the heart of Phoenix. The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is for the price. The food and drink were delicious, but not a place to go to all the time."}
{"text":"This establishment is decorated so well 'in theme' \"Southern style\"  that once inside, you can easily forget you are in Phoenix. The menu options are broad and extensive. I had the salmon with roasted Brussels Sprouts and avocado as my two sides. ALL items were extremely well prepared and very tasty indeed. A truly exquisite culinary experience. They also have a great selection of soft drink flavors - I had the strawberry and ginger - most refreshing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Flower Child puts an exclamation mark on healthy eating.  It's so hard to find healthy options when eating out, but here you can actually spend time looking at the menu struggling to decide between the mass amount of options. Really good stuff. Hope they open more across the valley. The west valley really needs something like this."}
{"text":"Service is excellent.
Everything on the menu is delicious. My favorite is the Mother Earth bowl with tofu, but you can't go wrong any way you go. 
Ambiance is inviting and comfortable if you dine in and to go is easy. 
The only downside is the price for the portion size."}
{"text":"Today I experienced an above beyond belief in service today!! Sean is hands down the best manager I have ever met!"}
{"text":"Great food! Delicious, healthy, wonderful! So glad I gave this place a shot."}
{"text":"I have never had such good flavors in one bowl in my life. I got just the burrito bowl with grass fed steak and about cried. It has corn avocado beans . Everything meshes perfectly. Their soup of the day is to die for and not to mention the best lemonade ever. Flower child and the Henry are my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"We went to the Flower Child today for lunch and it was excellent!!! Atmosphere was awesome and the food was so reasonable. Get the olive oil lemon muffin. To die for!!! 

The quinoa corn, mac and cheese and salad was so good. Just an all around great experience. Wish we had this restaurant in SC."}
{"text":"service was great! People here are very nice. My steak wasn't up to par. It tasted like cardboard"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The freshness of food is a 10! Not to mention the variety of options to appease any one person's taste buds. Can you please bring one to Fort Worth, TX? More specifically, Keller, TX!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food! Everything tastes SO fresh, and crisp. The atmosphere is bright, colorful and charming. This is such a great spot to take friends and the food is always on point! The salads are tasty but so are the warm savory rice bowls. Good vegetarian and vegan options too!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Healthy food and a good environment. Can't wait until it opens up in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Crazy good food!  Healthy and satisfying.  Great ideas and thought in the menu.  Enough choices to keep you coming back.  I had Mother Earth.  It was delicious.  This guy knows food and how to keep it interesting."}
{"text":"So I finally tried this today 
Not sure what happened to my order but it took almost 30 minutes . 
Not really sure how long food takes here so  I didn't say a word . 
When my food did come they apologize that it took so long  .
The lady who dropped off my food came back with a full refund and apologized again .
Now we did not complain or even ask for any of our money back 
She said the Manager told me to bring this to you .
THAT IS WHAT I CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
The food was awesome too ..
We will be back !!!
Thank you"}
{"text":"The anticipation was worth the wait. After being on a cleanse for days I wanted something healthy and hearty. The location is perfect for me and rich next to plenty of my favorite restaurants. Walked in kinda lost of how to order or what do do but you figure it out pretty quick. Love the decoration of the rustic style and open room look. Walk in and order up front and you get handed a number to take with you at the table of your choice. Fresh juice changes everyday. I ordered the juice of the day and it was pretty refreshing. I also ordered the beef wrap and my friend got the chicken wrap. The orders were to go and received it in about 10mins. Do expect to pay for the cost of fresh and healthy ingredients. For two wraps and two freash juices, the Avocado humus it was $40"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. My son likes this place and recommended it. Since we were close by we decided to try it. 

When we got there, there was a huge line almost out the door. Figuring this place out, you order and pay then they find you a table. Ordering process seemed like Hop Doddy. So I was cool with this. My son said that when they aren't busy then you find our own table. So little different. 

The only thing that made me a little uncomfortable was when someone was going down the line talking to each party and how many they had. When she got to us, we told her we had 3. Then right away she told us to jump the line and go to the front. Now, I really don't like doing this but the woman lead us to the front. Still didn't like this but I complied. Only problem is that I really didn't get a chance to look over the menu which is above the ordering counter. So I had to hurry up and decide. 

I ordered the Forbidden Rice which had snap peas, bok choy, broccoli, carrots, onions, and I added chicken. It was pretty good. Pretty healthy dish and a pretty big portion which filled me up. Everything was fresh. I thought it was good. Not great but good. Chicken was cold and really didn't have a lot of taste. Like I said the dish was good. 

My son and wife both ordered the Mother Earth. They both liked it and my son always orders this. It had sweet potato, mushrooms, avocado, and cucumber plus other stuff. No complaints here. 

Overall, the food was good, fresh, and healthy. Service was good especially since they made us jump to the front of the line. You get your own drinks and they bring your food. So it we had a pretty good time. Good food and great company. So we will probably be back. Enjoy and eat healthy."}
{"text":"Healthy delicious meals for the entire family. My son ordered the blue corn tortilla soup today and I had the Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl. Both were amazing and seasoned perfectly. Their iced teas are Yummy and refreshing as well expect to pay $3.50 for your cup. 

Normally, I get a plate of salmon with sides like Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes but I changed things up today. My sons love their GF Mac n cheese which is also delicious. 

Never disappointed! Only 4 stars since they are on the pricier end."}
{"text":"Blake just FYI, after speaking with one of the mgrs(feel so bad as I forgot his name..ughh) and he even sat down on the to go bench (as I call it) to chat with me and I told him about my review and what would make me give a 5. Well just FYI ever since I spoke to him I have to say there was a shift in dynamics and I can happily say you have earned my 5! Thank you for caring!

Stopped in twice this week with my mgr and my team and they thoroughly enjoyed. You guys rock!! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This restaurant has phenomenal service and treated me so politely and were courteous. The food is to die for. Love this place. :)"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends the other week for some dinner. It was pretty good overall. When I first arrived I noticed parking was a nightmare. You might want to get there early if you are meeting people or look for parking not directly in front of the restaurant because the spots are pretty small and hard to come by.

 When you first walk in it is kind of confusing; you order at the register and then they bring your food to you. To me it looked like you would wait by the sandwich bar for your wrap/salad since they have the glass there, but I guess it is to add to the ambiance or whatever. The look of the restaurant was nice. It looked like something out of an Anthropologie advertisement. Kind of vintage with earthy colors, but still modern looking? if that makes sense. 

I ordered an avocado chicken wrap and got an iced tea. I chose the Acai iced tea which was AMAZING. It was probably one of the best I've had. When I got my food I was also impressed. It came with a side salad that was pretty good and the wrap was also yummy. 

I just found it hard to justify paying $16 for this meal. I felt like it was a good quality meal with great ingredients and could probably justify paying at THE MOST $12 for it. But to be honest at Whole Foods I could get a wrap and iced tea for around $10. It just kind of irked me. I also thought it was really loud in the restaurant. I couldn't talk at all to the people at the other side of the table which stunk because we came as a group. Maybe the outdoor seating is better, but it was kind of warm out. The food was good, but I probably won't come back. I can get organic wraps and salads at many other places for much cheaper."}
{"text":"So much goodness.  Lemonades made fresh daily, great vegan, and fresh dishes.  Love the earthy vibe."}
{"text":"I love the quality of food and the atmosphere! Inside feels like you're in Martha Stewart's South Carolina home. I particularly love their salads and fresh teas. Yum!"}
{"text":"I like the concept here for the most part. When I went to the new location I did enjoy all the things I tried, the avocado hummus, a salad and a wrap. 
I do think it's overpriced and the plates can be small. I was definitely surprised how small the hummus portion was. 
When it comes to the best bang for your buck I don't think this is a place I would put anywhere near the top of my list."}
{"text":"Why did you change the cup sizes so disappointing. I like large cup please bring them back."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy. Stand in line, order your food and you will get a number. They bring the food to your table. There is so much on the menu! I was almost glad to wait in a long line to figure out what I should order! Everything I had was awesome! The Rose lemonade is so good! I can't wait to go back to try more"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful and I was not disappointed by the portion size as others have commented on. 

Highly recommend taking some time and visiting Flower Child. Fox has hit the nail on the head again with this one! 

Notes: 
- You stand in line to order and then chose a seat to have your food brought to you. 
- Servers are standing around the line looking to help and answer questions on the menu while you wait. 
- Very open atmosphere and pleasant experience while waiting. 

Food: 
+ Avocado Kale Salad was much larger than I anticipated. The dressing was sweet but balanced wonderfully with the bitterness of the kale. You could possibly use less dressing, although I didn't find that to bother me too much. 
+ Mix & Match: 
 + Roasted veggies were very well done and melted in your mouth. More carrots than anything. 
 - Dark greens were less flavorful and somewhat bitter. 
 - Beet/Citrus/Avocado is a must if you like beets. The combination pairs incredibly well together!"}
{"text":"My mother and I went to Flower Child this evening. I had the Mother Earth bowl with tofu being a plant-based meals inclined person. It was amazing and nourishing as well as filling. My mother has the Thai Cashew Quinoa with salmon. It was so hearty she couldn't finish it but loved it. The ice teas were also delicious. In a perfect world it would be a bit quieter inside but the atmosphere is welcoming, contemporary and inviting. If only I could eat all my meals here. I will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in town. If you're looking for a healthy, vegan friendly, inexpensive yet so delicious meal... this is the place !!! My favorite so far is the \"Forbidden Rice\" and the \"sweet potato\" by far the best sweet potatoes I've ever had!! 

Food? -----AMAZING !!!! 
Service ? -----10 out of 10. 
Atmosphere? -------Beautiful. Very hippy, natural and comfortable. 

Absolutely zero complaints. Must visit flower child if you're a foodie. 

PS- they have   meat options for those who are not vegetarians. 

Who can compete with that? It's a place for all!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a favorite for me! I've been here twice now. The vibe is a mellow modern kind of hipster feel to it. My boyfriend and I tried the strawberry salad, they kindly split it into two bowls for us. The fennel mixed with strawberry and coconut was such a good mixture. We also got two sides which were $7 total. Japanese eggplant which came with cashews and some kind of sauce then sweet and sour squash! This was just such a good combination all together. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for clean eating and a plant based diet."}
{"text":"Flavorful for sure! Prices are a little high but matches the food. It was our first time there and they ran out of eggplant, so the manager came and let us know, we shared some laughs and she gave us her card with free side of eggplant for our next visit. 

Definitely fits the hippy era theme, great food, always packed seating was hard to find. Other than that I would recommend for a lunch meeting or a day worth he girls."}
{"text":"Kale Salad and The Rebel are my favorites!  The avocado hummus is really tasty.  I love the whole
Coconuts to drink.  My friend had the beef  rice bowl with shaved beef which also looked really good.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for lunch. Everything is super fresh. Clean, healthy food. Favorites are the kale salad, avocado wrap and the quinoa corn. I am a food photographer, and once I photographed their avocado toast for a local magazine. I don't usually eat food after photographing it, but I ate every bite of that avocado toast! The staff is friendly and professional, and the dishes are consistent and utterly delicious. 
A word of caution about parking...avoid parking up against the property under the misters. The misters spray water that contains minerals/salt/oil. After lunch one day, I came out to discover my car completely covered with dried water spots from the misters. I immediately had it washed at the car wash. It did not come off! I spent $100 to get it buffed out. The restaurant management was gracious and prompt. They paid me in full for the $100 that I spent. I will be back...many times over. But I will park away from the misters!"}
{"text":"Fox restaurants always do a great job creating a chic environment! This place makes you want to invite a group of girls to get together and enjoy lunch! Finding a healthy quick spot is not always easy but this place nails it! The flying avocado wrap is great and the bowls are wonderful too! I wish they provided us with more protein but you can always ask for extra. My only negative comment about this place is the price... 40 for two at lunch is a bit much."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options, even a daily vegan soup! This place is the best, modern, most forward thinking restaurant in Scottsdale! I'm in love! The service is always wonderful, and v quick! This is a must try! I recommend the Thai dye wrap! The hummus is incredible, too!  My favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank Larissa for her help when it came to ordering gluten free and vegetarian friendly food.  I was so amazed at Larissa's knowledge about all the dishes.  I'm so thankful this restaurant was able to accommodate to those with Celiac's. Larissa was so friendly and polite. In fact, the staff there is amazing. Larissa came by to make sure our meal was perfect and also gave us the delicious gluten free brownie and cookie to try. Loved the food. And loved the service. Thank you for making our day! Highly recommend the GF Vegan Thai wrap!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, healthy food and some good draft beer choices. The ONLY drawback is it's a little more pricey than some other healthy options for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Literally went here the very next day after trying it for the first time because I wanted more. 

This place serves healthy, casual fast food. You basically choose a protein & can then choose a salad, bowl, or combination of sides to go with it. I've tried the Thai Cashew Quinoa (so much flavor!), the salmon, the Indian Spiced Cauliflower, the Sauteed Spinach, the Simple Sauteed Broccoli and the gluten-free mac n cheese. They were all good & I can't wait to go back again. Their menu is easy to explore since it's actually all stuff that you will like eating...

Finally, you have to try their lemonades!!! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Was introduced to his place about a month ago and came back again the other day.   One of the better Sam Fox restaurants in my opinion.  Love the flying avocado wrap sandwich.   Looking forward to mixing and matching some of their proteins with bowls and wraps in the future!"}
{"text":"Found a large spotted moth in my salad. Usually the food is great. The manager did refund us and gave us a $25 gift card to come back. All of us could not eat the rest of lunch."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite Fox restaurant or even top 5. The food is fresh and they do have quasi-healthy options but there are also many not so awesome things about Flower Child. 

Likes: 
*Fresh & Fast
*Spiced Cauliflower is excellent!
*Beautiful Patio with full shade from the Western sun

Disappointments: 
*Loud! Music was blaring. 
*Price - you walk up and order the food, the portions are European sized... so why is a salad so expensive? I could have ordered basically the same salad at Sauce (another Fox restaurant), had double the portion and paid several dollars less. 
*Chopped Salad was not chopped. Pet peeve of mine. If you call it a \"chopped salad\" then actually chop the ingredients. 
*This place is trying to portray itself as fresh and sustainable, but napkins, cups, and other items are single use, future landfill dwellers."}
{"text":"Cute environment and great tasting food. I tried the spicy sweet potatoes and avocado beets.  My gf had the quinoa salad and they all tasted pretty good. Awesome vegan options but sides can be a little oily! If you're a high carb, low fat vegan it may be one of those exception days. 

Only down side to this place was when I told  the cashier I wanted a cup for water, she asked me what size cup so since I'm a big water drinker I asked for the largest size.  After I started eating I realized that I was charge for a large drink because my bill was more than it would've been for what I ordered.  More than likely she charged me for a large drink when I just wanted a large cup for water.  Didn't realize they had small cups next to the water dispenser.  

Either way, I would return to try some more stuff on the menu.  A great place to try after a hike from Camelback mt too!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I recommended to all my friends! The flying avocado wrap was on point"}
{"text":"Great flavor profiles and an ambience that can't be beat. You can see the kitchen in entirety and it is very clean. All the ingredients are truly fresh. The decor makes me think of a European bistro without any pretense. I had the curried chicken with vegetables and it was delicious. I only wish the portion was larger. It's on the pricey side, so I won't be eating here often, but it's a great lunch spot if you're looking for something healthy and quick. Try the mango green tea, it tastes like cotton candy! And the watermelon lemonade is so refreshing, I could drink that by the gallon!"}
{"text":"My tummy is so happy!!! Flower Child is the perfect lunch spot in Uptown Phoenix. When I came in it was packed and I thought my food was going to take forever but it didn't! The Mother Earth bowl is crazy delicious and filling. The Mac n Cheese is utterly to die for I wish I could bathe in it!!! It's very very very noisy from the kitchen and the crowd but there is a beautiful outside patio to make up for it!"}
{"text":"Great location and amazing food. Flower Child has quickly become one of my favorite lunch time spots. First time at the camelback location, but I also enjoy the uptown location. Get The Rebel. It's AMAZING. Also, the Skinny Chop Salad is easily now my favorite salad and I want to make it every day lol."}
{"text":"I frequent this location, the food is always prepared great and fast. I love the quinoa/corn and sweet potatoes. If you ever need assistance like you dislike what you get, they will go above and beyond to make you happy. All levels of employees (management) are excellent here."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since some members of my family were on a diet - this place is great if you are on one. Healthy and delicious, but you can still stay on track with your macros. I'm going to say it straight, the flavor is BIG, but the portions are SMALL. 

The restaurant itself has such beautiful décor. Hip and modern. It's great that you walk up and order your food, given a number, and you pick a table. So much better than waiting around waiting for servers. Water is self serve as well as utensils. Yes, food comes out quick! 

Drinks - mostly teas and lemonades. Most sound amazing! I have to say the teas are on the bitter side because no sugar is added. Totally natural. The Lemonade is more on the sour side.

Food - like I said previously, the food is BOMB. So much flavor, you wonder how they do it and still keep it healthy. I got the Strawberry Fields salad with added chicken - which comes out to about $13-14.  The salads are a generally bigger portion since you're getting so much greens - so definitely more filling than the plates. The rest of my family members opted for the protein and sides  (these can go up to $15+). If you order the steak you only get 4 pieces (4oz approx) and for the chicken approx 6 pieces. We had a plethora of sides. Broccoli parmesan which you don't really taste parmesan, red glazed sweet potatoes - on the sweeter side, cauliflower - crispy and delicious. Can't really go wrong with the sides. 

I'd come here if I'm willing to go for something more on the vegetables and good carbs and take a hit with protein. The price kind of will keep me away since it won't fill me up."}
{"text":"I can't believe that it has taken me this long to visit Flower Child!! The decor and space is very well put together. They think of everything you could possibly need!

I had the Mother Earth, Pita/Hummus and my friend had a salad. The Mother Earth was very good but I found it a bit odd that it would cost me an additional $4 to add tofu. Come. On. Be reasonable. I didn't think it'd be worth it so I did without it. It was still good. I can see why a lot of people complain about the price as it adds up very fast for a place like this. My friend enjoyed her salad. The hummus was okay, the pitas were okay. They have a lot of tasty looking things on their menu so I'm looking forward to coming back. 

I firmly believe in accessible healthy diets. Flower child is a step in the right direction, however they can tweak their add on prices a little bit."}
{"text":"Everything is good here! The food is super flavorful, the portion sizes are a bit larger than 'just right' and their drinks are refreshing. The bonus is that it is gluten-free. A perfect place to meet girlfriends for lunch!"}
{"text":"Well, I had a first ever large order that was AMAZING!  Then I went back for a solo To Go that went not so well.  I called and spoke with Amy, the manager, and she was ON IT TO MAKE THIS GAL HAPPY!  Not only did she comp the meal in question before it posted to my account, she gave me a free meal to come back any time I was ready.  I went back today.  WOW!!!  AWESOME BEYOND!!!  She even had me step back to check out my TO Go before bagging that yummiest delight up to be sure it was going to make me happy.  I felt I was treated like a queen and felt like a HUGE queen at home as I devoured every last AMAZING morsel.  This place is 20 stars above.  I was so excited to find them...had a hiccup that was MORE THAN rectified...and have now become a patron for LIFE!!!  LONG LIVE FLOWERCHILD!!!!!  Amy, you are a REAL AND TRUE ROCKSTAR!!!  AWESOME STAFF, FABULOUS ENERGY!!!  BEST EVER and healthy and YUMMY to boot!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!!!  THANK YOU!  HIGH FIVE TO MANAGER AMY!!!!!!  See y'all SOON!!!  :)))  Did I say...LOVE!!!  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Finally! A restaurant in Phoenix that serves delicious organic, vegan and gluten free food. Food is great, layout is beautiful, kombucha on TAP! - and its on my way home from yoga. Doesn't get any better! 

...If you like food that's delicious AND good for you, you won't be disappointed. Check it out!"}

{"text":"Great place for vegans & vegetarians with add-ons for carnivores. The chili sweet potato (side) was sooooo good while the Brussel sprouts were tasty, too. Split those sides along with the flavorful poke bowl (& tofu add-on) for a satisfying lunch for two. We will definitely be back!"}

{"text":"The Best Healthy Organic Restaurant in Phoenix, The Best Chicken fresh from the farm, real Tea made with leaves, the desserts are Gluten free and amazing.  Breakfast is on weekends, a must to go. Everything is awesome."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Can't get over the Pho! I have dreamt of this dish! Absolutely love this place! We travel from Prescott to eat here! Must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out flower child for \"brunch\" on Sunday. But we discovered they don't serve breakfast! :(  boo 

Loved the vibe and decor. The food was fresh, healthy and delicious! So it made up for no breakfast menu! 

Loved the iced teas... Ordered a Mediterranean Salad with Salmon, salmon was very tasty and fresh and the salad was perfect. 

Definitely will be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting. Friendly atmosphere and professional emplyees. The madras curry and the gluten free mac n cheese were very good and delivered promptly.  However I did order the forbidden rice bowl with beef and the meat was serverd cold. As soon as I asked the woman I belive was a manager quickly had my food remade. My only complaint comes from the kitchen serving food well under safe temperatures. Check your thermometers flower child."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The food was delicious and the service was refreshing! Will definitely be back. It was great to have A restaurant that has a healthy menu to go to after my workout."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad thing there. Get a drink they are to die for! Love the curry plate. The corn mash is also amazing. 12/10 would recommend. I come here as much as my budget will allow."}
{"text":"I would have given 3 stars for the food if I had been provided with any dressing for my \"salad\" otherwise known as just lettuce. I had the steak wrap (the rebel) and though the flavor was there (horseradish dressing made it), it was mostly lettuce and onion with a small serving of very tough steak. Not worth $14."}
{"text":"I was talking to a coworker about how much we used to love Pita Jungle and how we miss having healthy lunches as an option and about an hour later I found Flower Child on yelp. We decided to head right over that day and was very happy we did.

My brain imagined a sit down restaurant with servers but when I walked in I was surprised by the set up. I wasn't disappointed by any means just not expecting a walk up counter with serve yourself beverages.

Flower Child deserves 5 stars because of the food, why I gave it 4 was because of the price. I ordered The Mother Earth (delicious by the way, complex flavors but simple foods) and I didn't add a protein just ate as is. I added the simple hummus and an iced tea and paid $21. For lunch. That's insane. I went back a couple days later and got the Mushroom Pho added tofu and had an iced tea and paid $17. 

I just can't bring myself to pay that much money again on lunch. If I was rolling in the dough, I'd say forget it bring on the steak! But for a girl just trying to pay the bills this will be a splurge lunch.

Delicious however, and totally worth it if it's in your price range."}
{"text":"Great way to experience good food and relive the 60's. They served me three warm veggies in one bowl when I ordered three sides.  So flavorful. It was a vegetable salad with no lettuce that I want again. Their eggplant is great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the forbidden rice, which was had just the right amount of spice. The vegetables were crisp and fresh and flavorful. 

We came on Mother's Day and there was a bit of a line, but a server came around and handed waiting customers the rose petal lemonade. The decor is playful and stylish and the whole restaurant has a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Flower Child wasn't anything to write home about, in fact it was rather disappointing. However, we thought we would give it another go & I'm glad we did. The service was friendly and the food was good! I enjoyed the Avocado Toast & my husbands favorite was the Chicken and Chili Glazed Sweet Potatoes (which had a nice little kick to them). Overall everything was nice and it was a pleasant dinner!"}
{"text":"They have plenty of options for vegans as well as omnivores! They cook great tofu as well as delicious steak. Everything is seasoned to perfection!
 There is also plenty of tea to choose from!"}
{"text":"Today was our second time here. Loved it both times! Light healthy TASTY food. Avocado hummus is great! We also enjoyed the arugula and granola salad and the bean quinoa bowl. Place is pricey but worth it. Great flavored teas and juices. Plenty of outdoor seating, wonderful indoor/outdoor concept. So flavorful my husband didn't know it was healthy!"}
{"text":"Fresh and expertly prepared the vegan fare at Flower Child is excellent.  Had roasted veggies with tofu,  a veggie wrap, some hummus appetizer, and a male and apple juice refreshment. All was wonderful."}
{"text":"Omg just heard this blessing of a place is opening on Lennox road in AtL in 2018. I will be living here thank you very much! Their gluten free Mac and cheese even sent my husband home raving. The Brussels sprouts and were also cooked to perfection. I think the best part is the homemade drink options , I had guava lemonade practically spewing out of my nose and veins by the end of the meal! There needs to be 45 of this restaurant in every state! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment. Customer service was professional and courteous. The food dish I had was scrumptious as well as the beverage. I had the plate specialty with chili sweet potato's, asparagus and grass-fed steak with the lavender honey beverage."}
{"text":"This is an interesting concept by the Fox restaurants organization. I felt the food was overpriced and bland."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to go to for lunch! The food is the best and so healthy and delicious. I love the Thai dye wrap and the kombucha on tap. I try to go here once a week for lunch or dinner. It's nice to have a healthy place to eat."}
{"text":"What can I say - I love this place. I tried the sesame soba noodles with mint and sweet pea on Friday and I've been dreaming of it ever since. I am addicted, obsessed, and pleasantly reminding myself that it's at least somewhat healthy. I mean, the mac and cheese is gluten free so that counts for something, right? LOVE"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I wish I had a private chef who would make me this type of food every day! It is a little pricey for the portion size, but the quality and taste is there."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but the prices are very high and the serving sizes are small.

I ate here for the 1st time today and ordered a Bird is teh Word wrap with chicken in it and a side of garlic smashed potatoes.  The garlic smashed potatoes ($4) was actually only about 3 bites of mashed potatoes.  The wrap was good, but then again it wasn't that large.  I didn't order a drink because at $3.50, that seemed a bit high.  Anyway, I spent $17.38 and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Flower Child is my second favorite Fox concept, and never ceases to amaze me. Staff is all extremely friendly and helpful, food is delightful,and management is always around to lend a helping hand and give out free smiles :) I love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"In town for a meeting and found time to eat at Flower Child twice:  it's the sort of restaurant that makes one consider a move to Scottsdale permanently.  Food is fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  I follow AIP and they were happy to modify my meal to ensure compliance (Vegan Cesar Salad with Salmon, no seeds no tomatoes).   Don't be alarmed by the line out the door as they are very efficient and unlike other fast casual concepts (think Chipotle and Panera) you don't have to stress out over where to sit: a hostess will direct you to an open table and the food is delivered within moments.  The fresh Kombucha was refreshing. A \"miss\" and it's an interesting one is the decision to leave calorie and nutrition information off the menu.  Even if loaded with disclaimers, calorie, fat, sugar and protein information would have been great to know- Mod Market does this in Colorado on the back of the receipt.  I hope this concept expands to other areas."}
{"text":"I eat at this Flower Child all the time.  Had a rough patch in the beginning but the food is pretty consistent now.  Still not as good as the Shea location but a lot closer to home."}
{"text":"Love the lemonade! I've had all of their bowls and they are yummy and filling! The service is pretty fast as well, I've only ordered To Go, but there's a nice area to sit and wait and it came out pretty quick!"}
{"text":"I love flower child, the ambience is great and the food is creative and delicious. The food can get a bit pricey when you add a protein but their tofu is on point!"}
{"text":"A+! Loved everything about this place! We were there on day 3 and everything was great. Super fast and friendly service. Food was the bomb and it's totally affordable. I had the chopped salad with chicken and my kids had chicken, broccoli and Mac n cheese. I've never seen my 1 yr old chow down on a kids meal like that. Felt like a summer garden party when we walked in. We live close by and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch.. Absolutely amazing. Try the flying avocado wrap and the chopped salad with beef.... Don't leave without trying the Mac n cheese and the quinoa sweet corn... This place is the best... Service, food was just outstanding...."}
{"text":"Flower Child? What has happened to me? I used to be such an In n Out, Carolina's kinda guy. Has the desert softened me? When I entered and looked around I was surprised it wasn't full of California Soccer Mom's who love participation trophies. Oh, I'm so going to hear it for that, damn I need a filter. 

Flower Child has an open and bright restaurant that is great for business meetings, quick friend lunches or planning neighborhood quail crossings (do flower children do that?). I ordered take out since I didn't want to commit to a sit down without seeing my surroundings. 

I ordered the Thai Cashew Bowl with some chicken. Quinoa (spelling, grain?) with jalapeno, snap peas, celery, mushroom, cashews and Thai basil!! Holy shit these saguaro hugging hippies (ouch) can make me forget about methane producing cow burgers!! The quinoa was the perfect texture with crisp snap peas and spicy jalapenos. Great flavor with the tender chicken. I would highly recommend adding a meat or tofu for a little heartier meal. I would have given this place 5 stars, but for the price I would have expected more meat and a little bigger portion. I just came back from a run and was absolutely starving. What's not to love about eating healthy and the good news is I didn't smell any patchouli oil!!"}
{"text":"everything here is just absolutely delicious!! the meat is always well seasoned, as well as the medium rare steak. The mother of the earth bowl as well as the forbidden rice is a top seller. i purchased the family meal with a small of the steak, and the 3 large sides. which consisted of the corn quinoa, the bean sprouts, and the sweet potatoes and i was in heaven,,flower child never fails to impress! the lemonade changes daily, and the basil lemonade and the cilantro lemonades are wonderful to the taste buds!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you are looking for fresh and delicious you came to the right place. Wonderful vegan and vegetarian choices along side meat dishes. Everything on the menu is good so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life?!  This is my new favorite restaurant and I have to admit, I've been there a couple times a week.  Flower Child introduces everyone to the food revolution - organic and local food.  They utilize the natural lighting provided by all the windows and adds to the wonderful environment the restaurant has created.  

The word is out on the street and people are checking Flower Child out.  It can be busy at lunch time but with some patience, you too, can enjoy a delicious, locally grown meal.  

My go to meal with include the Sweet Corn Quinoa.  This is amazing!!!  Whoever created this dish needs an award!  The Mix and Match allows you to taste one, two or three dishes.  You can add a protein to the bowl.  The best  combo has to be the Sweet Corn Quinoa and Sweet Potatoes with Salmon.  

Flower Child has several menu options available to the whole family.  They have several fresh salads and noodle  bowls available.  If you love a healthy drink, they have Kombucha on tap.  

Make Flower Child your next stop to healthy eating.

{"text":"I want the owners to know that I'm moving from Henderson to Summerlin just so I can be closer to this delightful, delicious restaurant. I'm not joking.

FINALLY a Vegas restaurant that prepares fresh, tasty, and healthy dishes. The food is fantastic -- bold flavors and balanced textures. So happy to see playfulness and diversity on a menu. We have been in serious need of something like this. 

Decor and atmosphere are relaxing and charming. 

This is a perfect restaurant. 

The Rebel was just a tad bit salty...my only criticism."}
{"text":"Great quality food and fun atmosphere. I had the avocado hummus and the quinoa salad- both were delicious.  
Great job Fox restaurants on another amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Flower Child as one of the latest Fox Restaurant concepts. I order from Flower Child on nights I don't feel like cooking and want to pick up something healthy.

Flower child is the affordable fast casual relative of True Foods. It delivers up delicious vegetables that you can group together for a healthy meal. Think heirloom tomato and watermelon salads, turmeric and curried cauliflower paired with protein (antibiotic free chicken or grass fed steak) or sustainable salmon. Also, I love their fresh juices. 

The space is lovely- and very excited that they are in North CenPho!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, yum....well, you get the idea!  Except for finding the ordering area a bit awkward (especially for first timers or someone who doesn't know what they want), I enjoyed everything about Flower Child.  My meal - the Turkey Avocado Gouda Wrap - was a wonderful experience.  And then came the chocolate gluten free cake!  A. MAZ. ING."}
{"text":"We loved the idea of having a healthy restaurant that served fresh food down the street from us. We had high hopes and we really wanted to like this restaurant. Unfortunately, the quality of food was good but it didn't meet our expectations. Maybe it was hyped up too much, but we genuinely wanted to enjoy flower child. When we arrived the place was packed. We decided to order the side of eggplant, broccoli, asparagus, and the avocado toast because we weren't too hungry. The sides were very small and they were $4 a piece which was a little pricey. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so over priced. The avocado toast was pretty good other than the fact that the piece of toast that it was on was a little burnt but the toppings had a good flavor. The restaurant has a trendy feel and overall is beautiful. The service was outstanding as well but I wish we enjoyed the food a little more especially for the price."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I have been to the north Scottsdale and central Phoenix locations multiple times and highly recommend. 

From the decor to the healthy food to the super fast service. This place is fast casual dining with tons of healthy options (organic wine and gluten free desserts to name a few) and fair pricing. They also have a great family take away option. 

I've tried multiple dishes from their mix and match menu. I especially liked the sweet potato and green bean dishes. Also enjoyed the avocado hummus. Grab a glass of wine and relax on the cute, french-style patio!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Everyone here was so nice! Was greeted right away and was thanked as I was leaving. It was my first time here and the woman up front explained everything briefly to me. Super cute place, def my type of place. 
Food was delicious!! Had the creamed corn with quinoa which was so delicious!! Smashed potatoes which was also good and the crispy asparagus which was cooked properly! Nice and crispy and not soggy at all. Also ordered a side of Salmon which was also tasty! For a drink i had what i believe was the white peach lemonade? Very good, however a little on the sweet side. I def will be returning as well as making this a regular go to spot :)
Kinda on the pricy side tho."}
{"text":"The super fast attentive service, great smiles/attitudes of the employees (especially at 8:45p on a Friday night) prevented me from leaving a rating of less than 3 stars.  This isn't my kind of place but I went with an open mind.. I figured it was all rabbit food (it is) but I when I saw that you could get chicken (and the high ratings) I thought \"let's try something new\".. a nice chicken salad can't be that bad, especially from a place that specializes in salads...I ordered something that is apparently super popular, a Kale salad with some fruit in it, and I added chicken.. I received a little container with chopped up kale, a single slice of grapefruit, maybe a single slice of an apple thinly sliced into 2 pieces, and perhaps 5 pieces of chicken, each about the size of of a small apple slice.. I tried eating it but the chicken was as chewy as bubble gum.. I swallowed it thinking I just got a piece with a little fat..tried again.. same..tried a third time and I spit it out, and tried again.. strike 4.. after the 4th piece of chewy chicken out of 5, I believed it to be undercooked.  I drank my 3.50 tea, left everything, and walked out, having spent nearly 18.00.  (Yes the salad was 13.50).  The environment and customers are exactly what you are thinking for a vegan friendly place in Scottsdale called \"Flower Child\" that only sells salads.  I already feel uneasy from what I ate..I'll lower this review later if I actually get sick.. very nice attentive employees though!  I'm off to buy a burger."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now and each time the food and service is amazing!
The first time I got the Vietnamese Crunch salad which was so good. The second time I got the gluten free Mac n cheese and curry cauliflower which were both delicious. I also got the Thai Cashew Quinoa which was out of this world! Definitely one of my faves. Going back there again today! Can't wait to try more items!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great menu! Organic and healthy. Got the Mother Earth bowl with grass fed steak. Super good. Would like to try a salad next time. Tons of options. Fresh juices at beverage area. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for when I want something healthy and delicious.  It's not the cheapest option, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for when I want something healthy and delicious.  It's not the cheapest option, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I came today on my lunch and oh my gosh!!! This restaurant is to DIE FOR!!!! Organic everything. Even the ketchup! KETCHUP!!!! Love that they had the vegan ORGANIC pho! I'm getting that next time, this time I had the hummus and the pita bread! I love that the pita bread is so thin! It was awesome! The tea and my hummus were a perfect lunch! And, the service was perfection!!!!"}
{"text":"Very exciting that this location is now opened, as of today! I absolutely love Flower Child and I love the vegan options on the menu. They have a seasonal menu and support local businesses, which is great! This is a place where everyone can eat, whether you are seeking gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, or none of the above. This location is great and parking is much more convenient than the 40th Street location! YEAH!!"}
{"text":"We had a reasonable hopes coming here, as it had a perfect five star record, so far. We did not realize it had just opened last week. The place was crowded, and yet we got our food in just a couple of minutes.... and the food was totally thrilling! It was an explosion of various excellent distinct flavors. My wife and I both had the Mother Earth Bowl, and did not elect to add additional protein, as it already had some hemp seeds. It was mind-blowingly good!  Do yourself a favor and try this place out!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just had lunch here and it was my first time coming. We came about 12:30 on a Tuesday and it was super busy. They were swift in taking our order and bringing it out. The first thing I noticed was the generous amount of seating (and comfy chairs) which was nice. 

The food was delicious! I got the Flying Avocado wrap and a Raspberry Ginger Lemonade. We also shared the Avocado Hummus which I honestly could eat a whole bowl of!! Overall, it's a great place to have lunch, but only when I'm feeling like dropping some cash. Their prices really push it compared to most other restaurants with similar ingredients. I don't think they're that extraordinary for a $25 lunch meal -- and for that I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Ordered the steak wrap and it was so gross. Way too much spread and very greasy. For a \"healthy\" place this meal was not good. I also spent $15 on it."}
{"text":"Finally, quick healthy food. I absolutely love this restaurant.  I just wish there was a location in Tempe. Decor is very hipster. Anything with sweet potatoes is a good choice. I believe they use local ingredients, which is awesome."}
{"text":"5 STARS! Finally Vegas gets a quality, healthy and clean place to eat! I love everything about this place-the atmosphere, the very friendly staff and of course the excellent food. I LOVE how the kitchen staff must wash hands before entering the kitchen.
I am a big fan of True Food Kitchen (which I believe that is the sister restaurant or at least used to be) and I honestly think Flower Child is much better than True Food. The only thing I would recommend is maybe adding a hot appetizer to the menu, perhaps the edamame dumplings from True Food kitchen or something similar but everything else is PERFECT. Please stay consistent and I will be here a couple of times a week!!!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this gem!   I visited 2 locations, have had several meals, brought several friends and all good.   Refreshing to find good-tasting, not too pricey food out."}
{"text":"Cheers and more power to restaurants that offer healthy options that actually taste good! 

When I try a place during their grand opening, I set low expectations and bump my patience level all the way up - I expect things to not go perfectly since they're working on kinks and all that. But Flower Child managed to pleasantly surprise me. They got their act together and things are going smoothly like a well-oiled machine. Service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious. The place was packed but no errors/ chaos occurred.

They have daily soup, salads, plates, bowls, wraps which you can add your favorite protein (chicken, salmon, grass-fed steak, or tofu) to. They have sweet treats as well. To drink, they have seasonal lemonade, iced tea, kombucha (on tap), wine, and beer.

Thai Cashew Quinoa with Salmon Bowl:
My bowl came out smoking hot - I got a good facial. Very tasty Asian flavors with a bit of a kick from the jalapeño. Lots of textures and flavors. The salmon was nowhere dry or over cooked at all - it was perfection! 5/5

Spicy Japanese Eggplant, Sautéed Spinach + Grass-fed Steak Plate:
With their plates, you can pick 1, 2 or 3 veg/ grains and add a protein. The steak is lean but tender and flavorful. The veggies were delightful with a bit of heat and refreshing tang. 5/5

Brownie:
Gluten-free...I don't have celiac disease so, I'm not afraid/ avoidant of gluten. But if you do have celiac disease, this is the sweet treat for you! Good texture and very mo!$t. 5/5

Lemon Olive Oil Cupcake:
Not only did we try 1 cupcake, we had to get a dozen! I've had lemon Olive oil cupcakes before that only have a hint of lemon and olive oil + regular oil - not good. These cupcakes were so good. Strong flavors. Sweet and savory at the same time. 5/5

Chocolate Chip Cookie:
Another gluten-free item. Made with cashews, coconut and other ingredients without tasting too coconutty. Crunchy. 4/5

One of the highlights for me is their drink station. They have different kinds of teas and lemonades. They're all good and you can get creative by mixing different flavors.

They have neat wall murals, flowers, and little details such as a \"yoga mat parking\". So, after a good sweat sesh, this is a good spot to eat at with your gym squad."}
{"text":"This was the second time I ate here and I came back hoping I just caught them on an off day. Unfortunately not. Today was just as disappointing as the first time. It's a shame because the interior is adorable and the menu sounds delicious.
The steak was stringy and over cooked, the smashed potatoes were runny, the broccoli was limp and the corn with quinoa was inedible (that may just be my point of view about quinoa, although I have liked it at other places).

April 23, 2017 - on a subsequent visit, the food was substantially better tasting and much fresher. I had a turkey wrap which was quite good and a side of quinoa and corn which was served hot and flavorful. The staff is friendly and the interior is shabby chic adorable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch date and it is a cute, relaxing restaurant. The food was good and I love the outdoor seating. It's a nice place to stop by and grab a healthy bite."}
{"text":"Darling atmosphere and very friendly staff.  The food selections are great!  All healthy and you basically create your own meal.  It is a little pricey, but one of my favorite new healthy restaurants."}
{"text":"Great healthy food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Overpriced and crowded. Every time I go here they screw up my order. Don't go here if you're in a rush or you expect your order to be right the first time. I love the gluten-free options and California fresh cuisine, but I am fed up with the unpredictability of my guest experience."}
{"text":"Flower Child is is an awesome addition to the recently opened North Italia in the freshly remodeled Rampart Commons. Fresh and vibrant food, prepared perfectly. Absolutely love this place, have been back every weekend since they have opened!"}
{"text":"This place is killer! I loved the Phx one but this one is much more accessible for me. The atmosphere is nothing but good vibes as well as the people that work here. The food is outstanding! I'm
Vegetarian and this is always a great option. Love the sides. The tea and lemonade are delicious. There treats are great as well. This is a must try!! They have family style and Togo."}
{"text":"My first visit to Flower Child was in California and I liked it, so I decided to try it again while I was visiting Phoenix, which is where this concept was first launched. The menu is quite Californian, serving salad bowls, focusing on organic and sustainable produce, having vegan options, and adopting a farm to table approach. It appeared to be somewhere between an Urban Plates and Tender Greens based one appearance

For dinner, I had started off with a green curry cauliflower soup, followed by a Thai cashew quinoa bowl with grass-fed steak. I also added a side of turmeric cauliflower. The food here was definitely not on the bland side as I initially thought of a place that promotes \"health and wellness\". Everything I ordered was surprisingly very savory and slightly overly salty in my opinion. The soup was very flavorful, and tasted similar to the Thai green curry that you would pair with rice. It was loaded with ginger but balanced with the sweetness of the coconut. Unfortunately, due to the amount of coconut milk added, the soup itself was rather heavy. My appetite for the main course then dropped by 50%.

The Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl with Grass-Fed Steak did not look anything like a Thai dish but it sure tasted similar to a Pad Kee Mao due to the seasonings used. Think of the rice noodles in that Thai stir fry substituted with quinoa, then mixed with a combination of the sweet soy sauce, fish sauce, and garlic flavor profile. There's also a hint of basil and charred onions. Very creative and tasty, but the strong salty taste became too heavy for me after a few bites. Not exactly a cleansing type of dish. I think I would have been better off sharing this bowl instead of finishing it by myself.

Then there was the turmeric cauliflower, which was solid but nothing special. Somewhat soggy, a bit overspiced in my opinion, better to eat it with something starchy to neutralize the saltiness.

Amongst the other fast-casual restaurants I know of that promote a healthy/vegan/organic lifestyle, Flower Child is probably the least health-conscious. The ingredients may be wholesome, but they were cooked with heavy hands of sauces, spices, and salt during my visit, not exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"Dining solo and with an empty fridge, I was on the hunt for a healthy spot near home. A quick search on Yelp, and I found Flower Child. 

Oddly enough, I've been through the plaza where it is located probably a dozen times but never noticed it. It is located right by Steak 44 and in the same shopping center where Aj's is.

First thoughts upon walking inside.. vibrant, chic, casual, and a nice garden-vibe going on. Definitely great spot to meet a few friends for a casual and fresh lunch/dinner.

I went with the Organic Kale Salad. A lot of flavors going on..everything from smoked almonds (yum!) to Aged White Cheddar, to grapefruit and granny smith apples.

To be honest, the grapefruit was just too overpowering - way too much of a sour flavor that collided with everything else. Unfortunately, it kind of ruined the salad for me because as I tried to pick around it, the juices started to get on the rest of what I was trying to eat.

The aged white cheddar was DELICIOUS but came in these ginormous cubes throughout the salad. I wish that it was crumbled so that the flavor was more consistent with each bite instead of just getting an entire mouthful of it all at once.

All the other ingredients blended quite nicely, including the dressing.

I'm excited to come here again, but will go with a different dish on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Has a great vibe and healthy meal options. The Mother Earth bowl is definitely one of my favorites. I also had their vegan truffles, both the raspberry and date, and they are to die for. Great for brunch, lunch, or dinner, and they also do carry out (which is super convenient and sometimes I order a few things for lunch during the week)."}
{"text":"Whichever property developer picked the location for Flower Child could not have done a better job. This is a health-nut's dream restaurant, and they placed it at the center of a triangle of gyms and health clubs. Smart.

Flower Child has pulled off a difficult trifecta: it's trendy, healthy and delicious. 

The Healthy:
Everything is fresh, locally sourced and organic. Even the staff. There really isn't a single thing on the menu that is bad for you. Lots of fresh vegetable options, lots of healthy grains and rices, lots of healthy proteins, and not a lot of cheese or pasta. This is food as it should be. You won't leave feeling engorged or disgusting. Just full and satisfied.

The Trendy:
Normally this warrants a degree of trepidation from me. Oftentimes trendiness comes at the sacrifice of tastiness. Fortunately this is not the case. I have a natural prejudice against ingredients like quinoa. Do people eat it because they really enjoy it, or because psychologically it feels good to eat \"healthy.\" But Matt, the host, recommended it so I ordered it, and tried it, and it was incredible. If you are going to order anything, order the corn and quinoa.

The Delicious:
Again, the corn and quinoa is incredible. Also good is the avocado hummus, the steak, and the glazed sweet potatoes. The broccoli is just simple steamed broccoli, but it was fresh and still firm and nicely balanced the meal. If you're a little crunchy and feeling adventurous, don't miss out on the kambucha. It's an acquired taste I haven't acquired yet, but don't let that hold you back.

I like you, Flower Child."}
{"text":"Still LOVE this place. Tried the Mother Earth with steak this time round and it was to die for. I would highly recommend it. Also, the service here is outstanding.

The best part? They have a great PET-FRIENDLY patio!"}
{"text":"Yummy healthy options. One of my favorites. Very conscious of food allergies and intolerances."}
{"text":"Flower child is a staple in my casual food book! I have stopped here for lunch and tried several dishes, none have disappointed. The service at this location is always super friendly! Today I stopped in for dinner with a girlfriend and ordered the Mother Earth bowl, no grains, extra veggies and no miso glaze on the sweet potato add chicken. It was delicious! The combination of pesto, chicken and the soft sweet potato is great. Despite my picky ish order it came out perfect - except the avocado was missing! For how much you pay at this restaurant I was a little bummed but super hungry and ate it without noticing the missing ingredient until afterwards. 

They offer breakfast on the weekends, lunch and dinner. They also have a great grab and go cold case with coffees, juices, kombuchas, etc. They serve kombucha on tap, gluten free sweets and local spirits! Very Instagram worthy decor on the inside. Great spot for healthy food!"}
{"text":"I didn't hate this place, but I wasn't particularly wow'ed either. For my birthday, I decided to try something new that I'd heard good things about and with a friend that has a gluten allergy and cannot have dairy, this seemed like a pretty decent place that had good food plus a special diet accommodation. I will say that the atmosphere is spot on and exactly what I love. The food was great, but I was pretty bummed about the portion size when considering what it cost. I totally understand that healthier options are often a bit more costly than a different restaurant, but I came here starving and left still hungry. This place would be perfect for someone who wants something a bit light and not a full on meal - maybe after coming from yoga or the gym? Again, I don't hate this place and I might return in the future, but for the drive + price, I'll try something else!"}
{"text":"Fabulous. Healthy and delicious vegan food. Great vibe. Staff is friendly and food always comes quickly. I'm so glad there isn't one in Denver!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it for sure. When you order the bowls and you see every little beautiful vegetable cut and prepped I just think holy cow! The prep work in cutting all these up must be astronomical!! I will never have the time or effort to prep veggies like this at home so it's 100% worth it for me at least.  I had the tofu forbidden rice bowl and I loved it. It's a very good portion - I could barely finish it :) the sides are nice to share too, although the ones we picked weren't the healthiest-but they tasted good! The corn and the Mac n cheese were yummy and so were the roasted sweet potatoes. The only thing I don't like about it is it's really loud inside, when it's busy--and it's always busy! You can barely hear!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this spot numerous times and never got a chance to eat here because it was in between eating times.  Well that changed a week or so ago when I was in the area.  It's in a great shopping center of a gourmet grocery store and lots of other stores and eating options.  

I love the order yourself places where you don't have to wait for someone to come to your table.  Came with a family relative and had an easy time finding veggie oriented items on the menu. It's grouped into salads plates and bowls.  The salad section alone was pretty amazing I wanted to try everything.  They had a kale salad a veggie salad a Vietnamese crunch salad a Mediterranean one, a Brussels and squash. They even have one called vegan ingredient.  They also list on the menu that you can sub out any dressing for their lemon avo dressing that is sugar free and simple.  

Their plates are really innovative in that you pick one two or three items from the menu to make a plate.  The more you pick the price drops down to $3 a plate which is to me a good deal considering everything is organic.  

We tried the vegan salad, the forbidden black rice bowl with veggies, and the vegan poke bowl.  Basically you pick your table and they deliver your food when ready.  

The space is well lit and modern with cool artwork on the walls and an open kitchen where you can see all the chefs in action making the dishes.  The time to get your dishes was not that long.  Considering it was pretty packed at lunch I was really impressed how on top they were with keeping up with all the orders. 

Food we ordered was really tasty and well presented.  The forbidden rice is a must get dish.  So many flavors and super healthy with all the veggies.  The vegan salad was also large in size and very tasty.  Pole bowl was simple but very innovative.  

I'm so glad I got a chance to stop here and I think this could very well become my go to spot to hang out when in Phoenix.  Good job bravo!"}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say. The service was impeccable, the ambiance is breath taking, and the food was to die for. Let's go in to each subject. The service was extremely quick and up forward. My waitress, Izzy, was a sunshine of smile and happiness. She made the experience that much better. The perfect waitress and was there whenever I needed. The ambiance matched the whole vibe perfectly. An organic feel and vegetation paintings matched perfect. To top it off, the food made my taste buds dance like an interpretive dancer. Everything sat perfect in my mouth and stomach and left me feeling full and satisfied. Overall amazing experience. 11/10 completely recommend."}
{"text":"Flower Child is a vegetarian' and vegan's delight!  Many choices!

After reviewing the menu which is on boards high above the counter at the entrance (there are also printed ones menus), your selection is given to the person at the counter.  Upon ordering a number is given and you proceed to get drinks at the end of the counter.  The food is prepared in an open area behind glass panels.  The restaurant initially gives the appearance of a cafeteria and I suppose it is, except the food is delivered to your table.  One pet peeve ... immediately after ordering you pay the bill and the option to add a tip is presented.  First why would I tip prior to receiving the service and second why would I tip in a cafeteria?  I have no issue with leaving a tip to the wait person who comes to the table to refill drinks however that didn't happen at Flower Child.  

My dining partner (not Knife) and I both ordered Bowls ... a Thai Cashew Quinoa with chicken and a Mother Earth with salmon.  At $14 and $16 dollars, I felt the price was high for the size of the portion.  Don't get me wrong, the portion size was a 'normal' size not the over sized portions we have unfortunately all gotten used to.  For the size of the meal the price is a bit high.

The quality of the food was good and mostly tasty.  Although fellow diner who got the Thai Cashew Quinoa would have liked a bit more 'crunch' in the bowl.  She said once the cashews were gone some of the flavor also disappeared.  My Mother Earth was a great choice and I thoroughly enjoyed every morsel!

We dined at the Flower Child location at 44 St/Camelback; there are a few other locations in the Valley, which I will be trying in the future.

{"text":"I want to preface by saying I'm not vegan, gluten free, or a particularly healthy person but I absolutely LOVE this place. Let alone the fact that if you do have dietary restrictions, they accommodate you no problem. Quality food, great setting, and super friendly people. How could you not love it???

You order at the front and they give you a number and deliver your food, so you get to pick where you want to sit. There is ample indoor and outdoor seating. 

I've leaned towards wraps here, but on my recent visit I opted for a plate. With their plates you can pick one two or three of their selections (veggies, rice, avocado, Mac and cheese, etc) and even add a protein should you wish. I ended up with Salmon, brown rice, and avocado. So so SO good. Food is fresh and the salmon was cooked just right. Honestly to die for. My friends had salads and they raved about them too. 

They have a great selection of unsweetened ice tea so I was set on the drink front. I noticed they have some organic wines too that I'll have to try sometime. 

It can get pretty crowded here at peak lunch time and dinner, but still worth it always. It can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but you really do pay for quality."}
{"text":"The decor is lovely.  Food is very healthy, but taste so-so considering the price."}
{"text":"Good as hell. Didn't even taste like vegetables. I've pretty much been on the Atkins diet my whole life and this was still great!!"}
{"text":"Flower Child has always been my go-to for a healthy and quick meal. I am giving three stars though for two reasons.... No more Pho, AND no more salmon entree. These were two of my favorite options and both of them are gone. Bring them back, please!

If you are going here.... it's not a bad choice at all. The atmosphere is casual, I typically come here after a hike or workout. Service is always great. The Mother Earth is the last dish standing that I love. The tea and lemonade selections are unique and delicious, and the GT Kombucha is fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!!! Pro tip: lines can sometimes be a bit long during lunch, but the food is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"MY HAPPY PLACE! I've fell in love with this place from the moment I saw it. The logo to the the aesthetics was beautifully crafted. It's a self order and self seating restaurant, but they great you with great knowledge about the menu and help you when you are seated. 

I've been here a few times since it opened and it's never been a disappointment. I've tried the Organic Kale, Mother Earth & Vegan Poke with Salmon. They all been great and I've tried the Kombucha on tap.

Today we went in on Mother's Day and it was the prime time for lunch, but they took care of my mother and I with the line and table. It was great touch to their service and productivity."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The food is fresh, healthy, well priced and delicious.  Husband loved the pho and the forbidden rice with salmon was so good. I'm so happy to have a healthy option in this part of town."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The food is always so fresh, this is so nice and the selection of food can accommodate vegan to meat eater. If you like Pho, this is my favorite place to get it. No fishy taste at all and it's vegan! I'm actually addicted to it and have to have us a couple of times a month. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My newest favorite lunch spot. I love all the choices, I havent had anything that wasn't delicious yet. Also, I was super impressed by how quickly they move people in and out and how the workers seemed so on top of things from the opening week. My favorites are the sweet corn quinoa, the indian cauliflower, and the forbidden rice bowl with shaved beef. Heavenly! I'm so happy this restaurant exists!"}
{"text":"Great HEALTHY food. 

The Rebel wrap is my favorite.... sometimes with a side of gluten free Mac & Cheese!! 

Everyone raves about the lemonade however I have yet to try it!!  ;)"}
{"text":"High-quality ingredients and healthy but not so healthy you wouldn't want to eat there. Flower child is my go-to a few times a week after I load up on their gift cards from Costco. By the time I'm burnt out, my gifts card is spent, wait a month or two and repeat."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is delicious and healthy at the same time. Just taste healthy and full of goodness. great concept!"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious vegetarian options! Reasonable prices and great selection! My goto dine-in or take out healthy food!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch. Absolutellllyyyyyyyy love this place. They have the best mint lemonade and their veg out wrap was phenomenal, with a side salad. The girl at the register was very nice, very patient because it was my first time there, since I was asking 25 questions. Haha. 

I can't wait to come back and try the other lunch specials:)"}
{"text":"Literally beyond excited that this is 2.3 seconds away from me. No longer have to go to Scottsdale for flower child. Yayyyyyy!

Seriously, I love everything on the menu  (vegetarian of course) tofu, please. The salad to the rice and to the wraps. AND THEY HAVE MUSHROOM PHO! It's a must. *smiley face* 

Every time I come, we always sit outside, great atmosphere and love the energy here. 

I love the lemonade stands. So many yummy drinks to choose from. So if your indecisive, pick two and mix that baby together.  Haha. It's perfect.

Keep on coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Ok - late night, avoiding some homework, so of course I was reminded that I had wanted to make a plug for my new favorite restaurant...Flower Child. At 44th St and Camelback, totally yum. Pretty, relaxing, easy-going and delicious! I think I ate my whole week's worth of veggies in one lunch. Golden beets and avocados, sweet potato soup with chickpeas and tomatoes, roasted cauliflower with tumeric and dates (my fav), and an amazing kale/celery/ginger/lemon juice. Olivia had an amazing salad, my friend had a great pho soup with this insane anise basil...

Ok, now I am hungry. I am going to go have an apple... and be sad because it's not roasted cauliflower or sweet potato soup."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  The skinny Cobb is so good I can't make myself order anything else.  My favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for healthy eating.  Go to postinos if you want wine with you meal tho."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. I'm on a very restrictive diet right now, and eating out is incredibly hard. I came to Flower Child looking for something that could fit my diet and the head chef himself went with me through the menu and the options I could have, and made sure everything was perfect. The food was amazing, and I'm so touched by the help I received. Thank you thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is the third time we've come here . Have had something different each time and it's all been great. My wife has had salads each time and loves them all. I tend to go more the protein route. The staff are always friendly. And there is just a vibe to this place that feels good. People eating here look happy and somehow more healthy. Weird!"}
{"text":"It's been one year since my last not-so-good review and they've come a LONG way, great job!  Staff is excellent as is the food!!!  My kind of place....healthy yet tasty!"}
{"text":"Great salads! The avocado hummus is also soooo good. We tried the cob and the Mediterranean salads. We're so glad we did!"}
{"text":"I love Flower Child. My mom and I came here for my birthday lunch. I always get the sweet potatoes and a side of grilled tofu. They know how to prepare tofu!  This time I also got the spinach which was excellent!  

My mom got her usual flying avocado wrap. I had a bite and it is wonderful. I love the smoked Gouda. We both had the ice tea which was excellent and I'm not usually an iced tea drinker.  

The service was excellent and the cashier who took my order was very friendly. The downside was it was very busy so it was quite loud. Despite that I love going to Flower Child!  I wish there was one in the East Valley!  Please open one in Chandler."}
{"text":"Love, love love!  Came here for lunch on Sunday, and it was so nice.  The weather was perfect, and the windows were open.  It had a very light, inviting, and open atmosphere.

I ordered the sweet potatoes and with a side of tofu.  It was excellent.  Best sweet potatoes I've ever had.  The tofu was seasoned perfectly and grilled.  I can't wait to come back here!  

Service was excellent!  I really enjoyed myself here, and I am looking forward to becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Very good food & hardworking servers! I searched online for a place that was casual, had gluten free options, and was healthy and modern. This place fit the bill! Upon entering, it reminds me of a \"ladies who lunch\" locale mixed with a Southern California menu vibe. I really liked the avocado wrap (made into a salad, no gluten), organic smashed potatoes, and gluten free mac and cheese. The restaurant serves 2 types of organic wine, and a few types of beer. I had the organic red wine, but it wasn't as good as a Bonterra wine. I would probably skip the wine next time, since they have so many other (non-alcoholic) beverage options!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food and adorable venue.  Sitting outside felt like a European cafe and despite the heat was very cool and shaded.  The food was UNBELIEVABLE.  I had the Mother Earth Bowl and it was sweet, tangy, filling, and very nutritious.  I am already planning a second visit and I will definitely have the same thing and sit in the same place."}
{"text":"OK, THIS VENUE IS LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!

I LOVE everything about this place!  The ambiance, decor, service and especially the food!! 

The large open dining area is casual yet very chic, comfy and very inviting. 

You walk in and there are two areas to order. One cashier (far left) is for carry-out, and the other two cashiers (right) are for dine in orders. They were quite busy, and I appreciated how patient the cashier was with me as I tried to decide what to order from their extensive menu. I'm not a fan of raw kale, but my girlfriend highly recommended it so we ordered the kale salad and avocado toast, which I love. You pay for your meal and they give you a number for your order to place on your table. 

Even before the food arrived, I enjoyed just sitting there and soaking in the upbeat, vibrant atmosphere! I tried a bite of the kale salad and instantly regretted that I did not order it for myself! The fibrous, chewy spine of the kale was removed and the leafy green was finely chopped and I loved it, raw, to my surprise! The citrusy light dressing, mild cheeses and seeds made it an amazing flavorful and textural combination, and a culinary delight for my palate! I'm craving it now as I write about it now.

If you are in the area, definitely check it out. However, it is worth checking out regardless which side of town you are coming from!"}
{"text":"As good as the food is here this location is rife with energy vampires lurking to suck your energy at every turn. Maybe that's just scottsdale but this place is a cesspool for unsavories vamping about ready to suck your energetic

Now I have to to ding them another star for taking too damn long. This is the 2nd or 3rd time ive had an order that took way too long where people who ordered after me got food before me. The insolence if such experience is unacceptable and now the food is too hot to eat because they obviously forgot to prep the food and now I have burning hot food. I will lose 40 minutes in this place"}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to look at the menu before coming here so I didn't know what to expect. I came for a team building lunch with a couple people from work. We got there around noon and parking was terrible. I would recommend ride sharing when coming so you can get dropped off right in front. Normally I'm not a fan of restaurants that have you order before and then find a table, but they made it super easy and helped us find a table outside. I ordered a plate combo with Mac and Cheese, Asparagus and Salmon. To drink I went with the seasonal basil lemonade which was delicious. Everything on my plate was good, but next time I will get the asparagus without the ginger. This was probably the best salmon I ever had -- it was cooked perfectly. Restrooms were clean and private and the decor overall was super cute. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Flower child is always consistently delicious and nutritious. I never feel guilty about ordering whatever i want on the menu because i know I'm going to get a filling, healthy meal with high quality, fresh ingredients every time. The menu also changes seasonally so you're always getting the freshest selection. Today i had a mushroom pho noodle soup which was unbelievably delicious. Can't go wrong with any of their salads -- the Skinny Cobb is my favorite. It's a bit pricy to add my favorite protein (steak) but it's always delicious. Their wraps are also excellent and their daily soups and grain bowls never disappoint either. Overall, my wallet wouldn't want me to eat here every week but my taste buds and waste line wouldn't mind one bit. Delicious, healthy food."}
{"text":"It isn't quite summertime in Phoenix yet, but with temperatures already hitting the triple digits it certainly feels like it.  This is the time of year when I ditch the heavy, deep-fried everything for lighter meals, so it was the perfect time to finally give Flower Child a whirl.

I decided to get there a little early to beat any possible lunch crowd, as I'd read on Yelp that it can get very crowded. 10 minutes prior to opening and there were already a dozen people waiting. Wow. This is quite the popular place. The line moved quickly, and there were employees handing out samples of their Flower Girl Lemonade as we waited. Employees were also going through the line asking if patrons had any questions. Ok, ok. I'm starting to really like you folks.  Once I reached the counter I knew exactly what I wanted. I was given a number, I found a table, and had a seat.  Literally moments (felt like only seconds) later my food arrived at my table by a set of happy hands attached to a smiling face. 

The Food.
I basically got 3 sides, which came together in a large bowl.  

RED CHILI GLAZED SWEET POTATO:
If one more place makes an amazing sweet potato dish, I'll be forced to stop my incessant hating on this vegetable.  This dish was highly delectable. My eyes may or may not have rolled into the back of my head after first bite.  It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy, with neither flavor overpowering the other. Excellent flavor. Superb!

SAUTÉED SPINACH:
I requested extra garlic and it was perfect.  No bland, rabbit leaves here.  Flavorful, lightly seasoned to perfection, and cooked just right, this dish is Popeye approved.  (These cooks should teach a certain \"soul food\" restaurant how to properly execute sautéed spinach.) 

INDIAN SPICED CAULIFLOWER:
I requested this dish without the dates and almonds but was told that it was mixed into whatever it was that was served with this dish. For me, this was fine. I am not allergic, I just prefer to avoid them if I can; they (nuts) annoy me for some odd reason. Anyway, I actually forgot that the nuts (dates and almonds) were even supposed to be in this dish until just now as I am writing about it.  I didn't see any.  I didn't taste any.  Either they CAN omit them, or they are so finely ground into the sauce or seasoning that they are undetectable to a non-allergic throat. (Hence, if you have a nut allergy, you shouldn't risk it.)  This dish was quite savory.  Personally, I could have used a stronger (hotter) spice, but the dish was still very good as is. Cauliflowers were not too raw, nor were they over-cooked. They were of a perfect softly crunchy texture, if that makes sense.  


DESSERT:
They have only one vegan dessert at this time. It's called STRAWBERRY YUZU CHEESECAKE. It's a raw vegan cheesecake topped with a strawberry glaze. Typically, I shy away from raw cuisine, but after reading a Yelp-friend's raving review of this dessert, I gave it a shot and WOWZA! It is truly delicious!  It's sweet, a little tart, and a very good emulation of a baked cheesecake.  I was very impressed. (Side note: Yuzu sounded Japanese so out of curiosity I looked it up. It's a citrus fruit.)

They could use more vegan dessert options, but I'm happy with the vegan raw cheesecake for now.


Basically, I love this place.  Not only was the food pretty amazing (and filling), but the service - friendly, smiling, helpful employees, were all just icing on the proverbial cake, and really made this a 5-star experience.  Vegan items are clearly marked with a yellow circle with a line through it.  The decor is lovely; very  hippie-like.  And dude, there is even a little resting place for your yoga mats!  I especially loved the positive little messages written on their window panes.

Unfortunately for me, great for them, is that apparently everyone else must love it too.  By 11:30am, it was already packed.  Parking lot went \"from 0 to 100 real quick (real quick; real quick).\"  Also, I noticed that once it began to get busy, the employees started passing out numbers and assigning tables (instead of you picking your own).  The kitchen and service staff seemed well-managed; everything was moving so smoothly. 


Needless to say, I'll be back.  There is something about the name, Flower Child, that makes me happy.   Although I keep wanting to call it Sunflower, for some reason. Maybe because flowers grow in the sun? I don't know, but I do know that Flower Child has successfully mastered the art of executing flavorful, guilt-free food in a happy, healthy environment, and that is something that I can always support.  My name is Tigra, and I approve this message."}
{"text":"Came on the first day and my wife and I were so impressed. Nice employees, healthy & delicious, and at a good price! Will be frequent flyers for sure."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants. The Rebel is definitely one of my favorite things on the menu. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"WOW! I absolutely loved Flower Child! I was told by all of my friends for the longest time that I needed to try it, and I finally did and I'm so happy. Everything on the menu was extremely healthy and looked delicious. It took my forever to figure out what I wanted to order because I wanted everything!!! 

I finally picked and got the Vegan Ingredient Salad. It had cauliflower, corn, tomatoes, avocado, olives, and a vinaigrette. It was so fresh and delicious and I loved having the feeling that I was eating so healthy while eating something with so much flavor. I also ordered an iced tea and I picked the Passion Fruit Black Tea and I put some lemons in it. They only had natural sugar which was awesome because those ones are great for you over the unnatural ones. 

I really loved this place and the service was great as well. Every employee was super nice. The only downside was there was no WIFI, but it was ok because the food outweighed that negative! I would love to be able to relax in Flower Child though and get some work done!! 

Overall an amazing experience and I will 100% be going back to Flower Child!!"}
{"text":"Engineered fast casual. Good food but not cheap and portions are very measured. I ordered takeout. Soup cup was half full but they told me it's sold by weight. Tasty meal of a tofu wrap, spiced cauliflower, soup plus a vegan pudding. Total was almost $30 bucks so I won't be a regular here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  I have been twice.  1st time was the Strawberry Fields said with steak added, and this time was Mother Earth with steak added.  Absolutely delicious, and filling!  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Trendy, fresh & friendly, what more do you need! If you are not about the new self serve trend you are seeing more and more, than this place is not for you! For the others though, quick and healthy food is readily available for you! 

Don't be deceived by the long line should you drive by as people typically are just pondering on what amazing dish they should get. This place offers a variety of choices and the option to add protein to just about any dish! Friendly staff and quick service. The Vietnamese salad still remains my favorite with the Thai cashew bowl coming in second. However it is on the salty side. Clearly being here 2x within a week it's my go to spot. I'll be sure to update you on some other dishes my tastebuds enjoy and share them with all you foodies."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I would eat here everyday if I could. Everything is so fresh and clean. Everything is carefully thought out from the food to the decor. The whole experience was just incredible.

Pictured | skinny cobb + salmon | $15"}
{"text":"Always love the food here. Madras Curry chicken is my favorite. Hate arriving 5 min before they close BUT the crew here was friendly and didn't skip a beat. Luckily we weren't the last ones to order as people came in at 8:59p and they still took orders. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Finally a super fresh and healthy place in Las Vegas. Would definitely eat here everyday if I could. I tried the Mother Earth bowl and it was amazing - the flavors were incredible. Also great staff on board to help with recommendations. Such a cute vibe at the restaurant too - I'm in love!"}
{"text":"The prices aren't crazy and the food is fresh and delish. I love how cute the place is too, with good energy throughout. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for an awesome new vegan haunt, and this place answered my prayers! The atmosphere is boho, bright and open. We were greeted by two cheerful cashiers at the register. 

I got the Mother Earth Bowl. It was a bit pricey but it was incredibly filling I ended up skipping dinner. The bowl was colorful, fresh and delicious. The pesto was to die for. My friends got equally appetizing dishes. I was particularly intrigued by the Vegan Poke Bowl, which used marinated beets instead of tuna (LIKE, WHOA). 

Don't leave without trying a dessert! The vegan chocolate pudding was creamy and phenomenal, and the gluten-free brownie was perfecto. When I can make the room in my budget, I'd gladly return to this place. It's hard to find a fresh, vegan, delicious trifecta like this one!"}
{"text":"This is a big favorite of mine. Their mother earth bowl is phenomenal. I'm obsessed with their lemon tahini dressing too. I loved everything I've ever tried from this place. I've only had take out, but the service is always good. Sometimes a little slow, but there is usually a long line. Worth every cent and every minute."}
{"text":"They nailed it. Healthy food that tastes amazing. (Sorry, that's what I had come to equate healthy with. Boring. This joint is *not* bland.) The environment is light, airy and fun. Prepare yourself for the menu. There's quite a bit going on.

Here's what you need to know. 
You order up front when you walk in. It's ok to step to the side while you take it all in. Once you arrive at a decision look around and see if there's an open register. Someone will be smiling and that's the all clear. This is a lunch / late eve place.

You'll be given a number that you place on your table. Don't fret. No matter where you sit they'll find you. That includes the tables outside. Feel free to meander about, taking your time to grab silverware and drinks before selecting a table. (If you need to stop at the beautiful restrooms the servers will still find you.)

The menu is amazing. The concept is simple: Happy food makes happy people. Locally sourced, organic with plenty of vegetarian options. My gluten free friends will be happy: Tons of options! And (!) they will work with you to meet your dietary needs. That's how cool they are.

I've had the good fortune to eat with friends here and share. Yum, yum, yum! You simply must try the avocado hummus to start. When adding sides I love the sweet corn & quinoa. Yesterday I inhaled the Quinoa Protein Bowl. It's a warm dish. As with all of my visits I had no leftovers. (Shhh.) If you've got a sweet tooth beware. It can be dangerous :)

Take note: Food can be ordered for families. Also, food can readily be made to pick-up or to go.

If you follow them on Instagram there's a one time 10% discount. (Fist pump!) Kids are warmly welcome. The service is impeccable. Come once and you'll quickly return!"}
{"text":"Have you ever stumbled onto a restaurant that when you first see the menu there are so many incredible sounding options you can't decide? Well this is one of those. A cry diverse menu offering fresh local fare with creative flavors.  
I decided to get the plate simply choosing tiger first three items because the next visit I'll select the next three, etc. etc.
Fantastic flavor, nice portion size and a fun casual atmosphere. Only criticism was for a short while the line was long to place your order and it intruded on the space of some diners who already were eating in the dining area.  Family the rush subsided.
Securely will return. The chefs do a great job."}
{"text":"My soul went \"ahhhh\" when I walked in! The ambiance and energy is so peaceful yet lively. The staff was extremely friendly and unpretentious. I ordered the kale salad and daily juice and every morsel / sip was delicious! When I walked out of the restaurant, I noticed the \"yoga mat parking\" and it made me smile. Such a good way to end this lovely experience!"}
{"text":"OMG. I'm so glad they added this location since I used to live in Phoenix and I LOVE Flower Child !
I've been waiting this opening for months and I'm very impressed . I got a kale salad w grapefruit apple almond and red cabbage , yummy and fresh ! Also got my favorites of turmeric cauliflower and sweet corn quinoa . I was going to save some for my dad , a long time salmon fisherman in the Pacific Northwest (why I'm also so picky), but I couldn't stop! Melt in your mouth so perfectly prepared .  Service staff was amazing too. I love you Flower Child !!! I will be a regular xoxo"}
{"text":"Love the earth bowl, dog friendly on the porch. Great beer selection and kombucha on tap. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great local food and atmosphere! Local foods, plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. In house lemonades and teas with unique flavors. On our first visit I had the curry bowl, a little sweet but otherwise amazing. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Excited to see them open. Love the decor, love the menu, love everything (except would like a wider variety of beers).  Staff was on point for the opening and they were busy, but alll over it. Well run establishment. Kudos to the kitchen and front of the house. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has terrific food and good service that just happens to be mostly vegetarian.  I had a 3 veggie combo of sautéed spinach, smashed garlic potatoes and spicy Japanese eggplant. Sorry no photos because I devoured it all. And I like meat! The smells of the food cooking as you enter the door is enough to make you stay. If u want meat, chicken or salmon then u can add it. No worries.  Everything is very fresh! Eat tasty healthy food here!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at for lunch! The portions are just right, the food taste fresh every time, and best of all its healthy! Their service is great as well. Staff is always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Flower child is one of those restaurants that just has a no fail business model.... All fresh organic type veggies... Fairly simple food... Fast casual atmosphere. It all comes together to be a winning restaurant. The only bad part of this place is the price... Most everything is fairly pricy, especially considering the restaurant is 'fast casual.' anyway, I had one of the wraps with chicken and hummus and it was damn tasty with a nice freshness to it. It also was big enough for me to take half home. Despite the price, I would come back. 

Ps don't waste your time with desserts here...the couple I tried tasted way too 'healthy'... Maybe not worth the calories."}
{"text":"The food is really great. The only negative is that it is probably the loudest restaurant I have ever been too. I usually just do take out."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying this place. I love that it's super healthy and the interior is super modern and cute.

This time I got the Thai chicken curry soup and it was delicious!!! Then I got the mushroom pho bowl and it was super disappointing. My gf got the mushroom pho bowl and we both agreed. I understand that it's not authentic but the broth was so bland n there was absolutely no taste to it.. so needless to say was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't get the fascination with this place. Very expensive for what you get and their food (most of which is salads) seem very common and under-portioned. 

Salads at Wildflower, Corner Bakery Cafe, NCounter, are better and cost less."}
{"text":"Great healthy food highly recommend there salmon dish is cocked perfect
A bit pricey and medium size courses"}
{"text":"Great food! Also I wanted to leave this review because today, in spite of their CRAZY busy lunch rush, one of their managers went above and beyond to go get creamer for me at the grocery store when they ran out. Totally not necessary but he insisted. Also, I am in the restaurant industry and watched him expedite the line to get food orders up and out like no other! A true professional who has clearly had great training from Fox and enjoys what he does. Didn't go unnoticed. I hope Flower Child/Fox Concepts realizes what a great manager they have there!"}
{"text":"So I consider myself a flower child growing up in the generation that I did and have been looking forward to stopping in here for a bite. We had a lovely dinner here on Saturday evening. 

Ordering is a breeze, you just walk up to the counter and let them know what you want, grab your number and find a place to sit down. When your dish is ready, a server will bring it out to you. Staff was not overly friendly but you don't have a lot of interaction with them except when you order. I did speak with a staff member while pouring my tea, and she was super outgoing and bubbly. She was educated and helpful with the tea selection. 

The dining area is large and you can choose to chow down inside or opt for the patio dining which is what we chose. This place is so bright and airy. Great use of color through out the interior along with the groovy patio. You can't help smiling as you enjoy the good vibes emanating from this cafe'.

This cafe is primarily vegan but you have the ability to add protein to any meal. I chose the Strawberry Fields salad and added all natural chicken. The salad included organic strawberries, wild arugula, shaved fennel, toasted oats, dried mulberry, goat cheese, and the most delicious chia seed vinaigrette. It was a healthy choice for dinner and I also tried their Japanese mango sencha green tea. 
My daughter tried the Flying Avocado wrap featuring smoked turkey, gouda, romaine, tomato and avocado hummus. We were both pleased with our meals. Everything tasted fresh and the produce was crisp. The avocado hummus was so tasty! The menu has such variety. They have salads, wraps, bowls and plates. For the kids, they have some healthy choices for them which you don't see often enough at restaurants. They also serve organic wine and some Nevada brewed beer as well. 

I will definitely return here often so I can try more dishes from the menu. In addition, you can order food to go and they are offering e-bites!"}
{"text":"Well...I came here for lunch and dinner 3 consecutive times...I can tell you that I was satisfied. I don't think their pricing is bad at all compare to Panacea. It's healthy and they serve wine which is a plus! Haha I tried ordering different items at each time I've been here to see if they will keep up with the expectations. So far, everything I've ordered was great! You don't often find a healthy organic food with lots of flavor. This place is busy but you don't wait too long for your food to be served at your table. Will definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for weekend brunch! It's one of my families favorite spots. I get the protein scramble every time. It tastes amazing and I feel good about having it. They put some sort of honey mustard on it that is to die for. They also have a great selection of iced teas to chose from. The decor is super cute and fits with the hippie chic vibe they have going on there. If you're looking for a quick and healthy meal this is the place"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Have you had the spicy sweet potatoes? So good! Great place to grab a healthy meal. It is on the pricey side for the portion sizes especially. I really enjoy eating on their patio! Overall good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, fun atmosphere, and clean!! I highly recommend this restaurant. Kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"This establishment makes more than enough money to afford cups/lids that do not leak. This is an ongoing issue that is not being addressed."}
{"text":"The daily soup was too salty, but the management was not.
A+ for listening to feedback and handling it exceptionally well."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Flower Child.  It's always my \"go to\" place whenever I meet a girlfriend or my husband and I want a healthy meal.  The service is always great.  The manager her name was Kim, personally made her rounds and asked us all how we were enjoying our meal!  The severs always have a smile on their faces and I always feel welcome.   My favorite dish is the curry.  You can't go wrong with any meal.  I recommend Flower Child if you're  looking for a healthy meal and outstanding service."}
{"text":"I know everyone is raving about this place. It's one of those crunchy granola, hipster, millenial place to have some avocado toast in a hippy setting. 

I didn't dislike it. But I can't say that I absolutely loved it either. I had the rice bowl and it was good and added steak. It wasn't bad. I just think for the price there's a lot of other places and things I'd rather eat. My daughters wanted to try it so we went. 

One daughter had the skinny cob and loved it. My other daughter has the strawberry fields salad and liked it but the said she preferred cafe Zuppas salad...and my other daughter and I thought she was nuts. This was way more flavorful and who wants to repeat their order 50 times..this is better...order take a number--take it to the table and they Bring it there. 

I would eat there again. Not sure if it's my first choice but I wouldn't be opposed to it."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Arcadia! Their salads are delicious! Parking is difficult at lunch, but otherwise this is an amazing place. Order their lemonade! Worth every penn."}
{"text":"Salmon & asparagus were delicious and fresh. Very healthy & filling but still light. The quinoa is my favorite, it's heaven. We had 4 in our party and we tried almost all of the small plates, everything  was tasty."}
{"text":"The salad I had was delicious but pricey. Love the atmosphere and all the options they offer."}
{"text":"wow my bf and i had dinner here one night on our arizona vacation and it was the best meal of the trip! love the gender neutral green themed bathroom. i got the thai cashew quinoa bowl it was delicious! if i end up in arizona again i will return. i love this new american food i am blessed by great tasting vegan and gluten free options thank you flower child for nourishing me"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I go to Flower Child practically across the street from where I work at Paypal, and this time was no different, but this time, the crowd was thinner so I sat in instead of taking it back to work with me.  The environment was nice, like I would expect, happy people serving and helping at every step, Kelsey stood out in the dining area delivering food, clearing tables quickly and dishing out smiles and compliments as she went.  All in all, an excellent dining experience and one to be repeated again and again. This time I had the Mushroom Pho, but usually get their Forbidden Rice which is to die for, and their Indian Spiced Cauliflower is amazing."}
{"text":"I am a fox restaurant food junky! Every time I go to flower child (or any fox restaurant) I am never disappointed. I always get the salmon and spinach, or the steak and mashed potatoes; both are delicious, full of flavor, and don't make me feel bad after eating! Love it!"}
{"text":"Flower Child is the new hot restaurant in our area. We have tried it a few times (including opening week) and each experience has been fantastic. It's a fast casual concept, so you seat yourself and get your own drinks, but food arrives to your table quickly. 

The decor- bright and colorful. Great indoor and outdoor spaces, with comfortable seating. 

The staff- really friendly and always greets you with a smile. They have been able to describe menu items and make suggestions based on our likes. 

The food- so awesome. We have tried several items and each has been worth returning for. Some of our favorites are the thai cashew bowl with salmon, the avocado hummus, and the mac and cheese. 

This is one of our new favorite spots!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressive vegetarian food and drink.  Fast but casual gourmet veggies prepared in a creative manner.  Not a sit down type place until you place your order upon entry.  The bowls are gr8 and the salads are healthy and tasty.  Avocado toast also yummy.  A little loud but a delicious addition
to the culinary scene.  Friendly service and good people watching.  Love the ice teas."}
{"text":"Based on my takeout experience, Flower Child is a dressed down version of True Food Kitchen, with some similar menu options. I like it. We tried a kale salad, the edamame hummus with veggies, and a Mother Earth bowl. All were very fresh, tasty, and wholesome. The Mother Earth bowl was very similar to the ancient grains bowl at True Food Kitchen, where the biggest different I saw was the tofu, which was sliced in smaller, more manageable pieces at Flower Child compared to TFK. Overall, it's a great pick for takeout, if you're looking for something that tastes good while being reasonably good for your body."}
{"text":"This was a very nice time.
I enjoyed the service and the staff 
Was amazing.
I went late afternoon which was nice, cause it was quite and a quit warm environment. I'd recommend this place to all my friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't really like the way they do the chicken. But the chopped vegetable salad is amazing just as is. Plus they have really good lemonades."}
{"text":"I love Flower Child! I don't think I have eaten better Brussel Sprouts in my life!!! If you love these green things then try them from here!!! The biggest disappointment is the size of their portions. It is so freakin healthy that you will be hungry in 2 hours. 

Vegan hash is also amazing!! Put the Brussel Sprouts on top! Yes. I can't stop talking about the Brussel Sprouts. So try them!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin....I've gone here so many times, but based on my last meal here tonight, I won't ever be back. The mashed potatoes were tasty....all three bites that were in my container. I didn't really think the portion size could be scaled back, but apparently the tiny containers are no longer even close to being full.  The avocado hummus was THE WORST I've ever had here! Oily and tasteless. Guess the inflated prices aren't enough for the owners??? Let's cut corners even more....must be the mantra during their daily meetings....I would not recommend this place to anyone after this. I am beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"We had the Flying Avocado, Rebel, and the rose petal lemonade.  The Flying Avocado was fresh but it did not have much flavor. The Rebel was salty, and was not crazy about the flavor.  When eating the wrap for some reason while eating it with all the stems from the arugula, I felt like I was going to choke on it. Not much meat inside really. The rose petal lemonade was just okay, I could taste more of the rose petal than the lemonade.  Place cute inside, although very noisy. Eat outside or in other room if you do not like it noisy.  A little pricey about $35."}
{"text":"My first time at Flower Child and I am really impressed by the taste, freshness and originality of the food items.  The GM, Blake,  was very informative in explaining the fresh ingredients and herbs used.  The hummus was very good as was the salad with salmon.  I wolves back very soon to savor more of the delicious offerings.  Thanks to Blake for your friendly approach to customers."}
{"text":"Flower Child is really a great restaurant. They have a good selection of healthy food. Their service is great and the servers are friendly.

My only complaint is that their food selections are on the expensive side. I will be a regular customer and hope they eventually lower their prices."}
{"text":"3rd time at this restaurant. Service is great, food is wonderful, however this is my first time ordering take out. Very unpleased with the night and day portion along with consistency of what the bowl contains. About 30% less of a portion and 70% less of the veggies that comes along with the bowl from what I'm used to while dining in. Needles to say, I won't get take out again, will visit when time permits to dine in. Hope they haven't changed their portions for what they charge."}
{"text":"Overall our dishes lacked flavor. I like that it's healthy but healthy can still be flavorful. The drink options are fun, I'd return simply for the different lemonades and teas. 

The restaurant was dirty, lots of garbage on the ground and dishes on tables. The staff might as well have come straight out of Mean Girls."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere - had the spicy eggplant, great flavor without too much spice - Also had the corn with quinoa and yogurt, really good - I've sent the menu to all my friends - excellent place for anyone who likes to eat healthy !!"}
{"text":"I guess at successful restaurants in Arcadia you don't have to provide any level of customer service. It's fine to have a busy restaurant but if the food is going to take 40-60 minutes longer to get out of the kitchen than normal you tell people before they order. You don't keep them trapped in your restaurant after they have paid for food waiting. I will give it to the kitchen staff, it looks like most of them where fighting nobly to get through orders but you can only do so much when the proper systems are not there to set you up for success. I also appreciated the decaf ice tea! The food was decent but the smug child posing behind the counter as an adult needs to learn how to treat people. Seriously working behind the counter at a casual dining establishment gives you no high ground to look down on people from, it's honest work, I've done it myself but I never forgot that I was in CUSTOMER service. I can't wait to try the location in central, it's soooo close to my house I don't think I will be able to resist trying it!!!!  Also I have to throw a shout out to the twenties something women who pretty much ran around crazy doing everything for everyone, she has a tattoo on her right arm, she knows who she is!!! Keep kicking ass.

Edit: the manager was very quick to respond to my review and it gives me hope that they will do better in the future! Also go Hopi hawks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service is good, it's pricey but I guess it's healthy and healthy isn't cheap! Haha. Enjoy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for a quick and healthy bite!! Avocado toast is always delicious and the sides are fantastic! Quinoa corn, gluten free mac & cheese, and smashed organic potatoes are hands down my favs!"}
{"text":"Who in their right mind would ever give Flower Child less than 5 stars? I love love love this place!! I just wish there was one closer to me down in Chandler...or maybe it's good that there's not because my whole paycheck would be blown, ha!

Every time I have come here I have never been disappointed with the food that I have gotten. My go-to is the mother earth bowl as it's chock full of goodies...and coupled with their organic marinated tofu, it's a meal from the Gods! 

Their vegan chocolate pudding is the bomb as well...I constantly tell myself that it's fat free, calorie free, and carbohydrate free and that I'll actually lose weight from eating it. I wish it worked that way haha. 

I love their drink station too...it's full of tasty made-from-scratch iced teas and lemonades and they're always so refreshing! it's a must-do when you're dining here."}
{"text":"Please please please put one of these in Chandler!!!

The mother earth bowl with tofu is a must have! It's got a little bit of everything including avocado, quinoa, greens (arugula) and sweet potatoes. All of the ingredients pair very well and it's freakin' delicious! I also tried the vegan ingredient salad which was also really good! Definitely give this place a try if you're in the mood for healthy food and a really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super hip restaurant in Pheonix. I got the forbidden rice with chicken. Delicious. However, I would try something else in the future. I'm from LA, which has some of the best Asian foods, this was an okay take on Asian food.

My friend had the beef wrap, and that was great!

Be aware, the prices are a bit high for what you get, but it is healthy. 

If I had more money, I would have gotten their lemonade. They have some awesome flavors. 

Would I come again? Yes
Would I bring a friend? Yes"}
{"text":"Before eating here I read several reviews. I thought I was prepared for the sticker shock, but nope. The food is fresh and tasty, but the only way you can eat here for less than $15 per person is to not add any protein, drinks, or desserts to your meal. And given the portion size (about which I had been warned), you might leave still feeling hungry--or perhaps not completely satisfied. 

As far as the food, the Mother Earth with salmon added and the Late Riser are both good choices. The Late Riser is filling enough for lunch, but might not be enough food for dinner. The plus is that it's great without adding any additional protein, but I'm guessing it would be good with chicken. The flavors of the Mother Earth paired well, but even with the salmon, I found myself eating every last bite and wondering if I still needed to order something else.

I love the concept and the atmosphere of this place, but just not enough to take the hit to my bank account very often."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. What a difference this plaza has made in the past couple years. Loved the lemonade and tea bar. I got the Thai cashew bowl and man was it good! Has so much flavor."}
{"text":"Love it. Been to the new Santa Monica location twice in the past week. Delicious food, helpful, smiling servers, fantastic prices! I just wish we knew the nutritional info like calorie count. But the food is amazing. The restaurant is comfortable to sit and relax in. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! The staff was great, the food was delicious and the atmosphere felt fresh and invigorating."}
{"text":"Great healthy restaurant in Scottsdale Arizona please come to California Walnut Creek preferably."}
{"text":"A bit spendy for the portion sizes - $19 lunch with a drink. The late riser bowl had a good flavor. I added shredded chicken and for $5.. for 2-3 oz of chicken that seemed a little tight. Service was good and staff was friendly. I'll try it again and do a salad or plate to give them a second shot."}
{"text":"I am in town for a business trip & decided to try this place - SOOO glad I did. The food was nothing short of amazing & I am soooo excited that there is one only a couple hours from me at home (in Santa Monica, CA)!

I started with the veggie salad but substituted the edamame with red bell pepper & the dressing with the lemon avocado dressing & I LOVED it (trying to reduce soy intake). 

Don't judge me, but because everything sounded so good, I also got a 3 option plate plus a protein: red chili sweet potatoes, Indian spiced cauliflower, green beans & snap peas, & chicken as my protein choice. Everything tasted incredible!

Special shout out & thanks to Courtney, who took my order. She was super patient while I figured out what to eat (so many great options), answered my millions of questions (food restrictions/ingredients), & was just all around so sweet (also told me about the CA location)!

Can't wait to visit again with my family!"}
{"text":"Lovely place with a wonderful menu. Food came out fast both times I tried it. I had a salad the first time and a bowl the second time. Both were tasty. I am a person who thinks typical \"American\" portions are unnecessarily large and wasteful. But all of the people who say they left hungry after eating here were not kidding. I think most people would need to either get 2 items or add a protein to their salad or bowl to feel satisfied. At that point, you are looking at $20, and sorry Flower Child, there are so many wonderful restaurants in Phoenix where I would rather go and get a lovely sit-down meal for that $20."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Flower Child so when I heard that  this location was opening, I was so excited.  Today was the grand opening day and they were giving out free samples of Kombucha and flower bundles for the ladies. 

The food is amazing. I think it's slightly better than their 90th street location. The eggplant was seasoned better. The strawberry fields salad had organic strawberries which were so fresh and sweet. Avocado hummus was spot on with toasted pumpkin seeds adding nice crunch. 

Staff were excellent. They seemed to have everything working perfectly. Although the line was out the door, they had it moving and once seated, food came out pretty quickly. They had plenty of seats inside and out (patio) although most people chose to sit inside due to the warm weather. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. They offer non-gmo and sustainable food choices. I had tried many things on their menu and all were equally yummy. The best part is that you can combine your favorite ingredients and make your personal meal. The possible combinations are endless."}
{"text":"I drove an hour to take my wife here for her birthday yesterday. First time for both of us. We would have driven another hour to go to this place. WOW! best food and phenomenal service. I had a bowl and added steak and my wife a salad with chicken. Best and juiciest grass fed steak ever. Same with the chicken. Side of the best smashed potatoes ever! We had to get some gluten free deserts on our way out, delicious.  We were so impressed that we came back today and picked up a family meal for our drive home. I wish we had one in queen creek so we could eat here daily. For now we will make the trek at least once a month for date night. Thanks KC, your the best! Love! Love! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious organic food, this is the place to go.  I went their during a busy Friday lunch rush and it was still a great experience.  I had the Flying Avocado wrap which was delicious. My wife had the Forbidden Rice which was equally amazing.  I kinda loved that they had tea and lemonade to drink and NO soda.  They also carry a local brew, today's pick was Four Peaks White Ale.  There were many great choices on the menu, even a mix and match section.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dietary restrictions...or anyone who loves great food!  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. consistently tastes delicious, the most quality ingredients,  warm and friendly staff. Clean. Great atmosphere. I recommend the salmon, GF Mac cheese and the butternut squash."}
{"text":"Local produce, friendly staff, awesome food. The prices are reasonable, the menu changes with the season. I recently had the Summer Salad, so good."}
{"text":"I saw this place and figured I'd give it a try. I went to pick up an order for lunch and bring it to work. It was really busy at lunch time, but the service was amazing. A lot of times new restaurants when they first open aren't as organized, but this place really surprised me. I got the avocado wrap and a drink. There were a lot of teas and lemonades to choose from that they make, and it was delicious. The wrap was super yummy as well. I am definitely going to have to make this place one of my go to spots for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Great ambience, wine, desserts, and kombucha. Best salad I've ever had. I've been thrice and they've failed to disappoint."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, customer service is very important no matter how good or bad your food is and their customer service is AMAZING! I had a bit of an issue with my food and kindly called to see what could be done and the manager delivered a new plate for me. Very impressed and will go back time and time again!"}
{"text":"We were in town from Dallas and wanted to find a quick place with fun healthy food. This place has organic food, Tastes great, decent prices, and a fun ambiance. I got the Ancient grains bowl which was great and my wife got the Greens salad which was also great"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Everyone I went with has vegetarian items, but WOW. I love their lentils, macaroni tastes super buttery and delicious! My only complaint is that my potion of lentils is somewhat small for being $4, especially because lentils are so cheap! Anyway, great place. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"It is difficult for me to rate Flower Child on the 5 star scale.  I've eaten there about 5 times. Some observations: 

1. You can eat there for a decent price IF you are careful.  Drinks and desert add significantly to to bill. Note prices carefully 

2.  This place suffers a bit from being overly hip at times - all the cookies are gluten free, for example.  Their name, a throwback to spoiled suburbanite college students in 1967, seems appropriate.   

3.  Why no unflavored black or green iced tea?  Flavored teas make me order water only.  Again, trying too hard.  

4. I once got a very sandy salad.  Sure things like this happen now and then.  What I don't like is when the server becomes defensive and offers excuses when I politely told her about the sand.  Yes, organic lettuce might be more sandy, and, yes, if you know that then wash it more carefully.  

With places like Mad Greens and Grabba Green in the area serving great salads at lower prices, Flower Child has its work cut out for it.  

Bottom line:  overpriced and perhaps missing attention to details.  You can get better for less money and also drink unflavored tea.  Probably not meeting the overall quality you'd want at this price point."}
{"text":"Just overall amazing food and friendly staff. Everything they make is a winner. You can never go wrong with this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Been curious to try this since it opened but just had a chance to have lunch today. I enjoyed my Thai Cashew Red Quinoa w/ Salmon. It was delish! Quinoa was a bit overcooked but still tasty. My husband tried the Forbidden Rice w/ Salmon and our daughter can't keep her hands off it. They both love it. Our daughter ordered the Wild Mushroom Pho w/ Chicken & put the condiments & fresh bean sprouts, basil & lemon that gave the yummy flavor. My husband commented that the broth tasted clean & fresh. Will definitely be back again. Found our favorite healthy-go to restaurant. Their varieties of free refill lemonades & ice teas are also amazing.  Can't wait to try their other entrees & salads."}
{"text":"The cashier was very nice and friendly. I chose the forbidden rice bowl with chicken. It was OK.my friend and I decided the music was way too loud inside so we went outside for a more quiet atmosphere-didn't happen speakers were blaring right down on all the tables outside as well. We tolerated it and then I went to the bathroom oh my goodness the music was the loudest in there LOL it was ridiculous! 
We watched a young waitress struggle with the outside heaters for a while and then give up. She was never able to get them going, but left the gas on the one right next to us. My friend ended up walking over and turning the knob from \"ignite\" to \"off\" as the gas smell was overwhelming.  The waitress  should have sought help from the Manager to complete the task!!!! 
The \"shared\" bathrooms: I do not know one woman on this planet that wants to share a restaurant bathroom with a man.  Men tend to splash and dribble pee all over and women just simply don't want to sit or walk in it!  We also don't want to deal with toilet seats left up! There is a savvy \"toeopener\" handle on the bottom of the door. You are supposed to open the door with your foot so that you don't have to touch the door at all when you are leaving the bathroom after you have washed your hands. This would be great, except for the fact that you have to unlock the bathroom door with your hand to get out!  
Flower child please turn the music down, and simply put a \"LADIES\" sign on one bathroom and a \"MENS\" sign on the other bathroom. It's hard to believe these days, that you would need instruction to do this which the majority prefers."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a healthy lunch. Lots of gluten-free, dairy-free & vegan dishes available alongside traditional fare. The vegan, gluten-free Caesar is tangy & delicious. I add chicken for some protein. I only wish they had some gluten-free croutons to make this dish perfect. All of their desserts are gf and delish, especially the brownie! Expect a long line out the door during lunch hour. I wish they also had some gf bread here as a side. I would give 5 stars but I do get a little tired of their menu & wish they'd offer some seasonal dishes to mix things up a bit. Also, it's a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Great flavors! I had the Mother Earth bowl with tofu. Felt great after. They also carry Yerba Mate. Please come to Utah!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Great choices, add on proteins, teas and lemonade, no soda, why, cuz it's healthy food here. Servers super friendly, welcoming, appreciative. Tips are odd here as it's set up like a wildflower, but it's so far from that for service, food choices and quality, and atmosphere. Wish they had more locations around the valley! Well done on this concept."}
{"text":"Got Forbidden Rice, with salmon, and added sides of spinach and eggplant. Everything delicious! Also got the chicken curry soup, perfect size, tasted so good! Bill was $35, but it was all delicious."}
{"text":"The drinks. Teas and lemonades. Why hasn't someone thought of this before? I mixed them... We were all mixing them. It was like a tea, fruit, cucumber, lemonade mixing orgy. 

My friend said I shouldn't miss the sweet potatoes. I ordered them and the employee swooned for me. Good sign. They were, in fact, delicious alongside my grilled asparagus and steamed broccoli which I topped with salmon for $16 and felt like a fitness culinary champ. \"Go healthy, tasty food!\" \"Go me!\"

One woman asked my other friend which salad she had. I don't remember which it was, but both of them loved it. I was drooling at all the salads. 

People were lined up out the door - a testament to how badly this place is needed east of the 101. Thanks FRC real estate team for remembering us. Please bring more options."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new spot! Have been wanting to since we saw it under construction. Love having clean eating choices! The decor is adorable and the atmosphere is fresh and bright. The line was long to order but moved quickly.
We were able to sit outside on the cute patio and enjoy a beautiful Saturday! Unfortunately my husband ordered a dish with steak and after waiting quite awhile we asked. It seems they had run behind on steak and no one told us that it was taking extra long (most of us were almost finished!) The manager (I think, but sadly I don't know his name) came over and apologized profusely for the error. Not only did he refund the item from our check, he also brought us some lemon cake muffins with a smile! Can't beat that kind of customer service. The food was absolutely delicious! Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this location! My family dines here regularly, always satisfied. Chicken curry, flying avocado and all salads are my favorite. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Very noisey. Serve yourself kinda place.  Always a line."}
{"text":"Road trips can be unhealthy, so my boyfriend and I were looking for something healthy and decently quick. We stumbled upon flower child and it was exactly what we needed! Delicious food, affordable prices, and adorable branding!! I loved the white marble tables with gold edges. They've got the details down that make a place exceptional. Now they just need to make their way to Chicago!"}
{"text":"Very tasty fare.I like their options to add proteins, and you get a deal if you get more sides. Great Atmosphere-nice and airy and bright. Really happy to see restaurants that offer gluten-free options :-)"}
{"text":"I don't usually write a restaurant review until I've visited a place at least twice.  I can't remember how many times I've been to Flower Child, it might be 7-8, but I love this place!

Not just because it is only a block away from my house, although that's nice; not just because I'm a vegetarian and they have so many good options on the menu, but that does make me happy; not just because they do their best to source locally, etc., even though I support that -- and not just because the atmosphere is nice, which it surely is.

But -- I like Flower Child for all of the above.  You can get in and out quickly if you want, you can take your time.  I have liked every single menu item I've experienced there, and that'd be quite a list if I could even remember them all at this point.

Summation:  it's all good if this is your kind of thing and if this isn't your kind of thing, this place just might make a convert of you."}
{"text":"I got a few things to go. The food was pretty good but expensive for small portions. I know this is a big corporate restaurant group cashing in on the \"healthy\" eating trend so not sure they care as much about health as their concept would lead you to believe but they have an amazing opportunity to try and do some genuinely good things for the planet. How about starting by changing the plastic takeout containers? Not only is plastic such wasteful landfill but it's really bad for our bodies. Even paper boxes would be so much better. Why put a tiny piece of avocado toast in a plastic box that someone is going to immediately throw away? How about leading by example and not just pretending to be a healthy place??"}
{"text":"We love love love this place! Amazing food, super reasonable, and hip! Great spot for vegan/veggo's with tons of fun, interesting, creative options! We would eat here every day if we lives in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options with amazingly friendly staff. They were so helpful with my allergies. I think I have a new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"I very rarely rave about restaurants after eating at them. This one is an exception. I absolutely love the concept of fresh local \"fast food.\" I felt no guilt as I tried the avacado hummus (yum!) and the sesame sweet potatos. The service was excellent, and I keep telling every health consious person I know that this is a must-try restaurant in the Valley."}
{"text":"I stopped in on their opening day after receiving an email from Flower Child. It is a cute addition to that corner of Desert Ridge and it was still a bustling lunch crowd at 2:30.  Everyone was very friendly, although I did not see any signs of the giveaways they had mentioned in the email- macaroons, flowers, kombucha tastings....not while I was there. I got my order to go. They have a limited space for to go orders- only two chairs for people waiting. Even though it was busy, my order was ready in about 10 minutes. I still think their prices are a little high but unfortunately I love their lemonades and iced teas and their food choices are healthy and fresh. They offer desserts but I have not tried them yet."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. It is a busy loud popular place but we managed to arrive before the lunch rush. Two of us ordered the Thai cashew quinoa with tofu and one had the flying avocado wrap and we all had lemonades. After ordering at the counter we found a seat and waited for our $50 lunch. They have plenty of employees running around clearing tables etc. and they have very nice lemonade and iced tea options.  We were served in a decent amount of time and none of us could finish our meals. However, no one loved their meal either. The taste was good but not amazing. Overall, I wish their prices were lower and that the restaurant was not so loud."}
{"text":"Beautiful & trendy new hangout spot in Summerlin. Equal indoor & outdoor seating with a really colorful happy vibe to it. My girlfriend & I loved it & will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'm super thrilled that Flower Child finally has a location close to my job.  Kudos to this company for supporting local growers to provide them with super fresh, and delicious veggies. I did take out today, and their Mix & Match options were amazing. I had the red chili glazed sweet potato: yum, Indian spiced cauliflower: wow, steamed broccoli with parmesan cheese: delicious (although, someone forgot to sprinkle on the Parmesan cheese ). The avocado hummus with sweet corn, radish, clementine, and pumpkin seed is a must order item. Visually beautiful, as it is extremely refreshing to the taste. I can't wait to dine at this place on my day off. Until then, stay awesome ."}
{"text":"I think the food is fantastic, clean, staff is friendly,  a  great place for lunch. Highly recommend to at least give it a try, you will become a regular."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice clean place. It can be a bit pricy but I'm always happy with the food!"}
{"text":"So fresh and delicious! You can taste the fresh and organic ingredients... I had the mother child bowl! A+"}
{"text":"Best quick vegetable ever. Don't I look happy?  Everything is yummy.  EVERYTHING!

You order at the counter and the staff was friendly and explained everything. It was so great to create my perfect paleo meal. Protein and veggies!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Another Fox home run.  Great place for a quick, light, healthy meal!!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I thought the prices were a little high, but when I tasted the quality of the food I knew it was all worth it.   Every time I'm there it seems the staff are overwhelmed and don't give you that extra attention that we all love, but the food is still worth it.  Maybe I'll do carryout next time."}
{"text":"My favorite!! Everything I've ever had is just wonderful and so fresh. Some of my favorites- grains and greens salad, flying avocado wrap, Mother Earth bowl (add salmon for protein). Good portions. Love their fresh, flavored lemonades at the beverage station that you can mix and together. Fruit infused water is a nice touch. 

Tends to get busy for lunch but they do a great job of organizing the crowds and tables. 

Prices aren't cheap but quality of food is so worth it. I would come here every day if I court afford it!"}
{"text":"Huge Flower Child fan! This location is in a shopping plaza with some great stores. It's across the street from Shea Honor Health, which must be super nice and convenient for hospital employees, patients and visitors. 

Always great service. It gets pretty busy during lunchtime so expect a line. They do a great job of managing and seating customers in line. Also very considerate that they offer fruit infused water for customers. Dine in and enjoy their casual dining or call ahead for take out and skip to their special takeout-only line. 

I've been here countless times and the food is so fresh and yummy. Everything I've ever had is always quite delicious. Be sure to try their house lemonades - you can mix them and they also have crushed ice which earns bonus points in my book.

Some of favorites include the grains and greens salad, Mother Earth bowl, kale salad, and their soups are phenomenal --especially the Moroccan chickpea soup - my God it's good! 

I am super bummed they removed my very favorite grains and greens salad from the menu and I hope they decide to bring it back soon because it was soooo good! To management: please please please considering putting it back on the menu!"}
{"text":"I am super excited to have this flower child close to home! The decor is so cheery and the landscaping is perfectly manicured. Food is healthy and delicious! Many options for those who are vegan and vegetarian as well! I always root for Mr. Sam Fox and his hospitality driven team! Thank you for a great lunch! And thank you Kent for stopping by to say hello! Xoxo best wishes!"}
{"text":"This place is going to be my new spot! At least until I go through the menu and try everything, but that may take a while ha 
Everything is good and good for you - this is a dining sanctuary for Vegans and those who suffer with gluten allergies. I love the happy, healthy, hippie vibe and the fact they have avocado for days. Clean eating and they serve both kambucha and beer on tap...life's all about balance after all."}
{"text":"Healthy Healthy Healthy. Don't expect burgers, pizza and soda here. They are taken by wraps, salads, home made lemonade and pho.

Not easy to find if you are not looking for the place. It is tucked behind Schmidt Jewelers on the Northeast corner of 44rh St and Camelback. 

The decor is everything you would expect from a Sam Fox Restaurant,  very nice and inviting. 

I tried The Rebel Wrap - Steak and the home made lemonade which both were very good. You order at the counter, a person assigns you a table and they bring the food to your table. The drinks are all in dispensers so you help yourself. 

Would recommend this place as a good place for lunch more so than dinner. 

Food was good, not real large portions but enough to fill you up.

Would recommend trying this place and look forward to coming back to try another dish"}
{"text":"The food is good and healthy very small portions. Service is excellent. Parking is a challenge but little walk helps. Avoid lines after 11.15 am."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot while visiting Scottsdale. Wish this place existed in Chicago. It is the ideal hybrid of healthy, while being fast. Menu is extensive and truly something for everyone, especially the GF, Vegan loving crowd. I opted to go with the avocado toast, a delicious and heathy snack. Will definitely be going back for the wraps and juices."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Phoenix. I sure wish they would open one in Ahwatukee area. Some of the best vegan bowls out there."}
{"text":"I still love coming to flower child but have been unimpressed with their food lately. I am especially sad that they got rid of the chicken in the flyin avocado. Plea"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get..Pita Jungle a way better deal and way larger portions..gluten free mac n cheese is terrific but a small portion."}
{"text":"I have not had anything I didn't love here! I especially love the Thai Cashew Quinoa. The gluten free baked goods are amazing, as are the assortment of teas and lemonades. The ambiance is very comfortable and hip at the same time, with nice outdoor seating. The only thing that keeps me away from eating here all the time is the price. For such a casual place, I feel like $20 for lunch for one person is too pricey (for a dish with protein and a drink). Consequently, this is also why I rated it 4 and not 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to-spot for a quick meal that's healthy and not fast food. The food is fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is fun. I love the little hydration station!"}
{"text":"No no no. I came here looking for healthy food. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl with steak and it was SO salty. Like unbearably salty. And it was SO expensive. The steak was served cold and tasted gritty and tough. I hardly ever just leave food uneaten because I hate wasting food but this was unbearable. I do not recommend if you're sensitive to salt because you will not like this place."}
