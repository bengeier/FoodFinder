{"text":"Great coffee and also sells jars of ready to make soup (just put ingredients in a large pot and voila).  Good pastries also.  Nice little find!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for Milano's soft opening and loved the cappuccino (properly proportioned!!!) Chocolate croissant is a dream!! Staff are friendly and knowledgeable coffee lovers. The interiors are clean, bright and flooded with natural light - love the brick and wood slats  What I found the most interesting are the many espresso blends \"on tap\" looking forward to trying them all!!!"}
{"text":"My go to and absolute favourite coffee. I frequent this location in Toronto and their many other locations whenever I'm in Vancouver. And when I'm not out, it's milano at home. Nothing comes close. Hands down best coffee. The owner in Toronto is also an awesome guy. Always friendly and makes the effort to know your name and order. Highly recommended. Milano roasted for the win."}
{"text":"Discovered this fabulous place on my walk to work. I had an Americano that made me feel relaxed and invigorated. I felt so good I had to stop by on the way back for a pick me upper.  A must try!"}
{"text":"The service and quality of the coffee is amazing. It's such a pleasure going into this place. Their cappuccino is delicious - it's classic with the foam (unlike newer spots that don't include the foam). The snacks are tasty without being overly sweet."}
{"text":"Located in Entertainment District, Milano Espresso Bar hails from Vancouver, processing west coast heart with Italian soul. This is not your familiar coffee chain or your hip wannabe coffee joint, we were educated in the art of enjoying coffee. Cafe Milano designs the entire coffee experience from the roasting of beans to the selection of filtering paper. The coffee bean was roasted until it is completely dehydrated where the bean is at its most intense concentration. My friend and I ordered the Bourbon and Turk Island coffee. While I am not a coffee aficionado, it was a great experience nonetheless. I can feel the barista's enthusiasm for his art."}
{"text":"Very nice space with plenty of light. Easy to work from here for an hour or two or just stop in for a casual drink with a friend. Not pretentious (which many of the newer places can be), friendly and knowledgeable staff, good selection of beans/pastries, and good coffee.  Add this place to your repertoire of very good coffee shops in Tdot, who both 'get it' and won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome cappuccino. Love this place. They also have a really delicious yogurt which is a bonus."}
{"text":"I've been to Milano a few times since it's opened and I plan on going back. I am a fan of their Americanos and love the fact that they have a few beans on the go at the time for you to try out. Also, the limited quantity of beans in their grinder is a good indication of freshness. I plan on coming back on the weekend to check out their pourovers. It's a bit pricier than your typical Starbucks but as a coffee aficionado, I am willing to pay a premium.   Their location is not the greatest and they unfortunately miss out on a lot of the Bay Street traffic, but I'm hoping more people will find out about them because it's a gem!   Ps. customer service is great too; the guys are super friendly and make an effort to recognize their regular customers and really make it seem like a neighbourhood coffee joint."}
{"text":"We ordered Iced Latte and Banana bread. Both of them were very nice. Banana bread was very moist and the flavor was great! My husband loved it so much. The server was energetic and friendly. We will visit there again! :D"}
{"text":"Was seeking a great cup of coffee on last day visit to Toronto and boy did Milano come thru! Co-owner Jerry was informative, gracious, and pleasant making it a perfect mid-morning stop-by for award winning coffee and delish pastry. A classy find!"}
{"text":"It was a nice coffee shop. The entrance was small and I saw the coffee counter, so I thought the place was small, but it was a good size and more seats and spaces than I thought. They had a few steps from the street and the place was higher than street. It made me feel more relaxed and it looked like a hidden place. Coffee was good. They have baked goods and pastries. I had good time there."}
{"text":"Little caf√© with some seating. Have really good mocha. I tried the peanut butter and chocolate one which was excellent. I would definitely come back to try their hazelnut and chocolate one. It's great that they offer these original options. The barista was really friendly and explained the different drinks to me and my friend."}
{"text":"The coffee is great and the people there really know what they're doing, but any cafe that blasts CP24 on a large screen TV has got to be out of their mind. This is not a place to sit down and read a book. It's a place to get a coffee and get the fug out."}
{"text":"Amazing Americano... The owner knows a ton about the different types of beans and their flavours. Be sure to ask him about your drink!"}
{"text":"My favourite new place to grab my morning coffee. Great, friendly staff and probably the best Americano I've ever had. Feels like I'm right back in Italy. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular Milano customer and have been since their opening. The service is extremely warm. The drink menu is extensive and each beverage is crafted with care. Milano also carries some of the best chocolate / almond croissants in town. If you're lucky, you get there just after they've come out of the oven and they're still warm.  I recommend the raspberry mocha!"}
{"text":"My bf and I traveled from NYC and ordered matcha latte and stove top coffee - they are amongst of the BEST we had. Our barista Niel steam my foam perfectly and so is the coffee for my bf. We ended up buying a bag of their beans because of the great taste.  Must try!"}
{"text":"A cute new coffee place close to the financial district, opened just about three weeks ago.   My experience was not quite what I expected but the coffee shop has some merit.   First of all the n terms of the decor and ambience, the place deserves a sold 5/5 as the owners really tried to make it look unique and give it a relaxed feel good vide which I think they totally achieved.   But the positivity stops there. The prices are by far the highest I've seen, even higher than the highest of highs. The reason I say this is that the medium coffee is actually what you might consider small size at a lot of places and a large is a medium and so on. So the bang for the buck is sort of low. Coffee add ins like almond milk are an extra kidney. 3/5  Now the prices might not be a big deal if you say to yourself that you're the type that will pay for quality coffee at a nice coffee joint. The thing is, coffee tasted quite average. Worst of all, I ordered almond milk here, and when the barista was making the coffee he reached down in some dungeon in the floor and got the carton, this looked as sketch as the rub and tug next door to the place. Once again you might say what's the big deal? Well that same night I got terribly Sick and had to call sick into work the next day because apparently the milk that they used had expired. That kept me on the toilet for a solid 5 to 6 hours with no end in sight to loose stool. What a nightmare. 1/5 for coffee taste.   The service was fine. And sort of average. 3/5  So I guess this might not be a great place to start, they might want to learn from the boys over at m square.   Value for money is not the best but if you like to look at the latest interior decor styles you might want to come here."}
{"text":"I'd like to call myself a coffee connoisseur  , but more like just a caffein addict.  A friend and I were looking to get coffee in the area and we were recommended to go here. Firstly let me say, woooow, best americano I have had in a long time. So creamy and delicious. You can even choose the type of beans you want for you coffee which I really like.   This place is so darn cute! It's pretty small but there is enough seating. Really cute decor and super nice  informative baristas. You can tell they really love what they do, and that they really love coffee.   You can even buy take home pounds of the coffee they make which is a huge plus because they have some really nice beans there. Totally check this place out if you're looking for a new coffee place in the area!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on my cappuccino that I tried here.  Here is the verdict Espresso: Medium Crema': OK Milk: Frothed Poorly Latte Art: n/a I would say a mundane version of cappuccino. One can have a better iteration for main chain offerings.  They do offer other variety of beans so I think this is more of a espresso shot spot 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  I usually get the Pour Over, which has great blends.  I recommend Turks Island, very rich and complex.  Service is amazing - you'll never meet two more friendly guys than Christian and Jerry.  Big plus = we are able to discuss Raptors and my home team the Lakers.  Great ambiance, very bright, good sunlight.  Very relaxing place to unwind a bit for the afternoon coffee.  Highly recommend folks to drop in - great addition to the work neighborhood, especially for tech / startups!  My new go-to."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop located right downtown. It has a very welcoming and warm vibe. Owner is very friendly and makes you feel like an instant regular. The coffee has a wow flavour. My Americans  never disappoint! There is a decent amount of seating but the busy busy times are for sure the weekend when it is better for a grab and go coffee!"}
{"text":"I passed by this new coffee roaster which was opened 2 weeks ago. I picked their Americano and it was pretty good. They have a variety of beans for your Expresso drinks. The setting of the store is modern and clean. I won't give a score of 5 since I had better Americano in another place. I will definitely come back for their cappuccino and latte to see if I will give them a higher score next time."}
{"text":"Small, quaint place serving high quality coffee. Amazing selection of Desserts and awesome customer service.   WiFi connectivity was poor but if you are the to go coffee person, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Came across by accident. It was a good accident. I had an excellent flat white. Expertly made."}
{"text":"I was walking by and recognized the \"Milano\" name, as I'm a regular at the Vancouver locations.  I had an almond milk latte and chocolate croissant. Both were delicious.  The space is small, but cozy. The employees working during my visit were very welcoming and warm. I also enjoyed the music they played!  I will return to this MIlano location."}
{"text":"The croissant was fresh and delicious. The Americano was great. The decor is modern and stylish. Great spot."}
{"text":"Decadent pastries to rival a Paris patisserie. Really friendly, unassuming  staff. And a very well-made latte delivered to our table. How civilized. :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite coffee in Toronto. Just excellent and while they take their coffee very seriously the staff are too welcoming and easy going for you to notice just how precise they are about your cup of coffee. I'm an espresso / americano man and Milano's hits a homerun every time. The space is gorgeous and yet very simply designed. I only wish that they would open one up closer to where i live!"}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of coffee and a nice environment to hang around. Bonus, one of the owner is a huge basketball fan!"}
{"text":"The medium bean pour over was fantastic. I want to try the dark blend next.  Great spot, owners are amazing and have lots of stories to tell. Croissants are also quite delicious.  Place has a great name to. Grandissimo caffe!"}
{"text":"I had an Americano and the chocolate chip banana bread, both were delicious. Staff are very friendly and conversational as well. Great place to sit down for a bit and have a coffee and a snack!"}
{"text":"Comment... Seriously, the food courts and Starbucks and Tim Hortons and Thai Islands etc. etc. under Bay Street will turn you're brain to mush with stimulation overload. Plus, queues 10 people deep at Starbucks - forget it. Too much stress for too short life.  Milano Espresso Bar on the other hand... breath in... breath out... breath in... breath out. My espresso (actually a \"Long Black\" yeahiknowshutup.) was deep in flavor and non-acidic. Good pastry and friendly service. Wifi five bars. Listening to the conversation, they seem to, as expected, know their coffee too.  5 stars, I don't know? After the chaos of Bay Street I'd give more for this.Do yourself a favor, visit.   Did I mention the best single cup of coffee I ever had was in Italy in 2001."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop. The two guys working the bar really hustled and worked hard to serve up a terrific cup of coffee. I got the cappuccino with whole milk which I found MUCH better than my wife's nut-milk decaf. Recommendation to the bar-owners: make your own nut milk rather than using store bought junk. Otherwise, the ambiance and products were outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little place. They do know their coffee. Friendly personnel, reasonable prices, and a large variety of different brew styles await you."}
{"text":"It was confusing to find - on Google Maps it shows up as Rialto, but on Yelp (and in the store) it shows up as Milano. However, I saw a sign that they are re-branding back to Rialto??   I stopped by this cafe for a few hours on a Friday afternoon to do some work. The baristas were not particularly warm or friendly, and it took a while to order as they were chatting about something in the back. The cortado looked nice, but it wasn't very strong or smooth, and it felt like a watery latte. They have some pastries and desserts available, such as cookies, banana bread, Daily Press juices, and food/snack options such as packaged sandwiches and salads, but none of it seemed very appetizing.   Wifi was pretty much nonexistent, but there are a few tables and seats available to sit down. It's popular with the businesses around the area, as I noticed a lot of people seeming to come by for their afternoon coffee break.   The AC also makes the place quite chilly if you're sitting there for more than an hour. Washrooms are clean, but the nonexistent wifi and lacklustre cortado was disappointing."}
{"text":"I happened to stop by because I was in the area but was surprised by the quality of service and the latte itself. The cafe is simple in design with shy pops of colors that brighten up the simplistic theme. The staff is funny, helpful and attentive to their clients. The latte I had was rich in flavor and with the milk frothed to perfection, no sweetener is necessary so you can truly appreciate the beverage. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The Americano is delicious! Nice modern decor, free wifi. Not the most friendly service - they gotta work on those barista smiles."}
{"text":"Coffee was great. And the shot of espresso with panna was even better.   Great location and the owner was friendly.   I went in the morning (around 9:30 during a work day) and it was busy so I had to sit at the bar for a bit and then move to a table. It was a good work and leisure environment - if you're into the hustle and bustle of downtown city coffee shops.   Decor was what I expected - not too hipster or too modern, but enough abstract art on the wall and coffee mainstream decor, combined with wood benches, to make it work.   I also tried the margarita danish. I wish they would heat up their food though. It was a smaller selection than I thought.   Overall, decent and I would bunker down there again should I be staying in the area."}
{"text":"What a charming little spot! We stumbled by this place while walking down Adelaide, looking for a spot to grab a quick warm drink.   This place is humble yet chic. Very trendy, but minimalistic decor, clean and tidy, with sweet, humble, friendly, and prompt service. It was late morning, and I wasn't feeling a coffee, so I opted for a London Fog. They only sell their London Fogs in one size (a Large) - and while I initially thought $4.00 was pricey for one drink, the Large was.... well, large. Akin to a Starbucks Grande, but slightly bigger. Decent value. The drink itself was nice and sweet, went down perfectly smoothly, and just the perfect temperature. Overall, really happy with it.   While they do have tea lattes, coffee is clearly their true love. Coffee contraptions filled the barista area, and they had packaged beans on sale for you to take home, if you happen to fall in love with their brews. Can't wait to come back and try more of their products!  For a London Fog, with tax, my total came to $4.20."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp as I'm looking for a coffee that taste closer to Rome's. I had their latte and it was really good. Nicely handcrafted. I like the rustic feel outside but the inside interior isn't as welcoming & relaxing enough to stay and enjoy your cup of coffee. The ambience lacks that inviting feels. Service was ok not great. Price point is better  than starbucks / other specialty coffee shops."}
{"text":"Great little coffee place off Adelaide. Went there today for the first time: their coffee selection is great and changes daily. The staff is very knowledgeable and super friendly. I had a capuccino and it was delicious. Much better than Starbucks and much more enjoyable experience as well. They seem to also have some good breakfast pastries, muffins etc. I will try it next time and if great will add a 5th star.  Also, they do catering to offices which I will try next time. Will report back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've noticed place.  Tiny, unassuming, boutique coffeehouse located across the street from the venue that run events in sometimes.  I love their style.  Clean. Crisp.  I ordered a latte macchiato.   A little short of perfect but still tasty.    Definitely going back more often to try some of their other products.  Service was very good.  I would recommend this place to coffee connoisseurs to try at least once. Til next time!"}
{"text":"I think this place definitely lives up to the message found on the wall inside the shop, \"Never Imitate. Authenticate\". Was walking around Adelaide and stumbled into this coffee shop which apparently orignated in Vancouver. Decided to try their Raspberry Mocha and it was quite good. As I have never seen or tried one before I first imagined it to be a pink/reddish cup of coffee. In the end it still looked the same as any regular mocha. I decided to try it with whipped cream on top as well.  I got the medium sized cup but it was actually quite small.  I had originally planned to sip it slowly but I finished my cup in 5 minutes. The medium is almost equivalent to a tall at Starbucks, but slightly shorter.  The paper cup also has a print of Brian Turko's signature who I later learned is a \"Master Roaster\" and makes great and prize winning coffee blends.   Each sip tasted quite unique as this is the first time that I have had coffee with raspberry flavour. It kind of tastes like 30% raspberry jam, 20% chocolate, and 50% coffee.  It was a nice deviation from the typical mocha flavours and not bland.  It is definitely a small shop located on Adelaide. The storefront looks quite narrow on the outside 7 there's a small steep set of steps to get inside. There are outlets under the seats next to your table as well if you need to charge up. A little pricier but all in all I liked the uniqueness of their menu items and will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Their americano is good and so was the almond croissant! I'm coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"What a place! Nice hidden gem, the coffee is to die for!!! So glad I found this place! Had a medium pour over, dark roast, finally amazing Java! Very relaxed ambience!"}
{"text":"Great little shop with some Italian character! Great host who makes amazing cappuccino!"}
{"text":"Love this little cafe, really chic and clean. The staff is so friendly and are willing to accommodate special orders, always lovely visiting here!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for about two years now and every single time has been an amazing experience. The owners/baristas love for the customer shines through in every drop. Either its the superb customer service offering you water as you wait for your order to be brewed or its the very nice selection of specialty drink options, this place has it all.  Only small gripe is that it's a little small but everything else is perfect.  Notes: - Even if I order drinks I don't usually have anywhere else (looking at you cappuccino), it's smooth and tastes beautiful. - Does a wonderful job with Ritual app orders."}
{"text":"The hedgehog latte was divine! Also loved the almond croissant. Regular latte was also good. Not many seats in the cafe but love how bright and airy it is."}
{"text":"I had a long black for the first time. It is kind of like an americano but made differently. Basically hot water and espresso. The coffee was very good and not bitter at all. They have some yummy lattes on their menu. Can't wait to come and try them all."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Recent rebranding has made this spot a bit confusing... is it Rialto? Milano? which is it?  It's Rialto since the beginning of this year but unlike the renaming, much of the old menus, Ritual ordering, and online info is a blend of old and new.  So if you're confused, don't worry... they're making it hard for you to know their name.  The spot is clean and in a cute historical building right beside a Toronto firehall.  There's a few high top tables and lower tables where you can sit for a bit to enjoy a cup of coffee.  They do use a locally roasted bean for their coffees.  They have several offering but use the dark forte (?) for the espresso shots that day.  In addition to the coffee, you can choose a few pastries on display.  They have a few sweet, a few savoury, and a few sugary ones to catch your attention.  As for the espresso based drinks, they've got some serious sugary ones that can tempt any sugar fiend... mocha with white and dark chocolate?  hazelnut mocha?  Oh yes ... many options but they also offer the classics and we stuck with those on a Sunday morning.  Service was quick and pleasant even with only one person manning the entire place.  I dont think anyone waited very long to get their drink at all.    Flat White - A decent pour and latte art to craft this flat white. I would say this was closer to a cappuccino than a flat white with more milk and froth on top.  It still was enjoyable as the beans they used were dark and not acidic.  3.5/5  Overall, it's a decent spot in the middle of Toronto.  I would say that with so many great options nearby, you can probably find your perfect cup elsewhere but in a pinch, this would be a decent option to get your caffeine kick."}
{"text":"The coffee here is great, but the music is so loud. It's like you're in a nightclub, where the only thing they serve is non-alcoholic caffeinated drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bit of coffee, and a place to charge my phone. Found a great spot!  Milano has been opened for 8 months now, and originates from Vancouver. Our guy who greeted us was incredibly informative, friendly and cared very much about the service. The menu has pretty extensive variety for coffee lovers (i.e. pour over coffee, lattes, americanos, mochas) and all reasonably priced. I ordered a Hedgehog Mocha, which has 2 shots of expresso, chocolate, and a shot of hazelnut, topped with whipped cream. I got the Regular size ($4), which was more than enough for me to sip on. Large would be $4.8.  My friend tried out their seasonal drink, which was the White Pumpkin latte (name to be determined). We call this the \"beta\" testing, because they are still crowdsourcing opinions on it. Our opinion? Very nice and smooth, did not have a truckload of \"PUMPKIN-SPICE-IN-YOUR-FACE\" flavour, which was a nice change from the Sbux PSL. Much more subtle. It tasted festive, but more of a refined pumpkin taste. I loved that they asked us for our opinion and really listened. They explained their process when experimenting with making this new recipe, how many shots of pumpkin flavour, etc....made the experience very personal.  The service was very friendly, and can definitely sense their passion for the coffee bean. Spoiler alert - they will be rolling out a holiday menu soon, so I'm excited to come back to see!   P.S. - they have an outlet almost at every sitting spot, so ideal for a \"recharge\" (get it?)"}
{"text":"I walk by this place a lot and didn't realize this was a coffee shop until I stumbled upon it on Yelp. I would put this place in the category of a \"pick up and go\" type of coffee shop as there aren't too many tables for someone to work or study at. It's not a bad spot if you want to catch up with one other friend, but you may have some trouble fitting in a 3rd.   Ordered the hedgehog mocha, which comes with 2 shots of espresso, dark chocolate, hazelnut, etc. - definitely tasted more like chocolate than it does a cup of coffee. I opted for lactose free milk and a medium came to a little over $5 - albeit pricey but cheaper than Starbucks for sure and tastes much better."}
{"text":"This place should be called We Don't Have That' because guess what, whatever you order from the menu, they don't have.   Some confusion as to the ownership change and old menus still posted that are no longer in effect. The coffee wasn't good enough for me to figure out the issue or ever go back."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, great cappuccino, nice atmosphere for working.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Milano is a Coffee Roasters and Cafe based in Vancouver and this location is their first non Vancouver location.  I love the simple and chic interior. The Macchiato ($3.25) I ordered was a nice and bold flavour with a nice crema.  On a weekday 11:00 am, I could not find a table to enjoy my coffee but I did enjoy sipping mine at the bar area.  Service is definitely a 4 star. While I was sipping my coffee, one of the barista serves me a glass of cold water without me requesting for one!   Definitely worth coming to Milano for an espresso drink when you are in the area!  I can't wait when they have the espresso tasting bar set up like in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Morden Cafe with lovely decor and great latte. They have very cute names like hedgehog mocha or killer mocha."}
{"text":"Super cool tiny spot with great quality products. We tried the PBJ Cappuccino and the barista took the time to explain and suggest a drink for my girlfriend. She is newer to the real world of coffee so it was super helpful and her drink as she said was, perfection!  I also tried the large cocoa ginger snap cookie which was pretty good and went really well with my beverage.   Decor an atmosphere is super fresh and cozy, but man is it tiny. Prices were pretty high, but I'll stop by again if I'm in the area. Neat spot. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The coffee is pretty good. Decent place to work with WIFI and outlets. The food is just ok. I do like the pour over coffee."}
