{"text":"Best shisha I ever smoked been to many places like Roxy's and habbibiz in local Scarborough area and this place is the place to go in Scarborough. Friendly people and respectful owner with great customer service. Have all the flavors with fast service.  If you smoke here you won't go to any other shisha place in the gta. Has belly dancers, projectors, poker table... Play live raptors games and sports. House mix is nearly unmatched. Don't forget about the food it's so good will catch you by surprise how good it is. Would definitely go back... If you haven't come already you just don't know."}
{"text":"Seems like kids under 18 are serving in a smoking 19+ environment and the first shisha place I have been to where they charge for extra coal. 25 cent per coal - Overall unprofessional and don't bother."}
{"text":"I like that this place has a very large projector that plays music videos and sports. It's right at the centre of the cafe. There's also a pool table. Located on the second floor of the plaza, there is not much foot traffic - meaning you'd have to know of the place in order to go there for shisha. There are private rooms where people use the PS3s for videos etc. There is also an area for poker tournaments that go on everyday. 

Overall, there aren't many people there, but it is a decent place for hanging out casually with friends. They play good music. Oddly enough, there is a hardwood area in the centre in front of the projector that can serve as a dance floor, but it isn't used."}
