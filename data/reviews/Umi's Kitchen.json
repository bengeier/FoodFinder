{"text":"Good Day, thank you for reading my review.  Umi's Kitchen is Nirvana for those who appreciate quality delicious food.  The fantastic food coupled with incredible service is where everyone should be lined up for!  See you there!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken on salad! Very flavourful yet not too heavy! Stuffed Jamaican party was also a nice balanced addition."}
{"text":"Finally went to Umi's after almost two years living in Cabbagetown! The food is flavorful, generous and a great value for the price.  I ordered the large curry chicken to go, the food is piping hot - the rice is flavored with kidney beans and theres about four pieces of curry chicken. If you don't like meat with bones, then opt for another dish.

Repeat business?  Yes!  

Will return for the oxtail, the jerk chicken and the stuffed patties.  Lunch time special is $4.99 for the small size between 11am to 3pm could be worth it but will update when I try it out."}
{"text":"Walked in hungry and walked out full and happy. $12 got me and my bf two jerk chicken lunch specials and a drink. Meat was fall off the bone tender and the peas in the rice and peas were perfect."}
{"text":"Best goat curry in the city!!! Love their jerk chicken as well. The food here is Tender, flavoursome and they're always servicing generous portions. Definitely worth the money. My new go to Caribbean spot"}
{"text":"I ordered the Jerk Salad. I requested she remove the skin from the chicken which she did. It was AWESOME and filling. Great flavours. The daily lunch specials are also a FANTASTIC value, for $5 you wont be hungry until dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered through JUSTEAT on my credit card two hours before their listed close- got an email (no phone call) about a half an hour after they had accepted the order and processed the payment on my card saying they wouldn't be following through.

So now I get to wait about four business days for a refund.

If you don't have a delivery driver or are unwilling to travel an 8 minute drive to deliver food, don't accept the payment. Completely disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered a small oxtail with rice n peas.  Very generous portion for a small order.  Very tasty and tender meat.  I'd order it again.  The only thing missing was some coleslaw.  Also, there's no plantain on the menu which I really missed.  This is a nice addition to the neighbourhood."}
