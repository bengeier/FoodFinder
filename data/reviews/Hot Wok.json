{"text":"One of the best Hakka Chinese places!  This is one of our top 10 places to eat. (its Halal) The service is friendly and fast. What we usually order:  -Hakka beef chow mein -Hot wok spicy wings -Sweet corn Chicken soup/ Hot & Sour soup -Chilly Shrimp with Gravy ( it comes with rice)  Everything is Excellent! This place is also located in a good place, easy to get there by ttc."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times and the chili chicken and chili beef lunch specials are perfect. The hot and sour soup is unlike anything else I've ever tried and the dipping sauce for the pakora chicken/fish is brilliant. I'd eat here every day if I thought my stomach could handle it. Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a Hidden gem! My favorite Chinese place! Candi runs the counter, she is awesome! There is seatting inside, and the take out is Fresh and Quick!"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of a family together at HOTWOK. The atmosphere was wonderful and cozy. The staff was friendly and very professional. But the the food, no one could have prepared me for how wonderful and  delicious food."}
{"text":"Went in there with hopes that we we have another option besides Kami; unfortunately this restaurant does not serve fresh food which is to evident at first bite! Tried Moo Goo, mixed vegetables and wonton soup all of which I had to throw away after first bite! I recommend changing strategy, use fresh ingredients, also much less oil, and raise the price if you have to!  Kami still best option in town..."}
{"text":"Hot Wok offers a variety of dishes for $5.50 as part of their lunch special.  We decided to grab lunch from them today since it was close by.  We were at the restaurant at about 1:15pm and the lady said that because it was a special day, they have to charge the dinner price $6.25 instead of the lunch price.  It's only $0.75 but it makes no sense to me considering the portions are not any bigger.     Appears to me that the owner of Hot Wok is one who likes to gouge customers for money.  I don't support unethical and business owners with no morals.  The food is not even good enough to compensate for their sneaky practices."}
{"text":"I love this place. 2 min away from my house. Best place to eat in scaborough. Amazing owner, very welcoming. Chilie chicken gravy is the best dish they have."}
{"text":"always fast and fresh...family love to eat here and take out...prices are fair and serving large..so come hungry"}
{"text":"For the price & for what you get it's really not that good. There are other Chinese restaurants in the area that are better for half the price."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they put rice under your main course. I wish they didn't do that. I would be willing to pay a little more for a main course in the dinner combination plates that didn't have rice layered under it."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Scarborough, my friend took me to all the places she used to frequent in the area when she lived here. Places she thought I'd enjoy - and Hot Wok was one of those places. Since then, I have come to Hot Wok on a number of times, mostly with that same friend.   It had been a while since I had revisited Hot Wok, and then I saw it be reviewed on Yelp - and it made me want to come back all over again. So I convinced a couple other yelpers to join me on yet another Hakka meal.   The food was mostly as I remembered it - good, but not great. Greasy, bright coloured and mildly spicy. We ordered a variety of dishes and this was the verdict:   - Chicken Pakoras - Were WAY too greasy, even for me. But the sauce it came with was yummy!  -Chili Chicken - This is the one dish my friend and I would always get when we came here. I remember this dish being much better; more spicy and less gummy. I was let down by it this time around.  -Manchurian Noodle - I really enjoyed this. Yes, it was oily - but I didn't mind it.  -Manchurian Vegetable Fried Rice - For some reason this had a vinegary taste to it (that only I could detect). But I still enjoyed it - I love rice in all its forms.   The friend that introduced me to this place no longer wants to come here - she just doesn't like it anymore. But I might return - Whenever I have a craving for some greasy, spicy Hakka food. Hopefully by the time I return, the Chili Chicken will be back to being the way I remember it."}
{"text":"Tried sesame chicken lunch special - lets just say I am sorry I did - no redeeming value in rice eggroll or chicken. Chicken rubbery - dark meat and battered heavy. Rice had a few peas and carrots - no taste. Live and learn. Not for my liking. Keep searching for NY style chinese food"}
{"text":"Under rated at a great price. Tangra masala chicken is great. Whole in the wall blink and you'll miss it but it is worth it. One of the best hakkas in Scarborough."}
{"text":"If your a foodie for spicy food this place a must, quick but tasty food, fresh never soggy or stale, super busy during whole Week, dry chilly chicken and crispy beef with mixed noodles is my thing, and fish and shrimp pakoras too, chef/owner Simon is always willing to hear you out, but wont bother changing if you mistakenly order something else lol but still tastes amazing! You can spice it up to ur liking. Single Bathrooms, bright decor and tv with two entrances. Plastic water cups and water jugs available immediately."}
{"text":"We have been eating lunch sometimes here for years because it is close to work. Food is okay but very cheap. We went today and I think it may be the last time for me. They were closed for \"renovations\" awhile back and it is as dirty and ugly looking as it was before. The bathroom is disgusting. The waitress then made a mistake with our order but we let it go. They charged us for her mistake and when I explained that they mixed up our order the OWNER went on to lecture us about how next time we should tell him because now he is paying for the mistake. I pointed out that the waitress never came to ask us how our lunch was, never giving us an opportunity to tell her. Whatever. Total \"Hole in the Wall\". For sure not any kind of dining experience. Best for take out.  It's great if you like horrible service, dirty room and your food deep fried and drenched in sauce."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new Hakka place and came across some decent reviews online about a place called Hot Wok. As I was going to be in the area, I figured I'd give it a try so as to compare to other Hakka establishments in Toronto.   First off, the location is in a small plaza just outside of Kennedy Commons and is pretty hard to miss as it's in the corner of said plaza. The interior leaves a lot to be desired, but it's clean and well organized.  The one key difference which immediately set Hot Wok apart from the other Hakka places is service. The staff, which I assume to be a family was courteous, warm and communicative, and everything went well in the service department. 5/5 stars here.   When we went the restaurant was completely empty but there was a steady supply of customers who came to order take-out. This is a good sign that people enjoy the food and I was pleased to see that others were coming for the food.  As for the food itself, there are certainly better Hakka places around. My favourite being Great Eastern Esquire. The chilli chicken is not as good as other places, but the one key differential is that this place uses a lot of sauce for the dishes.   The food is adequate and there were no noticeable issues. The service was outstanding and the delivery was speedy. All in all, I'd recommend it if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Hakka style cuisine. I ordered the dry chili chicken and it was  delicious.  Prepare for the spice! My wife ordered satay shrimp and they made it dry style instead of sauced.  The flavour was amazing but the shrimp was only the baby shrimp.    Good place to check out for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"So I literally just finished eating my food from hot wok and said to myself, I have to write a review. I've been to a hakka restaurant in the past and it was pretty terrible. This experience is a 10/10. I ordered by phone because I found the menu online. I ordered, chicken Masala fried rice, hakka chicken chow mein, & beef with vegetables. The food was ready for pick up in only 15 mins! Amazing. Also, not to mention, the food was great, and there were heaping portions. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. My boyfriend & I really liked it."}
{"text":"It is average Chinese although better than the other take-out Chinese options locally. My husband and I both ordered the General Tso's chicken. I like that the chunks of chicken were smaller and bite-sized compared to most takeout places. The sauce was very sweet which I typically like a little more heat in my sauce. The place was packed so it must be pretty popular!"}
{"text":"Went to Hot Wok for my Friday night dinner. Was not impressed with the restaurant itself when I walked in. Things behind the counter looked extremely nasty and dirty. I ordered some General Tso's chicken with the Lo Mein which I was charged extra for.   The chicken was not anything to write home about. It wasn't spicy at all and there were lots of pieces that were solely pieces of breeding with no chicken inside. Some of the pieces of chicken seemed a bit under cooked. Overall, I would give the chicken a 3/5.   However, the Lo Mein was what really got me upset. I paid extra to have the Lo Mein and was expecting something good. The noodles were flavorless and didn't have any taste. It was almost as if you were eating cardboard. Overall the Lo Mein would get a 1/5.   Wasn't really impressed with the atmosphere or the food here. I probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll admit - I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, except for one thing:  Mei Fun!  I've had this dish from multiple Chinese restaurants and no one can do it as well as Hot Wok.  I always get Singapore style, and theirs actually contains visible meat within it - unlike \"Panda\" restaurant a few miles down the road!  Hot Wok's tea is great too!"}
{"text":"Came here after a post workout meal. Ordered the crispy honey chicken and hot wok fried rice. Expected the dishes to be salty but it actually wasn't! The meat dish came with a medium Styrofoam white rice too.   The price is really reasonable. We're gonna come back for the chili chicken. Will probably come back because of the price, portions, and not salty dishes."}
{"text":"I took out the family combination, the combination was perfect for four people $36.99, you get to choose four entrées with white rice or fried, soup we chose  egg drop soup which was excellent , then 4 eggrolls and we got to order different main dishes, I ordered lo mein chicken with vegetables, there was one ordered lo mein with just vegetables, lo mein with shrimp & vegetables, The last one we ordered was lo mein with vegetables and pork.   For a family this is the best combination to order ,there was leftovers for the next day.  And of course we had our fortune cookies that was fun to read."}
{"text":"The chicken was rubbery, no crispy pieces. The fried rice had little to no veggies. The Lo mein comes in one size only, no other option. Pricey for a combo plate at almost $9. Overall bland and almost a chemical taste. Definitely will drive to New China."}
{"text":"Came here frequently for lunch to get chili chicken less sauce on rice. Found disgusting hair in food today. Never going back"}
{"text":"It's really hit or miss depending on who is working. Used to order from here quite a bit but prefer other hakka restaurants better lately."}
{"text":"Hot Wok is a typical Chinese takeout place but towards the lower end of quality in my experience.  Service was fast and efficient.  Food piping hot.  Prices +-$11 per entree.  Food quality just fair. The General Tso's  Chicken seemed more like a sweet and (weak) sour dish.  We ordered extra Tso's  sauce on the side but it was omitted.  Very little broccoli in it.  Chicken Hibachi was bland.  Best dish we had was Vegetable Delight.  Nice dish of fresh veggies in a brown sauce.  House Special Fried Rice was ok.  They neglected to add any condiments to the order.  Apparently it is self serve at the counter.  Would I eat there again.  Yes - but only because it was my first visit.    Perhaps it was an off day."}
{"text":"So I'm new to the Wesley Chapel area and I was pleased to find that I had a Chinese restaurant so close to my new home. However that quickly changed with my first order. Now I've never wrote a bad review on any establishment in my life. So Hot Wok definitely earned this one. First off I'm almost sure a child answered the phone to take my order. Which threw me off a bit but I suppose having your kids help out at work isn't all that bad. Just a little unprofessional.  When I asked a simple question about the menu I was put on hold then after a short wait an adult woman answered the phone and quickly took my order. Chicken, shrimp, and broccoli was an easy enough order and it was decently priced. I called in the order then waited 10 minutes and then headed out to pick up my food. All in all about a 15 minute process. The food was ready to go when I arrived. Now I read the horrible reviews before I placed my order. I knew that the food could be tasteless or worse ... just simply gross.  Or that the service could be bad. But I figured I would give them a shot anyways. However neither of those was the reason I'm giving Hot Wok a one star. My one star rating is based on this. As I was chewing a piece of broccoli I bit down on what I can only describe as a rock. It was hard and a little bigger then piece of rice. And it hurt. I spat out my food and tried to do a little investigating and noticed it was white chunk of something with a purplish hue. After that I did a little digging around in my food for any hint or indication of what this little fragment could be. And then I found another piece. This one was about the size of clam shell. Oh and that's because it was a large sharp fragment of a clam shell. Might I add in a dish that didn't have clams. Quite concerning. If this had been a meal meant for a child these shell fragments could have caused a choking hazard and a simple night of relaxing with Chinese food could have taken a serious turn. So I can not stress this enough. Spend your money elsewhere. However if you do dare to eat at this establishment... Do some detective work and check your food for shells or other choking hazards that don't belong in your meal before chowing down."}
{"text":"We love this Chinese restaurant and I'm glad it's so close to our home. They give large portions for a very expected and reasonable price and everything is always very fresh tasting. The menu is the same as any other small storefront Chinese restaurant you've ever been to, so don't look for anything surprising or special. Their daughter may answer the phone sometimes to help out mom, so if you have a special request, make sure you ask for her mother."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. What more can I say?  Lunch special are good and inexpensive. The quantities are way more than enough to get full.  For dinner, my family will occasionally get the family pack. 4 dinner items with rice, soup and four eggrolls.   Good deal."}
{"text":"By far the best dry chilli chicken I ever had. The appetizer calamari is fantastic too."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, great price, friendly service. Will definitely be returning. Had plenty of leftovers for future meals. I ordered chilli chicken, upgraded to fried rice, and a side of wonton, not disappointed at all...thoroughly enjoyed this meal. Thanks for great service and a great price."}
{"text":"It's been quite a Journey learning of Hakka cuisine in the Toronto scene. It's amazing to realize how little I knew/know of this Hakka Indian-Chinese offering. This being said, I'm sure there are even more people that know even less than I do or not at all. Some people will love it and other dislike it, while as for myself...   I can definitely feel myself being bias without initially realizing it and it is simply because this cuisine is confusing to myself as a Chinese descendant. We're probably looking/dissecting for that Chinese element and flair in every dish while not understanding this is not Chinese food but rather it's own distinctive cuisine, Hakka Indian-Chinese.   To see the brilliance of this cuisine is to see it in the eyes of the people of this culture and the people that frequent Hakka Indian-Chinese restaurants. To breakdown each part of the Hakka, Indian, Chinese individually and then assemble it back together to make it altogether something unqiue, unfamiliarly-familiar if you will.  2.5'd  It's just very unfortunate that I've figured that when I break the dish down to it's particles, that I know the reason for my natural personal MEH for this cuisine at no fault to the cuisine itself. Factors such as deep-frying, overly starched Soups/Sauces, orange/brown colored monotone presentation, hot spices. Just as where I cannot force someone to love Stinky Tofu nor Duck Tongue, I have a preference for some Hakka Indian-Chinese dishes over majority of others.   Chicken Pakora - Love that spicy Chimichurri-esque dipping sauce(+0.5 Star). The Tandoor spice on the Chicken gives the Croquette a darker tinge than other places but at the same time less flour-coated due to the smaller size. I like the juiciness and spiciness.  Chilli Chicken(Gravy) - Bland starchy Gravy doesn't give much to the lightly floured deep-fried Chicken. I still don't understand why they call this Chili Chicken when no hint of spice was there. This looks more Canadian-Chinese if I wasn't in a Hakka restaurant.   Manchurian Noodle - First experience with this dish and basically felt like it was a version of Shanghai Fried Noodle with the distinctive Indo spice. See what I did there? Refer to Chinese again, my bad! Give me time...   Manchurian Vegetable Egg Fried Rice - First experience with this dish, so you already know by NOW what I'm going to say so peace out."}
{"text":"Decent food. The shrimp with mixed veggies and rice lunch special is a must try. Staff is nice as well. Food can get a bit saucy so I always ask for less sauce. Other than that it's your average local Hakka  restaurant with your average food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We always order to-go and the food is hot and fresh. The vegetable fried rice is some of the best I've ever had. The chili chicken with gravy is a MUST. Almost everyone who comes here usually orders that. We order it mild because it tends to be a little too spicy for my taste, but other than that it's great. Don't let the appearance of the place keep you from coming in and giving it a try."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food!  Everything I have tried here has been slightly better than average, however the customer service is great. The woman that runs the front is always super friendly and welcoming, and its the little things like that that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Food is always good never dissapoints late night or lunch on point. May not be the most lavish and upscale but when your in a rush they make sure you leave quick and with big portions."}
{"text":"This is going to be short as there's nothing outstanding about this restaurant.   I only come here for the chili chicken (dry) - make sure you have something to drink!!!  There's also the caution warning of overload of oil of the noodles. & the waitress is kinda bitchy (but that's okay if you get take-out)."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: - I think I have become a health freak... I just cannot eat anything that is too oil.. soaked in oil... deep fried and then soak in oil - so the fellowing review is bias, opinionated... and may not be relevant to you!  I love Indian food! I love Chinese food! But just I still have not feel the love when they decide to become Hakka Indian food...  Hot Wok is quite nice and clean and dare I say Modern compare to some of the Hakka place I have been... The large Plasma TV on the wall is showing hot music video the whole time we were eating here...  Chicken Pakora ($8.50) - after my Federick incident... \"The Worst Pakora in Toronto?\" I still have not find a place that serve anything that is worse than that... - Here the chicken has been marinated with tandoori based spice... and then dipped in batter than deep fried.. has a lot of flavours - The dipping sauce is AMAZING! Spicy.. refreshing and a little sour.. which balanced out the oilness of the pakora  Chilli Chicken ($8.50) - Chicken deep fried then stired fried in this thick and heavy dark sauce! - No sight of Chili?? I was looking for it really hard? Maybe my dinner mate ate them all when I was watching and singing along with the music video?  Manchurian Noodle ($7.75) - Huge Huge Huge Plate of Noodle piled sky high!! - This is one of the time that you wish that the portion is not that huge...  - Noodle itself as is is not bad.. have quite a good bite...but with all these oil dripping ... make it not my kind of noodle  Manchurian Vegetable Egg Fried Rice ($6.95) - Huge portion again.. every piece of rice is soaked in oil - I am not a rice person..so I never feel the love and joy when a huge plate of rice in front of me and I have to eat that! - My dinner mate that insist in ordering some rice hardly touch it because she was complaining about a vinegar taste... which none of us detect that  Service here is indifferent, but efficient... typical Chinese restaurant.. Waitress has more interest talking to the 2 young male patrons than serving us.  We have tons of leftover and I hope my yelp friend ate that at home as midnight snack will have better experience after heating them up in the microwave..."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good Chinese food and thought I would try Hot Wok as it is near my house. Sadly the food I tried was barely edible. I ordered Pepper Steak and General Tao's Chicken.   I couldn't even chew the pepper steak. Meat was of poor quality and sauce was meh.   The chicken wasn't much better. No real spice to the sauce. Very sweet. Tons of breading, tons of sauce and little poor quality pieces of chicken. Breading was mushy and not crisp.  Would not order from where again."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Chinese food fix since I've been in the area and this definitely wasn't it. They do get a 2 because of friendly service and they have great shrimp egg rolls. I ordered house lomein lunch special for a up charge... It was far more rice than lomein, and the lomein left lots to be desired, lacking flavor and freshness the two components which are key in a lomein in my opinion. The crab Rangoon was disgusting. I'm used to star shaped or triangle shaped sweet crispy Rangoon. This Rangoon was a pouch of cream cheese that was greasy dense deep fried mess!  I might stop by for a egg roll until I find a better place in the area but I will definitely not be ordering anything else off of the menu."}
{"text":"Food was very good .. Very busy place need more staff. Very small inside best to take out rather then dine in."}
