{"text":"Muy rico.
Delicious authentic Mexican burritos. Best we've had in Calgary. Clean and friendly service and amazing food."}
{"text":"When my friend and I got to Jalapeno's, it was dead, probably because it was 11:40am, so we got a table. Lucky for us, as only ten minutes later the place was packed. Jalapeno's is a tiny, very clean and bright  place, with some simple Mexican decor. The menu is small, which I also like, since lunch is short, it's nice not to be bogged down with too many options to read over. I ordered the Plato, which means the tortilla, if you choose to have one, is on the side. There are no servers, all the food is splayed out buffet style with a good sized sneeze glass in front of it, Subway style, you are asked to choose your meat and any additions and sauces, on top of your rice, refried beans and salad. 
My food was good, but I found the portion size a little small for the $12 I paid, particularly when it came to the meat. The rice was fluffy, the salad and tortilla ( corn or wheat are both options) was fresh and the meat juicy. My only two small complaints were 1. the beans were salty an 2. I wish the people who served us were a little bit friendlier. They weren't rude by any means, but it's nice to have someone crack at least ONE smile when you thank them for your order. 
I can't say I would seek jalapeños out again seeing as I live down south, but it's definitely a nice option for those who work in the area. I know it does well at lunch rush. We had a group of four eye balling our table as we cleared our plates away. We hasn't even completely left the table before they threw their keys and bags down to snatch up the spot. . ."}
{"text":"My search for authentic Mexican food in Calgary is over!

Jalapeño's Mexican Grill serves up tacos, quesadillas, tostadas and other stapes you expect to find in just about any typical Mexican eatery. 

I ordered a plate of four tacos for $12. The filling choices included beef, chicken, and pork. I went for two types of beef and two types of chicken fillings:

bistec (seasoned beef)
barbacoa de lengua (BBQ beef tongue)
tinga (seasoned shredded chicken)
adobado (marinated chicken)

The tacos were served on lightly grilled corn tortillas (as they should be!). I was given the option to add tomato, cilantro, onion, or pico de gallo (a mixture of those three). I chose pico de gallo with a bit of extra tomato. The only thing missing was lime, but my request was quickly met when I asked for some. 

A total of nine sauces are available in a self-serve area, with three labeled spice levels: mild, medium, and hot. Each spice level has three choices: salsa roja (red sauce), salsa verde (green sauce), and salsa de aguacate (avocado sauce). The owner, who's from Monterrey, was super helpful when I asked him about the salsas and explained that everything was made in-house from fresh ingredients (no canned tomatoes in these salsas!). Various roasted peppers including serrano, guajillo, and habanero peppers give Jalapeño's delicious salsas their rich flavours. 

After covering my tacos in all three \"medium\" sauces and squeezing every last drop from my lime wedges, I bit in while listening to some Mexican music.. The medium proved to be just the right level of spice for me, and every bite brought me back to my days of relaxation in Tulum and Puerto Escondido. Though I felt it was an adventurous choice, I wasn't a big fan of the barbacoa de lengua. Luckily, the other three tacos were a hit. It got a little messy towards the end, so I might recommend paying an extra $1.50 to double up the tortillas.

¡Qué rico!"}
{"text":"I had been hoping to try this place for a while, and had pretty high expectations, albeit based on nothing more than the clean design of the storefront sign and the fact that they play Food Network constantly on the flat screen TV.  In the end, I ordered four soft tacos (two chicken and two beef tongue) and the tres leche cake, and was underwhelmed. The chicken was unremarkable. The beef (lengua) was tender, and had good flavour, but the pico de gallo that topped it was bland. 

I want some cilantro pop, some onion tang, some tomato acid zing when I have pico, but all of these were missing. The double-wrapped soft shell lengua at Los Chilitos was better, for a little less money, and doesn't have to be purchased in groups of four.  The salsa bar at Jalepeños has smooth green, white, and red salsas each in mild, medium and hot. It's nice to have this array of sauces, but they weren't as interesting as let's say Chico's Tecate Grill with its smoky and chunky options.

The tres leche cake was okay, though ideally you'd wait a while for it to come room temperature as it's straight from the fridge. It tastes store-made, but that's to be expected.  Overall, Jalepeños executes an okay menu, but as detailed above, other places on town do various aspects better, earning them a middle of the road three starts."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month and get the beef tongue burrito.  I'm generally very satisfied with food although sometimes the meat seems fattier than usual.  If you are looking for delicious Mexican fast food, this is a good place.

Portions are extremely generous for what you pay so be a nice person and tip the nice gentleman.  

Must must try the Horchata drink, healthy and oh so refreshing!"}
{"text":"I walk 10 blocks just to have lunch here because I do love what they have going on. If you love Chipotle chains in the states, you'll love this place as it's the same concept and almost the same offerings. The portion size is generous and the taste is authentic. I love their refried beans.

This is not a big place by any stretch of the imagination but it'll still comfortably seat ~30 people. I love sitting by the bar stools which are in front of the street-facing windows and people-watching as I eat

What I don't like: They don't serve guacamole or melted cheese dip before 2pm. Those are like the best parts of a mexican meal and they can't offer it at lunchtime? Not good."}
{"text":"My first 5***** review!

Let me tell you, the food here was way beyond my expectations, I had the chicken tacos and my friends had the burritos and none of us left hungry, the food was fresh and the price point was excellent. The staff was super welcoming and friendly and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the lack of  veggie mains on the menu deter you veggie friends: Jalapeno's knows the secret to a vegan's heart. Yes. Free Avocado.

This ain't no subway. They easily whipped up a huge (14') vegan burrito for me with avocado subbed for meat. It was loaded with beans, rice and fresh veggies. I topped it off with selections from their salsa bar to make mine perfect, and it was.

The place seems to be a mom and pop operation, with the service being so on point that only the owners could be delivering it. My only complaint is that they take a wee while to get the food out, but it's worth waiting for.

This little takeout/ fast food stop is one of my new favourites downtown."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in a long time. The beef tongue and marinate chicken was simply amazing. The guacamole was fresh and very tasty. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We went thinking this was a regular restaurant, so were a bit surprised that it is cafeteria style. Think \"Subway\" counter like, but with tortillas. Several tables for eating in or you can do take-out.

It has only been open a week, so is new and very clean. Colourful Mexican blankets cover the walls and good ol' Mexican music playing. The owner is very welcoming, friendly and helpful with the menu choices. The food is very fresh, tasty and generous sized portions. It is very authentic Mexican food and we really liked it. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"After many less than ideal lunches at Subway, I decided to try something new. This cozy tucked away resteraunt was lovely! The owners greeted me as I came in and the food was pretty good. I bought the Plato which is essentially a burrito without a bun. The Pico DE Gallo is divine! Really hit the spot. It is a little bit more expensive than some fast food places ($12 for the plato) but after many unsatisfying lunches and too many early mornings to make my food, it is a nice change. Not the best Mexican food compared to Julios but it does the trick!"}
{"text":"I ordered the adobado chicken burrito. It was a bland and soggy mess. Before I was half finished eating so much juice had dripped out of the bottom of the burrito that a pool of orange completely covered the larger oval plate it was served on. This made the bottom of the burrito completely unfold which made eating the last half a sloppy chore. The least they could have done is put extra napkins on the tables or by the sauces, but instead you have to cut to the front of the line and ask for more at the till. Besides being disappointed with the mess, the flavour was really nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 3 years since they opened and the quality is consistently amazing. Everything is prepped and made fresh and that morning. The recipes are also amazing, and they even have proper lengua! If I still lived downtown I could easily eat here twice a week. I could go on forever so just go eat there!"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  Food was good and authentic but a bit pricey.

I drove by this place a few weeks back, and noticed it had changed from the schnitzel place that was there before.  I love Mexican food so I had to try it.  My buddy and I went there for lunch, on a Thursday. Place was busy, but not too busy which was nice.  Menu is simple, much like the rest of the restaurant.  

I had the burrito which was huge and delicious!  Food had a very authentic taste to it as the staff working there were all Latino.  It's the authentic taste that separates it from comparables like Mucho Burrito and Taco Del Mar.  They use fresh ingredients that's looks to be all made in house and you can taste the difference.  They also have a self serve salsa bar so you slather your meal with as much or as little of the different salsas as you like.

The only downside is that is is more expensive than the comparable burrito joints in town, with most menu items around 12-15 bucks.  But since its local and not a franchise I don't mind
 
Overall good food!  Mmmm"}
{"text":"They have great Mexican food here... but I knock two stars off for two reasons. 1. They are insanely slow!! I came in the evening and there was one couple in front of me and they even phoned in their order so all the guy had to do was make the food. He took over 15 minutes bcs he just kept talking to the couple in front of me. You could tell the couple didn't want to talk to him and even turned to us to tell us they ordered their food on the phone so that it would be ready when they got there. And they only ordered food for themselves and nothing that special that required extra preparation. 2. And this is the biggest reason... they are never open when their hours say they're going to be. They're supposed to be open from 5pm on weekdays and we went by his last Tuesday July 14 at 5:45 but they were closed. We came by once the week before on Tuesday July 6 on our way home from work (about 5:20) but they weren't open. I have no issues w their food, it's quite tasty... but it's either closed when they should be open or it takes an unreasonably long time to get the food when it even is open. I won't bother going back. There's a nee Mexican place opening up close by (two blocks away)... hopefully they have much better service."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and have tried this place 3 times. The buritto is big but most of is rice. The owner is a very friendly guy. The food though, it my opinion nothing special. I prefer mucho burrito or shawarma around the corner. The price $12 doesn't seem to be adequate. 

Tip - stick with chicken or pork"}
{"text":"More restaurant than fast food chain, very fresh and tasty! The place looked very clean and organized the times I visited. Full recommended"}
{"text":"Delicious,  authentic Mexican Food!   So thrilled we found this little gem!   Tried the 4 taco plate with 4 different meats (marinated chicken,  chorizo sausage,  beef and pork)  ,  all equally as delicious! Everything is obviously made from scratch and very authentic!   The salsas were scrumptious!  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Face it, it's next to impossible to get great mexican/latin american food in this town. Frankly, if I came from a warm climate like that, at the first sign of winter, I'd be bolting for home. Having said that, the people who run Jalapeno are sticking it out, and thank the stars for that! Their portions are generous, their ingredients are fresh, and the service (even though it's a walk up and order kind of place) is top notch. 
If you're wondering where to start, I suggest the tostados, maybe with tinga (marinated/pulled/spicy chicken). If you're really hungry, the burrito is about 2 lbs worth of noms for a reasonable price. 
They have a simple salsa bar, with varying spice levels, and it's lovely to taste decent salsa again. 

I lived a year in southern tx. Spent my time wandering the southern US and northern Mexico. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a place that serves food that reminds me of those times."}
{"text":"I'm open to suggestions. If someone randomly stops me on my tracks to insist on me trying their favourite new joint, I wouldn't hesitate to oblige them. Especially if they're pretty and possibly rich.

In this case it was more rugged and possibly deadly. And when my buddy Harker told me about Jalepenos, I couldn't say no because he was about to rip my arm off.

\"ANGELO, You gotta try this wicked Mexican taquiera. 3 Words, Beef Tounge Tacos\"


So it sat rattling around in my mind for weeks until I happened to get a chance for a lunch hang with my friend Steph on a friday. We strolled in here and immediately we recalled our best taco experiences and began to contrast the experience here.

First off, they had a sign that said \"We do not serve \"alcohol\" here\" followed by a spanish translation.

Next their fast-food-esque service entailed having to order your food in the front. We decided on their tortilla and taco with the option to try as much meats as we wanted. My heart interjected and demanded it's weight in beef tongue, but we also went for chorizo and adobado. On top of things we tried their guacamole, and horchata.

*cracks fingers* allright here we go:

The tortillas and tacos were amazing, they held up their end of the deal and delivered the tasty fillings without any of the dodgy messes involved with poorly formed shells.

The fillings were fresh. I wasn't too picky about which veggies went where but freshness counts and I had no complaints. Their salsa bar was simplified to three sections: Mild, Medium, and RECTUM REQUIEM.

The meat. Oh the glorious meat. The Beef Tounge was so soft and as a boy raised having to eat his weight in offal, this was done WELL. So buttery and meaty. The same could be said for the adobado, but although the chorizo wasn't as standout.

Their Guac is made fresh on order, tasty but I think some people might think it too salty. I often load mine up to adjust the taste and this was just perfect.

Finally their horchata was refreshing and creamy. My friend tried it for the first time and her mind was blown away. My friend had it for the first time and forgot the point she was making mid conversation.

Jalapenos blew my mind. Despite lacking the experience in real Mexican Taquieras, save for the dodgy but deluctable street taco I has in Nuevo Vallarta, this felt like a whole new experience to me worth revisiting and worth the awkward track across the city."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mexican restaurant in Calgary. Food is fresh, prepared daily. 
Service is fast and their Management and employees are very friendly.
You will be amazed !"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food but for a price.

On my hunt for some decent Mexican food here in Calgary, I was advised to try out Jalapeno's. It was a bit of a walk from my office but I figured that it would be worth it. I ordered the taco's (4 small soft corn tortillas) with the beef tongue as my meat. I then tried all of the hot salsas available from the salsa selections, but to my dismay only the red one was actually spicy. All in all I really enjoyed the meal, but I haven't told you how much it cost me yet. To be fair the $12 price tag is not too high for a lunch downtown but when I am serving myself I generally expect something cheaper. I would happily go back to Jalapenos, especially if I was in the area but otherwise it's pretty much just a Mucho Burrito done in more of a family owned style.

Tasty beef tongue tacos but a little pricier than you may expect."}
{"text":"Being from the California area, I have an idea of what good Mexican food should be. While most so-called Mexican food in Calgary would offend me personally if I were Mexican, this pace at least makes a fairly reasonable attempt to provide something authentic. 

Here's hoping that the locals that are conditioned to the crap like they get elsewhere in this town that is passed on as Mexican don't doom this place..."}
{"text":"Great place for quick sit down or take out taco or burrito.  Had the chorizo burrito last night.  It was tasty with the hot sauce."}
{"text":"I was here again the other day and nothing has changed! Same prices and same great product. The owner gave my kid a free lollipop (after he cleared it with me first) and had her laughing when we left. Such a kind man.

He didn't even bat an eye when I asked for a side of cilantro. I love that stuff. Its my version of Franks, I put that ish on everything.

I had the beef burrito and it was massive, as always. I've included a picture just for you!

I wish they had dessert!"}
{"text":"You must know 2 things about me first:
1. I always give small, family run shops the benefit of the doubt.
2. I was pretty psyched to try this place.

But my experience at this place was not good, and since it's still fresh in my mind, I feel I'm being generous with my rating.
First, they have a very limited menu: 5 items, and one is no longer available. Also, they had a few items listed as sides which also were not available.
Second, each item is $10, and comes with nothing but the taco/tosada/burrito you ordered.
Third, they have a Salsa Bar, which normally excites me! Love salsa bars! However, this one had three stations related to heat, each one with 3 different salsas, but no little cups to put it in. So you have to open up your burrito, pour it in, and that's all you get. 
I ordered a burrito. I got so frustrated trying to pick it up I almost threw it away. I had to put it down, grrrrr, take a big breath, then try again. It was like trying to pick up soup! The butt end was running with juice from the (turns out very flavorful) spicy chicken meat. And my one allotted napkin did very little.  I now need a bath. 
For $25 for two people at a walk-up fast food restaurant, I expected a little bit more - make it a platter with rice and beans or something. 
And how is it there wasn't a single Jalapeno in the place??? Not in the salsa, in the pico de gallo, not as a topping - no where! 
That'd be like Chicken on the Way not serving chicken! 
I'm sorry, I was just terribly disappointed. Even Taco del Mar is FAR superior to this establishment. I won't be back."}
