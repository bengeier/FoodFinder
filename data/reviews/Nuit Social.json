{"text":"Amazing recommend making a reservation for the weekends great place to share food would come back anytime"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! From the food quality, to the value, to the service, we loved all of it! We sat at the back patio which was really small but super cute and intimate. The only source of light came from the string lights around the patio. 

2/3 of the menu is dedicated to build-your-own charcutarie; so of course we had to try it! Our favourites were the Lonza, Tyrol Schinkenspeck, and Bellavitano Merlot Santori. The boards came with various toasts and sauces to compliment the meat and cheeses. I wish we had tried more! It was very appetizing. 

Then came the social plates. We really were not expecting these to be filling since the prices are all $14 and under. However, the portions were bigger than expected and defintely enough to be entrees! We ordered the PEI Mussels and the Ribs. 

The mussels were good - the broth was delicious and the mussels were fat and juicy. The ribs were great too and cooked just right. I wouldn't say it fell off the bone but I was able to easily pull the meat apart with my knife and fork (no hands required!). The meat was tender and very flavorful. It also came on a bed of mac & cheese so the whole dish was really filling. 

Overall, it was a very scrumptious and we'll definitely be back again to try out other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Have been back again a few times, and each time the quality has been consistent. I noted this time that the desserts were really well done, the warm flourless chocolate cake and the parmesan cheesecake. Beautifully done."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Summerlicious, and you wouldn't find another place that gives you THAT much food for the price. It was unbelievable! Don't bother going to the fancy restaurants that give you minimal food for $45. The food was one word - AMAZING. Would definitely come back here after Summerlicious. 
The meat and cheese board - amazing. The mussels - amazing. The short ribs - amazing."}
{"text":"Nuit is a really adorable place. It's very small so it gets crowded quick and there's not much room to move around but it's part of the charm. Probably not a good place for those who get claustrophobic quickly. The meat, cheese and olive selection is wonderful, lots to choose from. The staff was very attentive and friendly, even on a busy Saturday night. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Best charcuterie in Toronto hands down, 
The staff is helpful and super friendly and the drinks are tasty as well! It's a Must try!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. When the cocktail bar my friends and I had planned on going to was way too busy we opted for Nuit Social instead. Loved the ambiance and the food selection was great. The big draw is the cocktails though. Had the best whisky sour of my life! And their original cocktails were also good. Staff was also attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for one night from LA and stumbled on Nuit walking the neighborhood.   We are spoiled back home with great restaurants and Nuit went head to head with our favorites back home. The food is top notch.  love the approach that is kind of tapas like if you want because it is designed to share varied hors d'oeuvre. The staff is terrific,  fun, knowledgeable. Friendly. Good food without condescension.  We even walked out with a pickle recipe. 

Exceptional charcuterie selection. They even managed to introduce us to a new olive from our second home Tuscany.  Try the burnt olives!  The  Locally made spicy Soprasetta was  delicious and 
Had a serious kick.  Perfect! The house made pickled green beans are so good we asked for the recipe. 

The house cocktails were creative,  we'll balanced and not over sweet.  Excellent very original home made mixes.  The  \"Blue Botanist\" goes down as one of my favorite cocktails hands down ever.

We agree with all of the other great reviews of the pork ribs.  Delicious, juicy, perfect glazed and crisped.  Blew my mind having it on on a bed of Mac N cheese.  We also had the special of the roast  quail wrapped in bacon which was spot on.

What else can I say!  Lovely people.  Creative food very well executed. Good music not turned up too loud with a cool decor.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place for a girls night out when you want to splurge for a classy wine & cheese night. Great selection of different cheeses and meats, which come laid out nicely on a fancy charcuterie board. Cool vibe with great service as well"}
{"text":"Heard great things about Nuit Social from several friends, and was not disappointed.

It wasn't very busy when we arrived (Friday night at 9pm) and we were seated right away. We sat on the back patio until it rained, which was really cute - seating for about 20 people, string lights, very intimate. We moved inside when it rained, and the staff managed to get everyone relocated in under 5 minutes - pretty impressive.

We had a customized chacuterie board and I can honestly say it was the best I've had in the city - wide variety of cheeses and meats to choose from, and the olive selection was fantastic. We chose 3 meats, 3 cheeses and 3 olives. They list the country each item comes from, and it was fun to mix and match. 

We also ordered from the Summerlicious menu, and were really impressed by the quality of the dishes given everything we heard about the charcuterie/sharing plates being the must-try items.

Only (slight) disappointment of the night was the cocktails. We had 4 drinks between the two of us, and they were all OK but nothing special (especially considering the prices). All the signature cocktails were very similar in flavor - sweet. Would get the wine next time.

The staff were knowledgeable about the menu options (both food and drink), service was quick, and the ambiance was really nice - perfect for a date or catching up with close friends. The team service ensured that we were never left waiting for our server for prolonged periods of time, but rather were looked after promptly by any staff member who was immediately available at the time."}
{"text":"A very dim and cozy spot, good ambiance and amazing food.

We ordered several plates to share, all priced very reasonably compared to other \"sharing plate\" restaurants.

What stood out the most was the pork ribs, just fabulous!"}
{"text":"Tried Nuit Social for time tonight for winterlicious.  Great place. Great ambiance! Will def be back."}
{"text":"Looked this place up on Yelp before we went... it deserves way more than 4.5 stars!! Walked in and immediately fell in love with the little place. Our server was super nice and helpful about answering questions. My friends and I ordered a bottle of Riesling, tried the venison peppercorn salami and heliodoro rosemary cheese, ate the ricotta gnocchi and the pork ribs with mac and cheese. For dessert we had the chef's special- a butterscotch caramel pudding. This was the best meal we've ever had in our lives. If you're in Toronto you have to go here!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to Queen West!  Beautifully renovated, with a clean yet cozy aesthetic.  White walls, stunning stained glass bar, dimly lit - really nice, comfortable atmosphere.  Great menu, perfect for sharing - we didn't try any of the hot items, but shared 5 of the available charcuterie options (Toronto Lonza, Spanish Chorizo Iberico, Ontario Sopressata, Austrian Speck and a Tuscan Fennel Salami) and 3 of the available cheeses (Dutch 5 year Gouda, a goat cheese from France, and a rosemary-crusted sheep's milk cheese from Spain) - everything was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented.  The accompaniments were also stellar (house made focaccia with caramelized onions, a baguette, crostini (made from, I believe, their house made focaccia), fruit compotes...) - definitely made with care and attention to detail.  We tried an amazing cider from Prince Edward County, and chatted with the owners, who were absolutely lovely and had obviously poured their blood, sweat & tears into the place.  It truly shows, in a lovely and inviting space, with excellent food.  We'll be back soon, to try the hot items from the kitchen. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, and this was the first restaurant in Toronto I tried. With 5 other members of my party, we opted to do a family style meal. 30$/person, 6 dishes. First was assorted meats, cheeses, and olives. Not everything appealed to my taste, but majority of them were good. Even the meats/cheeses/olives I didn't enjoy, I could still taste the high quality product. Next course was calamari, and it was great! Perfect, light breading, and freshness (as was the whole meal). Next up was fried frog legs. The frog legs didn't have to much breading, but the leg as a whole wasn't very tasty. Short ribs, and smoked mac n cheese was the next course. Ribs fell off the bone, but had a bit too much sauce for my liking, and for the mac it was good, just make sure you enjoy the smokey flavor. Mussels were brought out, and they were delicious! For dessert I was able to sample chocolate mousse, a lemon and marshmello fused dessert cup, and parmesan cheesecake. All the desserts were good, I would rank the desserts in the order as listed. If I lived in this neighborhood, I'd definitely check it out again. Since I'm out of town, I wouldn't come back (mainly due to the fact of how many different places there are). Cool place to try out. Servers were knowledgable, but were limited on # of servers. So, once it started getting busy, you could wait around 25-30 minutes for next course. Plus only saw one chef back there. Food was good enough to overcome time between meals"}
{"text":"We booked for a party of 6 at 6:30pm on a Saturday for my dad's birthday dinner as he asked us to take him somewhere 'new and cool' in Toronto. We picked here based on good yelp reviews.

The food is all tapas style, primarily meat and cheese boards, with a few other shareable dishes. We had a board of each with olives and shared the meatballs, kale and quinoa salad, short ribs, mussels and arancini. Most of us had the parmesan cheesecake for dessert. Everything was tasty. Good selection of cocktails, wine, beer etc. More crostini or bread would've been nice with the boards.

The decor is nice; it's a small place with character and a very cute little back patio.

Our server recommended we get 5 shareable dishes along with the boards. We got 6 as we wanted 2 orders of meatballs. Our meal for 6 was not quite $400 after tax and tip. I don't mind paying for a good meal, and maybe we just needed more food, but after all that (including dessert), I wasn't even full. 

The really unfortunate part was the service. On one of the first warm spring days we decided to sit outside on the patio. We asked our server if it got chilly if we'd be able to come inside. She said she'd keep a table for us and let us know if anyone comes in asking for it so we could decide. The service was extremely slow (20+ minutes to get a beer slow/our meal was 3 hours) and as the sun went down it got cold. Before we even got our main food we told our server we were ready to move inside and she said unfortunately someone sat themselves at one of the tables (we needed multiple tables pushed together to fit us and it's a pretty small place). She told us they were just having drinks and might leave soon and she'd let us know when we could move in. We asked another 2-3 times when she'd come out if the table was open (as by now it was late and really cold). We asked if she could see if they'd move to another table (it wasn't full) but she said no. We were polite and just made the best of it. 

Our server did apologize a few times that we couldn't go inside, but how hard is it to ask a people politely if they'd be okay moving to another open table so your cold party of 6 outside could come sit inside? Any reasonable person would be happy to move. That's just lack of common sense. At the very end of the meal, the owner of the restaurant came out with a round of cocktails on the house (an ice cold drink - just what we needed?). He apologized and said he wished he knew earlier there was a problem. A nice gesture but really, not enough to make up for it. I hate when restaurants offer you something you don't want to make up for a mess up. They should've offered to comp something we actually ordered.

Overall, pretty disappointing and I felt pretty bad for making a poor choice for my dad's birthday. This might be a nice place to go to just chill out for drinks and nibbles, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great! We got the meat and cheese boards, sweet potatoes bravas, and short rib. The service and food were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers! We came here last weekend for a birthday dinner and found this place based on Yelp reviews.

We started with 3 cheeses, 1 meat and 1 olives. It was amazing! The board came with crusty bread and some different spreads. We told them to surprise us and were not disapointed.

The mains we shared pork glazed ribs (huge portion), artichoke hearts (really yummy) and the gnocchi (star of the mains! so creamy and delicious, def. not healthy)

We tried the much raved about Parmesan Cheesecake and it lived up to the positive reviews. Delicious!

When we came (7:00pm) there was basically no one in the restaurant, but by 8:30 it was packed. We sat on the small patio out back which was cute. 

The servers were excellent! We really enjoyed our meal!!"}
{"text":"Trendy, cozy and cute! This restaurant is a great place to relax and catch up with friends or enjoy a night out with your sufficient other. From the extraordinary, bubbly, knowledgeable staff to the delicious appetizers and plates served on boards, you will be in awww. The drinks are to die for. My favourite was the Moscow Muel! This place will not disappoint but rather appoint to your next and further wine and dine."}
{"text":"I went to Nuit Social last night for summerlicious, and it was delicious! First off, I love any place where reservations are easily made online, and that my table was ready in a timely manner. The service was amazing! We sat at the window seat, which was a bit hot and uncomfortable. However, our table asked for ice for our water to help with the heat, and the ice just kept on coming! 

Now, the food! 
Fried artichoke hearts: DELICIOUS, and fragrant! The dipping sauce is a refreshing touch. 
Roasted squash and beet salad: It was good, but a bit dense for what I thought would be a refreshing, light dish. 
Pork Ribs with Mac n Cheese: The balsamic glaze on the ribs were the perfect balance between sweet and savory. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone. The mac and cheese was flavorful, and not too heavy. BEST DISH LAST NIGHT! 
Chocolate Mousse: For you chocolate lovers, I would definitely recommend this! It's more dense than your regular mousse, almost feels like a light and fluffy cake. 
Crema Catalana: light, and refreshing. It's not too sweet, for those that do not have a sweet tooth. 

I would definitely go back to have some drinks, make my own charcuterie board, get their parmesan cheesecake, and sit on their christmas-light-lit patio!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here on a date on a quiet Monday night to celebrate Valentine's Day. We were blown away by the taste and presentation of the food. Not to mention the wonderful and personable service from Jeanelle(unsure of spelling). She was very knowledgeable and welcoming. The ambience was excellent and the experience all together was top notch! Would definitely come back asap!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The service was terrific and the atmosphere was lively and fun. However, the charcuterie menu itself was very disappointing. All the meats and cheeses were ones I recognized and could easily procure myself for a fraction of the cost, from St Lawrence market or Cheese Boutique. I expected them to curate more interesting items for the gigantic markup they charge. I also expected a better wine list, to pair with all the cheeses. If I were to go back, I would stick with the hot menu. The only two hot items I tried were mac and cheese and steak, and they were both amazing."}
{"text":"Bottom line: very tasty food, great service, good drinks and cute spot.

This is definitely my favourite neighbourhood spot, and potentially my favourite restaurant in Toronto. I have been many times, so this is more of a summary review of all experiences, rather than a review of a particular outing.

Most of the menu is sharing plates and charcuterie/ cheese boards. In general the sharing plates are a lot larger than most tapas style places, so you could order one for yourself, but it's more fun to share.

The Food
They change the menu seasonally, though a lot of the items stay the same, just change up slightly. Personal favourites:
- fried artichoke hearts - I don't even like artichoke that much, but these are melt-in-your mouth good
- Mussels - always tasty with lots of flavourful broth, and a huge portion, so plan to share this unless you want a lot of mussels to yourself
- If they have them on the menu, the scallops are amazing!
- gnocchi with saffron cream is super rich, but so good
-pork ribs with mac n' cheese. This is a weird one, since I don't eat pork, but inevitably someone in my party always orders this and raves about it and I love the mac n' cheese with a bit of the soy maple glaze in it - yum!
- the cheese - you really can't go wrong with a cheese board

The Drinks:
I'm not a cocktail connoisseur, but all the cocktails I've had at Nuit have been top notch. My personal favourite is the Bara - a blackberry, cocktail with gin. It's a tiny bit sweet, but not too much and the perfect drink to sip on the cute back patio
Also a good mix of beer and wine

The Place/ Service:
- service has always been good, and they're great at recommending menu items and quantities 
- cute ambiance, I really like the multi-colour bar
- fairly small, but can fit a bigger group if you reserve (I once did 7 on my birthday)
- cute back patio
- half price social plates on Thursdays is awesome!
- reasonably priced for the quality/quantity

I recommend this place to all my friends, and look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious and I was very impressed. 

I had the House Smoked Salmon salad, which was a nice and light appetizer. My favorite dish of the night though was the Pork Ribs entree. These ribs were cooked to perfection to the point where the meat came right off and the balsamic glaze added a nice sweetness to the meat. The smoked mac and cheese just took the dish to another level. For dessert I had the Crema Catalana which was smooth and light with hints of lemon. They also bring you pieces of bread and olive oil w/ balsamic vinaigrette for dipping which was nice of them.

The only down side is that the place is small and it was very loud. They also apparently don't have AC either so it gets hot too. 

I will definitely be coming back to try their charcuterie boards!"}
{"text":"I went to Nuit Social on a Thursday during their happy hour, and it was the stellar yelp reviews which motivated me to make a reservation. There were pros and cons to this place for me: 

Pros
- Their charcuterie boards. An absolute must. Most delicious cheeses and meats with accompanying compotes. There was on apple compote in particular that tasted fantastic with everything. So good!
- Service. Our server was so nice and attentive without being overbearing.
- The mussels. Unreal broth that we finished off with the table bread. Amazing, buttery  flavour! Probably up there with the best mussels I have ever had. 
- Decor/vibe. Loved the stained glass bar! 

Cons
-Online menu. I went anticipating to have the parmesan cheesecake because everyone raves about it, and it was on their online menu at the time. However, it's only a seasonal dish, and they haven't had it all summer. Our waitress told us that the haven't changed the menu online since June (this was a night in late August). In addition, the scallops were also on their online menu, and it wasn't on the menu when I arrived. Two dishes I had been looking forward to that they were not serving. *Also, some of the happy hour info on yelp isn't correct. It's half off the social plates ONLY per alcoholic drink you purchase. 
- Pork ribs and mac&cheese. The texture and cook on the ribs was excellent (falling off the bone) but they are extremely sweet; they had a maple syrup taste. The mac&cheese had a strong smokey flavour, overpoweringly so. If you're okay with very sweet ribs and smokey mac, then this is definitely the dish for you.
- The arancini was very underwhelming. Again, the cook on them was great. Great textures which fell apart so nicely when you cut through it, but the flavour was very bland. Needed salt, basil, oregano ... anything to give them flavour. The chipolte mayo it with was nice but again, you don't want to completely drench the arancini in sauce either. 

All in all, I would definitely come back here for the wine and the charcuterie boards. I still want to try this parmesan cake that everyone talks about, as well as one of their cocktails. I would definitely call in advance though  to double check if certain items are being served that night. Great service, and great ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for delicious bites. I've been 3 times in the past 6 months and every time I go it's delicious. The food is beyond delicious, the service is on point and the atmosphere is relaxed and cozy."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant. Food was delicious and the service was outstanding!

Was there for Winterlicious and the Beef Cheeks were absolutely to die for. Tender and Flavourful   and couldn't have been prepared and presented any better. 

The restaurant is very cozy and I suggest making reservations to avoid disappointment.

I am definitely looking forward to returning and ordering from their regular menu. 

I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago for Winterlicious, great service and food! The space is really cute as well, albeit small but cute. I look forward to coming again to try the charcuterie as I've heard good things about it."}
{"text":"Nuit Social is a good  spot if you want to sit down and enjoy a glass of wine and some fancy bar snacks.
Their menu is mainly focussed on their boards. The way it works is you get to choose what meats, cheeses and olives go on your boards. The best part are the chutneys, crackers and bread that go along with them.
They also offer some sharable  dishes. I tried the octo which was a bit dissapointing so I would recommend sticking to the charcuterie.."}
{"text":"Delicious small plates with excellent service. Cute restaurant as well. Really enjoyed trying all the different types of olives!"}
{"text":"Ill be honest. I didn't expect much from this place but it was surprisingly good.
Deepfried artichokes in a fun presentation, ribs and mac n cheese done up nicely.
Mussels were good, service was great
Overall a nice lil spot"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Small and imitate place. Seats around 40 people? Lol don't quote me.  Food is quality !!!!!! Great meats and cheese. We've tried everything on the menu and love it! Every dish is done to perfection. No frills just tasty ingredients!We come back again and again. The boards are better that terroni 100%. The meats and cheese are from local and aboard. Desserts are sweet and simple. Literally cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great new place on Queen! Best octopus in the city hands down. Great wine and beer selection too. 
Our service was warm and casual and made us feel right at home and well taken care of. Looking forward to going back already :)"}
{"text":"Great dinner at Nuit Social - this is a great place for a date night, or to go with a small group of friends. The social boards are a must - make sure to get at least one cheese and one meat. The rest of the menu is well thought-out, with dishes that are not exotic, but very tasty. Also a big mention to their cocktail menu - innovative and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, it's a nice spot for a small bite and cocktails. The menu is mostly comprised of meats, cheeses and olives to \"build your own charcuterie board\" as well as a few share plates ranging in size. The gnocchi and arancini are particularly good and the menu has a few more interesting choices like frog legs. 

Cocktails are well made with a range of house cocktails as well as the classics. The wine list has good range and they offer a half bottles serving which is awesome for sharing. I also saw several good craft beers on tap although I didn't order one either time.

Ambiance is relatively cool too - smaller, dimly lit place with bar seating and a decent number of tables.

Price point felt a little high overall but I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for birthday celebration. They were very accommodating with the home-made cake I brought. They event brought it out on a plate with a candle! 

Charcuterie board was a great experience! We ordered 5 meats, 5 cheese and 5 olives. Honestly I can't remember which ones we ordered but majority of them were great. The olives not so much though - I would recommend sticking with 3 or less. 

The atmosphere was pretty causal but they dimmed the lights around 9ish and it became a perfect causal date night spot. 

Although the overall service by the restaurant was great, our server was a bit odd. He really didn't seem like he wanted to be there lol"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants I've been to in Toronto. The food was to die for, service was amazing. Everything was great from start to finish!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really cute place with great cocktails. We had the Blue Botanist (not on the menu) and the El Fuego. Both were great! We made our own charcuterie board, which we thought was the best part. The music wasn't too loud so a great spot to go if you want to have good conversation. Beware of the patio though ... I got eaten alive by mosquitos!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious-five stars for the pork ribs. RIBS RIBS RIBS. omg so good. the glaze was heaven and it just came off the bone so nice...perfectly cooked. I'd come back just for the ribs!

Fried artichoke was good too, and the peach melba was beautifully presented. Portions were surprisingly big for summerlicious; couldn't even finish my macaroni and cheese! The only downside was that the restaurant itself was very small and cramped and the tables were tiny :("}
{"text":"My wife and I made a reservation on a Friday night. It was not too busy when we arrived, but it filled up quick. It is a small place, and they do good business.
We started with an Old Fashioned, which was delicious. Very well made and you could taste the bourbon. I would prefer one large ice cube to the small ones, but it was very good.
We ordered oysters which were so delicious. That helped to whet our appetites for the charcuterie.
We decided on 3 cheeses, 3 olives and 3 meats. They were brought out to the table reasonably quickly. The olives got a little salty at the end (maybe we should have got less), but the cheeses and meats were superb. 
Atmosphere was very cozy and chic. The service was excellent and very attentive. We really enjoyed our dinner at Nuit Social."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Good date spot. Small. Intimate. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Go there for the cheese & charcuterie. As for the other plates, we tried a few; arancini were our favourite, the gnocchis had too much garlic, the pumpkin was alright but the highlight of the meal was definitely the Parmesan cheesecake. I think it's the best cheesecake ever had in my life. So if you go eat there, you don't leave without trying it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Had the charcuterie board and also cheese. Olives are superb. We shared the kale salad which was tasty and the fish of the day. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"well , im not impressed. we saw so many nice reviews and decided to give it a shot on a friday night. well it was not what i thought. we got 2 cocktails (meeh) and one of their cheese and meat plates. I found nothing that cannot be found in a grocery store. we got 3 cheeses and 3 meats and not even one tasted special or new. All from nofrills maybe. 
Staff were really nice though. 
Its a quiet place in a crowded street and I kinda felt like missing out all the Queen street kind of fun for the price of 60$. 
If you are 15 people looking for some where quiet to have a social night It might be a good choice. 
but Im really disappointed."}
{"text":"The summerlicious menu was good! My husband and I thought the best choices were the fried artichoke (appetizer), the pork jowl (main), and the chocolate mousse. We also had the game meatballs, fish main, and the panna cotta, which we didn't think were nearly as good as the first set of dishes I listed. However, it was about $74 (after tax and tip) for two people."}
{"text":"I loved their arancini balls because they had porcini mushrooms and cake with an Alfredo type sauce instead of tomato which gave a nice spin to a classic dish. 

We had three different cheeses and three meats. I also liked their olives.

We had their dessert of the day which was a lemon curd with toasted marshmallow fluff. 

Their caparinhas cocktail was the worst caprinhas I ever had, super sour and not sweet. Waitress said usually they don't have sugar which is a like uhhhh you muddle sugar in the bottom lady!! But she gave us simple syrup but it still tasted bad. I liked that it had a paper straw though. 

Waitress was nice but kept reminding us we had to be out by 8pm which I knew, they were slow bringing my birthday dessert after he table was cleaned, which my friends ordered in advance so we would've been out earlier than 7:50pm if they rushed the food as much as they rushed the humans ha.

Overall I'm not sure if I would be back again because it was out of the way, too west end for me, but the food was good. I wouldn't order flat iron steak nor artichokes again but arancini and patatas bravas was good."}
{"text":"I feel bad for writing this review as I feel that it may have just been an off night, and I have only ever been here once. It was also a summerlicious menu as well, so that could have been it as well.

Service was nice and friendly. When we sat, we were given a dirty fork with crusted food on it, and they were quick to replace it which was awesome.

The food was very plain, sloppy, and was pretty boring. There didn't seem to be much attention or thought given to the food, and we didn't really enjoy anything that we ate.

Overall, we would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has over 4 stars... my expectations were definitely high when I went to this place and unfortunately was disappointed. By all means, the service was great and the food was good, but not really worth the price or all
The stars it has. G
Cute place to grab a drink and have snacks, wouldn't go there for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is lovely! Has such a chique look to it and kind of a euro vibe. Inside iT looks very clean, and modern. The owner is lovely, he welcome us and we had a nice Long convo about the neighbourhood, products and recommendations. It was a very relaxing evening. They also offer a variety of mixed drinks you can enjoy of they back patio which looks lovely for when the weathers right. I'm definitely going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Wow! Being able to choose your own charcuterie is awesome!!!!! Open until 12am to boot! Amazing! I am butterscotch obsessed and the butterscotch pudding was like tasting a real strawberry after years of fake strawberry!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Nuit Social: if you don't live in the neighborhood, if you don't have your ear to the ground or 'your fork to the plate' as it were, you would never know this place existed. They don't do much to expose themselves on social media like many of the hip and trendy restaurants in the city now a days, but in the likely event you stumble upon this hidden gem on Queen West, you'll wonder why you hadn't known about them sooner. Lucky for me, I can see them from my window.
Unlike the many on Queen West, this narrow yet spacious resto sports a simplistic yet elegant design offering the right amount of visual pop that's easy on the eyes. To compliment the casual design, the staff, who seemingly accommodate like acquaintances more than workers offer friendly and honest service from start to beyond your finish. 
A generous selection of local and privately imported meats, cheeses and olives allow for custom charcuterie experiences unique to your group and the beer, cocktail and wine selections make welcome pairings for social gatherings whether you're celebrating in a large group or just catching up with a friend.
The share platters can substitute as dinner plates (IMO) and I can pretty much guarantee you'll never have a less than perfect experience, eating at Nuit Social. If you're into fish, I more than highly recommend the Market Priced Daily Catch as it's always changing (OBV). The dish, with sustainable fish that is intended for two can easily make for a send-you-to-bed single dinner (From experience, HA).
It's tiny, intimate places like Nuit Social that accomplish near perfection; not to say that any of the other neighboring restaurants are unable to accomplish such a feat, but, there is just something to be said about the passion that drives this team. Indeed, the comments are true that Nuit is a gem, hidden in plain sight on the sometimes overly-trendy #hashtag ridden Queen West strip, but if you can find the time to put your phone away for an hour or two, make your way over with a few of your friends to Nuit and get Social. Sans media. IRL. WRF. (with real food)"}
{"text":"Nuit Social is an absolute gem for all those social nights. The small restaurant looks ordinary on the exterior and can be easily missed walking by. However when you walk inside, the modern style mixed with a touch wooden cabin design welcomes you at first sight. The ambience was cozy and quiet enough to carry on a conversation without yelling across the table. 

This place is usually fully booked, but my boyfriend and I was lucky to catch a open time slot. We were greeted very friendly to our table and our drinks were quickly served while giving us time to analyze the menu. We decided to start off with a double meat charcuterie board and for our mains, we chose the balsamic glazed  pork ribs mac and cheese.

Double cheese charcuterie: The board had Prociutto and Bresaola paired with Vermeer cheese.   The vermeer cheese paired particular well with the bresaola cured meat. I like how it came with olives and two different of jam, butter, and bread. 

Balsamic glazed pork ribs mac and cheese: This was the best mac and cheese. It is two type of comfort food coming together in one bowl!!! The balsamic glazed soy pork ribs tasted similar to  teriyaki sauce but much sweeter due to the honey glazed. The pork ribs were very tender and it literally fell off the bones. The mac was covered in melted cheese and was not too heavy in taste, which when mixed with the balsamic soy glazed sauce, it had a sweet & salty taste. Definitely a double action comfort food that goes well with your favourite beer and a excellent choice for those friday night social nights. 

The waiters were very attentive and has depth knowledge of the menu. They were very friendly and has great smile, which made the whole dining service pleasantful"}
{"text":"If you want to reward yourself and/or your loved ones with exceptional food, wine and beer,  but weren't planning on it and aren't dressed for pretentious social dining try this place. Nuit Social has become my new place to cocoon after a long day of work. The staff are gracious and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairing. The drinks are competitively priced and they seem to have rotating specials for olives, cheeses and meats."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday night and the food and drinks were definitely a hit. Initially, we were seated inside the restaurant, but given the beautiful weather, we requested for the patio. The patio was situated at the back of the restaurant and was small and cozy. We both love charcuterie boards and were quite happy with the selections available. The salami was fantastic with the right amount of salt and fattiness. The smoked prosciutto was flavorful and the apple butter was simply delicious. Overall, we found the charcuterie board to be good value at $17 with a choice of 5 meats ($1 surcharge for the bresola - personally, we preferred the other selections). We also tried an Italian olive, which was meaty and not salty. For the small plates, we ordered the arancini, octopus and kale salad. Of the 3 dishes, I enjoyed the octopus the most. It was very tender and the tomato sauce was tasty. The arancini was a bit flat flavour wise, but it was still a decent dish. And the Parmesan cheesecake at the end was to die for. It was decadent and had the right amount of sweetness. With good food and service, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Amazing oysters, cheese, and charcuterie! Really cute patio too!"}
{"text":"Nuit Social is one of my favourite spots to go for oysters. They offer buck-a-shuck specials on Wednesdays after 5 with the purchase of a drink (and let's be honest we all want a drink anyways). Their oysters are actually great quality and their service is exceptional. My glass was not empty once, all my groups silverware and plates were replaced promptly once we were finished and ready for our next dish! I give this place five stars. Would be a great place for a romantic date night."}
{"text":"Woah! Totally loved it.

This is a place not for every palate. The recipes here are for those that really have passion for food and are capable to distinguish different flavors in each bite they have.

The service is very attentive, cordial and knowledgeable and capable to guide you with what your guts feel to have at the moment.

The type of food serve I would consider it a sort of a fusion of Italian, French and Mediterranean.
The concept is very simple: you build your own wooden tray based on how famished you are.
You have three different type of items you will have to chose from: cold cut (salumi), cheese (formaggi) and olives. Now, you can choose how many different variety you want to add to your cut board: from one to three.
But if you don't want to get a wooden tray, you can always chose only one item or skip directly to the signature dishes cooked for you by Chef John Rosal.
If I'm not wrong the meats carefully chosen and brought in from Ontario and Europe.

Since it was late, I didn't feel to have a meat so I chose three light dishes that literally blew my mind. Tino (the owner) and Chef Rosal carefully chosen and paired different ingredients that once combined together, will give you an explosion of flavors once reached your taste buds. 
We had in the following sequence: 
- for appetizer: a taste of \"olive di Cerignola\" - Cerignol (olives from, indeed, Cerignola located in the region of Puglia, Italy)
- as main course: P.E.I Mussels steamed in white wine, with butter and poached leeks and a plate of Scallops on a bed of chestnuts squash, pancetta and brussels sprouts;
- as side dish: Roasted Broccoli & Cauliflower accompanied by garlic bread crumbs, pine nuts and pecorino cheese.

Needless to say that each of these plates was awesomely designed and cooked to perfection. The flavors never were too soft or too strong neither were overpowering each other.
A superb use of simple ingredients that once combined with each other, generated a crescendo that ended in one indescribable experience. 

But here's the icing on the cake or, like we always say in Italy.... the cherry on the cake: the DESSERT.

A mastermind cheesecake that would turn any Christian into a bad boy: the Parmesan Cheesecake.
This is a slice of heaven entering your mouth, erasing completely any memory of previous cheesecake you ever had. A ridiculous dessert created and made with the best cheese Tino can possible hold on to completed with balsamic glazed strawberries and Oreo cookie crumb.

Overall the food is superb and offered to the clientele at a very reasonable price.
The drink, even though I haven't had any, are wisely chosen but, ouch, have to admit, quite pricey.

The whole meal literally surpassed my expectation.
The way food here is conceived is like having an orchestra made by so many different instruments that thanks to a great conductor, play a superlative symphony that your ears can ever ear.

This is a place that worth a visit and your money. Located in an area that is crowed with \"fast food\" such as pizza and poutine, this gem is a great place to have some serious food until late at night. Yes, you heard me. Because while other restaurants close the kitchen around 10, Nuit Social keeps cooking for you until midnight. 

...e buon appetito a tutti quanti! (enjoy your meal)"}
{"text":"Finally checked out this spot recently and I can't wait to go back already. It was that good. Great spot for tapas and amazing cocktails in a laid-back yet trendy atmosphere of Queen West. The service was really great and the plates are perfect to share. We made a reservation, however it is not mandatory. 

I would highly recommend the social boards, especially the five-meat board. It was refreshing to see they didn't skimp out on the quantity of meats and the accompaniments/accouterments were just as perfect. The quality was obviously there. The Heliodoro Rosemary sheep cheese was also excellent. I liked the cheeky presentation of the crispy calamari and that they were actually crispy yet not oily. For a healthier option, try the roasted squash and beet salad. Although inventive in presentation, the flavors were very predictable but the portion was quite sizable. Good coffee to end a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I was here on a sultry Saturday lady date and we were treated like queens.

The overall service was outstanding and bumped my 4 star rating up to a five. I'm not surprised by the other high ratings on Yelp.

There are lots of cocktail food classics; this isn't an overly ambitious or experimental menu. It's not horribly boring either. The concept is design your own snack board, share some plates and sip your drinks by the glowing stained glass bar. It works well. 

We tried a bit of everything from the menu categories: olives, meats, cheese, sharing plates, drinks and sweets. 

What I appreciated most were the delightful details:

+the lotus chips and persimmon jam with our aged gouda
+the salty puttanesca dipping sauce with the fried artichokes
+my fresh and classic Moscow Mule served in a copper cup and all (plus pretty straw)
+textures, taste and presentation of the sensual scallops 
+exquisitely presented parmesan cheesecake on a decorated cheeseboard. Artful fruit garnishes that even included gooseberries

Tip: There are 1/2 off Mondays (item changes every week) and 1/2 off social plates from 5-7 every night."}
{"text":"Went there last night, great food and great service. Would absolutely recommend. Everything was yummy! some definite must haves. The meal we had was pretty filling. 
A dinner for two we had:

Parmesan cheesecake: as all the other reviews mention,  this is a MUST HAVE. it's simply delicious. It's light, fluffy, cheesy, and just the right creaminess. The Oreo cookie crumble and strawberries were the icing on the cake. A very light hint of Parmesan that made it over the top. Should've ordered two.. 

Octopus gnocchi: also another home run. Super tender pieces of Octopus flooded the plate with little fluffy pillows of house made gnocchi. Covered in marinara sauce and fresh basil

Arancini: delicious. Just the right combination of rice, sausage and gooey cheese. Also surprisingly light! Dipping sauce was a yummy cream sauce. Order this! Comes with 4 palm-sized balls

Pork ribs: ribs were good and crispy, and paired very well with the Mac and cheese underneath. One of the larger portioned dishes. 

Artichoke hearts: these were good. Texture was on point and flavour was delicate. Marinara sauce accompanied for Dipping."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Shared a board with my husband along with two social plates that were half off between 5-7. We really enjoyed it and hope to be back."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little place, maybe seating for just over 30 people. 
There is no material for absorbing noise, so when it is relatively full the ambient noise is extremely loud. You have to lean across the table to hear what somebody opposite you is saying.

It has an unusual menu structure, of Tapa like dishes divided into meat, cheese, and olives for one, three or five portions:  And then more substantial \"plates\". On this occasion we stayed with \"plates\".

The octopus came in a small bowl and it was soft with a very Spanish taste with lots of garlic, warm small potatoes and a pleasant slightly spicy sauce. The calamari were thinly sliced with a spicy outside and correctly cooked. The gnocchi came in a creamy sauce, were tender and again lots of garlic. The shrimp were very well presented and had a deep taste were on a bed of potato, peas, lardon and was laced with spice. The Cornish hen had crispy skin again spicy, was rich, worthwhile, hot and tasty.The lemon curd desert, came in a tiny tumbler, was rich, sharp and cool.

On this occasion the three servers, which is quite enough for such a small room, seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves than actually attending to their guests. When we arrived, there was only one other table, even so one had to get up to actually attract the attention of one of the three. As the place filled up, so the service became even slower.

The wine list is short, we had a reasonable Rioja for $55."}
{"text":"Their social plates are amazing! Shared the steak and the octopus with a friend, along with a DIY charcuterie board. The steak was amazingly tender and flavourful - shout out to the garlic butter roasted brussels sprouts, they were delectable! Never knew octopus (cooked sous-vide here) could be so tender - my friend thought it might have been melted cheese! Will definitely be coming back to try some of their other social plates!!!"}
{"text":"We saw the reviews and had to try.  We shared around 6-7 dishes and everything was yummy.  Short ribs and gnocchi were highlights, but the we finished it off with chocolate mousse and the cheese cake which was so good.  The small back patio is a gem."}
{"text":"Tess's cocktails at Nuit Social are amazing with all fresh ingredients and fresh juices & cordials made in-house, paired with high quality spirits!  My wife and I went there for her birthday, and Tess and staff were kind and generous!  My wife had the Mojito made with El Dorado 12 year dark rum while I had the greyhound made with Ketel One vodka."}
{"text":"WOW!  I have never had maple soy glazed pork ribs that were so tender and delicious before!  They were seriously jaw-droppingly delicious!  It was so tender that Sindy could literally pulled off the meat from the rib bone for two of the pork ribs and did so.  It was perfectly done!  The smoked macaroni and cheese actually didn't taste too smokey to me, but it was a really well done combination of food for one dish.  I loved this! :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous date night restaurant! The menu is easy with lots to choose from and the staff is extremely knowledgeable and super friendly. We sat at the bar and Tess who served us behind the bar was awesome! They have a great wine selection that pairs with most of the food very well. I highly recommend this place for a first date or to try something new with friends. You leave feeling satisfied and not overly full. 

Tip: Try the Parmesan Cheesecake! It's delicious :)"}
{"text":"Our first place to eat in Toronto! We came here for early dinner, so the crowd was minimal. Service was great, the atmosphere was comfortable and clean. Really delicious food, can't complain about anything. I recommend getting the Pork Ribs(comes with a bed of Mac n Cheese!) and Flat Iron steak."}
{"text":"What a great time last night at Nuit Social. We were a party of 8 and went with \"chef's choice\" menu which was perfect for our larger group and very generous. Absolutely loved the charcuterie plates, well chosen and served. Our favourite was Tyrol Schinkenspeck
 The fire olives were a highlight. For mains....don' miss the pork belly...it's perfection. Same for the brussel sprouts, steak and macaroni and cheese. Ribs ... fabulous. The only lower point was the dessert, I would skip next time. Favourite cocktail was the Blue Botanist....amazingly balanced flavours and textures...yum."}
{"text":"Being brand spanking new I have only good things to say about Nuit Social.
(Maybe besides the scallops were a little too salty and they dont yet have bar coat hooks?)
The build your own charcuterie is fun and accommodating to picky dining companions and makes me feel like i DIYed something- if you like that feeling.
Service is nice, bathrooms are clean cocktails are yummy"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great location. 

I'm up for a change every once in a while. This place provides just that with all upside surprises. 

The ribs and mussels are absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I want to say 4.5 stars not 5. The patio was romantic, charming and comfortable.  The choices of smoked meats were delightful, the cheese choices were nicely varied and were served in a lovely display. Great breads and crackers, unique and diverse. Shared two social plates, fried artichokes (insanely and perfectly seasoned and spiced) and the smoked salmon (fought over the last bites of this gently smoked fresh salmon and lightest of all the creme sauces) the service was impeccable, no lingering but very present. My one and only criticism is the drink. The glass of wine was nearly vinegar, which is fine, that's what you get when you order by the glass. But the tequila and the rum cocktails I had, they just did not land. Maybe the bartender isn't a drinker? Because these were just far too overdone. I couldn't pick out the subtle flavours of the ingredients that a masterfully created cocktail allows. They were muddy. I highly recommend this place for a romantic date or conversations with a friend or two over sharing plates that deliver on many levels. Excellent ambiance."}
{"text":"Had a random craving for fried calamari one weekend afternoon while strolling around Queen West and decided to stop by here based on Yelp reviews (good thing it was right there, I was getting hangry...) 

It was delicious! SO was relieved that the calamari was up to the snuff. We also got the pork ribs + mac n' cheese, and it was freakin' delicious - not fancy-shmancy with dollops of foam, but certainly not sloppily made either, and very comforting. Smoked cheese, sticky maple ribs... just what you'd like in a good mac n' cheese. We sat on the patio at the back and had friendly and attentive service.

Will definitely return to try the charcuterie boards."}
{"text":"I really like the simplicity and social aspect of this restaurant. The menu fits well in accommodating my dietary needs (vegetarian and gluten free). The social boards are lovely and the atmosphere was very intimate with groups of people eating and talking together. The only tease I gave this restaurant a 4 over a 5 star was because the service was a bit slow, but I recognize that this was not their fault, they were short in the kitchen. Additionally, their drink menu is a bit on the expensive side; however, I will acknowledge that the bar server made a killer negroni! I definitely got a buzz off of one so give or take I guess :)"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this place was so good! We tried five different social plates (sweet potato bravas, calamari, gnocchi, arancini, ribs) and they were all seasoned perfectly. They had a deal where for $30 per person, you got a selection of five cheeses, five meats, five olives, five social plates and two desserts and man, it was worth it. The only reason I'm only giving four stars and not five is because I wasn't quite as big of a fan of the desserts. We got the cheesecake and this butterscotch dish that were a bit cheesier than I would like- the other people at my table did enjoy them so that's more of my personal preference than the quality of the food.

I should also note that the staff were super friendly and attentive. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Very cool tapas style restaurant.   Reasonable prices for the quality of food.   Nice intimate atmosphere.   Will be back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing cocktails. Tess is the premiere mixologist (please pardon my spelling) in all of Toronto, to the point I can no longer order my favorite drink (an old fashioned) at any bar/restaurant because no one does is as good as her. Her methodical infusion of ingredients leads to the most stupendous cocktails I've ever tasted in my nearly two decades of alcohol consumption, and don't even get me started on the food...

I constantly and consistently recommend this establishment to everyone I know, and those I don't,  because they make dining, and drinking, an incredible experience. 

It's an intimate and personal dining experience, but I recommend making a reservation in advance of your visit because it is a relatively small establishment (which only leads to a better and more personal evening, if I may say so myself)"}
{"text":"$100 plus tip for 3 smidgen (less than 5g) each of charcuterie, cheese, and olives, one 2tbsp dessert, 3 beer, 1 wine, and a soda water. How very Toronto. Everything was good, but teeny tiny. All but 2 of the charcuterie is pork, all but 3 of the cheeses bovine, no raw milk selections, almost nothing local. Most pleasant interior, lighting quite subdued for reading the menu, though. A bit embarrassing to whip out the phone torch to order.  Pleasant and prompt service. Wouldn't go except for a pre-show meetup. Certainly understand the popularity, just not my kind of thing."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a while. The wait staff is slow and snobby. When my entree arrived I ordered a glass of wine. The waitress disappeared for 15 minutes!!! 
By the time she came back, my food was obviously finished. Eating a nice dinner without a glass of wine is ridiculous. And she didn't even apologize. 
There was also a group of drunk women that seemed to get all the booze they wanted. They were loud and disturbing the other tables, and the staff didn't even ask them to quiet down. 
Winterlicious menu was mediocre. They don't even have their regular menu. Go somewhere else. 
This is the last time I'll eat here."}
{"text":"Interesting little place. Concept is great: great cocktails and great small plates food in casual atmosphere. Execution: almost, but does not quite pull off concept. 

Atmosphere. Tight, tiny, hipster kind of place. Low end furnishings. Very minimalistic. Looks like buildout was done on a tiny budget. 

Food. Everything we ordered was very very good. 

Service. Servers were all very friendly and efficient. Kitchen struggled expediting. Olives came immediately.  Charcuterie took 45 minutes to arrive. Server was very apologetic. Then we got slammed with rest of food all at once. Saw server in kitchen trying to help expedite. All this place needs to do is figure out how to expedite and it will be great. 

Despite timing of food, I would go back. Worthwhile."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant two times now and have had a great experience on both occasions. Servers are very friendly and helpful- recommending wines and dishes.

The charcuterie board was fabulous. Portion sizes were fair, it changes often and the food is high quality.

I love love the arancini. They are so melty and cheesy. I also tried the fried artichoke hearts that were amazing & truffle meatballs.

Also: don't skip dessert. The Parmesan cheesecake is totally unreal if you don't have a huge sweet tooth."}
{"text":"After a top notch Summerlicious visit last year, I have been looking forward to returning. Imagine my excitement when I found out that the Ribs & Mac n Cheese that impressed me so much were actually moved on to their full time menu! But let me be clear, it is not just that one item that impressed me so much to keep it's 5 star rating.

This time I got to sample the Social Boards which are basically make your own charcuterie, but then we also ordered a special app of Bonemarrow Fondue. Holy smokes, was this ever good. It was rich but balanced by the cheesey goodness, and a full on flavour explosion when I combined it with a piece of prosciutto from the Social Board. I can't even begin to explain how good this all was, so I won't try to. But man, I'm still salivating thinking about it.
We also threw down a couple social plates including the previously mentioned ribs as well as a beet salad which all rounded out the meal beautifully. 

Service was on point, beer taps are a tasty 3 options of Ontario craft brewed goodness, and they take reservations as well. I can't think of anything I'd want them to change here. And am going to make for damn sure I don't wait another 6 months between returning, after all patio season is only a couple months away!"}
{"text":"After eating at Dandylion - we were looking for a place to have a few drinks and came across Nuit Social.  We managed to get a table right away (which in retrospect seems a bit of a miracle).  Cocktail menu was the perfect size and had quite a few interesting signature drinks.  We had to wait quite a while for our first drink as they were slammed at the bar, but the service was friendly and the cocktails were worth the wait.

Between the two of us, we tried at least 5 different drinks and every one was fantastic.  The signature drinks are highly recommended - I tried Zucca: a chai pumpkin spice based drink as well as Bara: a Dillon's rose gin and raspberry concoction (that night as they ran out of blackberries).  I loved Bara so much i had it twice.  Delicate flavours in both of the drinks - and hidden depth.  Definitely on the sweeter side, but that's how I roll.  My husband tested out some of the boozier drinks - a manhattan, old fashioned and mint julep - all were good quality classics.

Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Am I that loser who lives in a small town and then writes 5 star reviews for every trendy Toronto spot? Maybe. Eek. But still. Wow.

Social Nuit is buried on Queen Street West right near my old haunt: The Drake Hotel. Haven't been there in awhile, but still love the neighborhood. You'll walk right past it the first time. The storefront is so freaking unassuming. Look for the \"Nuit\" script in the window.

Make reservations. It's tiny. A front dining area, a small bar with bar dining, and a tiny back dining room (the best place for a more quiet dinner).

There are share plates and then charcuterie. I chose the place because, unlike most restaurants on Valentine's Day, they didn't have a stupid prix fixe menu. I hate those overpriced prix fixe bullshit menus with their $100pp multi-course fiesta that always turns into poor quality and sloppy. What Social Nuit had instead was a $70 per couple (per couple! sweet!) deal where you could choose 5 items from the meat/cheese/olive menu, 3 share plates and 2 desserts. Just my kind of place.

We chose a hard goat cheese, a soft blue cheese, and a creamy French cheese. Beautifully presented along with prosciutto and salami. A little crostini, sweet jams, spicy mustards, tart pickles. Perfect. 

For the three shares, we had the arancini, pork ribs (served over mac n cheese), and beet salad. All were amazing. Arancini was deliciously light and flash-fried with delicious sausage lining the center. The pork ribs lived up to the other reviews. Fall off the bone and barbecued similar to Korean BBQ. The combo with the mac and cheese was great. And the beet salad wasn't too cold or too sweet (my pet peeves with beets). Sweet potato complemented this salad nicely. 

We added on half a lobster tail. It was good, not great. Slightly overcooked, maybe a little overpriced. It mattered little in the grand scheme of things. 

Dessert -- get the parmesan cheesecake. It was far better than the dessert special, which was an apple custard. The parmesan lends a savory edge to the cheesecake, which is unusually wonderful. Just a small piece, very rich, not very sweet, a perfect finisher. 

Our drinks were also spectacular. I had something that was perfect for a cold winter's night -- bourbon with smoked rosemary. Loved it. 

I'm going back to Nuit Social. It was the perfect mix of spirited, aesthetic, romantic, whimsical, tasty, fun and easy on the wallet. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Selected this restaurant for my sister in law's birthday dinner, and a plus was that Winterlicious was on ^_^

We were seated and offered drinks and brought water. The place isn't big, but very cosy and the tables aren't super close together. Would love to sit at the front window table for 4 next time, very nice atmosphere. 

We all selected our courses and meat board. We drooled a bit watching the table next to us devour their meat board and fresh bread with olive oil. Our board came and after waiting another 10 minutes we had to ask for bread, which was worth the wait btw.

We basically ordered to share, we got:

Chest nut soup (taste like a seafood bisque) which was delicious, light and flavorful.

The beet salad which wasn't my favorite but there was a lotus root chip YAY on top.

The fried artichoke hearts, the smaller pieces were crispy and delicious with the sauce, but the larger ones became a bit soggy.

The salmon was moist, lightly seasoned and along with the beans and rapini under was a perfect combo.

The beef cheeks and mash potatoes were so good! Albeit a bit heavy but good thing the portion wasn't huge. It was perfect to share both of those dishes to balance each other out,

The creme caramel and chocolate mousse were both delicious and the presentation was very pretty. 

Took a bit of time to ask for the bill, but otherwise everything else went well! 

They had Beau's and Flying Monkey on draft :)"}
{"text":"Minimalist decor, killing it on the charcuterie board, good drinks, and tasty food. What we got: good wines, this drink called the Barra (so good, tasted like a hint of saffron, not super sweet, but bitter), octopus gnocchi (totally delicious and very filling), squash salad (creamy mint sauce dressing, could have ordered that alone as a drink), charcuterie board (perfect appetizer with all kinds of DIY options to make it), and the lamb shank (very filling). We went on a super cold night and the outside window had this nice, ambient, sorta-porno'ish steam over it (the porno steam wasn't all that nice but it's all good, felt like a neat exterior sign).  But -- and my grade 12 chemistry may be off -- it was also not super well ventilated and the delicious food smells kind of came home with us. Lamb shank came home with me, and my scarf, and I think my hair if I had more of it (love you bald head).  All good. Not the fault of the resto at all.  Love this place, will be back, amazing wait staff and the unassuming'ness was like totally Toronto hipster style. Great spot."}
{"text":"This place is really really good.  I live in the area and have been twice in 1 month.  Social boards are delectable.  Service was courteous and pleasant. Decor is subtle yet stylish.  I went meaty with tasty arancinis to go along with the meatballs and short ribs. The roasted Broc and Cauli was very good as well.  I would recommend this resto to anyone."}
{"text":"Nuit Social is a really cute, chill lounge where you can grab some wine and have your way through a wide selections of locally sourced meats and cheeses. It is the place to go to if you feel like adulting for the night.

My experience at Nuit Social was very pleasant. I came in to celebrate my best friend's birthday and we were not disappointed. We thoroughly enjoyed the meats, olives and cheese that we chose for our charcuterie board. The cheese that we chose was the Vermeer. It was light and delicate in taste which was perfect for us, considering how we are not fans of strong cheeses. We also enjoyed the smoky flavours of the Fire olives. As for other dishes, we ordered the risotto gnocchi and crispy calamari. We loved the risotto gnocchi - it was perfectly deep fried and was quite filling. As for the crispy calamari, I would say that it is the best fried calamari that I've had so far, hands down. The crispy calamari was more generous that we expected. It had a nice lightly deep fried texture on the outside and was a soft and flavourful on the inside. For me, the one thing that makes or breaks calamari is whether or not it is the perfect texture (i.e. not rubbery) and the calamari that I had was perfection. 

Service was friendly and attentive. The food came out really fast and I appreciate the fact that the servers whisked away your dish relatively quickly and replace it with a new dish almost immediately. 

Overall, Nuit Social is a great place for catch ups and dates. If you are not into loud, crowded bars, Nuit Social is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Nuit Social is your typical hidden neighbourhood gem perfect for small gatherings or date nights. The space is decorated with coloured glass and old style school chairs giving it a warm and inviting vibe. 

We tried a combination of five cheese and 3 meat with a bottle of riesling. The charcuterie plate was nicely presented on a wood plank and came with an assortment of jams and apple butter, it was definitely the type of presentation you would want to instagram and snapchat. 

We also tried the ribs mac and cheese (sweet ribs with creamy and delectable mac and cheese) and the arancini balls (a gooey ball filled with mushroom, rice and cheese). 

I would say that Nuit social is a place to enjoy each others company while munching on snacks rather than to have a full on feast."}
{"text":"Love the food, service and ambiance!

Came here tonight with two girlfriends and had a great time on their back patio. It is small with strings of lights to create a romantic ambiance. Our server was as cute as he was attentive. Tried all the items on the summerlicious menu and I highly recommend the Fried artichokes, Mushroom Gnocchi and Mussels.

The Tom Collins was also a perfect way to top off the meal. 

I'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Service is great - really friendly staff. Food is passable. Flat Iron Steak is executed well and just under $20 Maybe the charcuterie board is worth a try if you like to pick and choose the components."}
{"text":"We continue our weekly exploration of affordable dinning in Toronto. I've yet to match my partners choices and this was no exception. 

An interesting experience with a very friendly staff. A little disappointed that having made a reservation we were seated at a tall table where there was a cold breeze that detracted from the meal. We ordered a cheese and meat board which were very minimalistic. I mean tiny bits of cheese the meat was a little more generous. Then we had the calamari and squid thinking it would be more substantial, not so. With two cocktails the bill was around 80.00 considering the amount of food it's pretty pricey. 

A place to go if all you want is a snack or you arrive already fed. The best part was the service."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Even though we didn't have a reservation, three friends and I walked in for dinner on a Saturday night and the owner accommodated us perfectly at the bar. 

We ordered a glass of wine each, and then a plate of three cheeses and prosciutto. Off of a friend's recommendation, I ordered the pork ribs with Mac and cheese and boy was it good. The arancini balls were amazing as well.

Would recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"It was an interesting restaurant but expensive. The menu was a bit confusing and would have been nice if our waiter explained it. We ended up not ordering even close to enough food. It was good, but wouldn't go back probably."}
{"text":"Prior to Tilt, a small group of us came to Nuit Social on Queen West close to the Drake.  Nuit Social focuses on European inspired dishes, tapas, mains and drinks....my kind of place!  If you're looking for a perfect spot, that's ideal for a date or just chill out, this is your place.
as for shareable(s) we order an assortment board of:
Prosciutto, Chorizo, French salami, Fire olives (smoked) with three types of cheese (forgot the names)
As for mains, we did the same and shared the following:
*Arancini stuffed with mushroom/ alfredo creme sauce. 
*Yam potato bravas with a lovely sauce to unify the flavors.
*Flat iron steak with chimichurri sauce, I found the sauce not as flavorful as the one I had in Buenos Aires.
*Artichoke, no matter what still a fav for me.
Overall the service was attentive and courteous. 
However for Caparinhas, it was the worst I've had, it was not sweet.  Sorry but I've been to South and Central America and it being one of my favorite drinks I think I know how it should taste lol. 

Would I come back, perhaps, If I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Dropped in for summerlicious, appetizers were almost inedible due to how salty they were (fried artichokes, salmon)d. The mussels were good but the Gnocchi, while tasty, was a fairly small portion. The catalana was far too sweet, and neither of us finished it.

I'm sure their normal menu is better than this, but for summerlicious it was pretty bad."}
{"text":"This review is for the Winterlicious menu. I came here in February 2016 and my first thought was that the restaurant was TINY - there are very few tables and it is very cramped. Between the two of us, we were able to sample a lot of the Winterlicious menu:

Bread to start (complimentary) - Nothing special, thin pieces of baguette dipped in olive oil
Chestnut soup - Really flavourful and delicious, no complaints here
Squash and Beet salad - Tiny portion with tiny pieces of squash and beet! It seemed more like it was meant for a tiny baby with a tiny mouth and tiny teeth. Such a sad excuse for a salad even though the flavour was okay.

Squash Potato Gnocchi - the gnocchi had good pillow-y texture but I found this dish way too salty. Would not order again.
Beef Cheeks - really good, fall-off-the-bone meat with delicious potato puree and sauce.

Chocolate Mousse - This dessert was delicious but I do think it's difficult to ruin a chocolate mousse. The serving size was very reasonable and the flavour was rich and decadent.
Creme Caramel - The salted caramel topping was delicious, but the \"creme\" part just tasted like flavourless cream. Nothing special. 

Drinks - I had the Bara drink, which is a combination of gin, sake, pink peppercorn, blackberries and rhubarb bitters. I really think the restaurant needs to rethink this cocktail because it honestly looked like dirty water! It was brown and opaque with several fibers floating around in it. The taste was okay but the presentation was off-putting. 

In conclusion, I definitely would not recommend Winterlicious at this restaurant unless you only order the chestnut soup, beef cheeks, and chocolate mousse. Based on reviews I think it would probably be a lot better if you ordered off the a la carte menu, which is not an option during winterlicious (except cheese/salami boards)."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places we've eaten in a long time!! Food was to die for! Loved the delicious appetizers (social boards). Duck and ribs were amazing!! The chocolate mousse was also to die for!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. I moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and have eaten here twice. The pork ribs on Mac & cheese is the best comfort food ever. Cozy and the service is great. Can't recommend the place enough."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

Decided to check this place out for my birthday and made reservations.  Located on Queen W this is on the smaller scale for restaurants but they certainly pack it in.  It's loud and vibrant in here so if you are looking for a first date place I probably would not suggest this.  Also if you care to hear your dining companions sitting across from you and not scream at them, well this probably isn't the place for you either.  

Unfortunately we still had to wait about 30 min as the people at the table before us were taking their time.  Once seated we were offered a group rate - for $30 we got 2 boards of 6 meats, 6 cheeses and 6 varieties of olives, each diner got to choose their own social plates (a main but more the size of tapas) and 3 desserts for the table.  Check with the server as it depends on the size of the group to determine how many social boards (the meats/cheeses) and how many desserts the table gets.

The meats and cheeses are all sourced from the restaurants and are interesting and unique - you won't find them in your local grocery store.  There is actually a lot of choice but we decided to go with chef's pick so we were at the mercy of the chef that night.  Which was a good thing b/c the meats, cheeses and olives were all distinct in their tastes and really showcased and highlighted the amazing food available.  The boards come with spreads/bread as well.

For my main I decided to try the octopus with the couscous.  This is why I had to knock off a star.  It was SALTY.  To the point I could barely finish it...and I generally like a little more salt in my food anyways...but this was too much.  Other people who had ordered different items from the menu (steak, calamari) also mentioned their food was heavily salted.  We kept having to get our waters refilled b/c honestly all that salt made us beyond thirsty.  Hopefully it was an off night for the chef b/c I would love to come back and try some of the other menu items but not if salt is the main cooking spice..lol

Service was pleasant and the vibe here is definitely a fun one.  Definitely make reservations - especially if you are a larger group.  Even at midnight when we were finishing up dinner this place was still pretty busy."}
{"text":"Nuit Social is a such a cozy restaurant. It is a fairly small restaurant so it is relatively quiet. The atmosphere is nice and cozy with dimmed lighting. 

Service was great. The staff was very friendly and service was adequate. 

Food/drinks: 
The first section of the menu is a variety of meats, cheese, and olives for a customized charcuterie board. Nothing really wowed me and I wasn't expecting much. My group ordered a few dishes to share. We ordered the arancini, flat iron steak, and the daily catch of the day (salmon). The flat iron steak was impressive, they made it really well. I would definitely order this again because it was just that good. The other items was really nice too. The salmon dish had corn and diced chorizo. It was an interesting blend. 

Overall, the food was great. I wanted to try the parmesan cheesecake but I was too full by the time we got to desserts. Maybe I will return to try that cake and more cocktails."}
{"text":"Love this place! Found it late at night while me and my friend were looking for somewhere good to eat.

The concept is sharing platters which I've never done before. I loved it. I am a voracious eater and I felt pretty full after my friend and I split 3 meats and 3 cheeses.

Before we were served our platter we got some bread. It was buttery and soft and I want more of it as I type this review.

Then we received our bountiful platters. The only thing I wish, is that I would have saved the bread for when the platter arrived. But who am I kidding? When buttery bread stares at me, I eat it. The platters came with little toasts, but we ran out and didn't ask for more. The portions of cheese look small at first, but they have so much flavour, you feel full after eating them. The meats were delicious. Plus there were extras: like apple butter and cranberry sauce among many others. Each one was perfect.

I ended up spending around $14 with tip and tax and I got to eat high quality flavourful food. The owners were there and they were very attentive and seemed to really care about whether everyone was enjoying their night. Great place for a date :)"}
{"text":"this is a great spot to hang out with friends over some drinks and snacks. the space is very intimate, and the music is kept at a decibel level that doesn't require you to shout over it. 

he food is all tapas style, and on this particular night we had crispy calamari, PEI mussels, arancini balls, crispy frog legs, pork ribs with mac and cheese, and parmesan cheese cake for dessert. Yea...we eat alot. The food for the most part was good, but some dishes were a tad on the salty side. that could just be my taste, but my wife and her sister also concurred. it wasn't salty to the point of being unenjoyable, but when ordering perhaps keep it in mind in case you decide to be gluttons like us. we should have balanced the overall meal with less fried food, and more fresh vegetables of some sort.

Definitely a place to keep in mind the next time someone asks you if you want to go for a drink and hang out."}
{"text":"Great location and super cosy. The white walls with large pieces of art make the place have such an uber hipster vibe (like a bunch of places around the area.)

Came here before for drinks, and now for food, yay! Did Winterlicious, and for $25 you will definitely not be disappointed.

Roasted Chestnut Soup: Gives you the warm and fuzzies, with a hint of butter. It's perfect.

Beef Cheeks: The meat practically falls off. The mashed potatoes are definitely mashed with love or something. And it's just an amazing and filling combination. 

Chocolate Mousse: I would argue, it's more like a brownie but hey, no complaints here. It's super chocolately with a couple of blueberries and blackberries around. Something sweet to close the deal. 

The servers were also splendid. They are very welcoming and smiley as well. Overall I had a great time and no complaints. I would want to come again for the regular menu actually, as it is more like tapas and I love me some cheese and wine."}
{"text":"Really shocked by all the 5 star reviews.

Service in our case were really nice, and prompt.
The bad was the ambiance and the food.

Music is blasting through a little crummy Ipod/Radio,
Food was really upsetting. Ive had some amazing cheese platters for around the same price range, but they were generally very generous with the jams/pickles/breads, etc. For over $20, they supply you with some toast, and some rosemary \"wonder bread\", with a half teaspoon of some jams and mustard. 2pc poorly executed pickled green beans, and some dissected grapes. Sorry, big fail. Cheese was nice however. 

Could have had better olives from Loblaws... Smoked olives... more like flash grilled olives... 

Too bad. Was looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"Loved the menu here. Place was busy and had a nice non pretentious vibe. Enjoyed the aracini, octopus, and ribs with macaroni. Also tried the quail and while good it wasn't on the same level as the others. Did not have room for dessert after!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable wine bar. Delicious food and great service. The meat and cheese plates were excellent, and the calamari was a standout. Really nice vibe too."}
{"text":"This is a really cute restaurant on Queen Street in Toronto. We sat on the patio, where the ambiance was really nice because the walls were all wooden with lights hung up.

The server was very friendly and attentive towards our needs. Everything was also very flavorful. We got the deep fried artichokes, which were amazing. For mains, we also ordered the mac and cheese with baby back ribs (which were amazing!) as well as the gnocchi.

Great spot to check out if you are around the area!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from 2015 to give Nuit Social the full monty, 5 stars, because it's well deserved. I've been here several times over the past few years and they do cheese and charcuterie just right. Choose your cheese, your meats and your olives to create a custom board, and you pretty much can't go wrong, given the well-curated selections on offer. Also, I love the little accoutrements they serve to complement them (jams, mustards, etc).

As I may have mentioned in my first review, some of the hot appetizers--the fried calamari, in particular--are exceptional.

Overall, this is an intimate, very low-key spot where you can get your cheese on. Bonus: buck-a-shuck Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"(3.5) Nuit Social is a very laid back place and great spot to come and hang out with friends in an intimate setting. They specialize in tapas style dishes where everything is meant to be shared. They have sections dedicated to meats and cheeses so you can customize your own charcuterie board for a reasonable price. All in all the food is pretty good, service was great and a nice environment. Would come again, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"1. Cocktails here are high quality. The vast majority of restaurants in the city do not take cocktail seriously enough. This place delivers.

2. The ribs served on a bed of mac & cheese are spectacular. A trip to this restaurant, purely for this particular dish, is mandatory.

3. Friendly and attentive service, always. I've never caught them on an off night.

I'd always recommend skipping this restaurant - and every other restaurant in downtown Toronto - during summerlicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Nuit Social 6 or more times and I LOVE it. I have had a great experience every single time. The beet salad, scallops, and lamb shank are my favourite dishes. Cocktails are delicious, and the wine list (although small) is well-selected. The servers are efficient and friendly, and are always able to make a drink or food recommendation when I am torn between choosing. A neighbourhood gem!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a chilly Saturday night. I called for reservations, but we were seated at the bar. The place is small, but has a hipster ambiance. I would have preferred to have a private table, as I was planning on  trying out quite a bit of appies. Bar seating somehow limits  it. The charm  of the lady bartender compensated for the lack of table space. We had the charcuterie board, the iberico was so delicious and the cerignol olives were to die for, the rich buttery taste and perfect saltiness still haunts me. I have searched online as to where to get this, still havent succeeded. The arancii balls were good as well. The octopus dish was rich and delectable. Despite the crowd, we have no complaints about the service. I would want to try this place on a less busier night though and hopefully I can get a table this time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an impromptu winterlicious meal with a date. We did not have a reservation and the restaurant was busy but luckily there was one table let for us and we were seated right away. Service was fast and very friendly.

We started off with some type of beet salad. I am not usually a big fan of beets but this was pretty good. The next course was the braised beef poutine which was also excellent. A fancy poutine dish that was full of flavour. We finished off with the chocolate mousse which was very rich and delicious.

The cocktails were also great and served in cool antique glasses.

Definitely a nice spot for a date and I'll check it out again for sure!"}
{"text":"we went there for the buck-a-shuck deal and they were out that was very disappointing. we tried the boards and the olives. the olives tasted like the ones you get from metro. nothing different. The service was okay but didn't really like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decided to come in late friday night for a small bite to eat, and what better than sharing charcuterie boards and a few drinks. Located just a block away from the ever so popular Drake Hotel, we came into this little restaurant unsure we would be leaving knowing that we'd definitely be coming back. 

First and for most, the food. 

What we ordered on the charcuterie board:
Meat- Chorizo Iberico, Prosciutto, Coppa 
Cheese-Vermeer, Bellavitano Merlot Sartori, Taleggio(if you're looking for mild flavoured cheese, these were the best options!)
Olives-Mykonos(to die for), Fire Olives, Cerignol

Each and every pairing of cheese to meat to olives were outstanding. And it actually left us full at the end of the night to our surprise! 

Plus an order of Crispy Calamari that was cooked to perfection and delicious. 

To top off the night, our server was extremely helpful and knowledgable. She stayed attentive and regularly checked up on us, and always made sure we had drinks ect..

Perfect evening that exceeded our expectations. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is small but it has amazing food! We got a charcuterie board and the ribs with mac n cheese! Absolutely delicious! Service was ok, they forgot our food so it came out late but it was so good that I would still come again."}
{"text":"Where to start? An intimate space, didn't look too great for groups larger than ~6, otherwise, everything about the restaurant is 5 stars - from the food to the staff, and the washrooms were clean which is always a good sign.

My girlfriend and I went on a Wednesday for a date night, which is their buck-a-shuck, oysters were smallish, but didn't taste very fishy or 'seafoody?', for never really eating oysters, we thorougly enjoyed it and ordered a second round! We don't drink, so a pop allowed us to get as many oysters as we pleased but we went with a charcuterie board with 5 meats, 5 cheese, and 1 olive choice and was more than enough for 2 people.

What really stood out to us was the attentive staff, it wasn't a situation where one waiter got assigned to our table and we had to wait on one person for anything, but everyone working there assisted every table, and they consistently made sure everything was going well - really great service!"}
{"text":"Cozy spot. Nice selection of cheese and meats - fun to build your own charcuterie board - our servers gave terrific suggestions.  Overall service was fantastic.  Totally reasonable prices for food.  Wine quite a bit pricier than food but again, good server recommendation."}
{"text":"Amazing neighbourhood gem. My go to place for great service, great atmosphere and amazing drinks and share plates."}
{"text":"Can't really comment on the food as we came here for drinks...

we ordered
- olives
- cheesecake
- french press coffee
- hubby ordered a cocktail of some sort

From what we had, everything was great! Truthfully I really wanted to try their boards, but we had just came from dinner so wasn't hungry to order it...

will definitely want to come back to try the boards! Great place to hang out with friends..."}
{"text":"Nuit Social is the perfect spot for a nice, romantic dinner for two. There is indoor seating and a small, enclosed patio of tables outside. If there's good weather, I suggest an outside table.

The charcuterie is where it's at and it would be a shame to leave here without. These boards can be completely customized with selections of meats, cheeses, and olives. There were sooooo many fantastic options and the staff is knowledgeable and can help you make the best selection. 

They have great options for salads and I highly recommend the Arancini, which was little fried balls of saffron rice, sausage, and smoked mozzarella. It was ridiculously good.

Their wine bottles were half off so we ordered one for the table. I'm the only wine drinker in my party so I knew I wouldn't be able to finish (or at least I shouldn't), but the server was happy to recork the bottle and allow me to take it back to my hotel. 

Charcuterie, wine, and ambiance made this such a delightful dining experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a nice neighborhood treat. Don't go in expecting the world and it will be a good experience. The service is light, and had some hiccups, but they were pleasant and friendly. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board - the cheese was finished by the time the meat arrive. The selection was good and we enjoyed it, however they should be served side by side. We received the wrong course (we didn't know as our order was simply to 'feed us') at one point, and while one person at the table had a fork full, the server removed the plate and no on else could try it - I found this very odd. The only dish that I would steer you clear of was the lamb.  The best dish we had was the Octopus Gnocchi - a very delicious dish with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"I'd been dying to try this place because I LOVE charcuterie and cocktails! Came here with a friend and I was not disappointed.

Their drink list is most of your average fair, with a couple of original cocktails. They are all well prepared by the bartender (though quite pricey). 

We ordered three meats and three cheeses. They all came beautifully presented, with some homemade compotes and spreads, some crostinis and we got homemade focaccia (which was fluffy and light). EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! (I think it's impossible to go wrong with anything from the build your own board section) My favourite meat was the Sopresseta (like a spicy salami), and my favourite cheese was the Heliedoro Rosemary (which was subtly sheep-y and crusted with rosemary...YUUUUUM!

We also got the calamari, which was quite a large portion and super delicious! 

The price tag for this place hurts me a little, but I will DEFINITELY be COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"these bullshitters don't even try and tell you that there's an event and it's not even open to the public. An hour after they opened I got there and saw it myself then we had to go find some place else. And then somewhat many hours later they finally reply my message n tell something I found out myself hours ago. BULLSHIT! NEVER EVER AGAIN??"}
{"text":"This is a great little place just west of Dovercourt. I stumbled upon it after working out in the area. The place was a pleasant surprise. A friendly manager/owner and bartender greeted us. We sat at the bar and sampled the crispy calamari, black kale and quinoa and beef meatballs. While these may sound a bit like neo Irish bar fares I can tell you they far exceeded what you'd find elsewhere. The portions were a decent size too. Larger than tapas.
Wine menu was priced a tad high, but hey I'll take it to make sure a place like this stays open.
You can impress a date here.
Solid 4+"}
{"text":"Best date night spot! Love the customized charcuterie boards and the shareable meals. The Parmesan cheese cake is a must!!! Also shout out to our server Larissa who was just a ray of sunshine - amazing service despite a fully packed restaurant!"}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars.
Spent a few hours this past Saturday night here with 3 girlfriends, this restaurant offers pretty decent vegan options and top notch service (very attentive), I was well taken care of, being the only herbivore in my group. 

They have a full bar, $5 pints (the best one is Beau's and it's vegan). I recommend Black kale & Quinoa salad (porcini soffritto, carrot celery slaw) $14 and Roasted Broccoli & Cauliflower (garlic bread crumbs, pine nuts, pecorino)$11. 
Everything was great, I do prefer my food to have a bit more of a bite to it but I was still happy.  
Nuit Social is a great date place but they're also perfect for small groups of 4-6 as well, anything beyond that wouldn't work space-wise. 
This place is now firmly on my list of must-go-to restaurants with vegan options."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere! We arrived on a Wednesday night and it was a bit empty at first, but started to get busy throughout the night. The menu is very small and the dishes are meant to be shared. The special for the night was buck a shuck and we ordered half a dozen. The oysters were fresh and bigger than normal. We also ordered the calamari and flat iron steak with chimichurri. The steak wasn't as flat as I thought it would be and was cooked medium rare, which was good. The brussel sprouts and potatoes were grilled enough and crispy. The only bad thing about the dish was that it was a bit salty. The calamari was delicious and it was a big serving. The only complaint I have is that the calamari and steak arrived ten minutes apart, which was frustrating because both dishes are to be shared at the same time. Overall, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed me visit at Nuit Social and would come again! Located on Queen west, the store front is fairly small that you might miss it! We sat in the back patio which was sort of loud (air conditioning machines) and smelled bad due to the nearby garbage cans. 

Social Board 5 / 5 - Excellent for sharing. We ordered 3 meats and 2 cheeses. They have an excellent selection and I'd definitely recommend trying. Very fresh ingredients here that you can taste.

Pork Ribs Mac N Cheese 3.5 / 5 - Having read so many recommendations here, perhaps my expectations were too high. I thought this was a bit overrated. Ribs were tender but the flavour wasn't too unique (almost like chinese bbq pork) and the mac n cheese was... well mac n cheese.

Calamari 5/5 - I thought this was fantastic. Generous portion, cooked to perfect with a nice sauce for extra flavour. The calamari had a nice crunch on the outside but still fresh on the inside.

We didn't have any cocktails but they seem to have a pretty interesting selection."}
{"text":"Really small and cozy French place with hospitable and attentive staff and good food. I went there for the first day of winter luscious. The place was packed. Even tough we had reservation at 9 the tables were still all full with previous round and a long line formed. I could see that the owner was stressed but he managed it masterfully and kept everyone happy. We go our table after 15min but for few that had to wait longer he opened prosecco to drink while they where waiting. The food was really tasty and creative. Desert was just average. The place really reminded me of Montreal restaurants."}
{"text":"Quite little European place to have an romantic dinner, or just to sit and talk business:(

Anyways menu is a little bit hard to understand for first timers. Order meat, cheese and olives and one or two social plates, heaven."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite spots! Although the wait was long - there were a few large parties that took longer than expected to wrap up), the overall experience made up for it! 

Tino the owner was very apologetic for the wait, and gave a glass of bubbly to sip on! Tess the bartender is amazing at creating and whipping up cocktails, and provide amazing service. The food also didn't disappoint. I love that you can pick and choose what meats and cheese you'd like, rather than a pre-set charcuterie board. Calamari was delicious, as well as the arancini."}
{"text":"After a long, but wonderful work day in the lovely city of Toronto, I found myself starving while every kitchen seemed to be closed. Lucky for us Nuit, hence its name, stays open after 10PM and serves up some seriously delicious eats unlike no other. 

It's discreet, dimly lit, quaint, and sexy. We each ordered a glass of red and I indulged in a huge, ridiculously tender, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank served over a savory version of mushroom couscous. Tino, the man who was serving us was exceptionally pleasant and hospitable. During the close of our meal, we engaged in conversation only to find out that he was the owner of this wonderful establishment. From his kindness to the quality of the food, the menu selection and the beautiful space, it was apparent that he took pride in his business and appreciated his patrons. 

Can't say enough wonderful things about our delicious experience here. Looking forward to visiting Toronto again, and when I do, Nuit will certainly be on my to-go list."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I am surprised it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be but I had an early dinner on Friday. There was a special where for every cocktail you buy, you get a main dish for half off!

We had the meat and cheese board! It was perfect! I enjoyed every bite. As for the food, we got Pork ribs and Mac and Cheese. OMG. You have to get this. If you don't, you are missing out! The Pork Rib was crispy on the outside and juicy. I wished it was a bit more tender than it was. The juices from the pork ribs made a killer combination with the Mac and Cheese! I loved this dish! 

I thoroughly enjoyed this place but I am a charcuterie type of girl! I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great place and good prices. This is definitely a place for sharing dishes, with some great cheese and olive platters (we don't eat meat so no opinion on that).

Also the main dishes (again, aimed at sharing) were very nice.

Overall it's a good value for what you pay, and they have some nice specials too (Monday is 1/2 price on full bottles, great for groups!).

Also the atmosphere is very nice and intimate. Not many tables so get your reservations in.

The thing that put it from 4 to 5 stars though was how accommodating the staff was when we brought up an issue with one of our food items. Even though it was a serious issue, it can happen, and the staff was very forthcoming comp'ing us for the inconvenience - more than made up for the actual issue, which I think is what matters in those situations."}
{"text":"We had the Window seat. At the time there was a small gathering of about 7 women celebrating next to us. They kept it pretty chill so as not to disrupt. Our waiter was helpful and really assisted us in picking a desert. We ordered the cheesecake! Oreo & strawberries were a hit. I would have liked more Oreo. We are every bit. The bathroom was clean too. I always judge a place by the bathroom. Makes me think they truly care about cleanliness. It's kind of a big deal for me. Anyways, it was a nice spot that stays open until to 2am. Watching from the widow how lively things get at night. This place will hold a special place in my food memory. Those ribs pared with that smoked Mac and cheese LAWD!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Nuit, which we stumbled on a Monday night (lucky us, wine bottles are 1/2 price on Mondays!) during a visit from New York City. The atmosphere is laid back but elegant; we enjoyed sitting outdoors on the small back patio. The service was wonderful: genuinely friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious. We enjoyed charcuterie and the Italian fire olives, and a selection of the shared plates. The octopus fregola was a standout. Though we didn't have much room for dessert, we couldn't pass up the homemade parmesan cheesecake - it was worth the splurge. I can't recommend this restaurant enough - it's atmosphere, delicious food and reasonable prices made it one of our favorites in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Wow. Everything here is delicious. Excellent service, but really, it's about the food. From olives, to cheeses, to sharing plates and great wine, you are sure to have a great meal here. Warm and simple decor and ambiance makes for a great night out with another or a small group."}
{"text":"Just had a lemon curd with burnt marshmallow that was out of this world. The venison sausage was really good, the mussels with Parmesan were incredible, but desert topped it all!!!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake. Best ever. 
You won't be able to speak after your first bite.  
The venue is very nice and the staff is super friendly.
Great date night option."}
{"text":"Went here for the $70 Valentine's Day special and while I'm not a particular \"valentines celebrator\" had the best meal I've had yet in Toronto for the best deal. Romantic delicious well portioned and the owner was a warm and inviting gem of a man. Will be back when I have enough pennies for the treat!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Just the absolute best. Went here for an anniversary celebration. It was perfect. Romantic low lit spot, with perfect seating and a casual feel. Great menu! We got an assortment of meats and cheeses with our waiters help. Nice wine and good cocktails (perfect Manhattan)."}
{"text":"Another amazing tapas
Beware of line ups-book in advance
Olive selection and cheese selection are fabulous
They made an amazing sweet yet sour moctail"}
{"text":"After reading so many fabulous reviews, I had to make my way over to Nuit Social to check them out. While I wasn't as impressed as everyone else seemed to be, they are a very nice and quaint little spot that offers some nice options that would work for any palette. I found their drinks to be insanely pricey, and not especially great. The food was good, but took forever to be served even on a Tuesday night at 6:15PM. Maybe they were short staffed as the servers seemed to be very overwhelmed, yet still informative. All around, this is a nice place to go if you have the $$$, but for me there are many other options that would have left me with a better impression and more money in my wallet."}
{"text":"Delicious. Stopped by for a late late night bite with my husband. We were seated promptly on their beautiful back patio. Strung lights, super romantic. 

We ordered half a bottle of wine, a 3 cheese selection, the artichoke, and the frog legs. All were lovely and delivered the perfect temperature. 

The artichokes were crispy with slightly melted cheese on top and were just salty enough. The frog legs were crisp and super tender. In both cases I could have left the sauce. With the frog legs it tasted like straight honey, but the meat was so good on its own I barely noticed. 

If you're looking for small bites and good wine, this is your place."}
{"text":"Found this place just heading down Queen.  Great selection for the boards.  The Arancini and Short ribs were exceptional and the meatballs were just like homemade."}
{"text":"We came to Nuit Social for a girls' catch up dinner and was not disappointed.  Arriving without reservations around 6pm, we were able to be seated on their small back patio at a table for two.

Our friendly server was super helpful with food selections.  We ordered: a cheese plate with 3 selections as recommended by the server ($12) and a selection of 3 olives ($4) to start.  Since it was buck-a-shuck night, we ordered two dozen briny oysters and a half litre of green wine. To round out our meal, we shared 2 tapas - octopus ($14) and gnocchi ($15).  It was the perfect amount of food to share and we felt we got a nice variety.

Had a lovely time just hanging in the back patio with our casual dinner and it was actually quite romantic back there so I think a great date place!"}
{"text":"Amazingly tasteful food. Great service and perfect atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nuit Social is the type of spot Toronto needs more of. The space is intimate, the food is great and the drinks are on point. 

The charcuterie board, as many have mentioned, is well done at NS, with both the presentation and quality of the offerings exceeding expectations. That you can choose from a variety of delicious olives is also a very nice touch and something that more TO restaurants should offer. The mains, which are also somewhat tapas style, did not disappoint us either. From the dishes we tried the octopus was the best bet, while I would skip over the steak during my next visit. 

One particular complaint was the noise level which was a bit out of control during our visit. The restaurant can get very loud, and in our case, a rowdy group sitting a few tables away managed to kill the vibe. Aside from that, and wishing for a more comprehensive wine list, there is little that could be better at Nuit Social. 

Overall, worth a visit in a small group, but maybe too noisy for a first date!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was amazing the menu was great,  the cocktails were great, the patio was great. The second time was during winterlicious and was mediocre at best. I went in planning to spend a lot and order tons of great food. Unfortunately during Winterlicious the only make the Prix fix menu available.  This was not called out on their website at all so I was pretty disappointed that instead of ordering lots of olives, cheese and meat and delectable entrées I was only able to order what was on for winterlicious. The beet salad was meh, the beef cheek poutine was okay but didn't have much cheese. I found the portions very small. All I can say is that if you want to go here, don't go during winterlicious. Based on both visits I'd give an average of 3.5 stars (5 for my first visit 2 for winterlicious)"}
{"text":"After moving to Toronto 6 months ago, my girlfriend and I have frequented Nuit Social at least a dozen times. One of the best places in the city by far because of its amazing food, but more importantly, its amazing service. As Montrealers, we have admittedly high standards (we've been so spoiled with great cuisine for so long). Nuit Social would fit perfectly in the Montreal scene. Do yourself a favour and give it a try! 

Also, the ribs are out of this world. Tess is cool too."}
{"text":"Simple yet elegant restaurant, the menu has different varieties that are good for sharing. The olives and cheese selections are great."}
{"text":"This place is the cutest! It definitely has a date nite/ family gathering ambiance. I wasn't sure it was possible to strike for both, but Nuit pulled it off. Think candlelit with low lights and cool R&B (Chris Brown, Toni Braxton, Avant) coming thru the speakers. I had the smoky olives to start, which I could've left in the jar for the price. They weren't terrible, they were good olives actually, but at another spot something of the same sort in the same amount would be offered complimentary.  For the meal, I ordered the flat iron steak with fingerling potatoes. The chimichurri sauce was plate licking good, but there was hardly enough potatoes. Two to be exact. Maybe the idea was for the steak to really be the star, no sides necessary but, I could've used more starch on the plate to compliment the meat. In fact, a larger serving of the whole meal would've been nice, considering the cost. Perhaps being overpriced is just the Toronto way. At least the meal was really tasty."}
{"text":"Go here for a date or a good conversation with a friend. Take your time. This isn't McDonalds or The Keg.

Ambiance
The music was excellent and I really liked the overall light/mood of the space. Nothing was too loud and there wasn't a particularly shady dark nook either within the restaurant. I would say it was intimate but casual at the same time.

Food & Drinks

Cocktails are phenomenal. Try their whiskey sour or old fashioned. We tried their Marikoriko as well which was by far the best. They didn't have a caesar on their cocktail menu but they'll make whatever you want. I liked that. 

Again, take your time here and set aside two hours.

My girlfriend and I ordered a board with three meats, three of the cheese selections and some olives. I thought the meat and cheese was great but wasn't a fan of the olives. A little too strong for my taste. Note that I am not crazy about olives and can live without them.

I had the pork ribs and they were amazing. My only suggestion here is to make sure that you blend the meat in with the macaroni and cheese otherwise the flavours from the pork ribs are a little too much and the macaroni is simple bland/boring. When everything is mixed in together, we're taking about some legendary flavours here.

My girlfriend had the risotto gnocchi. I loved it. She liked it. I think she wasn't a fan of the leeks as there was a distinct flavour but I didn't mind it at all.

Service
Our server was amazing. Very informative. Tall gentleman. 

Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did!"}
{"text":"So we tried out Nuit's Social today to try out their lunch menu and was glad to finally fnd a spot to have a proper sit down for lunch and soon a dinner.

The service was amazing. They took their time to explain the dishes and also took their time to ask us about ourselves and get to know us.

The food was great and the patio is amazing. Will definately be back for their dinner menu. Heck my coworkers already reserved a table for this weekend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. My husband and friend made a reservation for a Sat night and, although we had to wait a few minutes to be seated (it's quite small) the service was great, cocktails were delicious and the food was beyond good. Don't go there without trying the ribs and mac & cheese, it was to die for. Would strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"A must visit in Toronto especially if you are staying in the neighborhood. The best cheese and charcuterie board I have ever had! We asked the waitress to put together the board and absolutely loved her selections. Drinks are delicious, the Tom Collins was very good. A bit pricy but most places in the area are. Will definitely be back our next visit!"}
{"text":"Perfection is an unfair adjective for anyone but if you define perfection as beauty, Nuit Social is certainly beautiful.  The food is as delectable as it looks.  The ambiance is a slice of Old Montreal in Toronto.  I could spent a large chunk of eternity on the back patio.  In fact, it was so charming that we had our dinner inside but dessert and coffee in the back when capacity opened up."}
{"text":"Been to Nuit only once for drinks, but will definition be going back soon to try them for dinner. The food we saw coming out looked delish! 
To add to that excellent service, friendly staff, cozy ambiance, not to mention a very cute back patio."}
{"text":"I enjoy their patio. It's small and private at the back of their restaurant. I enjoy their drinks and food, especially their selection if cheese and cold cuts. Fantastic service and the restaurant is walking distance from my place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow and inattentive service.

The food was like overpriced pub food - rich, heavy, salty, and pretty uninventive. 

I'm not sure why it takes 30 minutes to prepare a cheese board...

Wanted to go to the Commodore but it was too busy. Next time it will be worth it to wait, I won't return to Nuit Social."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to do here. The meats and cheese and salads and ribs floating on a bed of mac & cheese were otherworldly. But I seriously don't understand how 20 people inside and six people on the patio crippled the servers to the point where they just seem to disappear.  I get the sense that this is the kind of place where they don't care. The food is so damn good and there's just not enough seats that they know it will be filled night after night.  Yes, I said it the food is that damn good. You run into these little spots that are hard just because they're hot this place deserves a lineup.but it also deserves someone to come in clear plates and ask us what's next and get more drinks, and, and, and. You have to remember that people are hungry and thirsty and are there to eat and are just there to be blessed by the fact that they got a table."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that it's taken me so long to discover Nuit Social! 

When we arrived it was relatively busy, but we had a reservation so we were sat quickly. The cocktails were fantastic, and the service was great. 

The food was absolutely amazing! The customize charcuterie was a perfect start to dinner, I loved the variety. We also tried a couple other dishes. The pork ribs were unreal. 

I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the portion is so small.... I guess that's where the French part came from. To me, decent food with a stingy portion is just as bad as crappy food with a generous portion."}
{"text":"Love it!

I loved it so much that we came twice within three days and that's just because it was closed on Sunday!

The owner and bartender were both great. Super friendly and helpful. The drinks are good and made with care.

They have a great happy hour from 5-7pm daily. It includes half price main dishes. The mussels dish is huge and if you get that for half price ($6.50), you will not be sorry! Get the scallops (only $7 on happy hour!). Don't get the octopus though. It comes stewed in a tomato broth and was too chewy for us. I would suggest changing this to just grilled octopus. The fried artichokes were ok, some of the outer layers were too papery to eat.

We were too full to get the charcuterie plate, maybe next time.

Overall, a great place for drinks and snacks/dinner!"}
{"text":"This place opened in the space formerly occupied by Happy Child.  They've done a slight renovation, brightening the space with a coat of white paint, new lighting, and some tasteful splashes of colour.  The menu is tapas style-- we had mussels in a white wine broth, octopus in a tomato sauce, and fried artichokes with a puttanesca dipping sauce, followed by a small cheese plate.  The plates are larger than what you are usually served in Toronto tapas places, but the quality does not suffer: it was all excellent, as was the sourdough bread.  They have an impressive array of olives on the menu which you can mix and match. This is a great place for drinks and an elegant, informal dinner.  They have a nice selection of wine and beer, and some great looking cocktails (we stuck with beer and wine on this visit).  Staff at Nuit are very friendly and knowledgeable, and able to make helpful recommendations, without pushing you to order more as is sometimes the case in tapas places.  Owner Tino introduced himself and made some great wine suggestions; very likeable guy and I hope his little bar/restaurant is the success it deserve to be."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday evening with 3 others. We ordered 5 meats, 5 cheeses, 3 olives, 3 sharing plates (pork ribs, sweet potato bravas, and arancini), and cocktails (I had a pumpkin spice specialty cocktail). The cheese and meat board came with 4 slices of bread, a few slim pieces of toast, and some jam, Dijon, and butter. Everything was good. 

Special shout out to the pork ribs over mac and cheese, they were PHENOMENAL! The melted cheese inside the arancini were a pleasant surprise. I also loved the Rondin du Poitou goat cheese and Chorizo Iberico. 

Service was slow, our server apologized a few times about it. But the ribs over mac and cheese were so good that I don't even care. Also they do NOT ACCEPT AMEX!!"}
{"text":"Chose this spot to meet up with friends for an early Sunday dinner. Great choice! Friendly staff and comfortable setting. Menu was perfect for what we wanted. Great cheese, meat and olive selections to start and then some wonderful seafood dishes to share over wine. We will come back again. Worth a \"look see\"!"}
{"text":"If your into apps (like I am), this is the place for you. My partner and I love coming here for wine and cheese kind of night. The sheep with rosemary is our favourite! And the ribs mac & cheese will fill you right up!"}
{"text":"Oh my. This place was awesome. Came here for our anniversay around 11pm on friday.  Very quiet and friendly servers. Must try their signature cocktails. Delicious. Hope to revisit again!"}
{"text":"Nuit Social is a small restaurant on West Queen Street that draws you in with its simple, white minimalist design. It's simply beautiful. The dining area is in the front with a beautiful bar in the back. In the way way back is a small outdoor patio with additional tables. 

My friend, Keith, and I stopped by on a Saturday evening for drinks and were able to snag a small table in the back patio. We each ordered a beer/cider and enjoyed it. They have a local cider on their menu that was refreshing.

The service was friendly and attentive.

We can't judge the food since we didn't order any, BUT we can vouch for this place's drinks. It's good!"}
{"text":"Came here fresh from Toronto Pearson, for a snack and a couple drinks while waiting for a late dinner. The place has the look of a small, unassuming cafe, which is what most people seemed to be using the space for. I saw a group of people near the front with computers out, but there was a full bar, as well as a few parties enjoying some charcuterie, so there was definitely a range of clienteles.

I was told that the ribs was the go-to thing on the menu, and the charcuterie was calling out to me as well, but I declined reluctantly, simply because I had dinner plans in a few hours. I went for the smoked sausage arancini, and an old-fashioned. Weird combination, for sure, but I didn't quite care, as I was slightly delirious from my 42-minute airplane ride from LGA. A rough life, indeed. The arancini came out pretty quickly, and they were enormous, with 4 to an order. About the size of a jumbo egg, the crispy fried rice balls were oozing with a LOT of melted mozzarella, and the smoked sausage had a really good spicy flavor. Pretty bomb. 

The old-fashioned was very well-made, and quite strong with a generous pour. After my old-fashioned, I tried one of the local (and I mean local) brews from Lost Craft Beer. I felt quite special, as the beer was small-batch brewed in Toronto, and there wasn't much availability. The Revivale lagered ale came in a limited edition all-white tallboy can, which was pretty cool-looking. The beer itself was delicious and refreshing, and had a really crisp taste. 

Service was great at the bar. The bartender, Tess, was really great with recommendations, as well as recommendations for what to see in Toronto. Prices were a bit on the more expensive side, but I think the value is there, as the portions are very generous for the price. Overall, the experience was seamless, and I really enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere. Will easily make a return trip on my next stint in Toronto. Gonna have to try those signature ribs!"}
{"text":"Nuit is a charming gem of a spot. First of all, the food is amazing. One of the most memorable dish I had there was the octopus gnocchi on their \"Social Plates\" menu (although it's not on the menu at the moment, but many of their other items are just as delightful). I also love that you can build your own charcuterie/cheese/olive board too, and the staff working there are very knowledgable and helpful with your selection. We asked our server to help select our cheeses depending on what we liked, and our cheeseboard was scrumptious. I think what elevated it was the housemate chutney/jams/mustards along with the selection of bread that was made in house. Tess is also a cocktail wizard. She is very knowledgable with the interplay of flavours. She invents her own cocktails as well as serving up a bunch of good old classics. And she also makes her own shrubs and syrups from fresh ingredients! There is also a good selection of wine for those more into wine. It is a tasteful and chill spot with good atmosphere/lighting/music that is good for anything from a gathering with a group of friends to a romantic date night."}
{"text":"Came to this place last Valentine's Day and was blown away! Promise I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets of Queen West--especially their 2 for 1 food special between 4-7! I have been to this quaint gem twice now and thoroughly enjoyed both meals. Great variety on the menu. 

Pro tip: the patio at the back is clutch in the summertime!"}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the recommendations given by our server. We will definitely be back!"}
