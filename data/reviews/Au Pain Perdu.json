{"text":"Before Au Pain Perdu, I wasn't a fan of eating out for breakfast. I ordered the le gros t'ouef (2 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, potatoes, beans and fruits), and it blew my mind. My taste buds died and went to heaven. Yea, that's how much I loved it. Even though they forgot my ham and beans I couldn't even be annoyed because the food was distracting me. Coffee was good, and staff was friendly. 

I'd give it the full 5 stars (gladly) for its food and ambiance, but the entrance/waiting area is awful. I mean, there isn't one. You walk in the door and you're standing and blocking the path to the exit/entrance and the upstairs which is so inconvenient because people are coming and going non stop, including staff who are carrying lots of food up the stairs."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service killed the experience. Servers were disorganized, they didn't seat us forever even though there were many empty tables. They forgot to place our order and we waited over 40 minutes for our food. I had the Pain Perdu which was tasty but couldn't make up for the poor service. Too bad, won't be going there again!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious brunch here as this place lived up to its reviews we had read before going. One of our favourites was the French toast with Apple, cheddar and an apple compote! The service was also amazing (the server we had was very helpful explains everything in English and was attentive throughout)."}
{"text":"Didn't get a great first impression of the place :/ (early Sunday morning)
Ordered the Folie Valmont with goat cheese, and it left a lot to be desired. The hollandaise sauce wasn't sauce, it was foamy and dry. The goat cheese was brie mixed with goat, and they insisted it was all goat. The fruits weren't very fresh either. Only upside was the potatoes, those actually tasted really good!

I'd give it a second chance, but I'll be careful what to order next time."}
{"text":"This place is ok. No surprise here, you can expect the traditional brunch fairs: big portions, fresh products and all the usual suspects on the menu. It's got a family friendly atmosphere and good portions but the food itself is not outstanding. For more options in the hood, check my article: https://delifeed.ca/2016/03/05/plateau-mile-end-brunch-spots-for-all-kinds-of-brunchers/"}
{"text":"Usually go there for the pulled ham.. very disappointed for the second time either because of the quantity or because the cooking was not done properly even the staff didn't seemed to know what the problem was. Odd. I'll give it one more try because the restaurant is definitely a good one in MTL for Bfast and hopefully they'll keep it up to standards!"}
{"text":"I loved it here so much I've been here twice in ten days!

B E N E D I C T (with Bacon in Bechamel Sauce):
4 out of 5 times most brunch places I've been to over cook my eggs especially when poached. I like mine oozy with yolky goodness. As busy as this place is on the weekend, I just expected overdone eggs. When I pierced my oeufs with my fork, the yolk dribbled out, and I was Perdu heaven taking a bite with the creamy sauce. The potatoes are well done and chopped in thick blocks which I had never seen before. 

E G G S (with sausage, ham, bacon and cretons):
It's a meat party for breakfast! Probably didn't need ALL of that but I had to try em all. The golden ham was hands down the best! I don't know what they do to them, but they quenched my savory thirst. Of course, I had to test em on the eggs again and they pleased me again!! 

The waitresses are attentive, nice and patient with my beginner French - especially Rosalie! Noticed they also had these funky art pieces on the wall for sale! What an innovative way to collaborate and support the local community.  The owner of this bustling brunch spot cooked up a charming cafe offering classic brunch served by upbeat, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in the plateau. The food and people were nice. Like others said, a bit overpriced for what you get. They make their own specialty jams and they taste great!"}
{"text":"Friendly waiters and even offered to help translate the French menu (they didn't have any English menus). Besides that, the food was nothing memorable. I had the Mattresses de Valmont  and it was drenched in cream making it rather flavorless. I would say skip this place for brunch the prices did not match the quality."}
{"text":"Ended up at Pain Perdu after deciding to forgo the L'avenue lineup on a Sunday morning. This sweetly renovated house turned restaurant has a distinctly retro feel in a very good way. They opened up the entire front area which allows alot of natural light in. The vibe is very relaxed and casual which is exactly what I want when I'm getting brunch on the weekend. I had an omlette with some bacon and onions. I love that their portion sizes are large. I also ordered a french toast on the side which was great too. I would say overall their food is good but not blow your mind amazing. I would definitely come here again for a fuss free brunch experience."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in Montreal by some distance, and I've been to a fair few. The decor is cheerful with bright colours and friendly staff. With eggs benedicts, omelettes, french toast and waffles, this place has something for everyone.

I had the Florentine eggs benedict which was superb. They use sauce Mornay instead of sauce hollandaise which is a nice change. They also sprinkle shredded cheese over the eggs to give the dish a very rich, creamy flavour. The potatoes are cooked to perfection - just enough to get them crisp and seasoned. They have a special house mayonnaise which is particularly good.

Their signature dish is their Pain Perdu which is very well presented - a huge stack of french toast stuffed with jam, drizzled with chocolate and maple syrup and surrounded by fruit. It was really well done as well and sharing these two dishes between two people left me perfectly satisfied.

Overall, great brunch place and I couldn't recommend it more!"}
{"text":"Au pain perdu est mon endroit favori pour aller déjeuner! Découvert il y a pres de deux ans, je crois y avoir mis les pieds plus d'une 10aine de fois. Pour 9$, on a une assiette tres difficile à terminer (4.4.2.9!): jambon effiloché, patates, 2 oeufs, et je prends toujours le pain baguette. Le seul aspect négatif, c'est qu'il m'est arrivé de voir pas mal de différences d'une fois à l'autre dans mon assiette (facile a comparer etant donné que je prends tjrs la meme chose!!)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, very friendly staff and a great atmosphere. The menu is in French but they will help you translate. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The all-vegetarian omelette brunch comes with fruits: watermelon, oranges, kiwi. Serving size is very large, the eggs are well-cooked with mushrooms and onions and so are the fried potato sides. The bread pieces are crunchy and toasted with a small amount of butter. 

Impressed with the interior design of the small space. Service is fast and friendly. Definitely recommend for anyone who wants a good brunch place in Mont Royal."}
{"text":"Food was tasty! There was no wait for our large group of eight which was surprising for a Saturday morning! L'Avenue around the corner seemed to have a wait of an hour or more so this was definitely nice. Atmosphere was warm, light, and the place was nicely decorated. Food came out quickly and service was friendly, and even though the menu was only in French, our group all seemed to enjoy our food. I had the over easy eggs with ham and all meals came with a fruit salad. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for food that's only just ok... a small portion of French toast with barely any fresh fruit ended up being $20! Very nice staff and quick service, though."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I did not like this place at all. The crêpes has a strange taste and some of the blueberries were extremely mushy and had mold. The glass of water I was given was dirty and the spoon they gave me still had food on it. Also, the food was not warm.. it was just room temperature. There are definitely better places to have brunch."}
{"text":"cute name, so why then, are there two?

:Plateau:

Lost Bread.  Cute right?  It's also called Le Pistou Déjeuner.  As to why? Your guess is as good as mine.  I'm sure Google, Yahoo or Bing knows?  It's irrelevant to my review.

This was my last brunch before I headed back to Toronto.  It was good.  It wasn't top tier, but I would likely go again.  (What's top tier you wonder?  You know where to find the answer, but here are two: Les Folies and Lawrence.)

There was quite a long line, but it was all one party, so we got seated fairly quickly, 5 minutes in fact.

Au Pain Perdu is a casual dive that serves up your usual brunch fare - benedicts, eggs plus, pancakes, etc. - at the usual prices.

I opted for the classic eggs benedict (missed it because Saturday I ate Le Cartet), while my sister had the two eggs plus bacon, ham, and sausage.  My benedict was good, although my hollandaise was thick enough that I could have molded little figurines.  It looked as if they had put the plate under a salamander or something because my hollandaise had a top crust.

My sister's was what you'd expect, but on the blase side.

All in all, it was greasy spoon brunch.  Perfect for a jeans and T Sunday."}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly staff service, the loud Latino music early in the morning was not my idea of a relaxing Sunday morning, the bottomless coffee was mediocre , too many items on the menu, it took my partner and I about 20 minutes to settle on ordering. Our food came within 5 minutes. It was very good,  I decided on a simple egg breakfast after my frustration with the menu and hunger panic set it. My partner ordered poached eggs with bacon and moray cream sauce on an English muffin. Very pleased with it.  Potatoes that come with breakfast are excellent, very well seasoned and the home made mayo is artistry that pleases the palate. Definitely a place to come back to for brunch....check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent little place for a quick delicious breakfast! We, like other reviewers, were going to try the place down the street but the line was out the door. However, this place hit the spot. We got a delicious meal with great service. Their lattes are also amazing! I recommend them 100%!"}
{"text":"Menu varié. J'ai pris des ufs bénédictins avec du jambon effiloché. Délicieux!!! J'ai pris un jus de pamplemousse frais qui était pas trop sucrer. Pareil comme boire un pamplemousse. Que café par contre est pas super. Manque de goût selon moi."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my mushroom omelette, it was undercooked, under seasoned, and poorly put together.  The whole dish was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Très, très ordinaire. J'ai pris des ufs bénédictines au fromage de chèvre et c'était vraiment pas génial. Le jaune des ufs n'était pas coulant et le fromage froid était coupé en une grosse tranche épaisse qui refroidissait tout le plat. Les patates étaient froides et sans trop de saveur. Les fruits se limitaient à trois tranches de melons. Bref, c'était froid et sans saveur."}
{"text":"Really good food, friendly staff and fresh fruits. Underestimated place in ratings but this is an authentic Canadian breakfast place"}
{"text":"Delicious omelettes and lattes, friendly service (even though they were packed), nice ambiance downstairs. Upstairs was very loud - something to cover the mostly bare walls here and there might help the echo-chamber. 

The upstairs needs some love, it's well lit but otherwise feels like a half-finished basement (large screw holes in the wall near us were the only \"decoration\"). We'll wait for a table downstairs next time."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely 5 stars! And I loved the atmosphere. The service knocked it down a star and, if you are in a rush or really prioritize service, it may be a risky choice. But I think its a great local spot!

I had \"les caprices de lysanne\" - a wonderful crepe that had some carmelized sugar on the edges and was stuffed with roasted pears and a pungent cheese. The flavours went really well together. My sister enjoyed the classic eggs benedict dish. The dish is served with a substantial amount of meat - not your typical back bacon! The hollandaise was nice and buttery.

The service started off great! But as the restaurant filled up, the one server for the two floors just couldn't keep up. It was really hard to get his attention to ask for our check, although we were not in a rush. He was an excellent server working very hard - they are just understaffed."}
{"text":"J'adore retourner à ce petit resto déjeuner. C'est souvent plein, mais le staff est amical (on est loin du service froid et pompeux de certains endroits sur le plateau). Il n'y a pas de menu pour enfants, mais le chef peut faire des demi-assiettes au besoin."}
{"text":"Petite découverte du samedi agréable. Ce n'était pas du tout achalandé pour une journée de week-end ce qui est plutôt agréable considérant le fait que ce resto est situé sur le plateau (mais pas directement sur l'avenue Mont-Royal). 

Le service était impeccable et chaleureux sans oublier de mentionner qu'il était rapide. 

Les portions étaient raisonnables surtout rapport qualité prix, je n'hésiterais pas à revenir!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, but they could use a couple more hands on deck... 
I brought my family here for a really good send-off breakfast to conclude my parents visit.  We got in before 10 am on Monday morning when it was relatively calm, but the place quickly filled up and the sole server had his hands full, which made it hard to serve all the tables, on both floors. The kitchen was totally backed-up and food came out slowly and with a lag between dishes, so we didn't really eat together at the same time. Nevertheless, the food was fantastic. Everyone enjoyed it, and that doesn't always happen with my family (each person has peculiar food preferences). This was truly a great meal!
I had a MishMash - one of the best omelettes I ever tasted: it contained beef merguez with feta cheese and pesto. The potatoes were awesome!
If it wasn't for the super slow service (though it was granted with a smile!) it would have been a five-star meal. It was my first time here, and I'm not sure if this is always the case. Maybe it was extra busy for a Monday morning... but I shouldn't make excuses for them - like I said - we had a good time, and had a few extra minutes to spare, so no harm done!"}
{"text":"A great brunch place with a friendly atmosphere. The portions are huge. Service was excellent. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Comme dit ma femme, quand tu sors au restaurant, il faut que ça vaille la peine... ici ça ne vaut pas la peine.  Rien n'est relevé, aucun assaisonnement. Espace trop restreint. Service sans façon... il y a beaucoup mieux ailleurs. Tous nos plats étaient bof au mieux. Pas facile de décevoir au déjeuner, mais ils y parviennent ici.  C'est cher de surcroît et tout est en extra, y compris confiture.  En plus, aux dires de mon fils, les toilettes... pas terrible..."}
{"text":"This place was way too busy and crowded and the poor waiter was all alone serving two floors. I think if they had two waiters at least it'd have been a nicer experience. Needless to say, the guy was very pleasant and patient with my English even though it was in a very Francophone neighbourhood. The food was alright, I've had many crepes in my life, and these weren't the most incredible. It said that it came with goat cheese chevre, but I think it was bits of melted brie and then maybe a tiny piece of chevre in there somewhere...but the brie skins don't melt so that wasn't very appetizing, and the pears inside were too sweet, plus they give you syrup, which I didn't realize would be overkill in the end. 
I'd go here again, but probably during the week when they're less busy."}
{"text":"Nous étions sur le Plateau et voulions aller bruncher dans à l'Avenue mais comme il y avait beaucoup de monde nous avons renoncé. Puis en marchant nous avons vu Au Pain Perdu alors nous sommes rentrés pour manger.

L'accueil est poli mais sans plus. Nous avons été placés en face des cuisiniers, nous voulions cette place car les autres tables étaient vraiment trop rapprochées les unes des autres.

J'ai pris \"La folie de Valmont\". J'ai vraiment été déçue par ce plat. Il y a eu peu de fruits et ceux-ci étaient vraiment de mauvaise qualité. Les patates étaient presque écrasées. Les oeufs pochés n'étaient pas assez cuits et la sauce hollandaise sans gout. Je n'ai vraiment pas aimé.

Mon conjoint avait pris des gaufres avec des fruits et il a bien aimé, c'est pour cela que je mets 3 étoiles sur 5.

Je ne conseille pas ce restaurant, il n'est pas bon marché et les ingrédients de première qualité des plats servis ne méritent pas de payer autant de $$ !!"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict with ham gets a 4/5. The ham made this dish exceptionally flavorful- lightly salted, slow cooked pieces that pull apart with your fork. The dish was served along with coin cut deep-fried potatoes. 

I also ordered the buckwheat pancakes 2/5 (to split), the syrup added sweetness to the cakes however I found them to be bland and on the dry side, but I'm keeping in mind this comes with the offering this type of pancake. The pancakes were served with honey yogurt, which helped moisten when piled on top of the pancake."}
{"text":"Great cute little place a little off the beaten path. A great back up option when la avenue has a long line. Make sure to try the eggs Benedict with brie"}
{"text":"My friends and I ended up coming here after waiting in a line that was too long elsewhere. Let me tell you, was not disappoint. The management is extremely accomodating. They let me charge my phone while we were seated. I ordered the eggs benedict and was initially told that they had run out of butter and couldn't make the hollandaise but later the owner came to tell us that someone had gone out to get butter and so they were able to make it for us. The food was phenomenal. I would absolutely go again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast. We tried the Pain Perdu, eggs Benedict w Hollandaise, crepes w pear and semi sweet chocolate, among other items. Overall. Pretty good. Liked the orange juice too."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Diner food. Very average. Too expensive for what you get. So many other options, kind of embarrassed for them! And yes, hollandaise did have a film. Are the plates reheated because they're per-prepared or is it done on purpose??? I don't know but will not eat there again. And as an Italian, bocconcini have no place on a breakfast plate. And the tomatoes used for the salad were old and grainy. Yuck!! (most dishes come
With the side of tomato and bocconcini). The vinaigrette made is particularly bizarre...."}
{"text":"I literally just inhaled my brunch here.
There are a couple of reasons for that! 

First of all, it was trés deliceux. I had Les Maîtresses de Valmont, which is poached eggs on English muffin with bacon, cheese and Mornay sauce drizzled over. The potatoes, as many reviewers have said, are unique to this place and extremely good but the real bonus for me was the generous serving of homemade mayo that came with them. It was light and delicate, artfully made. The fruit on my plate left a little to be desired but then again, it is early April in Montreal - not quite garden season. 
Second reason for my instant brunch plate inhale? Well, the menu offers sooooo many choices (too many choices) that it took forever to decide on something. Also, the one dish I reaaaally wanted isn't served on weekends!! My manfriend was getting pretty HANGRY by the time we finally made our choices! Hahahaaa. However, when we did finally order, our plates arrived to our table miraculously fast. 
Our server was wonderful - she seemed to psychically know our needs and was extremely attentive to them. Plus, she was bright and friendly and kept our coffee cups filled to the brim the entire time. Yes, infinite diner coffee! She also told us the theatrical and mythical inspirations behind the names of the dishes, so we heard some good stories, too. 
The only thing I wasn't really feeling at first was the music choice, which was South American romantic ballads mixed with Reggaeton, but the sun was shining for the first time in days, and refracting through my water glass to make little rainbows were all over the table, so I warmed up to it eventually."}
{"text":"Svp goûter à la confiture....hummm! Délicieusement fait maison! Bravo les gars! Excellent endroit pour vos rencontres ou le travail car vous avez accès a internet"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. The service is horrible. They are so RACIST. The lady with the reddish hair at the register slammed food on our table. No one came to check in. We were handed dirty utensils. I don't even think this place deserves 1 star."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Decor 4/5
The benedict eggs and waffles were really delicious and came with fruit. 
The french toast was good but nothing special. 
The restaurant is quite small which offers a cozy ambiance.
One of my favorite brunch locations in Montreal."}
{"text":"4*?!?...have this place changed dratiscally or people just cant distinguish good from bad food?? Most definitely the worse brunch place that I've been in a long time. 

Took their signature dish pain perdu...oh god was it nasty! First, I don't understand why the chef put rosemary in this dish...it gave a weird taste to the pain perdu. Second, the dish was covered in chocolate sauce and powdered sugar...overly sweet.

Also had a meringue bénédictine.  The hollandaise sauce was cold and looked like it had been just heated in the microwave. 

Tried their fresh squeezed mango and strawberry juice and it was horrible as well...$5 for a small juice. It was so bad that I only took a few sips.

3 people and our bill came to $70...overpriced for the quality of food we had. Will never come back.

Heard the table behind us say that it's the best brunch place they have been to?!?..."}
{"text":"Super petit resto à brunch original ! Vraiment une excellente découverte ! Les assiettes sont abordables et le goût est très bon et les bols de latte sont bons !"}
{"text":"Food is actually have decent. Not bad at all. I really enjoyed the potatoes. But the service was horrible!! Took forever to get a waitress to come over and take down the order. Not to mention getting charged 2.95$ for 3 asparagus... I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot!!!

If you are one of those people who does not believe in waiting 30+ hours in a line for food (see L'avenue) then this place is a good alternative. Actually, the food is a bit better than L'avenue. The place reminds me of eating in a cute, brightly colored cabin.  The brunch menu is huge, but there were not any menus in English (the staff translated items of interest to is).  I went with the breakfast poutine (standard poutine with bacon, sausage, and mushrooms) which did not disappoint. The serving size of the dish was large enough for two people. 

The service was pretty fast and the waiters were really nice. 

I think that this will be my go to place in Montreal (near Mont Royal) for brunch. Long line at L'avenue...\"Ain't nobody got time for that\"."}
{"text":"Étant fan fini de brunch, je les essaie tous et peu importe ce que les reviews disent, je me dois de donner une chance aux différents restaurateurs. Donc quand ma soeur m'a dit qu'il y en avait un que nous n'avions pas essayé sur Mont Royal, on ne pouvait qu'y aller. L'établissement est mignon à première vue, la salle du bas à seulement quelques tables et il y a une autre section en haut. J'aime les murs de brique, ça donne toujours un aspect réconfortant. Le serveur, il était seul, était sympa et rapide. Donc de ce côté je n'ai rien à dire. Je prends mon traditionnel café filtre, c'est un besoin vitale. Là, la deception commence. Le café n'est pas vraiment bon en fait. Puis nous commandons nos plats. Personnellement je n'ai pas accroché avec le menu. Beaucoup de choix qui ne m'intéressaient et peu qui étaient originaux. J'ai pris ce qui ressemblait à un club sandwich déjeuner avec oeufs, bacon et tomates sur pain blanc. Ma mère le pain doré avec fruits et ma soeur un plat traditionnel avec oeufs, muffin anglais, jambon et crêpe. Et bien c'était bof! Pas vraiment bon, pas vraiment dégueux, aucun enthousiasme de notre part. Dans un quartier ou presque tous les restaurants proposent des brunchs s'il vous plait faites un effort quand même pour garder la clientèle. Je ne vois aucune raison d'y retourner ou même de le recommander et c'est dommage ils avaient un bon potentiel avec leur espace."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The brunch is yummy, but nothing too special. $$ is a bit under estimation as I find this place quite expensive for what it offers."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We were seated upstairs and the area is cute, if a tad cramped. The service is decent, they  are attentive enough to get your order and bring your food. They were a little hard to find when time to pay, but not too bad. The portions are slightly large, but not enough to make you feel sick, should you decide to finish your plate. The eggs were quite good, and the price is fair. All in all, not a bad place to have brunch!"}
{"text":"A relatively undiscovered gem right off of Mont Royal with a strong focus on brunch. They're typical breakfast plates (full English, Benedict, omelettes) are well above  average, while their signature dishes (fruit gaspacho an their namesake, Pain Perdu) are out of this world delicious. 

Really friendly environment with exceptional service, Au Pain Perdu is definitely a top choice for weekend dining."}
{"text":"Au Pain Perdu est un restaurant qui offre tout ce que vous pouvez attendre d'un brunch classique: bénédictines, omelettes, etc. Les prix sont raisonnables et alignés avec ceux des autres restaurants. L'endroit est assez cozy (et bien éclairé par le soleil!) et il y a une mezzanine. Ce n'est probablement pas le restaurant dans lequel vous vivrez un brunch mémorable mais, si vous en avez assez de faire la file à L'Avenue et/ou n'osez pas vous aventurer chez d'autres restaurants plus créatifs comme Le Sain Bol, Au Pain Perdu peut être une option à considérer! Sometimes that's all you need. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where you go for brunch if you live in the plateau.  When I lived there, this was the best brunch I had found and I dragged my friends out here at least a half dozen times."}
{"text":"Decent (and surprisingly light) brunch at a somewhat expensive price.

I would definitely recommend The Big or any of their eggs Benedict! Their pork lard spread with toast is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and if I could give a 3.5 that really would be the most fitting score.  Not bad, nothing spectacular.  Had their version of a western omelet and it turned out rather average.  Had an extra french toast and that was below average.  It really felt like everything was 3.00$ more than it should've been.

You should consider this place as a last-ish resort in the Plateau.  Nothing memorable, nothing bad either.  Just a really average place.

Will likely never go back."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Friday mid-morning. The service was stellar, the chef cared that everything was to our liking. The food was better than most morning food. Great coffee, reasonable prices. I would be happy eating here each morning until I'm returned to the Earth."}
{"text":"The reviews have it right - this place is a hidden gem. But here is what they haven't told you, information I wanted before committing to brunching here: the hollandaise and Mornay sauces are homemade, and the ham is not a rubbery slice but dark pink, hacked off the bone, smokey and rich. The service is friendly and efficient, and the chef will come right out of the kitchen to wish you Bon Appetit. 

For me, brunch is about sauce (check), potatoes (ermagahd), bottomless coffee (yes), and ripe fruit (hurray!).

Charming, delicious, and checks every box. This is the first visit of many, if they can remain consistent. One wish? Some newspaper options. English or French, I don't mind, but something more than 24h would have been much appreciated. BYO-crossword!"}
{"text":"Des assiettes bien pleines et pleins de couleurs comme on les aime en fin de semaine.
Très bon service et le gout est bien dans l'assiette."}
{"text":"Ordered the ham Benedict. The style of Ham was fantastic but the overall taste was meh.  The Hollandaise sauce was dry and not super flavorful.  Seemed almost as if it had been sitting on a hot plate waiting for some sucker to order it.  The fruit wasn't fresh and the potatoes, although pretty good didn't seem fresh either.  I would go elsewhere, but it's not the worst. It's Sunday brunch, you should be killing it.  Cute place though.  Came here to not wait in line at Restaurant L' Avenue.... Body says \"thank you\", tummy says \"damn it!\"."}
{"text":"Super fast service, they normally always have tables available and the food is reaaaallyy good!"}
