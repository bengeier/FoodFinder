{"text":"Finally! A real pizza in Calgary!  I swear, I've been looking for years to find decent 'Za to no avail.  What I hate most about pizza in Calgary is everyone uses salami-sized \"pepperoni\", which just isn't the same as the toonie-sized real pepperoni that I'm used to.  Pizza Bank was a last minute decision - no dinner, no ideas, craving pizza, so after surfing the net, I found the Bank's menu. Once I saw a picture of real pepperoni, I knew it was going to be a winner.  It took 15-20 minutes from placing the order to picking it up at the stripmall at Glenmore Landing, and it was piping hot when I got there. A bit pricey at ~$30 for two mediums, but it was well worth every penny! It was a relief to see that this place was spotless, and the staff were friendly.  The crust is soft yet crispy (I'd say \"medium\" thickness), the toppings are fresh (no canned mushrooms here!), and there was just the right amount of cheese and delicious pizza sauce.  Pizza Bank is also open for lunch, and apparently they have daily specials starting at $5, so I think I'll be back soon! They've got all the accoutrements as well, like wings, salad, drinks, etc.  Pizza Bank is pick-up and delivery only, with delivery offered for addresses within 3 miles starting at 4:30pm till close."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how sad I am to have to rate Pizza Bank with one star. Ever since high school, this was my favourite pizza in town. I had not had it in about 5 or 6 years as I live nowhere near it any longer, and I had been craving it, so ordered it as a Friday night treat. I will never be ordering from there again.   What the heck, Pizza Bank? The crust lacks the flavour and freshness it once did, the wonderful pizza sauce recipe has been messed with somehow, and the amount of toppings put on was absolutely paltry, made worse by the fact that the pizzas were shown the SCANTEST bit of cheese, so miniscule an amount that because of the baking, it turned into a thin, tough, flavourless layer. How miserly to skimp on the cheese! And at the prices being charged ($30 for two mediums), these should be premium pizzas. Thanks for taking my favourite pizza joint that has so many great memories attached to it and ruining what was a great pizza."}
{"text":"I don't know. It's good pizza, but not as AMAZING as a half assed pizza joint would be in NYC or Chi.   Ordered a large hawaiian for pickup - 21 tax in. Ehhhhh. Ready in 20 minutes. Dope.  We get home and eat a pizza that's quite alright. A little cheap on the cheese. Ok ham. Canned pineapples. Ok sauce. Really good flaky crust. The crust was great. But the pizza had all the qualities of a pizza hut pizza. It tasted exactly like a pizza hut hawaiian pizza. And I don't mean it as that much of an insult, I mean, I'm not comparing this to dominoes or...ugh.. CPU.  I will come back and all, but I dunno, there's better pizza in Calgary."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent and they were willing to help me out on the large pizza where half of it was done one way the other half was done another way and then I decided to just order two pizzas so that we have our pizza way each of us like and actually it was kind of funny because both pizzas came done 50-50 however it doesn't matter because they were delicious and thank you for your great service"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town. Even though I don't live in the neighbourhood anymore I still drive 20 minutes to pick it up. Crispy crust, no too thick or too thin, the perfect amount of cheese and lots of toppings!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for Buy one get one free. When I called to order Pizza,  person on the other line was extremely rude and he doesn't want to listen to the customer.  He doesn't know how to talk to the customer on the phone, I am ordering Dominos right now. Horrible Customer service."}
