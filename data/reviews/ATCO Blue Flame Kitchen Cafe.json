{"text":"ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen Cafe - Vegan options.... Salad anyone? They didn't know if the bread contained egg or dairy, no ingredients list. I asked the older server to find out so when I visit next time he will know. I had a Beet & Arugula salad with Avocado added instead of goat cheese and a bag of BBQ chips. Nice enough but I've been starving for the rest of the afternoon. I asked the helpful young guy there if I was the first Vegan to visit the cafe. He replied with no and an interesting expression, almost pity. I think if it was up to him, he would have loads of options available. Eh well... A bit disappointed. Service is very good otherwise. I miss Mercatino already. :("}
{"text":"Perhaps I am biased, but this lovely cafe is steps from my office and I know the chefs well. They strive to create better-than-regular meals from 6 AM - 2 PM everyday.

Notably, the build-your-own salad is of excellent value as well as the baked egg breakfast sandwich. For something quick, the spelt salad is excellent and they always have fresh-made muffins, cookies and a unique daily special. (My favorite is what I call 'hot dog day' which occurs on a rare Friday and includes a giant chili cheese dog with kettle chips... yum).

The cafe is small, so if you don't get there early, you will likely be taking your lunch to the nearby park on 12th & 9th. 

Highly recommended for a good lunch at good value!

{"text":"The ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen Cafe is really close to my office building and I go there often for lunch. Sometimes it is DELISH and sometimes it's just ok, but I can honestly say that I have never had a \"bad\" lunch there.

I sometimes find the Chefs Choice a little bit strange (turkey with cinnamon, olives and berries???) but on those days I go for the Build Your Own Salad. You get a choice between mixed greens and arugula (I go for mixed greens), several choices of protein (I take 4 good sized prawns), additional toppings and cheese (feta all the way!). The very best part is the price..... $7.50 for a meal sized salad! It would cost more to buy the ingredients and make it at home. So I won't..... I will keep visiting them here."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy the consistent high quality of the food in terms of taste and purity.  I enjoy the fact that they always have a Chef special but also many salads and sandwiches."}
