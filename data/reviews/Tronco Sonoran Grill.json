{"text":"Delish!  I have eaten there multiple times and the food is as good as the staff.  A wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Stopped in when they opened for lunch on a Friday as the first customers.  If you haven't read previous reviews it should known their salsa is served hot out of a crock pot.  I personally prefer cold salsa with chips fresh out of the oven, not the other way around but the wife really like them both.  I ordered the Carne Deshebrada Torta which was nice and flavorful, served with tomato/lettuce/red onion on the side with quartered red potatoes.  Wife ordered the half kale salad and enjoyed it. Dressing was quite spicy but good."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside, also empty. We went for advertised breakfast buffet& bloody Mary's. Were greeted by owner, we ordered 1 bloody Mary& 1 mimosa & 2 shots of tequila. We sat 6 minutes when the owner said he'd be back from store with Clamato because there out of Mary mix. He returned 10 mins later& said sorry, no Clamato or bloody Mary's. Ordered a margarita, after 23 minutes we got our mimosa& margarita. They forgot about the shots we ordered.  We asked server about buffet she had no idea, owner comes over says he'll make us breakfast???? We ordered off regular menu( since the buffet is nonexistent). Food was tasty, but soup served without spoon, we ordered 3 leneros dip, they did not bring chips!?  More disappointing happenings. We asked for to go boxes & our check, that took a good 15 mins. Oh my, food was good, but service is poor. Friendly they were, but unprofessional, no sense of urgency with anything. Really bummed, PISS POOR PERFORMANCE. Not recommend"}
{"text":"Nice mix of traditional and unusual items on the menu. We opted for something a little different - my husband had the beef empanadas and I had a chipotle pasta. Both were great!  Good flavor and plenty to take home for lunch tomorrow!  Restaurant interior is cute  too! Salsa has a kick to it - which I like !  My suggestion - Come and check out this great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if it were an option. Went the other night and was one of three tables there. Started by ordering an Arnold Palmer. After telling him what it is, he said they were out of ice tea. We ordered dinner, and I asked if he could bring some chips and salsa. He apologized and said they ran out.
After waiting 20 or so minutes for our meal, the waiter came over and said the kitchen was very busy and it would be awhile but dinner would be on them if we choose to wait. 3 tables with 2 people at each.....Really?? Told him we were not interested in waiting so he offered us a coupon to come back. We said no thank you as we would never be back. I think it is the same owner new name as it is just as bad.
We walked over to the little French restaurant Voila and had a fabulous dinner in the end."}
{"text":"Cool place with great happy hour apps and there margaritas are fresh squeezed and delicious. Great decor and awesome staff. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to the location on bell rd. We would go at least once a week. That placed closed down. We came to the one in Scottsdale thought this place would be top of the line. I don't know if their recipes are not the same or if they just completely changed chefs. My food was served cold. Waitress forgot one of our orders. This place had no A1 sauce or Tabasco. I'm definitely disappointed . I thought this place had a great start here in Scottsdale. I guess not."}
{"text":"Would give this place less than a star if it was possible. Me and my girlfriend are here last night, she had the street tacos( steak and chicken) and I had the fajitas. About and hour and a half to two hours later she was bent over the toilet violently throwing up and this lasted until the morning. She had nothing to eat for hours prior to eating there and was just fine all day. So I went back in to inform the manager that my girlfriend got food poisoning and all they could say was that they couldn't do anything about it and that they would need a hospital report stating that it was the steak that gave her the food poisoning. Well since it is now 12 hours later and she has violently vomited everything up that's going to be a little hard. They had poor service and clearly a dirty kitchen.  I would recommend that you stay far and clear away from this place."}
{"text":"Horrible....horrible....horrible the service and chips are awful. We didn't even get to order. No one was there but the service was still slow
I hope my post prevents someone from wasting time and money"}
{"text":"J.B. is an idiot, I have no connection to this restaurant but we had nearly the same meals the food is very good and the margaritas are good and inexpensive. Please don't listen to self absorbed little people that take great offense to the slightest perceived grievance.

We enjoy this restaurant and come often and will continue to."}
{"text":"We are in town from Salt Lake City and tried Leneros...we had a steak burrito and chicken enchiladas and were so pleased with our meals!! Nice atmosphere and friendly service...quality food and nice presentation. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"So disappointed arrived early in time for happy hour  took awhile to get our drinks and both had only a hint of alcohol. Chips poor choice ,tasted stale, did not mind warm salsa but get rid of those chips. My dinner partner got lamb , way too salty , my mahi  mahi over powered by sauce and over cooked. Veggies not bad   But overall so sad  as the meal and drinks disappointing-place is so nice inside, lovely decor  , and please ditch the canned Mexican music ...."}
{"text":"We live just down the street and had been anxiously watching as Lenero finished their patio area.  Once they opened we came and we're very very impressed.  My wife is a native of Mexico and the whole family loves their food.  Wife's favorite dish started out as the Chipotle Pene Pasta.... she still loves that but her new favorite is the fish tacos.  I prefer the Carne Deshebrada and the tortilla soup.  Wonderful place to eat inside and the patio is outstanding.
Service is great, the owner stops by and greets us, the staff is friendly and effective.  Five stars without qualification. Highly reccommended!"}
{"text":"House margarita is delicious! I ordered the cucumber and strawberry one and I loved it! They were also 2x1 that night which was awesome!

I recommend the chicken enchiladas also, they are very filling! I had never been to a restaurant where they serve you 4 of them, normally you get 2 and you're lucky if they do 3.  So that was a nice bonus! I did the half red sauce and half green sauce ones.  Very yummy!

Hubby ordered the ribs and these were also very tasty! 
Very meaty and the sauce had the perfect spice! 

Would definitely come back and try this place again!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and we're quite pleased. Our server, Liz, greeted us promptly and brought water, chips, and a great warm salsa. They have a good selection of beers on tap and specialty margaritas. I had the chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauces. The  dark red was made with guarillo chillies a very special tasty sauce. My husband had a brisket torta also very good. His side dish was grilled potatoes and mine was charro beans. The sides were included. We each had a beer. The total came to$25 which we thought was fair for the quality. If you tried this place earlier and weren't pleased, give it another try! We'll try it for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Paola was our server, and she was very attentive.

I knew what I was going to order as soon as I walked in.... Leñero Hambreado.  I love to cook, but I can't come close to duplicating this at home.  The lamb is so juicy, and has perfect heat.

We met the owner this time, he took me outside to show me the patio and let me know that they are having live music later.  Very friendly with my family, and my little son.  

Food was exactly as I expected.  Even the kids meal was great.... chicken/bean/rice bowl.  I miss that they don't have their Bell Road location, but it was absolutely worth the drive to Scottsdale.

Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 enchilada dinners and guacamole.  

Not crazy about chips and salsa.  Chips too heavy and warm salsa just not my thing.

Chicken enchilada in red sauce-  didn't really care for too much.  

Veggie enchilada in green sauce was pretty good. 

Guacamole:  pretty good but again the chips kinda didn't work for me

Pricing a little on the high end but we unknowingly got lucky and hit happy hour for enchiladas

Atmosphere was cute and felt like a like neighborhood place."}
{"text":"It's interesting that this restaurant is still on Yelp. I live down the street from this restaurant. They had and still have a huge banner hanging over the restaurant proclaiming it's new name
(It moved into the old Leneros restaurant) and grand opening date...August 13th and to my knowledge never did open. While I was at The Egg I Am next door I checked out a bright red sign on the door saying CLOSED. It was dated approx. Aug 24th ish. The sign was from the Arizona Maricopa Cty Inspector. The restaurant had been inspected earlier and was sent a cease and desist order for improper temperature (by about 10 degrees) in their freezer/ refrigerator units. When the inspector returned, the restaurant was operating even though they had the cease and desist order....the Inspector slapped a BIG RED CLOSED SIGN. What was that....open and closed for 1 week to 10 days? I'd like to know who the owners are so I don't eat at their new restaurant under new name."}
{"text":"Bad service, the waitress could not answer any of our questions. Two of the three items we decided on they were out of at 5:30 pm. I then ordered the enchiladas which were dry and flavorless, we also ordered the chicken Fajitas  there were 5 tiny pieces of meat. The chips were store bought and the salsa tasted of pure smoke.  The food was poor at best and over priced. Not a place i would recommend."}
{"text":"First time here, arrived at 5:30 and only one other table has customers. The interior is very quaint and appealing and the patio really is nicely done but the good ends there.
Sat down, waited for someone to come by (even though we basically the only ones here). Wife ordered the house margarita, terrible! Watered down no alcohol.
She orders the empanadas but 10 minutes later the waitress says \"no empanadas today, what else do u want\"

Still waiting ...... Where is the food??

Food arrives- it's so hot it's obvious it was microwaved.  Come with....side of lettuce leaf and two tomatoes. Did I order a burger???? So we ordered a side of rice and again comes out boiling hot from microwave 

My burrito was fair but my wife's green chile enchiladas were deplorable. 

So for a burrito, enchilada, side rice (since it's all ala carte even though they call it \"plate dinner\" and water down marg $32 plus tip nearly $40

Poor waitress was very sweet and we felt bad since she probably makes no $ in tips as nobody goes here.

Oh.. And the dessert I saw at Fry's grocery store. Trying to pass that off as homemade? Seriously.


Overall,This place is just a disaster and will be out of business shortly. Don't waste your time / money as its apparent nobody else does either.

Rough review? Yes but deserved. Not a care in the world on quality and client satisfaction."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time today for lunch and it was a huge disappointment.  The prices were very high in ratio to portion and quality.  I ordered the half kale salad and it was very very small and almost $12 once I added chicken.  They charged $5.75 for 3 little chicken strips.  Then it arrived with a different dressing than listed on the menu and they told me they don't have the dressing it comes with.  

The salsa was warm and bland.  It's a personal preference, but I like cold salsa.  My father's salad was missing the tortilla strips and my mothers enchiladas were ver small.  Three little enchiladas.  We wanted to order fajitas, but the lunch portion was $16.95 and then they charge $2.00 each for a tiny guacamole, sour cream, and cheese.  

The restaurant was empty, only us and 1 other table the entire time we were there from 11:45 to 12:30.  I'm not surprised.  They did remove the charge for my salad which I appreciated.  We also witnessed one gentleman come to place a take out order and get frustrated because everyone was walking around like they didn't know what to do for him.  Then a lady came for takeout and was contesting her order because they charged her $1.50 for a teeny little cup full (the size of something that a hospital would put a med in to give you)

The flavor of the food was average, the prices were sky high, and overall we were disappointed.  I'm giving 2 stars only because the staff was friendly to us and tried very hard and it wasn't their fault the prices were too high and the quality wasn't up to par.  

We won't be going back.  It's sad because there hasn't been a restaurant survive in this location and we were really looking forward to having a Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Looks great on the inside nice style and clean...service not so great. Apparently they don't know what ceviche is they brought out Mexican shrimp cocktail to be eaten with chips do they know that's a soup as in need a spoon. Had to get up and get our own water and limes for dos Equis ...."}
{"text":"Very disappointed having hoped this would be a nice addition to the neighborhood. We were the only patrons, food dry and served with no sides. We asked for sour cream to help with the dry taste and were hit for $3 for two dolups of sour cream. Expensive and poor quality...."}
{"text":"Recently opened Lenero's Mexican Grill and Cantina was a hit for us the food was delicious, all the meats are smoked over Applewood and the portions were huge.. We had the Smoked Ribs (1/2 slab filled a whole plate) and Fajitas and both were Amazing, the Margarita's are fresh squeezed and very tasty as well. Décor was very nice and they're building an outside patio for live music, can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened up in the Mercado shopping center, in a location in which many previous restaurants have tried and failed. Unless Leneros can significantly improve from the experience my wife and I had yesterday for lunch, they are doomed to the same sad ending.

The owners spent a potload of money on the decorations and design, including a huge patio in the back, which will be unusable in a month or so.

We came by for lunch, but it was late - at least for us. It was about 1:15 in the afternoon. There were only three other customers in the restaurant, and two of them were at the bar. I estimate the staff-to-customer ratio at that moment was about 3-to-1. Despite that, we stood at the entrance for several minutes before we were greeted.

I don't know about the other Lenero locations, but this one did not have a lunch menu, and so there were no less-expensive-for-lunch specials or anything like that - just the dinner menu. That makes this place a bit steep for lunch.

The menu is a bit limited, whether for lunch or dinner. There are lots of seafood options, however. 

The service was slow but good.

We were given chips and salsa for free. The salsa is kept warm in a crock pot. Although pretty tasty, warm salsa is not my favorite. The chips came from a large plastic bag at one of the bus stations - not hot out of the kitchen as at some other restaurants.

Many seats in the main dining area - including ours - give a view straight into the kitchen - not a view I really want while dining.

My wife ordered the enchiladas. About $15 which is, for lunch, a bit steep. They were tasty, but sadly (despite the fact that there were only two or three other customers), not hot (temperature). That's inexcusable.

I had the tacos on flour tortillas. Three, which I got assorted - two steak and one chicken. The steak was a bit chewy, but these were otherwise quite good - although a bit spicier than I like them.

My wife had a soda, and I had water. With tip, we paid $37.

The service was attentive and polite, although we occasionally had to wait to catch the eye of the server which shouldn't be necessary given the number of customers.

I don't think we'll go back.

{"text":"This place is outstanding.  The food is great, service by Javier was exceptional and it is a definite recommend and repeat place to go. Try the taco's on Tuesday.
Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is very warm and welcoming neighborhood Mexican place.  The atmosphere is delightful and so is the service and food.  The chips and salsa are so tasty.  The salsa is made in house and has a slight kick and scrumptious. My husband and I shared the enchiladas.  He had chicken and I had steak and we both had the green sauce.  Oh my!   The steak ones were hotter temperature wise but both were definitely worth a trip back."}
{"text":"I have been to many Mexican food restaurants all over the country. This ranks among the best. They have the best salsa I have ever had period -very smoky flavor. Margaritas are excellent and inexpensive if you get the Happy Hour house special. They have excellent bean dip and great guacamole.  My wife loved her enchiladas. The kids ate free and loved their food. The service is great and the decor is well done,warm and inviting. I have been here twice and loved it both times.   Salt and lime is just down the street and is packed and noisy. This place is way better!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat at Lenero's at around 4:45pm on a Saturday (for an early dinner) and we were the only diners in the place - understandably it was a bit early for dinner, but it was still a Saturday so I expected possibly a few other patrons. The food was okay, nothing tasted bad or gross by any means, although I've had better Mexican food. What I didn't like was that the proportions were weird... My plate consisted of 3 small tacos, and that was it. I did ask if the plate came with rice&beans and I was told it did not but could get it on the side, which I declined since I ordered an appetizer, however another member of my party ordered salmon. His plate consisted of a good sized piece of salmon with sauce, and exactly 3 (tiny) pieces of asparagus.... and thats it. Maybe its just me, but that seemed odd too..... I feel like at least his dish could have come with something on the side. The server was nice however took my plate and drink before I was finished with either. All in all, I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give it a try as it's really close to home.  As other review's have said, it is a little pricey for what you get, it's not real spicy (which was fine by me but not my husband), the chips are too thick.  The salsa is now cold and we enjoyed it.  I really liked my classic margarita which was listed as $9.  I asked if the \"hefe margarita\" was bigger as it was $12. He said no, but ignore all the prices. All of them were $6. What?  But hey, whatever.  We both had the beef enchiladas; mine with red his with green $14.  They were good but again, a little pricey.  The beans and rice were really good.  
Our server was a very nice eager to please young man.  We found out he was the manager which was kind of surprising as he didn't seem very experienced but I'm old.  We bought the $40 for $25 coupon and didn't use all $40.  He didn't know how to credit us the rest but bent over backwards to try and make it right.  He took the coupon with my name on it and posted it and told me when I came back he would honor the rest plus a little.  Not what I would've liked but hey very creative!  
There was one table when we got there and another when we left.  We were there on a wed afternoon at noon.  VERY quiet.  Cute patio but it's 110'. 
I'll probably stop by for my margarita but I doubt we'll eat there again just due to cost.  It's not that I NEEDED a bigger portion but I don't think I got my money's worth.  Would like a lower price not bigger size."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Started with the guacamole, it was like eating a raw onion. The fajitas came out cold with no sizzle. The chicken enchilada were the only saving grace."}
{"text":"This new place is amazing. The owner owns a farm where he gets all of the wood that makes up most of the decor in his restaurant. The Staff is very polite and the Street Tacos are the best! They are expanding the patio on the back to make the already spectacular ambiance even better. I recommend this place highly!!"}
{"text":"The margarita was delightful. The food, not so much. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The grilled skirt steak was neither tender nor tasty but the complimentary chips and salsa were good so I used the salsa to add some flavor to the meat. 

We have all been so excited to see a fresh new restaurant in our neighborhood. They have done such a great job with the decor and we were really hoping the food would be as good. Sadly, our first impression was not stellar.

The place was pretty empty when I was there and I feel bad for the owners. The first few months in a new place are so important for it's success and things just don't look all that hopeful.

We may try it again but right now, the thought of going back just makes me feel kind of sad.

Please, please, please turn things around. We really WANT to support a great restaurant in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"We'd become big time fans of Lenero's over on the west side, but it recently closed down, sadly, leaving the Scottsdale location as the only place in town to enjoy their amazing \"New Mexican\" cuisine. My personal favorite are the barbacoa tacos. They're spicy and the meat is so tender and more flavorful than any others I've had elsewhere. Their beans are excellent, and the chicken pasta is also a family favorite. They have a full bar and a great patio outside. They cook on applewood from their family ranch, and the care they take in preparing meals is surprising given how quickly the food comes out of the super clean kitchen. Worth the drive if you're not in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Visited leñeros with my boyfriend for the first time yesterday, we sat at the bar were greeted by the owner and got started with a house margarita (great choice!), Tom the bartender was knowledgeable and carried on an interesting conversation super pleasant guy, my boyfriend opted for the Plato leñador which comes with well seasoned shrimp, sweet and delicious ribs & rib eye strips, I had the rib eye a la parilla it came with ranchero beans, red potatoes, guacamole and asparagus, I couldn't be more pleased and needless to say this was amazing no complaints about the food or the service. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was so hopeful for a new restaurant in our neighborhood. The ambiance was great. I thought they did a great job remodeling the place. 
The food however left me disappointed. In general it lacked flavor. I hope that as time progresses that they will improve. It has amazing potential."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on 1/30, early in the evening. The service was terrible. The chips brought out at the beginning were old and hard. The entrees were not hot except for the fajitas. The server forgot one of the meals. Overall this was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom for Cinco de Mayo and was disappointed. There was no hostess at the front and we had to wait at least 5 minutes be seated even with many open tables. I asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks. What kind of bar doesn't have a blender? 
The chips were bland and the salsa was warm (on purpose) which was not refreshing. I can't imagine eating warm salsa here in the summer! I ended up ordering the chicken street tacos and my mom got the steak street tacos. Both were tasty and fifty percent off which slightly made up for the slow service and lack of blended margaritas. Overall won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"The street tacos are good but they need to start making their chips from scratch as the ones they use now are too thick and taste store-bought.

Also, serve all of your salsas cold. I don't think any locals enjoy warm salsa, especially while dining in the desert."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful, tasty and well-done theme. If you want to taste authentic Ranchero cuisine this it. The secret is in their wood BBQ for incredible flavor. So glad to have a local restaurant focused on healthy offerings, good prices, sublime cocktails and super friendly owners.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but very inexperienced. They did not know what a cadillac margarita was nor did they have it on the menu. Our Margarita was not very good. Food was okay but nothing special. Will not return."}
{"text":"My fiance and I dined at Lenero's on Friday evening and really enjoyed the whole experience. Arriving shortly after 7pm, we were seated immediately. It was a bonus that their margaritas were half off, as I had several spicy margs that were delicious. 

Chef Marcos greeted us at our table and was able to provide recommendations, given this was our first time there. He recommended the lamb to my fiancé, which was very good. I enjoyed an empanada with fresh veggies. 

We appreciated that everyone made an effort to make our dining experience personal - our server Alex, the chef, and the bartender Kevin were all very kind and accommodating. The ambiance was lovely, and we heard there will be live music in the summer evenings which will be something to look forward too!

At the end of the night, we left feeling full (but not heavy) and look forward to future visits at this local restaurant!"}
{"text":"So Troncos is now open. Chips and salsa are the best. The menu hasn't changed from Leneros to much, so if you liked the food before you can still count on it. Queso Fundido, Grilled shrimp, and Guac are still the best in Scottsdale. Live music on the weekends all in our back yard. I'll be back. QA"}
{"text":"Walked in around 1:20pm today and there were only 2 occupied tables. No one at the front desk, i walk over to the bartender who says I can sit anywhere, so I do. I waited for a little less than 10 minutes. Bartender helps one larger table, and there are no other servers to be seen anywhere. No one ever came to take my drink order. Im on a lunch break, so I left and went to Goldies."}
{"text":"New restaurant in the area I decided to give a try, great atmosphere, very rustic chic decor, not your everyday Mexican restaurant. Service was excellent, the drink was fantastic, if the rest are as good as what I had, can't wait to try. The food was out of this world, I had the Mahi - Mahi with  grilled esparagus and cilantro rice. Will definitely come back."}
