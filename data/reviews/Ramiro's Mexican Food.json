{"text":"We finally found THE \"Berto's\" place for us in this neck of the woods (although it's technically not a Berto's... whatever...) Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the semi-crappy exterior usually speaks volumes about the food (in a good way)... there's something a little unsettling about a bright and friendly looking Berto's. ANYWAYS we went to this place last night. They had a lot of stuff on their menu that isn't on some other \"Berto's\" menus... like the 5 rolled taco supreme that my fiance got... rolled tacos, covered in everything that comes on super nachos (carne, sour cream, cheese, salsa... OH MY) - awesome. I got the bean and cheese burrito, which was also delicious. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I come here for the tacos de cabeza I think they are the best that I've tried so far.. the chicken tacos are also good."}
{"text":"Place sucks over the years it has just got to be more and more shit the meat sucks tortillas have a funny texture and taste it use to be good 8-10 years ago but now forget it I attempted one last time thinking maybe it was the workers there or something so I tried it again and hell no it still sucks just straight up garbage I don't recommend this crap to anyone even there salsa is crap and they over charge for the crap meat and no sour cream or hardly any cheese on the Carne asada fries like really they use to fully load that now just crap"}
{"text":"I shouldn't expect much from late night eating, but it's Mexican food. It should be good whatever time of day. However, I ordered menudo due to a heavy hangover. Maybe this was from the bottom of the pan because over half of it was just bones. My dogs will be happy. The menudo broth was not very tasty. Missing the seasonings, such as salt. They provided lemon, cilantro, and onions but no ground oregano.   FYI- the guacamole and chips were not kid friendly. This is my kids' favorite item. The guacamole had visible tomatoes in it. My kids said nah. I'll stick with my Juliobertos, Filibertos, and Herreras."}
{"text":"This place took some guts to stop at, but it was well worth it. Small location that most people would just pass up for a fancier Taco-Shop! Super elaborate menu with options for everyone. I kept it simple with some beef, chicken, tongue tacos! The tortillas were a bit smaller and more doughy than I am used to, but were great. All the meats had great flavor. Not too salty, not too greasy.... My wife really enjoyed her Shrimp Cocktail! Step outside your comfort zone and give this place a try!   *****NO FIREARMS ALLOWED*****"}
{"text":"Ok, I used to go here all the time. I would get toquitos with chicken but I'm a vegetarian now. I thought maybe they could make them with cheese only. After I miss the speaker I pulled straight up to the window and proceeded to get bitch out for not using the speaker. I then asked if I could order them with only cheese and avocado she said yes but they had meat so I took them back and she refused to refund me and gave me no apology & was argumentative. I settled for a bean burrito but she acted so pissed off I decided not to eat it. I wont be going back, ever!"}
{"text":"I been to this place twice in the past two months and I'm done! They skimp on everything! Today I bought two carne Asada, burritos and paid 14.00 for them and all I got was two onion burritos with a side of meat! To top it off the meat was hard and old/over cooked! Last time my son and I went there we got the carne Asada chips and they skimped on that too!  I will never go back best believe! This Ramiro's is nothing like the one on Litchfield and Van Buren! That one is bomb! Good, always fresh and they give you what you pay for! I don't know if they are hurtin for money so they decide to rip folks off but yeah you just lost 2 customers and not to mention any of my friends and family! I will definitely let them no not to go here unless you want to be ripped off!"}
{"text":"Found fries in my breakfast burrito, my sons burrito had huge chunks of oily bacon very disappointed. Got my money back never gonna eat there again! Rather go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Ramiro's- especially the one on 107th indian school, has not been making me happy. For the past two visit's, my burritos that I order for my boyfriend and I, the tortilla's are nearly burnt and hard when you bite into it. They hired this new lady, and she's very unprofessional behind the register and on the phone. I'm not trying to bash Ramiro's because for over a year now, I always loved there food and the great costumer service I get from this older lady (I forgot her name) she wears glasses, but she is just the nicest lady. But my point is, Ramiro's isn't the same without her and the other cook. I've experienced better! and the new Lady needs to clean the tables good, she just sweeps the crumbs, the tables are very sticky!"}
{"text":"The food may be good, but the staff and service stink.  I have come here a couple of times since they are open 24 hours.  I went to the drive thru and sat there for 10 minutes with no acknowledgment, so I decided to go in.  I had to wait another 5 minutes to order.  The cashier then overcharged me for my food. When I complained the cashier made it be known how inconvenient it was.  As i sat to wait for my order, the staff began speaking in Spanish about my order.  (I know Spanish) While I didn't catch everything that was said,  it was enough for me to throw away my food as I walked out the door from an uneasy \"they probably spit in the food\" feeling."}
{"text":"I eat out alot and I am getting very tired of going out to restaurants like this and getting food poisoning. I ordered the Chimichanga plate #17 and my wife ordered a California burrito. Neither of us could eat even half of our meals. I tried, but could tell if I continued eating I would end up getting sick. I did. I got food poisoning and it is very upsetting. My wife also is sick but not as bad as me. Next time we will go to Caramba's. They have the best Mexican food in the area. We will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I asked the lady about their omelettes. She said ham or sausage. I said cheese, just cheese. She says they can't do that.....I was stunned. I asked her if the the ones with sausage/ham had cheese. She says yes. I again asked her why they could not hold the meats and make it with just cheese? She starts telling me how they make an omelette. The cook meanwhile is looking through the opening and shaking his head. After her lesson on how to make an omelette I convinced her to make me a plain cheese omelette. I asked her if it came with rice,beans, and potato wedges. She says no potatoes but I could side order them for two bucks. I say OK, 2 orders please, to go. I get home and there was a flat egg crape was folded over with a little dribble of cheese over it all on top of rice and beans. In a styrofoam boat was a small order of fries (two bucks), all of which tasted like yesterdays oil. Before I left I asked for my soda cups. She says the platters don't come with sodas. Wow. Pretty bad quick order mexican food. Easily beaten out by any other of their competitors.Worst  eighteen bucks I ever spent. I won't be back. Who owns this place??"}
{"text":"This is a no frills delicious place to get some quick mexican food. The food authentic and fresh and I have never diliked anything i have gotten there. You can't go wrong. The salsa bar is only okay and i am a salsa whore so this but this is probably a big point for a great mexican place."}
{"text":"Super legit Mexican food. Better than other local chains ending in \"o's\".   Great prices. Regular chicken burrito is like $5.02 with tax.  Eat here about once a week for the past 6 months. Had about every burrito and platter on the menu. Can't really go wrong. Adobada is a little greasy for my taste but coworkers and friends have enjoyed it.  Personal favorite burritos: regular chicken, california."}
{"text":"Who would ever expect one of those 24 hour burrito joints to be so damn good ?  Well this place is .... I have never had a bad burrito here ever ... ive been stopping here now and again for years ...carne asada, machaca, choreso all amazing tacos the flying saucer the nachos ... you all catch my drift ... The place is clean priced right and never closes !! Mucho bueno !!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never paid attention for this restaurant, but my friend invited me there, you never get disappointed on how great and tasty their food is!   Their breakfast burritos are super wow! We ordered couple more stuff, try their carne asada! It's about fries and beef plate with some sour cream and something else; anyways it's f***ing delicious!   & great service..."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos you will find!! Very reasonable priced. Big portions. Friendly staff. The location looks kinda sketchy but it's not a bad place. I've tried a couple other Ramiro's and this one certainly has the best food and the cheapest pricing! I am addicted to their breakfast burritos! Love love love this place!! Red salsa rocks!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I warn you - don't go! It's addicting. You will dream about it and keep going back.. frequently. Food is out of this world"}
{"text":"Right across the street, literally, from a Filibertos and I will ALWAYS choose Ramiro's.  Hands down better customer service, food and pricing.  This place makes you feel like you're sitting across the table from familia. You never make it through the door without being greeted with a \" hola mijo/mija\".  Every bite of food tastes like it was prepared with love and care regardless of what you choose from the menu.  My wife and I have eaten here multiple times but today she ventured away from her norm and added a quesadilla, she literally cried after taking the first bite.  This tastes just like the ones my Nana used to make me, I love this so much, this quesadilla has got me right in the feels."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos on Bell Rd. I've been coming here for over 1 year, made fresh when you order with quality ingredients you can taste."}
{"text":"First time to the place & it is an Awesome place for breakfast.  We ordered machca & eggs.  The corn tortillas were soft & warm, the rice was a little dry, the beans were flavorful & the machaca was full of veggies, beef & flavor. It wasn't soggy or greasy & the veggies were cooked just right.    Only giving 4 stars since this is our first visit but we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I am a lover of the 24 hour burrito places. Really I am, and given the fact this is the one that happens to be closest to me I am always disappointed that this place isn't better. I have NEVER, in the 10 or so times I've been here, ever gotten my order 100 percent correct. Either they forget my guacamole, or give me sprite instead of mountain dew, the list goes on. In Phoenix we are absolutely lucky with these types of places and I suggest for you to skip this one. I drive 5 miles down the road to pick up my burritos at 4 a.m. I just can't justify suggesting a place that never has gotten my order right. The only thing that is making this a 2 star and not a 1 star is the food is actually pretty good. Not better then some of the other \"urtos\" out there and they do undercook the potatoes but other than that they are good. Not great. Meh."}
{"text":"Without a doubt... this place serves up THE BEST breakfast burritos in the entire US. It's the tortilla... the tortilla is just perfect."}
{"text":"We couldn't find a menu online so my wife called and asked a couple questions.  Apparently, we annoyed the employee as she hung up on us on our second question, saying she \"didn't want to deal with this\"."}
{"text":"Needed a breakfast burrito fix and seen the great reviews about them here at Ramiro's (thanks to Yelp)  So I decided to place an order to go, since I don't have the luxury of going inside to eat anymore, since I have a little one that would rather bounce around a restaurant then sit down like a civilized human being.  Anywho, the place was a little hard to find, but I managed (thanks to Yelp) for having a built in gps system. It's a small hole in the wall tucked in between other businesses in a outdated strip mall. I didn't mind, just wish they had a drive up window for people like me.  No biggie, I was in and out in a minute. So now to the food... I ordered the egg, bacon, cheese burrito with add in potato. I wanted to try the one with sausage so I ordered that one too. The bacon was the winner. These burritos are big enough to split and you'll still feel satisfied. I liked the green homemade salsa with mine. The red salsa was too much on the herby side to mesh well with the eggs and potatoes. Overall I really enjoyed my experience and I would go back when I need another breakfast burrito fix."}
{"text":"Great customer service !!!! The lady that works here is such a sweetheart !!!! Muy amable Ella.... I had a adobada burrito it was  good! They serve aloot of food... Big meal !!! Good taste!!!!"}
{"text":"Scary location , dirty and marginal food. My chimi was barely fried.  Nothing like having hipsters  hitting  you up for money in the parking lot. will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but could use a bit more seasoning. Prices are what makes this place a good value. Could also use a good cleaning, especially in the restrooms."}
{"text":"Its a 24hour joint it does the job it feeds your tummy -Meh. I've experienced much better food. The place is run down it def. needs a make over. The tacos are my favorite there I give them a 4/5. other than the fish tacos i feel as though the food is bland and the salsa is waterie just a pathetic excuse for Mexican food... sad day for Mexican food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food. Breakfast burritos are good, including the chorizo. Fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"I asked for a bacon potatoes egg and cheese burrito.... I ate 1/4 of my buritto, eggs, cheese, and huge pieces of ham??? Like huge, that wasn't bacon.... no potatoes.... I don't understand how hard it is to make this burrito.... I'd suggest going to the other place down the street on 35th ave... this place always screws up my order... oh and their veggie burrito is soup in a tortilla...."}
{"text":"The California breakfast burrito was a perfect combination of pico potato cheese and steak. Perfect for a hangover. I will not order the carne Asada taco salad again because it was extremely salty. I think it's because I got carne Asada though so I may try a taco bowl again but get steak or chicken instead. Then if all that fails I will just go for the breakfast burrito. I just love all the toppings on the tAco salad, it has just a little bit of everything in a fried taco bowl shell. I will be back here!"}
{"text":"This very simple eatery is a great place for tasty Mexican food. The prices are low and the service is fast. I tried their taco and enchilada platter and was very satisfied with what I got. The crispy taco had juicy carnitas as the default filling, and the cheese enchilada, rice, and beans were good - especially the beans which tasted like they used lard, which is the way it should be. The salsa bar offers the standard red and green salsas, plus radish slices, hot (really!) pickled carrots and jalapenos. The drive-though is open 24 hours, which means I now have a good place to go when I get my late-night cravings for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I work odd hours so we will make a stop here anywhere between 11pm - 430am.   The service has always been awesome, and the food has always been good. Maybe it's the difference in shifts??   I will agree to the greasiness, but that's kind of expected for a hole in the wall place. Our usual is the chorizo and egg burrito, like someone said its a good portion."}
{"text":"We went here specifically because people were raving about the breakfast burritos and we're totally underwhelmed. These were the skimpiest breakfast burritos. Potatoes were add ons. WTH, potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito. Check out my pics of a ham, egg & cheese but they forgot the pico de gallo & the sausage burrito with potatoes added didn't have any potatoes or pico de gallo. I guess we caught them on a bad day or right when they opened or something."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is good. Clean. People are nice. Always come here for carne asada burritos. Never had a bad meal. Green salsa is bomb."}
{"text":"Went on a late Saturday morning. Ordered a breakfast item - Chorizo Burro and a lunch/dinner item - Chili Relleno Plate. I wanted to see if it was worth the drive for future visits in one stop.  The chorizo burrito was very good. It has more seasoning than the \"-berto\" style joints in a 5 mile radius. I like this fact. WIll go back for breakfast. The Chili Rellenos were the same as the others. I would not go back for the rellenos...but the fact that the burro was so good I would try another menu item if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy their beef  chimichanga huge .... And their appetizers the jalapeño and carrots is to die for"}
{"text":"Excellent food that is well prepared and authentic.  More than one step above the local ...Bertos.  Friendly people.  Sometimes it seems to take as long as it does to get your food in Mexico but the food is well worth the wait and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This little place has the best breakfast burritos. We always place a to go order of bacon,egg,potato and cheese burrito. They are always very accommodating because their burritos are so big that we have them cut and wrap them in half.  Very friendly staff always willing to strike up a conversation. The restaurant itself is always very clean."}
{"text":"I just had their carne asada torta, off the hook!! The taste was amazing, the carne asada was high quality, and grilled with perfection. The best I have tasted in Avondale. So lucky to have them near by !!!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here stuffing my face with the rolled tacos supreme. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? They are really really good. I was over at the dealership and looked on Yelp to find somewhere to pick up some food. I saw that this place only had 4 reviews, and Filibertos had 23. I think Fili's is...meh so I tried here instead. I was hoping for a drive thru, and got one. Can't rate it any higher because this is the only menu item I've tried. Very delicious though!"}
{"text":"Love this place they are friendly and the food is awesome I'm a regular. Never been sick."}
{"text":"Divey Whole in Wall alert.  Solid Mexican Foods to eat on the run. I especially  love the Chorizo and Egg burrito.  It  is a generous portion of egg and greasy chorizo wrapped in a  fresh flour tortilla.  The Bean and Cheese Burrito is very tasty too and generous in portion as well.   While not much to look at, it is no frills and the service is good. Food is made fresh and it  has great flavor.  Don't expect to anything but good basic mexican food for a fast and easy price."}
{"text":"Thank you Ramiro's. Thank you for so many things. Thank you for being so nice and professional on the phone call I placed this morning for a take out order. Thank you for not judging my voice (even though I sounded like the scary voice from those horrible \"Scream\" movies). Thank you for cooking up some of the best dang Menudo this side of Yuma. Thank you for not running away scared when my hung-over self walked into your fine restaurant looking like a backup for The Walking Dead pilot episode. Finally, thank you for being you, for existing, and only being a seven minute drive away from my den of recovery on this St. Patrick's Day weekend... I love you."}
{"text":"You should definitely be armed when you go but the food is worth the risk. Carne asada fries are to die for and the salsa is good too. Not watered down like a lot of places."}
{"text":"Been coming here for at least 8 years now.   A friend and I started the little \"car show\" about 4 years ago, got them a lot of business!  I always get their carne asada burritos with no pico and rice/beans on the side.   They don't screw up my order and I've never gotten sick eating there."}
{"text":"Best steak rancheros I've ever had! Comes with 2 fried eggs on top, 4 total tortillas (2 flour or corn and 2 corn tortillas make the base of the entree), rice, and beans with cheese n two tortilla chips for some reason lol. All the food I've tried so far has been good or better. It all has that delicious good quality taste. Something this place does different is that if you order an agua fresca, you put as much or as little ice as you want into your cup and then hand it back to the employee to fill it up with the agua fresca. This place has better food than the Filiberto's across the street and lower prices! I've been going here everyday for breakfast/lunch lol"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get burritos.  always greeting you once you walk in. the owners are so sweet and caring makes it perfect to stop by and get food. never had a problem with them."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here about 7 times since moving to the area 3 months ago. Very good customer service and super family friendly. The food I awesome, I like the tamales and chimichanga."}
{"text":"This place sucks!  Everything comes out super greasy, the lady at the drive thru never wants to hand over extra red and green sauce and the place is very dirty.  I've been here a few times, but never again!  New Federico's opening on 43rd & Union Hills and I can't wait!  Goodbye Ramiro's."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the last several times we ordered here.   We get the Bean and Cheese burros Super Nachos  Both have better taste then the bertos around the way.   Watch your drive thru though....missing items!"}
{"text":"I was eating my shrimp burrito, which was delicious. Halfway through I glanced across the floor to see a big cockroach running around. Needless to say, my appetite was done for. Good recipes, kind people, obviously not clean though."}
{"text":"Ramiro's was barely okay. Not terrible. But certainly far from great. But with sooooo many other choices in the area it's tough to find a reason to go back. I will say that their assortment of combinations was pretty good. One featured and enchilada and a chile relleno - a combination I've not often seen. Alas, the chile was probably the worst I've ever had. But I gave it a shot!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ramiro's since last October when a friend of mine said, hey lets grab a breakfast burrito! OMG! it was so good! Packed full of yummy goodness to the point that I have been back many times just for the breakfast burritos alone. Fast track to their nachos, regular burritos, tacos, you name it, I have tried it and it was delicious. Like Ashley said, this place isn't a \"Berto's\" by any means, they are better! I have and will continue to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision after a long night returning from a soccer match in Tempe/Scottsdale. While driving home last at night my options were minimal, but after deciding what Mexican spot to for a drive-thru experience Ramiro's came up right away! I can honestly say it has been a minute since I have made a visit. For some reason menudo just sounded right! The location is kind of hidden north of Bell Road, so don't drive over 50 mph or guarantee you will miss it! I like the fact that this location has menudo all day and night, 7 days a week. Who else does? Anyhow I was once again satisfied with my tasteful red menudo complimented with corn tortillas, cilantro, chopped onions and limes to mix to my soupy dream!"}
{"text":"Good if you have a case of the munchies. Don't expect food that'll blow you away... And don't order the chicken. It isn't very tasty at all. I think they use white and dark meat, and me not being a fan of dark meat doesn't help. But this review gets 4 stars because the guy at the drive thru is a sweetheart. Can't help but smile whenever I see him."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. If there was a ZERO star option available, I would confidently select that. I visited this \"business\" yesterday evening and ordered a carne asada burrito in the drive-thru. I got home and the burrito was super salty. I was also treated badly by the guy at the window and, of course, he was the person I had to deal with when I called. He was super rude but told me to come back and he would remake the burrito for me. I got back to the location and he pretended that he had no clue who I was and \"didn't know who I had spoken to.\" Nice try buddy. After about 5 minutes of banter, they finally remade the food for me. He then threw the finished burrito on the front counter and rolled his eyes at me. I will NEVER revisit this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there with my love and got sick plus the food was not that great. It was kinda pricy. Also, the waiter was awkward and started to ask if i was Muslim and i don't eat pork just coz i look middle eastern. WHAT A BAD EXPERIENCE . Never eating there again"}
{"text":"I was hungry and in the area during lunchtime.  After a quick search on the Yelp app, I found this place.  It's a dive Mexican joint offering street Tacos and Burritos.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the Prize Claw machine....these things are everywhere now, what's the deal with that?  Anyway, back to the food....since I'm rarely in this area I decided to try a couple of items:  Bean & Cheese Burrito, $3.75 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=RRp-4xY9uBuTEliMx6JUVA#RRp-4xY9uBuTEliMx6JUVA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=AowjfEJkRsLVmQqrZW4R9A#AowjfEJkRsLVmQqrZW4R9A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=Vv_y6-9lSKlBwAwULmgK0Q#Vv_y6-9lSKlBwAwULmgK0Q  Carne Asada Taco, $1.35 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=Al2QHYAViDvTXh_hkFizQg#Al2QHYAViDvTXh_hkFizQg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=lBu9D7gzrZfL8zLIwC-Ynw#lBu9D7gzrZfL8zLIwC-Ynw  The Bean & Cheese Burrito was very good.  The Tortilla & Beans tasted fresh and was not greasy.  The Tacos were simple street Tacos....Carne Asada Steak, Cilantro, Onions, Corn Tortillas....these were very good as well.  Overall, it's a pretty good Mexican food joint....wish it was closer to my neighborhood.  Return Factor - 87%"}
{"text":"I used to live close to this location and I'd get Carne asada fries at least once a week. The same 2 guys were always working. They always provided great customer service and quality food. I would have given those guys the highest rating. Unfortunately, I moved away so Ive only had a chance to go 3 times in the last 2 years and those guys were not there. Each time I've gone there has been a rude Hispanic woman working. Her attitude and unprofessionalism wouldn't be enough to deter me from coming again or cause me to write this negative review; However, I have had a terrible experience with my food all 3 times I've gone. The first time, I found a whole rubber band in my Carne asada fries. I took them back with the rubber band still in it and got a refund. I waited a couple months before going back and when I did I found a broken rubber band in my Carne asada fries. I couldn't believe that happened to me again. I mean, they were either doing that to me on purpose or are extremely dirty and careless in the kitchen. The woman refused to give me a refund and said they'd remake it. I ended up just leaving without my money or food because I don't trust people to remake my food especially when I can't physically see into the kitchen. It had been almost a whole year before I finally went back. I figured they'd have different employees by then but I was wrong. I ordered my Carne asada fries anyway. While eating them I noticed a lot of little black flakes but didn't think anything of it until I found a bigger piece and realized it was plastic. There were pieces of black plastic in my food! I didn't even complain this time I just threw my food away in front of her and left. I will NEVER go there again. I don't know what is going on in that kitchen but it is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Authentic food and well priced. Always very nice. I always get the chicken enchiladas and buy extra hot sauce they they are always willing to jus give it to me instead of paying for it."}
{"text":"Came to this place after searching on Yelp for good places for quick Mexican food and after reading reviews and looking at the pictures, I decided to try this spot out.  On arriving at location, I was a bit skeptical to try the food out as the place from the outside is old and not inviting at all. I may have mistaken the place as being shut down if I had come during times they were closed down. Also, there were only two other cars parked, so wasn't sure if that was an indication of the quality of service and food offered here.  The inside of the restaurant is also old. Tables look like they haven't been updated or replaced since they first opened. The walls and floors are also dirty and old. Everything about the place is old, dirty and outdated. Smell of the place isn't inviting neither, but despite all that, I decided to try the food out.  I decided to order the Carna Asada burrito and my guest got the bean and cheese burrito along with a cheese quesadilla. I ordered a small drink, but was given a large one. Big negative for this place is the fact that the lady at the register didn't even ask what drink i wanted and just gave me a Pepsi, which I don't like or drink!!   On the other hand, the Carna Asada Burrito was amazing!! The meat was tender and full of flavor. Just the perfect amount of guacamole and pico de gallo to tie the burrito together. Was a pretty good size as i had to cut it in a half and take home part for another meal.   Bean and cheese burrito was just okay. Was told that it was pretty much the same that you could get at Taco Bell. Cheese quesadilla was almost too much too eat. Cheese tasted like fake cheese and was too rubbery to even eat!! After tasting it, I almost got sick. Will never have that again, or probably anything with cheese in it from this place.  Will come back again to try something else, but have decided that I'll only use the drive through."}
{"text":"The food has always been good but had a less than desired event occur. Once I walked in and order a drink and a roach crawled right across the counter. Granted it's been a year since. I haven't eaten food thier ever since. It's too bad because their breakfast burritos and bean & cheese were always on point. Now I have to start trying other places because of it."}
{"text":"I knew I was going to have a great burrito this morning. But not what I expected I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito with extra egg, but not what I expected too much egg and very little chorizo you cant even taste the chorizo. A waste of my money."}
{"text":"Just had the shrimp quesadilla and myyy goodness was I impressed. I ordered it thinking I would only get 5 shrimp and a ton of cheese, but that was not the case. There was a good amount of shrimp in there and it was delicious. The owners are also very humble and good people. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Got the .99 tacos. Had beef, chicken, fish. Fish was the best of the three. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Yum! We got breakfast burritos from here and they were sooooo good! The green salsa is amazing! And the woman who took our order was so nice and friendly! Will def be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"My bf even agreed this place is 5 stars. We ordered the california burrito, 3 bean and cheeses burritos and the 5 rolled taco supreme. We are almost all of it. So good. Very hole in the wall"}
{"text":"I would not come here if my bf hadn't brought me but, dang! The food is so good! I admit, the outside does not attract too much people but the food makes up for it.  i got my food in decent time, hot and ready to eat. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it negative reviews.. I called to ask if they were open and the man said yes so I drove over there. I asked for carne Asada fries with sour cream and cheese only. He asked me to repeat it so I did 5 times even at the window. He hardly spoke any English or understood what I was saying. My mistake, I had my friend check the bag and she said the order was good. We got back to the house and get this.. there was NO sour cream! So we drive back and tell him and he did not believe me. He said he made sure he put sour cream so I gave him my food. He apologized and instead of making a new order like he should have, He PUT SOUR CREAM ALL ON TOP OMG. I did not get my money back, and it was too soggy to eat. Safe to say I won't be eating there again lol. He was nice tho."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, very clean and fresh and delicious. Even with my custom orders everything is always perfect. Great family owned restaurant. Love the chicken tacos. All of them are great also the chorizo and carne."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and had high hopes for this place. I ordered carne adada tacos and cheese enchiladas. The tacos were ok, but there was nothing special about them, and definitely not worth the price. The enchiladas were the real disappointment. The cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought. It is sad to say that I have had better enchiladas from the frozen food aisle."}
{"text":"Love this tiny gem. It's delicious and authentic Mexican food. I adore the fact that they have salsas out with lines and radish! My favorite thing to get had to be the lengua tacos and a tamale on the side. Most of the week when you order the mini tacos they come with two tiny tortillas with more than enough filling. I usually get four or five and spread the filling to the extra tortillas.   They're also open 24/7 which is great."}
{"text":"Been eating there for a few years, they are very kind hearted people & the customer service is always great. The beef could be a bit higher quality, but other than that, highly recommended for great quality Mexican food on the go."}
{"text":"Any place that will host this buzzed and slightly obnoxious individual around midnight on a Sunday is fine by me. You know what I order half the time I have the munchies? Carne Asada. I'll eat it on or in pretty much anything. And at Ramiro's, it really packs a punch. Loaded with onions and what I *swear* is HORSERADISH in their guacamole, it was spicy and refreshing. It made me shut up and focus the last of my brain cells on telling the world why they should give it a try as well.  I'm telling you, it might sound simple, but this is some innovative fast food. I'll be back to see what else Ramiro's has up their sleeve...that is, if I come here during normal hours and eat something else.   PS--the aguas frescas don't suck"}
{"text":"This place is a happy surprise, it is very easy to overlook amidst all the \"bertos\" when you walk in it smells like home, very clean. The food is ok and reasonably priced. I'm not Mexican but I enjoyed the food and the bottled soft drinks."}
{"text":"Been here before quite some time ago probably for a burro.  Came in today just for menudo. I won't be back for it again.  Before I could taste a spoonful I had to skim out quite honestly about 1/4 cup of oil/fat first. It literally filled the little styrofoam cup the onions/cilantro come in.   They don't clean the tripe, each piece had a layer of gooey fat on it.  Spoons were itty bitty, especially if your bowl had the pata."}
{"text":"Just got a quick bite from this place. A no frills, down to business, 24 hour  taco, burritos, enchiladas, chilerellenos... the staples.   I got the enchildas and chile rellenos combo with a side or rice and beans. I had the pleasure of watching the person who took my order also cook my food, and not even bother to use a pair of gloves (minus one star). But the food was slightly greasy but really really good. The restaurant was otherwise clean, and they had a condiment bar with green and red salsa, pickled red radish, carrots and chilli's with fresh lemon wedges.    Perfect compliment to any meal.   This is a fast food joint, and they did a fast, and good job with the food.  I'm going to try the heuvos rancheros next time I'm there."}
{"text":"The rolled tacos were pretty good, but I have never seen a greasier bean and cheese burrrito."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, at least it is way better than Federico's and to a certain extent filibertos. The chorizo burrito is great just has a little too much tortilla for the amount of filling you get. The chile relleno plate was also pretty good, you get one more chile relleno than I am used to getting in texas. The only problem was that the plate was covered in lettus, so much lettus I had a hard time finding the chiles. I was also not happy with the prices, a little high for a fast food mexican place, it might just be the Arizona economy changed since the 5 years I've been gone. Other than that, it's a pretty good little mexican place plus it's only half a mile from my home so I got that going for me."}
{"text":"Their chorizo burritos are delicious, and the tortillas are brought in from a local bakery. The carne asada fries are good, but Poliberto's in Glendale wins on the fries.   I like the rolled tacos here as well... They are rolled small so they aren't filling up with a ton of oil when being fried.   I've always had good service here, and we are here often.  Yes- it's a little run down...but it's clean."}
{"text":"If I am giving it 4 stars I like it, and it is consistently good, be it 11 am or 11pm. Check it out price comparison vs Mc D's # 3 taco and enchilada 8.10 vs double qtr pounder value large 8.65. You'll be more full at Ramiros....aint  b.s.ing  the food is good. Don't wanna wait phone ahead, after developing a repor it'll be ready and hot. My pico degallo kicks theirs in the ass, but I cant expect theirs to contain the love and attention I put into mine. So anyway I highly freakin recommend this joint you want it real you get it real all day or all night."}
{"text":"I love mexican food and was craving rolled tacos with guacamole and chicken chimichanga. I decided to go try Ramiros. I was very unsatisfied with the food. There was no taste  to the food at all. The guacamole tasted watery and bland. When i cut the chimichanga open the chicken was cold and no season or salsa on it at all. very disappointed in the quality of the food. The salsa in the cups were all one piece n chunky not liquid at all. great customer service but food was bland."}
{"text":"Rolled Taco Supreme is pretty awesome, 5 rolled tacos with carne and all the trimmings on top! Guac is pretty good!   Had to deduct a star because they don't have al pastor tacos. WTF? They do offer some tongue, head, and a few other \"parts\" that most of the 'berto's don't - so if you are after that, then you may add the star back on.  The meat was a bit under-seasoned, and the salsas are not nearly spicy enough - but that's par for the course these days - so I won't dock them on wimpy salsa - that's why I have dozens of hot sauces in my fridge.  Mexican Cokes in the fridge, menudo on weekends - plenty of mexi-seafood fare if you are craving that. Worth checking out if you are in the area and want to try something just a bit different than the 'bertos."}
{"text":"Very clean. Staff is very nice and helpful. The food is great. Never had a bad meal. I am a regular at this place. Chorizo burrito for breakfast and carne asada burrito for dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the Torta, it was decent, there was not a lot of meat on it.  If I come back I won't order the Torta again"}
{"text":"Ramiro's food was good... not great.. just good. We'll definitely be back.  It's nice to support a locally owned establishment.    Only minor complaint is that the pico was VERY heavy on the cilantro. Certainly not a bad thing for someone who enjoys cilantro."}
{"text":"I sit here with an upset stomach after eating my food. I was DISGUSTED by my food to the point where I couldn't finish. I've been here a few times and at best it's OK. And I hadn't tried it in a while thought I'd give it another try. I hadn't eaten anything all day because I've been so busy and they are open 24 hours so why not. I ordered the number 7 which is 2 beef burritos with rice and beans, I order mine with chicken instead of beef. The smell coming from the bag wasnt the most pleasant, but I proceeded to eat it anyways. Bad idea. The chicken was overcooked and chewy. I kept picking chicken BONES out of my burrito. That's right BONES. Not just a small gristle of bone that made its way through, like dime size pieces of bone. Also, I had to pick out the fat too. (mind you I only ate half of 1 burrito. Moments later my burritos busted open and spewed the nastiest oily crap out of My burrito and all over my shorts. That was after I tipped my burrito upside down and took as much of the excess liquid I could. There was at least a good 4 ounces of mystery liquid in my burrito. I couldn't even get halfway through one. Trying to be somewhat positive, I thought, Hey, at least the rice and beans will stick to my gut and fill me up. Mistake number 2. Over seasoned and just tasted funky. I am not one to typically give enough of a shit to post a review on bad food nor not eat it. I'm kind of disgusting how strong my gut is and I just couldn't pallete it. I will NEVER go back there. How can you royaly fuck up everything on my plate so bad? I mean rice and beans is the most simple thing to not fuck up. I still haven't. Mentioned their hot sauce which was also trash, but that at LEAST had some redeeming qualities I believe someone else MIGHT enjoy. I'd rather take my lazy ass to a grocery store and eat a bag of saltines for a meal than come back to this establishment. Seriously, step your game up. There are plenty of. Actual burrito joints in the area I would gladly go to. After that horrible of a food experience I would applaud you guys going out of business and not subjecting anyways else to that less than half ass attempt at food. Shame shame shame.   On a side note. My favorite burrito Joint is RICARDOS of of 59th. Bomb. I urge you to please give your business to someone other than these incompetent \"cooks\"."}
{"text":"Went there today for a quick bite and it was pretty decent. I ordered the carnitas burrito and my two friends ordered breakfast burritos: one with chorizo and one with bacon. Both looked quite good. We didn't leave with any leftovers so that pretty much sums it up.   It would be a good hangover spot for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way to work for a breakfast burrito.  I ordered the Machaca and Egg burrito and while it was ok about halfway through the grease started to soak through so much the filling was falling out of the bottom of the tortilla.  At that point I just was kinda grossed out and threw out the rest of the burrito.  Luckily it was a huge burrito so I had my fill on by that point anyways.  Doubt I'll go back when I know Filiberto's isn't too far away."}
{"text":"Came to Ramiro's Taco Shop while on a carne asada fries mission. The fries were edible nice and crisp but the carne asada was sub-par and lacked flavor. The salsa quality here was also lacking - very watery. It was enough to get me by until I found  the deliciousness that is Poliberto's fries. The only thing is that most people go hunting for carne asada fries late at night... so polibertos (which closed at 12 on a Saturday) wouldn't work out... in that case Ramiro's is definitely doable... not great but will satisfy the need."}
{"text":"This is a local family owned business. You walk in and they treat you like family mijo, mija greet you with a smile. In addition the food is good. It's not upscale but feels homey"}
{"text":"Always a great place for the munchies. I've only tried the carne asada fries, carne asada burrito, and California burrito. These are quite good. They definitely give you a lot of carne asada fries to the point of feeling grossed-out if you finish it all. There is also red and green sauce for you if you fancy it.  As with a lot of hole-in-the wall Mexican food joints, the location is shady and the food is greasy but it is good for late night weekend hunger, all-nighter studying food and drunken hungriness.  An upside is that this place is open 24 hours when a lot of the other fast food places around here are closed, except for Jack in the Box and Whattaburger."}
{"text":"We only come here when it is way past our bedtime and bad habits start creeping in...hey, I'm a grad student, cut me a break! In all seriousness though, this is a decent, 24 hour, Mexican fast food joint thats definitely better than taco bell or jack in the crack (as my undergrad classmates lovingly liked to call it). They actually take the time to cook your food to order which is much appreciated for a late night meal... but it also means you may have to wait about 15-20 minutes to get your food. Worth it IMO. You can always order ahead.    What we've ordered:  *Carne asada quesadilla- delish! tender meat! *Fish tacos- not bad, combo comes with rice and beans *Chicken Enchiladas- good for fast food *Carne Asada fries- decent but nothing like what we have back home (CA) *Chips and guacamole- its okay but I always forget they top it off with a ton of shredded cheese which I hate. Gotta remind myself to tell them next time. Also they put a lot of tomatoes in it so if you don't like tomatoes, this is not for you.  *Pina (pineapple juice)- Don't like it, totally watered down with a hint of bubblegum flavor? Maybe that was just my batch.   Their salsas are good too. The red one is super spicy with the taste of toasted red chilli pepper flakes. The green one, less spicy and more flavorful. I need to try their picked stuff next time.   Will we be back? Yes probably and definitely for as long as I'm in school haha."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place from the beginning but decided to try it anyways. I understand its a small place but have some pride!! I got a steak chimichanga combo and the food was so hot that it BURNT holes in the cheap quality to-go containers! By the time I got home, the entire bag was filled with slime that leaked out from the plate. The lid for the salsa wasnt on all the way so that spilled as well creating a huge mess. And the worst... there was a HAIR in the sludge the call refried beans! A hair!!! HAIR!!!!!!!! i seriously threw up. There are things that I wuld be willing to put aside but a hair, never. That is UNACCEPTABLE when it comes to food. i will NEVER go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When the original location at 75th & Indian School opened back in the 90's there were few places like it in the valley  (prior to the \"'Bertos\" explosion of the aughts) and it was, in the parlance of the day, the bomb. Super nachos, yo!  Ramiro's has since opened and closed several locations and lamentably the quality has suffered since the West Side (Wessside!) heyday. The food here is decent and fairly priced, but nothing that will knock your socks off. A good after hours joint to aid in soaking up the poison you've consumed all evening."}
{"text":"As far as late night eats: probably not too bad if you're buzzed or high. Apart from that, mediocre Mexican food. Not great on flavor and taste. Nothing special. Apart from that, the late night worker on this particular Friday (9/23) was a jerk. Mind you, I'm Hispanic. I know Spanish, but couldn't understand this guy so I kindly asked him twice to repeat himself... because I just couldn't understand what he heck he said! Apparently he did not like that. The idiot didn't know he hadn't completely closed the Drive thru window when he decided to mimic me and talk crap about me in Spanish. Pinché pendejo. You lost my business and I'll be sure to spread the word. Places like yours are on every corner in Phoenix. You need to do better than this."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican Food joint in West Phoenix. They have great customer service, and are great to call in an order. It's not a place to sit in and eat w/the family, but a nice take-home place. I usually order the chicken chimi. Great alternative to the chain restaurants."}
