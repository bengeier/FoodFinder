{"text":"This review is for the dinner we ordered for last nights Rosh Hashana. The food was awful and in my opinion a total waste of money. The soup tasted like water. The side dishes were totally lacking in flavor, very very bland. I was extremely disappointed and will never order a meal from this establishment again. Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"The Owner is sweet
And kind.  Good product selection.  Good customer service.  Always provide a bag of ice so I can travel
Delicious homemade borekas stuffed cabbage kasha varnishes    Love their variety is frozen gefilte fish and kiska   Lots of parking and fresh Challah and rolls. Desserts and lots of Israeli products"}
{"text":"Most people don't know that there is also a dining area here in addition to their deli. I try to come back often, as they have the BEST fried chicken AND french fries. It may take about 20 minutes for them to prepare it and they do confirm, but it's worth the wait. This is what I call clean food as you can tell the oil is fresh and so is the chicken. It is so juicy and the crunchy coating is amazing. And the service is always very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"While I don't keep kosher, I have used Imperial Kosher Market 3 times this past year for guests.  I've bought from the market to prepare at home, got take out for a guest at a bridal shower, and most recently catered a kosher meal for an open house.  All three experiences were 5 star.  I told Shai I wanted a Sephardic-Israel theme dinner.  His menu was perfect and delicious.  So many dishes from hummus and Israeli salad to Mediterranean meatballs, schnitzel fingers, couscous, herb rice to a delightful tiramisu.  My kosher guest was so happy and honored that I had this wonderful meal for her.  Shai and his wife Esther delivered the food.  They are so incredibly nice and thoughtful.  You don't need to keep Kosher to enjoy the outstanding service and quality of food.  Some reviews say it is expensive but when you choose to support a local family business and one that offers Kosher food, the price is higher than the big stores.  There is no comparison.  Kosher meat is higher priced.  The quantity was so much more than other caterers would have given for the number I gave him.  There were leftovers for more meals later that week.  
I will be using Imperial for all the Kosher needs in the future and on other occasions for catering."}
{"text":"Imperial Market & Deli

I love browsing and shopping in ethnic markets. Most of these diverse little stores are great opportunities to learn about different cultures, countries, people, the world. So I recently walked into Imperial Market, a kosher market that serves the Jewish community of Phoenix.  I have been to many stores that serve many different cultures and colors of people, and always feel somewhat welcome. The employees of Imperial Market needs some customer service training.  I did get a hello when I walked in, but after that the warmth melted away. I will say the store has some beautiful products, mostly seem to come from Israel, so if you need a specialty item, they may have it. I went in hoping to get some pita and fig jam, they had none. In the deli case, they had a small assortment of kanishas, I bought a spinach one and the, I will call him a gentleman just to be nice, questioned my request for just 1. That was all I wanted and if he was not so cold with me, maybe I world have bought another one.  I am a person who tries to respect everyone no matter who they are.  These people have no idea who I am or what my belief is and I felt like they saw me as just another person who they choose to disrespect. I know how important these little family owned stores are to the community, and I also know this store has been around a long time, but in todays world, we need to put our difference aside, atleast while we are at work, because the cycle if hate will continue, even in a small market that serves the community as big as Phoenix  is."}
{"text":"Great kosher food and equally great pricing. The staff is very friendly and informative especially for gentiles. The selection is pretty vast and yummy."}
{"text":"I'm writing to make a comment on all the yelpers here who criticize this place for its high prices, one going to the extreme of saying he was \"raped.\" Glatt (strictly) Kosher food is, by nature, very esoteric, hard-to-find, and produced in small amounts for the ultra-Orthodox religious. This is the ONLY market in the whole state of Arizona that procures most of what they sell from Brooklyn and Israel because their clientele is so small and specialized. If you're not an Orthodox Jew, this store is not in business to serve you and you can shop ANYWHERE else and pay less! You complainers are like someone with a Chevy who wanders into a Lamborghini dealership and bitches about the high prices on parts! Go to Walmart!"}
{"text":"Great place for Torah Observant folks to get clean meat, etc.  Good place to have lunch - I just wish that I did not live so far east otherwise, I would be a regular!  Oh - almost forgot!  The reason I give them four stars instead of five is because they over-price their products. Be prepared to shell out the dough for a little... but at least its kosher.  If there was real kosher competition in this valley they would not survive with exorbitant prices.  Nevertheless, the folks at this deli are really nice people and helpful.  I highly recommend this shop."}
{"text":"I was too exhausted to make Thanksgiving this year.  Thank goodness for Imperial.  Everything was delicious, but the turkey itself was the real standout.  I'm a Thanksgiving sides person. In fact, I rarely eat the Turkey.  But this year was different.  The meat was that good!  And that got me parve pumpkin pie, no small feat.  I'll order again next year!"}
{"text":"I went to the market for the Passover selection. They had lots of things to choose from and were so friendly and helpful. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Imperial for lunch,,, never been before.  The people were nice, the place was quiet, it was a Sunday.   ALL at our table were very impressed with the quality of the food and the service left nothing out !
We will definitely be going back and we told them when we left !  We'll be back and the market is amazing also... the prices are a bit high but the kosher aspect makes for more food testing and high prices are just to be expected.  We had a great experience all around."}
{"text":"Well since my visiting cousin had to eat kosher we checked out this joint down in Phoenix. The dining room was empty at 5:30 and it is not a cozy spot either, kind of cluttered and unfriendly. The prices for some food are a bit high including my $15 chicken stir fry, which consisted of a few veggies (some overcooked) and some below average chicken in a strange light peanut sauce with white rice. My cousin's double burger ($13) was a normal burger as far as I could tell.
  My major issues at this place include not much made fresh as they feature frozen falafel and deli-sliced Corned Beef and pastrami. I think there is a big difference between kosher places and places that serve Jewish food like Chompie's, plus Phoenix has about three Kosher restaurants, so it is not an area of food that gets much love in the valley. Good thing my cousin picked up the bill."}
{"text":"Overpriced items both in the store and on the menu compared to other kosher places in the area."}
{"text":"ordered for take out.great chicken fingers and goof taste.recomended"}
{"text":"The scent of fresh bread baking filled my nostrils as I walked in the shop side of this little neighborhood store (restaurant was already closed).

About 1 hour later after a plethora of questions and 2 bags filled with house made and jarred, frozen and refrigerated goodies I jumped in the car to take a bite of the meat \"cigar\" and one of the boregas ($1.49 each or $0.99 each if you buy 12 or more) First impression: Hmmmm....these really are meant to be eaten warmed up so will wait to get home and try them again.

My overall impression of the shop is they cater more to the neighborhood (as all good shops do don't they? (*_^.) There's a good amount of folks nearby who are not Phoenicians, eat halal and are looking for the brands that remind them of home. So, to me that's what is primarily offered and the price point reflects that.

As with all stores you will pay a premium for imported items I did find a couple packages items that were fairly good deals. Such as the tofutti sour cream was only $3.99 and a pack of frozen perch was $6.99.

I would've spent less if I had not purchased the house made goodies, but my overall experience was very good and everyone from the shopkeep to the lady whipping up fresh bread were more than happy to indulge my queries.

As for other comments made about pricing I think for the neighborhood it's about right + the name of the store is Imperial Kosher Market not Discount Kosher Market ;p

If you are really looking for a supermarket there is one across the street that offers generic food offerings ;)

p.s. The boregas do taste better warmed up :)"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I walked out of a market feeling so absurdly ripped off. I went in and purchased 3 small spinach bourekas and a potato knish. I also specifically asked if the knish was fresh from today and was told it was. The price was $12.00 which is beyond outrageous and actually just felt made up. For $12.00 anywhere else you can get a few dozen borekas. To further frustrate me the knish was not at all fresh. I bit into it and it tasted frozen  with the potato inside being like powder. Gross place. Obnoxious owner who is taking advantage of the jewish community. Never again."}
{"text":"It's a really great store run by really nice people till you get raped by the ridiculously marked up prices"}
{"text":"I buy my meats here. Better than WF organic meats. The owners are very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Great kosher food and they have this fabulous kosher fake \"bacon\" that I love to buy.  Greasy, but so good....moderation is everything right?  The owners are some of the nicest people on the planet and if you are looking for kosher food - they have a great selection.  I will sometimes have them make me several different salads before a Yom Tov and they really do an amazing job!"}
{"text":"I visited yesterday, and I have to say that I was impressed. My first time here, and the guys working were very helpful and answering any questions I had. I had recently converted to Judaism, so I've been trying out a bunch of new foods and recipes. I purchased some varnishkes while I was here. It was delicious. I will definitely be back. Thank you for putting up with my questions. Will recommend this place. Shabbat Shalom."}
{"text":"The Fried Chicken was really dry, but it was also delivered to me in Scottsdale, so possibly it sat too long.  The vegetables with it had zero seasoning and half were fresh, the green beans were canned."}
{"text":"FALAFEL!!!!
Really, there is nothing else to say, but I will anyway. I have been looking -- in vain -- for good falafel in Phoenix for years. It got so bad that I even made my own (which weren't half bad). But, as of today, my search is over. The falafel appetizer plate is wonderful. You get a generous serving of hummus -- creamy, with just the right amount of garlic, tahini and spices. Atop the hummus are five little balls of wonderfulness.  The falafel were crispy on the outside, moist and flavorful inside. YUM! The pita bread is delicious, so be sure to ask for two pieces as you'll want to use both to sop up all the hummus and cradle the falafel.
The menu prices are all over the place, with some items seeming a bit expensive. My falafel plate was reasonably priced and filled me up. My beloved had a pastrami sandwich with lots of fries. We were both satisfied.
The dining area is a bit spartan, but the food and good service make up for it.
After dining, it's fun to stroll through the little market area and look at all the imported goodies. We ended up buying some sugar-free treats for my father-in-law."}
{"text":"I would echo everything in Cindy L.'s review.  Imperial is a small market, but they offer an amazing variety and quality of foods.  The owners are sweet, friendly, helpful and just plain nice.  We are so very grateful for their presence here, and for how they serve our community."}
{"text":"This review is for the kosher market, not for the adjacent restaurant, which I have never tried.  

I drive 20 miles to get here a couple of times a month.  Why?  Not for the prices, which are in line with other kosher stores in this area, but definitely not cheap.  Not for the ambiance, which is clean but crowded and a little disorderly.  Here's why --

Imperial Kosher tries to serve the needs of the kosher community in a very small store, and it succeeds.  Selection is surprisingly large for such a small space.  They seem to have most of the essentials, including meats, cheeses, and a full service deli.  Most importantly, somebody has spent time trying to get good quality products on the shelves; not everything marked kosher is something you would enjoy eating, but Imperial has found a lot of worthy items.  Don't be afraid to try a brand you don't know well.

This is a true family place, so don't expect supermarket-like efficiency.  But do expect friendly service and people who care about their customers.  

IMPERIAL: Suggestion for your restaurant.  At off hours, anyway, consider making it into a self-service coffee/tea bar.  Make some reading materials available, sell a few pastries.  Maybe your customers will hang around for a while.  You could be a cool meeting place."}
{"text":"This is the best kosher market in the Valley. Outside Arizona you might find a better selection, but this is the best here.

Imperial is run by Dad and two sons. Everyone is friendly and helpful. No attitude. Many places will treat you like you're ignorant if you aren't a regular and need to ask questions. Not here. Genuinely nice guys.

It is a very small shop, nearly crammed with goodies without being overstuffed. They carry the complete Simply Bread line. Sometimes they run out of these items, but they will let you know when the next delivery will be. The challah rolls make for great sandwiches. Deli meats include a large variety of turkey based products, so it's possible to avoid beef if you like.  Turkey breast, smoked turkey breast, turkey salami, turkey pastrami, turkey bologna, etc.  They also make sandwiches to go but I've never had one.

In addition to the usual stock of Kosher food, the owners import several fresh Israeli foods, including hummus. This is the main reason for the fifth star. The imported selection is great fun and discovery. Unfortunately, the choices are not always predictable, so I might go in for hummus and it won't be there, but something new might have come instead. There are also Israeli spices, jams, chocolate (including dairy-free chocolate), and wines. Breakstones whipped butter and Temptee cream cheese are in the cold case.

I also like that they package fresh chicken wings. I used to buy the IQF wings, but they are never as good as fresh. A good BBQ sauce and wings. Thank you Imperial Market."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very happy and welcoming. The man who helped me couldn't have been nicer and helped me when I couldn't pronounce anything. I would definitely recommend you come here. The prices are amazing as well!"}
