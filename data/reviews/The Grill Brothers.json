{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma with rice and made the mistake of ordering hot sauce and garlic sauce. I noticed right away that my meal tasted weirdly sweet and then noticed that the \"garlic sauce\" was nothing more than ranch dressing. The hot sauce seemed to be chipotle mayo. It was the trashiest excuse for shawarma I've ever had. Fix your sauce."}
{"text":"Went here with my family on a Sunday night aro. It was pretty dead, only one other customer in there. We ordered 2 chicken shawarma plates, one shawarma special, and a two engine burger. Food was reasonably priced and the shawarma was prepared right away. The burger took longer, the rest of us had already started eating by the time it came along. It was huge portions. None of us could finish our plates. The rice on the shawarma plates was undercooked and some of it was rock hard, I even broke a dental appliance taking an unsuspecting bite of it. Sauce on the chicken was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall I'd say it was alright, but nothing special. Good lunch deals for students."}
{"text":"Dont waste your money nor time at this restaurant. The food is below average for the price. The staff and owner is extremely rude. Dont pay until you receive your food. 
Their service is extremely slow. When we asked for money back the owner simply denied. We requested few times. Then he took personal jab by commenting on our size. It was simply horrible. All the customers in the restaurant felt stupid for eating there by the owners behaviour. 
There are other much better restaurants nearby for cheaper price and better customer service. 
They are brand new and if this is how they are expecting to remain in business good-luck to them."}
{"text":"The Grill Brothers restaurant is located in a desolate storefront. In the past, it used to be an Afghan restaurant, a sandwich place, and a Vietnamese restaurant. They all failed. Hopefully the Grill Brothers will do better.

I ordered a Shawarma pita sandwich and an iced tea for $10.75. the sandwich was delicious.

The decor of the restaurant was nice and there is plenty of seating.

This is the 2nd time I have been here. The service is gruff and brisk. I will probably will return since the prices are good and the food is excellent"}
{"text":"I was wandering the neighborhood and I happened to notice this place, which seems to have just popped up out of nowhere. So I walked in and the place was completely empty, devoid even of staff. A few moments later, a helpful clerk strolled out from the back and I placed my order.

I went with the Chicken Shawarma wrap and was consequently given a heck of a lot of options for what I wanted in there. The dude threw in everything but the kitchen sink; lettuce, tomatoes, hummus, beans, tabbouli, cucumbers, etc, etc. It wasn't surprising, then, that the wrap had already burst open by the time I was ready to eat it. I've included before and after pictures; you'll note, probably without much surprise, that most of the wrap ended up on the tray.

That being said, it was a tasty meal. The plentiful chicken had that nice crisp that you want, and the various sauces were quite flavorful. I just wish the whole thing had managed to hold its integrity for more than the first two bites."}
