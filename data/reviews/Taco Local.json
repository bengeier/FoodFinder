{"text":"The food was pretty good. I got a bowl with tuna and green chili and ginger soy. I just wish the waitress would have explained their menu a bit more. And maybe I would have added more to my bowl. For the amount of money I paid I was expecting there to be more than 3 ingredients.  The nacho were awesome though. The chips were so yummy.  Also it's not very family/child friendly.  We were there on a weekday during the afternoon so the restaurant was fairly quiet. But there were no kid menus no crayons. I wasn't even offered a high chair for my 1 year old.  I would come back and try it again. But with no kids this time. And I would hopefully order something a bit more substantial."}
{"text":"Best guac in all of CLE!!! Tacos are out of this world... the only grip I have is the margaritas. Amp them up and I'll be there nightly!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to see what the hype was about.  First impression, not bad. Fun decor and laid back atmosphere.  The appetizer chips with cheese dip was very good ( although the cheese side could be a little bigger, considering all the chips you get with it). Ordered tacos - (3 for 7.50) but everything is A La Carte so it's an additional charge depending on what you get. The food was good, but nothing that really stood out to me. Glad i tried it though."}
{"text":"If you have ever had real Mexican tacos or burritos from SoCal you are now in luck to do it again in Willoughby. Best new place makes you feel like you are sitting on a beach in SoCal. The staff is great, atmosphere is outstanding and the food is phenomenal. A must stop in and eat"}
{"text":"Food tasty, service friendly, but waits too long for this guy. The waitress was real nice, let us know a cook quit so the food order was backed up after 15 minutes of waiting. Then we waited some more... no joke, an hour upon arrival we got our food. Yay! We never got a refill and she stopped coming to our table. She brought the check and left us there for 5 minutes, and I had to go to the counter to pay. She apologized for the wait again, but it still left a sour and dry taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I did not eat here.  I and my daughter walked in and once I saw the porn and nasty artwork, we left.  I did go back and complain of the fact that families with kids go in there and the artwork is nasty - just like Local Tavern in Mentor!  - Glad that one went out of business and I hope this one does too.  Now, I am not looking to impose my will, but if you are going to have artwork like that, at least warn the families BEFORE they enter!  I am tired of our kids - especially young boys being bombarded by this junk!"}
{"text":"Reviews of this place seem all over the place.  Personally, I love it.  I realize that service and pricing can be important, unless the service or something else is really bad and noteworthy, my reviews are all about the food, which for me is the main purpose of eating at a restaurant.  I love their burritos and their queso sauce.  I've had the nachos, too, but I keep going back to the burrito.  I always like places that offer some unique menu items and this place is a bit different than others in the area, so I enjoy it."}
{"text":"The prices are fair, the service was friendly, all the obvious decor steps were made to give it some character, the selection of hot sauces and beers was ample, all en route to a remarkably pedestrian not-great-but-also-not-offensive experience.   I have had tacos once and a smokin' bowl in my recent trip, and have found them to be consistently descent. Don't go expecting tacos rolled up on piping hot hand slapped tortillas made from criollo corn like you are perusing the street fair at 2am in Tijuana. Instead, enjoy your friends' or coworkers' company in a convenient and tolerable location with food that is equally tolerable. Carry out is also a good, quick and fast option.   Taco local is as authentically Mexican as Sammy Hagar's knowledge of tequila, but that's not what this place is trying to be. Accordingly, let's just get down to business on some reasonably priced tacos, slather them with the appropriate sauces and call it a day."}
{"text":"Mmmm.... I went on my lunch break. The steak tacos were soooooooo good! They also do vegetarian friendly tacos, such as the beet and grilled mushroom. They also have tofu tacos. The prices are reasonable. They also serve alcohol and the environment is extremely"}
{"text":"My mom and I enjoyed our tacos. Have to be careful with her as she can't do spicy. Mushroom and sirloin tacos were the best of the ones we tried. Chips were homemade and excellent. Service was friendly but could have used a drink refill. Over all a good place with good food of a quality that you can't get everywhere else. Will be back."}
{"text":"Interesting tacos and burritos.  I have eaten in and taken out, both experiences were great.  It is still the only place doing a variety of fish Tacos: Mahi, tuna, cod, and shrimp.  All are good."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food and a good value. Service is always spotty-we expect to wait and have multiple servers help us. If you go in with a little patience, it's a nice fresh meal. Could do without the slushy style margaritas, but the hubs has no complaints about the beer selection. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I saw the excellent reviews on this place so I decided to try that I'm glad I did.  I ordered the tacos wow are they good I love the way they flavored and spice the meat Will definitely be back and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Food is great when it's consistent. Love the burritos- they are well worth the money! I like mine without sauce but that's because the amount of sauce they put on the wet one isn't worth it for $1.00-$1.50 more. I'd rather add a second salsa for $2.00 and use that instead.  At times, greens aren't consistent texture within the burrito, and the last time we ordered the pineapple salsa, it was all juice, no substance...very weird. I love the flavors of everything but wish it was good every time. One other complaint is that the service is also a little off. Servers seem annoyed to be at work and wear their hair down while serving. The entrance is always weird too, should we seat ourselves? Or is there a hostess? Can't ever tell. I stopped going in and only order out now, but bummed the food isn't consistent. When it's good--it's one of the tastiest foods in the area!!"}
{"text":"What a perfect addition to Downtown Willoughby! Cool decor, tasty taco treats, fresh ingredients, a friendly staff. Can't wait to come back and try more tacos, and maybe a margarita!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Burritos are huge. Good selection of hot sauce at the table. Funky theme. I wish there was one in my town.  I will come back here.  We wish we could make food this good at home with local fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Taco Local. I finally went there at a time where I did not have to pay Ballantine's 3 bucks for parking. I have to say, the food was wonderful. Everything was fresh made and it tastes like home made. I have had the street tacos and the bomb burritos. I will be coming back again, just not when I have to pay another restaurant to park closer. If they had parking, Taco Local would get 5 stars. The food is that fresh and GOOD. My original complaint was that Ballanitnes, the restaurant on the other corner charges 3 dollars to park in back of the Taco Local building.   If Ballantines was so stupid to open a restaurant with NO parking in the back of their own building, then that attitude  must transfer into the restaurant too!  Would you walk over 3 blocks in the rain to eat there? NO! I was a valet in Downtown Willoughby, and paying to park myself almost as much as I tip a valet (usually 5 dollars) tells me someone is too stupid to make what they need from running a restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay...not sure why my previous review was removed and not considered in the part of the review process, but now I'll have to write another.. Please check out my previous review in the not recommended portion of this page.  I was completely honest about this joint.  I hope all the success for this place, but if they don't change it will not have a chance...the food was blah and too expensive for what you get.  Please read my previous review for my full and honest opinion of the place...frankly there are better places to spend my money....not sure if someone knows someone from yelp, but leave people's reviews posted so everyone reading them can make up there own minds and opinions.  Thank you...please read my previous review...."}
{"text":"First, the good -Service was very prompt and fast.We ate here around 10:30 on a Friday night. The atmosphere was cute and trendy. Loved that you could plug your phone in while you ate!   The bad- Food was not good. I ordered a chicken bowl and it tasted horrible with only a little bit of chicken in it. It was drenched in sour cream. I couldn't even eat it.   My friends tried a bite of it and tbought it tasted spoiled.  Expensive for the amount you got also."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, but falls just short of being great!  Owned by the same people as the ambitious (but struggling) Local Tavern, and the new comer to downtown Willoughy, Local Sol.  Taco Local checks all the right boxes.  Mexican/ Island vibe, check.  Mexican (not Tex Mex!) food like street tacos and tortas, check!  Over stuffed burritos to appeal to the Chipotle crowd, check!  Mexican beers and slushy machine with \"margaritas\", check!  The problem is every box is checked but none of them are checked in such a way that things make me want to come back.   The street tacos are good, but I want more out of my flour tortilla than being half heartedly steamed so that they're kinda soggy and only slightly warmed.  The tortas are good, the guacamole is good, the selection of salsas is good, but nothing is great.  The service is....  there....    The staff is there to get a paycheck, but no one has ever made me think they enjoyed working there."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the bowl with fish and had to get the waitress back three times to finally get what she wanted.  The tomatillo sauce tasted like someones ranch dressing,  I had to taco's the beet which I thought was good and the mushroom / grilled onion one which was so smothered in cream sauce that I couldn't even taste the main ingredients.  IF we go back I will be sure to order the taco's with ALL sauces on the side.  I think my expectations were just a little bit too high."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for get birthday. Wednesday evening at 6. We got dat right away!  Fun decor and surf vibe.   The take our area seemed large. Maybe could add more tables.   We both got the rainbow margarita. It was good, not great.   The chips and pico were good. Loved the chips!   I ordered 3 tacos. Lime chicken, green chili pork and chorizo beef.   The chicken wasn't bad just not a ton of flavor. The green chili was awesome and the chorizo beef had a ton of flavor.   This reminded me of places I ate while in Austin! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Very fresh and flavorful. Cali vibe for sure. Reasonably price and nice staff. Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Similar to a chipotle but more like Barrio.  Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Order of chips doesn't come with salsa. You have to order salsa separately. Glad that Taco Local recently decided to add Local Tavern favorites to the menu. Been giving this restaurant several tries and still not one of those that I am 100% sold on. It's a bit overpriced for what you get. Service isn't the best, no refills unless you ask for it."}
{"text":"I have to say that I agree with a previous review, the concept of this place is pretty cool,  the menu is pretty good, but the execution is just not there.  The food is just not that good.  I will have to give this place another shot to see if I change my mind.  I will update my review if necessary."}
{"text":"Food was OK. I may go back to give it another try. Service was pretty horrible so that is really what is keeping me away....dont get me wrong the girl was super sweet but just bad at her job. Had to ask for our appetizers. The server forgot that I ordered a drink so had to ask twice.  Also forget asking the other servers for something because they will just keep walking like you didn't even speak. All around...not impressed. Has potential though...maybe hire servers that know how to do that job rather than just another pretty face. (And as a former server/bartender I know my shit)"}
{"text":"Late night menu was amazing! Staff was great! Cant wait to come for the full menu. Fresh ingredients done with a gourmet flare!"}
{"text":"I think I got food poisoning throwing up right when I left. We out for s dinner with friends.. Sad this restaurant inst what it seems for the price they are crazy"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. I've been here 4 times and twice the food was tasty (had a shrimp bowl & tuna taco). And twice the food was not so good (had a steak taco and a mahi bowl with queso dip). The service is ok. Not bad but not great. However, I do like the new concept in downtown Willoughby and I do recommend people to go here!"}
{"text":"We visited Taco-Local on Sunday...this was a our first visit.  The food was very good and fresh. We split the Bomb Burrito and the Muchos Nachos.  The portions are very large, definitely left feeling satisfied, The only down side was the server, she was nice, but not very tentative. She would walk by at look at the table, drinks glasses would be empty and she would not even acknowledge it.  We had to flag her down each time we need something.  When she dropped off the check, she was extremely polite at that point and was back at the table very quickly  just as she saw me taking out my wallet."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with two coworkers. My one coworker and I loved it, while my other coworker was not a big fan.  I ordered a bowl with mushroom & beet, avocado sauce, and tomatillo sauce. The bowl also had rice, black beans, lettuce, and other vegetables.  It was much different than other Mexican restaurants, but it was extremely good. The bowl was a lot of 'greens' (lettuce, kale, etc), which is why the one coworker wasn't thrilled.   We also ordered chips with guacamole and pico. These were delicious, and I really enjoyed the flour chips instead of only having corn chips.   Definitely would recommend and go back in the future."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of Taco Local. It has a bit of a California surf vibe. There arent many tables so there can be a bit of a wait but the hostesses were all very friendly so we didnt mind waiting at all.  Our server was wonderful. Friendly, always there when you needed her but didnt hover.   The chips were great. My husband and I both ordered the street tacos. He loved them, I thought they were a little plain.   Taco Local loses a star from me for prices and not having a childrens menu. I realize DTW is more of a singles area but it would be nice just to have a few options."}
{"text":"The food here is Baja Mexican, a nice fusion of American and Mexican. The Muchos nachos are amazing and the specialty tacos are generally very good too. The price is fairly reasonable. All in all, a good place."}
{"text":"This is a tough call.  So follow me.  First, the place is very So Cal in design.  Great for the summer, a little cold for the winter.  But has a pretty good vibe with the open kitchen.  The service is so so.  We were seated quickly but the server was probably stretched.  She did not get refills unless we asked, which was when we could flag her down. That being said she was very friendly.  This would be tough though during the supper if they were packed.  As it was, they were about 50%.  On to the food: App - Chips and caso.  The chips were seasoned.  Salt and lime I think.  Had corn and flour.  I would prefer just plan chips.  The caso was home made and flavorless.  Very bland.  Not to mention after about 10 chips, it was gone leaving you with a basket of chips and nothing to dip them in.  So not very well thought out.  Not to mention the cost for the caso.  So I will pass next time.  Kid Menu - They don't have one.  By daughter just like beans and rice on a corn tortilla.  This should not be anything huge.  But, they make you order from the sides.  So, 3 corn tortillas a small dish of beans (maybe 2 Table spoons) and small dish of rice (2 table spoons), $8.25.  They should really be ashamed of them selves.  While the rice and beans were okay, they were not anything special and certainly not with that much.  I almost called the manager over it was that disappointing.  It was truly about $3.50 worth of a meal.  Maines - The good side.  So, all of the stuff so far has been a bit on the negative.  And to be honest, deserving of 2 stars.  But... - 3 Street Pork Tacos.  Best tacos I have had in a long, long time.  The flavor was there.  Hot, fresh.  Tortilla is done with cheese, so no need to add any.  You can also mix it up with chicken or beef if you like.  But I recommend the pork. - Burrito.  This thing is huge.  Wife got the chicken which I think tends to suck the flavor out of things.  That being said, it was really good.  You can get dry or wet.  It is good for 2 folks to share.     Biggest down side is you get no sides.  So, 3 tacos (which are really good) $8.50.  And that is on the low end.  the prices only go up.  If you want a little rice, $3.00.  A little Beans $3.00.  So now you are at almost $15.00 and I can tell you it isn't that damn good.   So if it were not for all of the other negatives, and I think they are big, this would be a 4 - 5 star place.  I think the things I mentioned are correctable, but if they will or not who knows.  If you are going in, get your taco' or burrito, skip the apps and drink water."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I walked into Taco Local. I thought, maybe it'll be better than Chipotle, and that'd be cool.   Not only was it better than Chipotle, it was better than any Mexican food I've had to date. The atmosphere was fun and hip. The space is smaller than I expected, and I was hesitant of the small seats (two top bench) that sat us at. It works out though because the music is loud enough to drown out others conversations, but still allow you to have your own.   The menu is straight forward, but full of variety. There's street tacos (3 for $7.50!!!!!), especiale tacos (2 for $7.50), smokin' bowls ($7.50), and the bomb burrito ($7.50).  The street tacos, smokin' bowls, and bomb burrito come with your choice of protein - and boy, do they have options (10 all together!).    The service was great; atmosphere is fairly \"hipster-cali\", but fun.  We ordered chips, guac, and cheesy queso for our app (chips and salsa are not served automatically like most Mexican restaurants).  The app came within 10 minutes and was mind-blowingly delicious.  Not only do you have fresh made tortilla chips, but they also through in deep fried chips too! SO GOOD.  Guac was fresh made and chunky - great flavor.  Had to use two chips sometimes to get a good bite!  Cheesy queso had just enough fire, and was delicious with the fried tortilla chips.  My husband ordered the mahi-mahi street tacos, and I ordered the bomb burrito (no beans).  She asked if I wanted to make it \"sexi-mexi\" style (adding green and red chile, as well as queso sauces to it), and I declined.  I did add the queso.  What she did not tell me was how big the burrito would be.    When our food arrived, I was again- mind blown.  The street tacos looked divine, but what really killed me was the burrito!  It was, no joke, the size of a triple-stuffed burrito you would get at Chipotle.  You HAD to use a knife and fork to eat it.  As you cut into the burrito, you senses are overwhelmed with amazing smells - cilantro, slow cooked chicken, tomatillo sauce... Did I mention that the burrito is wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla?  Seriously - the best burrito of my life.  Crunchy, fresh, great mix of flavors - just. so. good.   My husbands mahi mahi street tacos were also delicious!  I had one bite, but to be fair - I hate fish tacos and these were amazing!  Only a little fishy on the end, but otherwise fresh and crunchy and good.    They offer a late night menu, take-out, a small outdoor patio, and of course - in-house seating.  Super friendly pricing, fun atmosphere, oh, and frozen margaritas.  What's more to love?  We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait. We waited 10 minutes for the waitress to get our drink order, 10 more minutes for it to arrive, 10 more minutes for chips and salsa and 20 more minutes for 9 tacos. Cheese was burnt, forgot my side of rice. Only checked on us twice.....needs major improvements for me and my friends to come back."}
{"text":"Someone said in another review a cross between barrio and chopotle and I thought that was a goo description - not as fancy as barrio but more options than chipotle -the seating looks a little limited and feb chips and salsa aren't free- but I had both the shrimp and bean/chorizo tacos and they were both very well seasoned . It was exactally what my boyfriend and I were looking for - a quick dinner. Definitely will go here over the typical Mexican restaurants that serve the same old same old."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I love Mexican food more than anything and their flavor in every taco is amazing!"}
{"text":"The place has great potential - the food is unique, the decor is edgy, the overall concept is great.  The problems are too numerous to list: - Where is the hostess stand? Oh, it's towards the back of the restaurant. - The restaurant appears to have 50+ people working, but not we received very little attention. - The owner (or guy who appeared to be in charge) ran around doing things that a manager should do (helping servers get drinks, directing traffic, etc.). He did NOTHING in the way of making me feel like I should come back. This is a new restaurant. Shouldn't he come around to talk to people?  - Should someone ask how we're doing? - Who created the menu? It's ridiculously confusing. How about some pictures? - Waitress asked us if we wanted our check, but our food hadn't even arrived. We were just two people, I clocked our dinner from order to table at 37 minutes. - Someone PLEASE train the wait staff. You never ask: \"You done with that?\" Wait staff are the customers primary contact with the restaurant. They should be like a best friend. They are what helps bring you back.  Let's be real... I'm wondering if all of the 4-5 star reviews are friends and family."}
{"text":"The name should have told me everything I needed to know...ive been twice, the first time I ordered a Bomb Burrito, it was TERRIBLE! Also, the mango salsa wasnt very good either.  The second time I ordered the tacos...they were AMAZING!  Bottom line, it is called TACO loco for a reason, stick to tacos when going there!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I visited on June 30th and had a great time. Upon walking in, Sarah informed us that there would be a bit of a wait due to all the tables being filled. Stephanie, our server, was very friendly. She checked on us several times and great suggestions on what to order. Our tacos were delicious and I throughly enjoyed the chips and pico salsa! We will definitely go back this Summer! Little bit of a wait because it was Taco Tuesday, but definitely worth it. The food was delicious and I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Taco Local, I Love You! Yesterday was my first visit and it was incredible! I had the street tacos - shrimp, beef, and chicken.....holy yum! The various meat choices were tender and cooked to perfection and the tomatillo crema was the perfect tangy topping. I really hope this place sticks around in dtw. I told my fiancé (were getting married in 5 days!!!) that if Taco Local were a person, I might leave him for them. There was a moment last night when I thought I might go back for dinner too, but that might be stalking."}
{"text":"Taco Local is a new restaurant opening in Downtown Willoughby.  There have been a couple of soft openings for friends and family which have been huge successes. As with the other \"Local\" locations (the 3 Local Tavern locations, FishBar) the atmosphere is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of art to check out and the guitars and surf boards built into the decor that you see at the other locations.    The food is amazing.  All extremely fresh ingredients and fresh tasting food! This is not another fast food burrito and taco shop - this is high quality Mexican at great prices.  Street tacos for 2.50, regular sized tacos for 3.75, huge burritos for 7.50 and other options such as bowls, a sandwich, a burger, lots of sides and desert!   Some of the proteins include chili lime chicken, green chili pork, seared steak, marinated mahi mahi, chorizo + beef, seared yellowfin tuna, sautéed shrimp, seared tofu, roasted beet & mushroom and fresh avocado.  These are all available with street tacos, burritos, bowls or sandwiches.   Definitely worth checking out.  Great to see a good Mexican restaurant in Willoughby.  And, rumor has it they will be open late on the weekends for the late night after-bar munchies!!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"My server was so incredibly rude I didn't even order food. I finished my marg and bolted. I won't be back and don't recommend coming unless you want to be talked down to my the wait staff. So disappointed, was really looking forward to trying this place. Can't and won't tolerate the attitude"}
{"text":"Next to the rough, washed up bars of Downtown Willoughby, you will find this gem. Aesthetically pleasing to the eye - this California dream of a taco joint does the trick when the grey days of Cleveland get you down. I have tried the bowl and burrito bomb which are both delectable. Portions are larger than Chipotle in my opinion, so you will have leftovers. The regular nachos and dessert nachos are both great. My favorite part of the restaurant is the skeleton lady mural painted in the women's bathroom. A must see. The decor is Super Fun. If you are in Lake County and want to try a healthy alternative to a typical Mexican joint - come here. The music and surfing videos are also a nice change from the terrible Cleveland sports bar vibe. My only dislike was the frozen margaritas. I thought they were too tart and sugary. Otherwise I am a regular."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars, that's where Taco Local would be.  We were very excited to try Taco Local.  We came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with his mom and grandma.  Nice looking menu, but there are some improvements that can be made. First thing to note is they don't have a liquor license,  which means just beer, wine, and malt liquor based frozen margaritas. We did order the rainbow margarita, which was ok, but of course does not compare to a tequila laced delight.  The boyfriend  ordered the street tacos-a tofu, mushroom  beet, and avocado.  Flavors of the main ingredients  were good, but the toppings were a bit lacking. Maybe some type of sauce would liven them up? I got the torta, and was a bit confused/disappointed that my only option was to do beet-mushroom-avocado, when I asked if I could just do mushroom or avocado,  I was told no, that it was a combo mixture, but they have a mushroom mix that goes on tacos, so not sure why that couldn't be put on my torta? I opted to get a torta without a protein since I love tortas, and really had wanted to try one.   My torta bun was delicious, the filling was good, but not great. If I had been allowed to choose a protein, such as the tofu or mushrooms,  it would have been a lot better.  It was loaded with shredded carrots, which pretty much just slid right off. Mom and Gram both got the smoking bowls, one Mahi Mahi and the other the beet mushroom.  The bowls were loaded, and looked super, until you realized the bowl was filled about 70% greens, 20% rice and beans,  and maybe 10% protein mixture.  A more balanced bowl would have been appreciated.  Neither one chose to take their greens home.  We ended up ordering 2 shroomin tacos to go, which were delicious,  and boosted the rating considerably.   We will go back, and I'm hoping they have made a few small changes,  and maybe they'll be a little more flexible in the options they provide."}
{"text":"That was a nice gesture for the owner to offer me, to give them another try. As a customer, I'm concerned that he's not concerned about a $30 screw up with our food. Yeah I'll be back right away.... I see where the Swiss cheese effect began"}
{"text":"I still like Taco Local after going back a second time.   You know why there's nothing good in DTW? Cuz all of you over-privileged, pseudo hoity-toity, suburban soccer moms wouldn't know something good if it smacked you nice, hard, and wet in your jaw.   Quit your bitching!   xoxo Taco Local. Me love you long time,"}
{"text":"SALT CITY way over salty on everything prices are way too high for tacos tried the burritos they aren't much better unless you love SALT and sauces that tear your stomach up and make you feel ill. service is hit or miss one girl is awesome where another cannot do her job to save her life. so after going here for a while we just kinda stopped going. tired of paying that much $$ for over salted food that isn't that great. too bad they could be so much better if they would just try. and the one thing that bothers me the most is the lies they tell since opening. I asked why don't you have real crunchy tacos I mean your a freaking taco place. was told they would have soon... well its been over a year and still no crunchy tacos so.... so long taco local"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate at Taco Local and I was really impressed. Loved the  decor, and the waitress was very helpful. The assortment of tacos and everything else was very good. Can't wait to bring my friends there. Special thanks to Eric!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Local had been on my bucket list for some time, had an opportunity to stop on a Thursday afternoon, after work.  The place was fairly empty, just 1 couple, in addition to myself.  I sat myself, as the sign in front directed.  I immediately looked for a drink menu, wanted a margarita.  The server informed me that the establishment doesn't have an alcohol license therefore they only have beer and frozen margaritas from a machine.  I I had my heart set on some street tacos and a margarita, at that point I referred back to the placemat menu and decided to order a bowl.  The bowl gives you a list of options to choose from, you choose your protein, sauce and a dressing.  The dressings were weird, for a mexican style bowl, the choices were avocado ranch, sherry vinaigrette  honey mustard and something else. I opted to not get a dressing  but I did add the cheese sauce and sour cream there was not an option for pico or salsa so I did order a side of that. The order took a little longer than I thought it would and I was not impressed once it was delivered.  The bowl consisted of a base of power greens, arugula, iceberg, kale and shredded brussel sprouts, which I normally love, this was a miss for me, the brussel sprouts were really thick and woody, very hard to chew.  There was also a smooth black bean sauce, which looked unappetizing and tasted awful, not sure, why the black beans needed to be made into a sauce instead of just plain black beans.  There was very little chicken, and it was chopped so fine I could barely taste it. The whole Bowl was drizzled in sour cream with smoky queso on the side, and thank goodness the queso was on the side because it didn't taste good either.  There was also a small scoop of flavorless rice.  Thank goodness I ordered the side of salsa which at least added a little bit of flavor to the Bowl but other than that this was a big disappointment, I couldn't finish it all especially the side of the bowl with the black bean sauce. And last but not least after I settled my bill, I saw numerous flyers and signs posted around the restaurant stating that Thursdays from 5 to 9 was Girl Power Day and everything on the menu is half off, I was charged full price even though I arrived after five o'clock, since I had already settled my bill I didn't bother go dispute it, but shame on my server!  I won't return."}
{"text":"Coming from California I was a little skeptical that this joint would be any good... I must say it was delicious!! Quite impressed and its got a cool look to the inside which I totally was diggin!! Will be returning whenever we are near... And the beer cost just as much as their iced tea!! I will take the beer next time..."}
{"text":"Such yummy food. They have great vegetarian options for everything! Street tacos, smokin bowls and the bomb burritos are all amazing! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here and it will be the last. Service was really slow and the rainbow margarita had more sugar than alcohol. Also, they tried to pass Caymen Jack Margarita as a traditional margarita, they even put salt on the rim and added ice... Nice try. I think I have diabetes from the rainbow margarita (I apologize to those with diabetes).  Good day!"}
{"text":"Sorry but I did NOT like anything about taco local! Ewwww the bowl was filled with shredded chicken that looked like they put in a blender.. Gross And I asked for avacado on it and it was no where to be found, it was a bowl of crap, hardly any rice just bad! The waitress was horrible, if you want to ruin your business hire a bunch of teenagers to stand behind the counter and talk all night and look like they just want to go home, and the tacos were just ok, I've had better ones off a menu at other restaurants that don't specialize in them. Lesson learned, and when we asked the waitress questions she had no idea of the answers, maybe she should be educated a little on salsa type, beer type, explaining the menu and actually being attentive to customers \ :"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. Menu items are reasonably priced. I was not impressed with the food or the service. Been there twice and tried several different menu options (street tacos and the bowls). Service is lacking. Had to ask for refills on drinks. We ordered queso and chips on one visit and never received the order. When asked, waitress said she forgot about it."}
{"text":"The nachos were huge and delicious! I also got the mushroom/ caramelized onion taco and the greens / feel good taco - Both were phenom considering they were meat-free.  The environment was cool, and servers at the counter were super nice.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were actually excited to try out this restaurant. It had a cool vibe from the outside and we were curious to see what it had to offer.  We walked in and it had a nice atmosphere, but was greeted by a rude blonde server with \"Dinning in or take out?\" Not even a hello or hey. That should've been our first red flag. She basically just told us to grab a seat and we did. Since it was our first time there, we wanted to take our time to look at the menu and figure out what we wanted and she seemed flustered and we felt like we didn't have enough time to decide on what we wanted to order. And throughout our entire time there, she gave off a bad attitude. Perhaps she was having a bad day, but she shouldn't have taken it out on paying customers.  Long story short, the food was decent for what it was. The restaurant had a nice ambiance and the only thing I kinda had a problem with was the lack of customer service from that server. I would come back and try out different tacos if we were guaranteed to have someone else come serve us."}
{"text":"I have been to Taco Local three times now and have been very pleased with the food each time. My favorite is the street tacos. The base of cojita cheese, tomato crema, cilantro, (and more) is an excellent combination of flavors for whatever protein you choose. As for picking a protein, I haven't had one I haven't liked.  The bomb burrito (as other reviewers have stated) is in fact huge. It's a good pick if you want a solid dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day. The flavor is top notch, but be prepared for a lot more vegetables than your typical burrito.  On my most recent visit we had great service. However, the two times before the service was dodgy. While it only slightly hinders your dining experience in my opinion it knocks the restaurant out of the running for 5 star status."}
{"text":"Oh lord, this place will BLESS YO SOUL!!!! The nachos are seriously best I've ever had, I wish they'd give you a slice of a lime or 2 with it to drizzle of it. I do it when i order out. It tastes great.   The drink prices are terrible. They can't compete with any one in down town Willoughby. I'll never order a drink there. Ever.   The people who work there are very very nice as well. They know the menu, and will answer as many questions as they can.   The interior of the place is very cool too. The granite outside though is insanely ugly. I mean woooooahhhh is that ugly. But if that's the worst thing I have to say...the place is amazing!   If you're in down town Willoughby, YOU HAVE TO STOP HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Really really good. Another home run by the bunch who brought us local tavern. What an excellent addition to the busiest corner in our wonderful little town. Great decor, service, and ambiance. But the food is the star. Highly recommended for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Pricy. And you got nothing on a taco. I got a tofu taco and my husband a seared yellow fin tuna taco and they came with one piece only. Really?!  You have to pay for chips and salsa too. And the chips suck. Go to barrios in tremont, better price and food. Service horrible. They only serve beer and its pricy. Never again"}
{"text":"Thank you Taco Local. Thank you for leaving my boyfriend and I waiting at the hostess stand for over 15 minutes with no acknowledgement at all, not even a glance our way from an employee, while 2 or 3 of your staff hung out at the front and chatted with some friends. Thank you for this, because instead of continuing to wait and be ignored, we simply left and went to Willoughby Brewing and had a wonderful meal with friendly staff. We were much happier there than we would have been at Taco Local ultimately, so we thank you for that. (I'm sure WBC appreciated the business too.)    This was our 4th or 5th visit to TL. Our first visit was OK. Some of the food is pretty tasty and the prices are reasonable, but the service left a little to be desired. Our server seemed genuinely annoyed to have to take our order and bring us drinks.   We chalked it up to \"Hey, maybe she's having a rough day,\" even though the place wasn't even close to being crowded and she wasn't the only server working. Benefit of the doubt though.   A friend from out of town came to visit, and knowing she'd like the veggie options there, we took her to TL. The only notably bad thing was that we had to ask twice for the queso we ordered with the chips and salsa. It finally came with the meal, when the chips were mostly gone already (and they're not complimentary, so no refills on chips). We did get an apology for that. No offer for credit or anything, but an apology. I'm not one to ask for things to be taken off my check, but I always appreciate when staff recognizes that an issue like not actually being able to eat the item ordered in the way it's intended probably deserves some sort of credit or discount... but I digress.  Every other time we'd been there - not counting last weekend - the service was really just... bad. Every server we've had has either screwed up the order (and I don't mean the kitchen - I mean forgetting to bring us something or bringing the wrong drink order) or has been so inattentive to the point that we had to flag her down for the check.   It's sort of set up like a fast casual sort of thing, so I don't expect that we're going to get the most awesome service ever. But I don't think asking that our order be correct or a server that doesn't think it's a complete waste of her time to be doing her job is really much to ask, even at a fast casual place.   The food is OK. The idea is great but the execution is inconsistent (have had the rice under cooked to a point of it being inedible, one time the pork was fantastic, and the next time it was bland) and most of it isn't as good as the description makes it sound. But I like that there are lots of options, and it was good enough that despite crappy service, we kept going back.    No more though. Last weekend was that final straw... Sunday afternoon, about 1:30 or 2 PM. There were 4 or 5 tables seated, and a crowd of about 7 or 8 people hanging around at the counter. I thought at first they were ordering or waiting on to-go orders, but they were chatting and laughing with the staff, so I don't know if they were just visiting. The place was not busy... we stood at the front for at least 15 minutes by the hostess stand (there's no sign that says seat yourself, and there had always been a hostess in the past) -- we were there for a little longer than that because I didn't start timing it until it felt like we'd been standing there for a while.   In that time, not one member of the staff even glanced our way. I don't even think they knew we'd been there and left.   Since none of the staff appears to want our business, we've decided we won't give it to them.   This is especially odd to me because this restaurant is related to Local Tavern -- we have been to several of the Local Tavern locations and had nothing but good service and good food there. I guess we're seeing the difference a bad manager can make."}
{"text":"Very fresh here! My husband and I came in for a quick bite and it was perfect in and out in 30 min and we were so full! Ingredients are fresh. The only thing we weren't crazy about is the cheese crust option for the tacos, both of ours were really overcooked and it could have ruined the whole meal. I would recommend not getting the cheese coated shells."}
{"text":"I love this place already! The food is excellent! There is something on the menu for everyone. Beats by J are fantastic along with the Beef + Chorizo street tacos! Looking forward to trying more things on the menu. This is exactly what DTW needed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on MLK day decent lunch crowd. My wife and I enjoyed the bowls. We really liked the mix of flavors which can Change each time depending on the sauces.  Service was very slow however they looked understaffed. The waitress came back to table once so did not receive refills on our drinks. Overall I enjoyed the food it was a good twist on Mexican fare. Will try the ahi taco's on next visit."}
{"text":"Am so in love with this place the Atmosphere the people and above all the taste of a real California Burrito and you must try the Carne asada s"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price... Except for the 7layer dip. It's a 4oz serving not a meal...Evan though its priced like one."}
{"text":"Went to Taco Local for the first time on 7/29 - food was excellent, service was okay, could have been better. Pork is absolutely delicious. Went back on Monday 8/1 for lunch.. I agree with the comment on facebook page 2.95 for a soda is a little high when it is very hard to get a refill as the service was a little slow. Rice was hard, and had a bone in the pork this time, not a big issue it was still good. The chips are to die for."}
{"text":"Terrible Service: When the server asked to take our drink order I asked \"What kind of tequila do you have for your margaritas?\" She said \"We don't have tequila.\" And that's it. I said, \"Ok then your margaritas are just virgin margaritas?\" She said, \"No, their pre-mixed.\" \"Ok, then, with what tequila??\" It was obvious it was my first time, why could she not explain the menu to me a little. I felt like I had to pry information from her. She was just all around inconsiderate and when she was not with her guests she was standing by the hostess stand chatting with the hostess and texting on her cell and laughing, so it seemed as though she had a personality, but didn't want to share it with us. When we were finished with our meal she said \"Sooo, Do you want the check now?\" She didn't offer dessert or ask if we needed another drink or anything at all!  The chorizo street taco was good, but the shrimp taco was super garlic-y. I like garlic, but it was too much. The tuna was over cooked and not good quality. I felt like I was eating rubber chicken from a fast-food joint. I took one bite out of the tuna taco and left the rest because it was not good. The server didn't even ask how everything tasted. It was probably obvious since I didn't eat any of it, but she didn't care. In my opinion, they are going to have to step their game up at Taco Local to keep up with their other competition in DTW. There are great restaurants in the area that I will go to every time over Taco Local from now on."}
{"text":"Tacos are hard to mess up, but service must be perfected.   They got rid of table service in favor of counter service with arrogant teenagers.   We had to stand at the host stand for five minutes before they let us know this.   Be prepared to clean your own table because they were overwhelmed on a moderately busy Sunday.  Like Starbucks I am usually offended by a place that expects tips before service is completed.   Other than this the food is good, tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Tried this place out the other day and I'm a big fan.  Not huge inside, so the seats probably fill up quickly.  We went around 6 on a Thursday evening and had to wait a bit to sit down, but there appears to be standing room tables to eat at as well.  Those might be really popular around 1am, if they're open that late. :-)  Cool vibe inside.  Beers and margaritas available, but not a huge selection....but that's ok.  This isn't really a drinking joint, by design I'd say.  Think food truck, without the truck (and I say that in the most positive way).  Started with some standard chips and salsa.  Chips were good, as was the basic pico salsa.  Nice and fresh.  Our table ordered up some tacos: chronic shrimp, shroomin', chorizo+beef, and steak.  Kids enjoyed the chorizo and steak tacos and asked for more, so the sausage must not have been TOO spicy.  I had the shrimp and shroomin.  Shrimp was great.  The sauce they were sauteed in was delish, and the toppings seemed really fresh and tasty.  I like the shroomin as well, but was less impressed.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it could have used something besides just the standard sauteed white-cap shroom.  I guess I think when a dish centers around the shroom, throw some variety in there.  Just my 2¢.  The staff kept our variety of mexi-beers coming in a timely manner, even with the busy room.  Pay attention when ordering, as there are a lot of options, but many have a little upcharge.  Not a big deal but it will add up if you order lots of yellowfin tacos, for example.  I wasn't surprised by the bill, though.  Overall, I love the joint.  It's like having a great food truck permanently in downtown Willoughby, and serves some delish casual food in a style that I think DTW lacked.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service is to slow. We had tacos that were bland.  The deserts are tasty though.  No liquor license here except for beer and ale."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've ever eaten. We tried the Willowbilly, wicked tuna, and Pierre Sanchez. They were incredible. We both ordered two and when we finished we had to order another round- they were just that good. I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm in Cleveland and save room for churros too"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in Lake County. Granted, that's a pretty low bar, but this place really is great! I was surprised how good the food was--I was expecting a pretty simple taco place, but they've gotten very unique (to the area) with the food and theme. It's no Momocho or Barrio, but it's not trying to be, and it's miles above any generic Mexican food place in the around.  Keep in mind these are street tacos they're selling, so they're small... As they're meant to be. Anyone complaining about the size doesn't understand what a street taco is. The prices are very good for what you're getting. I'm used to places around here serving way too much food, but this place gives a reasonable amount, it's definitely cheaper than anything in Cuyahoga County, and the food is worth it.  If you order their special tacos, they are larger and particularly tasty. I had a shrimp taco and tuna taco and loved them both. I was surprised by how well the tuna was cooked, still pink inside and not at all over done. I also recommend getting the chips, they're hot and fresh and delicious, and the dips we had were great as well. The guacamole was very well flavoured, and their hot sauce had a fantastic sweetness to it, sort of a Thai chili flavor. I've been craving it all week.  The one hing that would make this place better is a bar to sit at. The type of food they are serving is perfect for the bar top, and they have a fun selection of Mexican beer and Margaritas. I don't know if they have the space for it, but an outdoor patio bar would be particularly nice in the summer.  If I'm being honest, had they plopped this down in Ohio City or Cleveland Heights, I would probably only give it 3 to 4 stars, but Lake County is really s*** for food and we need to take baby steps here. So 5 stars it is, have a go at it!  I definitely recommend anyone try this place, especially if you don't feel like making the drive out to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food and a cool atmosphere it stops there. I've been here several times because like I said, great food. I wanted the service to get better but it just found different ways to be worse. Attitude, neglect and slow. I don't have time and don't want to spend my hard earned money to give this place another yet chance."}
{"text":"A taco joint that's trying to be something it is not. The idea is there, but the food tastes sub-par, presented poorly and inconsistent. Many times the food is over sauced or spiced. They need to take a few tips from barrio and perfect a few of their proteins and designate a few specialty tacos.   The crew seems a bit lackadaisical. It's much like the other \"local\" group restaurants. \"Just not good\". I feel that if they concentrate their efforts and make a few menu items great, rather than many items okay, they could have something special. I hope for Willoughby's only mod-mex taco joint to turn around!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Taco Local at ~8:00 on a Wednesday. There was a decent crowd - lots of families with kids and older couples. The majority of the tables were filled. The interesting thing about this restaurant is that a lot of the space is dedicated to take out. You can walk right up and order some tacos and walk right out if you want. I'm guessing this is meant to appeal to late night bar-goers, but they could probably use a couple extra tables in that space.   I was immediately impressed to see an outlet at my table. You never know when you're going to have a dead cell phone battery emergency. Then I was extra impressed by my server. She was super bubbly but not in an annoying way. She was able to answer all of my questions about veganizing the tacos and brought us drinks and guac with chips in a flash.   The guac was solid. Not the best I've ever had, but it was still good. The chips that came with it were a mix of corn and flour and were really fresh. You get more than enough chips so after we gobbled down our guac, we ordered some pico salsa. It was ok. Someone in the kitchen must have been a little heavy handed with the lime juice.  I ordered 3 tacos for $7.50. I got a beet and mushroom taco, a tofu taco, and an avocado taco. Veganized. (the taco shells normally have cheese on them and an aioli that isn't vegan) Admittedly, my tacos were a smidge sad without the cheese and the aioli. Next time, I'd get some guac or salsa on the side to add to them. My favorite taco, hands down, was the beet and mushroom one. I thought it was going to be weird but it was really good. The tofu taco tasted like a Bahn Mi because it had an Asian marinade and cilantro. I was a fan of that. The avocado taco was...a slice of avocado. Weep womp. Not overly exciting, but I like avocadoes so it was all good.  My fiance ordered two of the specialty tacos for $7.50. He got a beef taco (Pierre Sanchez) and liked it, but he really liked the Wicked Tuna taco. He especially liked the pineapple salsa that came on it.   I'm docking a star because the drink selection is a little limited. Right now they only have a handful of beers and some frozen margaritas in a slushee machine. I'm a margarita snob, and would have liked to have seen some other options, but...sometimes a cheap margarita is all you need when you're eating tacos.  Overall, we had some of the best tacos that we've had in a really long time and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Let's just say I really wasn't feeling Taco Local.   While the atmosphere was very open and easy-going, it just didn't pair up with the experience.  Our waitresses were super friendly, but that's just about the only real compliment I have for this place.  The first red flag probably should have been the lemonade my boyfriend received, it honestly tasted like someone squeezed a single lemon slice into a glass of water and called it a day. But as someone that isn't big into Mexican cuisine, I inquired about a few items on the menu.  After some thought, I decided to play it safe with the muchos nachos sans avocado sauce and sour cream -- what could go wrong?   A lot, apparently.   When it arrived at our table, it just looked like a massive pile of ingredients thrown together layer by layer.  My boyfriend and I both looked at each other in total disbelief.  If the waitress would have told me the portion size was so huge, I probably would have ordered something else.  The shredded chicken was incredibly bland making it difficult to enjoy the warm, crispy flour tortilla chips and pico.  I found myself digging all the way through just to get a taste of everything which only added to the disappointment.  But ultimately, I think the biggest let down is how there was hardly any queso or cotija/cheddar jack included in the dish -- like seriously, what kind of nachos aren't smothered in cheese?   I guess I'm thankful that the tortillas didn't get soggy and crumble too easily (probably since everything was so dry) because my boyfriend found them appetizing enough for leftovers later on in the afternoon.  We will probably visit again sometime seeing as it wasn't totally awful, but I will definitely be trying something different out."}
{"text":"If you are up for some fancy street tacos and over sized burritos then this is your place. I have had nothing but good experiences at Local Taco. The service was nice and our waitress  attentive. Our food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time.  I have had the street tacos and bomb burritos. If you go for the burritos I recommend getting them wet with sauce.  They offer red, green and queso. For me, the burrito is a little dry without it.  You can't go wrong for pork or chicken for your protein. The corn and flour chips are pretty darn good. A little thicker than the usual chips you get at other places.  The mango salsa and scorch the earth salsa are my go to choices.  I recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Although I enjoyed my food, the drinks were weak and overly sweet and the service was absolutely horrible. The server clearly didn't care and spent her whole shift gossiping with coworkers and texting. It took them 25 minutes just to get our chips and queso out and then another 40 minutes for our food. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place, so I thought I would check it out. I got a smokin bowl and it was just not good. Like a healthier version of a chipotle bowl. I'd much rather have eaten chipotle. I will say their chips and salsa were great and I especially liked the flour chips. However I will probably not go back again. I'd much rather go to coco locks or jalapeño loco."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  What I tried:  To start - The flour chips are AMAZING.  Do yourself a favor...just get your chips and salsa with all flour chips.  These are great!  They add some amazing flavor to them as well.  The salsa is also top notch.  I tried the pineapple and the pico.  The pico is what you would expect, but the pineapple is definitely special.  A little sweet to start then kick up a little spice at the end....great start to an amazing meal.  For the meal - 3 street tacos.  I opted for 3 different \"proteins,\" Chicken, steak, and shrimp.  All of them had just the right seasonings and cooked to perfection.  The shrimp was probably my favorite and paired with the steak, it was a great mix.  Closest to surf n' turf tacos around!    Definitely not a 1 \"$\" place, closer to 2 \"$\" for sure!  Just would LOVE to see a \"Taco Tuesday\" special!!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos, had the mahi mahi, tofu, and pork, for dessert you have to try the nutella fluff nachos omg delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day with my husband.  Was happy to see a taco joint come to the local area....unfortunately we were disappointed.  The tacos are so small and flavors are blah.  Got the 3 taco dinner...steak pork and shrimp...extra cost for steak and no options on what you want on the taco.   They came to the table and they were extremely small for the price...two biter tacos.   Flavors were blah and pretty much couldn't  tell the difference between tacos.   The burrito bowl was ridiculous.   They put a mixed green lettuce with carrots and cucumbers on one side of the bowl and rice and meat on the other...each in there own corner of bowl.  That's a burrito bowl?   Margarita was okay, but put in a plastic cafeteria glass.  I like mine in a margarita glass with salt.   Ordered a side of rice $2.  Literally 3 tbsp of rice...what a rip.   Chips and salsas did taste good.  This is an honest review...this placed needs to make changes...  Now my husband gave a honest review the other day..and yelp removed it.. We both like this place to succeed, but it needs many changes...in all honest it's not worth the money...hope yelp does not remove this..."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 3 children here tonight for the first time.  It was LOUD  and no air conditioning. Very uncomfortable.  Our waitress was RUDE as F*#*k from the get go!  We are friendly ppl and had simple questions about what certain things were since children often don't like Mexican food and there is not a children's menu.  The food......cold and salty. (Like our waitress!!) NONE of us liked our food enough to eat half of it. We left hungry and  Very disappointed!!!! We will sadly never go back and tell others not to go!  Did I mention that our bill total was $56.00!! For 2 adults  and 3 children (soda and lemonade!) for lunch!!!!  The waitress put the bill down and tried to slap on the charm for a tip.....if she's reading this....this is your tip! FIND A NEW JOB! You're not a ppl person!!!!!!!!! Maybe try the License bureau!!   I hope DTW will get a decent place in there at some point!!!"}
{"text":"so bad :( I grew up in willoughby but live in nyc now, so when I was home visiting my mom we decided to try this out. ugh it was so terrible. maybe I'm just used to real tacos but even the chips and guac were awful. stale chips and brown guac. I told our waitress and she said \"there's no way they're stale I just made them\"... made them? as if I'm dumb enough to not tell the difference between a bagged and fresh tortilla chip. give me a break. inedible. our waitress continued to be rude and dismissive until I told her I had severe allergies and was having trouble finding something on the menu to eat. I'm sorry but I'm the patron, you're the worker, and a terrible one at that. I ended up getting the saddest tacos I've ever seen omg. this is the LEAST authentic Mexican place I've ever been to. fried chicken taco? I know the owners of local tavern own this but it's obvious they need menu help. the add ons to the tacos are asinine. how do you have carnitas (which they just state as PORK because it's that unauthentic) and don't even have the option to add on pickled onions & red cabbage, they go hand and hand. the place was empty and it was lunchtime. the owners are clearly in over their heads. my moms tacos were awful too. we left and the waitress comped our bill. I wouldn't eat this again if I was blacked out drunk. I cannot say enough about how bad this food was."}
{"text":"Ouch! This place has been open long enough to start skimping on some quality. Their street tacos went up in price by $1 since our last visit, which is not the problem. It's the fact that they have increased the size of the tortillas to the conventional 6\" that are store bought and no longer their home made 3\" that are what really set this place apart. To make up for the extra size, worry not, they have added iceberg lettuce as a filler! Can't say I am impressed with the future of this place. One of those that start out strong and then get too big for their britches! Sad :("}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever eaten and I have lived in California. Shockingly good. The chronic shrimp and the mushroom were absolutely delicious. Good vibe in the place, but the food is the thang."}
{"text":"Walked in & short blond waitress told us to seat ourselves. Unfortunately every table was either occupied or full of dirty dishes from the previous customer. We then stood awkwardly in the dining area hoping to get noticed in vain. At that point we decided to clear dishes off of the table so we could sit down. The waitress came by several minutes later and took our drink order. We did not see the waitress again for another 15 minutes and when we finally did, we had to aggressively beckon her over to place a food order. Additionally, 3/4 of the hot sauce bottle assortments were either expired or crusted over with old sauce. My friends and I did not use these hot sauce bottles as they were quite disgusting. It would have been much easier to stay home cook tacos and drink my own beer. No plans for a future visit."}
{"text":"Finally open!! From the owners of Local Tavern.  Gotta try the chicken and steak street tacos!  Pineapple salsa is also great."}
{"text":"Our server, Jordi was amazing! So sweet and genuine and very attentive. Tried the Mahi Mahi... delicious! Affordable prices (similar to Chipotle)"}
{"text":"Amazing local taco place that has a socal style vibe. They have home made chips, both corn and flour, which are amazing. Strongly recommend all the guacs and salsas but the \"scorch the earth\" is my fave. Its pretty spicy and a little sweet. I usually get the street tacos, they have shrimp, 2 types of fish, and several pork chicken and beef and veggie options. They also have a series of specialty tacos burritos and bowls. Only dessert I saw is the sweet thing was churros. Over all one of my fave lunch spots, a must try if your on the east side."}
{"text":"Food is crap. You want it to be barrio and it doesn't even begin to come close. The service is terrible - oh you want a refill ....maybe if you walk up to the counter.   Disappointed and will never be back. Came when they first opened and hoped they would have ironed out the kinks..... Still crap.   Save your money and go to chipotle. Other than the interesting decor and the hipster vibe- this place is a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The only thing this place got right is the cheesy California surfer decor!!   My bestie & I wanted to try a new spot for lunch, so we decided to give it a try, it looked cool & is a great downtown location! When we went in on a Friday afternoon, we sat ourselves as the sign said. There were only customers at about 5 tables...so not at all busy. We sat at the least filthy table we could find....we went past a couple!! About about 5 mins after we sat down, the blonde waitress that had been texting the whole time finally acknowledged us....as she passed us by. I said maybe this isn't her table? She came back after giving us filthy menus & took our drink orders. She brought us out our margaritas after a good 10-15 mins, mine strawberry, hers a classic....mine was a frozen overly sweet margarita, but tolerable, as soon as she tasted hers, she said to me \"they don't usually put soda in margaritas right?!?\" I never heard of it, she had me taste it, tasted like straight Sprite. When we flagged down the waitress while she was again texting, she acted very annoyed my friend asked about what was in her drink, and said \"I don't know, our margaritas ALL come from bottles, they just freeze em if they want it frozen\".....yes a higher cost taco spot using bottled margaritas!!! They say genuine...last I knew, margaritas don't come pre-made in bottles...with almost NO alcohol at that....all sugar!  Well we reluctantly ordered street tacos, I ordered the chicken, my friend the chorizo. We heard the lady behind us complain of the \"couple of tablespoons of salsa\" that came with the chips & salsa they ordered, they were told to purchase more salsa if they wanted more, and she was rude to them too. So we didn't order any for ourselves.After another 10mins,we still hadn't gotten our water we asked for when we ordered the margaritas!!  When our tacos arrived another 15 to 20 mins after that, we looked at each other in disappointment...so little of anything on the street tacos....except iceberg lettuce, it was 1/2 that. Mine had about 2 teeny leaves of cilantro (my fave), and a bit of almost nonexistent seasoning on it, and the cheese sauce. Decent flavor, just hardly any of it!! My  friends \"in house made chorizo\" tacos looked like dog food from a can, and she said had NO flavor.....NONE!! She NEVER came back to ask if our food was ok, or to see if we wanted to order dessert, no water refill, nothing. Our waitress stood in the corner by the kitchen & chatted away with the cook, while she simultaneously texted away on her cell, and laughed & giggled on a call as she scooted past & dropped the check! Apparently she was the \"server\" (I use that term loosely bc everyone else in there, clearly received same cruddy service from her!!)   This was a Friday afternoon, downtown Willoughby was bustling....but no one was going in there!! Well, we NOW know why!! Most heinous service ever, place was dirty, bottled cocktails (still pretty sure they tried to pass off Sprite or 7Up as my friends margaritas!), food was subpar. Very disappointed. We will NEVER go back, unless you get 100% new staff. We hadn't read the Yelp or Facebook reviews....same complaints we had...and it's been going on since 2015 with the horrendous service....how do they stay open???Great spot downtown seemingly going to waste....literally!! Save your money folks or eat elsewhere please!!! Hands down worst service I have dealt with in my 44 years!!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.   This was my second trip to Taco Local. I remembered how good the chips and cotija cheese dip were, so I ordered them again. The chips are a cross between traditional tortilla chips as well as deep fried chips. They have a light seasoning on them, which adds to the taste. As a cheese connoisseur, you won't be disappointed!   Last visit, I ordered the street tacos, which were just ok. This time I opted for the muchos nachos and the bomb burrito. The portions are massive! For $7.50, the muchos nachos are a great deal. They are even listed as an item option for 2 people. The portions are absolutely massive. I ordered it with extra cotija cheese.   The bomb burrito that I ordered was wet with the cotija cheese. Again, the portion is very very large. I was disappointed with the beans inside. Next visit, if I order this again, I would ask them to leave the beans off.   I would have to agree with other's comments regarding the staff. Both visits, the service was dodgy, but this time at least my food was much more satisfying."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch and had three street tacos, which were so good I ordered three more. A little lacking on beverages (just beer and frozen margaritas, as others have mentioned) but I'm not sure it really matters because the place is literally surrounded by bars and pubs. Come in here for the food, have a nice draft cerveza, and leave happy! Great guacamole, and the atmosphere to go with it. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love their bowls & nachos! TL adds to what Downtown Willoughby has to offer in the food world."}
{"text":"Foe the love of Dumbledore PROVIDE COMPLIMENTARY CHIPS AND SALSA. Every other taco place does it. Just do it. You charge $2.50 for it, then supply half the salsa needed for the amount of chips you put on the table, THEN you charge  $1.50 for \"double salsa\". Really? JUST GIVE US THE CHIPS AND SALSA, DUDE."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place because it sounds really cool , but I was pretty disappointed. The food was decent at best, not the normal excited you get from indulging in tacos. The \"melted cheese\" on the shells was actually this funky burnt brown layer stuck to the shell. I wanted to like this place but don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went a couple years ago on Cinco de Mayo. Awful service, not allergy friendly, but I did discover my one true love -- Tajin seasoning. Puréed pineapple salsa which I hated and the margarita I got was just OK. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I can see why some folks give this four stars. The food's fresh and if you like the style, it's great.  I had the chicken nachos. It was a large basket with a heaping mound of shredded chicken, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, black beans, cheese and \"avocado sauce.\"   You'll note I said \"chopped tomatoes.\" That's on the menu as pico, but my impression was that if it was not entirely tomatoes, it was close. It didn't add a lot of flavor. And the avocado sauce -- definitely not guacamole -- was on the bland side, too.  That put a lot of pressure on the chicken to provide the flavor. It did all right, but overall this didn't provide the heat I prefer.   The nachos -- and, I gather, other chip-based choices -- come with a mix of corn and flour chips. In other words: actual chips and dry, tasteless crackers.   If you're looking for a Cali-Mex place and your definition of that is mild, fresh, light -- this would be for you. If you're looking for something more like Tex-Mex or authentic Mexican, not so much."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Fast and always hot. Plus they have a late night menu that is basically already made. Nice for a late night meal"}
{"text":"This place is like a cross between a Chipotle and a Barrio.  Its small inside but I like the atmosphere, its fun.   The food is good. Very fflavorful.  We started with some chips and dip and everyone ordered something different on the menu and everyone liked their food.  I really liked the pineapple/hot salsa. Very good. If they sold that in a jar, I'd pick some up to take home. Queso was good too.   Other than that, I had the sandwich that was on the menu. It was good, but based on the burritos, tacos and the bowl, I think I would have rather had one of those items which I tasted and I think were just a bit better than what I ordered.   I also had a frozen margarita. Although I am usually more a fan of a 'rita on the rocks, the frozen one here was nice and refreshing.   I think this place is gonna do great in the summer and next time I am on the East Side, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great fast tacos and taco bowls.  If on the weekend evenings, best to get there before the rush that occurs when the bars close.   Cute hipster type of place, but we enjoyed our late night snack very much.  Good place to try if you like tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"Stylized, updated and flavorful tacos, burritos and bowls are a nice twist on \"mexican\" food (the only thing really mexican about it is that they use tortillas and corn chips), but the service is slow.   Plus, who wants to pay for chips and salsa?   But they do play good music!"}
{"text":"I love the tacos!  They are the perfect portion and the choices are great.  My favorites are the steak, beet and mushroom, and the mahi mahi.  The avocado is another good one so long as they are fresh.  The last ones I had wasn't so good.   The nachos are also a great choice.  As well as the seven layer dip. My husband ordered the bowl, and he wasn't thrilled with his choice. My only issues are the ventilation (you might smell when you leave), seating (not a lot of seating) and some of the servers aren't the friendliest.   But, if you live tacos, check them out, try the many protein options!"}
