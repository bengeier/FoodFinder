{"text":"I ordered a cappuccino with soya milk. The best I have had in Montreal so far. Coffee lovers must try this gem."}
{"text":"Haven't tasted it yet, but i already like it because my sister talks about it so much"}
{"text":"It's definitely a happening place but don't go if you want to have a conversation. The noise level is way too high. Cute decor. Food was disappointing by our table of 4 who eat out regularly. I hear lunch sandwiches are very good. I may be back for lunch but not for dinner"}
{"text":"I remember very well now, why I always avoided this particular joint.    For a place that seem to operate within the Fashion district-  and I assume they make big $$. I strongly suggest to the owners to invest 20$ in the hygiene and look of the place. Feels like you're eating in a 3rd world country cheap noisy cafeteria.  Yes they might have good coffee but if you decide to eat there....they  will trick you into taking a plate and will slide in side orders. They will not be shy to charge extra ....so be careful. Portions are small but taste is ok. If you want something,  you'll have to chase for the waiters -  they will never make the effort to ask if you need anything else.  Other than that- its good place to keep up with the industry gossips or the annoying sounds of the sport tv's."}
{"text":"Today I have my first  experience ever at Cafe Gentile. It was not until googling the place to find out where it was that I knew about it's \" institution \" level in Montreal. So now I know I'm heading to a spot that's been making sambos + coffee for 48 years. No pressure right ? Ha Ha .  I think my roomie and I got in at just the right time after the bizzy lunch rush. Ordered a latte , obviously , yum! It's all about the foam they say and was that foam on point ! I loved the the cocoa on it , it made it look so cute.    Now onto to the grub ! The menu was extensive and I really didn't bother reading it all because I knew I wanted to have something classic , a staple , the breaded chicken sandwich. I love cesar salad alot so I regret not getting it on the side but I went with the pasta because the server suggested it as an option. If I were to go back ( and the chances are good ) I'm getting cesar salad !!!!!!   SO the sandwich was great chicken moist and krispy yummy. PAsta was good but like I said I had buyer's remorse because of not gettting the cesar salad. We had iced teas also which come in this super cool styrofoam cup that was so cool.  It was like I was getting a fountain soda at a truck stop or something. Loved it.   Overall I was a huge fan of the decor and branding of the whole spot. Attention to detail was high. Gentile everywhere on everyone  super love the brand rep."}
{"text":"Seriously the best lunch you could ever ask for. Fresh, delicious and the owners/staff are gems. You can tell they really care about satisfying their customers! I was curious if they would be able to do it as well as they do it on Parc, and with no surprise they do!!  Busy and you may have to wait but it's so worth it and the service is quick.  AND THEY NOW HAVE DINNER TOO !!!!!!! Best news ever"}
{"text":"Une institution du café"}
{"text":"The famous Cafe Gentile has recently opened a new location on Ste Catherine street in Westmount and judging by the line up at the door it has been very well received.    This spot is a great addition to the neighbourhood which lacks good quality, reasonably priced authentic options for lunch. My first experience here was excellent. We did have to wait a couple of minutes for a table as the place was 100% full, but the service was quick,  the food was great and the atmosphere was lively and enjoyable.  I will definitely be a regular.    I order the Tunisian Tuna Sandwich with a Ceasar salad on the side. The sandwich was excellent with the perfect amount of mayo, some egg and a bit of spice to give it a great flavour. My friend had one of the daily pasta specials which was great. We topped it off with a couple of cookies, the biscotti is made by the owner's mom, and a latte.   I have to admit that I'm generally not a big fan of biscotti,  but I really enjoyed it here. It was crispy on the exterior,  but when you bite into it the core was just ever so slightly chewy,  which I really enjoyed.    Cafe Gentile has been consistently busy for lunch since it opened. Today we arrived at 12:40 and left slightly after 1:30 PM and there was a line the entire time. So you need to be prepared to wait a few minutes when you arrive. The staff does a good job of politely keeping the table turnover at a good rate, so you should not have to wait to long. The only issue  could be if you are a group of 5 or more as there are only a couple of spots in the restaurant that can accommodate large groups.   They also do takeout."}
{"text":"I went there at around 8. My friend told me that they have better food selection at noon, but I took a $20 pasta and wasn't satified because I was still very hungry. price wasn't worth the food to be honest.   Service was meh, the waitress was super nice at first but she changed her vibe right after we have all ordered our plates.. which is odd. (Maybe it's because we didn't order any drinks or she had a bad day). I would come back but during lunch time instead. Their desert seems to be delicious from what I've seen from my neighbor table. PS- they have a terrasse!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and great, coffee is the best in Montreal. Always busy from Monday to Saturday, so you know this place is happening. Waiters are fast and always there to serve you. If you haven't been here yet then I suggest you click the directions button as your done reading this."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble in this place for lunch. They have a good variety of items on the menu with pretty affordable prices. Good portion sizes and friendly service. Food was tasty and fresh. We came in after the lunch rush and the dining area was still pretty full. They also offer outdoor seating. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Family business that was started by the father in the late fifties is now owned and operated by two italian brothers. It has an old hang out feel to it and a billiards table in the back.  I had a double espresso and a breaded chicken sandwich. Both were excellent in the category of diner type food."}
{"text":"Popped in to try this new spot for lunch.  Directly across the street from westmount square, it's a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  Casual Italian, featuring mainly sandwiches and salads, with a pasta, veal and fish of the day available as well.  Super cute retro decor and friendly service.  Excellent cappuccino, one of the best I've had in Montreal.  I had the \"Pavarotti\" sandwich, grilled chicken, tomato pesto, avocado, caramelized onions and cheese.  It was a touch salty for my taste, but I'm very sensitive to salt... otherwise delicious and very fresh ingredients.    They're also open for breakfast and dinner and have a selection for take out as well.  The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was an ugly red trucker hat on prominent display over the cash, marring an otherwise charming decor.  Will certainly be back for more of that awesome coffee and to try things out at dinner time."}
{"text":"Lunch time down at the Garment District of Montreal included a visit down at Cafe Gentile. It's a busy but cozy spot to grab a bite, especially if you work nearby. Buddy and I grabbed some steak and cheese sandwiches, an order of burger slides, and some iced teas [by mistake, I'll try their coffee one day] to go. Overall, great food even with a 15 min walk down to the park (bread still had that good crunch to it)."}
{"text":"Went for dinner one time at this downtown location and was surprised... it's day and night when comparing the two Cafe Gentiles! Great food on both ends however.  For dinner at the downtown location I ordered the bruschetta to start things off and split the Sunday Lunch for Two which consisted of meatballs, sausages, and beef ribs laying on top of a bed of pasta with tomato sauce and cheese. Bruschetta was good, and that sausage was great! Of course to wash it all down I took the classic Gentile iced tea.  Again, such a difference in both locations or at least lunch and dinner wise but great food throughout. If you're looking for a more casual visit, go for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Though I prefer the old school location on parc, the new cafe gentile is super stylish and the food is solid. Make sure to have their famous ice tea when u go. I have been known to sometimes just stop in for one. The menu changes at night and gets a little more formal. Lunchtime it's mostly sandwiches and salads all really good and tasty."}
{"text":"Very charming Italian Café !!! Perfect for an elegant and simple pasta dinner with a glass of wine"}
{"text":"Food is classically Italian and ridiculously delicious. Maybe even better is the service, full of great people who really want to make sure you enjoy your meal. Nothing there was anything less than perfect."}
{"text":"Went back today for lunch and it's just way better than at dinner time. The service is still slow but the waitress was nice. The prices are way more reasonable and the portions are great.

{"text":"Paid 22$+ for a sandwich that is smaller than a  junior chicken at McDonald's, and at least the chicken at McDonald's is not pre-cooked. The pasta on the side wasn't enough even for a kid! I don't mind paying a lot for a value but this is a total ripoff."}
{"text":"Soo good! We went for dinner on a Friday night around 8:30. Waited for an hour before we got seated, it was pretty packed & they don't take reservations. The good news is that I left this family run italian cafe with the same satiety I feel leaving my grandma's house. The food is so fresh & homemade. Great portions & service.  We had their homemade ricotta cheese & eggplant parmigiana to start. For the main dish we had the veal parmigiana with smoked caciacavallo & matchstick fries as well as the seared cod with roasted cauliflower & fennel puree. Their whole dessert menu is insaaane. It includes 3 homemade gelato flavors, homemade tiramisu & biscotti & many more. Gradually working on trying each & every one."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner,  as it was suggested by friends in Montreal. Pasta was ok, and it was all homemade however, undercooked and chewy,  plus I think our sever forgot to hit pick up,  as we waited for a long time for the food.  Apps were great,  and the famous meatballs was definitely the standout. This is their second location,  and they've been around since the 1950's."}
{"text":"I had never been to Gentile but all my friends had been raving about it on the daily. So when I finally made it I had pretty high expectations.  We sat on the terrasse but the entire time I was staring st the inside! The walls the bar the pictures, everything is stunning and beautiful.   I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered a quick sandwich and a macchiato. The macchiato was delicious, not sure what kind of coffee beans they use but I really enjoyed that it was simple flavourful and not overly bitter like other \"fancy\" coffee shops.   The sandwich was a recommendation from the waitress called the Pavarotti. It was a bit pricy at 12$ but delicious none the less.   All in all my first experience at Gentile was charming. The decoration was probably my favourite part. I will definitely be returning with an appetite next time, because I want to try more of their food.   OH also !!! Try the iced cap! They put gelato into it OMG MY friend had it and I was incredibly jealous that I didn't order it!"}
{"text":"Excellent neighbourhood cafe  Cafe Gentile may seem a little chaotic when you're in there, but the food and service are great. The specials are fresh and tasty and the value is excellent. The ambiance is akin to an Italian social club but that makes for some interesting conversations going on.  The food is southern Italian and well prepared. Whether you're there for lunch or a coffee, you'll get great service and fair prices. They do not take credit cards but there is an ATM in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is awesome. The coffee is to die for. If you want an awesome lunch or coffee break to to Gentiles. Nice decor too."}
{"text":"A cool, trendy lunch spot right across from Westmount Square has opened its second location. I ordered the Pavarotti sandwich (chicken sandwich) and the iced cappuccino that has a shot of gelato in it. Both great, good, friendly and speedy service and nice terrasse. Would go back. Great place to people watch too."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place, I've only ever come here for dinner but I've ordered many different things from the mafaldine to the kale salad and everything has been equally delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is fantastic and not at all a pretentious ambiance. Highly recommended, this will also become your new favorite neighbourhood spot!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is close to my hood, the place is great. One of the best sandwiches in town...bravo boys"}
{"text":"My \"secondi\" visit, was much more enjoyable than my first and for several reasons. For one the company, the food a close second, and rounding out the accolades - much improved service; especially the spirit of our server.  Perhaps a sunny morning is a better time to find smiles all around, then an in between lunch and dinner lull - when everyone needs a good coffee. Va bene.  Speaking of which this they have and in spades. I was recommended, and followed suit with a cup o' Macchiatoni (has more of a ring to it than Joe, *not sure if I have the spelling right, but is supposedly a tall Macchiato).  On the grub side of things, I happened to see someone eating what looked like a frittata, but turned out to be a signature omelette with eggplant, spinach, zucchini, onions, and brick cheese (white), plus sliced tomatoes and olive oil on the side (I usually ask for them instead of potatoes, but here it gladly just is). Before overdoing the focus on the omelette. Its ingredients were very refreshing - as you rarely find that combo elsewhere. I'd get it again and recommend it for sure.  The only petite woops, was my toasted bagel on the side was forgotten, however it came right out after I reminded the server.   In true Italian fashion my breakfast mate (who had recently taken a barista'ing course) ordered a second coffee before heading out. I felt a little un-Italian, but was pleased that my hand was not shaking from the caffeine   As I work my way up to multiple cafés, Gentile Café definitely is at the ready.  Now I guess I've got to try them for dinner too. Ciao."}
{"text":"I went to cafe gentile twice in one month. The first time my boyfriend and i shared the bruschetta with feta. This was amazing! I've never had bruschetta with cheese before. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised coz cheese makes everything taste better. The bread was crunchy and the tomatoes were cold and fresh and the feta added the right amount of saltiness to it. Then we had the caprese salad. This was a bit disappointing for me. I felt like it was bland so I had to add salt to it and i wish the cherry tomatoes had been colder. On the menu it said that it comes with olives but I did not see any on the plate. We also shared two sandwiches. I picked the Scallopini sandwich and my bf picked the prosciutto cheese sandwich. The Scallopini was prob one of the best sandwiches I ever had and I'm really not a sandwich kinda girl. The Scallopini is made with veal, white wine, sauteed mushrooms, eggplant, red peppers, arugula, Parmesan cheese, and prosciutto with a balsamic reduction. Now that's a sandwich! I loved that it was warm and I loved the sauteed onions and mushrooms with the white wine sauce. I wish there had been more prosciutto because I shared half of the sandwich with the boyfriend and I barely got any. :(  The second sandwich contained prosciutto, lettuce, tomato, eggplant, olive oil, oregano, and bomba, which is like a spread. The sandwich was decent but it wasn't anything special and I felt it was plain. I prefer warm, fancy sandwiches. For dessert we wanted a cannoli but the waiter recommended us this other italian dessert instead. It was basically like a soft donut with a hole in the middle, covered with white powdered sugar and inside the donut was the same filling as a cannoli. It was very good and light. Too bad I do not remember the name of it. :(  The second time I went with my colleagues. This time I had the caesar salad with the STK sandwich. The sandwich contained steak, cheese, arugula, caramelized onions, mushrooms, eggplant, goat cheese, with a balsamic Reduction and bomba. It was good but I preferred the Scallopini. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this cafe.  I'm also curious about their dinner menu.... hmmm next time..."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from fiends we popped in on a Friday for lunch. The first thing you see is a deli-style display counter, but there is actually quite a bit of seating. Not enough though, this place is very popular! We hit a slight lull and get a table right away. The line seems to move well as staff, although never rude or rushing anyone, do keep the plates moving and the bills arriving. We were there for over an hour and then noticed the line getting longer so we left so that others could enjoy the great food. The staff were so warm and friendly and helpful - not always the case in popular, busy places! The menu is huge! I am a vegetarian and there were so many options for me - salads, wraps, sandwiches, gourmet sandwiches, I am used to just a few \"options\" and this was so exciting! My friend eats very clean - she is a nutritionist, and she loved the menu - you can really indulge or go really healthy. Nice! Everything was delicious and I am eager to return for dinner - there evening menu looks very promising!"}
{"text":"We're first time visitors to Montreal and were looking for a restaurant with local flavor and not a tourist attraction. We were all glad we found Cafe Gentile! Every taste of every dish - all the way from the olive oil to the espresso- was absolute perfection. We highly recommend the homemade gnocchi and eggplant parmigiana. Any lover of authentic Italian food will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One great cup of espresso. Only when I was a block away and took my first sip did I realize the gem I had stumbled upon.   Way preferable to Starbucks and second cup, the other two nearest shops."}
