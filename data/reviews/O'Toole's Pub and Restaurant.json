{"text":"Rustic-looking neighborhood sports bar with a pretty extensive beer selection and some good food selections. Not posh but not quite a dive either. The customers seem to be mainly from the neighborhood, but you won't feel unwelcome if you're from somewhere else. Giant TV screens all around the bar for a good view of the Cavs or Browns; crowded but not overcrowded during games, it does get loud like most sports bars do. 
They seem to be making an effort to provide interesting food selections as a way of differentiating themselves from the many, many other area bars. Foodwise, I am not really into tacos at a bar but they did recently start carrying Bobo's Smokin' BBQ on Sundays, so I am most likely to go get me some of that, since it's very good."}
{"text":"Food is delicious (anything on the menu is great--- love the pesto chicken and burgers!) and bartenders are amazingly attentive. Urvashi, the owner, is often there and she is the best!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Lakewood. Bar area is spacious and inviting. Servers were all super nice and ready to please. Met the owner. She went out her way to talk with us and explain all the new updates. We even met an Irish waitress who we could have listened to all night."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and we hit their Taco Thursday - 2 for $7. Generally tacos are priced at $5 a taco and while delicious, I would not pay that money for a small taco. 
Also, we tried the Tabasco Butter Confit Wings and Mango Habanero. I don't think either had the kind of heat we were hoping for but the meat was good. And FYI, the Tabasco wings will come out darker than you'd think, but if they come out black, someone messed up. See attached pictures before and after. 
Last but not least they had a live band tonight and it was just right for the atmosphere. I'd definitely check these guys out again.
They also do catering."}
{"text":"The cooks are inconsistent and unprofessional and the kitchen hours change. I have gotten good food and horrible food. The bar owners seem like unprofessional amateurs. I have seen the woman owner scream at and even grab her bartenders aggressively in front of customers. I feel bad for the bartenders there."}
{"text":"Yikes! I ordered two tacos--beef and tofu--and couldn't finish the tofu one because it was drenched in some kind of oil. It was literally seeping out of the tortilla. Once I got home, I spent the rest of the night with a very upset stomach. I definitely do NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was there with my best friend, and we ordered 2 dozen (one for each of us) of the wings during happy hour (50? wings).... please try their Captain Morgan BBQ sauce... you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great drinks and food! The kitchen just opened and their unique mix of irish and indian is definitely something to try!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for weekly live music, great food, and awesome libations.  Make sure you ask for Molly.  She's by far the best server in town."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The outside looks like any other bar in Lakewood but once you walk in you get a completely different feel. The ceilings are high and the decor is very Irish-feeling (hey it's an Irish bar!) so it was very welcoming. I didn't eat here (kitchen opened at 4pm I believe) but the menu's pricing was on the lower end which I can appreciate. They had a surprisingly good selection for beer and im they were all priced low. The beer was cold and overall for a brew and a shot it cost me about $5 so you can't beat it. Bartender was attentive and the bathrooms were clean. The regulars all seemed nice and there was no record scratch when I walked in (always a plus). They seemingly have live music on the weekends and throughout the week as well as Sunday brunch. Overall I had a very pleasant experience here and will definitely be back someday!"}
{"text":"I live very close to this bar and I tried it when they started serving food. The inside is pretty dive-y, and I knew from seeing the same few people stumble out every day that it had it's share of regulars. My friends and I went on a Saturday afternoon and were the only people not drinking ourselves into oblivion at the bar. The menu looked good, almost like something you'd find at a higher end bar. One friend ordered wings, they were alright but it's tough to screw up wings. Another friend got a fish sandwich, he said it was decent but he wouldn't order it again. He asked for ketchup and apparently they don't carry any name brand stuff, they make their own. Heinz would have been better because their ketchup was a little \"off.\" So that was weird. I had a salad with steak, and to my chagrin they gave me some sort of ground beef atrocity on top of lettuce. I gritted my teeth and finished it because I walk by this place every day, but I was not pleased with my meal. I don't think I've ever had a disappointing salad before, but there's a first time for everything I guess. 

Final verdict: I already knew this place was questionable, and now I have a reason not to go back. The menu was a little too ambitious, and the execution was poor. As a bar to go get drunk at? Not bad. But you'd be better off walking up the street to Grab n go Pizza if you get hungry (side note: I have seen regulars do this before)"}
{"text":"We were at O'Toole's last night for the first time for their Trivia Night.  It was a good crowd and we had a great time.  The waitress was very attentive and are drinks were always refilled.  The only thing we ordered was boneless wings (which were good) and we plan to go back to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Bomb wings! Big, juicy and delicious! Will definitely be coming here for more. Bartender was extremely attentive during the busy osu game and beer selection was pretty good."}
{"text":"I'll give three stars. Meh. Nice enough place but beer was warm from the taps. Selection, again, meh. I returned my warm draft in exchange for a fridge cooled bottle. It was cold but about a year past it's date. Not good for a Cleveland bar serving a year old bottle of a local Cleveland beer...  people seemed ok but it's a bar. Get the beer right first."}
{"text":"I came here because my friend was performing some standup comedy. I ordered one chicken tandoori taco and another tofu vegetable taco, both underwhelming. The tofu was fried but not seasoned at all. My dark and stormy was meh as well. You can find much better ones at at the Fairmount."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best boneless wings I have ever had. They are becoming kind of an issue for me, especially considering I can get them via Uber Eats. These aren't your typical boneless wings, they are juicy, white meat chicken. Perfect amount of breading, incredible sauces, and you get a pound of them!? 
I have also dined in for happy hour, & it's your typical townie sports bar. They have ample tv's + a large projection on the wall. Keno, darts, and touchtunes. Not a bad place to hang out and service wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"My husband has been going there for the acoustic jam nights on Tuesdays.  He kept saying their chicken was amazing.  I have to says that their boneless wings are THE BEST EVER!!!!!! The flavors and the crunch are flawless.  Pair it with their homemade chips and you have a mind-blowing meal!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Very cute bar inside!  There was live acoustic music.  The owners were extremely nuceThe food also looked pretty good, I will have to try it next time I am there!"}
{"text":"Great place to spend an evening!  Food is delicious, and the staff is extraordinarily pleasant and helpful!"}
{"text":"I had rated a 5 over a year ago but need to revise down.  Inconsistent hours, especially the kitchen, good luck figuring those hours out.  $8 for 6 wings?  Look they are good but not that good.  Strange prices for beer, ordered one and it was something odd like $3.17...don't get it.  

Also it's been two years, fix the ATM or get rid of it.  I would think a functioning ATM would help sales."}
{"text":"Great spot with a fun and energetic scene. Good live music on Monday evenings and a great selection of beer and food. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The only reason im giving them 2 stars instead of just one is because their food isn't bad but good luck ordering it. Earlier today I tried to place an order and she said one second and set down the phone. The whole time I could hear her joking with people and chatting it up while i sat on the line.. After 10 min I just hung up. Later my boyfriend decided he wanted food from there so he called and placed the order and waited the 15 minutes she said it would take for the food to be ready. When he shows up the girl forgot to put the order in and didn't even apologize! Clearly did not care one bit. The food sat in the window and had a customer pack it for her! Awful service!"}
{"text":"So this is my second update.  I've checked in here 19 times so I come here some.  Its the closest to my house and I will just come for drinks now.  The Happy Hour specials are AGAIN changed.  The website still says tacos and wings but its not.  They do have craft specials for 3.00 which is nice but they force you to buy that crap pizza from up the block.  Its terrible.  I actually bit the bullet and came tried it again.  The 9\" was barely a personal pizza and ALL DOUGH.  The wings looked good but they gave me no sauce (which I ordered) and wrong dip.  Everything was walked through the back door by some dude from the pizza shop.  Not even made AT THE BAR IM SITTING AT!  And what happened to the free pizza being out at happy hour?  Yet ANOTHER thing gone.  I told the poor bartender I didn't want any of the garbage food and just payed for my beer and left.  I felt bad so I tipped her well and walked to the Lizard and got a GOOD pizza.  I felt bad because all she has in there was a few random day drunks.  So inconsistent and misleading the happy hour is.  They even got rid of Mossy so there is no reason to see bands here, really.  Sucks that a whole group of us pre-game at the house and will walk right past this possible goldmine to go to another place due to it doesn't know what the hell it wants to be.  Lakewood has a lot of Irish bars.  Lakewood has a lot of sports bars.  Lakewood has a lot of good happy hours.  This place does none of them right or with consistency.  Its like an Irish cross dresser that's got a sports and cover band fetish..."}
{"text":"WE LOVE  O'Tooles!!! The food and drinks are amazing...Except, when they are really busy there is not enough staff to cover drinks, and food appropriately."}
{"text":"Fish and chips dinner really hit the spot on this cold winter evening. Hubby had Irish lamb meatballs, great comfort food that was gone before I had a chance to taste....nice relaxing meal...."}
