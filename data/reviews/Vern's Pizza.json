{"text":"Hand's down, the best pizza I have ever had! Had the T-Rex (Meatlovers) and couldn't believe the amount of meat piled under the cheese! the crust was cooked to perfection and the sauce had a slightly sweet tang to it-complimented the pie quite well. At first the prices may put one off, but with the amount of toppings and wholesome goodness, it's totally worth every penny. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Tons of toppings on the single (not 2 for 1s) pizzas. Take out and delivery including single slice purchases in store. No dine in."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I decided to give Vern's a try.  Honestly, the pizza is ok at best. I'm not impressed... But it wasn't horrible. Maybe I didn't enjoy it as much bc I ordered the plain pizza, and with toppings it might of been better."}
{"text":"Victor's review does not surprise me. Verns is a franchise, and because franchisee's tend to get completely plundered by the company they represent, it is more lucrative to lose a $40/order/month customer instead of comp'ing a new pie. Sad.  This place is EXPENSIVE, but you get a big thick pie with fresh ingredients. I am a big guy and can normally scoff down a medium pizza by myself after work. I got the large, and I had leftovers for two (2) days. I got the super spicy pizza and it was actually spicy (I have a high spice tolerance). The Jalapenos were FRESH (i.e. bright green instead of dark green) and I think the pizza put on too much spice just for the sake of putting on too much spice. But, whatevz, I'm just sayin' that to compensate for my moment of spice-weakness.  Get cheaper, and I'll be forever loyal. Until then, this is a once-a-quarter luxury. And I don't think that's such a bad thing."}
{"text":"Sometimes fussy flatbread with arugula, prosciutto, & dollop of cheese hits the spot but when you're HUNGRY!... We found Vern's ;)  I  SK"}
{"text":"The pizza is very good.  Seems expensive but you get square pizza and it's thick so it may not be for the quick & cheap pizza nights but it's worth it.  Lots of toppings held together with loads of cheese.  They don't skimp on the sauce either.  Have napkins available.  They also have a good selection of speciality pizzas and include some things that other places don't.  For example the cheese burger pizza has pickles.  PICKLES!  It makes a world of difference if a pizza is supposed to be like a cheese burger.  Overall the other food items are very good as well.  Pretty standard fare but tasty   Now the drawbacks.  I ordered pickup in the afternoon on my way home from work.  They never started making the pizza until I arrived.  This kind of defeats the whole point of calling ahead and leaves your customer sitting around for an extra 20 minutes.  Next this location is kind of old feeling and rundown so it comes off as dirty even though it wasn't.  Just that overall feeling.  Lastly the cook went from running the till and handling money to handling food with no gloves, no hand washing etc.  I noticed this after he processed my payment and he started on my pizza and then mid way through he rang another customer up and handle their cash payment then went pack to finishing my pizza.  TL;DR Food is pricey but excellent and worth it. Need to improve pick up/online ordering. This location feels rundown & dirty. Clean kitchen policies need to be followed by food handlers."}
{"text":"I have ordered this pizza on several locations and have never been disappointed. Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth the money. We live a long way from Vern's, and have a $9 dollar delivery charge, but we lessen it by coordinating a 3 neighbor order. This is a once a month thing for us. If you are going to give it a chance, go for the double double, it is our family favorite."}
{"text":"Vern's has decent pizza. Honestly though, Sammy's world's greatest pizza is so close to Vern's that you're really sooo much better off just going there instead. Vern's is like the cheap knock off version of Sammy's pizza."}
{"text":"Not great.. Youll hear alot about how thick they are. But its just cheap undercooked meat that is always cold. And the dough shows up undercooked aswell. Get sammys pizza if one of the cheap chains wont do for ya.   For the price of verns. Its sub par at best."}
{"text":"This is not good pizza; as mentioned in other reviews - saltier than anything I have ever had. The pizza was soggy and the cheese had no crispiness or golden brown bubbly bits like on a really good pizza.  Would not recommend even if desperate.  Dr. Oetker makes better pizza and that is saying a lot!"}
{"text":"They make the best cheeseburger pizza I've ever had. The Reason? Pickles Dont look at me like that, its delicious. You gotta trust kids!"}
{"text":"Enough salt on the Hawaiian pizza to shrink all the slugs in Vancouver.  Couldn't taste the meat, pineapple or sauce, just an overwhelming great salt lake - worst pizza ever"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but the quality is there.  Reminds me of my Uncle's pizzeria."}

{"text":"I normally don't like the \"pepperoni\" found on most Canadian pizzas. It is a floppy, processed, bologna-like substance.  Vern's is no exception to this aberration ... but for some reason, when it is piled-on the way Vern's does, I actually don't mind it. I even like it.  Vern's \"regular\" style of pizza is known for it's EXCESS of toppings. Mostly stacked underneath the cheese. Each slice is as if someone stopped by the local grocery store deli and stuffed a fistful of their lunchmeat into your piece of pizza.   The prices are not great, but you always have the option of buying by the slice if you just need a quick, meaty fix."}
