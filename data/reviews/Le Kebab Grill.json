{"text":"mediocre, if food they serve is good- its good timing otherwise u  will regret it-- same thing with the staff - mediocre"}
{"text":"Many more visits later and I still have enjoyed every meal here. The staff is excellent and the food is always tasty. I love eating here and plan to be a regular for many more years."}
{"text":"A restaurant I have been visiting for the last 4 years!! From The time I set foot in the US from India. I can easily say this is one of the best restaurants in charlotte!!  Shawarma special on hummus is my favorite. my mouth is watering as I am typing :-) Arayes, mixed grilled kebab, falafel, ful muddamus are some of my other favorites!!! I don't experiment too much with other items on menu as have never got bored with the above!!!! Knafeh is the desert I would die for :-) The Ramadan buffet they had was heavenly!!! I ended up going thrice in 3 weeks!!! I didn't give it 5 stars as the service still needs some improvement!!!  Wish you could add few new items to menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came here with my family and our server and the rest of the staff were super nice! She gave us tons of recommendations (she had good taste in food tbh) and we were satisfied with the ones we went with. The menu is reasonably priced for the portion and quality of the dish. The restaurant is also halal:)"}
{"text":"I've been there several times and it's been a very good experience. Food is very authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here on a friends recommendation and it was awesome!  Had a chicken wrap (2 large sandwiches) served with fries.  Also had a bowl of the tabouli salad.  Everything was delicious!  Served quickly and politely.  I recommend going when they are not busy."}
{"text":"Food is ok, wait time is horrible. Doesn't matter weekdays or weekend, doesn't matter you call ahead or order on spot.   You are going to sit n wait n wait... I stop by sometime but prefer to use la shish instead.. Much better food, better prices and faster service. Total waste of time ... They need to learn the importance of time"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  We had a yogurt dip with olive oil and pita bread for appetizer.  It was very creamy and good.  The owner was there and he was very attentive and brought out some free falafel for us to sample as well as a small order of hummus. Both were very good.  I had the lamb kabobs with salad and rice.  The lamb was very tender and the flavor was just right.  The seasoning was not over powering.  My wife had the chicken shawarma and I think it may have been even tastier than the lamb.  It came with a little cup of this garlic paste that complimented the dish.  Can't wait to go again to try another dish."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave no stars... Got food poisoning here twice... Must've been crazy to go back for a second time since the service was shitty to begin with. But seeing how I went here on so many special occasions in previous years I was tied to the place. Not anymore. So sad to see a once good business tank. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR SERVICE."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here ! Excellent food mashallah, they offer a buffet in Ramadan with a great variety of middle eastern appetizers( humus, baba ghanuj, fattah), sambosak, soup, salad, 2 kinds of rice ,meat , chicken and fish , at least 2 stews, and two kinds of desserts( baklava is our favorite here) They do a good job, one of the best middle eastern places we ever tried we stop here every time we r in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food was very very good. The hummus is awesome. I had the chicken kabobs and they were excellent as well. Food tasted authentic.  I took one star off for service. Our waitress didn't know the menu well and was almost non existent during our meal to the point where I ran out of my drink. I will say there was a guy waiter for the table next to me and he seemed very good. Really wish I could have given this a 5 star but felt I couldn't because of the waitress."}
{"text":"Is terrible when comes to the portion of the food and the quality is strongly bad.don't waste your money. Is jokes. Nothing to do with arabic food at all....."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews, especially bad ones but this time it's a must. I really wish I could give this place a ZERO star!! We use to come here couple times a week spending at least $40 each time until recently, their service has gotten really bad. It was just us and another table, all the waiters just sat there and stare at us, finally a girl came and took our order. We ordered the chicken wings, Mozart and Gyro plate. We used to love the wings, dried rub with spices, however, this time the wings were smother in sauce. When we asked them about it, the girl said she'll get the cook to redo it. Once she brought it back to the kitchen, we can hear the cook yelling at her saying that it's the only way he can make it. She came back to tell us that there's nothing they can do. These wings looks like they came from Costco. It was disgusting!! We didn't even touch it. We can see all the waiters looking at us and talking as we were eating. It was really uncomfortable. Needless to say, this will be our last time here and we will be spending our money elsewhere. They really need to improve their customer service and the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the best Middle Eastern food I have ever eaten in Charlotte. Tonight  I went with my friend's family who have never eaten Middle Eastern food before (I am used to eat this type of food back home). My friend's family absolutely LOVED IT. The restaurant was easy to find. It was clean and the best part is that the food WAS NOT PRICEY AT ALL. Our server, Brittany, was SO GREAT in everything! The owner came to our table and talked to us. He was very nice to talk to and also generous to our table. We ordered the combination platter for appetizer and it was DELICIOUS (Yilanji, baba ghanouj, and falafel with pita bread). We had the baked chicken, Turkish Kebab, mandi lamb with rice, and lamb shawarma plate. We also had homemade chicken soup and lentil soup. We shared everything because I wanted my friend's family to try different kinds of food. They all LOVED EVERY PLATE!    If they are ever in town again, they will definitely come back. I am definitely coming back again to this wonderful restaurant.   Please keep up this excellent quality of work!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Authentic feel that is family friendly. Decent prices. Their shawarma (chicken and lamb) were nicely spiced. And their gyros are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"O.K. Finally gotten my hands [stomach] wrapped around a shawerma , it came hott and moist [had it delivered] , the flavors were wonderfully designed to make your mouth water 'while' in the act of devouring it , and I do mean devour , when I first took a glance at my new taste experience I said , \" I'll eat half now , and half later\" [due to the size of it , however , when I got to the last bite I realized \" oops, I ATE IT ALL\".  NICE!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch!  Falafel Power!!!  The best hostess this side of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"First things first, their food is amazing!!! They also have an amazing half lemonade half ice tea drink! Their daily specials are like no other, they're amazing and unique. To top it all off, they have the best customer service. The waitress was so nice always coming to check on us and always refilling my family's drinks. They made sure we enjoyed our meals and were having a good time. I recommend everyone to come to Le Kebab Grill and try them out, they're amazing!"}
{"text":"Since it opened near uncc it has been hands-down the BEST halal restaurant in town. Always had a great experience the staff is very nice. They seat you quickly as you come in and take your order fast and bring the food as fast as they can. I still have lots more dishes to try but for the price it is of good quantity and delicious food. I'm definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"We were in the area & went there for lunch based on Yelp reviews.  Very disappointed at how mediocre the food was.  Had the kebab over rice with fries and a gyro.  Would not revisit."}
{"text":"Really great!  Fresh, tasty food and a friendly proprietor.  I will definitely stop again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Was a great surprise find after spending a couple hours in IKEA. Veggie kebob and tabouli salad was amazing."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find a tasty, healthy option in a neighborhood that seemed to offer very slim pickings."}
{"text":"The food is consistently excellent!  I've only ordered take out, but the service was quick and friendly every time.  I highly recommend the chicken shawarma wrap, house salad (the house dressing is a delicious lemon vinaigrette), and hummus.  It's my go-to lunch!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 stars for ONE Reason  Give some clear options for vegans and GF customers alike :)  Insanely amazing food none the less. Stick to the classic middle eastern dishes. Hamburgers and hot dogs are for silly Americans.   Falafel wrap was to die for. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken sharwama double. It was awesome! Hard to explain the flavor because there is so much of it. Seriously, I don't normally venture out into new food styles often but this was worth it!  The steak kebabs are some of the best. Meat was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Came to eat and due to the Islamic holiday Ramadan would not serve us because they had to save tables for other parties at 830 even tho we got there at 730. Said we could sit outside in the rain"}
{"text":"If you like Mediterranean Food this place is Excellent! The staff was very friendly and did a great job! I would eat here regularly if I lived close."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely astounding. Delicious, made with love, and beautiful presented!"}
{"text":"Great food. I tried the chicken shawarma and my girlfriend had the beef kebabs. Yes, it did take longer to come out then a fast food restaurant, but for a \"made to order\" type place, I don't think it took any longer then usual. Waitress was very polite and took our order in a timely manner. Two meals, a soda, and an order of felafel came out to just over $20. Excellent food for the price and I could eat the garlic mayo with everything."}
{"text":"Traveled to the university area for business for several weeks.  Disappointed to find this area's food offering not good at all.  Le Kebab was a shining star thanks to its authentic good and attentive service, not to mention, open till late for us hard workers.  Ended up eating here a couple of times a week even though I normally only eat kabobs once a month."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little casual place that doesn't skimp on the portions!  I got the grilled chicken kebab with rice and a Greek salad. The rice was flavorful and the salad was full of feta and red onion - just how I like it! The kebab was delicious - perfectly spiced and tender.   My dinner companion had the Philly cheesesteak, which he enjoyed, and the chicken shawarma pita, which he said was not great - the pita was hard.   The baklava was very disappointing.   For my second visit, I recommended this place to a group. It took a long time for us to receive our food. But everyone thought it was delicious!   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food! I searched this restaurant on Yelp then tried it. I tried soup. It tastes good,  smells even better. The waiter, Ray was so kind that introduced the food to us. We went there after 10pm, we are sorry to keep them so late, but they were so friendly. I ordered mixed grilled kebab. That is awesome?Even the fried rice is better than other restaurant. Love it!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean restaurant has a D shape to it being situated on the end of a short plaza that makes seating peculiar but okay. Decorated nicely and had traditional eastern music playing softly. The friendly staff was smiling, warm and inviting. The food was very \"clean\", and perfectly seasoned. The veg too, very fresh. We had a bowl of yogurt dip and some pita while we we deciding on our order, also very nice. The marinated and grilled chicken was really good and the bread used for the Philly cheesesteak made it a cheesesteak to remember. You should try an experience here, it was tasty."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and all positive. For everyday meals the mixed kabab and shawarmma are amazing. For the shawarmma it's probably the best I've ever had. Seriously puts my brother's overseas to shame.   If you come on a Friday get the mansaf. Won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked in at 7:40pm. Says all tables are reserved. Says we can sit outside in the wet chairs from the rain. Won't be coming back to try it."}
{"text":"Big fan of Mediterranean food and Le Kebab never disappoints me.Tried their lemonade for the first time and I absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"I was at IKEA looking for something good close by. This place had good reviews and it was worth the short drive. Awesome authentic Mediterranean food. Really fair prices. Friendly staff that helped me choose something on the menu. Had the chicken shawerma special. Delicious."}
{"text":"The hummas was great. I would rank the lamb and chicken medium.Good authentic music. Good atmosphere for $ rating. Would not eat chicken or lamb again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! My husband and I found ourselves hungry in Charlotte and after a quick yelp search we came across this place.  It was a little hard to find (our gps took us somewhere else) and we drove around the shopping center a couple of times but just as we were about to give up we found it!   I had the lamb shawerma wrap on pita bread and fattoush salad, my husband had a similar lamb wrap.  We aren't very familiar with this type of food and we found the menu layout confusing, but left very happy.  Our server was also helpful and brought us out a little sample of their delicious hummus.   The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, and I LOVE their pita bread. It was warm and soft and perfect. And I loved the fattoush salad, so fresh and acidic.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and service. The specials are always delicious. Be sure to order the make your own appetizer combo."}
{"text":"Had the Kafta Kabab both times I've been here. Amazing both times. Great service. Try the \"flavorful\" rice."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The gyro plate and falafel are on point and surprisingly they have some AMAZING fries."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I need to satisfy a craving for Mediterranean food. However on my last visit a couple things happened that make me question whether or not I'll be returning.  1) it took an unusually long time for my order to come up.  2) A guy who came in 5 minutes after me and ordered 3xs as much got his order first while mine was just sitting on the shelf getting cold. 3) two waitresses got into a shouting match behind the counter while I was standing there wondering why I food isn't in a bag being handed to me already. those things didn't really bother me until today. 4) Today I look at my Amex statement and it seems someone there gave themselves a $3 tip on my $10 take-out. I had the lamb shawarma which is very good with the taziki and garlic sauce. But word to the wise. please zero out your tip when tipping cash or ordering takeout from this place. I found I get laxed about this at some of the places I frequent often. I will not make that mistake again."}
{"text":"This place is unreal!! The food is so authentic,  fresh and delicious, I felt as if I was back in the Mediterranean! ! The staff was very knowledgeable about the food, ingredients and how it is prepared. The staff is also so accommodating, it couldn't be better if you were at your own house!!! I will be a repeat customer for sure!!  Gary"}
{"text":"Try out the chef's special. Tried out the lamb dishes served on rice. A pure delight."}
{"text":"Really good Middle Eastern place. Didn't know if they would have run of the mill gyros and boring hummus. When we went there we were very surprised to get really tasty Middle Eastern food. We've been there twice now and everything we've tried has been good, so no need to know in advance what to try. Definitely worth stopping for every time we drive through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very picky about Middle Eastern food & I have to say I was impressed. The soups, the salads, shawarma sandwiches etc. Making it my regular spot for sure!"}
{"text":"So the food is seasoned and cooked amazingly. The meat is really tender and so far the grilled chicken is my favorite. The service is nice as well."}
{"text":"Le Kebab NEVER fails to wow us with their food and service! The buffet at Ramadan is off the chain good! Everyone must try this place - you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to find the things you love close to home!  I went for the buffet and it was great!  Everything they offered was to my liking except the hummus (how can they mess up hummus, hmmm?)  I am a Baba Ganouj girl anyway and it was right on the money.  The meat was a little on the dry side but tender and tasty.  The deserts were great so I guess it was worth the $11.99. I will be back most certainly!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up! In the area for business. Have been back several times since the \"discovery\". Tried and loved lamb shank, lamb kebabs, chicken soup. Happy and satisfied..."}
{"text":"This review is for a Gyro only. Gyro meat is frozen pre- processed and not from an authentic spit. Do not recommend the Gyro. The place is clean and staff are nice."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever , I loved the food , I loved the home made lemonade , the service is great, our server was khaldoon he has an amazing smile."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken was really good. And the kebabs are also very excellent. The rice is flavorful. The food is very fresh and seasoned nicely.    The staff are very friendly and kind. Prices are reasonable and conveniently located in the University City area.   Will definitely be back to try some other things."}
{"text":"Lentil soup was pureed, which was different than expected but very good.  I also had the mixed shawarma and steamed veggies. Loved them both. Just enough spice without being overbearing.  Now I'm getting the dessert flan to go! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. I love there biryani and kebabs. It's not a big fancy restaurant but is fair for its cost. Not much seating available. The service is a bit slow. Maybe it's just that two times. But you in for that craving you can hold on."}
{"text":"I have been here twice (on both my recent trips to Charlotte) and Le Kebab Grill is a-maz-ing!!! Authentic, fresh Middle Eastern food. Any of the lamb dishes are great. The best hummus I have ever had. This place does it right!! Great service and decent prices. The portions are big enough, that you can almost count on having leftovers for lunch the next day. I will definitely be back next time I am in town!! Can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place if you need authentic Mediterranean dishes. I am a big fan of their chicken over rice and it's worth the money as it serves two. Always try grab a plate whenever I visit university area."}
{"text":"Lamb was excellent.  Seems like there is a large take out business, but they do have wait staff."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. The hummus was good and I liked the olive oil on the dish. The pitta bread was not of the highest quality and tasted little stale. I ordered the beef kabob and was disappointed, I wish I ordered the chicken kabob instead, it was not as soft as I would hope for. On the other hand the rice (yellow basmati) was very good and nicely flavored. It was so much rice that I couldn't finish it. Over all I gave it 3 stars because the quality of the beef on the kabob."}
{"text":"Had to go back for a another visit, this time we tried the falafel appetizer. I think I enjoyed it more than my wife she has been on a mexican kick lately. Anyway, this time out my wife ordered a chicken kabob salad, it looked nice and the lemon and olive oil dressing was tangy. My addana kabob lamb was tasty, having a hint of smoked paprika. The hummus served as a side was tasty as well. On  our last visit my wife had the same dish and loved it, except she ordered rice as her side."}
{"text":"Got the lamb shawarma over hummus. It was pretty good. Meat was tasty. No complaints, the service was great, food is good but not stellar. Would come again though."}
{"text":"Best food from middle east, love the lentil soup and grilled lamb over rice. Lamb shawarma and sandwiches are great. Easy going atmosphere, hooka pipes and they do a buffet style dinner during Ramadan. Check with them on reservations during Ramadan they get really booked up quick. Bring your appetite"}
{"text":"Great place! Whenever I'm in CLT for business, I always make sure I get a meal here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food service and food itself was just fantastic. First time having a bite there with a friend of mine who I just met today. The waitress and cashier were very nice.. They helped me pick out what to order and I enjoyed it. I forgot what I orderedZz"}
{"text":"Really nice Mediterranean food !! I love their lamb shanks and knaffe. The servers are really nice and so is the owner /manager. He comes to every table to check if everything is good. The rice that they use is high quality basmati. Very tasty. Knaffe is worth dying for."}
{"text":"There are few places in Charlotte with middle eastern food and this place not only has a great selection but it's of high quality and great taste! Be sure to try the kafta or mixed grill kabobs, and the yellow rice is very well cooked and prepared! They have a nice chill dining area and outdoor seating area too.  The carry out is also prepared fast but with quality. I had a small issue once where my card was charged twice for the same meal but the manager took care of it very quickly when it was shown to him. Make sure to visit!"}
{"text":"Le Kabab Grill is great! Delicious food, friendly service, & great, convenient location. One of the best middle eastern restaurants in the area, if not the best!"}
{"text":"Nabil is really caring and a nice person who always make sure that his customers are satisfied. Despite an unpleasant first experience that  he made sure to rectify  (he was there making sure that me and my family were satisfied and the service was outstanding ) I would recommend this restaurant to you and gonna eat there again for sure"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time this afternoon and I can see why there are so many terrific reviews for this restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and the food was excellent.  Special thanks to my server Yasin.  He provided excellent service and recommend that I try the lamb shawerna wrap and it was delicious.  I look forward to eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean restaurant, the best baclava desserts, good service and delicious food"}
{"text":"The customer service is awesome, even the food is fresh. Couldn't find a better middle eastern restaurant nearby"}
{"text":"I've had their chicken shawarma (pita wrap) and baba ganoush. The shawarma is one of the best I've had anywhere. Loved it so much, I went right back the next day and got another. The baba ganoush is also excellent, and they give you a huge portion of it, definitely enough for three or four people. On top of the great food, the staff are all really friendly."}
{"text":"The food was so good.  The baba is awesome.  The chicken kabob with afghani style (Orange) was amazing.  Ask for the garlic sauce it was tasty. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way home to Winston-Salem from the airport. This was some fantastic Mediterranean food. Falafel was flavorful and and crunchy. The hummus and baba were creamy and delicious. The mixed shwarma plate had this killer garlic sauce that I could eat with everything. The service was really good. Our waitress was very attentive and nice and the restaurant looked clean and elegant. Will definitely come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place. It got really good reviews and it definitely delivered. Everything was delicious! I cleaned my plate. The kebabs has great flavor and the hummus is amazing. Try them both. I will be coming back to try the other dishes.  My only complaint was with the service. My server just didn't check in with me at all after bringing my meal. I had to flag him down to get salad dressing."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and each time the food is very flavorful. I still remember my first visit where the owner took their time to explain the menu to me, made suggestions and even offered samples of various dishes."}
{"text":"This place was decided by my wife, who is Tunisian.  We went there, expecting the usual fares, but this restaurant was phenomenal!  The staff were very courteous and inviting!  The food was great!  I had the chicken shawarma double wrap, whilst my wife had the lamb shawarma double wrap.  The food was too much, so we needed boxes.  It was very reasonably priced.  We drove three hours for this restaurant, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Passing thru Charlotte today and decided to try this place. Some of the best food I've had in a while. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of a friend. The food is great. The wait staff is attentive. My friend said Le Kebab will be added to her takeout rotation."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on accident a couple of weeks ago and went back every week ever since. They have a variety of Middle Eastern dishes that can be either ordered in a pita wrap or as an entree with rice, salad, and soup. My personal favorite is the chicken Shwarma entree with lentil soup and salad. Le Kebab Grill's atmosphere is good, although it is more a fast food rather than restaurant ambiente. The prices are pretty average for the entrees, however the wraps are very inexpensive. The garlic and hot sauce are amazing, unfortunately there is a limitation on sauces per entree. Staff and location are amazing. I really like that place!"}
{"text":"My fav eating spot in Charlotte..Have tried most of their items in the menu..you can't go wrong with anything...let it be the appetizers or their entrees along with yellow rice pilaf and garlic dips..they are the best you can get!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better middle eastern restaurant in the area.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"I love the food , Molokai is tha greatest dish , brosted chicken and lamp mandi , of course I will be back"}
{"text":"Love coming here whenever my dad flies in from California. He's super picky about his Dolma and these ones certainly pass the test!"}
{"text":"You need to try this food it's great whenever your here this is the best place for middle eastern food"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and fresh as I would make in my own home-if I could make it as tasty!!! We stopped here after a long day driving with only fast food places to choose from. This was a Welcome hot meal!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean places in the Charlotte area. Mostly get take out from here. The prices are reasonable and the food always taste great."}
{"text":"Came into town yesterday and thought we would try this out. Very pleased with our food and the staff. The owner even gave my husband something else to try . Daughter and son loved it also. We will be back. Ty"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight and we'll be back!  We don't eat meat, but did a wide-ranging sample of the vegetarian offerings - best I've had in Charlotte since we lost the Middle East Deli on Independence.   We started with stuffed grape leaves and Ful Madammas, which I'd never had before.  Both were excellent, as were the lentil soup, hummus, baba ghanouj, and tabouleh ... fantastic.  I restrained myself because I'm crazy for a good falafel wrap, and I got it here. Perfect balance of ingredients and flavors, exactly the right amount of tahini.  For you omnivores, others in our group had meat kebabs and shawarma and said they were fantastic.    Our evening here was a great experience and I recommend to others in search of quality middle-eastern food.  Our servers, Arij and Wayne, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, and all the staff seem to value every guest. We don't live near the university and, esp with light rail construction, were concerned about traffic and parking, but both were surprisingly easy, at dinnertime on a weekday!  The portions are truly generous, as others have mentioned. It would be impossible to leave here hungry, and you'll enjoy the experience, and every single bite!"}
{"text":"Glad to see this place is thriving!!  I used to come here for hookah and baklava back in my undergrad days. This opened in the old Yoshi's Grill location by Jimmy Johns in the University area. It's my favorite Mediterranean place in the area."}
{"text":"Was working in the area and decided to come to Le Kebab for a late lunch. Read some other reviews and decided to try the mixed shawarma with lamb and chicken over hummus. The dish was delicious! Hummus didn't have a ton of flavor but he lamb and chicken had plenty to make up for it. Add some of their hot sauce and its a wonderful meal!  Pita bread was just ok, only reason I wouldn't give it 5. Will return again.  I see a lot of complaints on here about time to get food, I ordered to go around 2pm and it took 7-8 minutes to come out so not bad at all."}
{"text":"Wow this place really knows how to make and serve Lebanese / Arabic food  I'm originally from Jordan and really outside of Detroit I have not found any restaurant worth visiting twice for authentic Arabic cuisine  I am so impressed by the food I am going to recommend this to everyone  If u want to know what a falafel wrap is supposed to taste like try it here I will try to update the review as I try more things of the menu Hammous and chicken Shawerma excellent and authentic  This place is by far best Lebanese in Charlotte"}
{"text":"My third visit the food is tasty , try the chicken shawerma double with garlic sauce . Open late and the staff is always nice . On my last visit i ordered the grilled chicken with yellow rice which was delicious and was a huge portion . I felt like I needed to write a review because of how good the food is. The service all the time good  Friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few weeks ago right after they opened up.  As others have said there might have been a few hiccups in terms of speed, but it was worth the wait. Having lived overseas in the Middle East multiple times, I can say that without a doubt it's as close to authentic as I've found here in the QC.  Nabil (I think?) the owner, is really eager to please and want's people to try out everything he's got.  He might be a little over the top, but I'd rather see a little passion go too far then the converse.    The hummus was fresh and a huge portion, the pita came in little plastic bags which seemed odd, but tasted great and didn't really bother me, just made the presentation a little weak, but again it was it's first few weeks.  I had the shwarma, which was clean, fresh tasting and well assembled.  And the key, it had fries in it! I can tell you that in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, etc they almost always had fries in them so that's the way that I love them. Anyway, it was filling and made me think of my days back east.  All in all a great find on the north side of town that I'll frequent again as soon as I can,"}
{"text":"Don't use apple maps to get there or you will get lost. Great food. The server was very nice. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great find! Outstanding falafels. Chicken and lamb shawarmas were excellent. Top notch service. Such a great lunch we got dinner to go!!"}
{"text":"The server was really friendly and the food was really good.  We shared the falafels, grape leaves, baba ghanoush, tabouleh salad, hummus, and greek salad.  The falafels were so good and the grape leaves were my favorite.  I would definitely go back and recommend to those looking for a healthy/vegetarian option in the University area."}
{"text":"FRESH AND TASTY FOOD.  Good customer service.  The rice a little to season for my taste.  The beef kabob too dry other than that everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I went back today with a friend, and to be honest, there were several issues that probably made this the last time I'll visit. (Spoiler alert: some of these complaints are very petty, but I wanted to explain why I won't be coming back.)  The server was very friendly, but for the most part was barely around. He sat us, yet seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to come back and actually take our orders, even though it wasn't very busy.  Both me and my friend ordered water with lemon, and the lemon provided was a paper-thin slice. I don't drink water because I'm cheap, I drink it because I'm avoiding all sweetened drinks, and lemon makes it taste more bearable. The slice was so thin, I could barely squeeze it, let alone taste it.  The owner has bought new tables (they're beautiful, by the way), and he was putting them together outside. As a result, however, he and the rest of the staff kept opening the outside doors and even worse, standing in the doorway for minutes on end while cold air blew directly on us.  When I got my chicken kebabs (which have ranged from very good to heavenly in previous visits) this time, they were bizarrely garnished with a couple slices of overly grilled onion, a wilted half of a hot pepper, and a charred grape tomato. It looked very unappetizing. It's never been \"garnished\" before. I get two servings of rice as my two sides, and there was noticeably less on my plate this time (I like to eat one skewer with half the rice for lunch, then take the rest home and reheat it for dinner).  But what made me decide I wouldn't be back was the seasoning. Every other time I've had this dish, it's been liberally coated in oregano, one of my all-time favorite herbs. This time there was no visible herbs at all in the rice, and the chicken skewers were lightly dusted with parsley (including stems along with the leaves).  The chicken was still very moist, grilled wonderfully, and had a very good flavor. I would not consider giving this meal or my experience at the restaurant less than three stars, although I will point out that when we were finished eating, we had to ask one of the owners for carry-out containers, and we asked the cashier if we could go ahead and check out because the waiter never brought us our check.  This wasn't even remotely the worst experience I've had in a restaurant. But every other visit (maybe 6-7 total?) has been great. This time it was barely adequate.  And as ridiculous as it sounds, I don't want to try it again and end up getting the chicken skewers with those weird, depressing garnishes again. As much as the total lack of oregano bothered me, those unappetizing garnishes were what really put me off the entire place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Le Kebab and it was amazing! The food was full of flavor and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is on point! Really good food, gets busy so service takes a little bit but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Variety of options for the main and sides. The pilaf rice is good. Service is also good"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch! Only been twice now but the food has been full of flavor and the service has been great!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we decided to eat lunch here rather than just find the best BBQ place in the area as we often do when traveling. Our kids would've preferred chick fil a, but Mommy and Daddy usually eat for them.   We started with the 3 combo platter: falafel, hummus, and yalanji. All were excellent, my favorite being the yalanji (stuffed grape leaves). For my main meal, I ordered the gyro plate entree. Portion was large, rice and lamb absolutely delicious, pita bread perfect. Husband ate the grilled chicken over rice with tzatziki; I kept sneaking bites. Boys were happy enough with nuggets and fries. Good service."}
{"text":"Quality of food is good and service is very good. Definitely worth a visit. Had chicken shawarma, but I have had better tasting one elsewhere. I wish they had sweet potato fries on the menu instead of regular fries."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. The staff was very friendly, my food did not take long at all to get to me, and it had so much flavor. I had the falafel wrap and it was super tasty and prepared wonderfully! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a lucky find for us! Khadlon was so friendly and patient with we newbies. He even gave us some falafel to try for free! Pleasant atmosphere, great food and decent prices. I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"This place was very small.  Not the place I would go on a fancy date, but definitely had good food.  The service was kind of slow, but it was a busy time in the evening so I can expect a bit of a delay.  I will probably come again when I'm in the mood for a good schawarma."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern food.  Always consistent.  Good service.  Great prices.  Authentic experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! The food was incredibly flavorful and delicious. The staff was helpful with suggestions and offered samples before I picked my entree. Service was fast as well. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good prices with prompt &knowledgeable service. Lamb needed a tad bit of seasoning;however, the shrimp kebab was charred and seasoned well.  The falafel was priced right and tasted great. Wish they would invest in one of those entrance fans because the flies were a little distracting. Will definitely  come back in the near future."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's so authentic! Best middle eastern food in Charlotte. The service is also impeccable and I frequent it often."}
{"text":"I've been to a few  Mediterranean, Lebanese restaurants and this place is the best so far they are fresh the Falafel, Baba ganoush, the Tabouleh salad, Kafta are delish and tasty. Servers are quick and friendly. We will go back definitely."}
{"text":"I had lamb kebabs with yellow rice and a salad. The kebabs were well seasoned but overcooked and very dry. The rice was very good, but it's hard to mess up rice. The salad was pretty bad, it wasn't even a salad just some diced tomatoes and chopped lettuce with a bland dressing."}
{"text":"I definitely suggest u try this place, by far the best quality, portion and prices around the area."}
{"text":"Great food, extraordinary service. First time here and definitely coming back!  Chicken schwarma is delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been going there for close to four years! I lived in Germany for several years and it reminds me of the middle eastern food I could get there.   I frequent the place one to two times a month. I love that it is a locally owned place with great food and prices whether it is dine in or carry out. If you are looking for a hidden gem, I definitely recommend this place. The food consistent along with great prices. I love to know that every time I go there, I am going to a great meal. It is hands down easily one of my favorite restaurants.   I would it if there was location on the south side of Charlotte! I live in the area of this restaurant but I work in south Charlotte. There are days I would love to have it for lunch but since it is so far away, I cannot. I definitely have not been impressed with other middle eastern places that are close to my work as I have been with this place.   One thing I would note is for dinner time during Ramadan you should consider carry out if you pressed for time. Since they prepare for a feast at sundown, the dine in service time is not as good as it is during any other time you would go there. My kids can get impatient having to wait longer than usual, so we just do carry out to avoid that during that time of the year."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and food was great! I'm from out of town and the GPS took me to the wrong place. I called and received very detailed directions."}
{"text":"I ordered a mint tea which was amazing, a lentil soup which was comforting (though needed more flavoring but I really loved the pita chips it came with), and a kofta sandwich  (I liked it better without the pita bread). The service was very good - they checked on us often. I felt very good about going there."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is just ok. I order take out and they're never on time and it's hard to get someone to talk to you."}
{"text":"So yummy.  I had the appetizer sampler with grape leaves, hummus, and falafel.  My husband had a philly cheesesteak.  We were both very pleased with our meals, and the staff were all extremely kind and attentive!  We also thought it was very cool that they have materials to teach people about the religion of Islam.  We enjoyed reading the pamphlets and learning some things we didn't know."}
{"text":"So good even the water gets 5 stars!  Went here this weekend with some family - specifically because it was nearby some stores we were at, but also because they had vegan options.  It was refreshing to have the staff well versed on allergies and ingredients in their food and made it tremendously easy to find options for everyone.  I had the lentil soup and falafel wrap with a shareable plate of hummus for my relatives.  The lentil soup was perfect for a cold day and had a creamy texture (lentils, carrots, potatoes blended).  The table hot sauce and some pepper took this to another level.  The hummus was prototype smooth goodness and the pita actually came out warm (some places get lazy, but not Le Kebab Grill!)  We had them bring out some other hot sauce that we all could pretty much drink because it was delicious (more on this in a few lines).  The falafel wrap was out of this world.  The actual falafel were super crispy on the outside with warm, perfectly seasoned insides.  It had some lettuce, tomato and more hummus with tahini sauce  on the inside which made it quite filling.  This was one of those scenarios where we were so full off the generous servings, but our mouths were so hypnotized that we could have easily forced some more food down our bellies.    Back to the hot sauces - we ended up asking one of our servers if they sold the sauce and what was in it.  We were told they actually bought the sauce and when we asked what kind it was- they went back and snapped a pic of the bottles - awesome service!  Ironically these were both common sauces easily found in stores but perhaps the spell-casting capabilities of Le Kebab Grill can make anything taste 10x better - even the water!  Will definitely be going back here - something for everyone."}
{"text":"Hooray, there is finally tasty affordable falafel in University City. And don't worry that lean pricing means lean portions. My wrap was chock full of chickpea, sesame and pickled goodness all for $4 + tax. The flavor is good enough to convince me I don't need to drive all the way down to Sharon Amity every time I have a Mediterranean craving.   Where Le Kebab Grill does slack a little is the service. The gentleman in charge is awesome and attentive, but his counter help isn't always on the ball (or at the counter) and they forgot to add the hot sauce I ordered to my wrap (which I might not have minded if it weren't $.59 extra). Maybe over time they will get with the program or maybe its just a case of college-help-itis. Le Kebab Grill is a welcome addition to the Grand Promenade Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Appetizers are so fresh, very homey, and authentic with a very modern layout . Love the soup."}
{"text":"So last night I headed out to Le Kabab for the annual iftar buffet that the have during the fasting. I have frequented this restaurant for years, so I was really looking forward to it. Typically, the food is decent and consistent. I have been to several middle eastern countries and eaten a wide variety of dishes that come from the region, so I am quite familiar. For the most part, Le Kabab is pretty average. Compared to other Middle East restaurants in town, they are one of the better ones. However, last night the food and service was terrible. From being discouraged from dining in because the place was crowded, to the waitress that didn't check on me, bring me water and flat out refused to clean the dirty table. When I was being seated I sat my bag down to go to the buffet and and asked \"can you clean the table, it still looks dirty?\" She mumbled something which at the time didn't matter to me as I was very hungry and who isn't going to honor your request at a restaurant and NOT clean a table that was CLEARLY DIRTY. Once I returned to the table, I was so shocked to see that she never cleaned it. So I waited for her to come back. I wasn't going to be rude but I was flaming mad. At that point, another waiter comes and as me what I wanted to drink. When he came back with water, I just cleaned the table myself and decided to get over eat and just enjoy the food. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Bland pieces of fatty lamb, chicken kabobs that could have cooked longer, and more unfavorable side dishes. Buffet food should be quickly replenished and not left until empty. I recently found another Arabic restaurant in town and that will be my go to spot in the future. Best wishes to the establishment but I am moving on from here."}
{"text":"My wife and I love eating here! This is hands down our favorite restaurant. From vegan to full on carnivore and everything in between. Usually people say what food they like at a place. But here everything we have eaten has been stellar. High quality, well made, affordable and great service. This place is just over an hour from where we live and we make the drive past hundreds of other restaurants. Maybe you won't feel the same passion for the place, but you will have a great meal."}
{"text":"Good food !!! Their chicken shawarma is one of the best I've tried, hummus is also very flavorful, a must restaurant to try in north Charlotte !!"}
{"text":"Best service ever. It was my first time and they offered me a plate of hummus, babaganoush, shawarma of beef and lamb to taste with pita before putting an order. Everyone has a great smile. Make you feel welcomed. Food is fabulous and very tasty. Ambiance is outstanding. This restaurant is a must !!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! The staff is always friendly, great servers and the food is excellent! Best rice. So far I have tried the mixed vegetable kebabs, Gyro, Lamb burger, several appetizers and Grilled Chicken. All of it was perfect. The three combo appetizer is a great deal and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. Def try them out."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Can get busy at times, which can cause to wait a while to get your food. Staff are mostly friendly. Have noticed a downturn in service this year compared to when I used to go a lot two years ago"}
{"text":"This was probably some of the best food I have eaten in a long time. The service was awesome. The hummus was some of the best I have ever eaten. The friendly staff was very helpful in navigating the menu. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Absolutely phenomenal restaurant!!!!!!! The previous reviews are the reason I went here, and boy were they spot on. Our waitress was Jamie and she was awesome! So personable, welcoming, funny, charismatic and she gave us a run for our money with jokes and puns. I ordered a spinach pie for an appetizer, a gyro and chicken kebab which came with fries and a salad for my entrée (I was really hungry), and to finish it off with dessert, baklava and rice pudding. Everything was incredible. I am Greek so I am very picky about my Greek food. I was fully expecting to not like it much. I have been spoiled by authentic Greek food while visiting family in Athens, Greece. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the spinach pie. It did not have any cheese in it and the spinach they use has a slight bitter taste to it. Other than that, everything tasted very comparable to the real thing. I have visited Athens, Greece many times and no restaurant here can beat it, but this place is a very close second to the real thing. I recently went to a Greek/Italian restaurant in south Charlotte that was okay. Much more expensive than this place. The food at Le Kebab Grill knocked the food at the other place out of the park and came in at about a third of the cost. I will definitely be going back. Best middle eastern/Mediterranean food I've had since Athens, Greece!!!!!! I can't say it enough. BEST MIDDLE EASTERN AND MEDITERRANEAN FOOD YOU WILL HAVE IN CHARLOTTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, however I am only giving it 3 stars because I am obsessed with hummus and I found it flavorless and watery.  Will definitely try it again and hopefully I can update my review!"}
{"text":"Super authentic and super delicious. The tabouleh salad is on point, be sure to ask for the lemon dressing.  They went back to real lemon juice instead of that artificial crap.  Great atmosphere and very laid back.  If you enjoy middle eastern food this will be your favorite place in charlotte."}
{"text":"It was ok. The hummus, tabouli and service was great! The portions are large.     My hubby and I ordered the mixed shawarma. It wasn't very flavorful and the lamb/beef was dry."}
{"text":"Horrible food and no idea how to cook at all it is a sad place to eat . Went there with my brother in law and family on my trip to Charlotte NC . The food was a total disappointment, these guys can't cook if their life depended upon it . I am sure there much better places to eat in the area.   The lentil soup was made with puréed potato's , the lamb had a musky smell to it. Chicken was baked before grilling , hummus was out of this world bland , and the table service was the least a person can hope for .   Will not visit again"}
{"text":"I hate to do it. I hate to be the outsider because I see all these 4 and 5 star reviews, but yea man I've had better. The chicken in my wrap was dry and the garlic mayo really overpowers any other flavor that may have existed in my wrap. I'd much rather have something light like Tzatziki. Now I did get some on the side and for some reason the consistency was like mayo whereas someone at my table had the same but the consistency of hers was creamy salad dressing like. I don't know... maybe mine was thawed out recently. Anyway, I wanted to make sure we had the same thing. When I tasted hers, it was very tart and just unpleasant; and mine was just okay.   The fries were meh. Again, I'm a fry connoisseur and these just weren't hittin it.   The falafel was off today I guess cause I make better ones at home. I'm not trying to be harsh but there wasn't any freshness to it. I thought maybe some Tzatziki would help, but nah. I had 6 balls. Took a bite of one and didn't have anymore. I should have asked them to take if off my bill.   Now the service was top notch. I was with a big group and the waiter was extremely attentive and kind. I feel like we were all trying to do something different with our food and he wasn't impatient are annoyed but really helpful. He offered some good suggestions for others and he was accommodating for us all.   Someone I was with commented that she wasn't feeling the place either and recommended another Mediterranean joint to me. Maybe it was an off day? I don't know.   I can't say I'll be back but I'm grateful for the attempt."}
{"text":"When I walked in, the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  This was around 4:00pm on a Saturday. I went to the counter to place my to go order.  Two workers were standing behind the counter just talking not acknowledging that I was waiting to be helped.  A waitress then came from the back of the restaurant and asked if I wanted to eat in or take out. I told her take out.  The waitress interrupted the two girls behind the counter talking and told them I wanted to place a to go order.  The young caucasian girl then came to me and said, \"What do you want?\"  in a very nasty tone. I should have just walked out at that point.  Instead, I ordered the baked chicken over rice with grilled veggies.  The chicken and rice tasted as if they were made last Monday and the veggies were cold and soggy!  This place is HORRIBLE!  Needless to say I WILL NOT RETURN!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Amazing food and I can say worth every penny you spend.  The food is very cheap and best food for the price you pay   Strongly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We're from Raleigh and stopped here for lunch after reading other reviews. This food is magnificent; (My father is a chief, so we as his kin are thus naturally food snobs.) Definitely come by!! This food leaves you feeling full but not stuffed like you ate a brick, and most importantly good food with great flavors and healthy too. Nothing is greasy, their grapelaves are divine and the falafel is hot crunchy and wonderful! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Visited today with a colleague and was treated to a great lunch.  We chose the sampler appetizer (liked the warm grape leaves), lamb shank and triple kabob entrees.  All were delivered promptly and piping hot--they also tasted very well, too.  Our server was friendly, quick and efficient.  Good local find with some nice selections.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I will always recommend this place. Authentic middle eastern food, affordable prices, and comfortable setting. The menu is diverse and I've not gotten a bad meal yet. I recommend the Lamb Mandi, one of the specials. It comes with yellow rice, cucumber sauce, and a spicy pepper sauce (all of which are lovely). Their appetizers are delicious. This is a great place to try out food you haven't had before. They have Greek, Turkish, Halal, veggie, you name it!  During the warmer months, they also offer hookah outdoors. The staff sets it up for you. You get a large, somewhat nondescript hookah with a few coals on tin foil. I believe wind screens are available if necessary. I'm not judging the restaurant for the quality of the shisha they use, but I will say that it has been hit or miss. I would say to steer clear of the pomegranate flavor. It is dull and tasteless. Other than that, the staff is helpful and will get you extra coals if you need them."}
{"text":"In a word: DELICIOUS! Went based on a tip from a business colleague and was not disappointed.. authentic Middle Eastern cuisine made from scratch. It's all in the flavor..The Baba ghanoush like I never had in the States. FUL MEDAMES (STEWED FAVA BEANS) the most flavorful dish I've had.KAFTA (LEBANESE BEEF KEBABS) Mmmm, Hummus - forget Sabra this is the real deal. Stuffed Cronish Game Hens. Lamb that made me want to go Halal for all meat. Great prices. Great service. Anytime I'm in the area I will go.And, last but not least great service."}
{"text":"It appears major retail may be vacating the central University City area over to Northlake and Concord Mills. Even more will be splitting when the new shopping center opens near Ikea. A plus to this appears to be lower rents and more ethic type restaurants. Great for me; probably bad for real estate investors. Le Kebab Grill is a fine Middle Eastern option; worth checking out for some variety and adventurous cuisine.  The restaurant set up is simple; light colored walls with modern art and large windows streaming sunlight. Service has been friendly, prompt and helpful. Falafel is dense, hot and delicious with the tahini sauce; the eight piece serving split between two people will go fast. The stuffed grape leaves are tasty as well; slick with olive oil and shaped like cigars.  The Kafta Kabobs consists of seasoned ground beef pressed around a skewer and redolent of cumin with perhaps a touch of cinnamon; order it all the time it's so yummy. You can get your main with a salad simply dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. Some days the dressing is better than others; perfect with the right amount of lemon juice but on occasion it seems to come out of a particularly harsh bottle of True Lemon. The rice they serve is tasty and generously portioned. The last time I was there they offered a smoked rice and it was so good; yellow rice with a subtle smoked flavor.  Good food, nice portions and great prices; I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, friendly staff offered me a sample of the kofta special/stew before I ordered. I fell in love and ordered it! So flavorful! The meat is perfect. Yummy hummus, dolmas, and falafel. Very kind, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance.  It's warm and cozy. The food was amazing. It was worth the wait. The service was nice and the servers were nice. I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints. Always good and consistent. Have been there multiple times and always come back a happy tummy. The price does not put a hole in the pocket. Sometimes the waiters tend to be a bit rude, so its not a 5 from me."}
{"text":"Ms. Addison is phenomenal. I stopped in just to look at the menu and her customer service blew me away. Thanks and I will be back just BC of her.. Love the Jersey girl in her..."}
{"text":"\"meh\" about sums up this place. i had high hopes based on previous reviews but was overall disappointed. we are on a quest to find the best gyros in charlotte. however, the gyros were small. it's a little confusing as to whether you order at the counter or sit down and order. the owner was taking our or order and interrupted to take a phone order before getting back to us. when we asked for a beverage cup, he said \"we serve you\" and then took the cup over to the machine and set it down (we were sitting at a table). the waitress, when she brought our food, didn't say anything just dumped it on the table and shuffled away. boyfriend says it was an overall weird experience.   the gyros didn't have much flavor but the tzatziki was good.   overall, the gyros at little village grill in uptown are the front runner! (for now... but the quest continues)"}
{"text":"My 3 stars review is mostly based on the food.  My husband and I decided to grab dinner before going to the movies and looking on Yelp this place came out with good reviews and one dollar sign for the price.  We got sat right away and the waitress was very attentive.  They have some decent options but definitely were not just one dollar sign place.  The place was clean and didn't take too long for the food to come but I was impressed with the food at all. Specially because my meal, for my standards, was not a big of a deal. I had a gyro plate and my husband had a phillycheese steak. My husband enjoyed his food a lot but unfortunately I can't say the same about mine.  I had a salad as side with lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers. The tomatoes were old, they were white looking and really soft.  My steamed veggies looked like the ones you get frozen from de grocery store and the tatziki sauce was the worst I've ever had in my life. The only thing good was the meat and the pita bread. It cost me $15 for a meal that I could eat 1/3.  Unfortunately this is some place I won' go back."}
{"text":"Just the smell of grilled meat alone will pull you into Le Kebab Grill.  My coworker and I walked in on a Friday night and found the place crowded, but still with plenty of tables to accommodate the many parties that were waiting to be seated. Our waitress for the night was Ketty who has to be one of the nicest waitresses we have ever met. She was so meticulous when it came to explaining the menu, especially when we had some questions about the items. She came by often to check on us, always polite and always asking us if we needed anything. At one point, my coworker had a question about what vegetable his soup was made out of and she quickly went into the kitchen to ask the chef before coming out and explaining to us what it was. Just Ketty's service alone deserves five stars.  But I'm happy to report that the food at Le Kebab Grill is worth boasting about as well. Before we had even got a chance to order food, Ketty brought out a complimentary platter of two falafels, hummus, pita bread, and house chips. There was so much food! Even though there was plenty to have as a starter, my coworker and I also got the combination platter with falafels (so good we had to order more), labaneh (a yogurt cheese to eat with pita bread), and stuffed grape leaves. The yalanji was super light to have and definitely helped us meet our daily vegetables serving for the day. The labaneh complimented the hummus well, especially with the soft pita bread.  Even though I was already quite full, I still ordered the gyro plate that consisted of thinly sliced and grilled lamb and beef with a side of tzatziki sauce as well as a side of lentil soup. The lamb and beef were combined into lightly grilled slices of meat that reminded me a lot of bacon without all the fat. I loved eating it with the pita bread and the tzatziki sauce that added a touch of tang and creaminess.   As for the soup, I've never had lentil soup before so I didn't really know what to expect. I wasn't too fond of the puree-like texture and there was a slight bitter aftertaste. However, I could definitely taste the fresh ingredients and the soup was delightfully light.  Good food and phenomenal service from Ketty easily made Le Kebab Grill one of the most memorable spots for dinner for my stay here in North Carolina. The food was flavorful, the portions were gigantic, and the service was absolutely welcoming.   Let's go back!"}
{"text":"First time here....always looking for good places before my French language classes up in the University Area. And it won't be my last time!  Started with the Falaffel balls, with a delicious Tahini sauce. Very tasty and well seasoned. Due to the Yelp reviews, I tried the Lamb Shawarma which came with 2 sides, so I opted for their very delicious Lentil Soup (everyone who reviewed this was indeed correct - YUMMY) and the yellow basmati rice. The lamb didn't have any \"funk\" in it that it CAN have (at less than reputable establishments) and it was very delicious. A little \"odd\" in that they were small strips and not \"Greek Gyro-like\" in thicker strips....but boy do they give you a LOT of it. My only criticism is that the tahini sauce, which was the same they served with the Falaffel, didn't seem to go with the Lamb. A yogurt based sauce (like Tzatziki) would go better with the Lamb. But the lamb itself was delicious by itself.  And just because I'm a Hummus Junkie, I had to leave with a side of their Hummus. I had it for breakfast the next day and it was very good! I'd personally like a tad more garlic in it but hey, it was very creamy and delicious.  Oh, the staff and my server were all SUPER nice and friendly, and made sure my experience was a great one. It was. And when she found out it was my first time there, she threw in a Baklava for free. And it was very yummy as well!  Overall a really great place for Simple but DELICIOUS Mediterranean food. Definitely a place to check out! For those of you on the South Side of Charlotte (like me), check out Jasmine Grill on South Blvd, which is just as good if not better than Le Kebob!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and this place popped up as one of the top Mediterranean spots in town, so I rushed over knowing how much I loved lamb over rice and shwarmas. My experience was not as good as I was hoping, but it wasn't necessarily bad either.   Service:  Service was good, but understaffed as it was extremely busy. The servers are extremely nice and have great knowledge of the menu. They'll make a custom order with just about anything without really breaking a sweat.  Food: Here's where I got some disappointments. I ordered the lamb over rice with a lentil soup * Falafels. The falafels were pretty good, the soup not so much, with the lamb being fairly dry. I got some garlic sauce on the side which really brought out the flavor of the lamb over rice. However, if I didn't order it regularly from other Mediterranean places, I would've been really disappointed with me meal.  Venue: Very nice venue that seats a surprisingly large amount of people (even if it does look small). Extremely clean with plenty of room, has a very charlotte-esque feel.  Overall, I believe this place is extremely overhyped, maybe because there's a lack of good Mediterranean food around the area. Overall, I might come back but only to try a sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place! I judge a Middle Eastern place by how good their kofta is and I love it. Very well spiced. They have many options for sides plus all the delicious appetizers you can want (baba ganouj, hummus, stuffed grape leaves and many more). Service is top notch, reasonable prices and very non-assuming atmosphere, which is perfect for me."}
{"text":"I saw this place while picking up from Jimmy John's the other day and I was excited for some nearby Mediterranean food.  My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch and ordered the appetizer combination tray with stuffed grape leaves, baba gnoush, and hummus. I wasn't crazy about the hummus, but the grape leaves and baba gnoush were excellent! We also ordered falafel sandwiches. The falafel itself was excellent and the best I've tried in Charlotte; my only criticism is that I wish the wrap had more pickle. The bread and pita that accompanied our starters was fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back! It was quick and very affordable, the staff was also quite friendly.  Update: June 2012- Since my initial review, I've been back three times. I've discovered that their mint yogurt dip appetizer is delicious as well as their lentil soup (which I'm told is completely vegetarian- no chicken broth)! I've been pretty unoriginal and ordered falafel or lentil soup and an appetizer each visit; I still need to try their baklava. I believe the owner has greeted us each time we dined and asked how our meals were and the staff are very outgoing."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying after reading all the wonderful reviews and seeing the menu I was very excited for my meal. I was in town for only two days and only wanted to try local eats. (No chains). Unfortunately I never got to try the food.  After the waiter took our order (very good service ) which was good to say. The table next to us had a ceiling tile fall straight in the middle of the table hitting a women in the head and broke into hundred pieces. What looked to me as if the ceiling tile that was saturated by the water sweat from the A/C vent had given way and came crashing down on top of this innocent women. What also came down were \"PALMETTO BUGS aka ROACHES\". Which scattered the floor and all over the table and floor. At that point the managers were running around to try to step on them and contain the situation. These bugs were BIG!  We took our belongings and were walking out when the waiter offered us to move our table. Let's just put it this way I quickly lost my appetite."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Amazing ethnic food in the university area!  Hummus (spelled hommos on their menu - WHO KNEW?) is the freshest I've ever had.   I've only had take out for lunch but I have heard their baklava is well worth the splurge. Tucked into a shopping center Le Kebab is working seeking out for a no frills lunch or dinner. Maybe not the best place to take a first date to impress them...."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The lentil soup with lemon is outstanding and the shawarma is delicious!  On top of that the owner is awesome. Friendly and cares about what he does. Food is all made in house and only use best ingredients. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Stopped here during a weekend in Charlotte. Clean restaurant with a variety of Middle Eastern foods. Vegan dishes available. I ordered the kafta kabob. Lots of rice and 2 skewers (meat was easy to get off skewer). Could make 2 meals out of one. Well-seasoned. Ordered hummus as an appetizer. Nice and creamy and good serving size. Servers were attentive. Great location near shopping."}
{"text":"I have never had mediterranean food before and i let our server know. He was very informative and helped us choose a dish he thought we would enjoy! He even brought out a sample dish of falafel, pita bread with homemade hummus, and lamb and chicken (on the house!!!). The food was incredible and I loved the seasoning!"}
{"text":"Lamb shawarma wrap with garlic sauce and fries with hot sauce.  It does not get better than this.   The mango drink they keep in the cooler is the most refreshing drink I have ever had. It paired so well with all of the foods here!   I came with a very big group so I was able to try a lot of the foods here in addition to the Lamb Shawarma wrap:   lentil soup - really good hummus with pita - also really good! We took it up a notch and added some hot sauce; delish.  Chicken Shawarma - double plate - the chicken is insanely good.  Falafel wrap - really really good - dont forget the Tzatziki! Chicken Kebab and Rice - chicken and rice is already the best invention ever so don't leave without trying it from here - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very authentic mediterranean food. Falafel was outstanding. Gyro sandwiches are very good too and big. Make sure you request the hot sauce that's not on the table made with sweet red peppers and something else that's both sweet and spicy - not real hot but very, very, very tasty."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during a business trip to Charlotte. I always try to support Muslim businesses so I stopped by here after seeing the reviews on Yelp. Service was very friendly. I ordered the lentil soup, which was solid. Ordered the chicken shwarma wraps and they were very good. Tender chicken, and lots of it. Fries were decent. Everything cost like $13.00. I'm not sure what the halal scene in Charlotte is, especially the University City area, but I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! That is all....I love tasting food from other cultures and I have just at started eating Mediterranean cuisine. This place is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I got lamb and only lamb.  Plenty of meat and plenty of rice.  Really enjoyed the spicy sauce.  Could use more spicy sauce.  Friend came with but they don't eat dairy, including butter.  That only left about three appetizers as possible food options.  Not a good stop for the dairy free crowd.  You can't get items sans dairy, they can't prep special for you.  You eat hummus or olive paste or not at all."}
{"text":"Went 2 nights in a row with my husband, very good and authentic middle eastern food.  On our first visit we had mozhat and molokhia. They were excellent.  So much so that we came by the next night to split the mixed grill kebab platter with a side of hummus.  This restaurant will definitely stay on my list of favs!"}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH! Just like the old country! My grandmother would be impressed! I've had a lot of bad experiences at other Mediterranean restaurants but once we worked up the courage to try this place we fell in love. We've been back at least once a week since."}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible overpriced food.  Went to the ramadan buffet tonight.  There wasn't a single dish cooked properly, extremely dry chicken, chewy tough beef, fried items were cold and soggy.  Sterno was out on all of the dishes so it was all cold.  None of the buffet items that were out were getting replenished, and there were several.  They told us the buffet goes until 10:30 and we got there at 9:50 so there was no excuse for empty buffet items, especially when the kitchen was still open which it clearly was because they were still taking orders from other tables and food was coming out of the window.  Service was non existent, every server was sitting around, you had to go up to them and interrupt their conversation to ask for a glass of water.  All for 15 bucks...this place is garbage, will never go back."}
{"text":"Shawarma!  This is a GOOD one!  Delicious Lamb!!!  Better than most places! Great Pita!  Nice Tahini Sauce, flavor milder than most.  Fatoush and Tabouleh are the Salads I want in a place like this and both are good here!  Lentil Soup - mild, thick and hearty!  Hot Mint Tea reminded me of Moroccan Tea from down the street (I have never been to Morocco).  We did not check out the Turkish Coffee here and they do have it!  Basher did a great job greeting us as we walked in, serving us and answering questions!      He also told us how we could create the smaller meal we wanted since this was an after Dinner snack/meal (second Dinner).  He asked us if we wanted  Hookah...  This place is very comfortable!  I did not mind being the only White person here... My girlfriend is Turkish so she fit right in and I guess I did too."}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place while grabbing food from another restaurant near by. So one night I decided to try them out. I called ahead and when I left work and arrived my food was ready. The staff was nice and made want to come back and eat in. The food was pretty good. I will order from them again."}
{"text":"I have been to Le Kebab maybe 20 times over the last few years, and the food has always been consistently excellent.  While I haven't had everything on the menu, I've had many of them, including the pita wraps, hummus, baba ganoush, yolandji, chicken shawarma, tabouleh, and felafel (the felafel is arguably the best in the city-try it!).  Each item is prepared with fresh ingredients, has delicious flavors, and the staff is always friendly and eager to answer any questions about the menu.  I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant (although service can sometimes understandably get a little slow during peak rushes), and it is nice to see people of all different backgrounds coming together here to enjoy the authentic flavors of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOOVE Le Kebab! Back when I used to live in the university city area, most of my paycheck either went to rent or here. My roommates and I used to go so often that several of the staff that used to work there would know our order just by seeing our faces. Now that I live quite a bit out I don't get to eat here as much as I wish I could but I still hype this place up to anyone out of town. The staff are always really nice. The only downside is that it's kinda pricey. The portion size is pretty good before the price increase. If you've had halal cart, the portion size of this is twice as big but also 3x the price. I've always ordered the lamb mandi or lamb shank, both are ridonkulously delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby tried this out today, we had the appetizer sampler with baba gnoush, falafel and labaneh. First off the falafel was delicious and piping hot, the labaneh wast tangy thick and cool the baba gnoush had an odd aftertaste neither of us cared for. The pitas did come in little ziplocs which was not an issue but the strong refrigerator taste on them was it distracted from the flavors of the dips. After ordering our Gyros I asked if it came with anything I was told no but I could add fries which I was going to do but the waiter told me the gyro was very large so I decided against it. Now let me qualify my review of the gyro by saying I have eaten and loved gyros since I could walk, I have been looking for a good gyro shop here for a while and have had to settle for just ok....that being said this gyro was not very good. it was really low on toppings, based on what the waiter said it felt almost like the cook only made one gyro then instead of making another just split the meat and veggies between the two. The meat was not 100% meat there were obviously a lot of fillers. It left a lot to be desired I may go back but more than likely I wont."}
{"text":"Service ok. Lamb shawarma over hummus was good and a generous portion. Add the hot sauce. The kibbeh was meh. Decent food close to campus. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I just tried this restaurant and all I can say its wow, the food is amazing. I got the lentil soup which was full of flavor, the falafel appetizer was the best I've had in a very long time. I also got the kafta kebab, it came with two sides. Great portions and excellent flavor. The owner was very nice and even gave me a chicken wrap to try. Omg, I'm a fan, it was delicious. I'm definitely going back and recommending it to anyone that enjoys good food and excellent service for a very affordable price."}
{"text":"This was a random stop for us while we were coming back from Concord Mills and passing through Charlotte. We checked some local options and this place sounded great. The restaurant is quite nice inside and has very nice atmosphere. Casual and relaxed but with some nice decorations. The waitress was very nice and checked on us regularly. The food was incredible! I had shawarma was excellent and all of the sides and salads were delicious. The food was very visually appealing and looked extremely fresh. I was here with my parents who are pretty narrow in their food choices but they really enjoyed the gyros, so I guess there is something for everyone here. Definitely one of my favorite new restaurants I've found in recent memory and one I hope to revisit the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So....today I visited this restaurant and well....I didn't even get to eat. We were seated by the hostess ( she was very nice ). Then waited to be waited on. Then waited then waited. Nothing happen. So I noticed 4 gentleman walk in. Thought nothing of it. I guess the owner came over and asked us to slide our table over that that 4 top can be used. Meanwhile there we're 2 tables available. One in the front by the door and outside. I just was ready to go. The \"owner\" the tried to make me stay. I just wanted to leave. She then followed me out the restaurant and still tried to make me stay. She caused a scene when there was really no problem. I just didn't want to eat there anymore. I felt some type of way being asked to get up to accommodate other ppl when I was already sitting down."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, restaurants in Charlotte. I have probably been 6 or 7 times now and ordered the same thing every single time. It is just so good..  I order the mixed shawarma (chicken & lamb) over hummus. The seasoning/flavor/texture is perfect. It comes with pita, but is good to eat even without. I don't know if I like the lamb or the chicken better so I just go with the mixed. Throw some hot sauce on it, and it is the perfect meal.   I have never had to wait for a seat, and the food typically only takes 5-10 minutes to come out. The portion size is deceiving.. It is a ton of food, and for a great price!"}
{"text":"When you venture off to le Kebob in the mid afternoon, just right after the lunch rush you come across an almost ideal lunch experience. Alongside the ample space to choose from to sit in and no waiting for food/waiter your able to truly indulge in the delicious atmosphere/cuisine. Here you are served up the freshest Halal arabic food alongside streaming sounds of Egyptian pop music. I say Arabic food loosely as the food here touches on multiple countries cuisine. So if you like certain regional specialties like kosharee you are most likely going to like the food here. It's fast fresh Arabic food done right! Order the hummus!"}
{"text":"First time here. Will go again. Food is unique and prepared perfectly. Because we were first timers we  were given an appetizer while we decided what to order. Great service. Lots of attention. Relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time tonight. We got the chicken kebobs with rice and veggies and hummus, all of it was delicious! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Clean, casual and friendly atmosphere with wonderful customer service! Oh yeah and the FOOD!! The most authentic Middle Eastern food I have eaten since visiting Jordan and Lebanon. Everything on the menu that I have tried has been fresh and excellent. Nothing frozen here. Staff is happy to recommend their favorite dishes. The staff is always so welcoming and friendly. I plan to eat here often!"}
{"text":"We were in the University area looking for something to eat a bit later than usual. A quick Siri search offered several options, but this seemed like a good choice.  We arrived to find the atmosphere nice and the place busy, even at about 9pm. The clientele seemed to be the types interested in something authentic. Plus, in the University area, they were expecting a good deal.  We started with the falafel appetizer, and we both really enjoyed it. Very tasty.  My wife ordered the mixed kebab - three kebabs on rice with mixed veggies. I ordered the Turkish kebab with the rice and the lentil soup. We both highly recommend the soup. It was delicious, and we'll be making it ourselves in the future.  The kebabs were all cooked very well. Seasoned and spiced very well, and very tasty. The rice was light and very flavorful. The only miss of the meal were the mixed veggies - apparently a nod to western tastes. Avoid them and get something that comes from the Mediterranean.   The service was pleasant, and the place stayed busy. Overall, this is the best kebab/Mediterranean meal we've had in Charlotte, and we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped here after getting my hair done in the university area at the suggestion of my fellow yelpers for a quick dinner.   The service was speedy but welcoming.  I ordered the lamb over hummus and a tabouleh.  I was a bit surprised at the price (close to $20) but once I saw the portion I understood.  I was told that they didn't have any more tabouleh and was over the fattoush salad.  Sure, I'll try it.  After about 7 minutes my order was ready and the owner appeared and said that he made a tabouleh salad for me which is what took so long ( 7 minutes is not so long at all sir!). He also told me to keep the fattoush salad at no extra charge and tell him what I think of each.... how nice! The owner spoke briefly about their plans for expansion of the location and was very nice. The tabouleh was very tasty with the right amount of acid and it was served with a Meyer lemon which added a nice touch of sweet and bitter.  It was the best tabouleh I've had.  I wasn't crazy about the fattoush.  It just wasn't my jam... the lamb over hummus wasn't bad although next time I might try it over chicken.... yes there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding and the food was excellent as well. This was a great pick. I wanted something light but savory and this little place hit the spot. Clean and has a good ambience.   You should definitely give this place a try!!! Food was delicious and reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food..awesome atmosphere.. Love the ambience.. Went there for lunch , ordered grilled fish and grilled chicken. Both were served over rice with salad and dressing. Loved the taste. Personally I'm a huge fan of middle eastern food, but never found the right place until now. Would definitely re visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service.   Would def recommend. Their garlic sauce (dip) is the best!   The quantity they serve is actually more. If you are ordering a starter or dessert you might need a to go box.   Def would recommend this place"}
{"text":"My wife absolutely loved chicken shawarma over hummus. I've been a regular customer for the past two years. About time, the menu needs some updates. But overall a fantastic Mediterranean food place."}
{"text":"I went two times to this restaurant and had a bad experience each time. The food was cold when I went the first time so when I went the second time I decided to let the waiter know that food should not be cold like it was last time. Food arrived, it was cold again, I guess the owner came by and I told him it is cold he snapped and said that  \"bottom of the plate is hot\" and then I told him he can try the food, he went back and brought the food after microwaving the food and said you were right the food was cold, at least he was kind enough to admit it."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about this place. The service and staff are wonderful! The food is amazing! It's perfectly seasoned and the flavors are what I imagine true and authentic Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean to be. I usually get the Lentil Soup and the Combination platter with Falafel, Baba Ganoush and Yalanji. The falafel is second to none in Charlotte! The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable! If you are considering Le Kebab, do not hesitate! Go!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. The food is yummy and the service is great. Everyone is very friendly. I've tried most of the menu and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a must visit place! Not only was the food authentic but the service was wonderful! We were treated like family coming over for dinner! I would highly recommend this place and plan on coming again!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food - which was delicious - was the service. The fella and I stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday around 11:45, and by noon, the place was hopping. And our waiter was just about the nicest, friendliest, smile-ist person I've ever met. Maybe because he eats there all the time and it makes you happy?  I got the kofta (beef and lamb) kebabs, and the fella got the chicken kebabs. We were just boring enough to get the same two sides, too - rice pilaf and steamed veggies. He liked my meat better than his, and I liked his meat better than mine, so we gave each other one of our two kebabs. His chicken sauce was like a spicy, Crisco, and my sauce was tzatziki but a little thinner than I'm used to. The rice was almost sweet... and I ate almost all of it.  All of that was only $21 (we both got waters), and the service can't be beat. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Happy to report that service has definitely improved!  I highly suggest going during Ramadan. It is over August 18 this year, but that last day will probably be very busy.  They have a nightly buffet for Ramadan. Get there by 8:15 to secure a table, but eating (and drinking even water) doesn't begin until 8:35. Technically, if you aren't muslim you can eat before then, but it would be very rude.  Everyone else there will have been fasting since sun-down. About 8:25 people will start lining up to fix their plates so when the time comes, they are ready to eat.  Go and get some great food and witness a cultural holiday different than your own!"}
{"text":"Never fails me, never ever! Love it, every time I go. Also it's great that they are open a bit late."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! It's possibly the best restaurant in the University Area... definitely in the top 3 and probably top 10 for Charlotte as a whole. My top favorite things are  -Grilled Chicken Entree  -Lentil Soup (if something I order comes with 2 sides, I usually get double soup because it's that good) -KUSHAREE (this is why I'm writing the review) it's their Monday special. I'm not sure if they have it available other days of the week but they should! It's a vegetarian dish (possibly vegan, you'd have to ask to confirm). It has lentils, some macaroni noodles and lots of flavorful rice into a single dish. It comes with a mildly spicy sauce (it comes on the side so you can control it... I used it all). Plus, it is topped with caramelized onions. YUM! My husband who lives and dies by animal protein regretted not getting this. I'm a self-proclaimed flexiatarian and participate in meat-free Mondays so I'm glad it was last night's special.  We usually do take-out because they don't serve alcohol which I'm assuming is due to religious/cultural reasons but I WISH THEY DID!!! As a suggestion, I think they should offer beer and wine, at least, and then those who do not partake can abstain but those of us who would like to wash down our Kusharee with some cold beer could do so in the restaurant rather than at home. In the meantime, I will keep ordering out and going to Food & Wine in the same plaza before heading home."}
{"text":"12/4/17, 6pm.  Once again, good service.  Great food.  All kinds of people eating there! :)  Highly recommend.  On a sad note, it appeared that someone had vandalized one of their entry doors (smashed the glass), sad that people are so ignorant."}
{"text":"The menu is ginormous with so many options. After casually looking through it, my eyes locked onto the picture of the lamb shank and rice. When the waiter asked for me order, I literally pointed to the picture and said, \"I want that.\"   The meat was super tender, and the red dipping sauces that came with the dish was delicious. The portion on this dish was more than adequate. They could have gave me half of the and I might still not finish.   The environment here is casual. They try to decorate the place to have a slight middle eastern feel. It's a great place to catch up with a friend, which was what I did.   I had a pleasant experience here and would recommend this place if you're hungry for some middle eastern food."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic! There were four of us and tried both soups, the lamb kabob dinner and a chicken kabob wrap. It was all really good.  We also had the baklava and a flan, leave room for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Let's get to the point. Food and price was excellent. Quite different. About a month ago, my girlfriend and I went there during lunch time at noon and it seemed pretty busy so while taking our time, we felt rushed, even though it was our first time there and was deciding what to order. The table we had was really small to where we better finish our appetizer before our entree gets there or we'll have no space to put them; the place itself was pretty packed in and tight. Definitely worth trying but do pick a good time to go in to eat.  P.S. Now to the single men out there, there's a beautiful hostess who works there so put your game on and see if she's single."}
{"text":"I went really late on a Monday night, order a mix of kabobs, rice and soup. the food was o.k. the flavors did not jump out. I was hoping for something better, it could have been an off day. I hope the next time is better if I come back to the area.   On the staff, friendly nice and helpful."}
{"text":"One of the best veg falafel wraps in the area! Loved it.. perfect crisp and taste for the mouth!"}
{"text":"We were so glad to find this place in the University area! Charlotte needs more Middle Eastern restaurants. We had the falafel, mixed grill plate and hummus for two, which was more than enough food. It was all really, really good. You can't beat perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked kebabs and keftas. I want to try the lamb next time. The service was great as well. Only complaint was the music was loud and the CD was skipping or something which was driving me crazy. But I will definitely be back. They have a bunch of wraps and sandwiches as well. Reasonably priced, we got out for about $24."}
{"text":"In no way am I Middle-Eastern food expert, but I do like to enjoy it occasionally!  We headed here on a Friday night to grab a late dinner.  The restaurant was packed, but we got lucky and snagged a table close to the front.  They also have outside seating and the full menu is also available to go.  We started our meal with Hummus and Pita.  The Hummus was fresh and we were given a hearty portion.  There was a red pepper swirl through it which was awesome!  I got the chicken Gyro made with the chicken that is off of the swirling meat roaster.  haha I do not remember the proper name!  I do not eat Lamb though the traditonal gyro looked great.  The portion was huge and it came with one side for around $8.  My boyfriend got a Kabob meal with rice.  He loved it and said this place is going to be one of his regular spots.    The acutal meal did take awhile....I'm not sure if we looked ancy or what but one of the chefs hand-delivered us a dipping sauce for free  because of the wait, which was delicious!  You can tell this place is family-owned and everyone was incredibly friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"THE PLACE to go for FRESH falafels! OMGosh they do it right! I am a newly-aware falafel freak and ever since I have made the discovery, this has been my go-to place for Mediterranean food. I have had other dishes Here including chicken kabob, falafel wrap, falafel appetizer, geek salad...I recommend trying it all.  I have yet to dine in here, but the times that I have gone the staff is always nice and the restaurant seems very clean. It will vary greatly with the potential language-barrier with some of the staff, but in the end They are very accommodating. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating isn't on an enclosed patio so be prepared to be just kind of out there on the sidewalk. But it's cool :-)  They do take quite a long time if placing a carry-out, for obvious reasons (freshness perhaps) so I do recommend calling way ahead. The parking lot is usually the devil, but that is the least of a concern. It's certainly worth wiggling in and out of the awkward, Always-packed lot!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will certainly return to grab lunch during the week! A lot of food for not a lot of money! I had the falafel and fries for less than $7."}
{"text":"Love the food, prices are decent for the amount of food and service is great. I tried the lentil soup which tasted fresh and tried a chicken and rice plate which was very good."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. After reading the reviews, I really had higher expectations.  The decor is nice and the staff super friendly. I had a good experience in the restaurant.  I ordered the chicken kabob pita sandwich, fries and the flan.  The chicken kabob pita was pretty good. There was a good helping of garlic sauce and veggies. It is a little messy to eat as liquid keeps seeping out. No matter. Just have napkins on hand. The fries were standard. No salt on them. But they have ketchup on hand.  Now the flan. Cheese based flan. Yum! Best part of my meal! Good texture - smooth. Right amount of sweetness - meaning not overly sweet. And the caramel sauce was enough so it could still sweeten it up!! Perfect.  Would come back for the flan. Maybe not the rest. But they do have an extensive menu...."}
{"text":"These guys have the best Shawarma in town. So far the best I have eaten. Try the Chicken shawarma over rice/hummus."}
{"text":"I've had several different Schworma's there chicken being the best. the best deal they have is the two chicken Schworma wraps. I get that with the Tabulli which is pretty good, a little heavy on the Bulger wheat but pretty good for Charlotte"}
{"text":"Mediocre falafel sandwich, Ive had good falafel and this was ... mediocre ...this is a long as it gets because it does not deserve more...    if you are ever in Dallas check out \"Food From Galilee\" restaurant. They make the BEST Ive ever had."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. The food is great and service accommodating. This was our first time dining here and Our waitress was receptive and explained many of the entrees. I ordered the Turkish kebab with a kalsip  rice. My daughter ordered the white rice with chicken kebabs and mixed vegetables. The meat was very tender and seasoned well. The pita chips, hummus, falafel. I could go on .... we will definitely come back and have other items as well. Le Kebab Grill is rated high on my return list"}
{"text":"Great Chicken Shawarma & kebabs! Took our kids there and the kids loved it too. The baklava was fantastic as well, made in house. Prices are really low and the owner came out to talk to us for awhile, very personable. Having lived in Europe for a number of years this is very similar fare to what you would find in kebab shops there. Will definitely be back. Atmosphere is average strip mall style but it's good food at fast food prices so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Very tasty gyro sandwich, mixed shawarma plate over rice, lentil soup is fantastic and the guy working the front is very pleasant to deal with. One of our go-to places, stays open late."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, huge portions, and the employees are very nice. I like the falafel and rice best!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. The chicken kebabs were juicy and well spiced. Great rice too! Hummus was thin, but tasty. The grape leaves were serves HOT which was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Everything was on point. The service was good and the food was even better."}
{"text":"Fantastic hummus! As well as the kabobs. Fresh and tasty! The people are friendly and inviting. Great prices and nice atmosphere.  A place definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Took my first trip to Charlotte ever and the first thing I ate wasn't fine southern cuisine but good Mediterranean food.    Le Kebab is a small place with outside seating.  The inside is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful with the menu (for those that aren't as familiar with Mediterranean food).  I had the lentil soup, house salad and  lamb kebab.  My friend had chicken wings and the beef kebab.  The food was good and the prices are fair.  This place deserves another visit."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and Le Kebab Grill popped up in my yelp search! It was so delicious, I ate there twice in the five days I was in town. The staff is friendly and attentive, the food was excellent both times as well. I wish it was in my hometown! I tried the meat pie and it was yummy, the kebab was also great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had a chicken kabab tabouleh salad, it was so refreshing and light. The service was great, very warm friendly environment. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted a good gyro for once in Charlotte.  This was the place for it.  The tea was good too.  I had the knafeh dessert for the first time.  It was light tasting but something about makes me want it again.  It was pretty too with orange coloring.  The waiter I had was attentive.  Next time I'll try a national dish like that shawarma as he suggested but I was sort of time for a big meal.  I have better faith that the shawarma may be good here than another place I tried days later."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The Turkish coffee was full flavor and a treat as well. The staff was friendly and made very good recommendations on what to eat and drink."}
{"text":"I have had a craving for hummus and kebabs for some time now, and been meaning to try this place. I'm really glad that I did. We ordered an appetizer combination, which allows you to choose 3 items from a list of about 6. We selected the hummus (extremely smooth, almost creamy, and a good portion), falafel (seemed a little denser than I'm used to, but still yummy), and the grape leaves (I am not a huge fan in general, but I tried a bite and liked them).  I was kind of disappointed that none of the 4 kid's meal choices were anything middle eastern at all. It was all the same hamburger /chicken nugget fare you can get anywhere. I opted to have them share a chicken kebab plate, and my husband and I had other varieties. There are 3 kinds of rice available: plain basmati, mandi (which is yellow and mildly seasoned), and kapsa (which is light brown from all of the spices! It's not hot spicy, but has such a fabulous flavor punch. I really enjoyed it) As our second side, my husband and I chose the lentil soup, which was also very flavorful. Overall, service was fairly attentive and the food will definitely merit a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing falafel wrap.  I live south of Charlotte but every time I'm in the neighborhood I stop by and get their wrap.  I have introduce this items to many of my friends and they are hooked."}
{"text":"First time trying this sort of food and have no regrets. We are already planning on another trip next week if that tells you anything! Only complaint about the place overall is the music (turn it down a little) and the odd heaters placed here and there? Also doesn't look like they've done any updating since this place was Yoshi's but I can get over ALL of that bc the food was great! I had the lunch special: chicken kabob with 2 sides for $6.99. I chose hummus (they spelled hummos?) and rice pilaf. The hummus was a $.99 up charge but well worth it. Some of the best I've had and I'm a huge hummus fan. The rice was delicious, had I had any more room to finish it, I would have! The garlic sauce/dip to spread on your meat...MMMMMMMM!! Slather it on the chicken because it's gooood! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I just got an absolutely five-star takeout lunch from these guys. (Or really more like 2 lunches because their portions are humongous, be warned). I hadn't been over for a while and the menu has changed quite a bit. Today they had a special on that was a very rich Jordanian dish, lamb with yogurt sauce. They were very funny and pretty much required me to try a sample to taste because they thought it was something I would not be familiar with and therefore I might not like it. But, with lamb and yogurt you basically can not go wrong. It smelled fantastic. The lamb was nicely cooked and the sauce managed to be creamy and tangy, almost lemony, at the same time. Now I want to come back and try all the specials."}
{"text":"Well... I was seated quickly but didn't get served til 15 minutes later. The server looked our way several times but didn't come. Finally I had to ask another server who our server was and she had to tell him, TWICE about his table. Service right now is what dropped the rating.   My friend that was with me had orange and black specks in his water and I had black specks in my tea. Had to get another server to fix our drinks because our server was, once again! no where to be found.   The price is great. And from the looks of everyone else's plate since I still haven't gotten mine after about 30 mins, I can't tell you how it tastes.  As I look around... I see that those around were served quickly, while friend and I, whom are African American, we're not waited on as quicky. Very disappointing. I may venture to Bread and Kabob from now on."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to Le Kabab and definitely not the last! Delicious chicken shawarma! Nice and hot, had plenty of meat and sauce! Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Every visit the staff and food were excellent. However a few weeks ago the waiter and I had a language barrier and another staff member took over. My food wasn't as good as past visits but I will go back. Everyone has an off day at some point."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant. I had the full, the falafel and the lentil soup. I really enjoy the falafel but the full and the lentil soup had no flavor. It wasn't the missing salt but rather a lack of ingredients to make the full. And the lentil soup was watered down. Good thing I order enough falafels.   This place did have great service and I'll probably try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've eaten. Everything is authentic and delicious. I enjoyed my lamb and rice."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  Truly incredible.  The service was quick and fast.  The food spoke for itself. I got a Gyro.  The lettuce, tomatoes, onions were all fresh.  The lamb was very good.   The taziki sauce was delicious.  The pita was fresh and soft as well.  I wish that this place was closer to where I lived, because I wouldn't definitely come often."}
{"text":"When we're in the area we always come to this place. Food tastes fresh. I recommend to anyone that like Mediterranean food. I do recommend to have more meat than rice. But over all food is great. Price is ok."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area from out of town and popped in for a quick late lunch/early dinner. The staff were very friendly and service was attentive. I had the vegetable kebabs and had the plain rice with it rather than the pilaf and I am so glad that j did. Their basmati is very well seasoned and just so tasty! Veggies were tasty and well seasoned as well. My husband had a chicken shawarma pita and had no complaints. Only room for improvement bit for us was their house dressing, which I could tell was made with lemon juice concentrate rather than actual lemon. It left something to be desired. I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"An amazing middle eastern experience. Perfectly done cuisine.  The falafel were the best I've ever had, they were insane.  I ate like a glutton. Had some hummus some grape leaves, lamb shawarma.  Everything made you crave even more. Make sure you save room for dessert.  Their baklava will make your knees buckle. They dust the pastry with pistachio crumbles!!!!!  BEST EEVVVAAA"}
{"text":"First impression was excellent.  Several people welcomed us as we arrived and were seated.  The waiter asked if it was our first visit, we indicated it was.  He went over the menu in detail and then brought us complimentary samples of a couple appetizers (a falafel each and a sample of both the hummus and baba ghanouj.  I had the Gyro plate and my girlfriend had the Gyro wrap.  Mine was service with a large portion of rice and steamed vegetables.  A great lunch for two for less than $20!  Everyone was very friendly from the time we arrived until we left.   I don't know that I'd be in the mood for Mediterranean food every day, but if I was, I'd definitely go to Le Kebab again."}
{"text":"Simply awesome. Ate here 2 times in 3 days. If it was closer I would eat here probably every other day. It's that good."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Charlotte! We love the hummus, falafel, Chicken Molokia, Shwarma, Baked Chicken, Gyro Wrap, Baklava! The people who own it are super nice and love their customers!"}
{"text":"Great service from the owner himself, really good gyro wrap and beautiful finish with kunafeh."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service and quick hookah. The wraps are large and filling.  Good menu with many lamb, beef and chicken options.  Good spot for messa and hookah."}
{"text":"The food is great. My favorite is to get the appetizer sampler with 3 different items. The prices are pretty cheap compared to other restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  You will not be disappointed. The hummus with pita chips is  great as a starter.  I usually get lamb or chicken shawerma. It is seasoned to perfection! Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte from out of town and decided to take my sons here in Mothers Day for lunch. Based on the Yelp reviews I was really excited to try this place. When we arrived we were seated quickly and our drinks arrived promptly. This is where the good ends. The wait time is unacceptable. Diners who arrived after my sons and I were served before us. After waiting over 30 minutes with no mention of how much longer the wait would be I decided to try take the food to-go. As I was leaving the food was coming out. I explained to the woman at the front that I would like to have the food to-go if they would box it up for me. She was argumentative and made implied I was trying to get something for nothing. I'm standing at the register debit card in hand and no one is assisting me. I waited to see if they were going to box the food up and take my money. No one ever came after a few more minutes so I decided to leave.  I wouldn't ever return again. I was treated rudely and the place is just too slow. I will spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very authentic and great flavor.  We found this restaurant via Yelp, and were very pleased with what we found.  There was a great atmosphere, with cultural decorations and music playing.  The food (appetizers, drinks, entree and dessert) was all phenomenal.  My fiance hadn't had Greek food previously, and it won him over.  We had a pick your own appetizer, where you picked three of five items.  Then we shared the entree of three different kebabs over rice with a side.  We had baklava for dessert.  Everything was excellent.  My favorite was the beef kebab, which is saying something since I am mostly vegetarian these days."}
{"text":"I get really excited on my way to a Mediterranean restaurant. Love the idea of fresh kebabs with rice n garlic sauce. This place disappointed me a little...ordered lamb kebabs. They were moist and tender but no real spice or flavor to them. And sadly sadly they DO NOT come with garlic sauce...bummed!  Though i did ask for it but i guess my server just forgot about it. Had real high expectations based on reviews here, but I will give it another try by ordering lamb/ chicken shawarma as i see that's mostly pictured here by reviewers."}
{"text":"My friend had been saying he loved this place so I decided to check it out. At first I was confused what to do when I walked in because there were a lot of coworkers in the front who were trying to tell me that I could sit anywhere. They seemed to be overstaffed and the waiters and waitresses spoke so softly that I could barely hear them. Despite that the environment was nice. There are a lot of cheap options on the menu and they give you a big proportion! The hummus is amazing!!! You have to try! I don't usually like hummus, but this one is a must. I believe I got shawarma chicken with the yellow rice. It was very filling and the white sauce that come with it makes it taste even better. I got a salad as the side, but the dressing was a bit too much. I couldn't even eat more than two bites of the salad because of that. Besides the salad, I would recommend eating everything! Its amazing! Trust me. I'm not a big Mediterranean person but somehow this place got me."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant - music, staff, food - all wonderful! Had lamb, mixed shewarama, lentil soup - homemade sauces were amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is a mall food court level of food, with especially substandard produce. The food pictures on the menu look nothing like the actual dishes that come out and when I complained about the horrible quality of the non-ripe tomatoes that came with our meal I was told that \"not all tomatoes are supposed to be red\" and the tomatoes pictures on the menu were \"photoshopped.\"  This place is an OK option, but I wouldn't recommend, especially if you're looking for Greek food."}
{"text":"The hummus was really good! The pita bread was okay wish it was more airy. We got a lamb plate with rice it was okay!"}
{"text":"My man had heard about this place, and since we were in the area we decided to stop in, and so glad we did!  We had an awesome waiter named Basher, who answered all of our questions and was very knowledgable about the menu.  They were even nice enough to customize our meal for us.  We wanted to try the fattoush and tabbouleh but didn't really want the big huge salads, so they gave us smaller portions for a smaller price!  I love flexible places!  All of the food was AMAZING!  We got the lentil soup (warm, hearty, and yummy!  great for the cold evening!) a small side of Tabbouleh, very well seasoned, a small side of  fattoush, also very well seasoned, (many places i have had it, it is too bland), and a Lamb Shawerma Wrap.  We asked them not to wrap the wrap up so we could take pictures, and they were very obliging!  Let me just say I have never been a fan of lamb, but this was AMAZING!  I would definatly get it again.  It was well seasoned and yummy!  Especially with the tahini sauce.  I've had tahini sauce other places and it is, often too tart, but here it was smooth and flavorful without being too tart.  And then we ended with some mint tea.  Also very nice on a cool evening.  I am looking forward to going  back here again!  The prices are very reasonable and they aren't skimpy with their portions.  Staff was very friendly.  Service and food were both 5 star!"}
{"text":"Our server Khaled was great giving recommendations and was constantly coming to check on us to see if we needed anything. I noticed the other servers were very customer friendly as well. Small little restaurant with about 4 times as many people working than eating so the service was extraordinary. As far as the food, I've had better but it was still good. I feel like they toned it down on the spices to make it more acceptable to the general public. I had the chicken swarma over rice with a salad and the chicken was slightly dry. We also had the kofta kebab with rice and steamed vegetables. It was very little meat compared to the massive amount of rice. The meat was alright but would've been better with more flavor and seasoning. The steamed veggies was perfect."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time this week for dinner. It was quiet, which is expected for a weeknight, but their kitchen must be good because there was always a customer coming in for a take-out order.  I ordered the baba ghanouj and the falafel wrap. The baba ghanouj was flavorful and a very generous portion was brought out - enough that I needed more pita bread. The wrap was good - it also included lettuce, tomato, and tahini sauce.  Friend ordered the gyro entree - the presentation was a little unexpected but the flavors were good and with 2 sides included, it was a satisfying portion.  The server was friendly and attentive.   When the warm weather returns, I'll be interested in trying their hookah!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place immensely!!! The food is way too good to be so affordable. The only mildly unpleasant experience I have had at Le Kabob was the one time I asked for a yogurt  beverage. It was ok but I got way too much. The wraps are great and the music and decorations are interesting but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Le Kebab Grill serves hot, fresh Middle Eastern food that I'd put against any restaurant of similar cuisine in the area.  For our appetizer, we got the sampler plate with falafel, hummus, and yalanji.  The yalanji was soft and delicate with an excellent flavor.  The falafel was expertly fried and perfectly seasoned, and their hummus was delicious and as smooth as it could be.  It was the perfect prequel to our entrees.  I got the Kofta Kebab plate with an extra skewer of kofta, and for my sides I chose tabouleh and rice pilaf.  The kebab itself was amazing...they must use charcoal in their grill because it has a delicious smoky flavor and is perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The tabouleh is tasty and refreshing, though slightly overdressed.  There was basically a puddle of lemon juice in the bottom of the bowl, so I couldn't quite finish all of it as it'd be too overwhelming.  After the starter and my entree, however, I didn't have room for it so I'm not going to take off a whole star for this one tiny misstep.  The rice pilaf was perfectly seasoned, delicious, and there was a metric ton of it on the plate.  Le Kebab Grill is an excellent restaurant and a great value.  It's fast, casual, and high quality.  If we lived in the area, I'm sure we'd be here a lot more but it's well worth the trip and we definitely stop in when we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food is amazing. They have great hours, open later in the area than other places. Serving authentic great food."}
{"text":"The food is Delicious!  Best Mediterranean restaurant I have been to. The menu has a lot of variety. The employees make it that much better."}
{"text":"I'm far from an authority on Middle Eastern food but the staff appears to be native and family members. There is a small stand way off to the side promoting the Islamic faith so if you're offended stay home and reflect on why you're so offended by someone else's belief. I've been here on 2 separate occasions and it's been excellent both times. My wife has both times ordered the chicken with herb stew and raves about it. No idea what I ordered the first time but it was great. This visit I ordered the Mixed Double Schwarma and lived it as well. Just fine here and ask any questions as the staff is happy to provide any explanations."}
{"text":"Good experience and great food. Order just took awhile and we still had issues with what we ordered vs what we got"}
{"text":"This place friggin rocks! We were first timers and they welcomed us with an wonderful patio table and some samples of their appetizers. Their hummus and  baba ganouesh is on point! Best saffron rice and gyros I have ever had. Healthy portions, great staff, and amazing price point. Thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until I went there on a date. It was good, the food was good, the atmosphere was good, and the staff was really friendly. I know I'm not being super specific, lol, but I would go back again for lunch or dinner. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch and it was ok. I lived in the Middle East and I know what Arabic food should taste like, so I am particular. I would go back again."}
{"text":"One of the best places I ate in a long time I love Mediterranean Muslim food it was very good the flavors exploded in your mouth no pun intended but it was very good I recommend to go back to the lamb shawarma was very good and a shish kebabs were amazing the lentil soup was perfect and the service was great also very cool relaxed atmosphere very peaceful would recommend to go to this place even though I'm a Christian I put my religion to the side for good food this place is recommended to come in eat"}
{"text":"First time at this place. I was amazed by the great customer service, incredible food and tastiest hookah. Thank you so much for such hospitality, I sure will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great service!  Arij, was our server and such a sweet attentive young lady.   Food was good and the 4 of us all got something different and liked all dishes. Greek salad was excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is always good, my favorites are the fried Chicken special on the weekends, hummus and falafel"}
{"text":"A-OK is a rating that makes this place worth visiting.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I was with a friend and had to hurry up and eat to get to another engagement.  I wanted more, either more portion, more of a particular sauce, and/or more of a particular flavor.  I can't put my finger on it but I think this place has 5 stars hidden in it with a particular tweak.  I wish I had the inspiration to let you and the owners know what to do, but this is why I don't run a 5 star restaurant, that and I don't have a passion for running a restaurant.  My advice is to try this place out without expecting too much, and also don't have a lot riding on the event.  Such as a critical second date with someone you really like.  I might recommend going with some laid back people that like everything.  Then you can try multiple dishes and figure out the solution to me ennui with regard to Le Kebab.  3 Stars from me is still a good rating, if you look at my profile I am not stingy with the 1s and 2s, not because I am crabby but because I try a lot of places once that in hindsight you should try zero times.  This is not a try zero times place."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot in Charlotte.  Amazing food!  Everything is fresh, authentic, and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and portions excellent for price. However, the service leaves a lot to be desired. After initial drinks/order we were mostly neglected. Took awhile to get the check/box."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Great food!  Great prices!  Our waitress was informative, attentive, and responsive.  The manager came back to ask how our meal was and to solicite our input on new dishes and sauces."}
{"text":"The food was great! The chicken shawarma and the beef kebabs are delicious! The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I was craving it and it definitely fulfilled my satisfaction. I had the chicken shawarma over rice with steamed veggies. Great lunch place!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but wait time and service were awful. A table that was seated AFTER us got their food before us. We had to track down our waiter for our check and to-go boxes. I wouldn't mind eating the food again, but only on a take-out basis. Service was much better and less pricey at a nearby restaurant, Bread and Kabob."}
{"text":"Few & far between are the places that warrant a 5-star review. Even big chain restaurants with money to burn often miss the mark. The food is fresh, clean, good, hot, tasty, what else can you ask for? We bypass other mediterranean restaurants in Charlotte to come eat here. The yogurt salad is good, that's coming from someone who makes it from scratch at home. You won't be sorry you stopped in for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place because I'd eat here every day! My favorite here is the gyro wrap and the chicken shawarma platter. Somehow the chicken shawarma platter and sandwich taste different but are both equally good! They also have some delicious rice plates as well. The other dish I absolutely love is their tabouleh salad. Ask for pita with it, the combination is yummy! The restaurant itself is very cute and cozy with outdoor seating if you want to sit out. Plenty of parking available too. Be careful with directions on google maps because the location is incorrect on there. This place is next to Jimmy John's. They also have hookah, although I've never tried it here."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick and affordable! We ordered the hummus to start - so good we almost licked the plate clean. We finished it by the time the waitress came back to get our orders. Our waitress was so sweet and answered all our questions. I was craving a plate of chicken and rice and Le Kebab delivered! The portions are huge; I got two meals out of one plate. I would gladly eat here again - to stay or to go. I would come back for that hummus alone."}
{"text":"Food was great but girl waitress slow cold tea A little pricey but rent is high in the area"}
{"text":"OVERALL: Best food in university.  Service: attentive and curteous. Ambiance: Casual cafe style. Food: filling portions, simple dishes with complex flavors.  The Mozat (lamb shank) is the best lamb I have ever had.    Location: good for 2-4 people.  It is next to Jimmy Johns / near Total wine, not Picasos where the GPS takes you"}
{"text":"The food here is ok. Their shawarma sandwich always tastes old! The falafel sandwich is pretty good. Also the hummus and salads are tasty too. I recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place had the most healthy sized servings ever! We had \"Mozat\" the lamb shank with rice and it was so amazing! The lamb literally fell right off the bone! And the sampler appetizer was great as well, hummus amazing! I will return to this place on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  The wrap combo is my favorite, one beef one chicken gives a nice variety of flavor.  We bring small children and the servers have always been very kind."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Le Kebab with my girlfriend with the plan of trying a few different appetizers in the afternoon. We weren't sure what to get but ended up deciding on the mixed shawarma over hummus to split instead of apps. It was awesome! The chicken and lamb were both super juicy and full of flavor. The hummus was perfectly balanced - you could taste a bit of garlic, some tahini, and olive oil but none overpowered the other elements. The free pita bread with it was great as well, and they'll give you an unlimited amount according to our waiter; we didn't get extra as we had just enough for the dish. We actually planned on having more than one dish but it was huge and we were both full after since it was just an afternoon \"snack\".  Great deal for $11 for the huge plate, the flavor was superb, and the service was solid."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and great food. We stopped by on my way to drop family at the airport and were delighted with our meal. I got the chicken kabob pita wrap and loved the garlic sauce. It didn't seem like a lot of food, but I was quite satisfied once I finished it. Everyone else loved their dishes too. What really set this place apart was the service. My sister is gluten-free and forgot to ask about the dish she ordered being gluten free. She got fish that ended up being slightly breaded, and the staff was SO NICE about it. The waitress got her a fresh menu and the two of the guys from the kitchen came out to make sure she could get something to fit her diet (usually not an issue at these types of places). She ended up with chicken on a bed of hummus and they subbed in some veggies for her to dip with. All the people who came by came by with a smile and wanted to make sure she was happy. I really cannot say enough for the exceptional service of the staff."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Price is very reasonable, and the beef was grilled to perfection - juicy, tender and flavorful.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"1st review-This is good casual dining restaurant. Staff is friendly. I  been coming here for dinner many time.They have very good lentils soup. I like that, but I got twice a uncooked chicken kebab.Value is ok. I would say . 2nd review-After my frist review we visited again and had a dinner. It was awesome  and well done.Staff was keep asking about food . I appreciate they looked in my review."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the service is too! I always get falafel as an appetizer (it's great!) and try something new and it's always a winner"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but food was bland and portions were small not mention it took forever to get our food. Sorry to say not going back."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best mediteranian restaurants I've been to in US and definitely the best in university area. Food quality and quantity are both reasonable. Good variety of dishes. I've tried almost all the items on their menu and I really can't say which one I didn't like! The staff are nice and friendly. The only catch is that the tables are a little bit sticky sometimes, although they have been cleaned. It's probably because they use only damp cloth to clean them and leave them wet."}
{"text":"This place is very authentic! Everything from the music to the decorations gives you the experience, if you've never been to a Mediterranean restaurant before. I had the Lamb and Chicken over rice (the one that's pictured the most in here) it was definitely worth the $11.00!! So much food and everything was delicious. I hope to come back when I get a chance.  Also, ask for the pita chips!! They will only give it to you if you ASK :)"}
{"text":"Very helpful and friendly waiters. Yogurt drink is really weird lol, but you can have a sample first so have a try if you're interested. Desserts are tooo sweet, even can see the sugar juice falling down. Huma and pita, burger looks good tho"}
{"text":"I finally made it out to try this place! My uncle was raving about it for months and it didn't disappoint. It's tucked away behind several other shops and restaurants and has ample parking right outside. The inside is simple and there's plenty of space for larger parties. I did not like their versions of some \"basics,\" namely the grape leaves and the hummus. The falafel was good and the mixed grill plate I had with the fattoush salad was awesome. I split it with my sister and we still had tons of food. Others at the table tried the shrimp kabobs, shawarma, and a variety of salads. Everyone was very satisfied. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolute, hands down, best food.   Very very kind staff.   This is a favorite for me.    Portions are very large so one order can be shared with 2-3 people.  Hummus is amazing.  Also falafel is great."}
{"text":"Oh, my, GOD. Their lamb gyro/wrap (comes looking like a burrito) is super delicious and perfectly seasoned! And too salty can really ruin the taste of their tzatziki sauce! Super fresh and juicy lamb. It's definitely not hard to finish everything in one sitting, as it's too delicious to put down! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"My love and I decided to come and give this place a try for dinner.  The atmosphere there is calm and casual and the staff is nice and helpful as well.  I ordered the chicken kabobs with rice pilaf and steamed veggies. It also came with a little bit of garlic sauce ( wish it was more sauce). The food was pretty good the chicken could of been a little more tender.  My love had the falafel pita and some lentil soup. He loved the pita so much he went back the next night to get another one. I also tried it, it was pretty good and the portion was a good size.  We would more than likely go back again!"}
{"text":"I went due to the high reviews! And I have to say that I left happy. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. When I asked to sample the soup he brought a more than generous serving that was almost enough for my 6yo to eat as a meal! I had the falafel pita wrap along with a side order of rice. My 6yo shared with me.  The rice portion was very large. My 9yo had the kids chicken skewer with rice. His rice portion was also very large.  The seasoning looked very generous on the  chicken.   Everyone was more than happy with the food. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is for take out. Let me start by saying I really want to give this place more stars as I really liked how things looked walking in and I so want to find a good solution for my Middle Eastern food needs in the area.  Called my order in ahead which went very well, the guy on the phone was nice and helpful. Was in a hurry on way to the Panthers game and there were three of us so IlI ordered three double chicken shawarma wraps with fries.  Everything was ready when we picked up and again, people were friendly and the ambience of the place looked really great. I want to go back and try some of the rice and grilled meat dishes I saw being served while I was there.  Unfortunately our take-out meals were below average. The wraps themselves were decent, nothing spectacular. A lot of pickle flavor, the chicken was just fine.  The fries were horrible. They had no salt on them and I am quite sure they were left over fries that has been thrown back in the fryer. Dried out and tasted like the oil was not fresh. Really bad.  In a small plastic dish was a white sauce. I was hoping for tzaziki sauce or maybe a yogurt dip but instead it was a garlicky mayonnaise. Tasted just like garlic stirred into common mayonnaise. Yuck.   We all commented that Fast Food would have been just as good. Here's hoping I can go back and give them a fair try sitting down in the restaurant and ordering off the menu."}
{"text":"First time having a lamb shawarma and it was actually good! Not like your typical gyro that's served open-faced and with sliced meat, but rather diced meat and more like a wrap with the same contents that a gyro would have (lettuce,tomato,onion). It's served with a tahini sauce that's very light, and it doesn't have the same texture as other tahini sauces would. I will definitely be coming back to try something else!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Visited 4-5 times and had chicken kababs, chicken wrap, hummus and  they all were amazing. Will visit again when next time I'm in CLT."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic cuisine that is moderately priced and served in generous portions. You won't be disappointed, late hours with a full menu I went there thrice and the food never disappointed me. The service offered was top notch and the staff were really friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic Middle Eastern Food! The Lamb Swarma was tender and flavorful, chicken was good but lamb the star! The Kibbeh and Meat Pie were really great and the kebabs were grilled perfectly! Overall great food!"}
{"text":"Went to Le Kabab today for lunch and ordered from the dinner menu.  The food was truly outstanding, and the portions were huge.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout for tonight's dinner. They were quite busy with a private party and tons of takeout orders. I was debating between the falafel and the lamb shawarma. Per the nice cashier's suggestion, I ordered the lamb shawarma with a side of fries. After a 7 minute wait and admiring the clean, well-kept interior, my food was ready. When I opened the box, (2 minutes afterwards) I was saddened by the lackluster and limp fries, no salt or seasoning and not cooked well. Nothing special there. The shawarma was chocked full of lamb but was only topped with a hefty amount of raw onions, tomatoes and a little sauce. None of the other toppings listed on the board were present.  The pita was sadly store-bought and served room temperature. The lamb was tough, lukewarm and lacked flavor. I had to go back in just to get hot sauce which made it tolerable but it still wasn't the flavor journey I was expecting. Maybe I just came at a bad time given all of the good reviews. Unfortunately, I have to admit,  I've had better shawarma off street carts.   3 stars for cleanliness and good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We were served by a husband and wife team who were so pleasant. I asked our waiter for a suggestion and he said his favorite was the grilled chicken. I am so glad I went with that choice. It was delicious!  This place made me slow down and just enjoy the atmosphere and the food. My husband and kids really like it as well!"}
{"text":"Though I no longer live in Charlotte, I try and make it a point to visit Le Kebab when I return to visit. It's always consistent, fresh, and delicious. I highly recommend the falafel and chicken/lamb combo shawarma plate. The lamb shank is also amazing."}
{"text":"Good!!! In our second visit we ordered a Kafta kebab and it was really good! The falafel and the yellow rice are just delicious. The baklava is even better! We will surely be back"}
{"text":"If you want something a different then go. I love lamb. The lamb shank was tender and at an amazing price. The falafel was not my style. It lacked seasoning compared to the greek and other kinds. The have meatless options which are nice if you are dining with a vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Great service and great food  The rice here is the best. Everybody should definitely check this place and you can even smoke hookah."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! Food came out really quick and everything was fresh. Tried a bunch of stuff on the menu and haven't had anything I didn't like . Try the sweets, the kanafa is amazing! Also try the half sweet tea half lemonade drink , it's great!"}
{"text":"I am a lover of all foods ethnic, and Le Kabab Grill does NOT disappoint! Growing up in a Lebanese/Irish home, my mother, grandmother, aunts and uncles would always bring the best of the best out of the kitchen on holidays, family reunions and special occasions! I cannot sing the praises of Le Kabab enough! The Falafel is out of this world- Crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside! I typically eat the Kofta Kebabs which are simply amazing ( if you like a lamb mixture), and the Lebneh and Baba ganoush are amazing as well! Definitely a must try! As for atmosphere, I wouldn't expect too much as this place is quite small doesn't have a bar."}
{"text":"Everything was very tasty.  A little on the expensive side.  I got babaganoush and I really enjoyed it. The service was a bit slow, as I was on a time limit and in for lunch.  I would go back again to try more things."}
{"text":"The lamb was very tough and chewy today, and it looks like they also got rid of the seasoned fries and replaced them with regular crinkle-cut since the last time I've been back.  Kinda sad about it."}
{"text":"Coming from middle eastern descent, I always have high standards for middle eastern food. Le Kabob exceeded my standards.   I began with an order of hummus which was served with fresh pita. The hummus was light and the added olive oil was a nice touch. It tasted just like my father's and I was impressed. It looked just as great as it tasted.   For my entree I ordered the chicken kabob pita wrap. The meat was tender and juicy and the pickles were nice touch. Overall very good! (Be aware it is not served with sides)  Overall I enjoyed my lunch and will be back again. Service was good and prices reasonable!"}
{"text":"My husband were in the mood for Middle Eastern food so we tried Le Kebab based on the good reviews, goes to show you can't always believe the reviews. We ordered hummus which was good (that's why i gave it 2 stars ) but the pita bread wasn't very good, I didn't think it was fresh. I had the Greek salad with chicken, I didn't like it. My husband had the gyro plate with veggies but he didn't care for it either."}
{"text":"My sister and I had heard very good things about this place from our coworkers so we went last Friday. We started with their Lentil soup and it was delicious. We followed with a chicken and lamb wrap and I could not pick a favorite one, our waiter disappeared for a little while and he seemed a little nervous ( it remind me of myself on my first job at a restaurant) but overall the service and flavor of the food were very good."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and I happened to have tilapia and it was very delish! Good for falafels, kebabs and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm not well versed on Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, but I enjoyed my meal. I had the  Shawarma Mixed double. I thought the chicken was much better than the lamb, but I didn't hate it.   Although I had take out, I had the opportunity to interact with some of the staff. For the most part, they were friendly and helpful.   I think I'll be back and try some new things. This place has piqued my interest and I'd like to explore their menu further."}
{"text":"Overlooked and under appreciated hole in the wall Middle Eastern food.  Le Kebab has excellent food.  I have brought two middle eastern friends here and they confirm the cuisine is authentic.  One of them would drive from Rock Hill up to University area (40 minutes) just for this restaurant.  The key items to try here include the chicken shwarma, gyro plate, and lamb kebab plate.  Other items of note include the Vimto juice drink, lentil soup that is served with most dinner plates, and the baklava.  Le Kebab also provides excellent garlic mayonnaise, tzatziki, and tahini sauces .  The portions are a bit large for one person, but the food heats up well as leftovers.  I cannot speak to the hookah aspect of the restaurant, but there are regular customers who partake in it that swear by Le Kebab.  The hookah customers never seem to affect other diners with smoke smell or crowd the restaurant so I've never had that as a problem.  Parking is generally available and food is served quickly dine in or carry out.  For the money Le Kebab is an incredible value.  A meal for two will generally be under $25.  Ownership/management is always around and friendly, and I have never had problems with service there."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Such friendly staff. Gave us a free appetizer each time we went. Lamb chops and half grilled chicken with rice were awesome! Not from the area. Loved it so much we took a 1 hour detour to come back to eat!"}
{"text":"This was the surprise dinner of the year! My son's friend works here and he wanted to go visit his bud. He (my son) told us the food was good but he's 15 so who the hell listens to food advice from a teen!?! (NOTE: This excellent review has absolutely nothing to do with knowing an employee. If I didn't like it I would just have not reviewed it out of respect to him.)   Le Kabob is situated in the back portion of The Promenade at the corner of Harris Blvd and North Tryon. It is a fairly unassuming place in a corner spot. They do have their name in letters on the top of the building but other wise just a very small sign that hangs above the door.   We walked in, there is a counter to order to go or they will seat you and send a waiter your way. We did the latter.   Bottom line is: The food was EXCELLENT! You get a falafel plate after ordering (like an Italian place sends bread). They were outstanding. And the Baba Ganoush (apparently that's blended spiced eggplant, which I generally despise eggplant) was wonderful as was the humus (which i generally love).   I got the slow cooked lamb shank with rice, my wife got he lamb kebabs and my son got the mixed kebabs (Chicken, lamb instead of kefta and beef). Each plate was super tasty and cooked perfectly. They all came on HUGE beds of insanely well cooked rice (as a cook, myself, I can really appreciate rice done so well.) We also order the chicken wings for an app (white people, am I right!?! I am right!) Not sure the spice blend but they were yummy and crispy and very good as well.   So, as a lesson to all of you with kids: Every now and again they get it right. I wanted to eat there again the night afterward but got shot down in place of burgers/steaks) I was bummed. This will absolutely be one of our go to joints on the reg. And as a bonus, the prices are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent shawarma and kibbeh. Staff was friendly and very welcoming. We'll certainly be coming back to enjoy more of the delicious food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with my wife.  Staff was very attentive and welcoming.  When they heard it was our first time eating there, they gave us small samples of the hummus, baba ganoush, chicken shawarma, and falafel.  All of the samples were really good.  We ordered the dinner with three kebabs: chicken, steak, and kafta.... All of them were awesome!  The rice was great as well.  Also got a chicken wrap and a falafel wrap.... Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went there last night for dinner. I did a mediterranean tour, Israel and Egypt in the Navy and this food did not taste the same. I guess for Charlotte it is doable. The food didn't taste bad but somethings were different. Maybe the water? I don't know. The service was excellent. The prices were reasonable. The place looked clean. We got there @8pm and had plenty of parking with no wait time for table. I guess I would return if we were in the area but not go out of my way."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lamb Shawarma. Enjoyable restaurant and friendly staff.  Keeping this short but I would definitely return and be a regular if we lived in town."}
{"text":"I have no clue what half the menu items are nor how to pronounce them, but the folks here are so nice and helpful that it's never been a problem. And omgosh everything is delicious! Even the picky kids like it here. We normally order take out, which sometimes takes a while to prepare, but that just lets me know it's freshly cooked. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with my experience here - this is a 4 star Mediterranean restaurant per Charlotte standards?? C'mon guys."}
{"text":"Worst hospitality I have ever seen in America ..I am totally disappointed with the way one of the waiters behaved with me today..I paid dollar 15 for just a plate of vegetables I started the Buffett around 10 pm and they closed in next 15 to 20 minutes with no intimation. Then I asked one the staff for a cup of fruit they had and she went inside to get me ..meanwhile the men staff who spoiled my day came and told we don't have anything left inside but I know there are lots of fruits they kept inside. On the  counter when I paid I said what had happened and that gentleman went inside again to bring me some. But this time again that person who said nothing left again came to me and asked sarcastically do u guys have any problem as if he does know anything ..I noticed they had a conversation inside in front of me on what I asked. Attest if they don't have the fruits they should got us something and said sorry. I was waiting for few mins and finally no one came and I ended up paying 50 dollars for 3 buffets. We dint really eat anything and went for another restaurant with hunger. I will never go to this place in my life time. If anyone from the store wants to discuss call me at 201-245-1315. I recommend no one go Ther and there are plenty of Middle East restaurants which are really good. Plz try those Instead of this. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love the food here, hopefully they can upgrade their sizes. ;)"}
{"text":"Me and my husband want to try something different and we like so much he gets lamb gyro wrap and I get Kofta and were so flavorful."}
{"text":"My husband & I tried Le Kebab out for the first time this past weekend & we both enjoyed it! We just recently arrived back from NYC where we tried the famous \"halal guys\" food  truck as our first introduction to mediterranean food, and since then knew we had to try a local place to see if  we loved it just as much.   We started with the hummus & pita & falafel. The hummus was a perfect consistency..creamy & smooth with just the right amout of roasted red pepper & chickpeas on top. It was delicious. The falafel was pretty tasty too,  For my entree I had the chicken shawarma (thinking it was similar to what I had in NYC) the chicken was tender & seasoned perfectly but I was not a fan of a spice in the rice. My husband had the \"combo shawerma\" consisting of lamb/chicken & he loved.  The portions are large & the wait staff were nice. We will go back if in the University area!"}
{"text":"Updating my review. Food is still delicious, the wait staff are super nice. However, it takes forever to get your food and forever to get your check and forever to actually pay and leave. Annoying."}
{"text":"Amazing Food and great prices. Will definitely come back. The lentil soup is very hardy and filling. Great spot to go with family or friends."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of time and tried different things.  All of the food has been great and they give you huge portions.  The only downside is sometimes the service is a bit slow getting you seated and waited on."}
{"text":"I have driven past here for years and finally stopped by with my husband. Wow! What have I been missing all these years!?!  We arrived late after a long day of work,but we were greeted in a very warm and friendly manner. Even though it was already 9 pm, they made us feel welcome and the food was hot,fresh, and amazingly delicious.   The portions are generous,the food is fresh, they use quality authentic ingredients, and you can tell the the chef takes pride in their work and their food. Even the rice is full of rich aroma and flavors!  Thank you for an awesome dining experience, authentic and rich food, and kind hospitality!"}
{"text":"Salad with chicken skewer on top for lunch was the bomb. Fresh ingredients. Piles of lettuce/cucumber/ tomatoe/ green pepper. The chicken was moist you could tell marinated well with good flavor and grilled to perfection. Soo good and also felt very healthy. This was reasonably priced. Other items on menu were a bit pricier and this is a sit-down place but maybe the flavor is worth it? I will try the other items eventually ! Oh and one of the ? Hostesses was super friendly (African American older female) - made you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Tabouleh, grape leaves, hummus, lamb, all were very good. Service was fast, efficient and polite.  Well done."}
{"text":"Went here twice in two weeks for lunch with coworkers and I was happy both times! The appetizer bread is to die for! I usually get an entree because they are large enough to take home and have dinner too.  I just wish the sandwiches/wraps came with a side. Seems kind of pricey when you add a side and then the meal is just too much for lunch, but not enough to really take with you."}
{"text":"I got carry out here: (vegan) spinach pie (appetizer). 3 to an order for $4.99. I LOVED this item. Perfectly seasoned sautéed spinach filling. It wasn't oily at all. My order was prepared correctly, ready when I arrived, and prompt/friendly service. There is indoor and out door seating. Pretty location. I would come again!"}
{"text":"I only ordered a falafel wrap. It was good! The atmosphere was nice. The bathroom could use a little care. The woman that took my order was friendly. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent kebab,  and delecious lentil soup  you will enjoy  each and everything from the menu . I love to visit here again and again"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Each time the experience was great. I've tried the gyro plate, Turkish kebab and chicken plate. The rice was fragrant and delicious. The quantity was enough for leftovers and the meat was well seasoned and soft. Excellent service! Decent price wise too. Not too upscale, but a good place that caters mostly to the university folks."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere. The chicken kebab pita was very flavorful and filling. Hummus was excellent too."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a few days ago,  Had a craving for kebabs so I was more than happy to see this place just about 5 mins from my home, but I  ended  up with a less than happy experience.   Customer Service- We were greeted when we entered the restaurant   and  was promptly given menus by the waiter.  He did not introduce himself , just put the menus down and left, nor did he ask for drinks. A few minutes later he came back to get the drink order , I had to ask him what his name was,  Overall  though the wait staff was nice , but didn't really speak English well , so it was very difficult for them to explain  dishes. Everything was \" very tasty\" or \"very good\"  The Food-  The food was simply not good.  The steak kebabs for $10.99 was 2  small kebabs piled on a LOT of rice.  I've received bigger pieces of steak from the mall Mediterranean place  in DC. The rice had a weird taste , the pita bread was cold and served in a plastic bag. It would have been nice to have warm bread.  The hookahs are only $10.99 , so If I ever go back it will be for that .!"}
{"text":"Nice place and food ..  I had chicken shawarma plate, soup with nice spicy rice.  good and tasty"}
{"text":"This place serves the most delicious middle eastern food I've had in Charlotte.  I've had the falafel, hummus, labaneh, chicken kebob, chicken shawerma and the sweet semolina cake.  However, once I had the shawerma, I could never order anything but that.  It's addicting!  The flavors are intense and bold.  It comes with a buttery garlic topping on the side which is divine.  The servings are large, especially if you order rice as your side.  The side salad that comes with the platters is crisp, fresh and with hints of parsley and lemony.  Just writing about this is making me want to have some chicken shawerma!  My husband ordered the lamb shawerma and I tasted it.  It was also very good but the chicken shawerma takes the cake!! On my first visit the owner brought us a free sample of their hummus.  We were already stuffed but ate it out of curtesy and it was delish.  The service has always been friendly and hospitable and my orders taken accurately. Overall I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great little middle eastern restaurant. I had the kofta kabob with yellow rice and a side salad. The kabob was good as well as the rice but what I really loved was the yogurt that came with it. It looked like they made it in house and it was great to dip the kabob and rice in. We had the hummus and pita as an appetizer- probably some of the best hummus I've ever eaten. We also had the baklava which was a little smaller than I wanted but delicious and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"The food at Le Kebab Grill is great! Everything tastes extremely fresh.   Appetizers - The hummus is absolutely delicious! Lots of fresh soft pita bread. If you love hummus there is really no comparison when you get delicious fresh made hummus versus the stuff you get at the store.   Lunch Special - You can get a skewer and two sides for a reasonable price. I usually opt for the kofta skewer, lentil soup and a salad. The lentil soup is very good. The salad comes with a delicious oil and lemon juice dressing that is very light and fresh.   I have also had the gyro wrap and french fries. The gyro wrap is very good, the meat is soft and tender. The fries are crinkle cut.   Service seems to be hit or miss here. Some of the servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Other times you get a server who seems like they just walked in off the street and aren't really sure what's going on. Also some servers are very good about timing what comes out when with your order and others not so much. Today our waitress was awful. Only came to one side of the table and asked us to pass food and pass our glasses for her to refill. It just was bizarre, like she didn't realize she could walk around to the side of the table. She also brought out french fries about 10 mins before our entrees.   One take away when you look around at other patrons in a restaurant is if the ethnicity of the food they're serving matches that of the patrons - when I visit this restaurant there are always middle eastern patrons. This tells me that the food must be pretty authentic and GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST middle eastern restaurant in the University Area!   I've eaten here so many times that I think I've had everything on the menu. I'm definitely a regular and bring all sorts of friends whenever I can.   First of all the food is super fresh and quality. Which really makes a difference for the flavor.   As far as the food you have to try the Kafta Kabab!! It's incredible! So flavorful, I don't know what spices they use but they are incredible!"}
{"text":"This place is a good value and staff are very attentive.  Portions are huge as well.  The last time I ate here I ordered the chicken over hummus and the chicken was very overcooked and very difficult to eat, so next time I will stick to my usual chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"My initial thoughts of this place \"unorganized\".  I ordered to take out. He asked me if I called. I wish I had. There seemed to be a long wait.  However, I didn't see any take out menus.  The place looks legit tho. I have been waiting to eat some good Mediterranean food.  I got my food, here's the after thoughts:  It didn't take me that long of the wait.  I ordered hummus, fattoush, and gyro combination plate.  The food was ok.  From the time I got my food and back to my hotel, was probably less than 10 minutes.  The fattoush was very soggy, as if it's been sitting in the dressing for a long time.  The rice that came with the gyro was very soft and soggy as well.  Not sure if the rice is done how they like it or it's a mistake.  I have never had soft and soggy rice at other Mediterranean restaurant.  The hummus was good and I like the gyro.  The price of the food is a very good bargain.  If you want some cheap, ok taste Mediterranean food, this is not a bad place to be."}
