{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Katsu Don (Fried Pork cutlet with egg) and Fried calamari

Katsu Don is very good, the cutlet is bigger and thicker than I expected. But the calamari $2.99 is too expensive for such a small portion (5 small calamari rings) .

I will definitely return to try the curry dishes.

{"text":"This place has great authentic Japanese food. My family and I ordered both the beef bowl and the deep-fried chicken bowl to go. Note that I got this to go and did not experience the way the waiters did things. 

The bowls also come with miso soup and a small salad, which we missed reading in the menu. The deep-fried chicken wasn't too overly fatty or anything, which I quite like. Overall, the food was tasty. 

For desert, I would recommend Tsujiri (ice cream) or Uncle Tetsu (cheesecake)."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Hong Kong, I often visit Yoshinoya, aka the McDonald's of Japanese Beef Bowls. For about $30HKD (equivalent to $4 CAD), I would have a delicious bowl of melt in your mouth beef + rice.

Like Uniqlo for clothes, I'm dismayed we've yet to see Yoshinoya appear in Toronto. Thus, I could not resist a visit to Gyugyuya when I walked by it one day. Could this be the North American Yoshinoya I've been waiting for? 

The answer is: sort of 

In terms of decor, I'd say the shop is done right. The colors are bright. I like that water is served in metallic mugs. Service was good, although understaffed. I ordered the curry+beef, which was good. The beef was excellent and authentic tasting. The curry tasty, although I'm not a Japanese curry expert so you can't trust what I'm writing. The portions were ok sized, but I eat too much. 

All in all, I would say Gyugyuya is like Yoshinoya in terms of tastyness but nowhere near in value (perhaps unfair comparing it to a chain in Asia...). I plan to return here in the future to try the Beef Bowl without the curry, which I think is the best bang for the buck. However, with tax+tips, I don't think this place is a particularly good value for what you get, which I think is what really holds it back from being a place I would visit more frequently."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant opening a couple of weeks back and was super excited about a japanese curry restaurant opening right next to my favourite ramen place! So I went with my sister to try it out.

The decor was cute but it was definitely yellow overload (way to much in fact). Usually I don't mind the music that restaurant play but this definitely was not fitting the setting as they only played rap and country music which I found very strange....

We ended up ordering the Gyu cheese curry and Tonkatsu curry. I wouldn't say the curry sauce itself was particular amazing or mind blowing; it was okay and nothing special. But I did find the curry very watery and ended up turning my rice very mushy after a while. The beef was tender and juicy, same goes for the Katsu.
They added cabbage and a boiled egg at the side but it wasn't so very appetizing so I decided to pass on that. 

I do have to say one thing was that I do eat with my eyes first and the way the food was presented wasn't the best as it was served in metal peasant-like bowls. It would've have been better if they served it on a regular plate or a bowl.

Overall it was an alright experience but I'm not sure I would go back again :("}
{"text":"I had the pork curry (tonkatsu). It was good. Pretty distinct flavour for Japanese curry. Their miso soup definitely deserves a shout out. Best miso I've had in awhile. Overall pretty average. Good for some soul food on a wintery day."}
{"text":"Ordered the don katsu curry and gyu curry!  Ive personally been to japan many times and have had many gyu don's.  This is not bad.  Good beef, curry can be improved and pork cutlet can be crispier.  good friendly service.  Still have some way to go to be comparable to ones in japan."}
{"text":"A good standby in the neighbourhood. If you're looking for Japanese curry, this is the destination. Decent sized portions, reasonable prices and most importantly - tasty food. 

Never a lineup but the place does fill fast for the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"A very close second to the Japanese chain GoGoCurry. Down to the taste of the curry and metal bowls. Had the Katsu curry and the Gyudon. The Katsu was juicy, tender and crispy with just the right amount of fat. The curry has that distinct deep and spicy beef stew flavour. The beef bowl wasn't too bad. The beef was good but lacks a bit of flavour and the sauce was a bit watery as there was a huge well of sauce at the bottom of my bowl. The accompanying shredded cabbage salad left little to be desired. Had gyudon better elsewhere. 

Decor is rather bland. Lots of yellow. Washrooms are blue though. Again, reminiscent of GoGoCurry. 

Overall experience wasn't bad. Service was good and the food came quick for lunch period. Price is a bit on the high side for what you get. I'll come back again if I'm in the mood for Japanese curry."}
{"text":"Great tasting authentic curry and gyudon. Had a cheese and beef curry and it was great. Also had a gyudon bowl although I feel that one isn't as worth for the price since its simply rice with beef slices ontop. Cozy place!"}
{"text":"Good value for the price.  Was very filling. 

Got deep fried chicken and egg on rice. came with awesome miso soup and some type of salad. 

Overall the food was alright."}
{"text":"Friendly service, the food as the star ranking suggests was a-ok. I would have to agree with some of the reviews here, the curry does taste like the instant curry you can buy from the Asian supermarket.

I ordered the Nabeyaki Curry $10.99 which consists of egg, sausage, cheese, vegetable, curry with rice in a stone pot. Looks like the picture on the menu. However, I found this dish to be lacking ingredients as there was only one sausage, a half boiled egg and two pieces of broccoli on top of a bed of rice topped with curry. I found my friend's dish- the Gyu curry to be better tasting $11.99. Generally for both dishes, I did find it to be a bit too salty.

I would recommend those who haven't tried Japanese curry to give this place a go just for the experience. For those who have tried, I would say it's nothing really special and might want to consider trying some place else."}
{"text":"Everything deep fried is so tasty at this local spot. I love the curries and rice. Superb. Will be back."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try Japanese curry; however, it didn't taste as delicious as I've expected. On the other hand the chicken was good and fried well!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on curry, but it was delicious. We ordered the beef curry cheese rice dish (forget the exact name) and the curry and cheese combo turned out great! Large proportions (we both shared the one dish and were fairly full afterwards) and an \"authentic\" curry taste (doesn't taste like the powdered Glico curry from T&T) make this a great place to try! Only caveat is that if you're driving to this place, it's insanely difficult to find parking."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.
I've had Japanese curry before in Japan and in Toronto.

I've ordered the first one on the menu, Ton Katsu Curry (basically thin port cutlet and bed of rice and curry sauce on top). The cutlet was overcooked and almost bunt, curry sauce was nothing special and no other pureed veg content. I've looked around make sure mine wasn't a mistake so I looked others' but they looked same.

The taste and presentation reminded me of curry that I had in a food court in Markham."}
{"text":"I had the ton katsu curry (pork cutlet) $10.99 with extra toppings of cheese $0.99 and chicken karage $3.99 on the side. Total, tax and tips, was $20 and I shared this meal with a friend. It was enough for the both of us on a not so hungry lunch.

What I liked about the dish was that the meats were seasoned really well. Both the pork and chicken were deep fried where the outside was crispy. Not to mention they were so tender that we can cut it apart with the utensils, which is a spork. 

The curry lacks a bit of flavour. It doesn't have that depth.. that deep aroma that makes people salivate. Also, I wish they give more curry sauce for the whole dish. Part of the rice and meats barely had any sauce by the end of it.  I like it on the saucy side, just my personal preference. 

Service was great. The ladies noticed we were sharing and asked us if we want extra plates and promptly gave it to us. Refills tea/water without being asked. Really attentive staff.

This place have the cheapest katsu curry dish in the area. Neighbouring Japanese eateries in Baldwin and near Eaton have it at $14.99+. My curry place to go to when my crave hits.


PS
Make a Hamburger Steak curry! I would def go for that."}
{"text":"I've been eye-ing this place lately because of the yellow inside and the lineups that would reach the doorway. Luckily, when we arrived at 5pm , there was a short lineup (approx. 5-10 minute wait), but people kept coming in. As we waited, the aroma of the food triggered our stomachs: salty, spicy, beef-y. I guess the wait was beneficial in that it made the food more worth it.

The place can seat maybe 30 people max. in the mixture of tables and booths. The service was surprisingly quick despite the full house and awaiting guests. The menu awaiting at the head of the line-up is also useful in the fast service since you could choose out of maybe 10 items that they serve. 

We ordered the cheese & beef curry ($12.99) and the karage (deep fried) chicken curry ($10.99). I haven't had japanese curry before, but it was de-li-cious! It was slightly spicy that our noses began to drip, but not burning. The beef is marinated so well and very tender. You can just use your chopsticks or spork and dig in. The bowls are about the size of a chipotle bowl, so they're satisfyingly filling. 

Would come here again for sure! I want to try all of their items :) Lost one star just because of the lineups. Shout out to the Kingdom Hearts playlist that my guy recognized and added to the experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a Japanese curry or Katsu expert but the food here was good. Japanese isn't my favourite type of curry, but wasn't bad. Casual place for a very affordable meal. Got the pork and you get a ton of food that was quite satisfying."}
{"text":"So like other reviews I think the beef bowl could use more meat.  My husband wasn't quite satisfied but luckily my tonkatsu was huge so I shared my fried pork.  All in all it was tasty but I'm not sure I'd go running back.  The bill for two meals and a pickle dish came to $26.00 and change before tip....it just seemed a bit much considering one of us was still hungry when we left!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Tasty Japanese curry. Karage chicken curry is a must order, very filling"}
{"text":"I came here mainly because I saw that they had gyudon on the menu. Being a huge fan of the Yoshinoya chain, I thought that perhaps that I would be pleasantly surprised. It's definitely a restaurant that is easily to spot because it's bright yellow, both inside and out. I got the Gyudon which came with miso soup and a coleslaw. The gyudon tasted flavourful but I found the beef to be a bit tough. They give a decent amount of meat so it wasn't just rice. The service was average."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here. It's the type of place you'd come for a good chat with friends while gorging down on a one-handed easy to eat meal with their super cute spork!

The Japanese Curry, ton katsu (4/5): Great taste! Big serving O_O It's not too salty and I felt I had enough curry to cover all my rice and meat without saturating it to the point that it became soup. The meal comes with a small portion of lettuce on the side that I believe could be more, to balance out the heaviness of the meal. Their chicken katsu was thin and cooked with a nice crisp panko layer, while still being easy to cut into with their spork :) I thoroughly enjoyed this meal and was definitely stuffed at the end of it. Will return to try their gyu curry that my boyfriend had and it looked just as yummy.

Cost (3.5/5): This place is a bit on the pricier side for Japanese curry ($10.99 and up), but you are definitely not getting scammed. It's still a large portion and care is taken in making the curry taste great with presentation matching that of their wonderful picture menu :)

Service (3.5/5): Like typical asian eateries it can be hard sometimes to understand their waiters/waitresses, but with some patience this isn't such a hindrance and you always treated with a smile and table service is there right away when you ask for it.

Ambience (4/5): ALL YELLOW! It's bright and cozy, with the tables being spaced out and a decent distance from each other. It's not particularly unique in any sense, but its clean and the staff is welcoming. Although, it can be loud when it is full."}
{"text":"Solid, cheap Japanese style curry. Gigantic portions. (For those unfamiliar, Japanese curry is based on yellow curry powder, with lots of black pepper, onion and a slightly soy flavour. It's a thin, brown sauce).

We got the gyu cheese and pork katsu don. Cheese curry obvious winner --it's not a cheese sauce, but rather shredded cheese on top of a portion of the curry rice. Features thinly sliced beef over a bed of rice and smothered in curry sauce. You can add cheese to any of the dishes, so if you want a different type of curry you could make your own. Katsu don was very plain with no sauce. 

The interior of the restaurant is very clean, but the colour makes you feel as though you're inside of an egg yolk :)"}
{"text":"I don't know any other restaurant in Toronto specializing in Japanese curry, so you could imagine my excitement when I heard about Gyugyuya. I decided to come here with my sister last night. They don't take reservation and the restaurant is rather small, but we got here at 8pm on a Thursday night before long weekend, and it's still not too too packed. 

The food was quite good for the price. We ordered the Tonkatsu Curry and the Gyu Cheese Curry. Every piece of rice was well coated with curry sauce. The curry sauce was average - I have definitely had better. The beef and cheese combination was interesting and surprisingly really good together. I just wished there's a higher cheese to beef ratio. The pork katsu was well made and went well with the curry. 

The complaints I have for Gyugyuya are all aesthetics-related. First off the restaurant is really really really yellow. The whole yellow and black combo just screams cheap. The yellow was honestly hurting my eyes, not to mention how it messed up my phone camera's white balance (major first world problem, I know). Also, what's with serving your delicious dishes in metal plates? I am sorry, but they look just like prison food trays. Food quality is important, but so is the presentation! 

Complaints aside, I will definitely come back for the curry. Probably eating with my eyes closed though."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Japanese curry and have been spoiled by working near Kaiju.  I was happy to see another curry eatery nearby so we decided to try this place.  Overall, I won't be back.  I was disappointed by both the service and food.  

Food:
Had the chicken katsu don and tonkatsu curry pork don.  It was disappointing.  For this price, other places offered better tasting curry and larger potions.  In my opinion, the curry was too sweet, not much  vegetables and curry taste is overpowering.  

Service: 
We waited 20 mins at the door even though there were empty tables.  There were not enough servers to even seat us.  After we sat down, we were not even given water until we ordered and asked for water."}
{"text":"Their curry is typical Japanese restaurant style curry(curry without anything in it, they rather put stuff later) which you won't see that often in Canada... so If you want to try it, it is worth it... but personally I prefer homemade style(with veggies and meats in it).

Note: People saying their curry taste terrible, but I disagree on it. If you eat curry in Japan you will have curry with same taste with this restaurant. So... If people think this taste nothing like Japanese curry, people are comparing to homemade curry rather than Japanese restaurant style curry...

But what I like about this place is that they have very tasty gyudon (compared to all other japanese restaurants which serve it). It taste like gyudon that you can eat in Japan. 

(If you are going to order gyudon, order onsen-tamago[half boiled egg] with it)"}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants I keep coming back to when in downtown. It is most famous for its unique Japanese curry, sweet and flavorful. Their beef is very tender and well marinated, which I love it with the cheese curry. Karage chicken has a good crunch with juicy center. Good portion, generous amount of curry, good and quick service, fair price. There is usually no line-up if you go earlier."}
{"text":"I had my first Japanese curry dish here and it was really good. I'm a huge fan of how extremely yellow this place is. It can get busy and you might find yourself waiting quite a bit, but it's definitely still a hearty and filling meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant, we ordered the curry rice with curry cheese and sausage, and the chicken jatsu don. Tastes pretty good, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The Tonkatsu curry was great... But beware of the bill!!! They sneakily added tips in the bill asking you to pay and I unknowingly double tipped them!!!"}
{"text":"Curry tastes really good! I had nabeyaki curry. Cheese x onsen tamago combo is yummy :) Personally, I wish it had more veggies. I think it is fairly priced."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef curry. This had rice, thinly sliced beef, egg, cheese, and cabbage underneath a curry sauce. Found the whole dish to be filling but the food was salty. It was too rich because of the cheese and egg but the curry flavor wasn't that strong. I think the japanese curry I make at home is better. Won't order it next time since I don't think it was that special. Mayhe I would try their katsu curry if I returned to the restaurant.


Service was fast since I was the first customer of the day. It seemed like the waitress kept an eye on me too much. Constantly asking if I was ready to order or if I was done with my meal. She was nice but I just felt rushed."}
{"text":"Love gyugyua, every time I'm in the area I make sure to eat here! I love the curry and the service is great. Sometimes there's a line but I usually get lucky and won't have to wait for more than 10 mins. Not the biggest fan of the don but all their food is still great!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, however there wasn't much of a curry taste. The food didn't taste as good when it cooled down. Food came out quickly, and the servers were nice. I would return to eat here again."}
{"text":"After being back from Tokyo for 3 months, my fiance and I were craving for some good Japanese curry. We came here for dinner last weekend and I ordered the chicken curry and the fiance ordered the beef gyudon.

In Tokyo, it was very typical for you to order a gyudon dish and it comes with a raw egg on the side. My fiance tried to request for this but they seemed really clueless and it took a good 5 minutes for them to understand what we wanted. That was an extra $1.

Food was ok-- the curry definitely satisfies the craving. But the beef gyudon wasn't anything to rave about.

I did not like how they included a mandatory tip. The only \"service\" they really provided was taking your order and bringing the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good!!!!!!!!! I will return for the beef blow!!!!!!!!!!! OMG that's so good.... The curry is also very good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has almost no lineup compared to its neighbour Santosei. Not because apples to oranges comparison, but probably because this place isn't all that good (and all the craze is ramen). 

The main deterrent to the cutlets is the sauce. Its so weirdly sour. The combination with the fully cooked egg is a no no. The cutlet itself was meh, not too tender. 

Some good things about this place is the vibrant yellow paint. Made it stand out from the rest of the place in Little Japan, Dundas. Also the fast service."}
{"text":"A good place for a quick lunch. This reminds me of my high school food court. The curry is just right with the fried pork and rice, perfect for a cold day in winter, although it's a really warm winter this year in Toronto."}
{"text":"* Price: about 10-13$ per dish
* Ambiance: Casual, crowded/noisy at night, might need to wait in line
* Service: Alright
* Food: Simple gyu dons and katsus, can't mess that up, they're generous with the curry
* Health: Definitely do not come here if you're counting calories"}
{"text":"Fair quality Japanese curry - lean on the curry sauce, but want to charge $5.00 for extra sauce."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not gonna lie. Gyugyuya wasn't my first choice, we were atcually headed to Sansotei next door.  But the line up was way too long.  The Japanese curry was amazing, they gave you enough for all your rice.  I got the chicken karaage curry.  The chicken was super crispy and chicken was moist. One of the better karaage I had.  The price is on par with other Japanese curry places around $10-12 a main entree.  The portion was decent for 1 person."}
{"text":"I tried the beef rice, it was delicious and very similar to what I had in Asia. And my friend's curry dish smelled yummy as well!"}
{"text":"- the fact that toronto now has a place dedicated to japanese curry is a big deal.
- it's good curry. not amazing (if you're comparing standards to japan)
- tried the chicken katsu curry and it was pretty decent. had a little heat to it.
- karaage was average. 
- would come back if i had a craving and didnt make this at home."}
{"text":"I discovered Gyugyuya Curry when lining up for Sansotei Ramen last month because it's right next door! Despite the small restaurant size, the bright yellow interiors of Gyugyuya and welcoming scent of curry are warm and inviting. I'd say it fits about 30 people, and seems to be a quick-serve restaurant.

We arrived at about 1PM on a Wednesday and were seated immediately as there was no line (hooray!) There seemed to be a few waitresses on hand to take our order and serve the food. The menu has typical Japanese appetizers like edamame and gyoza, but heads up, you'll probably want to save your appetite for the main dish.

WE ORDERED:
- Nabeyaki Curry (which includes an egg, sausage, cheese, vegetables, and curry with rice.)  - Chicken Katsu Curry (deep fried chicken with rice, egg, and cabbage)

Our curry arrived after about 5 minutes or so? We were both super impressed about how quickly it arrived. My Nabeyaki curry was actually still bubbling and steaming so I had to wait a few minutes for it to cool down! I really enjoyed it, but I didn't think there was going to be so much cheese - the entire bed of rice was covered in cheese... (Not really a cheese fan.)

Overall, I liked this restaurant. If you're looking for a quick place to try out that's filling, delicious, and inexpensive, check out Gyugyuya!"}

{"text":"I reaaaalllllly enjoy Jap curry so I was super excited to try out this curry specialty restaurant. However I must say I was disappointed both with food and with service. As with the norm we got really polite Jap service but I don't think the waitresses had the hang of things when I was there. After taking my order (got the pork cutlet curry) I was asked what I wanted as a drink and I said water. She never came back with my water. Then my bf asked for water again (he didn't know I asked once already cause he was in the washroom) and she actually came out with a single cup of water, and actually returned later to remark at how funny that was at which point I took the opportunity to finally get some water for myself. (Sigh).

But onto the food! I was disappointed because the curry was not the golden creamy goodness I was expecting. Instead it was dark and kind of chunky I would say. When I saw it I was like, hmm, maybe the taste will blow my mind then since it looks so different. Nope. Just tasted like normal curry to me. Nothing special to differentiate it as a specialty store in my humble opinion. 

Overall not a restaurant I would go out of my way to try. Maybe out of convenience or if Sansotei next door has a line or something.

(SIDENOTE: I thought I was just ignorant and that this dark sauce must be the legit stuff but I saw a vid of this really famous curry place in Japan and they had the golden creamy sauce I'm used to. Perhaps this dark sauce is a regional thing. Someone let me know 'cause I'm curious!)"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off.... They really give minimal meat and a LOT of rice 

Disclaimer: I lived in LA before where there is an abundance of Japanese curry and also good tonkatsu 

The curry was decent. Again they were quite cheap with the portions so only some of the rice gets covered. So your plate consists of a small tonkatsu, a little rice with curry, and a lot of plain white rice 

Beef bowl is an even bigger joke. Few pieces of meat over a huge bowl of rice. And it's $10!! 

Price for 3 dishes including beef bowl was $45. I had to go get more food after cause I was so hungry since I obviously didnt eat the plain rice"}
{"text":"Being in the neighbourhood, we decided to give this place a try.  The review average is pretty accurate.  I'm giving this place 3 stars.  

My husband and I decided to get the king plate which consisted of a chicken katsu, a pork katsu, one shrimp, two sausages, and a hard boiled egg on curried rice.  This was a pretty solid portion for about $20. We agreed that the cabbage slaw should have been more plentiful considering the plate is filled with carbs and fried proteins.  How much is cabbage anyways?  Probably one of the cheapest vegetables out there."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a while back and we really enjoyed it. We initially wanted to go to Sansotei next door, but since there was a lineup, and that we both wanted to try Japanese curry, we stepped in to Gyugyuya. The first thing you'll notice is the huge logo on the wall. I dig it. I don't why. Its just real cool. The staff was friendly and courteous. The food arrived at an appropriate time as well. I tried the Katsu Curry and my bud got the platter that had everything on it! Also got some karaage on the side 'cause everyone loves karaage, right?! 

Prices were very reasonable as well and bought a souvenir coffee mug because of that damn logo I love so much!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot! My beef bowel was fantastic. Awesome flavour and soo filling! Service is fast and friendly. It's very small so there isn't much in the way of seating. Solid drink selection for very fair pricing. The pho here is also very good but my fave is the beef bowel with the option of adding egg."}
{"text":"Looked next door at Sansotei and it was full with people waiting outside. Having a short lunch break, I jumped next door to Gyugyuya and got the Gyu Curry Rice (beef). Pretty good food. I might avoid it next time though because it's so salty (so mainly just for health reasons). I might just get the plain beef rice next time.

But for 12 bucks before tax and tip might be a bit expensive.

Service was good and fast. Good for some quick lunch.

Quality 8/10. Service 8/10. Value 6.5/10. Overall: 7/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"This is some of the best curry I have found in the city. The food is always on point and the staff is friendly and courteous. My usual go to is the Guy cheese curry, but the karaage is always tasty and crisp. Their sides are a perfect compliment to the curry. Mixing in the fukuzinzuke with the curry adds a new layer of flavour to an already amazing meal. The rakkyo (pickled onions) are so juicy and delicious. 
Always a pleasure to eat here. Now, if only I knew where they got their sporks..."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place for Japanese curry. If you like Japanese curry, you can get your fill here. Actually wanted to go to Sansotei, but the wait was too long so decided to give this place a try, because of their very interesting sign. 

First we noticed when we came is is that this place was really understaffed. We were seated right away but it took a long time to get our menus, to put in our orders, to get some water, to get our cutlery... You get the point. The staff was always at the cashier area, preparing takeouts. Maybe they were having some problems. But the restaurant may have been around 60% full and everything just took very long. Otherwise the staff was nice courteous when we were able to get their attention. So this place almost exclusively serves curry, except for the chicken rice or beef rice. I think maybe I should have went with that instead, it's more safe. So of course I had to order something with curry. I decided to go with their Nabeyaki curry, it looked intererting, comes in a stone bowl. In the description, it says that there's egg, sausage, cheese and vegetables, it all sounds good. First of all, logistically, it came a lot later than my friend's regular curries, which is kind of a bummer when you are eating most of it by yourself and your friends are waiting for you. Second of all, the dish looks exactly like the picture. I can't say that they were misrepresenting, but I \"thought\" that maybe there's another piece of broccoli hidden underneath the sauce. It only comes with two pieces of broccoli and one sausauge, or parts of one. So for a normal human being, this dish barely fills you. Thirdly the sauce is so overwhelming, everything is drenched in it you cannot taste anything else. I guess it doesn't even matter if you had more ingredients, you won't be able to taste it. 

All I can say is that if you love Jap curry come here. Everyone else don't."}
{"text":"Delicious homestyle food. If ever you have friends that are dying to go to the ramen place next door and deem it ok to wait 30 minutes in the cold, convince them that GyuGyuya is the place to be. The King Curry is the best thing on the menu, large enough for 2, with two large portions of Pork/Chicken Katsu, 2 sausages, 1 tempura shrimp, 1 egg, and delicious curry on rice. They do pick-up really quickly as well."}
{"text":"soooo yummy. this was my first time trying japanese curry. ordered the chicken katsu and it was so good. also tried some of my friend's beef which was seasoned so well and was very tender. will def come back when im in the mood for curry. also, if u want to avoid a line up, go right before dinner time."}
{"text":"Being a Japanese person who eats Japanese curry almost twice weekly at home, I was hesitant to try it at a restaurant. I usually think of Japanese curry as underwhelming, compared to its Indian counterpart.

In my head, I only thought it would offer regular chicken or beef curry. Turns out they have various options such as having karaage (Japanese fried chicken), katsu, ebi-fry on top of your curry, which makes the curry a bit more exciting. I ordered the Karaage Curry (and it came with lots of karaage pieces topped on top of dark curry. There was shredded cabbage on the side with sliced pieces of boiled egg. I thought it was nice that they incorporated the cabbage and egg so that there was something different to much on when I was bored of the curry.

The generous portion of karaage was soft, but bit too salty in my opinion. Still one of the better karaages that I have tried in Toronto. The curry was rich and was more gravy-like than what comes of the standard Japanese curry boxes. Overall, not bad!

Service was not too attentive and slow, making it an OK experience."}
{"text":"Flavourful Japanese curry on top of fried chicken or pork.  Food is decent and helps curb curry cravings but nothing special that I'd go out of my way for. The curry is what you'd expect Japanese curry to taste like (strong dark taste) and the katsu was crunchy. The service was great and attentive but I found it was a bit pricy for what it is."}
{"text":"I tried the tonkatsu with curry rice. The whole entry was tasty with rich flavor curry and crispy and nicely seasoned ton katsu. I did feel a little stomach issue after eating so I'm not sure if I'm being sensitive to the curry (which I typically have no issue with). Quiet pricy for the amount of food I got though."}
{"text":"its way too salty.  and definitely not jap authentic.  had the curry.and beef bowl. both way too salty. will never come back.again"}
{"text":"The curry was drench in sauce, not something I like but the taste was excellent!!! My friends took me for my birthday lunch I had the beef and they had chicken and pork. In my opinion chicken and pork tasted very similar. The batter was thin giving a very very nice crunch to the texture!! I enjoyed eating the chicken and pork! The fatty beef was thinly slice it was ever so delicious !"}
{"text":"Went there one evening soon after they opened just out of curiosity. The dish was fairly rich and packed with a lot of curry. The portion didn't look big but was quite filling. Overall just okay, wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my partner. I ordered the Tonkatsu and he got the beef bowl. Both were extremely tasty and satisfying. Worth another visit to try their other menu options."}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Japanese curry as an (obviously Canadian) Japanese man!

I ordered the beef cheese curry along with a few other sides.  The thought of cheese in a curry was really strange but it looked so good that I had to try it!  The beef was really good but may be a bit fatty for some.  The cheese added a nice mellow element to the dish and dulled some of the spiciness.  I could have used more spice but I really enjoyed it overall.

I ordered the yakitori and chicken karage, which were both excellent!

The service was friendly and quick.  I liked that we were able to get in and out fairly quickly.

I feel like this restaurant could be cleaned up a bit.  It looks a bit worn - inside and out.

My first experience with Japanese curry was a positive one and I'm sure I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Update: still a delicious choice for Japanese fried chicken cutlet curry! I got exactly that and I noticed that their bowls changed from the last time I was here but unsure of the portion did as well as I was just as full. Curry comes out piping hot, enough to semi-cook the cabbage and thick enough to coat the rice without it being too watery. Fried chicken was delicious and the whole meal was complete with the hard boiled egg. Service is great, even during super busy rushes.

Note: they add 12% gratituity to your bill."}
{"text":"You ever go into a restaurant with high expectations, hoping that the food is amazing, and when you get there.....you're a little bit disappointed? Well, for me, this was the place. 

I had high expectations at this restaurant. Japanese curry is the only curry I really like; no other curries can compare. When I sat down and opened the menu, my first reactions was....oh, is this it? There wasn't a huge selection of foods (like what I am used to when I visit Japan). I decided to order the beef curry with cheese and rice. It was ok, but not what I would call the best. I guess I like the beef bowl more than I like the beef curry with rice. Portion sizes were ok, not too big, but no too small either. There really was nothing to this place that really stood out. I can't seem to find the words for this place other than blah....it was just bland. 

Service here was good though. Like most japanese places that I have been to in Toronto, the service here was great. 

Overall, I may go back, but i wouldn't go out of my way to visit the place."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken katsu curry and was quite disappointed when the chicken katsu was paper thin. Some parts weren't even actual meat---there were pieces of fat. 

Serving portion was disappointing for the price, but that's expected for downtown Toronto. For small eaters it's more than enough, but for bigger eaters it might not be satisfying enough. the curry-to-rice ratio is extremely bad; it's like the rice is drowning in a pool of salty curry. It was extremely difficult to finish the last half because it was basically a soup of salty curry with rice in it... 

Servers were extremely nice and attentive, though. 

I think you can definitely find better Japanese curry places around Toronto, and I wouldn't voluntarily return here unless I was starving and it was the only restaurant open."}
{"text":"Simple Japanese curry katsu dishes, but to be honest, I prefer my katsu dishes to be a particular way in terms of sauce taste & meat tenderness (the chicken katsu that I got was a bit dry, which was a turn-off) and although the food was quite decent, I would probably go somewhere else. Nice decor/interior, though! Service was pretty efficient as well."}
{"text":"Really good! Too bad we sat by the door.... Its too cold when its -30 outside. They need a divider or something. The curry is really yummy. I would come back! The chicken curry is also really good. The curry have a different taste to it. Its really nothing I have tasted before. Would recommend it."}
{"text":"Upon entrance, the restaurant felt like a Japanese style fast food restaurant.

My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken katsu + beef/gyuu (sp?) don for lunch. The chicken katsu was surprisingly crisp while the curry itself was just okay (the taste was a bit too strong for my liking). Similarly, the beef in the beef bowl had a bit too much taste. 

Overall it was just an okay meal. Decent enough for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Saturday and the restaurant was busy, but there was a table available and we were seated quickly. The service was friendly and fast. We were served our food after about 15 minutes. I had the chicken katsu curry and my sister had the tonkatsu curry. I was really pleased that the miso soup was only $0.79, compared to $2 or more at other restaurants. The chicken katsu was crispy, moist, and delicious - this was definitely the best part of the dish. I didn't like that the rice was served at the bottom of the dish with the curry and chicken katsu on top. I prefer to have rice on the side. I wasn't impressed by the taste of the curry - would have been happy with just the rice and chicken katsu. Overall, the taste of the food was just OK - I don't think I will visit again."}
{"text":"I come by here for lunch sometimes, especially if I don't feel like lining up at Sansotei. I LOVE Japanese curry. There's something about the myriad of ingredients from coffee to cheese that blends so well together. 

I usually get the karaage curry. I find the sauce soaks into the chicken beautifully. Overall, great service, great food, the place is so clean I feel I could lick the tables sometimes (not that I've ever tried). 

P.S Their sporks are super cute."}
{"text":"I don't care how true-to-curry-from-Japan other Yelpers regard their dishes, the curry is just awful; runny consistency, overall lack in flavour, and it plates horribly.  Even better, the disproportionate ratio of protein to rice makes you wonder where your $11 went!

Better to spend your money on a pack of Glico curry and a sack of rice.  (The fact that this restaurant has not yet been featured in either Torja or Nikkei Voice - Toronto based Japanese print - implies the lack of authenticity.)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day not knowing what to expect. It's a small little Japanese place with quick service. I got the chicken katsu curry with rice which was pretty good but not amazing. My brother had the gyu cheese curry which is what I wish I got. Would recommend his dish over mine. One thing I didn't like was the rice to curry ratio - the rice portion is really small compared to the ton of curry served with it. Another thing to note is that a 12% tip is already included in your bill. Not much by way of atmosphere here, but a good spot if you want something simple and quick. All in all a decent experience."}
{"text":"Walked by and was interested so came in with the family...

First...peanut free environment...good for my kids. 

No line up, prompt greeting and sat us down quickly.

Order came with salad and miso soup. The salad looked quite unappetizing...see pic...first thought was someone regurgitated the salad dressing (maybe skip the pieces of corn). Miso soup was decent but dried tofu? Maybe for the price some real pieces would be good.

Main course came in decent time. Nothing special...curry sauce seem bottle variety.
Pork was ok for deep fry...not overly dried.

Price point is a bit high for what you get but the place was busy so I must be missing something. .."}
{"text":"Great, simple Japanese curry. I had the ton Kastu curry and my friend had the gyu with cheese curry. It comes in a in dish with shredded cabbage, rice swimming in curry, sliced soft boiled, and the meat placed nicely on top (I noticed that my friends gyu dish was bigger than mine). Every component of the meal was well done and good portion sizes. 

My only complaint is that the AC was too cold and windy. The curry wasnt very hot (temperature wise) but this is probably due to the arctic conditions of the AC. 

I will be coming again for the warm comfort of Japanese curry."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick cheap lunch. I had the chicken don. Pretty good but it could have been crispier."}
{"text":"They mostly serve dishes with either meat or veggies on top of curry rice. Along with a few select side dishes that consist of pickled vegetables or additional meat toppings. Alcohol is around $5 for a Sapporo bottle.

The curry was OK. It could have been more flavourful in my opinion. As with Japanese curries, there isnt a lot of spice and it is usually very light tasting, so don't expect a very exciting culinary adventure if you're more of a spicy/traditional curry fan. Meat given was a decent amount, curry was adequately spread on the rice, but the vegetable curry lacked in veggies and had too much rice hidden under the very sparse bits of potatoes/carrots/onions.

Enjoyable meal with friends so would recommend if you are craving Japanese style curry as others enjoyed this lighter tasting meal. Service was alright, they were very polite and pleasant, but gave us an estimate of a 10 min wait when in reality we ended up having to wait 40+ mins to be seated. If we had known it would take that long, we would have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a delivery order, and after an hour the food had still not arrived so I called to ask how long it would take. They then told me that they would not be able to deliver the food, so I needed to cancel my order (they did not say why). This is completely unprofessional. If they cannot handle an order then they should at the very least call me to let me know. Thankfully I decided to call to check after only an hour."}
{"text":"Good service, good portion of food. Although the food tastes good, wayyyyyy to salty and oily."}
{"text":"Got the karage curry and the gyu. Amazing mouthfeel!! Must try when you're in the area."}
{"text":"It's an okay speedy restaurant, but personally, I feel that the menu is very salty. The beef bowl is way off the salty as if these are bacons and same as curry, 3/3 times.

Portion was small. It's a fast food menu but priced at a Isakaya.

key word: salty and smalll portion."}
{"text":"I've never had Japanese Curry before so this is an unexperienced review. However I can say I truly enjoy Japanese cuisine the best and I knew I would love it. Upon entering you're greeted by the servers who have a nice bright smile and they're more than happy to help you, the decor and seating is really clean and for some reason the yellow walls and uniforms sre comforting. I had the Tonkatsu Curry(a staple dish for sure !) And the sauce going into the rice, the salad on the side, and the cutlet itself were perfectly layed out together and the flavours are not too hearty but sweet and filling. I'm coming back here often for sure."}
{"text":"L O C A T I O N 
On the crossroads of Dundas St W and Chestnut St. This place was recommended to me by my cousin who went to Japan for a study abroad. She said that the curry here rivals Japan's! I've never had Japanese curry so I'm super excited to try this place! 
F O O D 
//Gyu Gyu King Curry// ($23.99) It came with egg (cut in half), ton katsu (pork), chicken katsu, sausages (2), shrimp (1), and curry with rice. This is a huge plate meant to be shared unless you're a food eating champion. The meat-to-breading ratio was crunchy and good. The curry had a nice slow heat to it. You'll want to drink water with your meal. This dish was simply delicious. I split this with 3 other people so it was a good snack for us since we're doing a literal food tour of Toronto.
S E R V I C E 
Staff here are friendly and our dish came out fast! Since we split our meal the server gave us small metal plate bowls.They refilled our water frequently since the curry had heat to it. 
O V E R A L L
Wow, my cousin wasn't kidding when she said this curry was good. This would be perfect on a cold snowy day. The yellow interior of this restaurant makes you feel warm and comforted. They have a decent amount of seating, but it can be a little cramped if your wearing thiiiick clothes. The bathroom is located downstairs. This dish makes me want to visit Japan to see their curry-game, but since I can't afford that luxury of quitting my life to embark on a magical journey to try authentic Japanese curry this place will do. 
* * B O N U S * *
On the receipt they include a service charge/fee!"}
{"text":"A bit of a tight space but the food is delicious and friendly staff. No matter how busy it is the staff always greet and are courteous to their customers. The food is outrageously delicious and are decent sized portions. Perfect to come with a couple of friends or even alone."}
{"text":"The tongkatsu and beef rice is very similar to japan's. Very authentic Japanese food.  Been looking for something like this forever! 

Service was good. Decor was simple but very clean. Would def come back here as it's right by my work and each dish is a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Decent prices and decent portions...a little too much sauce for my liking for the karage curry but still good nonetheless. Would come back again."}
{"text":"actually pRettY daRn good. the curry was very rich and dark, the best japanese curry i have had. although i wish they had more options"}
{"text":"Guygyuya was a pretty authentic Japanese curry house with homemade rich and flavourful curry and crispy meats. During my visit, we've ordered a curry tonkatsu and a gyu don (beef bowl with rice which comes with salad and miso soup). 

I absolutely loved the gyu don, the very very thin slices of beef was cooked with mirin amongst other, giving the meat a nice sweet taste. 

The curry tonkatsu was however, a bit too heavy for my liking. The rich and super flavourful homemade curry was paired with a freshly friend large tonkatsu. Both individually were hits but combined together and served with a heaping portion of rice, we had a hard time finish the dish. 

It would be nice to see some more vegetables and a combination of lighter ingredients with the curry, I absolutely cannot wait to try their gyu curry!"}
{"text":"I ordered Tonkatsu Curry. My compadres ordered a beef. The Tonkatsu was crispy and the curry is full of flavors. The beef was thin and tender, easily melt in your mouth. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Really really love this place. I have been here once with a friend then I started to fall in love with this restaurant. Personally I am not really a big fan of curry. However this place has made me changed my opinion. It is relative cheap consider how expensive it is to eat in downtown."}
{"text":"Beware of shady financial practices....this is a  cautionary tale for when the receipt arrives:

1 - they automatically apply gratuity of 12% to your bill regardless of party size but don't inform you that they do it, and if you pay by credit the machine again asks you for a tip amount....

2 - they also charge you the 12% tip on your subtotal and tax combined which really means you're paying 13.5% tip by default.  

Payer beware!

I suppose that's my only contention."}
{"text":"If you are craving Japanese curry, this is the place to go! It's extremely similar to GoGo Curry in NYC and have similar menus in comparison. The curry is very rich with crisp shredded cabbage + egg for the side. Now.. there are a lot of options but the tonkatsu and chicken katsu were thin and dry. Tasted slightly over-fried as well. If they were less fried and not frozen, then it would've tasted better. I try to eat this once in a while since it's super rich but other then that, a solid 3 star :)"}
{"text":"Gyudon in Japan is poorman's meal. The price here is grossly over priced esp for gyudon. And any place that serve miso soup, i expect miss soup to be at least decent esp. If it's a Japanese owned place which this resto is but to start off miss soup was subpar which was quite disappointing. Portion of gyudon was decent but almost $11.00 a bowl is borderline criminal.  In Japan where beef is x2 the price here,  same bowl of gyudon will be half the price here. I came here to relive the memories of eating yoshinoya while I was living in Japan but it was very short lived experience.  Gyudon was 7/10, service was just ok,  and value was 4/10.  What I had overpaid  for was for the authentic Japanese experience rather than for  food itself."}
{"text":"The portions and pricing are good, the quality of the food... average. Though I looove how they use a torch for the cheese, the meat was kind of tasteless and there was too much rice for my liking. One more thing that I liked about this resto, is the music they play: straaaight jams. Until Gyutaro (the resto that closed down last year, along Bloor St. West) opens up another location, I'll be coming here when I crave japanese blow torched cheese/beef bowls..."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and ordered beef curry. The curry sauce that day was so salty. My friend had the same feeling that the curry sauce was a lot saltier than usual. We tried to finish our food but couldn't. When I paid for the bill, I told the staff that the curry was salty. Unfortunately the way she responded was unacceptable. Instead of appologizing to us, she said she had no idea why the curry sauce was salty, she also said that maybe we had problem with our taste. Wow, I was so shock with what she said. I'm sure it was our last time having our meal there. Worst customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Nostalgia from Japan. Went there because we remembered how good the food was in Japan, including it's curry. Went there for lunch and we were seated immediately. 

Food itself was decent, however not as good as in Japan. I personally had the beef bowl because I was in need of proteins. The plate consisted simply of beef on top of white rice. the portion was generous enough to fill up. 

Situated on Dundas street in Downtown area, it is a good place to stop by for lunch!"}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed the fried chicken curry that I had here. However, for the price that I paid for my meal, I definitely expected there to be more of it. They serve your meal in this tiny little plate. Apart from that, I had nothing to complain about.

Side note: all of the employees spoke fluent Japanese to one another. I found that to be ridiculously cool. But maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"I don't have Japanese curry that often especially not at restaurants. However, I have to say that the curry at Gyugyuya is tasty and the portion size is satisfying. Good amount of rice, meat, egg, veges and curry. 
After a late Saturday lunch appointment we were in the area and wanted to grab a bite. We decided to get some Jap curry. There was a line up but the wait was not long as I did realize that service is quite fast. We waited about 15mins and were seated. I ordered the chicken katsu curry while the fiancée ordered the tonkatsu curry. Once we ordered, in less than 15mins we got our order. At first, I did not think the portion size was that big but once I started to dig in, it is definitely enough and satisfying. The fiancée also agreed and was full. The chicken katsu was crispy and moist- every bite was delicious! Curry was good as you know Japanese curry typically isn't super spicy and does have a sweet note. The egg was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the curry rice dish. Note that if you want the egg cooked through you may need to let the server know.

Overall, great meal but I have to say it is not something I would run back for since good Japanese curry can be made at home and is something you can find at decent Japanese restaurants. I would say if you are in the area and crave Japanese curry, hands down, go to Gyugyuya!"}
{"text":"Japanese curry is very tasty and probably best in the city. Seating is quite limited about 20 seats in total, but the service is excellent and all the staff are very friendly and super helpful. The menu photos don't look that appealing, but the taste makes up for it coupled with large portions and competitive prices. Also their meals come with plenty of rice and meat, but there's a serious lack of vegetables."}
{"text":"We wanted to get ramen but the line was too long so we settled upon this since it seemed to be filled with people.

I liked the taste of the curry. I ordered the gyudon and while the meat was nice, the bowl was more rice than anything. A bit bland and it tasted a lot better when I grabbed some of my friend's curry sauce and added it to my bowl. 

Friendly service and greeting upon arrival/departure. The walk to the bathroom is incredibly steep and the bathroom ceilings are ridiculously low for anyone over 5'8?"}
{"text":"Sansotei was too busy, so we opted for this restaurant instead. It was empty when we walked in at 3pm in the afternoon.

Ordered the gyu don (beef and rice) and for the price, the portion was very big and filling. 

My sister ordered the chicken karage. We've had better chicken karage, but for the price, nothing bad can be said. 

The service was attentive and quick. Also, the large print of the bull's head on the wall does not distract from the meal itself.

Next time I will try some of the vegetable options."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese katsu and curry!! Honestly the menu pictures look pretty drab and there is a severe lack of vegetables at this restaurant but it was the finest Japanese curry I ever had! If you get the king size special it's perfect for two people to share. Fast meal prep but slow service for water refills, the servers were too busy to get their attention but they also should have checked in with us after serving us which they didn't do. Despite this the curry was savoury, slightly sweet and just straight up slamming and I have to give this restaurant a solid 5 because it was so good I wanted to lick the plate. A+ curry"}
{"text":"Great food! Nabeyaki is my recommendation. 

But there's a catch. You have to like Man in the Mirror because they played it on repeat. Over and over again."}
{"text":"I ordered the karage curry, and while it looked amazing - it tasted just average. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing bad about my food but it just like any other japanese curry dish. Perhaps next time I'd get the tonkatsu curry because some of the karage pieces had a weird texture inside and the shape made it kinda hard to eat."}
{"text":"Great flavours and great service. Gyugyuya is the place to go if you're feeling for Japanese curry in the dundas square area. There have been other Japanese curry places popping up but the atmosphere here is well maintained and the servers always smile and attend to your needs. The beef rice bowl is a tad expensive for the amount you're getting but the curry is a must buy."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendations of a friend. I have heard about Japanese style curry before but it did not sound very appetizing. Anyways, my friend and I decided to go and ordered the tonkatsu curry and chicken tonkatsu curry respectively. While it looked mediocre, it was amazing. The waiters were very kind and greeted us as soon as we stepped into the restaurant. We went a bit past lunch time (approx. 2pm) and we were able to be seated as soon as we walked in. The food came out in less than 10min which was great because my friend and I were in a rush. 

Absolutely satisfied with my experience here and would go back again. My only concern was that the place was dimly lit. The cost for the food was also very reasonable. We both paid $14 (including gratuity) for our meal. This restaurant is located near Yonge and Dundas which makes it a great place to have a low cost meal after shopping or hanging out downtown with your friends. Would recommend this place to all my friends :)"}
{"text":"It is very affordable and a quick enjoyable meal. Get the Japanese gyu curry dish with cheese. I don't think I need to say much more."}
{"text":"I have been to Gyugyuya several times and it's always satisfied my craving for Japanese curry. I usually order the pork or chicken Katsu curry, which are both fantastic dishes. The Katsu is very crispy and always made fresh to order. It has a nice crunch to it and is very flavourful. The curry is poured over and they're very generous at Gyugyuya. There will be no shortage of curry on your rice dish.

The service is usually pretty good. However, during busy hours, your food might take a bit of time to come out, but at least it's hot and fresh. The servers are always very friendly and attentive.

If you're looking for a satisfying meal downtown with some friends, Gyugyuya is a choice that can never go wrong. I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Went to Gyugyuya last week hoping to sample a Japanese curry dish. Overall, not too bad. My wife had a pork katsu curry dish and I had Nabeyaki curry. Had to wait a while for my dish to come since they seemed to get my order wrong. By the time my dish came, my wife already fished hers. The dish itself was ok. Felt a but heavy with the baked cheese. It was a bit similar to Korean clay pot baked rice dish. The curry wasn't the best and I was really disappointing with the \"so called sausage\". For $10.49 all I got was a small hot dog fancily cut in half. It wasn't even a Japanese Sausage pictured on the menu. Might go back to try something else but wouldn't get a Nabeyaki dish again, that's for sure. For those people looking for a decent place to try Japanese curry, I would recommend Kaiju, small place in the Aura condo foodcourt. It's more an Asian fusion place rather than Japanese but I do like their version of the Japanese curry and pork/fish katsu. Will try Gyu Don at Gyugyuaya next time I think."}
{"text":"First off, the name of this restaurant is so cute. Gyugyuya! :D
Came here twice with my boyfriend and we got the:

GYU GYU KING CURRY (3.5/5)
(Egg, 1 Tonkatsu, 1 Chicken Katsu, 2 Sausages, 1 Shrimp, Curry with rice) 

This is meant for 2 people. It's more than enough! Their curry is really good, it leans towards a sweet side rather than spicy. Out of the selection of foods that come with curry, I think the shrimp is the yummiest. There are also veggies as part of the platter!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends after badminton. The interior is all bright yellow and there is a big logo of their bull. I ordered their Gyu combo. Came with an egg and some cabbage on the side. 
The beef was a bit fatty but it tasted good. Portion of food was a bit for me."}
{"text":"Such a delicious Gyu cheese curry, with tender beef, a generous amount of curry, and cheese! Their curry is very flavourful and different from your typical grocery store Japanese curry. You will definitely appreciate it if you're a fan of Japanese curry. 

The space is small, and the food is served in metal plates and cups. Definitely a more casual place for food but delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Ok the food is not terrible. But $12 for a gyudon bowl?? It's literally sliced beef over white rice. Gyudons are considered as \"fast food\" in Japan and you can usually buy them for $3-5 in convenience stores. I guess it is more exotic in Toronto and hence they can justify charging more. Their katsu curry dishes look like they are trying to copy Go Go Curry in NY."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.

Popped in for lunch and had the Tonkatsu curry on rice. Portions were a good size, service was quick, and the price was reasonable for what i got. Rice was nicely soaked with curry, just the way I like it - saucy. 

A solid all-round effort. It's not going to win any awards but it doesn't disappoint either. They met my reasonable expectations and I would definitely drop by again for a quick meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"Honestly been wanting to come here and try this place out ever since it opened. Sorry Kaiju. So finally today my girl and I headed to Gyugyuya. Absolutely satisfied with the customer service here. The place was fairly empty, hype obviously died down but the waitresses were very welcoming and gave us plenty of time to make our decision before approaching and asking gently if we're ready.

We ordered one tonkatsu curry and one chicken katsu curry with a side dish of squid tenzpura. The curries came out piping hot but not hot enough to burn the top of your mouth. A small mountain of white sticky rice is placed in their long bowls then doused in their sweet, not so sweet and slightly spicy dark brown curry sauce, julienned cabbage is placed at one end along with one egg sliced and placed on either side of the bowl and the piece de resistance the katsu is placed on top of the mountain and a ladle of katsu sauce was ladle across. The good thing was how crispy the katsu was even being smothered in two different sauces. The squid tempura was a generous portion, the squid rings were lightly deep fried and seasoned with black pepper and salt, it was served with more cabbage and Japanese mayo dipping sauce. All and all it was a very filling meal and didn't do much damage to our bank accounts. 

I will definitely come back for their curry and service :)"}
{"text":"Amazing curry tonkatsu, add on hot spring egg for true magic"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Japanese curry, look no further. Stopped by here a few weeks ago to have a quick bite with a friend. It was about dinner time on a Wednesday and there were only a few tables that were full. I ordered the chicken katsu curry and my friend ordered the pork katsu curry. Some had said the the curry does not have flavor, I feel that the flavor is more subtle. I do wish that it came with a touch more heat. The chicken was juicy and tender and fit really well with the curry and rice. I find anytime you have curry, rice is a must - to soak up all the sauce! The service was quick and attentive. I also liked how you could get sides to compliment you meal. For those who can not tolerate any spice, this might come in handy."}
{"text":"Three stars is probably about right for this place. My disappointment was that I came looking for curry, which features prominently in the advertising. My bowl was pretty much just rice and fried chicken.

That being said, the food was hot and it came out fairly quickly. This is not a bad option if the line next door at Sansotei is too long."}
{"text":"Portions are on the smaller side - probably not enough for a hungry diner. Ordered the cheese on beef curry. The curry was too sweet for my liking and didn't really taste the cheese. The beef was pretty standard - no complaint there. The salad/lettuce thing that they served on the side was tasteless and kinda reminded me of paper...

For the price they charge, the amount of the food served did not seem equivalent. Wouldn't hurt to try once but I'm not sure I'll return here."}
{"text":"Breaded and deep-fried meat covered in curry sauce. What could be better than that? Not a whole lot. The curry's got the right amount of heat to announce itself w/o getting in the way. Crispy deep fried pork and chicken are both tasty and altogether it's a filling, inexpensive meal. 

Service is friendly and efficient. Too bad they don't have free toppings on days that have a 5 in them like Go! Go!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this on our way to AGO. And this totally hit the spot on a cold winter night. It's a small restaurant and usually there is a short wait...but it is worth it! Their Japanese curry is so delicious and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I used to work around the area and randomly found this place while I was looking for a quick stop for lunch one day. I visited a few months ago on a weekday around 12:30 PM and it was quite full. I got seated at one of the sole bar stools at the back and was given a menu promptly, while the server rattled off their more popular dishes. 

As others have mentioned, your food comes very quick! This place was very efficient, which I really appreciated! I ordered the deep fried chicken with a fried egg and rice, and it came out in less than 10 minutes. The chicken was crispy and delicious, but I found the rice to be a bit bland (very plain and minimal seasoning). Overall, this isn't a bad deal for lunch, particularly if you're in a hurry. 

I didn't order a drink so with tax and tip, my total came to a little less than $12.00. Decent value, particularly taking into account the portion size."}
{"text":"I like the food and I like the location of this restaurant. It's pretty close to the Eaton centre = large mall and subway. 

The food was good too, I got the beef bowl and the fried chicken. Beef bowl was flavourful, tender, and has a decent amount of meat. Chicken was just alright though, they didn't really marinate the inside, so the flavour only came from the salt and pepper they the sprinkle on top. They give you a side of shredded lettuces just to get some vegetables.  

The environment is really loud though and you kinda had to scream in order to hear each other. Seating is limited and I feel coming with a group of over 4 people would be pretty difficult to sit down and then have a conversation in this loud environment. 

Service was great, however sometimes it was a bit difficult to understand the girls' Japanese accent. Not a big issue though.

Their spork is pretty funny. Cute ;)"}
{"text":"Nice spot for Japanese curry. Fans of the long-closed Gyutaro now find a home here. 

I usually get the Karaage Chicken with curry because it's really, really delicious, and the fried texture goes well with the curry. The curry beef with cheese is also flavourful, and you get an extra kick out of the cheese too (it neutralizes an otherwise strong curry taste). The beef is tender and delicious in all the right places. Most (if not all) of the entrees come with shredded cabbage, a soft egg, and steaming rice. As someone else has mentioned, there's a good balance among all the portions.

Gyugyuya remains a fast, fun, and filling meal. The sauces could leave you feeling a little thirsty, though, and the curry dishes can all start to taste the same after awhile. However, this is a Japanese curry place, so what else would one expect?"}
{"text":"From now on, I will always keep this place in mind as the standard of japanese curry. 

I decided to give the \"Gyu curry\" a try. There were more than enough curry to soak up the rice, egg, veggies and beef into perfect harmony. The curry I had was sweet, salty but also had a kick of spice at the end , even though some may argue it's a little spicy for them. To me - it's MILD and it was perfect ! The dish was a SOLID winner for me! Wohooo! 

Side note: I love how you can customize your dish by adding more toppings (for additional price )  

The only big NO NO was our bill, they automatically charged us 12% tips (party of 2). Nowhere on the menu or any server informed us about this charge. NOT a huge fan of that. I have no problem paying 12% but don't be sneaky about it :/ I know some people don't even look at the receipt, so they probably gave extra tips. 

The service was only okay. I wouldn't give more than 12%. The only good thing about the service was they gave us more water without asking. However, I felt like they only refilled our water so we wouldn't bother them. Moreover, we felt very rushed during our meal. The waitress continuously asked if we were ready to order which cleary we weren't.  :( 

Final Verdict : 3.5/5  I'll definitely revisit this place for the FOOD, and hopefully the service will be better."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years but never the less still tastes as good as I remember. I ordered a curry katsu for take out. 

I really enjoy their curry more than most places that serve up japanese curry. The dark curry has a stronger aromatic scent and the taste is a slightly more zesty compared to some other places that serve japanese curry. This place is very similar to Go Go Curry in NYC, if anyone has ever been. 

They serve up almost identical portions, same plating and same quality curry katsu dishes at this place. One similar dish is the Gyu Gyu King Curry which is similar to the World Champion Curry at Go Go. The NY version they give you a bit more meat and it's significantly much larger portion (5.5 lbs) compared to the Canadian version. The katsu is quite crunchy and not overly fried either.

Pretty good place imo to get authentic dark japanese curry that is similar to what you may get in Japan."}
{"text":"The curry is okay, but 12$ for the portion is not worth it. The dish consists mostly of rice, and they tend to be cheap on the meat. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge japanese curry fan so I thought this place would make me a true believer. Gyugyuya definitely helped the cause, but I don't think I'm dying to have it again (like some people in my life).

Staff: Friendly and helpful. Some are not as fluent in English but they are definitely trying their hardest and I always appreciate that. Our waters were constantly filled, and our food came quick.

Ambience: It's very yellow. You can't miss the yellow. The yellow happened. (It was also a bit noisy, does that help?).

Food: I had the Chicken Katsu Curry and Deep Fried Shrimp on the side. The shrimp and chicken are nice, however I found the curry to be pretty thick and overly salty. It was definitely filling though.

I'm curious enough to come and it try it again."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

This place reminds me of Yoshinoya down in the states and in Asia. Since there's no Yoshinoya in Canada, Gyugyuya is probably the closest you'll get in Downtown Toronto. 

The menu is very simple, with only about 10 dishes to choose. I had the gyu cheese curry, as I wanted to add cheese to my dish. They were quite fast in preparing my dish, as I received my food in about 5 minutes.

Overall, it was okay. The curry was typical Japanese style, sweet but not spicy. The beef when mixed was also quite good, and the cheese melted decently with the food. For $12.99, however, I did find it a bit on the expensive side, although the quantity was quite heavy for the food.

The A/C wasn't working too well when I dined here a couple of weeks ago, so that probably needs fixing. It also might explain why there weren't too many people dining here, as I found the place to be quite empty.

Service was very good, as we were attended to the whole way. The seats were a little uncomfortable, but you're in and out of this restaurant in under 30 minutes so it shouldn't be an issue.

I'm not a huge don person, but if you're sick of the Japanese sushi/ramen joints, this place is a good substitute."}
{"text":"We were planning to check out another nearby restaurant, but they were closed. I paid for two hours at the parking meter and was starving so we decided to grab lunch at Gyugyuya instead. When you walk in, all you see is y e l l o w; it can be a little overwhelming. The menu specializes in curry and according to their menu, it's curry from Kanazawa (not familiar with this type of Japanese curry). I had the chicken katsu curry; for $10-12, you get a pretty good portion. Along with the katsu, there was cabbage and a halved boiled egg on my plate. The curry was not that good though. It was way too thick and I felt that I was eating curry paste; the sauce is supposed to be a, well , sauce so maybe more water was needed. For my Japanese curry fix in Toronto, you'll find me either at my own kitchen making it or somewhere like Green Tea Cafe.

Good for: curry, lunch"}
{"text":"I would have never stepped foot into this place if it weren't for having Japanese curry in Tokyo at Go Go Curry. This is the Toronto alternative and it's pretty good. The curry is slightly different, perhaps a bit saltier, but still good. The servers were friendly. We (two people) tried the Gyu Gyu King Curry (the giant platter) and we still had to pack our leftovers. There was a lot of food. The only sucky part is having to pay for the fukujinzuke (pickles)...it's like asking me to pay for relish when I order a hot dog."}
{"text":"Small Japanese restaurant serving mainly curry dishes. Lots of seats available here - albeit a tight squeeze though! 

Ordered the: 
- Nabeyaki curry: Curry, cheese, sausage, and broccoli. It was wayyy too salty. Midway through your meal, your mouth will be dying of thirst. The cheese melted on top was nice for the first couple of bites, but by the end it made the dish too heavy to finish. The sausage was also hella dry, way too overcooked.
- Katsu curry: Fresh katsu on top of curry and rice! Served with some shredded cabbage on the side - it's nice to cut the grease and saltiness with! 

Price here is reasonable though! And service is quick and efficient. 

Overall, I would just stick with the simple curry dishes. Skip the nabeyaki curry unless you love love LOVE salt."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean but food is meh and quite pricy for curry, my chicken katsu was $11.99
Small menu btw

Honestly I found the curry to be a bit too heavy, rich and sweet, Katsu was nothing special, was still hungry after finishing mine

Girlfriend ordered the veggie and sausage curry which had only 2 broccoli and half a hot dog.......pathetic

Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Great affordable restaurant downtown for a casual meal. The food is not presented nicely but it tastes a lot better than it looks. I ordered the Gyu cheese curry which has rice, egg, cheese curry and beef. The combination of the cheese curry and beef tasted great...almost like a cheese burger! I really enjoyed the meal and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyudon and tonkatsu curry for dinner at the restaurant. The Gyudon and tonkatsu curry was delicious; the pork in the tonkatsu curry was juicy and thick cut. The egg was also perfectly cooked and there was a lot of sauce, which is great. I also added the cheese side order, which was 1.99. The gyudon was flavourful, but I wish there was more beef. Overall, the dishes were good; I just found it a bit pricey for the quantity of the food."}
{"text":"Japanese curry and katsu place on Dundas. Portions look small but it is super filling. Nice little joint in the middle of the city. Will be coming back again when I crave Japanese curry!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ton katsu curry and it was delicious!!!!  The curry was rich and very flavourful.  The service was good and they advised that added an automatic 13% tip even though there were only 3 of us, but it was okay.  We were nearby and randomly went in.  Me and 1 of my friends were initially disappinted that there were no rolls and that the clientele were really young so we thought it going to suck and be the traditional Chinese or Korean run Japanese establishments that are just okay, but were pleasantly impressed that the server at least was Japanese and that the food was exceptional.  Portion was okay but I could have used a bit more.  My other friend ordered yakitori and he said it was good."}
{"text":"3.5
I really like how their curry taste different. It has more of a kick than usual Japanese curry and an almost meaty gravy flavour. You can tell its not the stock cubes you get at most places.
That aside, there's definitely room for improvement for their dishes. Great curry, horrible curry to rice ratio. The amount of rice they give you is so little compared to the curry sauce, it could might as well be called curry soup...
I got the chicken katsu, chicken was thin and on the dry side. My sister's gyu cheese curry however was bomb. The cheese and gyu mixture really transformed the curry favour and gave it an extra level of depth and flavour. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick meal. The gyu curry is the best. U can get curry and gyu all at once"}
{"text":"I go here when I'm craving Japanese food (not sushi) and I like the food but the portions are small for what you're paying for. It almost cost 10 dollars for rice and a bit of beef on top with some onions. I only go because it's close but Manpuku which is close by at Village by the Grange is cheaper and serves similar dishes."}
{"text":"I went downstairs to the washroom (if u are 6 feet or over u gotta watch ur head cuz i hit it on the ceiling twice lol). When i got back from the washroom my food was on my table. I have NEVER received food that fast in my life...even at Pho or fast food places. The restaurant is pretty authentically Japanese and if ur a fan of their curry u will enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is satisfying. Service is remarkably quick during the lunch hour, but don't expect anyone to top up your water unless you ask.

I ordered the gyu cheese curry. The gyu is thinly cut, but the cuts aren't very clean. They probably expect that you won't notice by the time you mix it with the curry rice and cheese. The extra $1 cost of the gyu cheese curry over the regular gyu curry gets you a large mound of cheese, well worth it if you like cheese in your dishes. I didn't leave hungry, compared to the earlier reviews - and the person beside me couldn't even finish off their \"Gyu Gyu King Curry ($20.99)\"

I think that it's pricey ($12.99) for what it is - beef curry with cheese on rice, but of course a good part of the cost goes toward its downtown location and staff. But maybe if you're after a normal katsu curry, you're better off going for Kaiju in the Aura Food Court at Yonge/Gerrard. 

They take credit cards, including Android Pay."}
{"text":"The food was good and decently priced. I ordered the chicken katsu don, my cousin gyu cheese curry and another cousin ordered the karage curry. Every curry comes with salad and a hard boiled egg. I think for the portion and price, the gyu cheese curry was the best option. It is larger than the other plates and only about a dollar more. The curry is good with just a little bit of kick and it reminds me of Kaiju's curry. I felt that even with the salad and miso soup my meal (katsu don) was a much smaller portion. It was not a problem for me however, if you are really hungry, I would recommend just getting the curry as you get a better bang for your buck. The chicken itself was good and crispy, not oily at all. However, the bowl was filled to the brim with rice. Way too much rice. 

I will definitely be back here for curry next time!"}
{"text":"I would come for the food if this is something I was craving. The beef plates and chicken karaage are all tasty. But is expensive for what it is as well as the quantity. The service is friendly when you're able to get their attention."}
{"text":"Been to Gyugyuya a few times now for lunch when I've craved Katsu. Service here is always prompt, and the portions are more than enough for me personally. I definitely missed out trying Curry when I was in Japan recently, but I'd like to think Gyugyuya is close to what they'd be like, if not better.

I usually get the chicken katsu when I come by, and usually get my dish within 10 minutes. It's definitely on the salty side - not sure what causes it... maybe the sauce - so make sure you have that water handy. There's definitely more rice to meat ratio but it is what it is. It's a nice place every now and then, but would not be my number one choice for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is another go to place for me and my co-workers. They absolutely love eating this curry. I always order the Katsu Curry (deep fried pork chops). It comes with a big piece of pork which is very crispy and underneath is a bed of rice with curry on it. On the side of the dish is an egg split into slices. My coworkers love ordering the cheese curry, but every time I've tasted their curry, I had a hard time tasting the cheese. 

The staff are really nice, but the service is kind of slow. The price of the meal is a tad on the pricier side.

Recommendation: if your coming here for lunch time and only have an hour for lunch, make sure you come for 11:30am because once it gets to 12-12:15ish, it gets extremely busy and you most likely will have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It's small but cozy, and the portions were filling and big on flavour. It was my first time trying Japanese curry and I wasn't disappointed at all. We went for the Gyu Gyu King Curry, which is a great size for two and lets you try both the pork and chicken katsus. The tempura batter is one of the lightest I've ever had, not oily at all and super delicious. The King Curry meal also comes with a single tempura shrimp, so two people might have fight over who gets the little guy. The curry can get a little heavy towards the end, but I still couldn't stop eating it! Next time I'll try asking for the curry to served on the side rather than the default of over rice. Such a great meal on a cold winter day - definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one day as I have heard many good things! The place is small, and line ups are not unusual. I got the gyudon for $10.89+tax, and it was delicious. However, I found there was not enough meat, and way too much rice for the asking price! By the time I finished the meat, there was still quite a bit of rice at the bottom. This disappointed me...especially since gyudon is generally a type of fast food dish that is supposed to be cheap/affordable. Besides this, servers were nice and courteous."}
{"text":"i really like their sporks and the yellow interior. The staff are really friendly and smiles a lot! 

i think they give a bit too much curry sauce with their rice, so I always ask for sauce on the side. They don't have a big menu so I always know what to order hahahaha also i love that you could add cheese or whatever to the curry! 

Overall this place is great if you have rice craving"}
{"text":"This place is a great inexpensive option to have hearty Japanese comfort food. Gyugyuya serves different variations of curry rice with beef, katsu, sausage, vegetables, eggs, shrimp tempura and cheese. The curry served here is deeper in color than most other places and tastes richer as well. I've been here 5-6 times by now and it is my go-to spot if I'm hungry back when I went to school in downtown Toronto. For the student budget the serving size of the food here leaves me very full and satisfied. The cheese melted overtop delicious curry and meat always hits the spot for me. The saltiness does build up as I finish my bowl/ plate each time though, so be prepared to drink lots of fluids during and after your meal."}
{"text":"Japanese food with curry is what this small place is about. I had the beef bowl which was beef with a slight curry pop in a bowl sitting on rice. It was delicious and filling. The service was awesome, though the seating was a bit tight. If you're in Toronto be sure to stop by this place, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"When the line up is too long at Sansotei, why not try Japanese curry at Gyugyuya?

I had their katsu don and it was pretty good. Nothing that blew my mind and I never had other authentic Japanese curry so I can't really compare. Portions were large though.

Wasn't busy when my group of 3 got there but will come back maybe!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this restaurant after reading about it on Blog.to (http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/gyugyuya-toronto) and so I dragged my co-worker to it today for lunch.  We were running short of time so we had to get take-out.   We were pleased that the server was very friendly, as was the kitchen staff and the service was fast.  

This was my first experience with Japanese Curry.  I ordered by Guy Cheese Curry while my friend had the Chicken Katsu Curry.  I loved the sauce - it was very rich and flavorful.  However, I found the meat and cheese mixture just \"ok\".  I was also disappointed with the fact that most of the dish consisted of rice.  It absorbed all of the sauce and was very tasty but I find that much rice too heavy for me.  I also felt that $12.99 plus tax for this dish was much too pricey.  I did not enjoy the hard boiled egg with the yolk not quite cooked through enough for my liking (I am not sure if this is the way it is supposed to be cooked with Japanese Curry restaurants).  My friend's chicken was deep fried and tasted fine but I found it rather bland if eaten without the sauce.  

I really wanted to love this place, especially since they were so friendly to us.  However, I cannot see myself rushing back to this restaurant with all of the culinary options in the surrounding neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very yellow, literally. This is a good lunch option in the area, the portions may be a bit small for dinner though."}
{"text":"Y'know that instant curry that you can buy in an Asian supermarket? Yah.. I'd opt for that instead.

I ordered T o n  K a t s u  C u r r y and the pork cutlet itself was done perfectly! Just enough batter, crunch, and thickness. Also, it was very juicy and portions were very big for a person. It was really weird though since it came with this nasty coleslaw salad i was like wtf. 

However. However. Howev...-er. the curry itself was really disappointing! Like, it was bitter and not any curry I've tasted before. Like I said, I would have rather had instant curry.Oh, and one more thing, they have really crappy side dishes. All of it looked very unappealing.

Overall: You'll find me at T&T buying some Glico curry!"}
{"text":"3.5* 
I tried this spot on a random night with a friend who lives nearby and we had a pretty decent experience overall. 

We found the service to be very attentive, though I should add that they weren't too busy during our visit. The food came out quite quickly, in fact faster than any fast food joint I've visited in recent months, making us question how exactly the food was prepared with such speed. 

I found the karaage curry portion generous and the taste was satisfactory as well. The traditional beef bowl (not sure of the name) came with a side of miso and shredded cabbage. The bowl itself was a bit short on meat, but the taste was more balanced and less salty than the curry option. 

Overall, a good quick meal if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Having just returned from a trip to Japan my boyfriend and I were delighted to see a dedicated Japanese curry restaurant opening in our neighborhood. In fact, the design and pictures made it look a lot like our favorite curry we tried in Tokyo: Go Go Curry. We made sure to pay it a visit as soon as we had a chance!

We ordered their Gyu Beef Cheese Curry and Tonkatsu Curry.

Gyu Beef Cheese Curry: pretty good! The cheese adds a dimension to the taste that's unexpected but not unwelcome. It's grated on top and then maybe charred in the oven so there's a bit of melting and a slightly deeper flavour from the charring. The beef is tender and works well with the sauce, rice and cheese.

Tonkatsu Curry: the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) was cooked well and juicy. The rice was a bit overcooked for my taste, and the curry sauce had a nice flavour and a bit of heat from the cracked black pepper.

Overall, having expected something as good as Go Go Curry we were a bit disappointed. The sauce was lacking in flavour in comparison. 

Still, seeing as it's pretty much the only Japanese Curry place downtown and the service is excellent and friendly, we'd go back if we had a craving!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch one day and tried the following:

Chicken katsu curry: the curry is good and the chicken was tasty.

Gyu beef curry: the beef and curry had a good flavour. 

It's a nice, laid back lunch. Didn't have any issues with service. Food and service good overall."}
{"text":"When we walked in, the staff greeted us in a Japanese greeting, which made us feel welcomed! The menu is simple with a few items to choose from, so I ordered the chicken karage curry with my friend and the wait staff immediately brought us two plates to share. The food came within minutes and we were excited to dive in! The portion would be good for any adult with an average appetite, but for someone who enjoys bigger meals, this would not be enough. The chicken itself was fried too much, which took away from the flavour. The curry had a good kick to it, so for someone who can't eat spicy, this was a pleasant surprise. I do wish they included some potatoes or carrots to the curry - it's just a sauce. On the side, there is some shredded white turnip (not sure at all if that is what it is), but it didn't accompany the curry well in my opinion. It was dry and not refreshing at all. The egg was split in half and sliced, which was a cute detail. I liked that the utensils included were chopsticks and a spork. Their water service throughout the night was consistent.

All in all, the food was about average, but the service and attention to detail made it a good experience - I would like to try this place again."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, greeted by the staff team right when we entered and left. I feel like even though it's a restaurant, people go in and out very quickly (very fast paced). My sister order the chicken katsu and I got the kaarage curry and wow. Both dishes were so good! They came out hot and steamy, the meats were so crispy and flavorful! Oh, the curry itself was sweet but not too sweet and it was not spicy at all. I'm surprised it took me so long to decide to come here despite eating around in this area for such a long time. I will for sure come back to eat their curry again."}
{"text":"Came here on opening day as weve been watching this place get built. I work across the street. We were actually the 2nd people to come in. They had a great 50% off promotion for today and the first 150 get a gift! (spoiler altert**** its a mug)

I wasnt sure what to order so asked for a suggestion. It was recommended to try the beef curry with cheese. I thought, jee thats a weird combination...curry and cheese....erm...ok? My coworker ordered chicken katsu with curry. The cheese dish was definately alot bigger. He enjoyed the katsu dish...i was quite shocked at how much i enjoyed mine. The cheese really gave the dish a unique flavor combination and an addictive quality. I was stuffed. We had tea - service was really sweet and friendly. It did take a whiel to get our food but it was understood that openign day, (and it got very busy) it would be a bit slower as theyre gettign their groove. 

Also note - its not huge in here... so if you plan to dine in...take thta into consideration. There was a lineup already formed by 11:30 today... 

I will definately come back to try the shaved beef curry bowl. I wish these guys alot of success! 

Also - not licensed yet it appears. Only water/tea/juice/soda"}
{"text":"I don't know what authentic Japanese curry tastes like, but whatever they're serving here is soooo good. You can't go wrong with the chicken katsu or tonkatsu curry which is fried to a crisp and laid on top of a bed of rice, curry sauce, shredded cabbage and a hard boiled egg. The curry has a tiny bit of a kick and tastes a lot different than what you normally associate curry with - sweeter and less pungent. Don't judge the portion because although it's small, it's definitely filling."}
{"text":"So very overpriced. Should be max a $8 meal but charging $13? And tips are automatically included? I'm shocked that it's somewhat busy at all hours when there are so many other good cheap eats in the area. Would never go again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fun, friendly atmosphere. The beef is light, full of flavour, the cheese has a nice grilled taste. Price is around $11 but the servings are well portioned."}
{"text":"I got the curry tonkatsu. Honestly, it wasn't anything special. The tonkatsu was tasty, but it tasted like tonkatsu from any other sushi shop that I've been to. They could be a bit more generous with the curry too. I actually thought Kaiju's food court curry is better but Kaiju is probably the best in Toronto. That said, the service was friendly and efficient, and the portions were pretty large. They also include some cabbage and some boiled egg along with meal, which is nice."}
{"text":"I LOVE Japanese curry. I have been watching this restaurant being built and anticipating its opening. What a disappointment! It is probably the worst Japanese curry I ever had. How can a single focus restaurant mess up its feature dish so badly??? I guess I will have to continue cooking from \"my \"Japanese Soul Cooking\" cookbook and other reliable sources to get my curry fix...."}
{"text":"they started charging 12% service surcharge which I had no idea I would be paying. I left no tip, sorry. the soggy rice and defrosted coleslaw wasn't worth $16.5"}
{"text":"Good food, quite unique. The servers actually speak Japanese so that makes the food and kitchen more authentic. 

I got the gyu curry and others tried the chicken katsu. Tasted decent with curry soaked rice, reasonable price. 

Recommend going as parties of 2-4, not a big space and big groups (we had 6) will have to wait a while."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service sucks. The waitress screwed our orders a lot and they never confirmed our order. They didn't refill our water or offered us water when we came in. Very disappointing since I come here regularly. I feel compelled to give this bad review so that they would improve their service."}
{"text":"Their curry has a very strong BBQ sauce taste.  Not my preference, but not bad. I'd take Coco curry over it any day though. Katsu was decent, a bit dry...
Gyudon was $11+tax which is fucking crazy, its just white rice with a few slices of beef on top."}
{"text":"overall, it's good and I would definitely come back for it again, I had the gyu curry beef and i finished it, lol normally I couldn't finish a whole rice bowl, but I did!!! I might try to curry cheese next time! It's close to ryerson so it's very convenient for me."}
