{"text":"My fist time visiting El Charro aka Viva Mexico. It was a quiet Thursday evening. My Server Sam was warm and friendly. The atmosphere was colorful and festive. I sat at the bar to watch soccer. I was amazed that their chips & salsa and margaritas were so addictive. The food was very, very good. I could not eat it all and had left overs for lunch the next day and the food was still taste delicious and fresh. The price is moderate, knowing that they make their food from fresh from scratch, it is well worth the dollar. I will be putting Viva Mexico in my food budget!!!"}
{"text":"A small Mexican restaurant, the good was just Ok.  It was a bit bland and mushy at times.  Service wasn't good the one time we went, however the prices were agreeable and I'd likely go again since there aren't a lot of closer Mexican restaurants around me.  With just a little more care about the food and service, it could be a really nice place.  Unfortunately right now, it's just so-so.  I'd go again though."}
