{"text":"This has to be the worst pizza place in Brampton don't waste your money. It has no taste they over charged me just straight up gross."}
{"text":"This is my first visit and we really enjoyed the pizza and wings here.  We ordered the XL Hawaiian and 20 wings and paid about $30.  Both were great but we enjoyed the wings more.  This is a good family restaurant but my only concern is kids working there - not as professional as I would like.  But the food is good."}
{"text":"One of the better pizzas we have tried in Brampton. Try the hot chili feast special pizza...spicy and satisfying! They are generous with their toppings too."}
