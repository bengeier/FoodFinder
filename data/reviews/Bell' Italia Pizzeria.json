{"text":"Pepperoni pizza and spaghetti with meatballs. Both excellent. Looking forward to my next order."}
{"text":"I gotta say I am floored at the number of positive reviews.  Went there for dinner on a recommendation and were really let down.  The spaghetti and meatballs were less than average, the sauce was watery and lacked flavor. The meatballs tasted as if they were frozen. The sausage in my opinion was very good, we were informed that its ground fresh daily  that was a hit.  The pizza crust lacked flavor but was crunchy.  The service and the sausage were the real winners tonight"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this restaurant. It has a lovely Italian atmosphere from the window paintings to the music. My family and I love love love this place, their pizza is absolute perfection in every last bite. When you meet the staff you will instantly be welcomed with kindness. My family has been coming to Belle Italia since it opened and we are such good friends with them they are like our family. The rest of the menu is something that you will never forget. One word: SANGRIA. Absolutely delicious this is so good!"}
{"text":"I wanted to really love this place and would have to say our overall meal was good. The service and cannoli were outstanding. We started with the calamari and had a huge pizza half meatball and half cheese (for my son). They were both good but the sauce was not my favorite it's thick and sweet, too sweet for my taste. The dough was awesome thin and crispy just like back east and the meatballs were solid. I will go back and try some non red sauce based pizza/pasta dishes. Prices are fair, the staff is awesome, it blows away any chain and it's owned by a local. I will be back for sure but there are a few other places around here I would like to try before I settle on a local go to pizza/italian spot."}
{"text":"Drink the sangria!

I absolutely love this little hole-in-the-wall place. Mario cooks and his sons are the waiters. Amazingly friendly family-like atmosphere! The food is delicious and fresh. We even had them cater our after-wedding party. Can't recommend it enough!

Gets VERY crowded so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Best gluten free Italian bar none!  Love their gluten free pizza and all of the options for pasta (I usually get a pasta or entree and a pizza--eat a couple slices with dinner and take the rest of the pizza for the next day). They are one of the only places that I know of that does GF Marsala and parmigiana (and it is fantastic). Didn't get it tonight since it was late and the entrees/pasta are a bit heavier. This is one of my favorite places to eat in the entire valley. Great family Italian. Not a ton of tables but I've never had to wait long for a table but I imagine it depends on day and time.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Bell Italia has ruined me. Their pizza is so flippin good, I no longer enjoy pizza elsewhere. The staff is wonderful, fast, and friendly. I end up eating here weekly, and convincing friends to try it out."}
{"text":"Really good italian food!! You won't be wowed by the ambiance but who cares! I ate every last bite. Simple menu, great service and big portions! Side salad had good green lettuce and my gnocchi with vodka sauce was flavorful and delicious! Fair prices too. I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's exactly what you want from a true neighborhood family-owned restaurant. The pizza is some of the best around, and the pasta is extremely reasonable in price."}
{"text":"We've found a nice family owned Italian restaurant with GREAT food.  Pasta nights on Monday or Tuesday are a great deal.  All of our dishes were perfect, seasoned well and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this quaint restaurant several years ago and couldn't remember why we'd not been back..,,,,read on my friends.  Let me say first and foremost, the staff were very friendly and courteous.  They were quite helpful, and attentive.  The cook even came out and spoke with us for a little bit.  My wife ordered the gluten free bread, which really was like a small pizza, without the sauce.  It's gluten free so I won't say much about the flavor or texture, but not very good.  She ordered the pasta with vodka sauce, took one bite and couldn't eat it.  I tried it and honestly something was off.  It had a kind of wang to it that I couldn't identify.  The waiter came by and asked if she liked it (she clearly was finished) and she paused trying to be polite...I quickly stated \"no, it's not good at all\".  He quickly said I'll box it up for you, no offer to bring something else....just a box to bring it home.  I tried the linguini and clams with white sauce.... I'd say just ok.  Small portion, the baby clams I think we're canned, and when all was said and done, each entree was $18.00 each, add the bread a glass of wine and a iced tea, and were out over $50.00 plus tip.  Back to the box.... my 15 year old boy who would eat a shoe wouldn't eat the pasta. Now I remember why we hadn't been back."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly, \"neighborhood\" restaurant. One of my favorites for delicious Italian food.  Five stars, for sure, within its format/category."}
{"text":"Good pizza and OK pasta but the small family style Italian restaurant is unpretentiously charming.  The pizza dough craft they let the kids do is very creative and fun.  It was very nice of them to bake the dough that the kids made so they can eat the creation.  The servers were also sincere.  It's a memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. There is nothing bad to say about the place, but if I could ask for one thing it would be bigger tvs so you can see the score of whatever game is on. We had the calamari and garlic cheese bread as an appetizer, dinner salad that I think comes with every entree, I had a dish  that I can't remember the name of but it was a thin chicken breast with potatoes and sausage in a sauce that was great. I also had penne with vodka sauce on the side, the vodka sauce is probably the best I've ever had. Wife had butternut squash ravioli, mother in law had spaghetti with meatballs, and father in law had lasagna. Everyone loved everything. We also ordered cheesecake, cannoli, and tiramisu which were all awesome. Service is great. Go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. The staff was very friendly and made sure our first experience at the restaurant was a great one! My husband and i agreed that the atmosphere was wonderful. We had pizza and salad which we both enjoyed. Our son was given dough and a cookie cutter to play with, which helped out a ton.He loved his pizza too. The waiter even cut our son's pizza slice into small pieces since he is only 20 months old (said he had two kids and wanted to save us the hassle). Will definitely be back to support a \"family-owned\" restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Could not ask for better service! They are all so friendly and we love going in there. 

Must try: 
Hot Wings- amazing! 
Homemade Sangria
Stuffed Shells 
Butternut Squash Ravioli
Pizza- you can get a single slice any way you want!! 

Great atmosphere for families! We recommend it all the time!"}
{"text":"I just finished a delicious eggplant Parmesan sandwich and tossed salad from here.  And they're independently owned, on the way home from work, and take Discover.  Yes!  I can't wait to try their pizza.  Hopefully, it won't disappoint because this may become my weekly take-out place."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that make you feel like family as soon as you come in.  Family that serves the best Sangria I've ever tasted (and I've had many glasses to sample) and delicious desserts.

The clam pizza is unique and fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food most of the time. Pizza has been burned several time. I was ask do I want to wait for a new one or take the burnt . I didn't want to wait think g the will give a discount I was charged full price. Anythinh do no use your credit cards there pay cash. I used my card there twice and was charged 50.00 for a pizza. I got my money back after two weeks of going back and forth."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Always a delicious experience! The staff is amazing, the food is excellent and sangria is so, so good! Finish off with a limoncello or, even better, expresso-cello and your dining experience is complete!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bell' Italia several times and have never had a bad experience.   The food is excellent and the staff is very nice. There butternut squash with the vodka sauce is delicious.  I have also had pizza & chicken parmesan.  Oh yes, I have become a limoncello connoisseur, and there's is very smooth and tasty, I would have had two, but I was driving. :)"}
{"text":"I just tried the Sicilian pie yesterday, and I am doing a back flip. It is as close to home (Brooklyn) that you will ever find here in Phoenix. It is only a 12 slice pie rather than the the traditional 16 slice pie, but the crust is amazing. I found myself a real NY pizzeria, and I am doing a happy dance. I have mad love for this place."}
{"text":"Have heard alot about this place and finally took my son there for dinner last week.
First, the pizza was GOOD! Should have made it for take out - more on that later.
Place feels like a revamped nail salon. No ambiance what so ever. Cramped seating and very noisy. Service was OK, beverages were average. Iced tea was not brewed - powdered or RTD. 
Would recommend trying the pizza, but make it sure it is take out. Allows you to really enjoy the food. Eating at the establishment really takes away from it.
I do not have a hang up on the ambiance needing to be top shelf, it's just that when it is apparent that no effort was made to make the place feel like a restaurant, why eat there."}
{"text":"I have to do an updated review for this restaurant!! It is STILL my favorite!! And I eat out a lot. It is about 20 min from my house, but I never mind making the drive.The food is fantastic! Mario is THE BEST!! And Adi takes such wonderful care of all of their customers!! You really feel special when you are there. They catered my 50th birthday party and did a fantastic job! All of my guests raved about their food! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!"}
{"text":"Been there many times as well as some of their by invitation dinners and have been very happy and satisfied every time.  My favorite pizza which is hard to find as a New Yorker.  Recommend without a doubt and the owners are always friendly.  One of Ahwatukee's hidden gems."}
{"text":"I just ate the best slice of pizza since I am living in Arizona.  I also had the eggplant parmigiana the other night. Simply said Il meglio, the best."}
{"text":"Our favorite family restaurant. We love Mario and the staff. Have been going there for 7 years!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian. Cute little gem hidden behind Dunkin Donuts. Owners are wonderful! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Looking for an italian place that wouldn't be too far from the Gila River Casino where I was going to take in a show.  Didn't want to eat at their food court.  (Even though I really like the PHO at their Ginger Star food court stand).  No.  I wanted a sit down dinner with really good italian food. After all, it was Saturday night.  I gave them a call before I headed out.  These days you never know who has gone out of business the day before. Things are just that volatile in the restaurant business.  They answered and I asked if I needed reservations.  The man said, to be safe, reserve.  OK, reservations for two it is.  
When we got there all the tables were empty minus two.  There was one with an acrylic sign on it that read \"RESERVED\" at one of the tables.  Before I could open my mouth to tell them that I had reservations, a young lady pointed to a table in the back corner and brusquely told us to \"sit there\".  The table with the \"RESERVED\"sign on it was a better situated table, but I didn't want any conflict so I sat where I was told to sit. 
We were served a mix of olive oil, herbs and balsamic vinegar with some fresh bread by yet another server.  A tall, young, attractive african american woman who seemed to glide as she walked. Very graceful.  The bread was fresh enough but nothing to get excited about. Reminded me of hot dogs rolls split in half, but they were not.  The dipping sauce was not very tasty and as usual I added a few flecks of salt to amp up the flavors.  Needed something, but as I was here to eat and not to cook, I didn't bother trying to figure out what was lacking.  I got it!!!  A few fresh garlic cloves and some freshly chopped basil would have done it!   
We ordered the Chicken Marsala & Chicken Piccata which came with a salad and a side of pasta for $17 each.  The internet indicated the price as $16 but we all know it takes time to update a website so we accepted the up charge.  The salad was iceberg lettuce, a few pieces of tomato, two black olives, two slivers of red cabbage, two slivers of carrots and mozzarella cheese.  It was ok for what it was-- a side salad.  Hubby kept counting the ingredients in it as he had visions of the salad I make him nightly one hour before his dinner.  It has many, many ingredients: mixed greens,  Kale, red cabbage, broccoli crowns, radishes, walnuts, grape tomatoes, red onion, cranberries-- sometimes feta cheese or blue cheese depending ..in a tangerine or apple cider vinegar vinaigrette . They are indeed hearty, healthy delicious salads.  I think he is spoiled to the core, don't you?  So what I was thinking as he counted the ingredients?  \"Shut up, you're not home.  Eat it and smile\".  
Our entrees arrived, one marsala, one piccata.  Each has two slices of chicken breast in their respective sauces.  The slices were very, very, very thin.  I would say that they were about 1/4 in thickness.  No kidding. No fooling.  Both dishes had sliced mushrooms on them.  Mine had two pieces of artichokes (I think from a can) and a minor sprinkling of mini-capers.  I could have done without the artichokes--added nothing to the dish.  I could have used more capers.  I love capers.  I think that's why I order the dish.  I like the lemony, caperish taste on the meat and sauce.  The sauce was not lemony enough or \"caperish\" enough.  And the sauce was runny--on both dishes.  Hubby's marsala was just ok.  Not enough of that Marsala wine taste.  
After eating 3/4 of one MY \"weight watchers sized\" cutlets, I passed my entire plate for hubby to finish.  After all, it was in my best interest.  If he didn't eat beyond what was on his plate, I would have to cook when I got home after the show.  He would never force me to, but after he starts rummaging through the fridge you know I feel guilty enough to make him at least an omelette--a smoked salmon omelette.  That's one of his favorites.  Getting back to the rest of the meal--
So after giving away my chicken to \"the other side\",  I concentrated on eating the side of pasta I was given.  Angel hair with marinara sauce; he had the ziti with the sauce.  The sauce was OK, but was nothing special.  Average.   Yes, I ate it.  Had to.  Nothing left for me to eat.  What was interesting was that hubby had asked for the sauce on his ziti to be FRA DIAVOLO.  It is a spicy marinara sauce.  So the waiter had said to this request, \"No problem.\"  I was so impressed that he knew about this sauce that I said to him, \"Do you know that some restaurants don't know what FRA DIAVOLO sauce is ?\" He smiled and said, \"We know.\"  So low and behold (what exactly does low and behold mean? Does anyone know?) his FRA DIAVOLO SAUCE was nothing more than the sauce I got, but with red pepper flakes on it!  Like the flakes you put on your pizza!  Wow, what a let down. 
Service by the waiter- very welcoming, cordial and polite.  Clean restaurant, good intentions, but below average food."}
{"text":"Everything is home made, the pizza is phenomenal, & the ambiance is perfect for a date night or even a random night out. If you're looking for a hole in the wall Italian joint then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews from Yelp and Tripadvisor. Not a fan. Basically, this is mall food court quality stuff. Absolutely not 4 stars. Definitely not 3 stars. Pomo, Gratzi, Pizzeria Bianco - those are 4 star places. Food here was bland."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the baked ziti and I had the chicken piccata both delicious our server gave us a sample of the cannoli... Best I've ever had  I highly recommend this charming little restaurant"}
{"text":"The Shrimp portofino is so so/ate there 3 nights in 1!week and owner gave me 25% off card- brought it in to use on order and he did not apply it- charged full price! Stick to the lasagne- pizza is not really thin crust! Sangria is good! Probably will not recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried for first time yesterday and food was outstanding!  Short hours but well worth it - Sangria was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Great family run Italian food! Chicken Francese was tender and tangy. Butternut Squash Ravioli was fabulous. The cannoli is to die for. Service was great, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal from this little 30 person bistro. Great authentic ny pizza and pastas. Nothing fancy, but all high quality!  The service is always stellar, too"}
{"text":"Easily the best vodka sauce in all of Phoenix. The service is wonderful and attentive. Adi and Kylie are always my favorite people to see when I go into the restaurant. Kylie is such a bubbly and fun waitress that really just adds to the enjoyable experience. I really recommend this place if you're looking for a good authentic Italian meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and pizza. Love the calzones as they were very good (filled with feta) and not dripping grease as I've had on others.  Only a small complaint on the salad which had some browned lettuce but overall a good place we will frequent again."}
{"text":"The service was excellent everyone was very friendly.  The food was solid, the drinks were excellent.  One in our party has severe food allergies and they were very accommodating.  We'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"BAD!!!

I have had great Italian fare from NY to New Jersey. Also being Italian growing up with homemade Italian food from sauce, to pizza to canolis. From a Italian who knows the food this place is no good, it's not homemade it tastes worse than Olive Garden, and I hate OG and their fake Italian crap.. The noodles are obliviously not homemade. the sauce bland.you throw down nearly 30 bucks for crappy commercialized Italian? I think the only thing I enjoyed half way was the salad, but who can mess up a salad? 
I seen plenty of the older crowd here, I think this is the only thing that keeps this place going.

Bell' Italia - You get two thumbs down from me - I'm not coming back"}
{"text":"Mario makes great food. We always feel welcome and relaxed here. Salads have Mozzarella chz, cucumber, croutons and onion. House Italian dressing is great. I love the veal franchese (a light lemon white wine sauce on lightly battered veal-they also gave it in a chicken version). I also love the stuffed shells. My son loves the linguini in white clam sauce and my daughter the chicken Alfredo. My husband likes the sangria and veal Milanese and veal piccata. It is hard to find a place to get veal for under $30 without having to get all dressed up and drop a lot of money. Drinks are affordable, service great and the veal entrees come with salad and a pasta side which leave enough for an entire meal of leftovers. I like that there bread is soft and doesn't have a crispy crust. We ash for olive oil to dip it in and parm chz. We have not yet tried the pizza because we love e everything else do much. It looks like they serve it on a special pedestal platter with bumps on the bottom so the crust stays crispy. I always feel welcome, leave happy and feel appreciated for supporting a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Just  ordered a margherita pizza, large salad and large cannoli.  My husband and I could not finish anything. The service was not that friendly. The pizza was terrible, had tons of sauce and the cheese was not  melted entirely. The salad came in two different containers, super small but paid for a large. The cannoli had tons of the filling so it was way too sweet, might as well just call it something else as it was just covered and swimming in a white NON RICOTTA sweet  cream.  We really wanted to find a nice pizza place close to home but for now we are going to stick to Spinattos. It's sad that we haven't found a great pizza in Ahwatukee yet. We are never coming back to this location, nothing really was worth the money. I'm very sorry for the bad review but I wish I had not spend my money there tonight as I'm writing this review still hungry and with a bad taste in my mouth. :( I really wonder if the other reviews are real...."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Cannoli was excellent. Small venue so not a lot of seating. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! My family and I go here all the time. They treat us like family. Adi, Bree, and Carrie are all so awesome and the good is always incredible! Try the sangria--best I've ever had. This place knows Italian food--never had a bad dish and I've tried almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"We couldn't be more disappointed in the food. Ordered a large Hawaiian to-go, was told ready in 25 minutes, arrived to pick up 19 minutes later, home in 5. Pizza was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for some time. When we called to inform of our first time experience- presumed we were speaking to the owner - and he offered nothing but ridiculous excuses such as the air conditioning in the car must be too cold or that the ingredients that we ordered have a tendency to get cold faster than others. Really? We've eaten pizzas from Boston to L.A....this is one of the worst. To top it off, the establishment smells of rotten eggs. 
To the Owner: We would've considered giving your establishment a second try but the way you handled this tonight eliminates that from becoming a reality."}
{"text":"I recently had a friend bring my wife and me here. At first the restaurant seemed a bit small, but not uncomfortable.

After eating here I thoroughly recommend trying this place. The service was excellent and the food was outstanding! I certainly wasn't expecting it to be that good, but I am sure glad I tried the place."}
{"text":"This is a small family restaurant. I suggest you call and get a reservation. My friend and I dined here on Friday night. We arrived around 6pm and there was a larger party seated and most tables were used. We knew there would be a wait, but we put our name on the waiting list and waited. Since it was nice out we sat outside on benches provided. Eventually we were seated and an amazing meal began. For my beverage I had San Pellegrino and my friend had water with lemon. We were driving. We began with Bruscetta (served on the house for our patience while we waited). Oh you must have the Bruschetta, so fresh with lovely flavors bursting in your mouth. Next our salads arrived, which were created from perfectly chilled crispy romaine with yummy fresh mozzarella on top. Perfection!  I ordered linguini and clams, and my friend had Scarparello. The meal arrived and we could not stop eating. So good. Since my friend did not know what a cannoli was to enlighten her to a culinary heaven we topped off our meal with the mini cannoli, They were perfect, not too sweet and not too rich. All staff and owners are very nice and eager for you to have a great dining experience. This is on my top restaurants list. Mangiare!"}
{"text":"Best ny style pizza in the metro. Also, love the weekly specials. I recommend the pizza, pasta, and all the dishes. Best Italian experience in town"}
{"text":"We stumbled here by accident with a large party of ten and couldn't be happier with the amazing service and delicious food! The seating area is small but we fit comfortably and didn't feel like we were in the way. My kids powered through the adult size spaghetti and meatballs, the baked ziti was to die for, and my boyfriend's calzone was stuffed with cheese and the marinara tasted incredibly fresh. It's a bit of a drive for us, but we'll be back! (Or maybe we'll join the many regulars we saw picking up take-out!)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Ahwatukee! Family owned. Great service."}
{"text":"I have heard several people talk about the good food here and the great prices. It wasn't bad food or prices. It is in a location with easy parking just off of the freeway. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. It is clean and humble."}
{"text":"Have been eating Mario's pizza for the past 14 years!  And he takes care of the catering when I have a party at my house, Love all of their yummy italian dishes...my fav is the eggplant parm..
I have used Mario for catering several times, and it's the same great taste every time!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. A little pizzeria, a bit pricey but well worth the money. Great selection for gluten free eaters."}
{"text":"One of my favorite traditional (more NY style) Italian food here in AZ.  A total joint just like a mom and pop pizza place in NY.  My son's absolutely favorite place.  Service always very good.

Get the baked Ziti... Creamy, smooth and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent place; friendly, family run and great fast service. It's a quaint little restaurant that makes it feel very comfy and homey. 

I have only had the pizza twice, and it is very delicious! Fresh, thin crust, and not overly greasy. Price is very competitive."}
{"text":"So this is the last of a handful of times that I've ordered for pick up and/or eat at the restaurant.
 
1. If you are a cheese lover this is your spot.  They LOAD everything with way too much cheese.  My hubby ordered baked ziti ($16) and the cheese was over whelming, barely even tasted the gravy. You do get a side salad with entrée or pasta order.  
2. Pizza is mediocre.  I'm from Chicago (southside Italian), this isn't Chicago thin. It's a very bland pizza and extremely over priced.  If you order meat and veggies you will get 5% meat and 95% veggies. and at $2.00 a pop for extras unless you buy one of their over prices \"specialty\" pizzas, like WOW. I was expecting a loaded pizza.  
3. Side order meatballs around $4 were not worth it, flavorless and bathing in gravy that also had no flavor,  they very well could have been frozen and not homemade. 
4. Wings- $12 for 12 so should have been meatier but they were scrawny, sweet but heavy vinegar aroma and nice heat though. wouldn't order them again. 
5. fried zucchini were $10 - they were pretty good liked that they didn't even give the option of ranch and served with a red sauce.  


All in all I won't be a returning customer.  They are extremely overpriced for what they serve. The flavors are lacking and just not worth the $$$ your going to spend for pasta and pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza at Bell Italia is truly fantastic. The crust, a part of pizza that I dont normally even eat, is sooo good. It's crispy and crackery and has a really delicious taste. Ditto the sauce, which is bright and fresh and full of herbs. The hubs and I order an XL margarita pizza from here every week.

... But that's all we order. We tried the pasta, which the menu claims is all made in-house, but I call BS on that. Im pretty sure I've bought the exact same brand of gnocchi this restaurant uses at my local Safeway.

The pasta dishes may be duds, but the pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to visiting this neighborhood family owned little joint.  

First time I have tried Gluten Free Pizza and it was GOOD.  Thin, crispy crust was flavorful. Picked my own fresh toppings and a very nice sauce.  Not too sweet, not too tomatoey, not too much, not too little.  

Tried a bite of my kids cannoli and it also hit the right note - not too sweet but not too bland.  I hate to be a Goldilocks but everything was Just Right!  We'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"I'm a super fan!
SUPER!

I really, really dug this place.

It's super teeny inside.
Family run.
The pizzas are sooooooooooo delicious.  Thin crust, not greasy, delicious baked bread, oil to dip

MMMMMMMMMMMMM

I love this place's pizza and can't wait to try the entrees and sandwiches that they have!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian eatery. It's called a pizzeria, but they offer some other very delicious offerings as well.

The pizza is just how I like it: thin! I prefer true NY style pizza (the kind you have to fold in half to eat), and while this isn't exactly that, it's pretty darn good! The pizza is perfectly balanced: just the right amount of sauce and cheese to dough ratio. And the flavor of the crust is pretty good too. I usually just stick with Pepperoni, but it's good pepperoni, so I'd assume the other toppings are also quality.

I've also tried the Spaghetti, Chicken Parmesan, Garlic Bread, Salads, etc. I must say that the food here is quite good. I've always been well satisfied. And the marinara sauce is very tasty. The entrees are not cheap...well, not that they're expensive either. It's about the same price as an upscale Italian restaurant--only Bell'italia doesn't have the same level of ambiance and service as one. Whatever. It's good food nonetheless.

This is my local pizzeria. Great food. Friendly owners. I'm definitely a fan. Go here! It's even worth a bit of a drive if you don't live in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant for pizza and pasta dishes. the service is awesome with friendly family taking care of you. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The other day I was looking for a place to have a quick lunch.  I just started working in this area and Italian sounded good for a way to finish off the week.

I stopped in here and was quite impressed.  The restaurant has a homey atmosphere and the tables were mostly filled.

I sat down and the waiter told me the specials - pizza slices for $2.00 (add $0.50 per topping) and small salads for $2.00.  I forgot the other details, but it did not matter at the time.

I got two slices of anchovy pizza and a Caesar salad.  The pizza was done perfectly and was not drowning in anchovies.  The pizza is done in the true Roman variety - well balanced with regular crust, lots of cheese and zesty sauce.  The salad was simply done to perfection.

The two waiters (yes two) that waited on me were polite, attentive and had a sense of humour.

The bill came out to about $10.00.

Guess where I will be next week........?"}
{"text":"Good food, good people, good prices.  Seemed like a popular neighborhood restaurant, lots of regulars greeted with a smile or by name.

Food was a little salty for my taste, but it was still decent quality and large portions. Plenty of options and no trouble with customizing.

The staff were terrific.  They clearly knew what they were doing, and always went a step above - bringing dough for the kids the roll out, refilling your glass before it's empty, chatting up customers.

The decor features old family photos of the owner's Italian heritage.Great touch."}
{"text":"Average food at above average prices. They weigh their \"quaintness\" too high. 
The Chicken Marsala didn't look very appetizing although the flavor was okay. It needed a little color to the pale sauce! 
The marinara sauce was above average so stick to the pasta with marinara - to go. It's too warm and too cozy for most people's comfort level. 
Desserts look amazing and the sangria was delicious. 
Maybe next time.."}
{"text":"This is a cute family owned restaurant. Small inside but the food is SO good! We had eggplant rollatini, stuffed shells, salads and pizza. So good it's definitely an east coasters dream place. Eggplant was tender and not overly breaded. Shells were cooked to perfection! Pizza was thin and tasty. We've been coming here for years and love the people who work there. A definite stop for east coast Italians!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat. This family owned Italian restaurant is where you want to go for true Italian cooking and not just pizza. Went here last evening with another couple and I can report that all four meals were fabulous. The food was served at a perfect temperature, all meals were flavorful and I didn't feel overly stuffed. The salad and soup you can chose to accompany your meal were equally fresh and flavorful. Our server was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and not the least bit overbearing. We shall return to try other dishes and their pizza as well. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat; the food has an authentic Italian taste. A con of Bell' Italia Pizzeria, however, is the location of the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Very good prices, decent pizza and Italian.  Would try again."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. 

I just took my girlfriend out to dinner and we came here. We shared a pitch of Santeria and had a nice meal at a cozy restaurant. Friendly service that made sure we were taken care of but we never felt unwelcome. We stayed for for over a hour. Drank, talked, ate and held hands. 

Perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Good people great food. They will make you anything your craving.

{"text":"Absolutely the best family owned Italian restaurants in Ahwatukee.  Mario &  Paula are wonderful & accommodating hosts.  The menu is extensive."}
{"text":"Decent food & a full menu--not just pizza.  Unfortunately, it tastes like they use regular city tap water to make the sauce, which kind of kills the flavor--a big minus for an Italian place.

Small, family-owned and friendly service.  I like."}
{"text":"This gem has been at this location in Ahwatukee for 11 years (next to Va  Bene). I can't believe I only just now found it! Being Italian, I'm pretty picky about my Italian food and this place is so good and is reasonably priced! At the outset though, I had my doubts because their bread is a really poor excuse for Italian bread. It's soft and not anything like the crusty Italian bread I'm used to. Normally this does not bode well for the quality of the food. However...

Lasagna and eggplant parm were very good (don't think I'll ever find any as good as mama's or my own). Salad with house Italian dressing was quite good (no wilted lettuce as another reviewer experienced). Trio pizza (ricotta, tomato, basil) and clam pizza were excellent! Never had clam pizza before. It was garlicky and wonderful. They also made me a red clam sauce version. It was good too, but not as garlicky as the white. Also had pasta with broccoli and sausage... Excellent. Only thing is that the clam pizza and pasta were a bit oily for my liking. Next time I'll ask them to cut back on the oil.

They make their own Sangria and oh my! Love it!! Nice and fruity, not too sweet and not too dry. Finally, I had the cannoli--hands down the best cannoli I've had in a LONG time.  

The other thing I love about this place is that it's family-owned and you can tell they love what they do. All were so warm and friendly. I went for my birthday dinner with my husband and they really made it special. But get this... they didn't even know it was my birthday! I had finished my sangria and thinking about how I'd love another when the waiter came over and asked if I wanted what was left in the carafe, which turned out to be a full glass. Then when he brought the check he served us a cannoli on the house! When I thanked my hubby for telling them it was my bday, he said he hadn't! 

Definitely returning often... Especially for the special pricing on their pasta dishes on Mondays and Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I love Bella Italia.  There pasta dishes are delicious and the pizza is good.  The business has a very intimate setting.  Gets crowded on the weekend so I would do take out then.  They have a wonderful balsamic dressing for their house salad which I recommend.  Save room for dessert because you are going to want one of their cannoli's too!  I like that this establishment is family owned!  Support your locals!"}
{"text":"It's been two years since my last review of Mario's neighborhood gem. We love the food and the service...and feel like family here. 
Yes, we're regulars--every member of our family has 2-3 \"go to\" menu items here.
My wife has three food intolerances which can make ordering tricky. Mario and his entire staff handle her needs with grace and aplomb. 
This place is a gem. I can't say enough!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is first class from start to finish. Locally owned by a family, they remember your name and want to do whatever it takes to please.  DO NOT pass on the sangria..it's amazing!  Their pizza has a fantastic crust and ingredients are fresh and plentiful.  The chicken dish with mushrooms, capers and the light butter sauce was to die for.  I have had many pasta dishes and have never been let down.  Their cannoli's are the only area that needs improvement.  
Ask for some of their homemade expresso cello and lemon cello...fantastic!"}
{"text":"not many places I would say I love to visit, this is one of them. Small, family owned, great pizza- my favorite. I can take my wife on a date before a show or the whole family for some slices before shopping or hanging out. Stick with the pizza, some of the other entrees are ok, but the pizza is the best."}
{"text":"This is a great mom n pop ran Italian restaurant, our server, can't remember his name (which is sad), was excellent! He knew the menu in and out and even suggested substituting certain meats to try \"something different.\" My husband and I had the lasagna and it was delicious, and huge portions! The price was excellent too! The restaurant is small itself, but its kept clean and organized. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This family owned business is truly a gem in my neighborhood. I enjoy going and will continue to go as long as they keep serving up great food, sincere hospitality and genuine craftsmanship in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here as a date for his birthday. We were very surprised at how small it was! The decor was cute and the tables were pretty close together but we liked the homey and family feel of the restaurant. We did have a reservation and I would recommend getting one if you plan on eating there in a high volume time. As it was we still had to wait a few minutes but our waiter was very attentive and helpful. 

We started with just the bread. It honestly wasn't anything special but it was good and we really enjoyed the seasoning and balsamic that came with it. We couldn't decide whether we wanted pasta or pizza so we settled on sharing both pasta and pizza. The waiter suggested that we try to the bolognese pasta and that came out first. The sauce was so tasty and the pasta with the cheese inside was cooked so perfectly. It was really awesome. 

When the pizza came out we were a little weary because it didn't look like anything special but we were so wrong! It was sooooo good. We got whole pepperoni and half sausage and half black olives. The pizza was hands down the best thing we have had in this city. We recommend it to anyone who enjoys pizza. My boyfriend was especially happy because his family is Italian so he is very picky about what Italian food he likes and he LOVED this food. The prices were well worth the food and not too expensive. GREAT for a date night! 

We live in Scottsdale but we will definitely be making the trip to Chandler to eat here every once in a while....with a reservation of course :)."}
{"text":"Recommend by my customers the night before.  So we went.  Don't let the small dining area fool you.  This place houses amazing scratch made Italian food.  The bread was soooo fresh and oil & vinegar dipping was delish!  Veal parmigiana, tortellini bolognese, and veal piccata were all amazing.  Had a pitcher of home made sangria...so good but different.  Not like anything I had before.  Dessert was a shot of their lemonchiello drink.  So good.  Like a creamy bite of lemon meringue pie with a kick.  We will be back.  Yuuuummmmm"}
{"text":"All I have to say is the BEST Italian food in Ahwatukee hands down! I feel like a part of their family the way they take care of me every time, literally. 
I'm a east coast Philadelphian snob, especially when it comes to Italian, and Bell'Italia Pizzeria is without a doubt the best around. Thanks for everything and see y'all again very soon!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked that this place doesn't have more 5 star reviews!  They really go so above and beyond!  The food is exceptional with tons of delicious choices on the menu, and the service is so warm and friendly.  A very nice Italian family that knows what they're doing:)  Also, this place is in no way overpriced!  I always feel like they are losing money off of me!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try because of all the great reviews but sadly a little disappointed. Service was really great but unfortunately the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I would actually like to give this place 4 1/2 if possible.

I love italian food and really I could rate about 100 places from NJ but I havent been there in so long things may have changed and some of my favs might not even be there.

The fam who owns this place is from Connecticut  I do believe.  Real nice people with sincere italian accents.

There pizza reminds me alot of east coast pizza and is probably the closet to what I remember for alot of pie in NJ.  It is really damm good. 

The best thing I have had here however...  is the Veal Parm Panini. I think they bake the bread there and the Veal is definitely all done on site.  My mouth is watering thinking about the place right now. As a matter of fact... Im ordering now!"}
{"text":"Highly reccomend.  My first time here.  My fathers neighbor reccomended it to us.  Had the lasagna,  calamari,  house salad, house wine, and bread.  Everything is excellent!"}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner last night at Bell' Italia.  

Loved, loved this authentic family owned neighborhood restaurant.  The menu is extensive, from pizza to soups, salads, pastas and other interesting main dishes.  The house Cabernet was perfect and all the food is prepared on the premises.  

Our waiter, Matteo, was terrific:  attentive, friendly and fun without being intrusive. And the food,  without exception, was absolutely delicious. 

The chicken Francese was the table favorite, but each of us truly enjoyed the other  entrees.  We're definitely going back.

PS-the lemoncello (not sure of the spelling) was a delicious way to end the meal.  It's also made on the premises."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and this is the closet pizzeria/Italian place to where I live. The staff is great and the pizza was excellent. This will definitely be a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant with love and great food. 
I love their pizza and chicken piccata. The scarparella  is a favorite as well. Monday night is pasta night. 
Mario is a friendly caring owner.  The place is intimate. 
Strip mall yes but so worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Oh my heck!!! Everything is fresh and made from scratch. I ordered some cannoli squared and gonna try them out! If I were a mobster I would bring my mafia here....wait.....I just did! Try the homemade sangria! Wow!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place small hole in the wall with authentic food. I had stuff shells. No complaints. I like the sauce. Some places have acidy sauce. This had good flavor. And I always love coke not Pepsi with my Italian food. My only negative was I didn't love the bread. But I appreciate that is was fresh. Other places in the area don't seem to feel the need to serve fresh bread. Sometimes I think it's the weather but then this place seemed to be able to serve fresh bread. I will try to post a picture of the shells"}
{"text":"I enjoy pasta night (Monday and, I believe, Tuesdays) when they have half-priced pasta dishes.  I've had the pizza and I'm not a huge fan of it but it isn't bad.  It is a very small restaurant so don't be surprised if you need to wait for a table.  On my last visit I learned you can bring your own wine for a ridiculously low corkage fee so take advantage of that if you go!"}
{"text":"I quite enjoy the atmosphere of this mom and pop shop. The waiters are friendly and serve attentively and the music is pleasant to listen to. Pasta nights are nice because you can get most of the pastas for under $10. You can add a salad for $2 more and it is worth it. I love the dressing it comes with. It is a tart flavor with olive oil over it and a bit of cheese. The initial meal starts with their bread which is usually warm and fresh out of the oven. It comes with a vinegarette that is just divine. The broccoli and pasta dish was quite light and did not make me feel bloated like most Italian places. I liked the veal combo as well where it came with a side of pasta and your choice of sauce. I think the veal was well done and thinly sliced to retain the perfect texture. The pasta on the side was a bit overcooked but not to the point of mushiness so it was negligible. I had a cannoli and it was pretty good. The sweetness was not too overwhelming and there was a balance of crisp to cream and chocolate sauce. The meal here seemed very light and balanced and the place is cozy."}
{"text":"This place blows. The service is slow and grumpy. The pizza is thin and chewy and WAY OVERPRICED.

The rest of the menu is small portions and, again, WAY OVERPRICED.

Nothing special tasting about anything served here either. Most of it tastes like Stouffers Frozen Food.

My Italian Gramma wouldve hit these guys in the head with a meatball. If any real Italian restaurants opened in the area, this place would sink like a brick. Just like the brick they put in my stomach."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Very tasty Italian food, friendly service and good prices. Lots of choices.

Don't hesitate, definitely worth 5 starts."}
{"text":"6/16/10

2.5 stars.

Mom and I came here for an early dinner.  Service was slow, even though it seemed we arrived before the rush.  No worries, though- the staff members seem like nice people and eager to please.  Tried the red sangria, and found it OK.  I'll stick to a nice red or white next time.  The salad was just OK, too-- too heavy on the grated string cheese for my taste, and the table bread wasn't warm and crusty, but our server was happy to get more toasted just for us.  I found the lasagna to be tasty and its texture delightful, though I did find the entree size a bit too small for the price ($13.95, with a salad).  I had to hold myself back so that Mom could have some, too.  After all, she did choose the entree :)  Not-so-minor complaint: some of the pasta weren't cooked through-- a few pieces were still powdery-white and hard.  Mom didn't care for the dish at all.  We both liked the pizza-- white w/ spinach.  The crust was a little too doughy for me, but good enough at the moment.

Wouldn't mind coming back for another try at the menu...

{"text":"My wife and I used these folks to cater our wedding last night, The service and food was 5 stars.  Hands down. The owner was constantly walking the dining area to make sure everyone had everything they needed. We ordered chicken parm and penne as the entre, our guests constantly complimented us on how good the food was. I couldn't be more pleased with this place. I would recommend them a thousand times over. Get the canolies!"}
{"text":"Small family owned place.  Lovely atmosphere. Great food.  Pizza and fresh sangria are worth the visit!  I have had the calzones too, which are a generous size and delicious.  Our family visits regularly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best ! Awesome authentic food and cozy atmosphere. The server Matt (handsome Italian fellow) is our favorite, ask for him if you go you won't be disappointed! Highly recommended the pizza of course or chicken Marsala ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the entire package.  Great food and even better service.  I"}
{"text":"Really great spot! I really enjoyed the white pizza I added tomato on top. The customer service was awesome. This place is been open for a while however I have no idea. Definitely coming back, can't wait to try the pasta..."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food, ravioli with vodka sauce was amazing!  Megan was on top of everything and did a great job!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out a couple days ago as it's right down the street from my house and I was not disappointed. The staff was extremely friendly, especially Mario, who I am assuming is the owner. It is a very welcoming family owned restaurant.

I only had pizza on this visit, but will definitely be back to try the various pasta options. The pizza was cooked just right and the crust was quite tasty. The only thing I would improve on this delicious pizza is the sauce. I believe it could use just a bit more flavor. 

Be back soon to try out the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"My family really enjoys this family owned restaurant! When we first moved here from Illinois, we called to order a pizza. We had no idea they didn't deliver, but the OWNER drove the pizza to our house. What a great way to be welcomed to Ahwatukee! From then on, we order and pick up our pizza, pasta, etc..
And they don't just have superior customer service, but they have the best FOOD!!! Their restaurant has a relaxed, family atmosphere that makes you want to pull up a chair and catch up."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great!!  Delicious everything starting with the bread they bring to the table. Pizza was fab! Our server, Megan, was awesome! We are from out of state and she was very welcoming and friendly. Would go here again and again!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a place tho get some good Fettucini Alfredo, and they definitely delivered.  Good food and great server.  Nice little mom and pop place."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome that we have eaten here three times in the three days we've been here. Even ordering the large pizza to take to the track. The service is impeccable and made us feel so much at home even though we were visiting from out of state. They accommodated our party of 8 and comped us garlic cheese rolls as a thank you for waiting for them to set up the tables.

Great family-owned joint and they even treated us like old friends, greeting us warmly and giving us their recipe for their delicious limoncello."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sicilian pizza supreme.  It was very bland with nearly no sauce.   Had the large house salad such was underwhelming.  Was told my pickup order would be ready in 30 min. My friend waited another 30 min.   Overall bad experience.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I hate to give bad reviews to nice people. However in this case I must, if I am to tell the truth. 

About a month ago my fiancé and I stopped by Bell Italia simply because we love good pizza and this place had a great review on Yelp. 

Let me tell you a little about myself, I am over a half century old and I'm a New York transplant (1993), I have tried some of the best pizza and Italian food in the United States and there have been times in my life were all I ate for weeks was pizza and Italian food. So I have eaten a lot of Pizza. 

Yes I am Fat, but I'm working on losing it. 

We were really looking forward to finding another place that we could go to and get some good pizza. 

Sorry Bell Italia you didn't step up to the plate in several ways. 

We each ordered a salad, now I understand that salads are in some cases are made beforehand and placed in the refrigerator. This is apparently what they do here at Bell Italia. The unfortunate part is that some of the lettuce in my salad was brown and wilted. Too much time between making the salad and service. 

I hate when I pay for something that is wilted. 

Now on the extreme cool and good tip, these folks cater to you like no others. They are friendly and very attentive and I would give them 5 stars in this category alone. 

Now back to the bread and the pizza. While eating my slightly wilted salad I also tried some of the Italian bread that they give us. I noticed that there was something a little funky (not quite right) about the flavor of the bread. First, I like crusty Italian bread, this bread was soft. But again it was mostly the flavor that disappointed; I just can't put my finger on it. In any case they must make the dough in house and use the same dough for the pizza, because the pizza had the same off flavor. It was a big pizza (24in) so we took home what was left and I tried it the next day, same funky flavor. 

Let me say this bothered me so much and I liked the reception these folks gave us so much that I literally went on the internet to find out how to make Italian bread. Furthermore, I visited several other pizza places in town and tasted their pizza again to compare the difference and there is something definitely off with the dough at Bell Italia. 

I truly hope that the people at Bell Italia take the time to see what they can do to improve on the dough. They are great people and I want them to continue to succeed in the face of additional competition. 

In conclusion, I WILL give them another chance however next time I will try their entrees, but please make sure my salad is not brown or wilted and my Italian bread tastes great and is crusty. I wouldn't suggest Bell Italia to anyone at this point. I will take the bullet for you. Look for my future review on the bread and entrees. I hope it's a good one."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good!!!  It is super huge and well worth the price!  I loved the Formaggio pizza, it was SUPER good!!  If I lived in Phoenix, I would definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but the experience was so bad I was obligated to write one. It's our first time eating here but you can be sure we will never ever come again. The service was terrible. There were 8 of us celebrating a birthday and the experience was the worst we ever had. By the way, the food ain't that great either. The waitress never checked on us the whole entire time we were there. Our drinks were never refilled. Asked for more bread and every time her excuse is that the bread is still in the oven or it's too hot to slice. Bread never came until we ask like after the 10th time. She even had the balls to automatic charged us 18% tips just because it's a party of 6 or more. No wonder she didn't care if the service was good or bad cause she gets a tip regardless. When I told her she didn't deserve the tip at all cause she sucked, she just said ok. To be honest, this restaurant don't even deserve a star. My boyfriend and I love and appreciate good food so when we say the food ain't good, it's not. This restaurant was not our choice. We were invited to celebrate a family member's birthday. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Take your business somewhere else that serve better food and have better customer service."}
{"text":"I want to give this place about 3.5 stars... it's a small but family owned Italian place.. we ordered a pepperoni pizza and a baked ziti... both were good but to be honest nothin stood out about any of the dishes...we felt like the flavor of their sauce in both dishes were very basic and nothing out of the ordinary... their service for the most point was on point and they did have a lot of regulars come in.. maybe the next time we come in we will try something else and see how everything else is.."}
{"text":"The mark of a good italian place is its ability to serve the simpler items on the menu with panache and delicacy.  Bell' Italia does that well. Service was attentive but not intrusive or pushy. We ordered the Ravioli and Spaghetti , and enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here we decided to check out Bell' Italia last night. 

As others have mentioned, its a tiny, family run place, maybe eight or ten tables total. They had the Sinatra going on the sound system, and the NY-LA game on the TV's, but the sound was turned all the way down on the game, which was good. The Sinatra was more pleasant to listen to than baseball announcers. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza (most of it for home leftovers), lobster ravioli, and ziti with meatballs. My wife had the sangria, which we all tasted. 

The food was all good. The prices were a little high compared to Vincent's, which is where we usually get Italian, but very much in line with any of the big chains. The pizza had a fairly thin crust, and was very good. The pastas, according to my wife and niece, were good. The sangria was real nice also. I'm more of a scotch and beer person and never acquired a taste for wine or wine products, so this is high praise coming from me. 

What made this place stand out was the service. Very rarely do you find a place as friendly as this. They made a real effort to help us keep our two-year old happy, bringing out some dough with a tiny little rolling pin for him to play with. They also gave us some cheesy garlic bread on the house, which we all loved. We also got the usual complementary bread and oil, of course, which was also good. 

All in all this is a really nice little place. Highly, highly recommended over chains like Olive Garden. We'll probably continue to order our carry-out from Vincent's, but when we're in the mood to go out for Italian food, Bell' Italia will be high on our list."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local restaurants. Pizza is great but don't miss the pasta dishes and lasagne. Love the Linguine with clams in the White Wine Sauce. My kids also love the big baked cookie dessert. Service is super friendly and I love to support this family owned business."}
{"text":"I want to give them 5 stars so bad because I went on a day when it was half off pasta dishes (monday and tuesdays for a limited time) and so my bill was super cheap, I feel like I robbed them. Anyway, came expecting to get pizza because I've had it before and it's really good but saw half off pasta dishes and figured I'd try them out. Service was excellent and everyone was really nice. For the full price (12-16 dollars) the pasta dishes would probably still be worth it as they were really good and come with a salad and bread but at half price this place is a steal. It doesn't get 5 stars because for me to give 5 stars I usually need to think either of two things while I'm eating: 

1) This is the best deal ever (if the prices were always 50% off I would say this for sure)

or

2) This is the best food ever 

This place is really really good and the service is REALLY great but it isn't ever going to be something I dream about at night. That being said, I would pick it over a chain italian place any day."}
{"text":"New to the area and I find myself trying all non chain restaurants in the neighborhood. My son and I were out Black Friday shopping and I asked him to google Italian restaurants with the best ratings and this restaurant was rated highly so we thought we'd give it a try and picked up dinner for the family to go. Pizza, mozzarella sticks, and chicken parmigiana. We just finished our meals.....and everyone is in a food coma. If I had a dollar for all the ooohhhs, aaahhhs and mmmmns throughout the meal, I'd be a wealthy woman. SERIOUSLY the best and most authentic Italian meal I've ever had. It was absolutely perfect. The sauce on everything was incredible. While waiting for our food, I was offered a sample of sangria. I've had sangria all over the country (also my favorite)....and again, this was a definite winner. Very fresh and light with real fruit in it like it should be prepared but most places skip out on. This restaurant will now be a staple for our family. I love unique restaurants and this fits the bill for all of us."}
{"text":"As a Chicago Italian, I appreciate good Italian food and this goes beyond good to absolutely great.  From the homemade Raviolis with lots of flavorful cheese to anything with Vodka sauce, this is some of the best food in town.  The Chicken Fettuccine is to die for and is the best I have ever had.  That's saying a lot for someone who grew up in an Italian household with an Italian Grandmother cooking.  When Italian food is cooked fresh and the specialties are something they have perfected and will even change for you on request, you can't get any better food.  Try the Scarparello with extra potatoes or the Fettuccine and you will have finally experienced it all."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Highly recommended. Food was fantastic and service was even better . Very  accommodating and pricing was reasonable. Especially,  on half night pasta night :) support this family run business. They deserve it!! :)"}
{"text":"One word.  Sangria.  I am a lightweight with the alcohol, and I had two glasses of their sangria.  It was excellent!  I had the spaghetti and meatballs for my main course and it was delicious.  We started with calamari for an appetizer and it was very nice as well.  It is a very cute place  I will definitely be going back.  I want to try some of their ravioli.  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This place serves some massively huge pizzas (with massively huge prices I might add). We had Bell 'Italia for a work function and the pizzas almost didn't fit in my car they were so huge. I got to try a variety of their pizza offerings with their white pizza with the ricotta being by far my favorite (garlic ftw) and their red sauced pizzas being a bit on the ordinary side. I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat this pizza, but it was fairly good."}
{"text":"Great little place. We had the sangria, garlic bread, and a small pizza. Everything was delicious. Crispy crust. We will come back."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I dine here as a party of 2 or a party of 10.
Friday 7/14 found me here with family celebrating our patriarch's birthday. Sangria was delicious, warm bread, brushetta and cheesy bread to start. Everyone picked their own entrees and there was a silence that came over everyone once the meal was served. The restaurant was busy with dine in and take out orders but we had the perfect amount of service from Matt.
Cannolis, need I say more...and cheesecake boxed to go for each of us.
We had one child in the group and she was kept entertained with dough and a rolling pin (vs electronics)
Only suggestion, decaf coffee. Two of us requested it and didn't have. They used too, because I remember a fine cappuccino and cannoli..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The pizza is fantastic. The service is superb and nice quaint atmosphere. Highly recommended for some delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Traveling from the mid-west looking for Great food. I found it here at Belle'. BY FAR the best calzone I've ever had, really. Beware they are larger than normal so you either need to be very hungry or have help to eat it. I'll search this little place out every time I  will return to PHX. I had a large order and they kept offering me comp drinks while I waited. This is why I like to find those hole-in-the-wall places. A true find. Awesome."}
