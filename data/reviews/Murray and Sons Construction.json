{"text":"I engaged them to do a swimming pool remodel. My sales man was a very nice man but his supervisor threatened me if I left a bad review. The workers had little knowledge of English and started filling up the pool and LEFT! Thats right WENT HOME. If I had not been here all the water would have been everywhere. When the supervisor finally came out at my request he accused me of not paying them. I had cancelled checks and let him review the payments. Most of the upgrades I requested were not done but were firmly stated on the contract.Mr. Supervisor broke one of the features of my pool and told me I could get it repaired at minimal cost.The supervisor threatened  and said he would \"get\" me if he saw a bad review on yelp. Racial innuendos were made and I had to summon my son. Leave these people alone!"}
{"text":"Gave them $3500 deposit. Said they would call the next day, they did not. Over the next 6 weeks I called 15 times and got 3 returned calls. Over 6 weeks they moved the schedule 5 times. During this entire process they claimed they were a good honest company, but no surprise when they refused to give us a refund when we canceled the project due to none performance."}
{"text":"As soon as they cashed my $15000 check, they stopped contacting me. After two weeks they said they want to cancel this contract because they have bigger jobs and this job is not making money for them. They never refunded me my $15000. They did not even start on my backyard, and they disappeared. They told me they are licensed - that was a LIE. They said they are BBB A+ that is a lie. Paul La Chance and Tiffany A Murray are the biggest con-artist that Arizona has seen. I am taking legal actions against them. And I am not alone. Be aware of their other companies they are working under Murray and sons license.  If you have been taken advantage by Murray and Sons Constructions please email me at ahwazi17 at yahoo. I would like to do something to make this guy leave the valley, and never hurt hardworking people like you and I."}
{"text":"We were given an estimate October 20 to remodel our backyard with pavers, artificial turf, tile and stucco a BBQ island and put an overlay on all the cement.    The pavers were installed 4 weeks ago along with the 200 sq ft of artificial turf that had been pieced together with  6 cuts of turf and 2 different types. It was not even the sample we had selected. It was a total mess!   Then 2 weeks went by with no work being done and given the run around about why the workers were not returning to finish the job they were contracted to do and why the grass was not installed properly.They attempted to stucco and set the tiles for the BBQ Island which is now damaged (cracked stucco, uneven tile cuts,and damaged front of frame). A second grass was attempted-- still not the sample we were told would be installed.   The cement coating was never installed.    We stopped all work  and are now trying to find another company that is honest, knowledgeable and capable of completing the job.  I would  not recommend this company for any construction.  The paver work was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Would give 1 Star if I were able to in this particular situation.  This company is unscrupulous and uses cheap materials and cheap labor to lower their bottom line.  They installed landscape lights and species one model but ultimately installed a TOTALLY different cheaper model.  As well they knew mother about low voltage loads or runs which ultimately caused me to have to redo my entire system ."}
{"text":"Just a little update- I won my judgement against and their counterclaim against me for $100,000 was dismissed.  His attorney, Lafette called me stating they were willing to drop their counterclaim if I dropped by case but there scare tactics did not work.  I will probably never see a dime but at least I won my judgement!"}
