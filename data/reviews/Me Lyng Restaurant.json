{"text":"This place has been around as long as I can remember, and is as good as I remember.  I've dined in, I've done take-out.  I was worried that they might not survive with the big chain competitor opening in The Waterfront.  Now it seems that the competitor is simply overpriced.  I'm glad to see that Me Lyng seems to have made it through and will continue to do well.  The prices and the food are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch or between lunch n dinner. We were the only ones in the place which is always a lil unnerving (is there something we should know?) Service was ok at the beginning but it seemed as though the server got busy playing a game on his phone. Food was ok but small lunch portions for the price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. They also serve Vietnamese varieties  I could not choose what my favorite dish is! I always try to get somthing different. So far, I like the Kanpien Beef a lot.  I also like the V05. It is a noodle dish and can be spicy. Its like Vietnamese BBQ.   The service is always good. You can bring wine to drink if youd like."}
{"text":"This is a little treasure in Homestead. A friend who lives in the area suggested it and I am so happy that she did. We celebrated my mom's birthday there and it was such a delightful experience. All of us enjoyed our food ( Hunan beef , kung pao chicken , shrimp with snow peas and cashew chicken in a spicy sauce). Each lunch came with soup, the hot-and-sour was delicious - I even ordered one to go - and an egg roll. We ordered from the Chinese menu but look forward to coming back and trying more things from the Vietnamese side. It's a great little Chinese restaurant the offers quality food at extremely reasonably priced. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in. Based on the good reviews place had a bad smell dirty chairs and floor Looked over menu that was also dirty and asked server what items were gluten free  She didn't know and walked over to other staff and came back and said the entire menu was gluten free It very clearly wasn't there were breaded and other entrees with egg noodles so we left They need to understand they could be making people very sick or maybe they don't care"}
{"text":"Placed my order online, went to pick it up, but to my surprise the restaurant is closed from the health department!! Guess we won't be eating there anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"We (group of 4) tried Me Lyng for the first time on a Saturday night at 6:15. The restaurant was 80% full, and a half hour later, it was completely full with a couple groups waiting. Service was slow, and when the waitress came over, she seemed surprised that no one had been over yet.   We ordered the Goi Cuon (fresh rolls), Bon Thit Nuong, chicken with broccoli, and lo mein. The waitress came to our table and said they were very busy and the Goi Cuon would be a little longer - they make it all from scratch, including the shrimp and chicken. It was well worth the wait. They were so fresh and not a hint of fish smell/taste that sometimes come with these.  The food finally arrived and it was without a doubt the best Chinese/Vietnamese we've ever had. The vegetables were fresh and the sauces flavorful, without the typical heavy feel of most Chinese food. Before we left an hour and 45 minutes later, the waitress again thanked us for our patience.   The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars if for the slow service, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it isn't always that way. Even if it is, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well after going there a few times the food seemed to be back to what it used to be the 1st time I tried them. My only complaint is the grease for the egg rolls but that is common for anything deep fried. I do say their honey chicken is still very yummy but the BBQ ribs are still a little tough and dry but still edible. Will be going there time to time for the honey chicken."}
{"text":"Coworker recommended, so this was a sweet surprise on a Friday night. Song Sing chicken was perfectly crispy and tangy. Hot and sour soup was superbly fresh. Loved that super egg roll. Service was personal. Not too pricey. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been a well known secret in the Munhall area for years! The food. Is wonderful& plentiful. The eggrolls are the best I ve had anywhere, bar none. You are never rushed through your meal & the food is served promptly. While a lil sad to see the secret get out , I m glad for the owner Tom & his family.   Misti"}
{"text":"Great food! The crab Ragoons were delicious. We ordered the beef pho and I have to say...I have had pho at many many different places, both around Pittsburg and out in California and this was close to my favorite. The meat was so tender and broth was flavorful. Also they give you a huge amount of noodles. They brought out fresh basil, lemons and crunchy bean sprouts. Along with sauces for the soup. This would be the perfect place to get pho with family or friends who want something other than pho as their menu is huge and there are so many choices. Staff is personable and the place is nice and clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Me Lyng is the last, great remnant of the old 8th Ave. Gone are Chiodo's Mystery Meat sandwich and the legendary Dawn's Donuts. Me Lyng has been a staple in Homestead for as long as I can remember.  I highly recommend the Vietnamese dishes over the Chinese ones. I normally order the pho xao, which always turns heads. If you're not a fan of onions, you can get this dish without them, which I suggest doing.  I love the ambiance of the place. The new facade allows for great natural lighting during the daytime and I recommend their lunch specials (they're cheap and good). The decor is nothing fancy but there's something about this place that is very warm and inviting.  Sadly, the past few times I've been there, the service wasn't so great. Like most mom & pop Asian restaurants in the area, Me Lyng employs (who I'm assuming are) the management/owner's teenage children. All but one of them are good servers. If you get the one that isn't, you'll know within the first 2 minutes! Here's a hint, it's the girl who's playing on her phone.   If you're shopping at the Waterfront, cross over the tracks and eat here!"}
{"text":"We had the Chinese New Year feast (6 people) last night, for something like the 20th year, and it was, as always a wonderful experience!  8 courses, each delicious and beautifully presented.  Service, as always, efficient and pleasant.  Price for the feast is extremely reasonable.  We have been regulars (for the regular menu, not just the New Year one) since the place opened over 30 years ago, and it's our go-to for great Chinese and Vietnamese food.   It's apparently a lot of other people's go-to as well, because the nicely decorated restaurant is usually busy and the customers all seem to leave with a happy experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Me Lyng and I was pleasantly surprised.  We started with crab Rangoon appetizer with a sweet sauce that was yummy and a nice portion too.  For dinner we shared a Vietnamese dish for two called Banh Xeo.  We chose chicken as our meat.  When it came out, we were both very puzzled.  It looked like an egg omelet on one dish, iceberg lettuce leaves on another dish and a light sauce in a bowl.  We asked our waiter how to eat it and he told us to cut up the omelet and put them in the lettuce leaves to make wraps.  To our surprise, it was crunchy, light and very tasty!  Full of bean sprouts, chicken and such, delightful.  Very nice and attentive server too!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was not only the absolute worst, tasteless, slimy, Chinese food I have ever eaten, it is easily the worst FOOD I have ever eaten. The orange steak look liked wrinkled up pieces of Steak Ums. The chicken was chewy and stringy and was either overcooked or sat for days. The fried wontons were nothing but little rubbery cat turds the size of a dime surrounded by the shape of a fried wonton. I would not wish this restaurant upon my worst enemy."}
{"text":"It's a gem in Homestead.  Better than chain, better than good.  The food was authentic, the atmosphere was professional.  The servers were courteous and kind to help out with menu questions.  If you're in the area, it's worth a try.  BYOB"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for as long as I can remember.  I have many special memories as it was always my place to go to to celebrate any special occasion.  Even after I moved away, it is still my \"go to\" place after all of these years.  I even still meet up here around 4x a month to visit with my Mother.  Since introducing it to my own children, they beg me to bring them there as often as I can get them in the area.  The quality of the food is phenomenal, and the service is great as well.  You will find no other restaurant in the area that accomplishes both of these to the extent that Me Lyng does.  They make you feel like you are family from the second you walk in the door.    Regarding their food, I would also add that you will find no other Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant that uses the freshest and highest quality ingredients like they do here.  There is no remnants of \"pre boxed\" or \"frozen\" tasting food like you get from most other Chinese restaurants around.  They actually MAKE their food here.  The prices are fair, and the portion sizes are large.  Recommendations:  Their wonton soup, egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken and fried rice are the best I have EVER had.  In all my years, I have yet to find anywhere else that even comes close.  Also highly recommend the Garlic Chicken, Hunan Beef, Pho and basically anything else on their extensive menu!    I've NEVER had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I should have written this review months ago after we had our rehearsal dinner there!  Back in late November, I was looking for a Vietnamese restaurant to have our rehearsal dinner. My family is from Vietnam and I wanted to have it at a place where we could have a few of our family favorites! After looking at every Vietnamese place in town there was 2 problems, space to for 20-25 people and no flexibility with their menu.  Then I called to speak with the owner here and he asked me to come in with a menu of what we wanted to serve at our rehearsal dinner, and oh man did they deliver!  His whole staff was so accommodating and most of the things we ordered were off the menu. They whipped up salt and pepper shrimp, Vietnamese style lobster, tofu and veggies, fried spring rolls, whole fried fish, and a verity of appetizers. Everything was perfect and the portions were so generous! Even my in laws were so impressed by the menu!  I seriously recommend this place for any occasion, and ask them for a recommendation if you don't know what to order.  We are so happy to have this hidden gem in Homestead!  Can't thank you enough for your hospitality, everyone still talks about the food from that night!"}
{"text":"Old school Chinese meets Vietnamese in a clean joint with people who know all about good service!  I was really excited to try this spot after passing by for so many years.  There is a small parking lot on the side of the building and I quickly snatched up a spot.  We were immediately greeted and then seated upon entry.  Looking around, this place looks familiar even if you haven't been here before.  There is a counter to the right and dining tables are spread out throughout.  It's somewhat small but the space is intimate---it works.   We decided on some lo mein, egg rolls and wonton soup.  The lo mein was just good...I mean solid good.  Large shrimp with a good mix of veggies---all perfectly seasoned.  The eggroll had the standard stuffing of cabbage, other veggies and pork.  It was crunchy and tasty.  They bring out the sweet and sour sauce in these plastic ramekin type dishes.  Since these ramekins go table to table, I'm not quite sure how clean they are so I never use the contents.  The wonton soup was just ok.  The menu has a nice selection of Vietnamese cuisine as well.    The owner and his son were there on the day that I visited and were both attentive.  The owner seems very interested in feedback and you can tell he wants everyone to have a great meal in his establishment.  I'm truly looking forward to going back and trying out some more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I love me lyng. Tuan, the owner, is one of the nicest people on the planet. He will greet you with a smile and provide you with anything he can to make your experience great. Wait staff can be admittedly slow but polite. They are young, mostly family. But the food is the best Chinese in Pittsburgh. Me lyng is the most underrated place amongst all the frequented Chinese spots around 15217. You can get the dinner for 4 and feed 5 for 55 bucks!  We get the sesame chicken, the moo shoo pork, beef and broccoli and the chicken lo mein. It's off the charts good. Comes with egg roll, dumpling, AND soup. You can't beat it. Plus byob. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"All the great reviews made me wanna try this one, since I love Asian food. Free parking right next to the restaurant was nice. Interior was dated and didnt look clean, including a layer of dust on the wall next to our table.  Food was - unfortunately - really not very good. I wanted to like this place, but I couldnt. I ordered sweet n sour shrimp. The shrimp looked huge when I got them, so I was excited. However, what I found out in the first bite was that the shrimp were actually tiny. And I mean tiny, like 1/2 inch size. They just had a layer of greasy dough around them that blew them up to well over 1 inch size. I ended up peeling the dough off and just had this huge plate full of dough - never mind the annoying/ messy work. My husband had a beef dish that he said wasn't very tasty, plus the ratio of lettuce-bed to beef made us think that they must have mistaken my husband for a bunny... Service was very disinterested, they were staring at a laptop while we were waiting for the check to come...  Sorry, but never again. And I am very surprised that other people had such a vastly different experience..."}
{"text":"Delicious and a suggestion? The food is very yummy? Fried rice is authentic and delicious?maybe the best in the town? Rosted duck is good too? Better than the ducks in New York china twon.    I took one star off is because they didn't clean the tea cup very well. It was sticky on the edge of the cup. See the photo?"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon on this restaurant and thought I I could taste some authentic Vietnamese food. It turned out that all phos and classic food cannot be used for the groupon. It should state at the first place on the condition of the Groupon. The restaurant looks very dirty and old"}
{"text":"Considering the price, this place is a great value, with a big menu.  The restaurant is quiet with good service.  It's great to support a family business in the day of chain everything."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this in Homestead. We consider this place a hidden gem. I had the shrimp with brown sauce it was delicious. The hot and sour soup was wonderful. It is slightly different from other Chinese or Asian restaurants that I've seen. I will be coming back here on my visits to Homestead. This is an inexpensive yet delicious place for lunch. We will have to try supper."}
{"text":"The price is very acceptable, with appetizers ranging $3-5, entrees ranging $10-15. The taste is on the sweet side, but works for us. From the decoration, one can tell it's a restaurant with history, which on the other hand indicates good quality! Service was about average. Will visit again next time in the area."}
{"text":"We got a to go order, the food was all around terrible. It wasn't like how sometimes you go to a Chinese restaurant and it just tastes like cheap food, it was more like whoever made our food never cooked anything in their life. They also filled the to go containers 75% full of uncooked cabbage and put the chicken on top, I guess to trick people into thinking they got a full order. They mustn't be worried about getting repeat customers."}
{"text":"After reading reviews both here and on other sites, we decided to try it.  It was 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday.  The whole dining experience began with them out of the Vietnamese appetizer I wanted to try.  So I ordered 2  old stand-bys - wanton soup & an egg roll.  My husband ordered steamed dumplings.  Soup was just barely lukewarm & way over salted.  Egg roll was greasy, cold & tasteless.  Only the hot mustard saved it.  Dumplings were very good.  Ordered chicken with cashew nuts.  Not a single cashew. Veggies might have been waved over the wok - huge pieces of green pepper, celery (stalk cut into 1/3's), big chunks of carrots all so crunchy, I almost asked for a dip to go with them!  Food very cold.  When I complained there was not 1 nut on plate, he said they forgot to put them on top.  He came back with a dish of warm cashews and put them on my entree.  No sense in complaining about temp of food - I don't take any chances of irritating the chef/cook.  While my husband liked what he ordered (can't remember - poh something with chicken), it also was cold.  Only item that was hot was the complimentary tea.  Best thing about this restaurant - our waiter was pleasant & polite - we tipped him the usual 20% we tip - it wasnt his fault. We absolutely love the food at Yummy's in the Rostraver/Belle Vernon area.  We like to order take-out.  We live 20 minutes from there and the food is piping hot when we get it home!  We won't stray from there again.  Sorry, Me Lyng - food was cold, tasteless & mine was lacking one of the titled ingredients.  Never again."}
{"text":"Me Lyng Restaurant has been a part of Homestead for as long as I can remember. A friend and I stopped for dinner one evening, knowing I enjoy Chinese food, it was a great choice and so pleased with the entire evening. It was my first time there. I ordered of course, the Chicken w Broccoli.  I love the oriental decor of the restaurant. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, that makes dining a good experience in my opinion. The service was excellent, prompt, friendly and very helpful in choice selection. I love the fact that it is a BYOB. They are starting to be my favorite dining spots.  I will return, most definitely. The marketing has allowed for coupon discounts and other methods to draw customers in. The best marketing this restaurant can do is continue to give great service and allow the word of mouth to bring dinners in."}
{"text":"Had a dinner for two. Hot tea they brought was awful, overbrewed and just bad. Didn't have any green hot tea, that's a surprising dissapointment for an asian restaurant.  Appetizers were average, fried shrimp was over-breaded and over-fried.  Rice-paper roll with veggies was bland, not tasty at all.  Main courses were a little better, Pho soup came without sprouts, peppers or limes on a side, but overall was not bad. Had no basil in it nor jalapenos, had to add some hot sause, which it not the same. Vegetables with fried noodles were just average.  Service was ok, but not outstanding, very slow, albeit it was Thur. evening, but the room was not even half full.  Not going back, NO recommend."}
{"text":"Average at best. The crab rangoon and orange chicken were forgettable. Nice decor though"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places I've been to. And it's great for sit down/eat in as well which I find a lot of Chinese places around the area are not. The poo poo platter was awesome as were our entrees, however the names of them escape me at the moment, my apologies.  Service is as one would expect in a Chinese restaurant, no major complaints from me.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for delicious Chinese food in the burgh."}
{"text":"The food here was ok, but the service was absolutely horrible. Looked like 4 kids were running the place, and they were more interested in playing on their phones than bringing food or drinks to tables.   I definitely won't eat here again!"}
{"text":"Something has to be good since this restaurant has been in businees for 25 years.  Our server has worked here for 10 years.  It was quite interesting to see that the servers were quite obviously the children of the owners.  The amazing part was that they were quite professional during the duration of our meal.  Having had some fairly bad Chinese food in the area, I was on my last ounce of hope.  The interior is very sparsely decorated, but it reminded me of the little mom and pop places that I saw in Suzhou, China.  I was intrigued by this little Chinese restaurant in Homestead that was packed with locals.  Since I hadn't satisfied my Chinese craving yet, I already knew what I wanted and told the server the entire order:  Panfried Pierogi/Dumplings Egg Drop Soup Wonton Soup Yeung chow (combo fried rice, no peas, no carrots) Generals (Piquancy 7/10)  As I ordered, the kids were bringing out food to the other tables and it smelled wonderful.  Our soups arrived rather fast.  I went directly for my egg drop soup and was hit by this taste of white pepper.  Too much white pepper was in the soup.  I tried the wonton soup and it had the same issue -- too much white pepper.  This wasn't a deal-killer since the soups both still had a decent flavor; I just had to get past that white pepper flavor.  The egg drop soup was a bit heavier than I would normally get, but after the ones at Mandarin Gourmet and Sesame Inn, I was happy.  The panfried dumplings arrived to the table.  My eyes and belly were happy to see these dumplings.  They were a little thick, but the meat and the shells were well-flavored and the dipping sauce had a good mixture of sweet, salty, and acidic.  We quickly devoured the dumplings with a swiftness.  I did find it amusing that they were shaped just like pierogies -- was this to help the locals?  I don't know, but they tasted good.  While eating our food, the same dish was being served to table after table on a sizzling skillet and it smelled wonderful.  When the little bus-girl took our plate, I asked her what it was and she said it was the Garlic Chicken -- I am adding that to my list of items to try here.  Our entrees arrived; the General's Chicken -- true to form -- was completely different from every single other Chinese restaurant in the world.  It was the chunk, fried variety with a fairly dark, thick sauce.  It was definitely NOT piquant at a 7 (mental note for a 10 next time) and the flavor was different.  It was slightly salty with a bitter taste that wasn't offensive.  I wish it were a bit more piquant.     The combination fried rice wasn't bad.  It was better than most fried rices, but it used the salad shrimp.  I have become used to eating my yeung chow fried rice with actual shrimp in it.  Other than that little irksome item, I enjoyed my friend rice.  It wasn't drenched in soy sauce even though it was a little oily.  We ate all of the food, and as I was reviewing the check, the old lady behind me placed her order.  She asked for a 10 with a side of chili sauce.  I was surprised but I realized that my instincts were correct about ordering a 10/10 next time.   This is a 3.5 stars, but bumped up to 4 since I know I will return."}
{"text":"Had a great evening here.  Very polite service, and the free oolong tea is delicious.  We stuck to the Vietnamese menu, and everything we tried was good; I'd especially recommend the crab and asparagus soup and the lemongrass sauces."}
{"text":"This is my go to place every week!  Sesame shrimp with snow peas and brown rice.  It is fantastic.  Tom & Anna are great people too.  Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan.  I was first introduced to this place a few years back by a good friend who used to live down the street from the business.  This restaurant is basic, but nice, and the food is fantastic.  I have met the owner and had a nice chat, his mother is vietnamese, and father a US soldier, with him when he first opened the restaurant, and he seems to still work it from Sun up to Sun down.  There are not a lot of vegetarian options advertised, but one can probably make most of the dishes veggie.  I had the spring roll, deep fried, and the vegetable Lo Mein, and very good.  Friendly staff that does not hover, or bother you.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"This place has been here for as long as I can remember. I've had it on my list of places to return to for quite some time (last time was about 20 years ago) but for some reason I never think of it when it comes time to dine. Well it did dawn on me as an option for dinner before the Gregg Allman show and when I suggested it to my girl 'B' we decided to give it a go.   The décor has sort of an upscale Asian aura to it.  We were seated promptly with menus. Feeling adventurous, I decided to go with the Vietnamese Pho Xao and 'B' went with her tried and true Hunan Chicken. Both arrived within 5 minutes of ordering and they were both delicious.   The service, cleanliness, food quality and atmosphere, in my opinion, all give this place a five star review. The only reason it gets knocked down to four is that there is no beer or wine available unless you BYOB. Regardless, I'm sure it won't take me 20 years to come back again."}
{"text":"First time visitor to Me Lyng, my wife and I were not sure what to expect from this Vietnamese / Chinese restaurant. We ended up being pleasantly surprised.  We ordered soup each, I had Hot and Sour while my wife had the Vegetable. My was certainly different than the Hot and Sour I usually get at Chinese restaurants, but still good. My wife was pleased with her soup also. We shared an order of the Vietnamese appetizer, two large spring rolls. They were filled with tofu, noodles and lettuce. Not too interesting and i would say average tasting.  My wife got V06. I don't remember the name as it was in Vietnamese but she was able to get it in tofu, because she is vegan. It came with a nice tasting sauce and orange noodles. I had a taste and it was good. I ordered V05, a marinated chicken. I have to say the chicken was tender and tasted awesome and I ate the whole big bowl full. I was extremely satisfied.  Many people have commented on the slow service, but ours was quick and friendly. They were very helpful and accommodating to my wife's vegan needs. The interior is pleasant, what you would expect at any Chinese restaurant. We are definitely coming back to Me Lyng in the future and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Food is good it seems like there giving you less food every time I come here which is odd. parking is very sketchy but I think they are widening the lot more so that may-not be a problem anymore"}
{"text":"Went here and ordered to go for lunch.   What I ordered:  Fresh rolls Lunch combination plate of chicken and broccoli.  It came with a small hot and sour soup as well as an egg roll and fried rice.   The fresh rolls came with a really delicious peanut sauce and they were a nice size with delicious fresh shrimp inside.  I would definitely order this again (my husband even enjoyed the second roll from the order with his lunch the next day).   The chicken and broccoli was delicious.  The broccoli was still fresh and crisp and the sauce was  delicious.    Overall I enjoyed it, but the egg roll was greasy and the rice was bland.  I will probably be back especially for those fresh rolls."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place, tucked away on Eighth Ave in Homestead, just west of the Homestead Grays Bridge. You probably wouldn't think to stop in there, but I think that you will be pleasantly surprised if you do. Their menu is split into Chinese and Vietnamese selections. The orange chicken was fabulous, and not like the heavy breaded, generic kind that you seem to find everywhere. This was light, with a very nice citrus taste. I also had the Vietnamese pho soup - a favorite dish of mine that I have had in many places. While not quite authentic, the broth was tasty, and the serving was generous. The decor was pleasant, and the restaurant was clean. Anyone who wants good Asian food while visiting the Waterfront, I would defnitely recommend this place."}
