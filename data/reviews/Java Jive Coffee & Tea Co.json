{"text":"Didn't try the coffee but the mocha and cap were terrible. The guy didn't seem like he knew what he was doing. However, the croissant was surprisingly better its appearance. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been getting my morning coffee here recently.  The place is always busy and the staff are extremely friendly.  They already know my drink and make me feel welcome, even when they are sooooo busy.  And it's clearly a local hang out all hours of the day."}
{"text":"My android Yelp app was kind enough to show me which cafes near my hotel were open at 7am, which wasn't many. Java Jive was closest and the name was familiar. Their vegetable omelette was a small step down from the Croissant Tree, but it was only $5 and that included toast and (out-of-a-bag) homefries. Coffee was really good and the service was pleasant and quick. They could have spent a bit of time before opening cleaning up the patio furniture. The table was covered in street grime/dust and I leaned back into some bird brap (not sure why I didn't see it). Probably good patio advice anywhere: watch where you're sitting. (On my second visit the tables were all wiped and the chairs were clean. A sparrow sat on the table eyeing my toast. Disgusting and cute all at the same time.)"}
{"text":"Java Jive, located at then north end of the \"Gay Village\" is a nice locally run coffee shop.  Not some pretentious barrista clad arm and leg expresso bar but a good old fashioned coffee shop.  Usually you'll be greeted by Eugene (formerly of Church St Diner) who will give a big smile and run through his specials of the day.  there is good coffee, good grub and sweet treats to be had.  There is a good cross section of people and always a good conversation to be had here."}
{"text":"Best part of this place is the really friendly staff!  They are super nice, always recognize us when we go in, and go out of their way to be helpful.  They have pretty good baked goods too.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely a pretty good muffin.     They don't have too much out of the ordinary, which is why i'm not giving it a higher review.   Nothing too spectacular, but a great place to grab a quick coffee if you're passing by."}
{"text":"Craving a traditional breakfast omelet in the middle of the day can be frustrating, especially if you come back from a nightclub and need to replenish your energy by consuming a hearty meal full of proteins and complex carbohydrates. I happened to stop by the Java Jive on a snowy Monday morning in December looking for a traditional omelet. Having passed this place numerous times on my way home, I decided to give them a try, and I am glad I did as I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the end product and their friendly customer service.  Although rather limited on vegetarian options when it comes to omelets, the person who took initiative to replace my ham slices with turkey slices (I do eat poultry and fish, just not red meat) and was so kind to offer me a discount because I had purchased two combos (one for a friend, the other for me).  I ordered a great tasting pumpkin spice latte that was tasty, and my overall dining experience was comfortable and relaxing. Since it was cold out there, use of the patio area was not available, and therefore I dined inside. Composed mostly of high tables and stools, it was not the most glamorous set-up but it did do its job of proving me a warm environment for my meal. With great prices and great service, Java Jive is definitely a place to check out when you're in the Village."}
{"text":"All day breakfast and cheap.  $4.99 for 2 eggs, 2 sausage (or bacon), 2 slices of toast and home fries.    Ordered eggs sunny side up and perfectly cooked so the yolk comes spilling out and I can dip my toast in all that cholesterol (*cough* I mean \"yolk).  Home fries had good seasoning to them - some kind of garlic and chive/onion/parsley (I dunno - some green stuff) and were moderately salty - exactly how I like my stuff.  Sausage was fairly tasty too.  I also ordered a coffee with the Yelp check-in offer for $1 and had the Church blend. It was okay.  Nothing special, but not bad either. Better than Balzac's in my opinion.    Overall, big meal for $6 including taxes, which is a lot better than Sunset Grill near Yonge/Bloor.  Might have to visit again now."}
{"text":"After a brief stint as Cups on Church the former Java Jive is now Java Jive again. I'm not sure why, but the old Java Jive sign/canopy over the door had been painted blue and the new name added. Now the canopy/sign over the door says Java Jive again."}
{"text":"Turns out Eugene isn't the owner! I maintain that it's a great little spot."}
{"text":"This place is charming in it's simplicity. Walk in and ask \"What's for lunch today?\"  and let the owner offer his suggestions.   Yesterday, $5.75 (no tax) got me a cute little hamburger and a small salad. (I think I'm entitled to refer to my hamburger as cute when I'm eating in the village.)  Sure, the burger was overcooked, but it was still tasty.  They have rotating lunch specials as well as breakfast, sandwiches, some simple baked goods, and of course coffee and espresso based drinks.   Prices are great, the outdoor patio is very popular, and the clientele is.....interesting."}
{"text":"I love this little gem on the north end of the village.  It's called Cups on Church now, and the owner Eugene is pretty much the friendliest dude I've ever seen behind a counter.  The rest of the staff are helpful and friendly, too.     You can usually get one of their drip coffee blends without waiting, but if the carafe is empty they'll offer to brew up a fresh batch if you don't mind waiting (and it's not five minutes to close, of course).  You can always grab an espresso based drink, too.   I started frequenting here when I moved into the neighbourhood over on the other side of Isabella Street; although they rotate the flavoured coffee regularly, if you're lucky enough to run across the blueberry, you'll probably be hooked right off the bat just like I was.   As for food, there's always a selection of treats available - if you grab a home-made oatmeal bar, go for the raspberry (but the blueberry's good too). I really dig the breakfast sandwiches, too.  As a matter of fact, the only time(s) I've ever relapsed back to a Tim Horton's sandwich after trying one from Cups on Church was due to 3 or 4 am drunken carousing (Cups closes at the absolute latest around 8 or 9 pm most days during the summer).  Give it a shot, and ask Eugene what's for lunch/dinner/brunch - where does this guy find the time to cook every day?"}
{"text":"I come in once a week to get a pound of flavoured coffee.. it rotates almost weekly.. its amazing.  Ive never had such a great selection of coffee and its a fantastic flavour for my French Press at home :)"}
{"text":"Popped in here for a tea and found some great looking (and later found out, tasty) sandwiches.  They have a large patio that stretches down the entire side of their building and there is always someone sitting in it, no matter what the season.  Aside from the sandwiches they offer the basics of any coffee shop; pastries, bagels, cookies, etc.  This is a great little spot for a quite hang-out or to enjoy a hot beverage in the shade."}
