{"text":"Great food....one of the best burgers in Charlotte. Spuds are good and a very generous portion. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Before the panthers game yesterday we watched an employee from rustys deli walk an old grandma across a parking lot at ultra slow grandma speed carrying her food while she held the tiny umbrella with torrential rain and river flowing through the parking lot. He insisted she use the umbrella herself. As he came back looking like he jumped in a swimming pool I gave the guy a high five as he made it back to the door. Not only does this place have good it has good people. Been that way since high school....and yes my son and I sat outside in a covered spot to people watch running through the parking lot river.(ponchos behind us)"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Rusty's several times per month and love it.  Their menu is simple - sandwiches, burgers, soups/salads, fries - but the quality is consistenly good.  I love their reubens, and their fries are always hot, crispy and plentiful.  Other great picks - BLT, cheeseburger, chicken salad, bratwurst.

I love Rusty's and always recommend it to my family and friends if we're looking for a simple place to have a lunch or small dinner.  My dad discovered it several years ago while my mother and I were shopping for my wedding dress and I'm so glad he did!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem, can't believe it took me five years to find out about Rusty's, great lunchtime crowd. The reuben was great and they have Dr. Brown's soda which is always a good sign! Will definitely visit again instead of going to a larger chain for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had the Charlotte Cheesesteak with mushrooms and a side of fries today !!  The cheesesteak was other worldy and the fries where too many to eat !!  I cant wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"I try to make it to Charlotte at least once a month, and if I'm in the relative area of Charlotte, I always make a Rusty's stop in the itinerary. I have always got the French Dip and never once have I been disappointed. The chili cheese fries are also very tasty. Small little hole in the wall restaurant, that offers great food, has friendly service, awesome cookies, and awesome sandwiches. Looking forward to my next Charlotte trip just for the Dip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not much to look at, but it is the place to go in South Charlotte for excellent simple fare: burgers, sandwiches, etc.  This is definately our favorite place to go on a Saturday for lunch after a late Friday night, or to grab a quick take out dinner during the week.  The cheeseburgers compete with any other place in town.  Philly cheese steak is excellent as well.  Staff is friendly and enthusiastic.  Prices are very reasonable.  Only drawback is that we wish it was open on Sundays.  A rarity in Charlotte: a great, independent, non-chain delli/ grill."}
{"text":"Consistency! Rusty's has served GREAT chicken salad for decades. This place is the perfect spot for families, business lunchers, and baby boomers (golden oldies played) the staff is friendly and helpful. Service is fast and efficient. I simply cannot say enough."}
{"text":"Seems like Rusty's has been a staple here in south Charlotte forever. I have been coming here since I was a little kid, and not much has changed (that's a good thing!). This place has everything you'd expect from a deli/grill: hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, tuna salad, cheesesteaks, fries, etc. But what puts Rusty's Deli above the rest is the quality and consistency; you can expect the same delicious meal with every visit. 

What should you try? Start off when one of the delicious customizable burgers, or experience their killer Reuben. Pair it up with a nice craft bottled beer as well. 

Seriously, you can't beat this place. When a restaurant has been around for as long as Rusty's has, you know it is something special."}
{"text":"I grew up around the corner from Rusty's and I've been going here for as long as I can remember. You walk in and they've got a nice selection of canned and bottled beverages - including beer. Then you walk up and order from the guy in the kitchen. I usually get a chicken salad sandwich - so good - but today I tried the black bean burger and it was really good. It had salsa and cheddar cheese on top, and a side of sour cream. Sandwiches don't come with anything but a pickle, so you have to order fries on the side if you want. After you order, you continue down the aisle to the cash register - passing by chips, fountain soda, sweet tea, etc.. You pay and get a number, and then they bring your food to your table. Everything is always tasty, the people who work at Rusty's are always incredibly sweet and it's overall a great experience."}
{"text":"My coworker suggested that we try this place for lunch. Super yummy!!! My coworkers had cheese burgers and chicken sandwiches. The fries are great!!! They have a good variety of food options (veggie, salads, and sandwiches).  They are quick, friendly and clean. I would suggest checking it out!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner, and eat at this local place all the time.  There's no better cheeseburger in Charlotte.  Awesome folks working there, super friendly, great comfort food.  Always exactly what you need.  Only complaint is that it not open for lunch (or any meal) Sunday, when we need it the most!  It's the jewel in this strip mall."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte for a long time running.  The reubens are delicious as well.  Great service -- easy in and out.  Why would you go to a chain???"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. The Reuben was so small and only half an inch thick. Took 40 minutes for food to come out. The fries were dry and undercooked. Just really nothing good about this place at all. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  I nice surprise we found last weekend.  I indulged in \"Rusty's Totally Loaded Burger\" and my husband had \"Rusty's Reuben\" with 1000.  Both were out of this world good.  A nice surprise was the various array of bottled beers, waters, etc. to choose from if you prefer something other than fountain.  

The space is small with limited seating inside but it IS worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Great food!   Outdoor seating.  Sandwiches, fries and free refills on drinks.  They recently got rid of their free wifi.  NO WIFI IS Disappointing since we do not have cell phone service, so I had to  post to yelp outside connected to another business free WIFI."}
{"text":"Great place, great food! Love the Chicken Philly (get it with mushrooms)! They also have good vegetarian options.

It's nice also to support the locally owned business, they really know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here with my family since I was in pre school (20 years ago) and it's one of the few unchanged businesses around this area. My entire family is vegetarian, so it's awesome that they have good options for us like their veggie burger/ black bean burger. I have a lot of great memories in this place, and it makes me happy that they're still around and doing well for themselves!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost 3 times every week and I love Rusty's, so glad my boss showed me this place. The fries are perfect, crispy with just the right touch of salt. I swear by the chicken philly, hands down one of the best sandwhiches I've had. Really great atmosphere during lunch as well."}
{"text":"Deli food prepared properly.  A must are the French fries with crunchy outside with fluffy hot insides, might be best ever and side is big enough to share.  Cheese steak sandwich is delicious and hamburger a tad greasy, but delicious taste with sautee onions with all the fixings.  Do not ignore the deli case when you come in, inside is a slice of NY cheesecake that is a slice of creamy rich deliciousness that must be consumed every visit.    Place gets lots in strip plaza that should be found by all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Consistently good and the people are great! This is my 4 years old's favorite place to eat, too. We're born & raised Charlotteans so we know best ;)
Best cheeseburger, BLT and Black Bean Burger. Don't you dare eat the fries without dipping them in their homemade ranch."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Good burgers, sandwiches. The restrooms are fresh and clean!
Try the chicken salad sandwich and the cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is now my new \"favorite\" hamburger/deli spot!! When I first looked over the menu I was somewhat taken aback by the prices as each sandwich does not come with a side. However once I purchased the fully loaded rusty burger and the bratwurst I was very impressed!!! The burger was delicious and had plenty of toppings. This is definitely a 2 hands on burger! The bratwurst was hefty enough to serve as dinner!  I also love the eclectic decor with National Geographic magazines available to read. All in new condition! I definitely will be returning and plan to go thru the menu one item at a time. Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Per dollar, your not going to find any better food close by.  I'm not saying literally \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"  But, on that side of town I don't know of any other place you can get full and have a beer for under $10.

It is a Deli/Grille with beer.  Pretty straight forward.  You grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order, then you order at the counter.  You walk around the side to pay and they give you a number.  Put that number on your table, and your food will be delivered shortly.  No wait service, just fast service.  I prefer eating out on the patio if there is space available.

There is quite a variety of choices.  From burgers to french dips.  Bratwurst to meatball subs.  Salads, stuffed potatoes, and even some vegetarian options.  I've tried it all and never had a bad meal.

I know this review sounds more like an ad for the place, but I really have nothing bad to say.  Its a chill little spot that puts out great food at a reasonable price.  Kind of unheard of on park rd."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good burger and fries this place works. Gets pretty bust at lunch time so be prepared!"}
{"text":"I like Rusty's deli - the food has always been fresh and tastes great.  It is a Charlotte institution & I remember going back in the 80s.  

However, it can be a little tricky getting in and out during peak times -  especially on Saturdays.  Be prepared to wait for a table on a busy Saturday and especially if you have more than 2 or 3 people in your party. 

Unfortunately, the crowded little space they occupy detracts from the overall dining experience.  But, when it is not too hot & humid outdoors, there is outdoor seating where you don't feel as claustrophobic.

The salads are good here as are the spuds - my fav is the turkey & cheese... yum-o!

Despite the challenges of the small space and awkward layout, I would still recommend Rusty's for someone looking for an independently owned deli with a little local flavor."}
{"text":"Rusty's is the kind of diner/hole in the wall joint that always serves consistency. The menu isn't ground breaking. They're not going for a Michelin Star here and the goal is to serve good, consistent food day in and day out. 

Rusty's is quaint and humble from the outside. (Beware of the construction happening in Quail Corners) Just a few tables with umbrellas, a small neon sign and a basic white spelling of \"Rusty's\" above the building. The interior is great. Almost like a flashback from the 90's. Business cards all over the wall to your left, cooler of drinks, large menu next to the ordering window, tons of copies of National Geographic in the dining area....Just a great little joint. 

The menu is pretty standard deli style. Sandwiches, soups, potatoes, salads. My wife and I usually go for a double-decker pb&j but sometimes we venture out of our mainstay. The potatoes are rather large with a gratuitous amount of toppings. Not my favorite, but worth a try if you're hungrier than usual. I love their Reuben. Not a huge NY style stack of pastrami. Just a medium-sized 'wich with sauerkraut and Thousand Island. Simple and familiar. 

I love Rusty's. A great local, hole in the wall that serves the same dependable food day in and day out. Thanks, Rusty's!"}
{"text":"YUM. Great burgers. Also, they have Cherry soda, and Malt vinegar. That's amazing."}
{"text":"Rusty's is a no-fuss deli that has been a Charlotte staple for years. With a selection of regular sandwich, hot deli sandwiches and salads to choose from. The setup is probably the only downside to Rustys. If you're not a fan of standing in line, this is probably not the place for you during the mad lunch rush. You will stand in a line to order at a counter, and then stand in another cafeteria-style line to check out and receive your order. 

While the sandwiches and french fries may have been what made Rustys \"Charlotte Famous\", don't sleep on the cheeseburgers. They are sneaky wonderful."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my girlfriend today. Service was friendly and food came quick for us. I got a cheesesteak and she got a grilled chicken sandwich. Overall food was good and this was a very nice local place. Would recommend and we will be back for another visit."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed. I just found it out this past Tuesday when I had to go to the Urgent Care that is in the same parking lot.
They have the best chicken soup that I've ever had in this country ( I am from Brazil). The soup was so good I even ordered one to go.
My husband ordered a French Dip that was divine and they have daily fresh baked cookies that are to die for.
Prices are okay, service was fine, place is quite big and did not take long to bring our food. 
I can't wait to go back and try different things from their menu. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I love Rusty's! It is a great place to indulge in all your favorite greasy food items.  For newbies - you order at the front beside the wall menu and then walk over to your left to pay and get your drink.  I always order the cheesesteak and fries but have heard great things about their burgers.  Their cheesesteak is probably my favorite in Charlotte. They also have healthier options like salads and grilled chicken."}
{"text":"I love these people.  Customer service on point. Food perfect every time. Always a very clean environment. Never a bad day. I eat here 2 to 3 times a week. I take my boys here rather than McDonald's at half the price. My family is important to me. So is what food goes in their bodies. My 15 year old attends south mech high school. He see the difference in customer service and quality of food. I want my children to chose better than lesser, even if price is more."}
{"text":"We tried Rusty's on a Sunday amidst our movies spree in the near by amc.  We dint want to go to any of the big chains so choose Rusty's.  Well, glad we did.  This is super cute place with some old charm.  Right when you enter inside, you get the feel like, yes the food is gonna be good, just because of the ambience.  
Ordered a grilled chicken and chicken club sandwiches with fries and we just wiped the plates off in seconds.
Its just your usual, normal sandwiches but with real good quality products.  Not too cheesy or greasy.  Service was great, the people were awesome and down to earth.  Prices are great, it is located in a strip mall and so no parking problems."}
{"text":"Just tried their black bean burger. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Usually a lot of families. Food is OK but nothing blew me away. The menu is pretty typical American fare (burgers, sandwiches, salads). This is a good lunch/quick dinner spot, but don't expect to be impressed."}
{"text":"If i could give rusty's 100 out of 5 stars i would! 
I could go here every night, the food and atmosphere is wonderful! 
I really recommend the chicken salad sandwich, or the bacon and cheese potato. 

AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat. Best roast beef in the state. Very fresh tasty Thurman's. I have been eating here for over 15 years. Love it. Fresh crisp fries!!!  I would eat here everyday if I could. Good price sandwich is full of meat and lot of fries.  Also awesome fresh cookies"}
{"text":"For 20 years, this South Charlotte deli/grille, nestled among the ever-changing stores at Quail Corners Shopping Center, has served up the area's best Angus burgers and corned beef Reubens. Except for its prices, it is amazing how little has changed over that time. Equally amazing is how often it is ignored by the media when the city's best burgers are rated. We regulars don't care though, it's already crowded enough.

You order at the front counter after perusing the menu choices on the wall to your right. You then proceed around the corner and grab your drink then move on to pay. Within minutes your meal is enthusiastically delivered piping hot to your table in its narrow alley-like eating area. Fries are simple yet fabulous as are all of its sides. Even its cookies are pretty darned good.

Back to the burgers though... long time locals know them for what they are, the absolute best burgers in the area. Served up simply, on a buttered then grilled bun, they focus on what matters most which is the Angus beef.

The Rubens and cheese steak Hoagies are served up just as simply and honestly. Crushed ice sodas only enhance the experience. 

Service is friendly and hustles to get your food to you hot and tasty.The joint is always clean and well managed. Is it a five star joint amongst comprable daily grills? You bet it is! It's also a Gotta Try, but when you discover that it is all I say it is, do me a favor and keep it to yourself."}
{"text":"Right down the road from us, we go all the time. Great burgers and the reuben my wife gets always looks tasty. Tons of (great) fries, one order is prob enough. Friendly people too."}
{"text":"Just an overall great little place for a solid burger, chicken sandwich, fries. I've never had a bad meal here. The service is friendly. This place has become part of our rotation."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and is a great lunch spot.  Their chicken caesar wrap is delicious....I hardly ever get anything else!  Watch out for the long line at prime time on the weekends, it can run out the door.  Lots of specialty drinks and beers to choose from - and a nice patio to enjoy them on!"}
{"text":"Good chicken salad, but wheat bread was ordinary.  Other sandwiches looked decent as well."}
{"text":"The food is super fresh and taste amazing! The staff is very friendly and though the place looks dated, it is spotless! I would eat here any day!"}
{"text":"Oh man. So so SO YUMMY. Highly recommend the chicken philly. The fries are addictive and the homemade ranch dressing is incomparable. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"First time trying Rusty's. It's a little confusing at first. I walked in expecting an experience to Hickory Tavern, but that wasn't the case. It's got a bit more of a fast food atmosphere. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was dinner time and close to closing so it was bustling. They had no trouble finding me outside (probably because not many people were there). I ordered a burger without the Mayo and it out hot and juicy with a fresh, ripe tomato slice and large piece of lettuce on top. I definitely recommend Rusty's if you're looking for a good burger but don't want to spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"Very easy to pass by and not think twice of, as I've done for years! Live down the street and was craving a burger besides fast food. I jumped on Yelp and it had great reviews! Nothing fancy inside, but the burger was great! Again, nothing fancy, but sometimes a burger is better off just the old fashioned way without all the fancy stuff. Classic steak fries great as well. My go to from now on for my burger indulgence."}
{"text":"Rustys is legit- one of the favorite local places around here to get a burger and fries. Really popular with all the nearby highschool kids from South Meck and for good reason- it's great food at a fair price. Would definitely recommend it to anyone that asked me for a great burger, my personal favorite being their bacon cheeseburger. Has a hole-in-the-wall atmosphere to it and is family owned, something that is becoming too rare of a thing nowadays"}
{"text":"I have driven by Rusty's several times and always wondered what the food was like- now I know. I read the reviews on Yelp like I always do and they were mixed. But I figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing. Plus, I wanted something different from my usual Subway. Anyway first off thee decor is a bit off putting because its like the house of mirrors. Some of the other reviewers said this was a Charlotte institution, but I haven't been here long enough to know that. I just know they need to change the inside because it's a bit creepy. So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross.  The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either.  The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias. I can say I probably won't go there again and I should have just gone to Subway. Take it or leave it."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. I come here 2-3 times a week. Philly cheese steak and burgers"}
{"text":"Food is great. They are still challenged service wise. Called in the order but had to stand in line for 10 minutes to pay. Young female blond employee was outside talking when I got arrived and came back in 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"We eat here on a semi-regular basis and over the years have NEVER been disappointed.  Love the cheesteak sandwiches and the grilled tuna, which some may consider a bit pricey for a sandwich, but it's the size of a small filet mignon and always tender and gently seasoned.   Add a side of their generous portions of fries, enough for two (order extra crispy) and you have a very filling and quick meal served by friendly folks."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Rusty's once a week since we moved to Charlotte last year. The Chili is great... It tastes homemade and a must try!!  I would highly recommend eating at Rusty's!"}
{"text":"Started a new job recently and apparently I was the only one that had not been to Rusty's yet. I finally got a chance this past week. I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back. I was kinda in a hurry so I took my order to go. 

It's definitely a hole in the wall type place as other reviews have said,but don't let the outside fool you. Inside is clean and well taken care of. It quickly filled up as I was waiting for my food so this definitely was a very popular place. Their menu consists of hot and cold sandwiches, soups and salads. I ended up with the Carolina Club and a cup of cream of broccoli soup. 

After you order you walk around, grab a drink and then pay for your food. It flowed very well. Custom service was fine and they were very accommodating to a first timer lol. 

My food was really good. Nice ratio of meat to bread. I have to make a special comment about the bacon. It was cooked perfectly. thick cut and cooked to crispy but not burnt. Soup was good as well.  Well seasoned and a thick soup as a creamed soup should be. There are definitely other things on this menu that I would like to try. I will say that the 5-10 customers behind me had one of two sandwiches, a phillysteak of some sort or the meatball sandwich. I will be back to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at this deli! The people are awesome! We eat Philly cheese steaks, chicken salad, chili, loaded cheeseburgers, and Ruebens, club sandwiches .
All favorites! It is better to visit at not prime time for lunch - 12:00 unless placing a curb side to go order.
 The owners and employees wotk so hard to make this deli A++. Thank you Rusty's! Reasonably priced and pure quality. Yes! It's that good. My husband and I have date night there often."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT if you're looking for a tasty, quick lunch like a sandwich, burger, or salad. I've been here twice so far. The service is real quick, the food is delicious, and the staff are friendly. Everything is convenient. Fountain drinks are self-served as well as some of the sides (such as pasta salads, fruit cups, etc). Haven't eaten inside yet but I would like to some time, because the place is nice and cozy. A bit short on space, but the interior decor is fun and a good place to eat with a couple other friends. The only thing I'd say is that there isn't a whole lot of variety on toppings for a sandwich or burger, usually just lettuce and tomato. Pretty typical stuff, nothing really \"Rusty-unique.\" But...maybe I just don't know yet, need to visit more!"}
{"text":"Best philly cheese steak I have come across in Charlotte. If you want an easy, delicious sub, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I eat here pretty often. The meatball sub hits the spot for me and my friend swears by the black bean burger."}
{"text":"Tucked away In a shopping center, it was a real treat. You stand in line to order but the menu is large and easy to see so it's no problem. There are a lot of tasty selections to try and everything seems to be alacarte. No big deal, the prices are very reasonable. It has a real deli feel, so don't expect a lot of glam. Just very good food. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The burgers are so fresh and delicious! Lots of options and the staff is great you really get a sense of the community. My friends and I always go !"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in this part of charlotte I stop for a bite a rusty's. Everything is delicious and prices are fair."}
{"text":"They need to change their name and drop the deli part. I should have read the reviews and gotten a burger instead. 

I ordered a simple hot pastrami on rye. I am not exaggerating when I say 1/2 of the sandwich had 3 small pieces of pastrami. The other 1/2 barely had more. The rye bread was good but greasy. 

Not at all what a sandwich should be if you call your place a deli."}
{"text":"Always amazing! Best burger and Chicken Salad ever! Consistently delicious for many many years now!"}
{"text":"Still a go-to spot when wanting some comfort food (think Reuben, cheeseburger, fries, Philly cheesesteak...) at an affordable price in a classic Charlotte hole-in-the-wall restaurant."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the staff really gets it done!  They have limited seating but they move them in and out very quickly all while handling large daily take out orders.
Too bad they are not open 24/7!  
If you ever go there, try not to be stupid and realize that other people would like to sit and eat too.  Be courteous and get in and out in a timely manner.  
Great sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Went here today for a late lunch with out of town guests wanting burgers! It was a little crowded due to limited seating, but the wait wasn't long for our food. 

I had the South Charlotte Cheesesteak and it was great! Fully loaded with lettuce, provolone, tomatoes and mayo with a pickle spear - I hated to eat the last bite it was so good! I got pasta salad on the side which was flavorless and soaked in oil and a double chocolate cookie which was a yummy end to my meal!

My guests got a tuna burger and a cheese, bacon, mushroom burger with a side of fries. I can't vouch for the taste of those, but they ate it all, along with a slice of carrot cake (she said it was great!) and a toffee cookie!

Will definitely return not only for the feel, but the \"little secret gem of Charlotte\" feel the place has to it."}
{"text":"Best customer service, best food. Loooooove the chicken philly and fries with honey mustard.  Soooooooooo good~ Keep doing  what you are doing!!! DONT CHANGE ANYTHING!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1985. This place is consistently delicious. Same menu from the start. The only change it took 15 Years ? to start serving sweet tea. I have tried practically everything from burgers, chicken, phillys and salads. And let's not forget the killer cheesecake and carrot cake...awesome.  Wouldn't change a thing-excellent"}
{"text":"Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful, especially the Carolina Turkey Club."}
{"text":"Looking for a really simple wholesome meal? Look no further. Very nice, clean and friendly spot for lunch. Great food for a good price."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit and I am highly disappointed. I visited on my lunch break and ordered a roast beef/turkey on rye. What I received was just turkey. Since it is virtually impossible for me to drive back and have them to correct the issue (work lunch break), this is the only way I can express how unhappy I am.
They are officially on the back end of my list of best delis."}
{"text":"The burgers here are awesome! Definitely the good old school kind of burger that will make you want to come back again and again (as it did for me!)."}
{"text":"I have been going here since the 80s. They have great roast beef grinders! Saturdays are very busy!! Awkward line for ordering/paying when it does get crowded- making it really tight quarters. But the food is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Man it has been forever since I've been here but I need to go back more often. Saturday lunch it was crazy busy. You walk in and order at the counter, then slide around the corner for chips and a drink and pay. Then they'll give you a number to put on your table. Outside seating is plentiful in the redesigned center and they'll find you anywhere. Burgers and cheesesteaks are excellent!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheesesteak, with the sauteed mushrooms (why would these not be standard on a cheesesteak?).
The meat was in a stack, like Steak-umms, in the middle of the sandwich.  It was so tough that I pulled the entire \"meat stack\" out of the bun when I bit into it.
There was 1/4 lb. of mayonnaise on the sandwich, turning the entire thing into a Slip & Slide, and the bun turned into complete mush after I took 2 bites.  
I do not want to eat a cheesesteak with a fork and knife.  I don't like a sandwich with more mayo than meat, either.  I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"OK, I definitely owe this place a new review since my last one.  This place gives out great quality food.  It's locally owned and is one of the top choices if you are in the area.  You can pick a pickled pepper at the counter that you order at.  Consider it a little appetizer.  I think they are delicious.  

Probably the hottest menu Item is the Bacon Cheese Burger.  Always delicious!  The French fries here are fresh peeled and cut.  No frozen ones here.  I would like the fries a little more if they had the skins on them.  I feel like the clientele they cater to is a skinless type of crowd if you know what I mean.

They do serve bottled beer which is something you do not see at many deli's.  

The staff is always courteous and definitely likes to take care of their customers.  There is a pac-man machine in the back but if you are not careful, it will take your quarter."}
{"text":"Meh.  My black bean burger was good but it came with a lettuce cup on top of the burger filler with salsa? Totally weird.  Place is clean but you walk in and it smells like burned burgers and greasy fries.  Dining area is rather small so not idea for big groups.  

They do serve beer and wine. (Not many local craft beers that I could see and not a great selection of the other type of beers) 

Listen - this is great to grab a burger to go if you are working in the area, but not the best option to actually drive to to go for dinner and actually eat there .  Meh. We had a large party and I was over it by 10 minutes of feeling cramped."}
{"text":"We get burgers here and they are delicious. We also have had the chili cheese fries which are sinful and delicious haha. 

Kind staff and good price point for what you get. I do think its a little weird that you tell them what you ordered when you pay, if they just gave you a carbon copy of your first order to go pay, that would be pretty easy. But it sort of adds to the charm in a weird way! haha 

Give it a try! (PS Closed on Sundays)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - they have a great burger - however my girlfriend found a twist tie in her food so she'll never go back."}
{"text":"Love the food... But Tried their new curbside delivery.. Epic fail. Called 30 minutes before showing up and still waited 10 minutes at the curb for it to come out. And they forgot the condiments we requested."}
{"text":"Rusty's was so good! I found them for a lunch spot and not only did they have a lot of business at that time but they were fast and efficient. The food was priced well and tasted great. The workers were so nice and polite! I will be making this a normal lunch spot from now on!"}
{"text":"If you don't call in your take out order in advance, don't expect to have your food prepared in less than 30 minutes. How long should it take to make a grilled cheese? I won't be returning. As an engineer, I'll give my parting advice: automate the order process. The paper tickets are so 1980's."}
{"text":"I stopped at Rusty's Deli & Grille for lunch on a Saturday because of the reviews here.  Overall I'd recommend Rusty's, but there are better places to eat.  The restaurant is long and narrow and when I came in was very busy.  The ordering system is very convoluted.  You wait in line to order at a window.  The person at the window though was also making sandwiches so there was a wait, about 30 seconds, between each group to order.  The menu board is on the sidewall of the hallway  (parallel to the line) so you can't really see it until you get up to the front of the line to order.  It would have been better to place it above the order window (perpendicular to the line).  And you thought you'd never use geometry after you got out of high school.  Then you head around the corner to the left to another line to get your drinks and place your order again at the cashier and pay.  The layout of the place kind funnels people this way, but why do I have to order twice?  Maybe this is so they can start working on your order and have it ready when you go to pay.  I was lucky to grab a table as I witnessed several parties hovering nearby looking for a place to sit.  If you have more than two people in your party I recommend that after make your first order you send someone to snag  a table while the other goes to pay.  I ordered a cheese steak sandwich and fries.  It took a while to get my food.  You would think they would have started working on it when I first placed my order, but that was not the case.  With the volume of people in the place I anticipated a wait, but it seemed to take longer than it should to get my food.  The cheese steak sandwich was OK, nothing special, but it was hot off the grill.  I should have known not to expect too much when the menu said it came with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Toppings that are fine for a burger but that should never be mentioned in the same sentence as a cheese steak.  I left them off of my cheese steak.  The fries on the other hand were great.  They were thick cut, hot & crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Overall nothing spectacular, the fries come close, but good hot food.  The tab came to $10.46 for sandwich, fries and drink, which is not too unreasonable."}
{"text":"I lived in this general area for about 5 years or so and meant to go to Rusty's but never got around to it. I've been out for over a year now and happened to be nearby. I finally stopped and I am glad I did.

I thought it was gonna be just another boring restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised when the first two things to welcome me were a community board and the cooler with a passable craft beer selection.

We grabbed a couple of beers, ordered the special (Bacon cheeseburger & fries for $4.99) and sat. Our food came out fast and everyone was very pleasant. I even struck a conversation with the guy who brought my burger about Android phones.

Food was great! The burger had that freshly made look and taste, delicious! The fries were a little dry and could have used more salt but they were good overall.

I really liked the atmosphere, very relaxed and informal. Great little place to spend a Saturday afternoon.

Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Tried to place a to go order and the 5 associates standing around never acknowledged us. We finally said bye and left. We've been here before and it's just not worth mediocre."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened Quail Corners when I was little. This place never disappoints! I'm not big on fries, but I always have to have an order of theirs. You can't go wrong with their Reuben, burgers or pretty much anything that they offer. Don't forget a cookie when you pay at the counter!"}
{"text":"Good deli.  Ordered a Reuben with fries and coke. Price was a little high, I think, but the food was hot and delicious.  A Reuben is one of my all time favorite sandwiches.  There was a good amount of corn beef and sauerkraut.  They ask if you want spicy mustard or thousand island.  I ordered with the thousand island, and quite honestly, I couldn't even tell if there was any on the sandwich--I like a bit more of the thousand island.  The fries, also super hot.  I was not familiar with the order process.  You stand in line to place order at window, but they bring your food out to your table, which I liked.

Overall, OK.  I may try again, but will ask for extra thousand island."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Rustys for years. For a fresh, tasty burger and crisp, delicious french fries, Rustys is the sure bet in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"A nice place for a quick bite to eat. Not fancy somewhere between a delint and a sandwich place. Soups, sandwiches. the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Not only the best French Dip in town, the best people and customer service you could ask for. Thank you Rusty's for helping me put a smile on someone's face all the way from New York."}
{"text":"My boss treated us to lunch here. Not that making a club sandwich is rocket science, but this was probably the best one I've had, paired up with good fries and awesome chili."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot. A nice selection and great service. We enjoyed the turkey club, which included great crisp bacon, and the grilled cheese with tomato & bacon, and fries. The sandwiches were great , and the fries hot and cooked to order. The place was packed and now I know why."}
{"text":"Rustys one of the best deli and grille that you can find in Charlotte. Today I had the Rusty's cheeseburger and it was the best cheeseburger I've had in a long time. The fries were amazing as well. The place was slammed pack but the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Lunch with Mrs. K. who really wanted a New York Jewish deli but we didn't want to drive all the way to Arboretum today. Instead, we headed to Rusty's. Sandwiches and other platters, nothing quite \"New York\" style.

I chose the Turkey Reuben. Grilled and topped with sauerkraut the way Reubens are supposed to be but the amount of turkey in there just didn't meet (meat?) my expectations.

Mrs. chose the \"mixed cheese baked potato\". Lots and lots of cheese on here and the potato was nice and fluffy but WOW was it hotter than Hades.

Overall, pretty good. I think the Reuben is better at Katz's though."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the early 90's. If you read a review lower than 4 stars than they don't know good food. Nothing here is less than delicious. Best chicken salad you'll find anywhere. Chicken Philly, the Philly, the Reuben, French dip, chicken cordon blue, Chicken club, burgers, etc... Are the best. My must have when I return home to visit my mom. Born and raised boy from the QC and can't think of any place more local. Shut up and go!"}
{"text":"Pretty overrated deli . Sandwiches are small and sides not great . Fries are awful . Very good service so that's a positive"}
{"text":"WORST LUNCH EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  A little crowded but took an hour and came out wrong. Archaic (twice) handwritten order system and no managerial oversight. Owners must suck every dime out of the business.  No empathy whatsoever about the situation.  Will never return."}
{"text":"So I came here to try the rueben which came highly-recommended from some other Yelpers.  

From the looks of the inside, this place has been here for a while.  You go in and straight ahead of you is where someone takes your order.  Then you go around a corner grab your drink, get a number and pay.  Grab a seat and someone will bring out your order.

I sat outside and shortly after a friendly girl brought out my food.   I tried the reuben with mustard with fries and drink.  The sandwich was just ok to me.  There was too much mustard on it and the bread was quite greasy.  The fries were a light golden color but the taste was blah.  They were soft and mushy inside.  Only Ketchup could save them.

So maybe I should come here and try something else but my search for a good rueben in Charlotte will continue."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and great for casual American fare. The staff is pretty friendly too! Great burgers, cheese steaks, and fries. The fries are a highlight."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They brought us the food and then said they made a mistake and needed $3 more dollars. We didn't think that was right so the manager came by, collected the food, threw it all away, and refunded our entire order. No apology for the confusion, just rude. Will not be going back. We have been a few times before and the food was good but this experience ruined it for us."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich. I gave 3 stars only because I drove 45 minutes to try their sandwich. The sandwich while tasty did not impress me to worth the long drive."}
{"text":"Love everything here. Delicious Rueben, great burgers, chicken salad is good. I also love the toffee cookies they make. Only caution is when they get full it can be a bit of a wait for food but it's worth it."}
