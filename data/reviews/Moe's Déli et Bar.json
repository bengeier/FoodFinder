{"text":"Excellent smoke meat (40 years experience eating the stuff at bens, dunns, Swartz and Rubens ).  Good value for money when considering being in an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was bad. I got the spaghetti with meat sauce topped with slices of smoked meat. The pasta was overcooked. The meat sauce felt canned had a mealy texture in your mouth. The smoked meet tasted like boiled pieces of ham with a pepper crust.

One good thing it had going for it though was the speed. They are very aware that people are strapped for time at the airport, so the service is super fast and the dish came out pretty quickly, at the expense of its taste.

The prices were relatively reasonable for airport prices."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service.   I've tried it out twice.  Once for breakfast another time lunch.  Just say no and get a sandwich at one of the other places.  Eggs were overcooked first time and this time fries were cold and stale.  Not to mention the slow and unfriendly service."}
{"text":"I just had the Montreal burger.  It was the driest beef burger I've had in a long time. Way over cooked. There was no flavor to the meat so I added ketchup and mustard.

The gravy in my poutine was tasteless. The only good thing was the cheese.  I love poutine so I was pretty disappointed.  I also noticed that the girl sitting close to me made a comment about her poutine and was given a new one.

I've had great Quebecois food in the past and this was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I flew in from Moncton and had a four hour wait between connecting flights thanks to Air Canada who saw fit to cancel the later Moncton to Montreal flight, which I had originally booked. Point being, I decided to eat rather than wait until I touched down in Toronto, an error in judgement on my part.

I have low expectations of airport restaurants in terms of the quality of food and value for money, yet Moe's managed to lower the bar further. 

I ordered the smoked meat platter which consisted of a steaming pile of unusually salty, rubbery smoked meat, bland freezer fries, a slice of pickle and a few slices of rye bread on a side plate. With a Ginger Ale, tax, and tip, the total was $22.22. A sandwich and tea combo at Timmie's for about $8 would have been a way better eating experience and value for money.

The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Slowest service in an airport. Lots of staff not doing a lot. Meat was decent. Good taste. French Frys had been under the heat lamp for a while. If you want to waist time it is your place. Getting the bill can take 15min so get it when you get your food!"}
{"text":"This place robbed us - as in, actually took money from us that wasn't theirs and didn't give it back. Without going into all the tedious details, we ordered a special from the drink menu that was supposed to cost a certain amount, and they charged us as if the special didn't exist. It wasn't a big deal at all - we explained the error to our waitress after we got our bill and asked her to correct it. Then she said she agreed with us, but couldn't make the change because she didn't know how to use the computer. We asked to see the manager and he never came after we waited for 15+ minutes. In the end we had to run and get our flight, and were forced to over pay.

The money wasn't the issue - it was only a few dollars difference in the end - it was the fact that they knew they overcharged us, admitted we were correct, and just didn't do anything about it. Why couldn't our waitress fix the error and give us a new cheque like in any other functional restaurant in the world? I'm wondering if the manager didn't show up on purpose, knowing customers are in a rush to catch flights and will eventually have to leave. 

It honestly felt criminal and personally degrading. We're going to follow up with any authorities that might be able to do something about this, and I encourage everyone to watch out for similar behaviour when they eat there."}
{"text":"I ate at Moes on the way home from a business trip.

The service was efficient and moderately friendly. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about. I had an omelette, which was OK. For what I got the price was pretty high, but factoring in the airport premium it was still reasonable.

If you eat there I would recommend that you pay in cash. I noted a slightly higher charge on my credit card account than what I signed for.

Next time at YUL I'll go to Timmy instead, I guess."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my layover to Quebec City expecting a quick and pleasant service considering the seating portion of the restaurant was not full at all. I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar but when I responded I wanted to sit at a table, I was greater with a sure whatever, and a strange Ya Ya Ya....to which two other guests found bizarre and laughed at this.
After sitting I found the waitress to be non-friendly, or welcoming. She forgot my coke, forgot to give me utensils, when I asked what burger is the best I was given a cold and \"hurry the hell up\" reaction of \"they are all good\". I'm not sure why she was in a rush since she had a maximum of 4 other tables.
The icing on the cake is watching her wipe her nose on her hand 3 times until she walked behind the bar....blew her nose in the corner.....used the blue bar cloth to wipe her hands off.....then, proceeded to wipe the counter with it after.
The burger was crap, the soup was old and overcooked, waste of not only my money but of my patience. I will never stop again 

Worst staff experience I've had in over 10 years"}
{"text":"Breakfast is not very good. The potatoes are old and soggy. Sausages were dry.  I would not experiment too much here as they can't even get breakfast right."}
{"text":"Great spot! Lots of food, service was okay the servers are too busy and don't have a lot of time, they simply have to \"get it done\""}
{"text":"The kind of breakfast you should expect from a cheap hotel buffet. Powdered eggs and crepes with a side of tasty taters. Plus the coffee tastes like... Well it's tasteless.
Service reminds me of Canadian Tire."}
{"text":"There's no excuse for fake bacon bits on a salad, soggy un-toasted white bread for a smoked meat sandwich, or dry overdone chicken fingers. This food was simply bad.

If you're waiting for a flight, go for a pre-made sandwich for a fraction of the price at one of the cafes. For our experience, Moe's was expensive and extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Don't go for breakfast.  Slow.  Staff spends more time chatting with each other than taking care of customers.   Ordered breakfast. Had about half hour to catch flight. Paid.   Waited 20 minutes than they came black and told me they were out of something.  I sa there and watched three meals sit for 10 minutes before someone picked them up.  Horrible.   But as they say.  What choice do u have."}
{"text":"I only went because it was near my gate. There are many other options that look way better / less expensive than this place. Service was okay- I recommend that you just stop in for an $18 glass of Chardonnay and get the heck out. Yes, $18. And that's the low-end one."}
{"text":"The restaurant was half empty with tons of staff working but it still took 15 to 20 minutes to come even ask what I wanted for a drink. From there they managed to get my order wrong and bring out French onion soup that was burnt to a crisp on the top. The burger was so cold the cheese didn't even pretend to try to melt. After getting my food and despite several attempts to get some bodies attention it was 45 minutes before I could even ask for a refill on my drink but at that point I just asked for my bill instead. The bill took another 10 minutes to come and in anticipation I had cash out ready to pay. Unfortunately the waitress just dropped the bill acknowledging I wanted to pay then went to clear several other tables and serve somebody else their food before returning entirely unprepared 5 minutes later. Do yourself a favour and get a sandwich at Tim Hortons or Starbucks as the food is better and the service... Well you actually get service. I am on my way there now to get another drink since I never got my refill."}
{"text":"Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport.
Outbound flight back to NYC.
No other place to eat.
Terminal full of tired parties and strippers.
Regular airport/bar food like fish and chips.
Extra time to wait for soda refill.
All the sunlight in the patron eyes.
Lack of attentive service."}
{"text":"Try coming here at 7 am. You'll get friendly service, fresh orange juice, and a delicious breakfast. 

I had the eggs Benedict and they subbed tomatoes instead of meat with no problem. The eggs were perfectly done!"}
{"text":"food is ok. but if your getting take out be prepared to be waiting by entrance until it's ready 10 min usually. for some reason they don't allow you to sit and wait inside if your getting take out."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews were so bad!!  Their smoked meat was DELISH!  Slightly expensive for airport food but I can tell why after seeing the quality.  I had the smoke meat with spaghetti, and it was so perfect.  Server was great and timely.  Asked if we were departing.  I'd def come here again."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast before and I've been here for lunch.  The service is ok I can't say I have any complaints about the service or the amount of time it takes to get seated.

This time around I had ordered the Moe's club sandwich which is a Montreal smoked sandwich with bacon and lettuce, tomato etc.  The fries that came with it weren't that great and the sandwich was just ok.  I had wished the bacon was cooked a little more.  

This place is one of the few sit down places in the airport so as far as choices go it's just one of the few.  As far as having a beer at a sit down place it's the only one I know but it's not like I've been throughout the YUL airport either.  

This place I suppose gets by on the fact that they are one of if not the only place that you can get a sit down meal served to you in the airport hence it is packed regardless of the quality of the food.  

There are much better places in Montreal that I had experienced on this 3 night trip alone.  It's a shame the one leaving town has to be one of the lesser quality meals."}
{"text":"It was really bad! My steak tasted as if it was rotten. The fries were at ?east 2 days old and in addition to all this the meals were all over-expensive."}
{"text":"Service is so bad. All the girls look like their dog died, car broke down and b/f left. Get another job if service isn't your thing. At least try.  If I was MOE I would change my name."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and fries here to-go at Moe's while we had a layover at Montreal airport. Menu is large and gives you a lot of options.  Service was pretty regular as I didn't have my meal within the confines of the restaurant. 

Fries were ok, burger was pretty bland and needed some salt.  Only thing good was that they cooked it and was ready between 5-10 minutes so I didn't have to wait too long.  Would probably try something else if I were at this airport waiting for my flight."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Montreal on my way to Calgary. We had a smoked meat sandwich ($12), a Canadian specialty that roughly translates to a corned beef on rye. Except the rye was lightly toasted. The meat was stacked high and tasted great. The Bloody Marys favored by my traveling companion and I were very odd. The outside of the glasses were caked in salt, and some of the salt must have lept into my drink because the bottom 1/3rd of the glass was not drinkable. Quel Dommage ! (what a pity). I did have the opportunity to dust off my High School French when I orderd \"la meme chose\"  (the same thing) as my buddy did- that was pretty cool and won me admiring stars from my traveling companions. I'll have to post the photos later, some kind of a network issue up here.....

The place was pretty crowded for lunch, but considering we WERE in an airport (where people may be rushed to make a connection?) service was on the slow side."}
{"text":"If you have an hour or more before your flight, this is a great place to eat. 

But be aware, they have a tendency to add extra charges to your bill. This is the second time this had happened to me.

The food this morning was awesome except that the waitress completely screwed up the order and the bill again.
I also waited almost 25 mins for the meal to come.
I ordered sausage and eggs which in the menu says 11.00 I got a bill for 24.00 more than double!

It turns out the guy beside me ordered something similar about 10 mins after I did so I got some of his order on my plate as he ordered his with smoked meat.

I asked simply for coffee, Sausage and eggs sunny up and rye toast. I got that plus smoked meat I never asked for.

When I questioned the bill I was also in a rush so she gave me 5 something back in cash (I paid via card) and she told me that's all she can do.

Wow really?

If your in a hurry don't eat here as I said.  You may be doing some argueing over the bill last minute."}
{"text":"Why would you eggs Benedict on menu and you do not prepare poached eggs?   Another bad airport restaurant!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the airport hungry. I was excited to spot Moe's because I had heard of its good reputation in Montreal.

After my party was seated and the menus tossed on the table, we were left to wait and wait and wait. Servers passed by. We closed the menus to let them know that we were ready to order. Nothing. More waiting. Nothing. Flight to catch. Nothing.

Finally, after overcoming the embarrassment of marching out of the place defeated in our attempts to be served, we decided to leave. No one looked up or even seemed to notice.

It is sad when places with good reputations expand too much or overextend themselves to the point of blatant disregard of customers. When it comes to Moe's... Never again."}
{"text":"In the valley of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. 

Virtually everything is $ 12 or more. 

Fish & chips plus tip plus taxes is $ 18. And the fries were cold. 

I sent the dried out and tasteless chicken wings back. .

Montréal should sue them for their Montréal Smoked Meat, tasteless pile of rubbery stuff. 

Thanks but you'll be better off with a bowl of chile from Timmy's

Between June and December 2012 I flew out of Trudeau airport 23 times. About 18-20 times I ate at this place only because I was on expenses and it was the only place to sit down and eat (I had unfortunately blocked Timmy's from my mind)"}
{"text":"Oh dear.

See those two stars up there? Those are for the stiff level of my cosmopolitan, which, I might point out, was served to me in a juice glass. Want more? I certainly did.

All I wanted was mashed potatoes, but Moe's doesn't have those on their menu. I compromised and decided to get their grilled chicken breast with a baked potato instead. Unfortunately, my waiter informed me that they were out of potatoes. Also spaghetti. Well, ok then.

I decided to just go with a Caesar salad with chicken on top. I did not have high hopes, but at least I would have veggies and protein to keep my body going. I continued to drink out of my hopelessly incorrect glassware while I waited for my meal. 

It eventually came and I instantly knew this would be a chore to eat. The lettuce was plentiful, which is pretty much the only nice thing I can say. The sauce was obviously bottled, and the chicken was in rubberized strips. I managed to eat half of them (the better half) before giving up and pushing them to the side. You would also think that a sixteen dollar salad would come with real bacon, wouldn't you? Haha! Think again!

The bizarre ending to this meal of mediocrity? The waiter dropping by to slide Moist Towelettes across the table to me. I swear to you, this happened. Moist Towelettes for a Caesar salad. Two of them!

Pity we who fly domestic in this airport. This is the only sit-down restaurant we have."}
{"text":"Yea it's airport food so there isn't much to say. However, I am one of those travelers that must eat and drink in a restaurant before boarding a plane. Dining before flying eases my stress by preparing my stomach and brain for coma mode.

After dining here, my boyfriend quickly pointed out that our veggie pizza tasted like thawed tomatoes and broccoli spread across Ritz crackers. I pretty much agreed. The drinks were also watered down, and around $10 a pop.

The staff was friendly so that warrants at least one star. Also, I am adding another because theoretically I would visit again if in the vicinity. Don't judge. The options are so limited!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this place was total crap! The food quality was a 2 outta 10 & the end product was just as bad. I ordered the \"Famous Moe's Club\". It came with fries & coleslaw/pickle combo. The fries were cold, the bread was soggy, the \"bacon\" on the club consisted of around 1 piece TOTAL that was all lumped together & the chicken was pathetic!! 

What the hell is that??? If your gonna run a restaurant & have a captive airport customer & WAY overcharge...at least have the decency to turn out an edible meal!! Listen up Pierre Trudeau Airport...its NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE to serve crap food!!"}
{"text":"Haha. My first stop in Montreal and it feels like I'm being fed from a soup kitchen. Avoid this place, it's a convenience trap. I had a classic 2 egg breakfast, marked up for about 200% of its value, for no added value. Blahhhhh"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Moe's Deli & Bar (it's after you've gone through Security).

It was fairly busy.   I sat by the window and watched the planes take off and a snowplow.

I ordered Moe's Club Sandwich with smoked meat.  It was yummy!  I'd ordered it with no lettuce or cole slaw ... but it came with them so I pulled them off and put them on the corner of my table.  My server left it there for a long long time, even after he took my plate away ... he finally took them away just before I left.

The food was good ... the service not so much.  It was efficient but I felt like I was being rushed out."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of choices when you're waiting for a domestic flight at Montreal's Airport. Moe's isn't bad -- it's all pretty much fried bar food, but the friendly staff make it better.  The chicken fingers were quite tasty but the french fries were cold and rather repulsive. It's a convenient place to sit down and wait, though!"}
{"text":"I think maybe having a captive audience plus no repeat customers has meant Moe's can fall flat on its face with no repercussions. We had a cheeseburger and fries and a smoked meat sandwich and fries, and surprise surprise - it was kind of gross airport food! Lucky for Moe, his joint's inside the security checkpoint. We should have gone to the Burger King before getting frisked and x-rayed - we would have saved about $30! Service was flawless and it was packed, so we tipped heavily."}
{"text":"as mentioned this is one of the places to eat after clearing security for domestic and transfer border travel.   I stopped in today for breakfast and wow not a great start,  both knives on the table had caked on food..  see picture.   service is good and food is as expected.   this place is better for a snack and a couple beers in the afternoon.   If your looking for good food eat before you get to the airport..  otherwise this will do.   prices are not as crazy as some airports,  but expect a premium to be added on to prices because your at an airport.

If someone from. This resto reviews this note id say work on the quality control and my future review of this location will improve."}
{"text":"Not a lot of options in this wing of the airport. Thought a deli might have some better quality/healthier options.  We were wrong.  There were very limited salad options. (house salad, Caesar salad, or salad with fish-most likely overcooked).  I opted for the Largo chicken sandwich thinking it sounded decent. The first bad sign was when I wasn't allowed to trade a bun for a baguette even though had it for other sandwiches. The only tea option was sweetened. My boyfriend went for the \"traditional\" smoked meat sandwich which was supposedly similar to pastrami.  In short, the food was crap.  The cheese looked and tasted like plastic.  The meat was some genetically altered glob.  It was one of those meals where you feel disgusting as you're eating, but are so hungry that you have to have a few more bites."}
{"text":"Petit déjeuner à l'aéroport avant d'embarquer.... Les toasts de pains arrivent dans l'assiette déjà pré-beurrés si bien qu'on ne sait pas trop si c'est de l'huile, de la margarine ou du beurre...L'omelette, jaune vitrifiée a un aspect plastifié/vinyle très tendance, le côté caoutchouteux en bouche ne vous laissera pas indifférent non plus...Enfin le service est d'une lenteur à mourir.
Bref n'y allez pas si vous avez un avion à prendre ;-)"}
{"text":"J'arrive souvent dans les aéroports bien en avance dans l'idée de prendre le temps de manger ou prendre un verre avant de décoller, mais c'est rare que j'aie le temps. À ma dernière visite, j'ai finalement eu le temps de me prendre un bon Caesar avant de partir. Le serveur était super, super, super de bonne humeur et social. En voyant que certains des gens autour de nous étaient au resto à cause de retards dans leurs vols, et qui étaient donc de mauvaise humeur, c'est assez admirable de voir que le serveur n'a jamais perdu le sourire et prenait le temps de jaser avec les gens pour entendre leur frustration. Côté cocktail, avoir su j'aurais pris un double, mais le niveau d'épice de mon Caesar était parfait! Pour mes quesadillas ils étaient très bons aussi, du genre de ce qu'on retrouve dans un \"sports bar\". Conclusion : une bonne place pour perdre son temps avant d'embarquer dans un avion."}
