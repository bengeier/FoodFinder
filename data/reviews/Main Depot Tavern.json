{"text":"The Main Depot is a wonderful spot to hit up before, during or after a nearby Kohl Center event. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The staff is always available to offer up a wise ass remark. While the food menu is somewhat limited, the fare served is pleasing to both the belly and the pocketbook. Oh, and the beverages? Steady as she goes, sir! No short pours in these drinks! Stop in anytime for some genuine East Side hospitality. Yes. I know where it's located. The owners and much of the staff are all East Side, though."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon to check out the Depot.  Place is nice and the patrons and bartender are quite friendly.  My wife said her old fashioned was great and my beer was fine too.  Just stopped for one drink and really enjoyed the the place.  I recommend the Depot for a stop by anytime."}
{"text":"I love how people call this place a dive. If this is a dive ,then you my friend have never been to a dive. You want a dive, go to the Ohio Tavern or Willy St Pub."}
{"text":"This bar is tucked away on train tracks and not quite what is considered \"downtown.\" But it is the definition of a hidden gem. Mostly a tiny sports bar, you can feel the history here, and you really drink it in...

Food is available, and it's typical bar fare, but just link the drinks, the price is right. They have slot machines, as any classic Wisconsin bar should have. The Long Islands are good, but if the place wants a 5-star rating, they have to upgrade the televisions. Other than that, stop in for any Kohl center event and you won't be disappointed. I don't think it gouges you like any of the Regent bars on football Saturdays, either."}
{"text":"Stopped by The Depot before a Badgers hockey game. Great spot for some wings and a beer on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and this place already feels like home. The bartenders and patrons are friendly and local. A bit divey but reasonably priced and a good atmosphere. The cheese curds are great! Will definitely be frequenting this establishment! :)"}
{"text":"Great service, good price and friendly people.  Yummy cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and decided to stop by for lunch on Saturday around 12:30pm. The door was locked, lights were off and chairs were still on the tables... not sure why they were not open during their regular business hours!"}
{"text":"Classic Wisconsin dive bar with great bartenders. Good drink prices and a great alternative to the echo tap where you glow under the light of 40 flat screen tv's. Tavern food is pretty solid. Try a tropical bomb."}
{"text":"I have an affinity for dive bars. Actually, more like an obsession with them.

I love the Caribou, a wonderful dive off of East Johnson. Echo Tap used to be great until they renovated, jacked up their prices, and became infested by Epic employees (to my friends who work at Epic--no offense. Really. I love you guys).

Main Depot sits about a block and a half away from Echo Tap. It's small. It's divey. It's got darts and pool. Travis, the owner/bartender, is pretty awesome. When we order pitchers, we never have any idea what price we'll pay, but we know it'll be reasonable.

Now, in traditional Yelp/foodie sense, there's one thing that truly sets Main Depot apart from other dives: their cheese curds. They're cheap ($4), fresh, and honestly? Absolutely delicious. In fact, I'd go so far as to put them up with some of Madison's best noms! Very crunch, delicious outside and an overly-gooey, cheddar inside. Oy, what a combination! The Old Fashioned and Graze have always been my curd metric, but with Main Depot, you are simply getting one hell of a bang for you buck. 

Oh, and the atmosphere after games? Totally awesome...and filled with townies! I love townies.

Go there for the curds, stay for the fun. It's one gem of a dive."}
{"text":"This has been the closest place to my house for two years and I finally went inside. Unfortunately it was later than usual but they still had the fryers on. On the recommendation of the entirety of yelp I tried the cheese curds and I also threw an order of chicken strips on there because I'm a huge person. The curds were great, crispy outside, warm gooey cheddary cheesy inside, and served with a side of ranch. While I was beyond satisfied with the curds the chicken strips were just run of the mill Sysco strips, which isn't a criticism, but the order only came with like two pieces which I found scant and is somewhat of a criticism. Great prices though so no actual true complaints, I got outta there with two food items and one beer for less than 15 bucks. For a run of the mill dive this place wasn't bad and the bartender was a nice dude but I'll keep my regular status at Echo Tap for better food, more selection, and the faces I know best! Thanks for having me MD!"}
{"text":"As I get older, I appreciate certain things more.  One of these things is a good bar burger. 
I stopped in on a whim during lunch.  Admittedly, I only have been here at night and usually at the end of the night so my memory was a bit hazy.
The Main Depot is a simple bar doing simple things.  And that isn't a slam.  Often, places try to hard to be something their not.  Not here.  You can leave your pretenses at the door.  
The beer selection is solid with your standard macro beer choices sprinkled with some great craft options (Can you say Karben4 Fantasy Factory?).  The bartenders are quick on the draw and down to earth.  During lunch, you get a sense there are a lot of regulars as they are know many on a first name basis.
For lunch, I went with a bacon cheeseburger with a side of fries.  There is something magical about a burger cooked on a flat top grill.  A hard sear puts a nice crust on the outside while leaving the burger nice and juicy on the inside.  Cheddar, bacon, and fried onions make it complete.
Wisconsin has a long tradition of great taverns and the Main Depot represents them well."}
{"text":"Nice tap list. Good badger bar. Bar food above average. Friendly staff and clientele."}
{"text":"I love this bar. It's super divey but everyone is friendly and the drinks are cheap. What else could you ask for? It's a great time without being too crowded. Take note --cash only!"}
