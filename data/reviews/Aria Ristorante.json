{"text":"This whole experience was just terrible! From the moment we walked in, a lady said our table (which was reserved!!) Was not yet ready..okay fine we had a drink and waited, then the waiter comes over 15 minutes later and says our table has been ready for a while.. The waiter (Kyle) seemed rude and condescending and rushing us the entire time!! Asking us to order our main course with the app's...def felt herded like cattle. Here is the best part. NO DESSERT left in the restaurant. What kind of place is this? I will be taking my money elsewhere in the city for sure."}
{"text":"Since we have the pleasure of dining out fairly frequently one of the things I look for when choosing restaurants during Winterlicious is that they stay true to their standard menu; it really irks me when they use Winterlicous to serve sub-par meals.  Second, if restaurants are going to offer lunch and dinner the menus had better be somewhat different.  I don't mind if there are some crossover dishes, this is to be expected, but if your $35 (or $45, ahem) dinner menu is the exact same as your $25 lunch save for one or two mains I'm certainly not coming for dinner.  I don't understand why some restaurants do this either, Winterlicious is about marketing, bringing people that may not normally dine at your establishment in the door; if you serve me a meal that is below your standards what incentive is that for me to return and pay full price?  None I tell you, and that is why there are very few that get my Winterlicious nod of approval.

We braved the snow last night though for Aria, the modern sister to our favourite neighbourhood spot Noce.  Everything on Aria's Winterlicious menu can be found on their current full a la carte menu.  However, Paul and I decided to order a la carte because neither of us wanted to have dessert (I know, I must have been feeling ill).  We started with the fried calamari stuffed with salt cod served with crispy polenta, oven dried tomatos and crispy sage.  The calamari was perfectly cooked and the crispy polenta was a divine blend of crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth goodness (I wished there were more).  We also shared the wild mushrooms with lemon scented marscapone; unfortunately this fell a little flat, we both felt it was quite salty and the lemon was a bit too overpowering.  I followed with a lovely pumpkin ravioli with brown butter sauce and crispy sage, while hubby had the winter mushroom pappardelle; both very good.

My husband had a half bottle of 2004 Il Borro, a super tuscan blend, he says it was a great accompaniment with the food because the acidity helped balance the richness of his main dish.  As a side note this winery is owned and run by Salvatore Ferragamo, the grandson of the named fashion house.  Speaking on wine, my main complaint about Aria is in regards to their wine list; I'm an off-dry white drinker, partial to riesling in particular, and they don't have one off-dry white period.  Now, in wine circles riesling is a very respected varietal and the finer examples are coveted by sommeliers and serious wine collectors alike.  World renowned wine authority and Master of Wine Jancis Robinson says \"I think that riesling is indisputably the greatest white wine grape in the world....\".   Yet so many Toronto restaurants completely overlook this lovely grape (especially the off-dry offerings), which is a shame because they loose out on my wine dollars.  So to all the restaurants and sommeliers whose wine lists are lacking: I'm not asking you to offer Donhoff or J.J. Pruhm by the glass....but if you had it by the bottle Paul and I would love to share one.

On the design front Aria is a beautiful restaurant with a two story glass wine cellar greeting you as you walk in, two walls of floor to ceiling windows soaring two stories high (one accented with a chain mail curtain) and a warm brown/gold veined white marble bar that stretches almost the entire length of the restaurant.  Floating from the ceiling are huge glittering Moooi pendants in varying sizes but the standout feature is the monumental custom wood sculpture dancing overhead created by Dennis Lin and aptly named Aria.

3 stars this time because of the lack of wine and the very salty appetizer, otherwise a great restaurant.  I will note we've dined here before, last summer, and had a stunning meal with no missteps which I would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Close to being the worse meal I have ever had. I ordered the carbonara, and all I could taste was salt!!!! The pancetta wasn't very tasty either. To fill up I ordered the dessert (which I never do) and it was pretty bad as well. Chocolate brownie with some pears. Not sure if it was because of Winterlicious and they were more focused on those meals, but with so many restaurants to choose from in the downtown core, I won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"I thought Aria was better than most of the other reviewers on here.  It's true that the place feels a little empty at times, but otherwise the atmosphere is trendy.  The food and service was also commendable.  The wine list had a good selection of high quality wines.  I had a salad to start and fish as a main - both were full of flavour with great presentation.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see all the bad reviews on here given a couple of great visits to this place on my end. One was an after work dinner with some colleagues and the other was with my husband for winterlicious. Full disclosure, I would probably not pick an Italian place for a fancy dinner; just a personal preference. This place though has helped change my mind. The food is very good: modern without trying too hard and quite rich. Small portions that really hit the spot. And the fact that they had a strong offering for winterlicious was a nice surprise. Their wine list is very good as well. Nice ambience where the music is not blaring so you can actually have a conversation, imagine that...."}
{"text":"I visited late one Monday evening for dessert (the place was pretty much dead at this time). The atmosphere is relaxing, unique and classy. It was a very pleasant place, slightly pricey. My dessert (Panna cotta delle api) was phenomenal. The waiters are well trained and polite. I'd like to go back and try a full meal here sometime."}
{"text":"Decent service. The food was average! Typical pasta dishes that could be made at home! $$$"}
{"text":"Went here the other day before the NBA rookies game and True North after party with Usher and Gwen Stefani performing.  
Anyhow, the service was really slow even though it wasn't busy at all.  The appetizers took about 20 minutes or so to come (I had some sort of balls - can't remember what they were called but they were yummy but it was a tiny dish). Entrees took around 30 minutes to come but it was ok cause we had some time.  The risotto didn't look very aesthetically pleasing but tasted ok.  Also, had the swordfish which was really bland.

We then ordered dessert which took 45 minutes to come so we were a bit late for the game.  We had the brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top (can't remember the name) and it tasted very average.

For this price point everything should be great.  However, the food here was just average and the service was slow so I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant with a horrible experience. Brought a client to the restaurant, took 2+ hours to get even an appetizer and food. I had the egg frittata, which was bland and overcooked. We had even called in advance of the reservation to have the appetizer ready for us when we got there, but it wasn't. The restaurant wasn't even busy which confused me even more. Restaurant staff weren't particularly friendly. 

I spoke to the manager after the meal (when my client had left) and was told \"they know how to run a top restaurant\" - ya right.

Someone else mentioned it in the review, but walk over to e11even (or even real sports of that matter).  Avoid this place. I'm sure that once more restaurants spring up in the area, Aria is going to be in trouble."}
{"text":"If you're looking for rude service and overpriced meals, aria is the place to go.
Our redhead waitress (she never told us her name) was rude to us as soon as she saw we were two twentysomethings with two teens for a birthday (aka a supposed small tip). She forgot to put our order in for a salad appetizer and told us she was \"surprised it hadn't come out\". When it still showed up on the bill, we asked the manager why. He told us she had told him we ordered the salad after our entrees.. She then \"accidentally\" put in the wrong amount on the machine which included the salad which was supposed to be comped by the manager. Thankfully we were paying attention. Surely she has pulled this move before.
I will never go back to this place and highly discourage anyone from wasting their hard earned money for awful service and average food at best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Nice pre fix menus for summer. Had the calamari salad and pork belly entree- very good! Excellent waitress- think her name was Kelly"}
{"text":"Overall a poor experience.  I've been wanting to go here for a few years now since seeing a review in Toronto Life and I figured Valentine's Day was as a good of a day as any to try it. The restaurant is situated directly in front of the ACC big screen which definitely takes away from the ambiance they are attempting to create.  

Upon first arriving I used the restroom which is situated outside of the restaurant under lock and key.  Considering it's limited access to restaurant attendants and not to those attending the ACC, I wouldn't have expected it to be as completely filthy as a restroom at a concert.  There was water all over the floor, which was also strewn with all of the paper towel, preventing me from being able to dry my hands.

The wine list was somewhat limited in varietals as well as quite overpriced.  Our server also having somewhat of a condescending tone when asking me questions about my preferences for a bottle, but my confusion was due to his poor questioning rather than my lack of wine knowledge.  His attitude seemed to persist throughout our evening, which was the only consistent thing about him.

The meal:

Appetizer
Steak Tartare - Fresh, pleasant but with an over-abundace of lemon

Entrees
Rainbow Trout - A decent entree overall but somewhat bland
Veal Cheeks - Overwhelmingly rich and over-seasoned.  I've had much better.

Desserts 
Bonet Piemontese - Light and airy, chocolate flan-like dessert.  Not bad with a nice compliment of amaretto gelato and caramel 

Olive Oil Cake - The cake was nice and not overly heavy either. It was complimented with mascarpone and lemon curd but I could have done without the candied fruit and micro-basil 

Overall, nothing impressive in comparison to the other excellent Italian restaurants in this city and I won't be coming back nor recommending it.  I feel this was a poor choice for Valentine's Day due to the overall environment, the short Justin Timberlake remix playlist on repeat, poor service and the inadequate food. I would pass."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They should be embrassed to actually serve the food that comes out of their kitchen.  Went there with clients and I'm 99% sure I got food poisoning.  They did not have any of the special we were told about when we arrived.

And the bathroom is not in the restaurant which isn't a big deal but not exactly what I would call classy to bring clients too.

PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious and overall experience in the restaurant was fine until I got food poisoned I think. Had three course of meal: soup, beef cheek and dessert. Everything was fine until in the afternoon my stomach started aching and I had to keep going to washroom. Then I started to have chills and my body temperature went up at night. I did not eat anything  after that three course meal and thus the food poison probably come from their food.I don't think i will ever go back to this restaurant! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Without exaggeration the best food I've ever eaten! Went for a client lunch and had the special braised beef gnocchi - DELISH!!
Great atmosphere and service! I would definitely highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was featured as one of the must-try for their winterlicious menu.
The scallops I had as an appetizer were salty. The scorpion fish pasta (I know why on earth would anyone order something like that) had sand in it and the pasta was under cooked. The best part of the meal was dessert;it was a lemon custard with pop rocks, at least that was somewhat creative.
Overall my experience here was not good at all. I can think of a dozen places where I rather spend my $45"}
{"text":"I went to their summerlicious this Friday with my team and was very underwhelmed. After 3 course meal and $50 spent, I came out hungry and not satisfied. Here are my observations: 

Pros:
1. Good Service 
2. Near workplace 

Cons:
1. Expensive 
2. Very small portions 
3. Very average food. I would rate 5/10
4. Not enough options to pick from."}
{"text":"I tried this place for a birthday dinner and let me tell you that all the positive aspects balances the negative ones. 

Positive: Good looking bar and ambiance. Food didn't actually taste bad. (read below)

Negative: portion sizes are very very small and you end up ordering 3 times as usual if you want to feel full.

We waited a very long time for our food to be served (almost an hour).

Menu is limited and I was lucky to order the special which I had to ask for to see if they happen to have one.

It was kind of difficult to find it and due to its hidden location, you have to check out a key to the bathroom which is outside of the restaurant.

Overall:
won't be going back there anytime soon unless I am meeting up with an escort at the bar and that's literally all."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant ever!! Great food, great service. Had the pork chop and it was delicious. I highly recommend restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was sub-par. I ordered  one of their pastas and it came luke warm. I didn't even finish it, because it tasted so bland and ....lukewarm... NOT worth the calories. Going to an Italian restaurant, you would think everything would be coated in sauce or flavour or herbs - that was just not the case here.  

However, I will give it 2 stars for the decor and the pleasant waiters."}
{"text":"We went to Aria before the NBA All Star Saturday night skills competition. We had the fried stuffed olives as an appetizer which were good. For our meals, we had the sausage risotto and the mushroom ravioli, both of which were amazing! That's where we should have stopped, but we had dessert... We order a tiramisu that was suppose t have a subtle cherry taste, but it had cherries all over it and in it. That was all you could taste and we asked to change it, as it as awful. We had the Nutella brownie with peanut butter ice cream.  The brownie was crunchy and stale. A waste of calories. The restaurant removed the dessert from out bill which was appreciated, but a sad way to end an otherwise great meal! The other weird thing was you have to leave the restaurant to go to the washroom..."}

Good restaurant for food , price ( especially for high quality wine ) and even more for hospitality !! Period"}
{"text":"Not bad...rather expensive for a tiny portion of Duck..."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Aria for this year's Winterlicious. I picked Aria because of the recommendations from many Toronto blogs. I chose the steak tartare, braised veal cheeks and the chocolate bonet dessert. For $45, this is one place you need to head to for Winterlicious.

The veal cheeks were the most tender cheeks I have ever had. A knife was not required for this dish. The cheeks were sitting on top of a potato/pumpkin puree which really enhanced the flavour of the meat. It was my first time having steak tartare and I enjoyed every bite of it. The texture at first can be unusual but as you dig in more, you start to enjoy it more and more.

Since the weather was pretty bad Saturday night, there were no issues with service. The server checked with us regularly and engaged in a friendly conversation about cheeks!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is designed to extract dollars from the unsuspecting basketball fan or wealthy financial professional. The staff are rude and unprofessional, menu prices are exorbitant for the portions received.

On my visit to the restaurant, we arrived with a group of 12. I was tasked with ordering the wine and asked if it was possible to sample the wine before committing to a $75 bottle. The waitress told me \"once it's opened, it's yours\". That's OK, par for the course for some establishments. What I didn't expect was a follow-up statement, \"I've never heard of any restaurants doing that\". Thank you for your insight.

When it came time to order, one of our guests had questions about gluten and dairy restrictions and wanted to know if the chef offered substitutions. The waitress promptly shut him down by saying its not possible and began listing off potential changes to the dish - all of which without actually consulting anyone in the kitchen.

Service issues aside, our food took a whopping 1.5 hrs to arrive from seating to food on table. By which point, the restaurant was half empty. In all fairness, it took 50 minutes to take our orders, and only about 40 minutes to serve our large group.

The food, while delicious, is relatively small with regards to portions. Diners be warned, aria is tolerable for a company outing, but avoid it like the plague if spending your hard earned dollars."}
{"text":"The restaurant was less than half full when I got there. As time went it actually got emptier. I don't know if it's always like that. The wine selection was good. I ordered a risotto for my main meal. It looked like oatmeal! It was tasty though. I had a tiramisu for dessert. It came in a black bowl not a plate. It was pretty strong and I could eat only half of it. Service could have been a little better. One waitress asked me \"are you full?\" when taking my plate away. I was like ?? Overall I expected a little more."}
{"text":"Aria is pure class! Booking was very easy and they understood I had an event to attend and were very aware of giving us the Aria experience and getting us to the event! 
The staff were on point.  Kelly and John saw to our every need.  The food was FANTASTIC in presentation and freshness and taste! The two meals presented were devoured. 
The resturants' ambience is classy-comfortable! 
Looking forward to returning.  John really was a pleasure and I'll be requesting him!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my mother's birthday back in mid-July here.

The setting was quite impressive.  I am afraid that I cannot say the same about the food, most of which was overdosed with oil and, worse, salt. While I realise some of the fried appetizers do come sprinkled with salt, there is a difference between sprinkling and dousing.  The risotto special (with baby zucchini and artichokes) was on the verge of being briny.  Likewise, the steak Fiorentina that I had with my father came with far too much salt, as were the accompanying rapini, which were marred also by an excessive amount of chili pepper.  

Some other observations: the striploin side of the porterhouse steak used to make the \"fiorentina\" contained a noticeable (and unpleasantly chewy!) amount of gristle, which should have been trimmed prior to cooking.  Or perhaps a different porterhouse should have been selected in the first place. The steak also suffered from uneven cooking; though ordered medium rare, as suggested, some parts were closer to well-done, and others were almost raw.  

But the part of the meal which was the most disappointing was the dessert.  All the desserts were excessively sweet and texturally uninteresting.  The Aria pudding was downright mushy.  My guess is that the pastry chef was trying to update a traditional summer pudding, but the result was an unappealing magenta-coloured sludge.  There was nothing remarkable about the pavlova or the polenta brownie.   

We all suffered mild indigestion on the day following the meal.  

A few words on the service.  The server was quite sweet; however, the tempo between courses seriously lagged, particularly later in the evening.  I am all for slow food and in fact do not enjoy being rushed, but the pace between the primo and the secondo and then the dessert was glacially slow. 

An aspect of the evening which struck us as particularly odd was the fact that no one said goodbye to us as we left.   A proper goodbye is a gracious touch, and much-appreciated small gesture.  When it is warm and sincere, it prompts customers to return.  When it is absent, it is difficult to interpret.

A suggestion: a restaurant in the price point of Aria should offer some sort of amuse-bouche (or assaggio, as properly called in Italian) at the start of the meal, and a petit four after the dessert.  The hard candies that accompanied the bill were pretty to look at, but a bit out of character.  My neighbourhood sushi joint also gives candy with the bill.  Aria should be a few notches above.

A complaint letter sent to the restaurant has gone unanswered.  So they're smug on top of everything else.  

Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but very pricy food with tiny portions. I get that it's chic and  upper class but $18 for three tiny mozzarella balls as an app is ridiculous. They also don't have an extensive dinner menu that appeals to everyone . It's not vegetarian friendly and very heavy on seafood  and meats like rabbit. I won't be back at all."}
{"text":"Was here for a corporate Christmas party and saw the Yelp reviews before we left and was already kind of knowing I was not going to love this.

We had cocktailing on the upper floor, need to take an elevator up. The passed canopies were all impossible to eat one handed and incredibly messy. This is a bad design on their part of executing a proper cocktail menu. It should be easy, clean bites. 

You can't take alcohol from one level to the next, so cocktail hour ended and we all left behind perfectly full glasses of alcohol--waste of money right there.

The bathrooms upstairs were incredibly odd but this is before I knew of the totally stupid bathroom situation downstairs.

The acoustics on the main level were so awful. No one could hear anyone who was presenting, so all speeches were a totally write off. Service was prompt and friendly, but one server reeked of body odour, which was a turn off.  

Food was terrible. Bland and boring. Poor presentation. I don't think Aria should be hosting parties because they simply cannot execute.  Even the bread was bad.

Bathrooms are in the public hallway and you need a code to get in, quite a trek from the restaurant and a bit odd to walk around in party clothes in a public ACC hallway ...

Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We had the Aria winterlicious menu.  My expectations were low given the location - you will expect and get over flow from any ACC events and it brings down the quiet, classy atmosphere they're chasing.

We had the sea scallops and steak tartara to start.  The scallops were cooked well, but on the salty side.  The tartara was very generous and delicious - definitely get this if you aren't afraid of raw meat.  I went with the veal cheeks for the main, while my gf had the scorpion fish pasta.  Again, the veal was very generous but on the saucy side.  Not bad for a Winterlicious serving.  The Scorpion fish was below average.  I like my pasta on the hard side, but if you don't  you won't like the way they cook it.  Never having had scorpion fish before, it's more of a grainy white fish.  For dessert, we had the panna cotta and piemonte.  Both the highlights of our meal (aside from the tartara).  The poprocks in the panna cotta add a nice surprise, and the piemonte was decadent.

Service was meh.  I didn't expect much, as it was winterlicious.  The server did the job and gave us our booze and food, but nothing memorable.  Overall,  Aria is an OK spot to go to if you are going to see a game, but somewhat of a touristy fine dining trap."}
{"text":"Great wine list. Food is just so-so with a relatively limited menu. Service was ok- and considering the few people in the restaurant at the time- rather disappointing..."}
{"text":"Aria is a nice restaurant. An aesthetically pleasing, well designed space. If it didn't have good food and service to back it up, I wouldn't care about the aesthetics, but it's a very nice atmosphere. My experiences are mainly lunchtime ones and I have no complaints about food or service. (I see that other diners/reviewers for dinner cannot say the same.) I've had a number of pasta dishes and have enjoyed each one; I can say the same for my dining companions. Portion sizes are not massive, yet they are filling. I've also had a burger with fries at lunch and it was delicious. The menu is seasonal so it is always changing. I'd suggest reviewing it before you go as selections may not be to your liking.  I find lunch reasonable but dinner can be pricey.  I've never been when lunch is terribly busy so it's not hard to get in. For dinner you are best off to have a reservation--it is very busy and can be slow. I've found it to be a bit of a \"boys' club\" in the dinner hours or later (it's just an observation and it's not a surprise surrounded by office towers, condos, the ACC and Le Germain Hotel next door). If it helps you to know: cash or credit, no debit. Washrooms: they are located just outside the restaurant in the Telus building's lobby; ask the host/hostess for the key.  There is also a patio. I understand the location's limitations with the surrounding environment, but on the patio it feels like you're in a bit of a parking lot, right at the ACC with the traffic and jumbo media screen. With such a great looking interior, you'd think the restaurant would go to more effort to make the patio more private and try to offer concealment from the unsightly elements so close by."}
{"text":"Great porterhouse, exceptionally grilled and flavoured
Loved the black currant sorbet
Cocktail cherries were exceptional (black cherries)
-1 for having to use a key card outside the restaurant to use the bathroom"}
{"text":"Really unfortunate service by a completely unknowledgable server.  My two girlfriends and I came to celebrate one of their birthdays and we were extremely disappointed with the experience.  We had made the reservation several days ahead and when we arrived, the restaurant was 80% empty yet they couldn't seat us at a table yet.  When we were finally seated, we were given the drink and wine lists and upon asking about a wine, the server was unable to ask questions about the characteristics of the it.  When he finally brought it, he said \"This is actually a dessert wine, do you still want it?\".  Not sure why he would think we would want a dessert wine (which he should have known before bringing it) when we hadn't even eaten (OR ORDERED) yet, mind you this was 25 minutes in and our menus had been closed for the past 15.  When the time finally came to order (after flagging the server down) he told us about the specials.  I was unsure about the information he provided me with because the pricing seemed to be too much so we ended up asking a different (far more knowledgable and professional) server who actually told us that the price was different AND there was another special dish our server hadn't even mentioned.  When the birthday girl ordered, she informed the waiter of her food allergies and also asked about how a dish was prepared.  The server then stared at the menu and just repeated what was on there.  We wanted to know specifics and he could not provide them to us.  He even replied \"it's really good\" for a dish we asked about the preparation for.  Finally, when our food came, the risotto had awful presentation, it looked like vomit (to be frank) and the tuna dishes were doused in what looked like a cream-based sauce.  When we asked if there was garlic in it (as this was an additional allergy my friend had not inquired about), he said he didn't know but that it was an \"aioli\"...shouldn't he know that garlic is WHAT AIOLI IS???  Also, he accused my friend of not saying she had a garlic allergy on top of the ones she had mentioned.  This is exactly why she asked how it was prepared.  The menu did not say there was garlic in it, you would think a menu should mention that the dish is covered in aioli since it's a strong flavour that not everyone likes.  The food was mediocre and all other servers and staff around were great but our server absolutely ruined the experience for us.  He looked sloppy, was unprofessional and not knowledgable.  I would not return to this restaurant for any occasion."}
{"text":"Aria is a relatively new addition to the York/Bremner strip (just 9 months young).  It is located in a great location (which also means that if there are events going on at the ACC that you might end up paying $25 for parking! Ouch.)  My word of advice?  Look for the Green P at 10 York Street (which doesn't look like it will be there very long as it looks like a condo development is going up in its place).  We were lucky enough to have nabbed the last spot and paid $4 for parking.

Tucked away in the corner of the Telus Tower you will find the entrance to Aria.  It has a very Manhattan feel to it with high ceilings, big glass windows that faces the Maple Leaf Square and trendy seating.  The chairs are quite comfortable, and the Damask sofa seats are chic!

I made a reservation online and the only time available was later in the evening.  I was rather upset when I showed up to the restaurant and there were quite a few empty tables.  I like to eat dinner earlier, rather than later.

A complimentary coat check is available though the hostess was less than stellar. She left us unattended for a few minutes before reappearing.  However, another server (who I later found out is the pioneer behind the Cocktail Menu) aided us.

We were seated in the corner with a great view of Maple Leaf Square.  The service here is very lax and this is definitely a place you could spend hours at without being hustled out the door.  

After having perused the cocktail menu I decided on La Motta, which is a vodka-based drink with fresh yuzu, peach simple syrup and rosemary.  To my surprise, my cocktail was salty?  I don't think I was so hungry that my taste buds went awry, but my DC also concluded that my drink was salty.  When prompted about how our cocktails were I mentioned I didn't like it, and the Ryan Gosling look-a-like cocktail pioneer said he'd whip me up another cocktail personally.  This time I opted for the Dahlia.  While I did say I wanted something sweeter, this was TOO sweet.  It was like drinking a minty maple syrup.  The presentation of the cocktails were pretty, but suffice it to say that I nursed my sweet cocktail like a child forced to drink carrot juice.  The Sazerac that my DC ordered was definitely a man's drink as it was S-T-R-O-N-G (Rye whiskey-based drink).  My word of advice, order a wine instead.  They have an impressive display of wines that go from floor to ceiling (and that is one HIGH ceiling).  

A trio of bread was brought out.  A French, an Italian and a Focaccia.   The Focaccia was by far my favourite as it was crusty on the top, but spongy throughout.  It was a Rosemary bread, and was very good with the spreadable butter.

For starters we ordered the Carne Cruda served with a raw egg, black truffle and Porcini fries.  This knocked my socks off.  This is what a steak tartare should be like.  Tender, just the right amount of salt, and just the right amount of pickled tang.  It didn't even need pepper.  The raw egg added a luxurious, creamy texture to the dish.  And the fries, although there were only 5 of them, were divine.

For mains we opted for the Bigoli alla Bottarga which was a thick noodle served with garlic, chillies, roasted tomatoes, herbs and Bottarga di Muggine which is a cured roe of grey mullets.  The thick noodles were a very firm pasta.  I just kept chewing and chewing and chewing at it.  The tomatoes were pleasantly sweet, but I didn't care too much for the bitter aftertaste of the Bottarga.  

The Deboned Partridge served atop a bed of Fregola Sarda, porcini bread stuffing, bay leaf essence, chestnuts and fig puree.  Fregola Sarda is a type of Sardinian pasta that loosely resembles Israeli Couscous but has the texture of a Spaetzle.  It was very savoury and complemented the crisp-skinned deboned partridge very well.  I don't know that I would've chosen partridge as it is a much more muscular bird, which means a tougher meat.  

For dessert we were disappointed to learn that the Napolean and Chocolate Eclairs were sold out for the night, so we opted for the Buddino.  In hindsight, I probably should've taken the sold-out options as a cue that they were the best in the house and opted out of dessert.  Oh well.  The Buddino was served with a Mascarpone cheese.  It was quite the unconventional \"pudding\" as it was more like a flourless chocolate cake encased with a tart pastry.  The chocolate flavour was quite weak as it but lingered for a mere second in your mouth before disappearing altogether and if there was any chestnut, it was lost.  The tart shell was chewy.  I think this dish is lost somewhere between a flourless chocolate cake and a brownie.  

Verdict:
I would recommend Aria for its service and ambiance before its food.  The food may not be suitable for those who are the \"meat and potatoes\" type and non-experimental as they use untraditional ingredients.  Some of the food was wonderfully executed while tweaks were needed for others."}
{"text":"Do yourself a big favour and walk across the street to e11even and eat there. Food was average but the service was terrible. Why rush your customers to finish when your dining room is half full? Not worth the cost despite the lovely interior. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"If you're planning to stop by here before an event at the Air Canada Centre, be prepared to be seated separately with other concert goers or Leafs fans. The physical appearance of the restaurant is quite nice, however everything else from the service to the food is subpar. The menu was small and did not have a big selection. My pasta was undercooked unfortunately... The wait staff looked overwhelmed, so we remained patient and waited for our bill. Overall, for the price one pays at this place, I'd say go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Probably a 2.5 on my scale.
They were good at getting us fed in time for the game. Food was fine but not up to the quality their price point would suggest.
Waiter however was excellent and the wine selection was good."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday and the waiter had snarky comments. She suggested to see the cheaper section of wine when we didn't ask because she thought that was all we could afford, and she hurried one of our friends to pay because she wanted to go home. Not a kind and welcoming environment. Food was ok, better places to go other than this place."}
{"text":"What I expected from an Italian restaurant: Remarkably rich food served in medium to large portions served by loveable waiters/waitresses.

What I actually experienced: Bland food served in small portions (except for the main -- although I wouldn't mind having less of it) served by an emotionless waiter. 

I went to Aria for Summerlicious and ordered the watermelon salad (literally 7 cubes of watermelon), the \"Entrecôte\" (served medium rare but the meat was very chewy and it was lukewarm -- blech!), and their house spun gelato served in espresso (this was okay, but nothing special). 

1 star for the food. 

Overall rating of 2 stars because the decor was nice. And although the waiter lacked personality, he was helpful nonetheless."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such a low rating. We tried to go to E11even before the Raps game and it was ridiculously busy. Due to proximity, we walked over to Aria and we were seated right away. 

They have a pretty extensive wine menu by the bottle. I saw a review indicating they don't serve by the glass of take debit; they do both however the 'by the glass' section is a bit limited but pretty standard. We had a bottle of chianti -- which you can't really good wrong with and my friend had a pasta that she devoured in seconds and I had the salmon filet which was really nicely cooked, not too salty and went well with the quinoa salad. 

The only real downfall was the service. It was a bit on the slower side, however, it seemed that our server was handling several of the tables so we requested our cheque when our entrees arrived so we could depart immediately for the game."}
{"text":"Attentive, professional service, and convenient for a pre-game meal. Bonus: in the cold winter months you can get here from union station without having to go outside :)

The food is on the expensive side and is hit and miss. The 3 star rating is a result of my $45 rabbit loin which emerged from the kitchen looking good but tasting like overcooked chicken. Not acceptable at that price.

The three others at my table enjoyed their Branzino, Risotto and Mushroom ravioli respectively, though. The charcuterie board was also very good and generously portioned. 

Decor is elegant and you can enjoy great pre-game people watching as they stream into the ACC past the place."}
{"text":"Good location, therefore no effort in food or service.  The waitress looked like she didn't want to be there and the fake smile was just sad. 

Veal chop for $45 that is basically fried pork chops ( except it's veal....maybe)
Server didn't bother giving us steak knives so we were working pretty hard to get a bite. 

I had the pork belly where the skin was so chewy it got stuck to the roof of my mouth. 

Really really sad. I had lunch just last week and the food was better. Too bad it's so inconsistent."}
{"text":"I was expecting the price to be more at this place because it is next to the ACC  ... but surprisingly it is not.  I had the seafood spaghetti and it was delicious. The menu is not big but had allot of choices still. The servers were all pleasant.  Not sure why there are negative reviews ... don't trust them.  Umm a foodie and  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good service, was almost empty when my party of 8 arrived which is probably why we had what seemed like every server in the place looking after our table.  Food was good, not outstanding for the price paid and portions were little.  I didn't have to pay for parking as a friend of mine lives at Maple Leafs Square but unless you do too, expect to pay anywhere from $15 - $30 for parking."}
{"text":"Go early or make a reservation if there is ANY thing going on at Air Canada Centre. 

We started with the cheese plate. You can choose between 3 or 5 cheeses. When the cheese plate arrives, you will notice the small portions..but they are rich, flavorful cheeses and the serving sizes are indeed appropriate. 

We both ordered the soup special, Minestrone. It was NOT minestrone. It was basically a few potatoes floating in pureed squash and pretty much void of flavor. We used the toasted bread from our cheese plate to dip in to the soup for some added flavor and texture. 

We also shared the mushroom ravioli with sautéed mushrooms and truffle butter sauce. It was delicious! It made up for the soup definitely. 

There is an extensive wine list...24 pages to be honest. There are also plenty of cocktails to chose from as well.

{"text":"I am really surprised that this place has such negative reviews for what it actually serves and represents...people, really need to stop being so harsh on restaurants...you ain't paying michelin star pricing so please don't expect a michelin star resto for under $100/pp...

Came with my coworkers for summerlicious when it occurred, we made reservations and walked over from work. We were almost seated instantaneously..the decor was simple and clean...service was decent and we were checked upon in a timely manner....the food was average portions and average taste...nothing screamed awesomely delicious and nothing was disappointing...

I ended up ordering the flank steak on the menu, it was cooked medium rare and plated well..no complaints...a few of my coworkers ordered the risotto which had a pretty big portion that couldnt be finished (we're just average eaters...)

I don't understand the previous reviews about the portions being small..I mean this is obviously not McDonalds and/or a food court place. Don't expect to stuff your faces with a Big Mac and/or a huge box for $10..

This is a place where you can enjoy company and food...don't be scared off by the negative reviews as per Amy K....I agree with you!

All in all, I will be back..."}
{"text":"Don't let the negative reviews scare you off. They scared me off and I only came here because my friend really wanted to try the place and it would have been a shame if I didn't end up going! The restaurant itself is quite attractive and very insta-worthy. I really enjoyed the lighting and high ceilings. The service was good and the restaurant was spacious and not packed (although it was not during a game or concert evening). I had the mushroom ravioli and it was out of this WORLD!!!!!!!! Honestly it was fantastic and I will definitely be back to try it once again. My dining companion had the octopus appetizer and it was quite small (which is why I knocked off a star). For the price I expected more, and while it was delicious it wasn't as amazing as Joso's grilled octopus. All in all though it was a great experience and I definitely recommend this place for a nice night out with friends."}
{"text":"Aria. Chic for the Masses.

Aria, the newest restaurant to the downtown neighborhood. North West of the ACC entrance. Just over a year old. Positions itself as fine dining Italian and certainly fulfills its promise. But is there space for yet another Italian restaurant in the neighborhood? We have at least 3 on the waterfront and numerous more on King and just a walk away, further North. Not going to dwell too much on the menu or wine list, as a quick check out on other Yelp reviews will tell you how varied the comments are. Nothing to write home about, though, or even anything compared to the Mercatos or in the pockets North of Highway 7. I get the feeling that this is a pre-concert (for adult audiences, I may add) at the ACC, kind of place or a nice catch-up-after-work-near-the-hotel-before-I-take-my-train-back-home-from-Union Station, kind of place.

There is nothing unusual or different about the food or atmosphere or service. While the ambience simulates a romantic setting, a pre concert crowd or office party, could change that around - especially because of the open concept design.

So in summary, typical fine dining Italian fare, pleasant décor, service that is trying hard to please and prices you'd expect from a downtown shop. Worth checking out. At least once."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was a tad nervous a few weeks ago when I had reserved their private space for a company dinner given that their reviews had dropped between spring to fall. I can't explain why, because their service was great, the food was fantastic, and the kitchen was very accommodating to all the various dietary restrictions we had in the group. 

We had a few dishes that got mixed up but the kitchen and servers were quick to fix it.

Thank you Vanessa for hosting such an incredible night."}
{"text":"Aria Ristorante was a huge let down.  We were here for dinner and it was like a ghost town (waiter said it was because of the NHL strike).  

After our boring and tasteless dinner, we came to the conclusion it was because of the slow service and dull food.

The place is AMAZINGLY GORGEOUS (I have pictures on our site), but the food and service (and HIGH prices) make it a place we won't visit again."}
{"text":"Aria has a great ambiance and a nice menu.  Kelley was a fantastic server. Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"I made reservations almost 2 weeks in advance, once we arrived they told us to sit in the side area among a group of ppl right where the door was as ppl coming and going + wait staff to get to the patio? In my reservation I specified birthday so would love a window seat( private) . Then they said oh you can have this table BUT pls be out by 8 PM? FYI no mention of my wife`s birthday !! I felt rushed and was not happy from arrival to exit of this place and we will never be back.!!

Should of went with my gut and went to e11even , Avoid this place.!!"}
{"text":"The best late-night spot we've found in Toronto. Marta and John are professional bartenders who engage and entertain with witty conversation and back-off when you're having your own conversations. Drinks never went dry and were very well-made - Manhattan and Old Fashioned were superb. Marta's Old Fashioned was exceptional, as she uses three orange peels - great citrus flavor that didn't overwhelm the bourbon. The small bites menu was really quite good, with the lardo bruschetta, meatball, and bufala among both of our faves. I loved the calamari - super-meaty pieces with a light dusting - but my wife prefers smaller pieces with more breading so didn't love it.

Come here after an ACC or Rogers event - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is convenient for business lunches and I have never seen this place busy so no reservations required. Food is good but it is overpriced. Either increase the portion size or reduce the price point. I had to get something else to eat after lunch was over."}
{"text":"The customer service is not really satisfied. I think one of the waiters maybe in a bad mood, so it just makes me feel awkward? the dessert tastes good though"}
{"text":"Food was bland and unremarkable. Not bad but just food. We were there prior to a concert and we were at the front end of the rush. Nonetheless it seemed like our mains may have sat under a heat lamp too long as my ravioli had almost crispy edges that were tough to cut. The service was good and every effort was made to provide a quality experience. Just too bad the chef and kitchen didn't weren't equally motivated. Won't return as there are too many good options nearby."}
{"text":"Visited during winterlicious, and boy I definitely do not regret it!  First off, the beet salad to me was lacking but the goat cheese definitely made up for it. The crab cake was very good. But the best was the braised beef cheek - it was so soft and it just melts in your mouth, it tasted soooooo good the king mushroom ensemble was the ultimate best beef cheek I ever had. The PEI mussels was good but I still felt like it was a bit fishy. Then the dessert, the cannoli was so good with a nice crispy shell and the chocolate wasn't super sweet. Got the trinity cocktail as well, it smells very fruity, but the alcohol is a bit strong if you ask me. 

Just wished the servers paid a bit more attention. Had to wait a while just to order."}
{"text":"The food was good.

That's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about our experience at Aria.

When you go for dinner, you expect to feel special.   Here, we felt like cattle.  Herded into what was essentially an oversized junkyloft condominium.   Plopped down in the middle of the open room.   Stared at by social climbers and mid-priced escorts.

Then there was the rush.  

We had just finished ordering and our pre-prepared appetizers were already on their way to the table.   Several minutes later, the bread came.... followed by the wine.   No sooner than our last bite, and the plates were whisked away into the ether.   They were immediately replaced with the next course.   No time in between.  The whole dinner couldn't have lasted much more than half an hour.    The timing and pacing of the meal was horrendous.  
   

Sometimes, you go into a restaurant and you feel like romance was in the air.  Here, it seemed like every other person in the room was on an online date.

I guess telling your online date that you're having dinner at \"Maple Leaf Square\" has a nicer ring to it than \"the abandoned railyards turned prefab jungle behind union station\".     

I am constantly amazed at people who believe that just because a place is shiny and very expensive, it is classy.   This is a classless shell of a restaurant, a pathetic mess of slimy lawyers and the over-madeup.     What's decent in food can be found in any of the other 10000 restaurants in this city.  

It's a place where you're made to feel like you've snuck into the party, but it's still lamer than you expected.
  
Avoid."}
{"text":"Food came cold and took forever. We had a group of 16 (not 50!) and they blamed it on the fact that we went off the menu and didn't have a pre-set menu. It was empty too... Not a surprise, given how terrible the service was. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"After the lacrosse game, Gord and I stopped in at Aria Ristorante, which is next door to the ACC, for a glass of wine.

There are fires on the patio to keep you warm.

We ordered a glass of bubbly.

It's a fancy spot. We sat at the bar, which was weird because the chairs are really really high and the bar is too low. So we had to kind of lean, which was awkward.

Kyle took good care of us. He surprised us with a sample of their cheese balls ... they were yummy!

I might pop back for a glass of wine. Though the menu looked good, I doubt I'd go back to eat there (too fancy and pricy for me)."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner prior to the Leafs game. Delicious food and very quick service. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place lived up to its poor rating.  Had a table of 8 at 6pm the Saturday night of the NBA All-Star weekend.  Since it is located steps from the arena, we thought this was a great way to start the night.  Wrong.  Drinks were ordered immediately and delivered 30 minutes later - guess the All-Star game caught them by surprise.  Sensing they were \"off\" we placed out dinner orders right way.  An hour and 15 minutes later, \"they are being plated right now\" was the response.  The manager acted like this was our fault and had a horrible attitude.  My salad was forgotten, the veal was bland, the fish was \"average\" and the steaks under cooked.  Not once during this two hour debacle did anyone ask to take a second drink order.  Only apologies from a hapless and overwhelmed waiter.   Net, we ate our below average food in 5 minutes and rushed to the game - with zero follow up from the manager.  If he reads this I would say, \"you're welcome for the $600 bill we dropped and I would suggest you change professions.\"

Of course I wouldn't recommend going there, but my belief is that with service like this, they won't be in business much longer - saving other diners from the experience we had."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life.  We had a business dinner with clients and thank God we already had their business.  We started out with the wrong menus, not a huge deal but just the beginning.

We ordered our food and I am positive they lost the order as it took 2:45 minutes to get served.  When we questioned what the problem was, we were told they were having issues that night.  That really wasn't our problem!  

The final and worst past of the evening was when a pregnant woman in our group found a band aid in her dinner.  And she had actually been chewing on it not knowing what it was!!  

Any restaurant with quality service would have known that between the duration to get the meal, and the band aid, there should not have been a bill.  But, there was.  They gave us a free half bottle of wine and took off the meal with the band aid.  

And to complete the evening, our waiter never apologized once.  

Do not eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Bad food and overpriced. Wouldn't recommend or return. Basic pasta was overcooked. Washrooms are located outside of the restaurant which is annoying."}
{"text":"I was gluttonous for punishment and obviously didn't learn my lesson the first time I came here, but, with only an hour until the Raptor's game and a ravenous appetite, I let my boyfriend convince me to give it another shot. ('C'mon, you're a Yelper!') 

I should have just gone with my instincts, because a year later, and this place still doesn't have their shit together. 

Our waitress was a total space cadet, who seemed to be perpetually wandering around, with no end destination in sight -- and it wasn't to anyone's table. 

I had what I think was a beet gnocchi with some sort of cream sauce that was...stringy in texture. (That was a major 'wtf?') we also ordered the calamari which was very poorly cut, and rubbery, and a whole lot of, 'wow, this is really unappetizing.' 

$80.00 later, and I'm still kicking myself for getting talked into coming here again -- Yelper or not.

Aria, I mean it this time, I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Pricier end, I would say..but Not sure why the low rating. Went here on a Friday during lunch. Friendly, attentive staff, good ambiance. 
The mushroom ravioli was very tasty ! Edges were a bit too al'dente in my opinion, but middle was perfect. Surprisingly my favorite was the beef carpaccio, flavored well and so thinly delicate, melt in your mouth! 
We also had the fried calamari which was good and not chewy and the grilled squid which was tender. Flavors were good but among what we had, I liked the first two dishes myself."}
{"text":"Location, location, location! Great pre-game fine-dining restaurant with fantastic modern decor/lighting and super friendly service. Fun being right beside the Raptors \"Jurrassic Park\" and being able to see the excitement on the gigantic screen out the windows. Excellent wine list. Delicious and high quality appetizers. Serving size of main dishes on the small side. Service slightly slow ...  no one wants to miss game action while waiting for dinner to be served."}
{"text":"I was hesitant initially to book this place for a company lunch due to the low reviews but those didn't do the restaurant justice. We had a large group and had no problems booking online. The restaurant is gorgeous and had an airy feel to it. They offer complimentary coat check which was nice. Our server was attentive, food came out fast and everything was smooth. Food wise I got their special which was a brisket gnocchi. It was a little bit on the salty side but was nonetheless delicious. Overall it was a good experience! Note if you are a large group they do require one bill and a 18% service charge i believe? Which is pretty standard in the district."}
{"text":"Food ****
Service ****
Ambiance ****
(Out of 5)

Aria is located in my office building and is the default for working lunches when time is tight or we feel like italian.  I should mention the service and food here is always top notch... So while it's a default, it's not a fall-back!  

The restaurant has very high ceilings and has floor to ceiling windows. It's beautifully designed and probably one of my favourite restaurant spaces in Toronto.  It makes it a welcoming bright space during the day for lunch.  For dinner, it's a hidden pre-Raptors/Leafs/Concert gem, beside the ACC.  

The calamari as a starter is always a go to.  My favourite meal I've had there was when the buffalo mozzarella was part of their specials... It came as a huge strip on a butcher block.   I've had the burgers, salads, pasta, steak and others here however normally stick to a salad with some protein on top and calamari to start.  

Don't miss the olive oil and bread that they serve on every table. It sounds basic and simple but the olive oil is incredible and a fantastic combo with the bread.  

Reservations would be recommended later in the work week for lunch or for dinner on game nights."}
