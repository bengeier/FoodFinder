{"text":"Good quality price seafood restaurant. You pick the seafood in the counter like at a fish market and they prepare it for. The decor is a bit bare and the service is acceptable. Our waitress was very friendly, but the clerk at the fish counter was impatient and not friendly. The grilled octopus is amazing, my group liked all the seafood we ordered, but the brown rice was over spiced with cumin and too salty."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé du calmar et de la pieuvre sautée à l'ail, une déception, le calmar était sans chapelure, la pieuvre n'était pas assez fraîche. C'est bizarre car d'habitude leur service est bon. Cette fois le prix était cher pour la qualité de la bouffe."}
{"text":"My favorite sea food restaurant.  A glimpse of home, very tasty seafood and great prices"}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Bad service. The waiter looked like a bouncer and intimidating , not friendly."}
{"text":"awfully service in my life never seen a worst waiter and cook. I would never go back. nothing like the other ones."}
{"text":"Most terrible restaurant, bring half your food and the other 35 min later , everything has parsley and it's terrible ... Service sucks and your lucky to see a waitress .... Will not go back"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place but I was terribly let down. The octopus cost $24 (before tax) and it tasted off. My husband had a couple of bites and then felt nauseous. Also, the shrimp was not worth $20. The fries were good though, and the servers were nice. Overall, I would not come back and will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"False advertisement regarding their specials.  The prices are not what they advertise on their website and on the truck located at the corner of Taschereau.  Their supper-time price was already over at 7PM.  So when is supper time? At 4PM?  And when is lunch time?  At 10AM?
I won't recommend anyone to the Greenfield Park restaurant plus the produces are overpriced.
We left without ordering anything."}
{"text":"Delicieux ! 
J'ai beaucoup aimer le . principe de choisir son poisson ;-)
Nous avons pris la pieuvre, delicieuse !!!
Le fish and chips, des patates, des legumes et une salade : tres copieux on en a encore pour demain...
Le restaurant a une terrasse l'été. 
Table a l'intérieur simple.
Manque juste un peu plua de deco genre un aquarium !"}
{"text":"Even if I love cooking at home,  grilling or frying fresh fish can be a pain! For this reason, we decided to try out la poisonnerie Rayan. We were unsure how to order but the staff were very helpful and guided us through the procedure. We ordered a fish called \"la dorade royale\" it was so tasty the spices used to cook the fish had loads of flavor! The potato cuts were crispy and delicious, the shrimps were savoury and juicy... everything exceeded our expectations! Not only do I need to prepare fish at home anymore, my husband doesn't even need to go fishing either ;)"}
{"text":"I am soo glad they opened one at Brossard. Love their food here, and hospitality. The place itself is located right on taschereau, perfect for families to meet up because it isnt too far from the highway, and of course for the locals. They have a nice terrace, but its right directly under the sun, so a nice shade would work perhaps. Anyways inside the place like always they have their seafoody, lime greeny on blue walls decor. Same booths and chairs to keep the chain thing going. Not much difference from the cote des neiges location, however this place is big on take out. Also I dont know if its because I went on a Thursday day shift, but theyre fish selection seemed smaller then the other places. And as always service was polite and courteus. I was very happy with my experience. 

Verdict: A must go for them fam jamz :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on my birthday and was super pleased! Everything is delicious. We had a feast of calamari, two types of fish, shrimp, veggies, seasoned rice and wedge garlic potatoes- what a delicacy! Some of the best seafood I've ever had hands down. The concept is really neat since it's like going to the market, you choose your catch, pay by weight and it's all prepared fresh for you. 
Btw, the shrimp are not fully deshelled, but that's done on purpose because they lock in more of that sweet juicy flavor when cooked!  A little more work but your mouth will thank you.

For around 80$ there was more than enough to feed 4 people, I brought lots of leftovers home which lasted me an extra two meals. 

The restaurant is not fancy by any means, it's kinda mismatched, could be a cross between a diner and sports bar because of the TVs. As for the waiter serving us that evening, the extremely tall young man is the owner's newphew- although he was very friendly, he did forget a couple items. If you're not picky about the atmosphere or getting five star service, the food will definitely be worth it. 

Note- they accept cards, although if you opt for cash, you won't be charged any tax."}
{"text":"Really down to earth place, nothing fancy, but with great seafood, very flavorful, and great prices too. I just don't understand why they don't peel the shrimp in the fried shrimp order, most of the spices were tossed away with the shells. (I found out that they do peel the shrimps for an extra dollar per pound I think, if you ask them to).."}
