{"text":"Very pleased with our experience. Great off the strip option for the Las Vegas area. Excellent prices for the stay. The Feast buffet is a great priced food option. Bottomless mimosas for breakfast was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Rosalita's Cantina @ Sunset Station  Best Mojito I've ever had!!!  We went on a Sunday for the happy hour at Rosalita's Cantina. Our bartender \"Sosa\" was top notch. He had a great sense of humor and establishes exceptional rapport with the guests. Being a Cuban native he smiled when I asked for a Mojito....and said \"you make me feel at home, this is our drink! \" It truly was his drink!! I've had Mojitos in some of the best Cuban and Caribbean restaurants in NY, and his topped them all. I look forward to going back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love it but location a bit distance .Serving me to my needs extremely appreciate the awesome customer service! Thank you"}
{"text":"Stayed here for Punk Rock Bowling a few years back and, as nice as it was to have everything in one location, I'm really glad that the PRB location was never Sunset Station again.  Startings when we were checking in, the staff was kind of rude. We had booked 4 rooms with two double beds and two of those rooms ended up just having one King in it... for four people. When we expressed confusion as to why we weren't getting what we had reserved, the woman checking us in was very brusque and uninterested in resolving our issues. We also had security staring down every punk walking towards the poker tournament that first night. I think a LOT of people complained because the disdain was much more subtle for the rest of the weekend.  Next, the elevator situation. There were four elevators. Four. For the whole tower. They were located right inside the exit to the festival. They were broken. A lot.   I don't really remember any other specifics but I know I didn't care for the place."}
{"text":"There is something about coming to this Station Casino that I love. It could be because it's just walking distance from me. It could be because every single time I go there I always have a fantastic time. It could be because I love the Station Casino commercials. All I know is, whenever my visiting friends and family come here they always enjoy this place more than going to \"strip\" casinos."}
{"text":"Everything seems great except you have to pay for internet which I think is really stupid. I would rather stay at a hotel without a casino than stay here."}
{"text":"I stay here often for business travel.  Nice place if you are looking for something off the strip.  Rates are normally very reasonable.   Rooms are nice and clean.  Nice mall and shopping around this casino."}
{"text":"I'm not a gambler. I have probably gambled here 10 times in the 10 years I have lived in Henderson/Las Vegas. I do however come to Sunset station fairly often. They have a pretty good buffet at a decent price if you have a players card. Like I said I don't gamble much but I have saved a lot of money just from discounts on the buffet with the players card.   I also cash my check here for free since the company I work for does not offer direct deposit. When you cash your check they offer you a free spin on a computerized wheel which I'm sure is fixed in some way since a always seem to end up getting the same prize which is points on my players card. But that's ok because that means free buffets! All though it would be nice to hit the $10000 prize just once."}
{"text":"The absolutely worst hotel stay I've ever had! It started at check-in with \"come back in three hours our system is down\". No apology, just a statement. Like I was annoying him with my presence. The next morning it took 15 minutes for the cashier/greeter to acknowledge our existence and another 10 minutes to have a waitress appear in the cafe. There were only about 10 people in the place ( 4 tables) so it's not like they were busy. On my last night the people in the room above me sounded like they were playing football. I called security at 12:30AM and 2:30AM. Both times they said they would \"investigate\" and get back to me. No calls and the noise went on until 3:30AM. I truly thought they were doing construction in the room! At 4:30AM I checked out of the hotel. I requested to speak with a manager but none was available. The clerk said he would e-mail a manager and have them call me the next day. I have yet to receive a call. Also,, the \"prime rib\" at the buffet was so tough it was inedible!"}
{"text":"Nice clean locals casino in Henderson. It has a movie theatre, bowling, large sports book and fast food restaurants.  It's a great place to relax and sit at the bar watching your favorite sport."}
{"text":"Friendly team members, good food, lots of table action at the craps table. Great promos and tournaments. Close to shopping and you can't beat the room prices. If your out of state sign up for a players card and receive room offers plus get a discount at the buffet. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went to the oyster bar tonight. Customer service, horrible, drink service, horrible.  Arrived at 830 and sat at the bar with the wife. Had to BEG for someone to serve us.  Ordered drinks and never recieved refill service on waters or soda. Vodka Martini extremely watered down. Asked for a gin and tonic, got a gin and soda. People dont care ,all seemed like they rather be some where else.  AVOID.  2nd note.  Complained about service to management, got a sideways look.   Couldnt understand why service was so bad.  I guess they just dont get it.. wont be back its that embarrassing."}
{"text":"on mothers day we went to eat breakfast because someone recommended me the place but THE ONE THING THAT ALOMST RUINED MY DAY WAS THE \"MANAGER\" that day they were giving away flowers for mothers day and when they handme one i ask for a purple instead of a white one they where giving me and the manager who was standing looking at the cashiers replied that that wasnt possible because they where giving them ramdomly !!!! like reallyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!! well that was my experince"}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  Casino is beautiful if you like the old ones with character.  On the Buffet-- Food choices not as high level as Green Valley but they have all the basic necessities (like fresh romaine, veggies, excellent chicken, and of course ice cream) and they are different enough that you can pick completely different items than at Green Valley and Red Rock.  For those with kids, this buffet choices are very family-friendly.  Service here is the best of all the stations we have been to--whoever runs the buffet really does a great job.  For the price (and all the station discounts), you just can't go wrong here.  On the Café-- just so-so.  No bar.  Service and food just ok.  Our favorite Café is at Green Valley where we like to sit at the bar.  Pasta Cucina-- love it overall.  Great prices, way more food than you need (but still want).  Their minestrone soup is awesome.  We love most everything we have tried-- spaghetti and meatballs, chix parm, and the chix fettucini with artichoke are my favorites.  Wish they would serve breadsticks with some color on them, but overall we really enjoy this restaurant.  Games-- sometimes we win, sometimes we don't :)"}
{"text":"Sunset station is pretty cool we like it! It has a great pool, movie theater bowling alley, lots of different places to eat inside and a big casino!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  We were there for the Quiet Riot show this past weekend otherwise we would not have stayed at this establishment.  The room was average, horrible shower head and sink did not drain properly.  Room service closes at 9pm...Really? in Vegas!  Menu was very limited.  Pool closed at 4pm on Friday, due to a concert in the amphitheater, yet did not for Quiet Riot the next night.  Secondly, pool was not heated nor was there any wait service.  They did have a small alcohol kiosk that was cash only. Way lame!  Bars in casino all close early except for one.   The entertainment at Club Madrid was great! and the outdoor venue for the show was great as well.  Overall, much better deals elsewhere.  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"L0vë this place! It's local to moms spot in Henderson. I fly out here frequently from Cali. Lots of places to chose from when we're not stayin' at mom's, but Sunset Station is always friendly and fun. The pool area is nice and clean and never crowded. Bartenders are cool and the cabana for a day experience is a must."}
{"text":"The casino is pretty small and in some places really smokey.  The air system doesn't seem to push the smoke very well.  There were some places that was hot and other areas where you would freeze your a$$ off.  The dealers on the tablle I didn't like very much.  They saw that I was a platinum boarding pass holder but asked me where I play.  I usually go to Green Valley Ranch and they kept making comments of me finally getting smart and playing at Sunset.  Not very professional when it's a sister property.  Joking I get it but to say it over and over again for the 20 mins I decided to stay at the table was very irritating.  I finally took my money and left.  I don't plan on doing any gaming here in the future and will come back for bowling only.  The amenities the hotel provides is a plus however.  They have a kids area where you can drop off for a few hours, movies, bowling, etc.  That's the only reason I gave this hotel the 3rd star."}
{"text":"One of the best casinos in Henderson. My husband and I usually go to the Cabo once a month."}
{"text":"Sunset Station isn't bad..it's pretty easy to get to the bowling alley is good...restaurants and buffet are alright..of course it was allot better when they 1st opened...now it's just mediocre & average...will i be back Here?  Probably..my daughter loves the bowling alley and arcade..staff is warm & friendly...courteous and professional...all in all its a pretty ok casino..allot better than the crapholes they have in downtown Henderson & downtown Las Vegas for that matter!"}
{"text":"Worst check in experience ever. The check In girl \"mari\" would not look up from her computer to even listen to what we needed in order to accommodate our stay. She should understand without paying customers such as ourselves she would have no job ."}
{"text":"I hate to say this because I love sunset station (the casino). But the hotel stinks. Literally. It smells. It's smoky, makes it worse by covering it up with cheap deodorizer, and that ruins an otherwise adorable place. Stop letting people smoke in non-smoking rooms. And if they do, then fix the damn problem."}

{"text":"trying to have a nice quiet dinner.  the announcer for the awards giveaways is way too loud in the restaurant"}

{"text":"Love the Sunset hotel.  Have stayed here several times.  Casino is nice.  Gaudi bar is lovely & very good happy hour prices.  Pool area is very pleasant also.  1 question/concern, however:  what is the noxious cleaning product used in the hallway carpet between the hotel elevators and the casino?   It has to be one of the most over-powering and odious smells we've ever encountered.  My wife is very sensitive to smells and it gave her vicious headaches the days/evenings it was applied and for several days after.  Is there not another rug cleaner/disinfectant which could be used which is not so nauseatingly offensive?   E & J"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this hotel and casino for years. When we lived in Henderson we came frequently to eat and gamble. When we lived out of Nevada we would receive free stays. We now live about 400 miles away.  My wife received an email offer for \"special room rates.\"  Since my birthday was coming up, she went to the website to book a room. The reservation site said we would receive up to three nights free. Sweet, right? So we load up the car and drive 6 hours. When we go to check in, instead of free nights the tab is around $300. For some reason, \"comp\" now means free resort fees, not free lodging. Very deceptive, and a great way to ruin a birthday.   Thanks, Sunset Station. You've received your last dollar from me."}
{"text":"Spent the 29th and 30th of September here, the rooms were great, comfortable and cheap, the buffets were pretty good, but the circle bar( I don't know the name) was great, the bartenders were friendly and nice, and generous with comped drinks. Laughed with them watching Monday Night Football and the next night baseball playoffs. A great and relaxing couple of days at Sunset Station."}
{"text":"It is very unfortunate that this incident occurred, but it is very important that this does not happen to another person -   I love playing craps and have been playing for years....I work at a casino so I know the rules of the game.  A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of playing craps with a bunch of friends visiting here.  The crap table was full and we were all having a good time. Nothing obnoxious, just good old mature fun.   Then this happens...  The pit boss decides to not only warn me, but provide a full blown lecture of how I'm braking their 8 second rule and have to hit the back wall of the crap table. Now I completely understand that it's their job to throw the shooter off, but this was uncalled for.  The reason behind that is, every other shooter took substantially longer than I did when setting their dice. Most of the other shooters did not hit the back wall and my tosses did.  My friends could not believe that he only lectured me for it so they purposely took long and did not hit the wall to see if they would get a warning. One of them even raised the dice to their face to set it, and nothing.  The other 14 people had no warnings whatsoever.  I believe that this was discrimination and will never return to that casino, nor will I ever have anything nice to say about it.  I can understand that maybe the pit boss gentleman may have been having a bad day or just broke up with his Asian girlfriend that looked like me, but that was completely unprofessional and demeaning.  This is something that needs to be addressed and I hope that man will think twice before doing that again."}
{"text":"Like the buffet staff was nice, the cocktail waitress was slow didn't come back with our drinks for almost 30 min when we were gambling. Played almost 100 befor she even came around the first time. Overall was it was nice."}
{"text":"We flew to Vegas on September 7 to attend the Gary Allan concert being held at Sunset Station.  I reserved a King Suite, spending approximately $675 for two nights using their prepay option which offers a discount.    Upon arrival I was asked if I had reserved a smoking room.  I had no idea that smoking rooms in hotels still existed and I told Ms. Irwin, the desk clerk, that I didn't want a smoking room.  Our \"king suite\" turned out to be Room 223, the hospitality suite located on the second floor near the meeting rooms.  For $675 we had a view of a wall on one side and the employee smoking area below the bedroom window.    While the room was spacious, the housekeeping was suspect.  Upon running a clean tissue over the floor I must have picked up hair and lint from the past year.    The employee smoking area below the window was somewhat noisy at night.  The casino being a 24-hour operation, there was always someone out there and I don't think they knew how well their voices carried.   Upon checking out, I presented Ms. Irwin with the aforementioned tissue in a plastic bag and a list of things that just didn't seem right.  She said that I had stated I had wanted a nonsmoking king suite, implying it was my choice to take this second floor room.  I told her that I didn't think that room was often used for overnight guests, but received only minimal upkeep for hospitality functions.  She said that they could contact housekeeping and tell them they weren't cleaning well enough.  But she was clearly not going to do anything for me.    I think Ms. Irwin should have immediately contacted the manager.  I was somewhat frustrated and just walked out since there was a line of people behind me wanting to check out.  I somewhat expected a phone call within a couple of days of checking out, but I think \"quick in / quick out\" is the method of operation at many of these casinos.  Databases and frequent player cards have taken the place of customer service.   Needless to say, this wasn't value for the money -- you can get a fairly nice room on the strip for $675 a weekend.  A clean room.  With a view.  Without a smoking area directly below your window.  But the Gary Allan concert was terrific and we learned an important lesson."}
{"text":"I never stay in this hotel but I always come for buffet or break time from my work !   Buffet is very cheap and delicious !  And people working here is very kind and nice !!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! ;) I always bring my ca friends here! They also love the place as well.. great price for the buffet too!"}
{"text":"Found a clump of long black hair on the bathroom floor, then found a black pubic hair in bed along with a blood stain that was not fully washed out of the sheet. I called to let the staff know about the problem at 2 pm and it was not fixed. After waiting an hour we finally just walked down to the front desk to let them know what was going on. Then after being promised it would get fixed it wasn't. I had to physically take the sheet to the front desk at 11 pm, and at that time I was called a liar and told that I only wanted comped and I could have gotten that sheet anywhere. I only wanted the bed fixed. Finally someone showed up with a clean sheet and I made the bed myself.  Also, the property itself was dirty, toilet seats in casino bathrooms were rotting and staff unfriendly. Won't be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"NOTE: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE HOTEL  Our room was in a far wing of the hotel and once you got to the Coco's Restaurant (which was nearly always empty) you could actually kind of breathe and not smell the cigarette smoke that casts a pall over the entire lobby/casino area.   Just about the only things I liked at the hotel were the Tarocco Sicilian red orange toiletries (Shampoo, conditioner and hand cream) in our room, the room's decor (tasteful and not quite dated but clearly from the 1990's) and the fact that they had a decent movie theater.  The cigarette smoke in this hotel choked us every time we entered. The pool wasn't heated and was an outdoor pool, though it looked like it would be nice if it were warmer weather. It was closed the first night we were there and too cold to get in the next day based on other guests remarks.  Our bathroom smelled like cigarettes on our last day there, like the odor was seeping through the ventilation. The beds were some of the most uncomfortable I've slept on. I woke up several times in the night with pain in my back from the sagging mattress. The 2nd night I took a sleeping pill just so I could be knocked out and get some rest it was that bad. The buffet was pretty much inedible, unless you like doughnuts and strawberry yogurt. Lots of variety, all kinds of food - but lacking in flavor of any kind. None of us liked it and teenagers will eat anything, so that's saying a lot.  It was especially sad/pathetic to see so many elderly people mesmerized by the slot machines spending away their Social Security checks, yikes!   I wouldn't stay here again unless I had to, I'm sure there are nicer places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A decent hotel at a reasonable price.  The pool is set up for kids (not very deep with a very shallow, wading pool end).  The only problem we had was smoke odor.  It was coming into the bathroom from the vent.  My brother had to switch rooms at first because the odor was so strong."}
{"text":"This place s so bad , customers service really sucks , this dealer they r bringing they personal problems to the tables , u tip them no even a thank u never again  , that dealer call Carlos so fucking rude for no reason . Special when I'm the only one tipping hem"}
{"text":"Sunset casino is my favorite local casino. The slots are fair, the live shows are frequent and ever changing( many times also free!) the buffet is busy so be prepared for a possible wait time for chow. The movie theater and bowling make it a fun place for date night and they have quite a few places to eat if the buffet isn't your style. Oyster bar, Mexican cantina, nice cafe, and \" mall food\" Sabarro, Panda Express, Fatburger, and a Ben and Jerry's near the theater."}
{"text":"Place has gone downhill fast. Not only do they NOT sell Bud products. But tables at the Bullfighter Bar are always filthy and to top it off they give you a wet towel to clean them off yourself.   I remember when this place was kept clean. Embarrassment.   Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sunset Station in Henderson the weekend of June 15-17, 2013.  We had never stayed at a Station Casino before but had heard good things about them and I can only say that our room was very nice and clean with a nice vanity area separate from the bathroom/shower room.  The employees were extremely nice and helpful and we had a great stay.  Would definitely stay there again and try other Station locations."}
{"text":"Well, it has been a very long time since I posted any reviews and we have been back to Las Vegas many times since my last one, so I have intentions of catching up!  We found Sunset Station in our constant quest for good video poker.  I had a hell of a run here, a winning streak to end all winning streaks.  We thought the place was beautiful, the casino clean and cocktail service was great.  There are good food options and we had a damn fine time.  So we decided to stay there the next time we came to Las Vegas.  This is where it gets somewhat interesting.  Of course after my huge winning streak, we were offered a free stay.  So we book it and head out.  $20 at the desk got us into a suite.  Awesome, yes?!  Not so much.  Well, it was clean.  And HUGE.  I have had smaller apartments.  MUCH smaller apartments.  But it all seemed just a little dated, except the master bath, which was huge and totally decked out.  It was nice, don't get me wrong, it was just short on windows and short on that cool hotel feeling.  Also, like many Station casinos, there were a lot of kids.  Boooooo But what wrecked the stay was the fact that the good video poker was GONE.  As in machines GONE.  We were so disappointed that we barely spent any time in the casino, opting instead to tour every single casino in a five mile radius.  Review of THOSE  will follow, for those who are interested.  So here's the takeaway:  the place is nice.  We love to split our stay between the strip and an outlying hotel and Sunset Station seemed like a great place to do that.  We will check back on the whole video poker situation because that is, after all, one of the big reasons we are in Las Vegas to begin with.  So if it returns, we will give the place another chance."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would.  I am a local, so I can not judge the rooms, but I can provide a critique on the Casino.  I have played here multiple times since my family has moved to LV(2+ years, average once every two months).  I have never asked for a comp until today & i have NEVER been treated so poorly as I was with Casino Manger \"Wayne\".  I was wagering 20$ per bet for 4+ hours to find out when I asked for dinner for two at the cafe my play only equals  a 3$ comp.  Why was the comp so low?  Cause I took the casinos' money????  Sounds plausible to me....  needless to say I turned in my players card and will never be going back.  Go to South Point where they actually appreciate players.  Sunset Station will not treat you fair unless your points are tracked via slots."}
{"text":"I received a deal to stay at this location and was very anxious for 10 great days in Vegas.  We had three issues.  1. They put us in a room and made use move a day later because they had scheduled maintenance for the 21st floor. They had to paint all the doors. So we had to pack all our belongings and move 4 floors down. We were not told about this on check-in.  We got a message on our phone on the second day. 2. They have WiFi, but you can't access it in the common area's unless you're at the hotel for a conventions. I work and it would be.great to access the Internet anywhere in the hotel. I don't mind paying extra, but it isn't an option. I turned off WiFi on my phone and computer and used my phone as a mobile hot spot.  3. They close the cafe every Sunday from 8PM to 11PM at which time they move the menu to another location in the hotel. Why don't they move the menu first, then close the cafe for 3 hours?  Overall, the employee's are very friendly, but management sucks!  I tried to contact management at least 3 or 4 times and they weren't available, so thats why I'm warning everyone on Yelp."}
{"text":"This is a \"We Love Locals\" casino, and what they really love is very old locals, not that there is anything wrong with that, if you're really old or enjoy the company of the really old.  I'm pretty old, so I'm comfortable with that.    The casino is deceptively large.  I was with my wife, and when we gamble together we play slots.  Most of the slots here are the kind that cost a lot of pennies and have about twenty-five odd characters on the screen.  Also,  there's a huge percentage of video poker machines.  We enjoy the games that have the diamonds and standard slot icons, oh, and also butterflies.  There were very few games that we played there, but we beat them pretty hard and didn't win.  Poker room looked nice, but I didn't go.  Best part of the casino was the cocktail service - adequately staffed with hard-working friendly waitresses who kept them coming.    The hotel was okay.  Front desk staff was outstanding, friendly, and competent.  We had a comp room and upgraded it online to a deluxe room.  It looked nice but instead of a king bed we had what I assumed was two queens.  It wasn't until I fell into bed with my wife that I realized they were double beds.  So for an extra $20 a night, I got a half a bed.  (Not complaining, Honey)  Other important room amenities passed the test. There were two vanity areas in the bathroom, on opposite sides of the room, so you can stare at your roommate's back side through the mirror while you're brushing your teeth.  Shower head and water pressure were good (important to me).  Toilet had a hydraulic power-flush (TMI?).    Restaurants.  We had two breakfasts at the buffet.  Buffet is incredibly inexpensive and certainly a daily stop for many locals.  Breakfast was very adequate and comparable to more expensive alternatives.  We had one dinner at the Italian restaurant, and I thought it was great.  The waiter was cool, knowledgable about his wines and the menu.  Food and wine were excellent and relatively inexpensive.  I would eat there again, but I probably won't stay there again soon, so I guess I won't eat there again.    The pool.  This was kind of weird.  They have a huge pool with a very intricate design, like a big fish.  Couple of negatives here, however.  The pool isn't heated, and there is no jacuzzi/whirlpool.  Bummer. They have a bar set up in a palapa, and the drinks were inexpensive and the bartender was very customer friendly.    Overall, the Sunset Station is pretty good.  It's not really a fun place, but it is an inexpensive place to eat, drink, and sleep.  I may give it another go in about, say, ten years."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Never stayed in the hotel but the prices are cheap and the food is good. The buffet is ok it's good for the price 6.99. Breakfast buffet 7.99 lunch 10.99 dinner can't beat that with a stick lol"}
{"text":"Stayed a week here was one of the worst hotel rooms I stayed in, in the morning you can hear the people next door farting and peeing in the toilet. The hotel staff was not that friendly. The buffet was horrible I would had rather gone to the Golden Corral. But the other restaurants inside where very good! I would not recommend staying here to anyone and oh the pool was closed too"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the price and location that this was a very clean and nice. Beds were soft but the towels and shower were a bit lacking.  I did eat at the oyster bar and the salmon was very good so over all this is a good hotel to if you were not wanting to stay on the strip."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Station casino.  I'm a frequent visitor to their sportsbook and I must say they have the best customer service out of all Station casinos when it comes to their sportsbook.    Their lunch buffet is also fairly decent considering the price tag w/ your boarding pass.  A lot of variety and usually a short wait to get seated if you go during the middle of the week.    Movie theater is also very clean and comfortable.  Have seen many movies here and I certainly would recommend this theater as it's usually not crowded at all with Fri/Sat night being the exceptions."}
{"text":"Over the last 15 years this hotel/casino has changed in many respects. The buffet offers food that is less than mediocre, variety is limited, and tastes good only if your starving. Oyster bar is okay. Cafe menu is unappealing but food is okay, the desert case when you walk in is the only highlight you'll remember. Mexican restaurant 3 of 5 stars. And other eateries in the back are convenient.   If you've been to upscale places in Vegas you notice a big difference here. If your not particular than you don't notice how terrible customer service is from servers to casino staff (valet is the best you get - at least they smile). Gaming is good for video poker (lots of machines here), but payback is almost non existent.  If a drive a little farther you'll see a difference (upscale) food tastes better, customer service is better, and you can at least walk away money in your pocket"}
{"text":"My favourite of the Station casinos. Room was nice and tight  with a 42\" flat screen. Pricey resort fee, but paid 33/night. The pool looks as if it was recently renovated. No ghetto gangster people hanging around. Another great thing about this place is the location to Wal Mart and the mall across the street."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Check in was a breeze. The staff was VERY friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to my out of town guest or to just anyone.   The room was very clean. I love the decor. I booked this room from a travel site at a discount, I definitely got my monies worth.  Only downside is resort fees. I hate paying them, but understand why they are nessessary. After seeing the room, I can definitely say I made a great choice. Just wish they had room deals for locals. Either way it was definitely worth it.  I would stay here again without hesitation."}
{"text":"The reason for 2 stars is simple...RESORT FEE. OK it's a pet peeve of mine. If I can't stay in the room without paying the RESORT FEE, it really isn't a resort fee, it is part of the room rate. So don't quote me $100 night when I make the reservation and then have me sign a paper saying that I agree to pay $116.95/night when I get there. I realize they didn't invent the resort fee, but I can't overlook the fact that they participate in this scam. I also didn't appreciate the snotty way I was treated when I questioned the fee.   Having said that, the service at the cafe was very good and so was the meal. I only needed a place to flop for the night so I don't have much to say about the hotel. It was neat, clean and quiet. If they ever decide to be honest about their pricing and dump the RESORT FEE I'll upgrade the stars. (Gasp...that's me holding by breath)"}
{"text":"Made a room reservation several weeks in advance for a non-smoking room.  Checked in on the day of the reservation at 4:30pm.  The only room available was a smoking room that they claimed was recently renovated so it would be fine.  The room was not acceptable as it smelled like an ash tray.  That is no where near what I reserved.  They offered no real solution to the problem.  KP"}
{"text":"My family and I usually stay there twice a year while on a boating trip to Lake Mead, never had a bad experience, until last weekend! While on vacation my husband and I request a smoking room, because we smoke when we drink and gamble and requested such when making our reservation. When we checked in they told us there were not any available. Now I've stayed there plenty of times and have never had this happen before, so I called down to the front desk and inquired as to why my reservation request was not filled. I find it highly unlikely that they could not figure something out, it's a very large hotel! They very snottily told me that it was based on availability and there was nothing they could do...really, then why make a reservation? Then the remote control on our TV didn't work, then the temperature gage on the shower wasn't working, either freezing cold or scalding hot, and the vent in the shower was missing so it was a disgusting dusty mess. Shortly after my scorching shower I went to get a water from the vending machine and guess what....it wasn't working! Really? After several more calls down to the front desk I realized I was wasting my time. Invest a little fixer up money on keeping things in working order and employees who aren't rude, self-important, power tripping pains in the butt!   On a far more pleasant note we dined at the Mexican restaurant and the Italian restaurant located on the property and both had fantastic food and service. The cafe was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"The 2 star rating is because of the rude female hotel operator last night. This urge me to write my very first review on yelp or else I will never waste my time. I kindly asked for an extra pillow, since I need to elevate my head due to respiratory issues but she rudely told me they are out of pillows then hang up. I was just hoping it was disconnected by accident and didn't purposely hanged up the phone. But, as an operator, she knew what room number I was in, she should have called back.  As a frequent traveller, requesting for an extra pillow has never been an issue. I don't even think that the hotel is fully packed with hotel guest that they ran out of pillows. But, on the bright side our hotel room is clean and modern. I hope that lady that ruined my night will get an extra training on how to properly communicate to their guest."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite casino.  Very quiet, very nice-looking casino.  Low minimums on blackjack and craps ($5).  Friendly dealers.  And it has many of the slot machines I like:  Invaders from the Planet Moolah, Star Trek.  They have a card system that gives you money to play with as soon as you join."}
{"text":"One Star! It's been a while since I've been out here,  but come on,  it's almost 2016 and smokers still allowed to smoke inside.  No point in having showers,  my clothes reak of cigarettes after walking anywhere through the casino,  which of course is where all the restaurants and bars are.  How about a compromise,  create an enclosed smoking area,  and keep the rest of the place smoke free! Unbelievable this is still an issue today!  I'll never stay here again!"}
{"text":"As a newcomer to the Las Vegas area, I am like a kid in an adult candy store. Drinking and gambling available 24/7?! Not to mention the fact you have to work REALLY hard to get a bad meal in the area. (Even the Chevron station by our condo makes one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.) When my counterpart--an LV native--suggested an afternoon at Station, I gladly obliged. He didn't rave about it and said it was old, but fun and LOTS to do: From bowling to gambling to eating to playing bingo, seeing a show...We would decide what to do when we got there. Not a \"strip-style\" hotel/casino, I suppose Station could be described as \"campy\" in comparison. However, upon entering a seemingly huge Old West-style haven, with very cool ambiance of ceilings painted to make the interior seem like you are outdoors in the 1800's, you do feel like you have gone back in time and have escaped, once again, whatever reality exists outside this locals treasure. Boasting friendly, attentive bartenders and very loose video poker machines (that still managed to take my money, but at least I got play for my $40), a packed keno lounge and very funny and knowledgeable attendant, plus cool promotions, Station Casino is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The Buffet at Sunset Station is Excellent!! You Will Find a Variety of Selections from all Corners of the World  Not only are the Selections Excellent, The Cashiers, The People that assist You to Your Table ( Justin) and the Servers/Wait Staff ( Manny and Will) are Very Friendly and Courteous   I Highly Recommend the Buffet at Sunset Station not only for The Food, but also All of The Excellent Staff Members that Work so Hard to Provide an Excellent Experience"}
{"text":"It's no as fancy as some strip hotels... but... you can upgrade to a king suite most nights for $100-150... which is like an apartment!  Worth it!  Makes you feel like a baller!  The casino is large- lots of variety of slots... and I win... and isn't that's what's important!?  The pool is ok... nothing fancy- but available!  The hotel amenities for families- bowling, movie theater... buffet is CHEAP!  I actually really like it here... and was surprised how much I did!!  I will be back... especially now that I'm platinum!   #comps the parking is free, valet is free, wifi included with resort fee (which is less than on the strip), atm fees are half what they are on the strip... and it's about a 15-20 minutes drive to the strip for a show.  With all this place has to offer... the drive into town is no biggie!  Winning!!"}
{"text":"This may be a place for people to stay but it really isn't anything to brag about for the locals.  All they offer is ridiculous contests, 2 for 1's in their buffet which is terribly boring.  It's really gone downhill the past few years and the machines are ridiculously tight."}
{"text":"I'm giving the hotel a strong 4 - and putting an extra star to off set some of the poor reviews I saw. I traveled to Henderson for business and clunked down 50 bucks to get a clean bed and free wi-fi the night before a meeting. As I drove up, I wasn't expecting much - the casino is meh as you walk in --but I'm not reviewing the casino. The hotel rooms are completely remodeled and I've stayed in much worse for 10 times the cost. New, modern decor, great desk staff (Kevin was really nice and very knowledgeable). If you're here for work or play - this is a GREAT, clean, remodeled room for a very good price."}
{"text":"Great hotel and Casino, however, extremely shady business practices. I was there for the CES show and booked on Travelocity. They told me there were no non smoking rooms available because Travelocity did not specify non smoking. They then proceeded to charge me an additional $25 a night for a non smoking room. I had no choice given the availability of hotels during CES week. They said if I didn't use Travelocity it would have been different. Let me clarify something, if I didn't use travelocity, this place would have not existed to me. It was Travelocity that found this low level casino in the first place..."}
{"text":"It has been my go to place since they opened. Now it is going to the dogs. Literly. They tell me only service dogs are allowed but I have seen people with dogs in baby strollers, on leashes all over the property including in the buffet."}
{"text":"I definately enjoy coming here having a few drinks and watching my husband do a little gambling.We enjoy coming here because its right down the street from us. It does seem like we have better odds here to win then on the strip and 100.00 goes a lot longer here. We have also tried a few restaurants in here and one place we love which I will.review on shortly.  Sunset Station is a wonferful and conveniently located!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner buffet here and it was excellent, lots of international dishes and all sorts of delicious dessert.  The price is excellent for the taste of the food.  By the way there is also a regal theatre inside the casino."}
{"text":"Recently stayed in a Petite Suite. The room was very average, probably priced at $100 more than what is was worth IF the  bathroom didn't have a lingering smell of cigarette smoke. This should have no way passed inspection. My stay was literally the worst I'd ever experienced in a hotel due to the heavy smoke smell in my non-smoking room. Probably should have complained, but I'll let my money talk by spending it elsewhere in the future. As for a \"recently renovated\" room?! Definitely not the bathroom, perhaps in the mid-nineties!"}
{"text":"Stay away if you can... No coffee maker, no refrigerator (addl $15 per day if you must), broken hair dryer... If you need to call reception for any question or request hair dryer replacement expect at the least 30 min wait, no joke. Spotty internet despite $15 resort fee per day!"}
{"text":"Nice location. Hotel has a bowling alley an theater. I gave it a 3 star on based on my room. Wall paper peeling in bathroom. Our sink was backed up. Bed was lop sided the frame was to big for box spring so the staff came and slid a board under bed to hold it up. Lock on bathroom door broken, lock on front door had loose screws. When I looked under bed to investigate the box spring I found some trash.  Room 810"}
{"text":"If we could give it 0 stars we would. After playing on the strip we checked into here to be closer to family! To start the service was terrible rude ppl working there whom acted as if they hated it there. We checked in and out the next day yet because of there extremely tight slot play 3 dollar bet get you .60 in bonus money after 15 free spins? And that was all night long! We checked out the next day yet were charged for one night that was not comp. we were not even in the hotel that week had checked out 4 days prior talked to Laurie \"casino manager\" assured us we would get a call back never did called back talked to Steve who said Laurie was not a \"manager\" we should have never dealt with her he would take care of it. Spent our week vacation trying to call and take care of charges! To make things worse our last day we had to go there ourself to take care of it because they all have there heads up there asses! We forgot a pair of dress pants in our room they made us run around hotel to get them because in the name of good customer service security was to lazy to walk them to the front desk for us. Our family lives in Vegas after this they swore off any station casino as did we when we visit again! We stayed at SLS on strip within a week are \"elite members\"with host. So obvious this is stations loss funny thing is they don't give a crap! There hard up for your money folks going as far to charge for things they shouldn't and there service is crap! Run don't walk from this place hit a jackpot at SLS not a chance u will have the same fun in this rundown hell hole!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT VALET!! LOWEST QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are very dishonest. They will damage your car and not say anything, hoping you wouldn't notice... and if you don't notice the damage while on property, you're out of luck. Unluckily for me. They basically say screw you. I valet there, tipped the guy $10 then got home and noticed my car had deep scratches on my bumper so I called as soon as I noticed the damaged but the valet supervisor doesn't even come in until 5pm, (which I find ridiculous! How are you going to have your employees unsupervised? There should've been a supervisor at all times, at least one because guess what? I called back and no one picked up. Didn't get a hold of him til the following day and now they are blaming me that I \"should've notified them ASAP\". Like wow, RIDICULOUS! So I got my insurance involved and I also spoke to the hotel insurance adjuster, Pam Rivela (horrible attitude, very rude, not helpful AT ALL) and she told me that they cannot do anything about the damaged because the car left the property and I have no proof that it happened at their valet, (which I understand, BUT... WHAT IF I CAN PROVE IT BY REVIEWING SURVEILLANCE CAMERA?) then I told her to check surveillance camera, but she refused (which again, sucks for me because that's my only way of proving it happened there). I also asked her that if I file a police report, would they be able to release the video to the police, she also said no. Overall, this has been a very upsetting event for me. Specially the way these people have treated me while trying to handle this situation. If this happened to you before I would very much like to get in touch because I can't believe they are getting away with this. I honestly hope they get their karma tenfold"}
{"text":"bowling alley,movie theater(w/imax),nice bars and restaurants. Fatburger in the food court,slots that actually pay out! I may stay on the strip but I start my Vegas trips with a couple of nights here when in town for supercross or monster energy cup! Also i can see my vehicle from my room and security is always patrolling also."}
{"text":"This review is specifically towards the Sunset Station pool and its lack of management and common sense.   My family and I stayed at Sunset Station over the 4th of July weekend. I have stay here many times in the past and have never had an issue until now. Part of the reason we chose this hotel was because of the kid friendly pool.   First off, when I called to book a cabana I asked for a specific one that is located by the shallow end of the pool. Cabana #5. I have a toddler and this cabana is closest and doesn't have an obstructed view of The shallow end of the pool. I was told that wouldn't be a problem to get.   When we got there we were told that one (Cabana #5) was already reserved. The cabana we got impeded our view from being able to see the kids in the shallow end. I let this go and went along with the day.   The bartender suggested we upgrade our package to include a bucket of beer and two appetizers as this would be a better value. We agreed and then she showed us to the cabana and went back to the bar. Not once did she come over to get a drink or food order from us. Which is annoying in itself, but what made it worst was that gratuity was added onto our bill that was paid upfront. So she was paid $30 to basically show us where the cabana was. Not to mention my husband tipped every time he went to the bar, as there was more than one bartender.  Every time we wanted drinks we had to go to the bar and get them. No menu was in the cabana or service to get us one so once again we had to go to the bar to order. She did however drop off the food which was in two styrofoam boxes and came with two styrofoam plates. The food was not hot, not even warm and overall not good.  Later that day I called to speak to someone in management. My phone number was forwarded to the pool manager, Jerry. When I spoke with Jerry and explained everything. He basically told me how there was bad communication between the hotel and pool staff. How he has been trying to get a server for the cabanas, but has had no luck. I tried to be understanding, but at the end of the day I really didn't feel this was or should be the customers problem. 2 bartenders to take care of the entire pool area and approximately 10 cabanas is ridiculous. Especially on 4th of July weekend. Jerry offered to get us a cabana that day, a pizza, and a bucket of beer. I explained that we hadn't planned on going to the pool and that we had made other plans. He said if we did go to pick up a house phone and call him. At around 1:00 we did decide to go to the pool. A lifeguard called him and when he arrived he said, \"I'm Jerry. What's up?\" Strange introduction, but okay.   There were no cabanas available (understandable) but he offered a pizza and bucket of beer. I asked if we could get water and said we didn't want the pizza at this moment. I said, what should I do if I need something and he said to call him again. Again, strange. Why not just set us up with a server or give us a tab at the bar. Make it easy for us instead of trying to track down a house phone whenever we needed something.   About 20 minutes later he came by with a bartender and she off the bat came at me in a very agitated manner. Saying, \"I must have walked past you 75 times, but whatever and if you needed anything you could have hollered out me to HONEY I would have been happy to help!\" I was so confused. I had only been at the pool for about 30 minutes (in which she had never walked past me) and she wasn't even working on the previous day when we had the problem with the cabana service. I explained this to her and her exact response was, \"Oh sike! I didn't come in until late afternoon yesterday. \" No apologies and the manager (Jerry) didn't correct her. Who responds with \"oh sike\" when they're wrong? At this point I was so upset I told them to just go and leave me alone.   We ended up leaving early. I WILL NEVER return to the Sunset Station.  What a shame. It's like the blind leading the blind down there. Totally unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Went to the buffet here recently, I had never been here, and have been raving to my friends and family about the service and food! I will definitely be going back for the salad bar and those amazing omelets!! Our server Yvette Viator was so great, she was on top of everything! If you go there, ask for her section! You won't be sorry! Great job! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Well I'm leaving the hotel tomorow morning so I guess I'm technically still a guest, but oh well haha.  Beds are pretty comfortable, the shower has decent room and water pressure [I hate when hotel showers just drip, it's annoying n difficult], n my only complaint is that they have the cheapest toilet paper is the world--wtf is that about?  To get to the pool, get in the side entrance, n use the elevators requires your room key. Kinda weird in my opinion but I guess that's a good idea so random people can't just wander into the hotel or pool area. So safety-wise, a plus.  Oh, n there's a Starbucks on the Casino floor sooooo there are NO coffee pots in the hotel rooms and NO refrigerators. Kinda random. At least you have one of those ice cups if you wanna run down the hall to get ice for an ice chest or somethin.  Buffet style eating here is pretty good. They have a whole section for sugar-free deserts if you're concerned about that kinda thing. The buffet line is split into each type of food: Asian, Americana, Mexican, n Dessert!  Our hotel room was on a non-smoking floor which was nice. But there are also floors that allow smoking.....but if you smoke on a non-smoking floor there's a sign that says there will be a $100 violated fee haha so don't do it.  The pool in the back area of the hotel is about three feet deep but it's designed pretty cool almost like the edge overflows kinda like a fountain.  Hooter's, Regal Cinema's, n a bowling alley are attached to the hotel/casino. There's plenty of places around like Walmart n Target or Walgreen's to go get anything you might need outside of the hotel close by. Convenience is always great.  Overall, it's a good place to stay. Good for families n whoever else wants to stay. Oh n by the way, the downstairs casino area is decorated like it's outdoors---reminded me of an old Disneyland ride lol fake sky n etc!"}
{"text":"We flew into Vegas to enjoy a great concert held at the Sunset Station in Henderson.  The hotel was wonderful. Service for the most part was great.  But let this be a BiG warning.  If you have not rented your own vehicle and are depending uon taxi service from the airport and back..."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this hellhole it takes about 2 hours to get a single drink. Then the waitresses walk past you like you're invisible. Thanks sunset station! Never go there."}
{"text":"The rooms here are nice and the pool area is beautiful, only the price is higher than others around the area for not much more. It is located next to the galleria Mall and has a Walmart next to it. So if you want to stay at a nice place and want to go shopping this is in a great location for that."}
{"text":"Quite a nice casino and hotel far off the strip. Went here for the buffet as I had a 2 for 1. Reasonably priced regardless. Selection was fairly good and food was tasty. Waitress was very friendly and attentive. The casino area is quite novel and uniquely themed. The only issue I had was the rather unfriendly and pissy old witch at the rewards center. I'm surprised she hasn't been vetted out yet."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!   The food is Awsome. The staff Rocks. I left money behind in a machine the other night and Security and Alfredo from Slots found it, AMAZING. This casino is big and beautiful and everyone here is super polite and kind and I feel very protected at Sunset and will be back. :)"}
{"text":"My first time to a Hooters and I was happy with my wings (bbq) and the service was good (Bre)."}
{"text":"I love the hotel and the casino. Beds are comfy, pillows stink. For $250 a night you should have \"Oprah's Best\". But over all I love this place."}
{"text":"Where do i start. I have stayed here many times and have no problems but this visit. I checked into my room and the floor was dirty trash everywhere, stains on the floor and on the wall. I talked to the blonde lady at the front desk and she was rude, i mean RUDE. So we headed to the pool, kill time to get another room \"ready\" and we were in for about half hour and the health department shut it down, due to there is only 1 life guard on duty. WTF? So now we pay for their staff not being there?? We got to the fronk desk once again and she is so rude and never says sorry for your inconvenience, nothing. Then she deactivated our key so we couldnt get in the elevator or get in our room. After 3, yes 3 tries talking to the front desk (pointless) we get in our new room. To end it with a bang we hear power tools and construction in the rooms next to us thatthey are remodeling. I am so disappointed with this hotel and staff and the way customers are treated."}
{"text":"Hotel was clean. Rooms were great. Didn't like that you needed to show your key card to use the hotel elevators... Made the hotel feel as though they have a security issue. The casino floor was nice. Nice slots and great drink specials. Enjoyed there was a bowling alley, movie theater, casino, hotel, and many places to eat... Very convenient. Food buffets are inexpensive and needs a little improvement, but would still eat there again."}
{"text":"The front desk customer experience was great!! However, This is an old persons hotel/casino catering to smokers. I would not recommend this place to anyone under 55 looking for a Vegas experience. Also not very family friendly. Arcade and a pool, hit or miss if the pools open, was all that Id recommend. The kids play zone was described by my 11 year old as a dungeon. The room rates were higher then the advertised value rates. The hotel elevators were a distance from the entertainment and casino areas. I did appreciate the security and there vigilance, well done!!"}
{"text":"Clean rooms, decent prices.  Great shows.  Love the bowling alley.  Restaraunts am great.  And great bars"}
{"text":"Well, this is one of my favorites casinos in Las Vegas. . .  even to take a coffee at starbuks, take a lunch at subway, or at buffet and, wy not? to Play a little roulette and slots . . ."}
{"text":"Love sunset buffet , always great service and food is awesome. Usual go 2-3 times a week . Prices are great."}
{"text":"The staff, except for the front desk, are very friendly, ewelcoming, & attentive. The front desk staff are rude, sarcastic, & act like they're doing you a favor, instaed of understanding that the customer is the reason they're they & who pay their wages.  The rooms are okay, but the bathrooms need updates. The sink in my room was a harvest gold model from the 90's & ran very slow, even though the stopper could not be closed.  The mattress needs to be changed in Room 917, I almost rolled off the bed because it leaned to one side. The room never really got comfortably warm. I turned the temp to 76 & the HVAC unit was still blowing cold air. The towels are thin & rough & they only give you one washcloth.   The food for the business meetings was good & the servers are great.  The casino is dated with old machines & it has a moldy smell."}
{"text":"Absolute worst hotel I've ever stayed at. I've had better rooms and customer service at motel6. I arrive get told they only have smoking rooms (even though I didn't book a smoking room). Then I get offered to be upgraded but with no discount for the inconvenience. Then I get to my room and and it is dirty (sheets stained, dental floss in the bathtub and a penny on the floor which my one year old found and tried to eat. Then their bar triple charges me. Then their vending machine quadruple charges my wife. I wish I could give them negative stars that's how much of trashy worthless place this is."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most disgusting hotel experience ever!  The water out of the tap is like black mud!  Almost everybody that works here is unfriendly, miserable, slow, lazy, and indifferent! The entire management team should be fired, they do not know how to manage staff, address issues, or provide customer service.  I would certainly not bathe, drink the water, or eat the food here!"}
{"text":"So far this trip has been horrendous.  Checked in and had made reservation for a walk in shower because of my broken leg. Was told room was not ready, they would call waited an hour no call even though she had already taken my credit card and charged it, when I went to the front desk I went to the handicapped counter and explained about the room and the RUDE Brooke front desk clerk, told me I had to just get in line and wait my turn.  I asked for the general manager and she handed me a card.  I get to my room and it is not what I requested so I call the general manager Adwar and he says he will call me right back, about 35 minutes later I call him and he is looking for another room, finally sends the bellman with new keys but neglected to inform him that he needed to move our luggage. When I mentioned to him about Brooke, he said I was standing right there when u came up, I responded really then why did she say she was all alone,you were not there.You did not even come out of the back until we left, I know why Brooke is so rude the hotel manager taught her customer service skills.   Did not want to hear any bad things about her. Will finish stay but not again.  Horrible, horrible rude staff at front desk."}
{"text":"Far from the crowds on the strip or downtown. This casino/resort caters to locals in a good way. The buffet is tops. I've stayed here several times while in LV. I love the look and feel of the casino floor, very chill and relaxed. The room are fabulous and well worth the rates, which BTW, are some of the best in the valley. My only downside with the rooms are there are no safes. But at the hotel desk they offer free safety deposit boxes. Problem solved."}
{"text":"Based only on cashing checks at the cashier: easy, fast, do it on Sunday. Comes with a drink ticket and a spin on the payday wheel. I have yet to hit for $10k, buti always cadh in the drink ticket for a water on the way out.   A+"}
{"text":"This IS the place to go if you are a family or momma with kids and need a get away. PROS: 1.  Pool starts at like 1 inch deep-perfect for babes.  There's shady spots, and yummy food service poolside!  There's spots to play all around the pool like little inlets and islands. 2. There is AWESOME child care-like Disney for kids....leave them for an hour and lay by the pool solo. $10/hr ****KIDS MUST HAVE SOCKS OR THEY MAKE YOU BUY THEM***** 3.  The bowling alley ROCKS!  Again, socks required. 4.  IT is so close to great restaurants if you don't want to eat at the buffet!!   5.  Drinking water in the gift shop is 1/3 the price at the pool.  CONS: 1. Not very wheel chair friendly, you walk for a while to get to the rooms, but I didn't mind...just if you are in a wheel chair or cane-it might get on your nerves. 2. Smoking, there is smoking in the casino-so that is a bit intense... 3. THE CAB IS $50 from the airport!?!?!  Rent a car-it's cheaper. 4. Drinking water by the pool is $5"}
{"text":"My grandma invited my friends and I to the buffet here after a long drive from LA. This place is pretty damn huge.  The buffet is impressive. They have different section of different types of food like Italian, American, International, etc. Not to mention the food was on point.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I needed reservations for a party of 30 at their Feast Buffet on short notice (24 hours). I talked to Robert and he was able to schedule a semi-private area with tables reserved just for our party. He also gave me the names and phone number of the other 2 managers that would be on duty that day Steve and Edward. Between the coordination of the 3 of them everything went well. Thank You!"}
{"text":"The Sunset Station is a really good hotel, with many amenities for the entire family.  The rooms are spacious and clean, and the bowling alley and kids quest day care are perfect for the kids.  But what makes this place great is the food.  The restaurants are amazing!  You must try the Oyster Bar and the Italian restaurant, too.  The prices are reasonable, and the service is excellent.  Overall, for the value, this is a terrific place to stay in the Vegas area with the family."}
{"text":"It saddens me terribly right now to give such a low rating to this hotel, when the hotel was actually awesome. The rating is so low due to the customer service my friends and I received from the pit boss during Sunday morning (6/2/13) blackjack session. My softball team and I all stayed at Sunset Station for a softball tourney that we had about 10 miles away. The price was right and we had a teammate who was a high roller at this casino. The food and service the restaurant was great, and the customer service in the gift shop was excellent as well. The problem arrived when 3 friends and I sat down early Sunday morning, money and drink in our hands to play $5 blackjack. The dealers Nana and Leissle were happy to have a change of pace and to play with 4 girls excited and eager not only to tip but to celebrate our winnings together. The cocktail waitresses also enjoyed our company. We sat at this table For at least 3 hours while the pit boss Ralph continued to tell us we were too loud?!?!!?! As the 4th hour approached us, my friend and I hit a 3rd blackjack in a row betting a $25 hand and we all screamed in excitement. The PitBoss Ralph- then decided to kick myself and my friend out for being too loud! When I asked for a manager, they brought over a large security guard named Mark to escort us out. As we tried to reason with them, I kindly and cooperatively asked to speak with a manager. They denied me the rights to speak with a manager then Mark put his hands on me and told me he would call the cops. I then asked to speak to his manager. After two more security guards came over and our friends were in tears and we had all been denied the right to speak to a manager they denied us yet again and asked us  to fill out a comment card! Even one of the cocktail waitresses walked over to explain to the security guard that we were doing nothing wrong. The security guards then warned us they had called the police and they were on their way. We exited the casino immediately after that. I will never stay here again, nor will my team or anyone I know. I will be calling to speak with a manager and because I left my name and number I am expecting ad waiting for someone to call me!!! Worst customer service and Las Vegas and overall casino experience I have ever had. Be aware and do not stay there. The rooms are cheap, but at what cost!!! You have no rights, and no respect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to drop off your extra money! Honestly, I like the place, food is good, movies, bowling, good atmosphere. Right in the neighborhood. Wifey addicted to the machines so what can I say!"}
{"text":"I regrettably give the sunset station and the station casinos such a low grade.  I actually attended my final  three years of high school at Green valley high just 1 minute from this resort and a have a great deal of pride in Henderson, it's communities, and it's businesses.  However when booking this reservation R-2132471934, I requested a king bed and double checked with separate sources only to get to the check in desk late night Thursday after a super busy week to get a queen.  Now this may seem small but with rates that would have allowed me to stay on the strip I would imagine bed types would be a guarantee, Especially because I'm 6'2 and 2 people on this small queen left my feet hanging off of the bed for the entire three days.  Besides all of this, at check in we attempted to explain the need for a larger bed but the less than curtious check in lady didn't even care.  I don't know if I will stay with the station casinos again."}
{"text":"This year we stayed at Sunset Station with relatives for 5 days, 4 nights.  We've been coming here for years and always enjoy the ambiance and the slot variety.  The rooms are aging a bit and we had trouble with getting hot water late at night.  They've improved their check in process from last visit and we were able to get into our room early without standing in long lines.  Prices for buffet meals are very cheap with $4.99 for breakfast and $9.99 for dinner.  You need a slot club card but it's only takes a few minutes to get one.  We even like the small taco stand next to the Mexican restaurant.  The buffet food is standard but choices are many and you won't go hungry.  I've never had a problem with excess smoke in the casino so I find that complaint puzzling.  I don't smoke so I notice things like that right away.  Of course sitting next to a bunch of smokers will do it but I move away and I'm fine.  There are some annoying features like the $14.99 \"service charge\".  You have to ask for a refrigerator, we have a diabetic, but it was taken care of immediately by housekeeping.  The Grand Cafe says it's open 24/7 but it isn't.  From 10pm to 6AM there isn't anyone there at all.  10PM seems a little early to close.  Starbucks closes at 10 also so if you want something have to get there early.    The interior is very nice and spacious with high ceilings and a magnificent central bar designed by Gaudi with lots of beautiful stained glass.  If you walk all the way around and back to the hotel tower, it's a major trek.  Lots and lots of slot machines everywhere, bingo room, kid's quest area for the children, movies, fast food like Fatburger and Ben & Jerrys, and even a giant bowling alley.  We've enjoyed the oyster bar in the past.  Never have done the steakhouse  though.  You can earn points quickly here in the slot club.  This trip our room was comped all four days.  You are away from the strip if that bothers you.  It's a very short drive on 215 to anywhere on the strip by car and only 17 minutes to the airport.  I know cause I had to drive there a lot to pick up people and take them back.  And for you shopping fiends, there is a giant mall right across the street from the casino.  One side trip down Sunset Road east from the casino was to Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden.  It's FREE and has a giant chocolate gift shop, go figure, with any kind of chocolate you may want.  We have photographers in our group and they loved the garden too.  So it's worth a trip for you chocoholics.  The service isn't as good as say Harrahs in Temecula but we still love the place and the rooms are very reasonable for our out of state visitors."}
{"text":"I love this casino. I always have a good time and I don't often have to wait long for drinks. Plus it has plenty for kids to do, such as Kids Quest which my daughter loves. It's a bit noisy since they have the radio going plus the jackpot announcements AND live music all at once. Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"What a great family friendly hotel our kids had a blast! There is a movie theater, bowling and arcade for the whole family ."}
{"text":"Let me begin by stating that the Sunset Station is my home away from home...literally. I once spent 3 weeks in a row here while on an extended business trip. With that said, the Sunset Station has plenty to offer and kept me entertained , even while couped up in the same hotel for almost a month.   The rooms are nice and big, though a little dated (The hotel hallways feel a little like the lodge in the movie \"The Shining\" to me. I fully expected to see those creepy twins pop out at any time). The price for rooms is very reasonable, especially during the week. Do be aware of the \"Hotel Amenity Fee,\" which is automatically added to the room price. It is usually in the neighborhood of $15 per night and will give you access to the hotel Wi-Fi in your room among other things.   The casino is great in my opinion. It has one of those fake sky ceilings, which gives the whole place a more airy feel. The look of the place is modeled after a Spanish/Barcelona setting. The best part is the Gaudi Bar in the middle of the casino, where all the table games are located. Modeled after the architecture of its namesake, it creates a very pleasing environment to lose money.  The dealers are very friendly.  The Sunset Station is more than a casino, with several restaurants, a movie theater, bowling alley, and even a huge play area to drop the kids off at while you go gamble away their college funds.  I recommend this place to all my friends and family when visiting the Las Vegas/Henderson area."}
{"text":"I filed a complaint  against  an employee  who was rude and  unprofessional  with me. The manager  addressed the  issue with me  and  made things  right, however the following month  all of my hard earned  offers and  promotions were mysterious  taken away from me. I  contacted the  players club and women stuttered and  stammered until she finally  admitted  I should  be  receiving  offers. She addressed it with her superiors who gave her some lame  story  about it being  based on quarterly  averages. Really?  So how  does my wife who plays less than I do still have her offers? Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Great casino and buffett.  Great value for your money and good selection of machines, lots of $5 Blackjack tables."}
{"text":"Booked a room via phone. You cannot make a reservation through the hotel directly, you have to call a central reservation line, which is somewhere in India. With the language barrier, the information taken  was incorrect, never received a confirmation number because they spelled the last name wrong and incorrect email. However they did get the credit card number correct. Get to the front desk, apparently the central reservation and the front desk do not communicate and are not on the same page or computer system as far as information. They had no idea what our room rate was or the confirmation number, apparently we booked through a third-party, even though we were transferred to the central reservation center by the hotel. The hotel and central reservation have two different confirmation numbers. When signing the reservation form they want you to initial the rate which was nowhere listed on the form. We booked for a Sunday night, arrived at 11pm at $110. Ridiculous! The front desk told us that the rates depend on availability, there was literally nobody here!! It's Sunday, you know, the cheaper rate days Sunday-Thursdays? Gambling was a bust. Drinks at the bar were so-so, the bartender Heather was pleasant. Never once saw waitress on the floor. Looks like the place has a lot of amenities, the room was nice, and looks like there are nice places to eat. Nothing here would entice me to come back. I've read other reviews, some love the place, some do not. It's a crap shoot! No pun intended."}
{"text":"I love Sunset Station.  I used to live near here and would come here to see movies, dine out, and even gamble now and then.  There is also an arcade and bowling alley.   I like that they have a little non smoking section with slots, although I wish it was larger and with more machines."}
{"text":"One night stay-cation and I have to say, not bad! Room was about $40 minus extra fees and it was decent. No smoke odor and was clean. Took the kids to the nice sized pool and bowling afterwards. Lots of restaurants nearby and shopping mall across the street. By the way if you have a boarding pass they have great meal deals after midnight at the cafe. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because toilet was acting up but not a big deal. It was a pleasant one night stay and all that matters is the kids had fun!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever  the waiter john was terriable .I order a patty melt  med well it came our med it still was med than instead of fixing his mistake I didn't get my burger he just took it off the bill"}
{"text":"It's okay for dining, but if you enjoy having a few drinks while playing slots...the machines are tight, payouts are low... it's difficult getting drinks in a timely manner. I actually had to go to the bar and pay $3.50 & tip for a beer after sitting at the same machine gambling for 45 minutes. When questioned -all the staff covers for each other, \"oh their changing shift\"...my goodness they don't have to give report to the oncoming shift. I love when the reassure you there are plenty waitresses on the floor..well they must be hiding!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for dining, gambling, movie watching, electronic bingo, bowling.....I guess that is a lot of stuff to do in one place!  Sunset is a great place for locals to hand out!"}
{"text":"These guys upgraded me to a king suite.  They didn't say why but I think it is because the front desk noticed I was a veteran. (My driver's license states it.) Either way it was cool! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The buffet at sunset station Is excellent, Super inexpensive for 9.99$ per person. Everyone in the service team was excellent."}
{"text":"It's tight in here today you all! I have heard of making money, but ripping people off is another standard.!"}
{"text":"Love this Casino!! Nice and clean. The buffet is delicious and affordable.  Every slot machine you like to play is here and new ones too."}
{"text":"Great fun after voting at the polls. Cool atmosphere nice to watch the game on several different TV"}
{"text":"I love Sunset. Very convenient for a local. I love the Gaudi bar's decor. They have a great buffet for the price! BTW, I haven't stayed in a hotel room."}
{"text":"This is the first time we went to Vegas and when we booked this hotel through Southwest, we really didn't know what to expect.   The hotel was probably 25 minutes drive from downtown Vegas. We liked it here though. It was not crowded like in downtown so the kids can get some rest.   We booked two rooms, one for us and one for the grandparent. Each was a two queen size petites something (Lol! I forgot what the room called!). But the size of the room was AMAZING! It was huge. Perfect for us since we are a family of five.   The room was cleaned. One thing that I found it strange, after we checked in, room service called and asked if we need a fridge. Apparently, the hotel will provide the fridge only if you ask them. And since we were spending time outside the hotel, we told them that we didn't need it.  The ladies that cleaned the room were super nice. They always asked us if we need anything in the room. So the room service was definitely a plus.   Although I didn't really like the front desk people, they were so rude. It felt like they don't want to work there.  The hotel itself has plenty restaurant. It even has a theater (well, I guess all the hotels in Vegas are like that!).   We would love to stay here again if we ever go to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Pool is large, beautiful and there are plenty of cabanas and seating. Front desk agents were always happy, polite, professional and prompt.  The cafe downstairs is your standard diner, nothing fancy but descent food fairly priced. My family stayed there for 4 days and it was a good experience. One big downside was the ac system in the room. It seemed dated. It was loud and rather than cooling the room quietly and subtly it was blasting cold air like a wind tunnel on one side of the room. I had to tell my kids to stay away from that side because if you walked over you'd feel the cold air blowing directly on your legs. It's 90° outside and three of us caught colds after the first night in our room. Not awesome."}
{"text":"nice decent hotel, haven't stayed here but played the games, ate at the buffet and watched a movie here!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite off the strip casino. Has it all, good food, bowling, movies..."}
{"text":"Our main go to casino! It's very large on the Inside and has a pretty good variety of restaurant's, but sad to say we just learned that they closed the Cabo location here! But all in all, the buffet is a great deal,  but not the best, but still a great deal. Gaming floor is always clean, lots of games, and they show the UFC fights, for a charge!"}
{"text":"I couldn't deceide wheter to give this hotel a 3 or 4 star.  Let's say it's a 3,5 star.  We come here for a couple of years now and there are a few reasons why we keep coming back:  1.  We hate the strip.  We love the greater area of Las Vegas, but just avoid the touristy, fake, want to take all your money strip as much as possible (there are some places to eat we love though).  Sunset Station is far far away from all that sh.... 2. We started to hate downtown hotels to.  Years ago, Fremont street was a good alternative to stay.  It wasn't as busy, especially during weekdays.  Hotels were cheaper, well just a good value.  If you know where to go, you can find good eats there.  And when gambling you don't spend as much as you would on the strip. 3. Even though you might think it's rather remote, it really isn't.  It's minutes away from the airport and car rental terminal.  Using the highway you're pretty quickly downtown.  It's close to the outlet mall (formerly known as Belz).  Galleria is accross the street.  Not to far from downtown Henderson, where the absloute cool bar 'Gold Mine Tavern' is located.  I think you get the point here... 4. Plenty of activities under one roof: there's bowling, movie theatre, Hooters (is that an activity?), of course gambling (still 1c video poker), a pool... 5. It's a bit more expensive then Downtown hotel rooms, but a lot cheaper then a room on the strip. 6. Plenty of places to eat in the surrounding area.  Now for the downsides:  1. You need a car.  I know most people will have a car, but I do now that there are Europeans who come to Vegas the first time will not rent a car and getting around in cabs.  It's simple: if you don't have a car, don't stay here or you will spend a fortune on cabs or spending your entire vacation in this hotel. 2. We come here for several years now (twece a year) and the hotel is showing some 'age issues'.  It's still OK, but they should consider renovation anytime soon. 3. Don't forget there's a RESORT FEE of 14,95$ a night no matter how you book your room!!!  Every website mensions it, but it's easy to miss.   As you can see, we have more reasons to come here then to book some place else.  Wheter you want to book a room here or not depends on what you expect from a stay in vegas and what you expect from a hotel room."}
{"text":"Its a vegas casino, there is really nothing special, it has a movie theater, some average casino food and an average vegas hotel."}
{"text":"What a great place to stay!!! Awesome service from the hotel staff, casino and valet service. I definitely recommend staying here. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"so this casino is off the strip... but if you want to see a concert their, uh PLEASE go somewhere else.. Does not matter if you are inside the venue or outside in the open air venue.. The Concert Natzi's are everywhere.. We have   been to over a dozen concert outside... You are not allowed to get in the aisle and dance... or try and take a photo closer than your assigned seat.. Even the Entertainer was begging for the audience to get a little \"wild\" and NOPE, the \"security\" will make you sit down, shut up and stop dancing.... Trust me when I say we are NOT wild people at all, just like to move a bit to our favorite entertainers..  Oh and if you are inside... it it just as bad.. They stalk you, watch if you are taking photo's or videos.. I had a brand new phone, I do not take pics with it much and am still figuring it out.. I have a touch screen and the video/pic button are very touchy.. I accidentally slid my finger on the record button and oh my God, call the national guards out.. un trust me... I would not have wanted to rewatch this entertainer again.. they were free tickets we won..the show was okay, but what these security natzi's did not know,  was that at our table was the family of the entertainer and these security natzi's were hassleing them too about their picture taking.. UH I think their folks and agents can do what ever they want... If possible, please see your entertainers else where.. You will have no fun at this casino.. The security folks think they are REAL cops.. NOT... just old people who need to retire.."}
{"text":"Gonna have to give this place 3 STARS, first and foremost the service was great, and the rooms where nicely done, so much so that we decided to stay an extra night, then another extra night, security there is great in watching over things especially folks vehicles. The down side is that they kept our $200 deposit for nearly a week, they charge $100 per deposit yes, but as I mention we stayed additional days which required new deposits, everything else was paid for even the resort fees. Here's the thing about Las Vegas hotels and casinos, their charge for resort fee's is (HIGHWAY ROBBERY) to the public. They need to waive them fee's for folks who don't use them extra amenities, as I don't recall seeing grandpa down there in the gym bench pressing weights. This is why Dubai beats Las Vegas hands down, they don't charge ridiculous resorts fee's and on top of that some of their 3 STAR hotel rooms are better than Vegas 5 STAR hotel rooms, I'm just saying peace out...from the Bahamas baby."}
{"text":"Though I had a very rough time with this place my first stay, I have tried it again almost a year later and I would say my stay was great! The room was nice, the casino has plenty to offer. We ate at a restaurant named Cabo in the casino, and it was delicious! The movies are great! My only complaint is it shows that the chairs are recliners online but they are not, so the seats are a little uncomfortable. The room was good and quiet, the air didn't work very well. All in all, it was a good stay and I'm glad I chose to give it a second chance!"}
{"text":"Love this hotel, very clean & rooms clean also   & friendly staff & kid friendly too.. Lots of thing too do for kids .. & there buffi great also.. We will be here next year with our whole basketball team!!! For Fab 48 tournament .. Thanks. Sunset for making us feel welcomed ..."}
{"text":"nice hotel. clean, well kept, recently renovated rooms! all except one thing, County Jail has better showers.. c'mon guys.. clean it up!"}
{"text":"The air quality in this casino is poor, super smoky probably because it's an older hotel/casino the ventilation isn't good.   Looked nice inside though."}
{"text":"Just checked in for our stay here and Kylie was so sweet and helpful. She was so accommodating and took great care of us! Employees like this that take the initiative and go the extra mile to make a customer happy are the employees that every employer should look to hire. Thank you Kylie and Sunset! So looking forward to our stay here this weekend and our stays in the future!"}
{"text":"Well to start when I checked in at 3:45 I was told that my room wasn't ready because I was only staying one night, although check-in is at 3PM. So, after my husband argued with the lady they suddenly had a room available....and it was  not very clean. Bought some bleach for tub because it looked pretty gross and I sanitized surfaces. Never again will I stay here...I'll stick to the higher end hotels, not worth the savings. Thank goodness it's only one night."}
{"text":"Went here for bowling.  I thought they had plenty of lanes, the service was good and they accomodated a pretty large group of 20 people fairly easily.  We ordered pizza and drinks which was of average quality but about what I would expect from a bowling alley.  It's not as nice as some newer lanes in the Vegas valley but it's convenient and usually not as packed as some of the other lanes."}
{"text":"Love their bartenders; Brenda and Sosa. I used to go here every Friday to gamble a little and drink but they added different bands to the bar over by Starbucks and I do not enjoy any of them. (I gave it a couple tries before changing bars.) They have the casino music and the band playing at the same time. And honestly, I would prefer the casino pop/rock music. The live band is annoying, when they leave I'll come back. Sorry."}
{"text":"We went to Sunday brunch. If y get a players card (free) it is 10 bucks with drink!!! Food wSs really good. Chicken fried steak, fresh sliced turkey, ham, and prime rib. The desert area had sugar free and dairy free options. Some of the food was lacking salt, but I appreciate that BC u can season to your liking. The egg rolls in the Asian area were good. My wife liked the waffle, pancake and a French toast. I myself was adventurous  with souls food, Greens, mashed potatoes fried chicken and was not disappointed. This is a buffet for everyone. A great variety of soups/fresh fruits and salad, healthy options, basic Mexican food (done right) and good sweet stuff.  The downside. The line to pay took forever, but was way worth it. Once inside we were seated promptly, our server was on task and smart it was worth every penny and it will be a must stop from now on."}
{"text":"I am getting ready to stay here for the 3rd time in the last 45 days, for a business trip.  I have to give a shout out to some great customer service, first off Jorge, the front desk manager for making my stay comfortable and very accommodating, Johnny, the new guy in reservations who did a fabulous job and was fun to talk to and lastly, Candace in rewards, who lined me up with a host to get me set up, also who shared the same first name as me, she was very friendly and joked about our name.  Thank you all for being relational people and remembering to make great experiences for people!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here to check it out and it's actually a lot nicer than expected! A lot of the inside is remodeled. Huge hotel great for families because it obviously has the casino floors for the adults and they also have an arcade, bowling lanes and theater for the children! A bit far from the strip, but if you don't mind it's a good hotel. Only thing that disappointed us was because it was so crowded, there weren't enough table games so we left for another casino"}
{"text":"Sunset Station Casino and all the other Station Casinos are the Very Worst Casinos for gamblers!! They will take every dime you have!! Not a few...Everything you have and I have visited hundreds of times...In two years I have only won one lousy jackpot of $1200 out of $80,000 ( How I know this is because every dollar equals one point on the players card and I  am about to hit another 40,000 points ) which doesn't include all the times I don't play with the card....They Do Not care that you are loyal!! They Do Not care about you period!! The only thing that matters to them is that you show up and kindly donate your money! It doesn't matter what you do or what you play...I'm as Expert gambler...as you're going to get! ( I have a laptop full of jackpot pics from California Indian Casinos. ) I have won $15,000 in one night and thousands more in a year. I'm not a sore loser! Sunset has just made me a Loser period!! Most of the people that visit Sunset Station or Any of their properties leave sad and penniless!! I have waited a very long time to write this review...Had I known what I know now...I would have Never patronized Any Station Casino! Once you visit one...There all the same!! I can't say this enough Station Casinos Suck!! They Don't cater to locals...They cater to themselves!! The only good thing in Sunset Stations are the food reviews I've done  ( Please check those out if you like ) I'm also writing this review more to spare others the heartache I've felt...If you go...Play with caution...If you win take it! Don't for one reason think you are going to keep winning! I have seen people win a $1000 and play it down to Zero! ( I feel sad for all the good people that visit Sunset Station and All Station Casinos!! ) If I could Boycott them I would!! But for now I have decided to STOP going to All Station Casinos and All Las Vegas Casinos Period!! They All Suck!! Las Vegas is a fun place If one doesn't gamble...If you are a person that learns from others mistake...This review is for you!! Good Luck in life and God Bless You.( If I could give them a Negative ZERO!! ~ I Would ).*"}
{"text":"A good friend lives in Vegas and decided to take me here when I was visiting.  I was honestly a little annoyed that it was a 20-30 minute drive from my hotel but upon arrival I was happy she made me go!  As far as casino's go there's about a million and one of them in Nevada, right?  There really isn't anything that stands out about this one over others, except that it's not jam packed with people.  We ended up going 2 different times on my short trip.  The point system by using a member card seems to accumulate quickly, we both ate 2 meals there without paying a dime, all points!   I didn't stay here so I don't know what the rooms are like.  If it wasn't so far from the happenings of Fremont or the strip I would check it out though.   I can see why the locals would like this place, we spent several hours here and I'd do it again!"}
{"text":"This is an a-ok off-Strip casino. It's got decent restaurants, a good movie theatre, cheap gaming, etc. It looks a tad rundown, but still manages to pretty and nice enough. There's not much more to say about it. It's a perfectly fine place to spend some time."}
{"text":"I've never stayed at this hotel but the buffet is one of the best I've ever had, in my life, to date. It only took maybe 30 minutes with a full line to get a table for Sunday Brunch, not bad. Servers and bussers are completely on top of everything while staying honestly pleasant and helpful. Please forgive me for forgetting her name but the short Asian lady, who was serving drinks in the early afternoon on 3/11, was my best friend that day. She made my morning better, could read my mind when I needed another handful of Mimosas, and never kept us waiting for her attention. Buffet had everything you would need: I loved the Spanish rice and bacon in particular, my friend could not stop talking about their turkey. 10/10 will be back again once I'm in the area! Highly recommended if you find yourself in Henderson to stay away from the strip-tourists."}
{"text":"i love it here. Came to get dinner, gamble, and watch a movie I will return"}
{"text":"This place is nice. Lots of things to do. But the buffet is atrocious. And the lines are ridiculous on the weekends.  I have a bad back and the disabled line, takes forever.  And there is no where to sit. No accommodations.  I wouldn't eat here if you offered the food for free. Thank you"}
{"text":"Buffet attendant brought out fresh prime rib for me, and it was the most juicy, tender, and generous cut I've had in Vegas yet.  The $15 price was covered by the cut, mashed potatoes, and broccoli alone."}
{"text":"Sunset is a nice local casino off the strip in Vegas. Some good restaurants and a really nice bar in the middle of the casino floor. Look for the large, domes stainglass ceiling."}
{"text":"Buffet a great place to eat reasonably priced and ask for Sharon she is the best server always smiling and cares about your needs."}
{"text":"Great place great people great food! Not busy on weekdays which is nice and there are multiple dining options to choose from.  Great staff at the Cashier area and have never met anybody there that isn't pleasant."}
{"text":"Our family lodged here along with many others for our family reunion this passed weekend and the customer service was great! From check in, to providing more fluffy pillows, blankets and towels they have provided excellent service. Their Grand café was open 24/7, their prices were very affordable and the food was Yummy! The buffet?!  Reasonable prices throughout the day. Breakfast I would say was the best hands down. Also many stores conveniently around us, from Walmart across the street, del taco, In N Out, the mall the opposite way literally down the street. Would I stay here again? Hell yes! Thank you Sunset station for accommodating us along with our hundreds of family Members for the weekend!"}
{"text":"Sam Riddle brings country to Vegas!  We have seen him a couple times over the year and he always delivers a fun show.  I would say he has the charm of Kenny and the action pack show of Garth!  Look him up when you are in Vegas and I promise it will be a great show!"}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet was one of my dad's favorites. Glad he's gone so he couldn't witness the decline. It used to be a great value and good for kids. It is now very scary food with layers of grease on top of the chili, dead string beans in the Asian section and stale desserts in what used be a very magical area of the buffet. Everything seems like it's been reheated for days on end. There is not even fake guacamole in the Mexican section. Don't look for fresh fruit because it's not here! No worries getting too full because you'll be able to resist. Hope they make improvements soon."}
{"text":"Great Hotel! Stayed here since I was visiting a friend who lived in Henderson. THe people were so friendly. Room was huge, bright and clean. The casinos were a bit smokey, but not too overwhelming. Plenty of gaming options, there is a movie theater and a bowling alley in the hotel. And the food is great too. I would certainly choose this as a great off the strip option!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's beautiful,  the staff are always very friendly.  Easy to park. The slots seem looser here.  This is my go to local place . I go downtown to Freemont St. On a regular basis,  but eveytime I come here it turns out to be a great time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the valley to go to watch movies. They have the great recliner seats, solid sound system, and clear screens.   I've also been there for the Feast Buffet which I enjoyed. For all of the people who don't enjoy it at all, perhaps expectations need to be managed. If you're looking for world class, this isn't the one. They did update the Buffet area so it's clean and has a nice vibe. They have a wide variety of choices and the food is all decent.   In any event, my recommendation is that you give it a shot. If you're a local, definitely make this one of your area buffets/theaters."}
{"text":"My guy and I stayed here last Thursday night on our way to the Laughlin River Run.  I was impressed with how clean and fresh smelling it was.  Our room was very nice.  It looked as if it had been recently decorated.  Beautiful tile on the bathroom floors etc.  We had a great meal at the Oyster Bar (already reviewed on Sunday).  My only issue was with the price we paid.  I booked on line.  It said the rooms were $38.  By the time I paid, it was $50.03.  I was expecting this as I am familiar with hotel room tax fees etc.  And our room was certainly worth fifty bucks.  The problem for me arose when we checked in.  I am not familiar with resort fees as I don't normally stay at hotels here in Vegas as I live here.  We were told we had to pay a $15 (plus tax) amenity fee.  Seems to me we should have been told about this fee when we booked our room.  Now I'm not saying the room wasn't worth $65.  It was.  I just felt bilked.  The amenity fee covered local and long distance phone calls (I have my cell phone with me, thank you very much) and in room internet (didn't bring my lap top) and children under 10 can go bowling for $1 (didn't have any kids with me, they won't fit on our Harley) and VIP passes to the Feast Buffet (sorry, I ate at the Oyster Bar) and unlimited use of the fitness center (now I might have brought work out clothes IF I HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THIS IN ADVANCE) and a copy of the Review Journal as long as it wasn't Sunday.  The only thing I used of the mandatory amenity package was the newspaper.  I actually get home delivery of the paper so I knew one would be waiting for me at home but I figured I should at least get something for my $15 plus tax!  But a $15 newspaper?  That's a little steep."}
{"text":"There's a lot of reasons I enjoy coming here:  Local traffic instead of tourist traffic.  If you cash your check here, you have a chance of doubling it, getting points, or other goodies.  I've actually won a free t-shirt.  They always have Buy 1 Get 1 Free coupons for the buffet.  My boo and I get mailers for these all the time.  The buffet prices are much more reasonable than anything on the Strip.  The IMAX theater and Fatburger are also good reasons to swing on by and enjoy a bit of Vegas without the normal Vegas atmosphere.  I do miss the Hooters that used to be here as I'm one of those strange people that enjoys their wings and fries."}
{"text":"The Sunset Station receives NEGATIVE stars.  How is it possible in today's society for a large corporation like the Sunset Station can NOT give a refund on a credit without the person being present? RIDICULOUS.....   Sunset Station over charged my husbands credit card without permission but also charged his friends credit card.  Sunset Station double dipped on their charges and now make it impossible for the monies to be reimbursed.  SCAM....  We will no longer stay at Sunset Station in Las Vegas and we will continue to tell everyone we can what rip-off artists the Sunset Station truly are.  CHEATERS.....  We are in the 21st century - hello, get your act together and refund the  charges on the credit card without the person and card needing to be present. ABSURD   The manager was of NO HELP WHAT SO EVER EITHER. As a matter of fact, she has no business being in a management position. Unprofessional, disrespect, rude, unprincipled, improper are words that define her behavior. DISHONEST......"}
{"text":"Sneaky \"hotel amenity fee\" of 14.95 which I actually think is a good deal, but it's only when you check-in that it's communicated in the room key folder.  Furthermore, asked three times regarding internet and was told it's free.  If you pay for something, it's not free.  So, was charged another 9.99  for additional device.  Questionable business practices, but then again, what would you expect from a casino.  Definitely not returning to sunset.  Texas station was my long time favorite, but if they play the same game, not taking my business to any station casinos."}
{"text":"VERY VERY Disappointing DON'T BOOK WITH THEM !!! We were on our honeymoon road trip and decided to stop in Vegas for a couple of days... After receiving a recommendation from a family member we decided to stay here at Sunset. I went online after speaking to the reservation department to confirm openings for the KING rooms and booked a KING size room as I have back issues and need a larger bed. When we showed up they had overbooked the KING rooms and offered us a double queen room as a replacement. When we said that we would just go somewhere else they refused to give us our deposit back saying that it fell under the rule for minimum cancellation time. I asked for an upgrade to a KING suite because of their mistake... NOPE NOT A CHANCE. They even had the audacity to try to convince me that the double queen room was a better option. Not only did they deny us the room we had RESERVED they FORCED us to take a room we would be uncomfortable in or forfeit the $$ we had placed as a deposit. My newlywed husband and I spent our stay here in SEPARATE beds because they overbooked."}

{"text":"The stay was nice king Room good upgrade.  Little room issues finish work  bathroom. You would think housekeeper would notify maintenance. Games where mostly good. Slots where good. Tables were nice. There was one problem.   Night 2  The first dealer for Roulette I believe his name was Nick was really good and then came the switch...! Always when you're winning   I don't mind when the casino takes my money but show the respect to the game I don't want to hear about your weekend also it was in a different language. Playing with the chips Not paying attention to the table the balls was spinning Waved no more bets late I could've threw out more bets. Not paying attention to the game.   Keep in mind the table is full And spending money I was $400 -$500 at the time. I got up and cashed out talk to the other players took one more spin Then I went to talk to the pit boss told him why I was leaving the table he did not look happy. Five minutes later Meet Three of the other players at the cashier cashing And they felt the same way.    About 20 minutes later I took a stroll back by the tables set down across a different table alone I really wish I remembered the dealers name I hate to say this but the bald guy...lol he was the best he new the game loved to talk Ask if I need a drink where was I from I gave him good tips when I hit...I love that kind of customer service. Friendly   But overall a good four days"}

{"text":"Soo, I met the bf's parents we went to Vegas and this was our first stop! After the parents picked us up, they drove us to this hotel. I really liked this place because it's newly renovated, clean, and cheap! They had a lot of slot machines that were the nickel machines and they were loose, too, compare to the fancier hotels at the strip. I noticed the tables had low minimums, too!  Although this hotel is away from the strip, it wasn't a bad drive if you want to stay here over night. Stay away from the buffet, though.. it wasn't that good! Get their Preferred Card, you get points and win some cool prizes! I didn't get to stay for the drawing, though."}
{"text":"We usually come here for the Pan Roast when the line at Palace Station is too long. The seafood is not that fresh, portions are less, not as creamy as the original & seasoning is slightly different but when you're starving & craving for Pan Roast, this place will pass. Price are $1-2 cheaper than PS but got also get smaller portions as well."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I have stayed at this hotel and I had decided to plan a re-visit as i heard they did a remodel of their rooms.  CHECK IN:- The service at check in wasn't amazing, but wasn't poor so I can say we point the needle somewhere in the \"blah\" range.  ROOM: The newly remodeled rooms looked so classy.....the bright cream colors that once adorned this room have been replaced with stately and regal looking dark browns and white. The furnishings were brand new along with the carpeting. The only remembrance of the former Sunset Station rooms is the bathroom/shower area which seemingly were untouched during the renovation ( i dont think it needed to be touched anyway).....Even the hotel corridors were given much needed TLC!  POOL: The pool here is very large, a great comfortable temperature, and appears to be plenty of seating .....No hot tub exists though (sad face).  Check out one of their numerous bars also, the whole casino has a unique atmosphere.  I had the breakfast buffet in the morning which was pretty solid for the price.  There's no reason that you shouldn't book here if you want to stay on this side of town,"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel. I had never stayed there before and usually choose either the Strip or the Freemont area depending on what biz I may have to conduct in the surrounding areas.   This time I was judging the Sam's Club National BBQ Tour at a Sam's Club local to this hotel. It was about 7 miles away.   Actually really liked the room. It was clean, decorated really nicely and had a great view of the \"other side\" of Vegas and the beautiful mountains.   Being disabled while my new knee heals, I had to have security take me in a wheelchair provided by the hotel to my room. They lost a star because they don't rent motorized scooters here, you have to call a company they give you and they will deliver one. And also, the rooms are quite far from the casino...too long of a walk for me right now. But they were always pleasant to deal with...the staff and the company you rent the scooter from.   I won $150 on the penny slots there and that was fun! I was able to take my friends out to dinner at one of the hotel's restaus on the house. And what a great restau! The Oyster Bar. Got great reviews on here and it didn't disappoint at all. Separate review for that.   For a deal on this hotel, I would suggest going onto their own web site and look for a Supersaver deal. I had been on Orbitz and others but the hotel itself gave me the best deal. $93 on Fri night and $102 on Sat.   They seem to have great concerts here too. Would love to come back to see Joan Jett, Berlin, John Waite and The Romantics coming up in June.   i would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Got to stay here during a bike event, the room was clean & had no smoke smell at all, which was a miracle since the lobby smelled pretty strong.. Everyone was really nice & we called downstairs for more towels & they were brought up to us very quickly!  The room wasn't fancy, but it wasn't bad! The bed was comfortable & everything worked. The only thing that sucked was that the shower curtain liner was non existent, and if you stayed in the shower for too long, the floor would be soaking wet!!   The bowling alley was pretty awesome & it was fun playing a couple games there! The restaurants were good, except the main Cafe.. Steer clear! Starbucks, Sonoma Cellar, Fatburger, the Mexican place, all good!"}
{"text":"We were on a road trip to Tahoe and stopped over in Henderson for the night. I've stayed there before a few years ago and like the hotel accommodations and buffet so we decided to go back. We arrived and had two rooms booked for the night. This time we had a small dog with us (and she is well behaved and house broken) and unfortunately we were denied to our rooms because no pets were allowed. It was my fault for not noticing in the booking that pets were not allowed. My issue is with the desk check in staff you were rather cold about the whole situation. Staff was very unhelpful.They gave me a choice to pay an additional $250 for each room (total $500) to stay with our pet dog. We declined and figured we could find a hotel that was pet friendly, and save our money. I was told I would be credited back our money since there was a misunderstanding on the pet policy. I checked my credit card and they charged me anyway so now I have to dispute the charges because the hotel is saying I was a no show. What an inconvenience this is to try to get money back. Not happy with the place. On the positive side, Sunset Station does have a good buffet that's not too expensive."}
{"text":"The other night, I was here for quite some time and spent a considerable amount of money. No winning and servers were forgetting orders. It was a really bad night but I had already invested that money. The only thing I asked was to have a pack of cigarettes comped. I was told I hadn't spent enough that night! Wait...what? For cigarettes? I could've put a down payment on a liquor store and sell cigarettes all day for the amount of money I put in. They must be kidding. I've never asked for cigarettes, ever. But, I see hosts handing them out all the time.   Tonight, I visited. It was notably slower then the other night. I did not see even one server to mess up my order. I moved areas and it was no better. So, I decided to leave. Clearly my time or money is not valued here. On the way out, I saw a slot supervisor. I mentioned how there doesn't seem to be any additional benefits to being loyal to stations. I could win and lose just the same at any other casino. Why should I continue playing here? He told me to, \"F*** off\". I wonder, is this ok with management? His name is Manny. He has one eye. Tall, skinny, grey beard, and thick Latin accent. How do these people get a job? Lemme guess...family?"}
{"text":"I love this local casino and I'm not sure why. The layout is confusing at first but once u find yourself the landmarks spots it's easy to navigate. I've stayed in the rooms before when y parents would visit, nothing posh but I do appreciate a clean room and decent size.   What I also like about this place is the upgraded movie theatre, hooters, and I absolutely love the bowling arena. I played $3.75 bowling but I do know they have $1.50 bowling as well . Cosmic bowling was super fun plus if u have kids playing with you you can set up the bumpers to go up when it's their turn to bowl! Super neat!!! California bowling is so expensive so I appreciate this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here in and off since they opened. The only place in my 30 trips to Vegas that I've ever really won some money. A nice selection of games and slots available. The dealers are nice and helpful. If you join the players club you receive great offers on rooms....sometimes the rooms are free! A little bit of a drive from the strip but a great place to gamble and possibly win something."}
{"text":"Good buffet for $9.99. No frills like lobster medallions and sushi, but I give it a thumbs up"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the most affordable and delicious buffets in Vegas! Can't wait to come back! Thank you for two awesome breakfasts!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely surprised when I walked into my room here! The rooms are actually pretty nice. I had been coming here for years as a local when I lived in Vegas but never needed to book a room before.  Comfortable beds, updated decor, easy check-in with friendly staff, cheap rates. Definitely a place you should consider staying at on your next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I can only review my Player card and breakfast buffet experience. We aren't big gamblers but we do like to play with accumulated change on penny slots. :-)  I'm pretty stingy with my 5 stars but I gave Sunset Station 5 stars because of their customer service at the player reward center and the variety in the buffet.   When we DO go to a casino, we have learned to get a player card because sometimes you can get some discounts on food or free play. So, when we got to Sunset Station, we looked for the player center. While standing in the line, Mark approached us and asked if he could help us with signing up. It took only a few minutes and Mark explained to us the benefits of the card, took us to the kiosk and showed us how to log in, told us about the app. We had been given a complete personal orientation!   The buffet was excellent, the food looked fresh and not like it had been sitting in the hot table for hours. I'm not a breakfast eater but the variety is great allowing me to have whatever else I wanted that wasn't eggs and bacon.   Hope you have that kind of experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed 3 night at this hotel. We got a pretty good deal $30 per night. Our room was great. Big and clean. We ate at the Fiesta buffet, good price also and many choices of food. The hotel wasn't super crowded like most Vegas hotels are so we enjoyed that. I'd stay there again!!"}
{"text":"Can't complain, $4.99 for a breakfast buffet. I feel like I'm back in the 80's, yes I'm that old. I remember breakfast buffets that cheap. Food was mediocre, c'mon it's a buffet, what do you expect. I'm not a buffet person, but  for $5 why not. Good thing is that a mimosa was only $3, score"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean.  It would be a great place to bring a family. It's nice being outside of Vegas and close to Lake Mead.  We had the best breakfast and coffee at the Sunset Grill. We had all of our meals there and everything was great.  We also had great luck with the slots. My husband did great our first night and I did great our last night.  The negatives: Good luck getting help with your luggage The parking is out in the open, hopefully patrolled The walk from the casino to the room elevators is the longest I've ever seen No coffee station in the rooms No safety rail in the showers I never could connect with the free wi fi"}

{"text":"We stayed here a couple days ago because rooms on the strip were overpriced so we figured we stay in Henderson and drive to the strip if we wanted to. Our room was for 4 people, 2 nights, two queen beds we paid around $260 ish. The room were nice. Shower area was small. We rented a cabana for the day and it was nice. Tbh it's pricey with gratuity fee it came up to $95 and with 5 waters and fruit Platter. The strawberries were rotten and the girl server didn't do anything about it, she just shrugged it off like she didn't care. I mean for $95 you would think they would at least try to replace them or offer more of another fruit. But other than that the pool was fun.. not very deep. (Side note the cabana did not come with sunscreen like I was told it would) Anyway, pizza inside casino was bomb. Also the turkey club sandwich!  omg I miss it !!  The buffet was really affordable and pretty good.. The Asian side taste just like panda express.. overall I would stay here again.  Oh before I forget. Bring snacks like chips and candy because they don't have inside vending machines. And the gift shop closes early af."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I came here last week with a softball team. We arrived early and they wouldn't allow us to check in till 3pm which is the rules but it wasn't like the hotel was busy. When they did check us in they wouldn't put us on the same floor with the team which was supposed to happen since we booked this well in advance.   The first room they put us in had dried blood on the couch and a dirty bathroom. They tried to hide the blood by placing the cushions over it. We then had to repack and move everything up two more floors with no comp anything. Upon arrival to the new room the bathroom was dirty and we had to clean it.   They would only provide two new towels a day for a family of four. It took three days to half clean up throw up near the ice machine.   There were people smoking in the hallways and leaving the cigarette butts on the floor. Manager did nothing to resolve our issues.   Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"My daughter, best friend and myself stayed here, while we were visiting Las Vegas. This was honestly such a perfect place for us to stay with my little one. With having a one year old, the strip is was too chaotic for me. With this station casino, we were able to enjoy all the luxuries of a bigger resort but in a much smaller package. The employees were all helpful on getting us checked in and showing us where to go. The resort, itself, has a lot to offer: numerous restaurants, a buffet, arcades, day care, bowling, and so much more. We took advantage of the buffet and although most of the food was mediocre, it was still enjoyable. There was something for everyone and it made catching lunch, on a break away from the pool, that much easier. The pool was undoubtedly my favorite spot! It was gorgeous. The perfect spot to kickback and have some fun for the day, especially since their is a poolside bar, serving up delicious margaritas. My daughter loved the pool. The shallow end was just perfect for her, since it starts off at only a few inches, it made it ideal for her to be able to explore. Our room was nice! Nothing over the top, but the beds were comfy, the room was clean and the AC worked well! It had all we needed, except maybe a mini fridge. I would definitely stay here or at one of the other station casinos again!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to win some pocket change. Get some snacks and even get a cool room to stay over night. I love the slots! And the poker room :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I bought a condo in Henderson, a year ago. We stopped at the sunset station casino for a bite to eat at the Italian restaurant   The food was good. My Tuscan steak was excellent. We signed up for a players card and we were invited to one of the best concerts we had ever heard. It was last June. It was the Romantics, good, Berlin, excellent and Joan Jett and the black hearts, absolutely incredible. The seats were excellent. This casino sure knew how to make us feel welcome. I hope the invitations keep coming. Bravo!!!  They have several restaurants including a Buffett.  We found the service to be friendly,helpful and courteous. There is ample parking around the casino with a great many disabled parking spaces. There are also several cocktail bars with many drink specials."}

{"text":"We were sitting in the nickel machines and hadn't seen a cocktail waitress for at least an hour. Denise came over to check on us because she saw us looking for anyone to bring us a water. She was in the high limit slots. I'd guess it wasn't her area, but she came over to see if we were ok.  I was so appreciative that she did it. She was so polite and caring. She even told us if we needed anything else to let her know. Being in the hospitality industry, going outside of her area was completely unexpected! Because of Denise, I will gladly return and will be more likely to bring my gaming business here.  I'd like to thank her for the awesome service she provided and her kindness was beyond any experience I've had here."}
{"text":"(My fiancee and I stayed here 3 1/2 weeks ago. I'm just going to be brief and go over the pros and cons of the place because it was nice, but not \"great\"; we'll probably stay here again if we can't find a better option-)  Cons:  1.The Weather:   Be warned! Vegas is a *desert*: We went in May thinking it's be cool-ish and mild-ish: It wasn't!! It was very muggy (It rained) and very, very windy-felt like the inside of a hairdryer every time we went outside; the hot, high winds (Gusts up to 60+ mph) made \"walking the strip\" very unenjoyable. Our bad and we'll more than likely not go there between the months of May-August next time, but still; I hate being cramped up inside! :/  2. Our Trip (Cut Short due to the Weather): 2 stars off  My fiancee and I were booked here for 4 days but ended up leaving a day early due to inclement weather. I know it's not fair of me to take a couple of stars off, but we had really been looking forward to relaxing poolside and getting a cabana each day, only to find the pool open only 1 day out of what would've been 4: Blah. :/  3. The Weird WIFI and \"Fine Print Resort Fee\" Charges: 1 star off  Additionally, they have this Game that they play where they \"say\" you get \"Free WIFI\" in your Room but you're charged the fee for it and it's \"taken\" out of your Resort Fee at the end...something like a charge-back it was explained to us..Yeah, okay, sure sounds shady...BUT I want to clearly state that after looking over our statement after our Trip, we were charged-back the WIFI fees..but we had this nagging, in-the-background-uncomfortable, \"will they charge it back or not\" feeling, which put a small damper on our enjoyment. I also think that they should've been way, way more \"upfront\" about the Resort Fee vs. making it a \"fine print\" item that you kind've..discover upon checking in. :/  Pros:  1. The Oyster Bar: Pretty decent, I've had better, but not bad for Vegas.  2. No nasty smoke smell  3. Clean, quite rooms (Albeit slightly worn down)  All in all, my fiancee adores this Casino and wants to stay here again. Me, not so much; there's plenty of other places to stay that I'd like to check out..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, used to be a great local spot for Henderson folks. Don't know what changed in last couple years"}
{"text":"The buffet at this casino is pretty damn good!   As for the slot machines and poker machines, they are so tight I think they squeak when I walk by!   My aunt and uncle are Million Point members and have way too many points that they can ever think of using so we always end up eating here when visiting the family in town.   The food is always hot and in constant rotation. I have yet to meet a dry piece of chicken. Their salad bar is really fresh and clean. I like the dessert bar the best as it has Caramel Creme Ice Cream. The hubby got a scoop and I almost had to knock him out to get another bite. It was that good! I really like that they have an \"international\" flair to theif buffet because then it doesn't get boring.  I am sure that I wil be back for a buffet next time I am in town as my aunt and uncle will not eat anywhere else."}

{"text":"The box spring was sagging so bad we felt like we were going to roll off the bed. The mattress Springs we're also popping and crackling in the area of the broken box spring that it was impossible to get a good night sleep. We contacted the front desk the next morning and they sent up a replacement, but it was broken across the bottom spine and along the edges just as bad as the original one. What the heck? The second night of our stay, we were awoken at 1:30 a.m. by housekeeping that was preparing the room next to us. Seriously, 1:30 am? The housekeeping employee was talking Extremely Loud on her walky-talky in the hallway and then proceeded to bang on the walls and make a tremendous amount of noise while cleaning the room. I had gone out in the hallway to speak with the employee and asked if she could be quieter and was told that she was doing the best she could and that this is a like a hospital, we work 24/7.  I couldn't believe the response and it was in a rude tone as if how dare I confront her regarding waking us up at 1:30 in the morning. I called the front desk to complain and felt as if they could care less. Management did provide us with a $30 meal credit for the inconvenience regarding the mattress box spring. And the front desk employee that checked us out credited our account $22 which worked out to be 1 days Resort fees that they add on to your hotel room cost. $52 is hardly adequate compensation for two nights of inconvenience."}
{"text":"This is not a 5 star hotel luxury wise. I am giving it 5 stars for what you get for the price. Sunset is clean, fun, and has excellent prices. From bowling alleys to a movie theatre to slots, you can't go wrong staying here!  UPDATE: In November of 2015, we had some difficult issues regarding some of the staff. We were so upset about it, I called downstairs to speak with a manager. Within a few minutes, I was transferred to James Ouano (hotel manager), and I felt he did so much to correct the situation. I am very grateful he not only resolved the issue, but even went out of his way, to type a card to us, apologizing on behalf of some staff's behavior. I understand not every company is perfect, but good managers are truly an asset when these issues arise. Thanks James!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my stat in the hotel. Pool was nice, casino staff was nice and fun. Buffet was pretty good and the two free drinks at the main bar were a perk. The amenity fee is absurd and that's why it only gets four stars."}
{"text":"Buffet only review.   Horrible food.  Really dreadful.  It gets 2 stars because the place was acceptably clean, and it was cheap.  The casino is similar to other Station casinos around town, but parking and way finding here is not quite as good as Fiesta or Texas Stations, which are similarly suburban locations."}
{"text":"Typical vegas locals casino but IMO slightly better than most of the others. I use to go to Boulder Station but Sunset is maybe 2 notches above it.."}
{"text":"The Station Casinos are some of my favorite in Vegas.  Yes, none of them are on the strip or in downtown.  They are all off strip. Most of them have $5 tables even on the weekends and most have a ton of penny slots.  So if you want a cheaper gambling experience then go to one of the Station Casino.  Sunset is obviously one of them.  It's a good way from the strip but it has some reasons worthy of the visit.  First the cheap tables.  But they also have lazy boy type recliners at it's Regal Theater and it has the Oyster Bar, a must eat while in Vegas.  See my review on that restaurant. It is one of the older Station casino, but it's clean and the staff is friendly. You won't regret making the trek here."}
{"text":"The Cafe in Sunset is easily the best of the Henderson area. The shrimp cocktail inside is a must. The Mexican restaurant is great as well with the massive salsa bar. I've never had any problems with the casino."}
{"text":"I stayed here because of business and really had no choice in the matter. The room were big but there are no microwaves, you have to order a fridge, and no coffee makers. The water took forever to get hot, the place is old, and on the third day of swimming in the pool I swam through a hair ball that covered me. I didn't swim after that. The Starbucks down stairs had nice customer service and the grand cafe was good too. Everything else sucked. I say steer away from here and find another place to stay."}
{"text":"Worst place ever please read.  I would like to say that I never do review but in this case I must. It first started off with me reserving a room for two nights. I get to the counter and they give me my key and everything was great until I walk in on a family at 1 am.  I go back down there and tell them a family is living in there and the guy says I'm so sorry wow here's a bigger room for your inconvenience. I said it's not a problem and went on my way. Then the next day I go to my room mid day and my key doesn't work so I go down there and tell them and the lady said you only paid for one night and I told her I specifically told the man yesterday I will be staying for two. So she them says ok well you will have to pay again. Instead of being 127 dollars for what I originally was suppose to pay a night she said with the upgraded room you're staying in it will be 167 and I said wait I was upgraded at no cost to me I thought and she then asked me very sarcastically \"so you plan on staying in a bigger room for the same price?\" Even after I told her what happens the night before. I then said ok whatever just put me into a smaller room then and I will move all my stuff she ended up saying I will let you stay in that room but the cost after taxes and all will be 156 something so I just went along and paid it and wouldn't be so mad if it was just a mistake or whatever, but she was the manager and didn't seem to even want to help in any way.... I then go to my room and my key doesn't work again... I go all the way back down and she laughed and said oh Oops I'm sorry.  I will never go there again. Also very sketchy considering 127 for the first night was after taxes and everything. Not to mention this happened almost a week ago and I still have not yet gotten my 100 deposit back yet."}
{"text":"It was close to Sam Boyd stadium so staying here was convenient when we were attending the Monster Jam Finals.  However the hotel has several fatal flaws in my opinion: 1) There is no fridge in the room - we had an upgraded room with 2 Queen beds and still no fridge 2) There is no safe in the room - most hotels have a little safe in the closet you can quickly put your ipads, wallets, or iphones when you are out and don't want the maid or anyone else having any temptation.   3) We have a family of 4 and they only give you 2 bath towels a day - so I had to call down to the front desk every day and have more towels brought up.    We tried to get to the buffet that everyone here talks about but the line is always extremely long and just does not move.  We waited an hour and moved up 5 feet so we left.  Tried it again the next day and the line was even longer and not moving.  The price is cheap for it so it attracts everyone looking to save a few dollars like us - but spending hours in line to eat is not my idea of fun.  So we ate elsewhere."}

{"text":"Review for Casino Area Only Not Hotel  Riding an UBER to this location cost $39 uber xl I really don't know how we ended up here because this was about 25 minutes or 11 miles away from the strip.  My only guess is that we needed a quiet place away from the craziness and needed a hometown feeling, this provided very well.  I expected this place to be tiny since everyone said it was a local casino.  I was wrong. This place was huge.  Once walking in, I felt a very nice Vibe.  A Live Band was playing some cool songs and the place just gave me a relaxed feeling which I needed.  The locals who I have met were wonderful.  The servers, the bartenders, the performers were very inviting. In a matter of minutes, I too felt like a local since they treated me as such.    There were relaxing seats all over the bar where I just plopped on down, listening to the music being played, people watching, having a nice beer or two or three or four, and just had my groove on.  People introduced themselves and we gave high fives to one another while saying cheers and long life as our beer bottles clanked as we toasted the night away.  I am very happy that I found this place.  I definitely look forward to coming back here and probably will stay at this hotel.  This place was refreshing.  After a hard days work, I can imagine sitting and drinking a few cold ones here and literally enjoying it. Thank You Sunset. We will be Back."}
{"text":"Nice local casino. Good restaurants good promotions. The oyster bar is always out of oysters."}
{"text":"Went here with some buddies last night and it was a good night.  They have a lot of tables and a lot of great places to eat also.  The entire night was fun because we didn't have to leave the casino to do anything.  The dealers are friendly and the other staff seem pretty nice too.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have family in Henderson so when we visit we stay at hotels near the green valley area. Our nephew was born last week so I looked up hotels in the area and the price for a room at sunset station was impossible to pass up. We don't gamble, so we don't usually stay at casinos but 40 bucks for a room is insane, we've paid 2-3x that for crappy motels in Southern California in the past few months.   Lots of parking, check in was a breeze. Room was as described, plenty of space, nice and clean. Super quiet all 3 nights. Unreal for 40 bucks a night.   We are both gym rats and usually use the golds since we are members at home, but there's no golds in Vegas any more so we gave the hotel exercise room a try. Not a lot of heavy weights but it got the job done and was well maintained and clean. Pool was huge and fun - water starts super shallow so our two year old loved it.   My only gripe, and I know it's stupid to have a complaint about a 40 dollar room, but we like it cold especially when we sleep. The first thing I did was turn the AC to 60 but we kept waking up pouring sweat in a warm room.   Bottom line is that even if the price goes up 30% we will still stay here the next time we are in Henderson."}
{"text":"I want to really like you but.. Sunset was the first casino I encountered while visiting fam for my 21st bday. I really dug how it was laid out and seemed more friendly for the folks who aren't highrollers. As a casino and hotel it is quite nice and pretty much a one stop shop for your entertainment needs.  I have been to their buffet which was good, their Italian restaurant which I love! the movie theater and the bowling alley. My family members have stayed at the hotel and have enjoyed it. My big gripe which I can't let go because every so often I have run ins with them is the security. They need to restaff ASAP,because the gestapo guards are a thorn in the side of anyone who has the misfortune  to cross paths with them.  Such as run in #1 I have asthma one night after a good game of bowling with a friend I start to really have trouble breathing after walking through a portion of the casino, I go upstairs to the parking garage to get some fresh air to calm down i'm sitting literally a foot away from my truck and deputy doofus rolls up on his bike shouts you can't be here to which i reply i can't breathe having an asthma attack. He counters with while I don't care you have to move or else.. rolls away on his mountain bike cruiser while saying you better not be here when i get back. I don't know why there is a reason for such crappy behavior on his part I wasn't doing anything wrong not even smoking. I'm a pretty wide bodied fella so if he wanted to remove me goodluck picking up my dead weight.   Run in #2 Me and a buddy just finished some cosmic bowling and we wanted to hit the air hockey table to end the night. Upon putting are money in we received no puck so we kindly asked the kid working the counter for help. He wasn't much of a problem solver and asked,\"what do you want me to do\"? I told him either get the puck or give us our money back he said he couldn't give us a refund so .. went with option A. The puck was stuck by something preventing it from dropping, i told him grab a screwdriver to open the area where it was stuck. He comes back 5 mins later and hands me the screwdriver and told me he didn't know how and to get it out myself. I was kinda fedup with his nonsense but I wasn't going to let 2 screws and a moron ruin my air hockey time so undid the screws cleared the obstruction game on! Shortly after we began the grouchy old bowling security guard comes up to us and says are you guys vandalizing our equipment? To which i pointed to pizza face who was slinking away and said no we had to do maintenance because he doesn't know how to use a screwdriver.   The way in which each security guard approaches a guest is not professional at all. I understand being a little gruff if you are dealing with a drunk or someone ruining the good times of everyone else. However to be condescended to by a paying guest is not to be tolerated. I have only been pestered at this place so time for regime change or better training. With the strip losing it's draw more and more you would think the off the strip places would up their game to heard new customers in."}
{"text":"took the offer stayed there tues. HORRIBLE ! first the pool waitress decided to help her self with extra tip out of my change , whatever. next , apparently they are  in the public pool bizz now. allowing non guest to pay ten dollars and bring their section 8 brood of kids to pollute the scene. bad move ! next the buffet was UNEATABLE  worst buffet i've been to in ten yrz .  i mean it was terrible . low quality frozen microwaved crap , prison food .the final straw and capper was got up to take advantage of the breakfast specials 5.30 am and the coffee shop was closed . went to my room packed and took my bizz out of there . this is a nice looking joint but as true to stations reputation the place sucks. they don't love locals,  just their bottom line.  NEVER AGAIN !    they can keep their chezzy crappy offers and bait and switch operation . DO YOURSELF A FAVOR STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE !"}
{"text":"I just don't understand why they have bitchy floor lady like Leslie in the pit. She's the worst lady in the world to be put in the front line for dealing with players.  She's loud, obnoxious and extremely rude to players.  Dealers and players complain constantly about her but yet it fall on deaf ears. Why is it that? Is she paying kickbacks to someone in management just to keep her job?  Is it worth losing customers for her?  She's screamed at me before and screamed at customer when it's her fault. She appeared to have dementia and ADHD because she always has to have the last say, clearly not the right position for her. Perhaps a toilet cleaning job.    Someone above her boss should really look deep into the complaints she's had at such a short employment period.  Up until her sorry ass is fired, I will not step foot in here. If   You've experienced the same with this lady, click like on post."}
{"text":"I was most disappointed with the front desk personnel. The first person to help us was not friendly. She told us our room would not be ready for an hour so we walked around and waited. After a little over an hour we went back to the front desk. The same person then told us our room wouldn't be ready for another 1-2 hours. I asked if she could confirm that because it was my wedding night and I would rather come back later than wait around. She got annoyed and picked up the phone to call someone who told her an hour. I asked to speak to a manager and she told me no one was available. I walked to the casino area and asked how I could get ahold of a manager and a casino host told me he would call the manager and have her call me. When the manager called she said, \"I understand you have some concerns.\" I said yes, I am concerned that we've waited over two hours for our room so far, but I am more upset that the front desk clerk was very rude to us. I'm getting married tonight and looking forward to checking in. The manager said, \"Well your room is ready. We can't guarantee your room will be ready when you arrive.\" I told her I understood that but was disappointed at the front desk clerk because she was quite rude. Her response was, \"We can't guarantee your room will be ready when you arrive, but it's ready now.   Between the front desk clerk and manager, neither had any customer service skills. The suite was decent looking, but overall I'm sorry I chose to stay at Sunset Station due to the poor customer service I received on such an important day in my life. As a local I'm aware of many other options and will chose more wisely in the future."}
{"text":"This room 1702 wasn't clean. The toilet handle had feces around the toilet knob(handle) . The floor look like it wasn't vacuumed . It took them almost an hour to bring towels to the room ."}
{"text":"Super-convenient to Henderson, clean rooms, comfy beds, not noisy, friendly staff, lots of entertainment (72 lane bowling alley, movie theater, fat burger, Panda Express), you'd never need to leave here!"}
{"text":"Stayed here twice in the past month, the host assigned to me by the casino Jasmin Gusman is awesome. I got a reservation for end of April which they upgraded my room to a huge room free of charge. And on Memorial day weekend I came in late and they canceled my reservation but they made arrangements and I got the room. Love the hotel its quite and peaceful close to the Hoover Damn and if you traveling great location as a stop."}
{"text":"I always thought that Sunset Station was \"ghetto\" for lack of better terms but boy was I in for a treat! I hadn't even known that there was a bowling alley let along a movie theater!  Since moving close by, we had to venture. We ventured into what I thought was a run down casino....they have a HUGE bowling alley (I think the biggest in the valley) complete with cosmic bowling and discounted bowling I think before noon M-F it's $1 per game (check website to be sure.)  Anyway, we spontaneously went and watched \"Central Intelligence\" and the ticketing agent weirdly asked me what seat I wanted to be assigned to. I picked a seat for both of us and walked away thinking that was quite odd.  We walked into the movie theaters and instantly figured out why we had assigned seating. It was reclining seats!!!! And huge ones might I add! So awesome! It made the movie much more comfortable to watch!"}
{"text":"Stayed here while visiting family in nearby Henderson. It's a fun area, because the rates are lower than in Las Vegas and you're still very close. It's a great launching pad for Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, ATVs in the desert, & even Grand Canyon tours.  The hotel was pretty nice, here's my list of pros and cons:  PROS:  -Good looking hotel, in and out. Well maintained. -Fun rewards system in the casino. -Several food options, plus lots of games and a nice pool for kids too.  NEUTRALS:  -Room was large but also very sparse, with nothing in the way of amenities. Was pretty clean though and did not smell. -Compared to Vegas proper, not an overly exciting place. But compared to somewhere like South Lake Tahoe, it's a fancy place. Context is really something huh?! -No shuttle to the strip like Stations more expensive and nearby sister property. -Pool is restricted to guests only, forcing residents and others (family for example) to pay. -Security desk outside the room elevator and pool. Serves to make you to feel both safer and also worry about the crime they've experienced to require such measures.  CONS:  -Very smokey casino. Definitely not fun for a non-smoker...not the worst you've been in...but could definitely use some improvement. -Hotel over-billed my room versus their own online confirmation. Had to call and email with them to have it sorted out. Ultimately they were able to credit me the deserved amount, but they did force me to send them PDF confirmations and make a case...which is unfortunate given their own system disparity. -Check-in took a very long time, with only one person at the front who seemed new and slow at their job, even though there were only about 3 of us in line at around 10pm.  Although I would stay here again, I would highly consider spending just a little more to check out their sister property (Green Valley Ranch). Sunset station is for large families and those needing lots of rooms and on a budget. But for a cleaner (less smokey) and more humanizing experience, something better is needed."}
{"text":"Its a great place for the family. I come here all of the time because of the kids club.  I can drop the kids off and catch a movie and then grab dinner as a family. Gambling here is ok.  Never been to the pool or stayed in the rooms.  But as a local hang out. I like it a lot."}
{"text":"Talk about a huge surprise!  We're in the process of moving to Henderson so we've had to make it out to vegas twice already, both times I booked on the strip, but this last time, I decided to book at this hotel because its literally a block away from where our house is going to be. I was completely impressed from the moment I walked in. It's a whole lot nicer than you would expect. It has so many different amenities for everyone to enjoy. The rooms are well maintained and spacious. The bathroom and sink area were very clean. Only thing I found odd was that there were only 2 towles on the rack and no small trash can in the bathroom. Anywho, there is security right before you get on the elevators, which I personally liked. There is also a movie theater, a bowling ally, and an aracde for the kids. It also has several different dinning options.   I would recommend this place to anyone who is wanting a nice little weekend getaway, it still gives you the vegas vibe, with the gambling, drinks, and nightlife atmosphere but not that insane drunken crowd you would get on the strip.  Great for families as well."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to check the rooms out here yet, but everything else is awesome!  Huge, winding casino with great payouts.  The on-site Hooters restaurant is excellent, easy on the eyes, and seems to be a step above the mainstreams.  The bowling center is huge, is open 24 hours a day, and has some great specials running after midnight.  The location is great - directly across from a huge mall and shopping center, with lots of restaurants and big-box stores in the mix.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We stay at sunset station hotel, the hotel is very clean, the room is clean, but their is no safe box in the room, and when we went to the pool they didn't have enough chairs. All the chairs were taken. Unfortunately I will not stay here again.(first time and last)."}
{"text":"This is my old stomping ground...The bowling Alley is amazing, I think it's 72 lanes...the buffet was renovated and looks better, the food is like any other buffet.  The movie theater is a convenient place to go, they have iMax but not TRUE iMax. The table games are nicely placed in the center of the casino and have nice local limits. The dealers are real nice and friendly.  Kids Quest helps parents babysit their kids if they want to gamble."}
{"text":"BEWARE of the hidden amenity fee. At first look, the rooms seem so cheap, but then also add onto that price an addiitonal $16 for an amenity fee that they automatically charge you even if you don't want to use their internet.   That's the only reason why Sunset Station gets 4 stars. Other than that, the rooms are very clean, new looking, and nice. The casino tables have low minimums which is nice.  Also, the hotel is huge! It has a movie theater, starbucks, and tons of restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a quieter place to stay away from the strip"}
{"text":"This place has become ridiculous !!!   Still have cold water in the bathrooms, slot areas a dirtier than hell and rarely cleaned up, the food prices have increased twice in the last year and the food quality is worse  i.e  over cooked and dried out fried chicken, over salted fish, wilted lettuce and a messy salad bar, worn carpets, very tight machines that barely pay more than they absolutely have to and constantly tease at the exact same time every time.   When are these owners going to wake up.........Not everyone is oblivious to what is actually going on."}
{"text":"Well Sunset Station, i haven't been in your place, or any of the Station Casinos since my very piss poor experience was never resolved.  I did get an e-mail saying my points are going to expire.  I also received a letter from Dawn Rawle, Senior Vice President of Marketing & Advertising.  Well Dawn, I may come in and get free stuff with my points before the end of the month, but I will not spend money in your businesses.  I tell everyone at the other Casinos I go to about the very very BAD experience at the Grand Cafe at Sunset Station.  They need to take a lessen from Snap's.  Please, read my review of them.  I eat and play at other local casinos, and enjoy myself way more than I have at Stations casinos. Not even really an effort was taken to rectify what we went through that night. I Do Not want contacted by John Beagle again. He don't give a shit about people or his job.  If so, he would of put forth a much better effort to contact me and discuss what happened.  I did receive the pull tabs for July. I scratched them out of curiosity, and the biggest things on them was a 3000 point win, and 3 dollar free play.  That's because I don't spend money there.  You can't tell me different.  Sorry, don't believe you have a chance unless you spend money at your casinos.  In the past six months, I have spent thousands at other casinos, and have won thousands in return.  They have way better comp programs, and I miss you Not.  Beware to all, they just want your money. Enough Said!"}
{"text":"Allllllll Aboard!!!! Takin the Train to.... Sunset Station?! No, not a train station, even better, An absolutely beautiful casino! Yes Sunset Station in Henderson NV. All I can say is wow, This place absolutely blew me away. Henderson NV is Vegas, much smaller and toned down. All the glitz and glamor of the strip with the performers, city night time views, gambling, that's all good. But when you want to have Vegas, and not all that, this should definitely be your first stop. Upon walking in it's just massive. It looks big from the street, but when inside, it's huge, and gorgeous. They have many restaurants, massive gaming area, and a sports book. They have an oyster bar, and a full 72 lane bowling alley, that's just great. This place is clean, and the topper for me and my wife, it's not bumper to bumper, PEOPLE! Yes you get the full Vegas experience without 10,000 people bumping into you and having to wait on massive lines. I can't wait to get a room for the night here, such a great hotel/casino, and they have a massive buffet which I'll be posting a review after this. Please, if you like to gamble, bowl for fun, relax and play the sportsbook or looking for a nice restaurant to dine, and you find yourself not in Vegas, make the Sunset Station your first stop!"}
{"text":"Had issues checking in because we didn't have the credit card originally used to make the reservation..and ended up in a room next to the elevator .. that made noise ALL night long. Coincidence? Don't think so. Clerk at the counter had a major attitude. Won't stay here again."}
{"text":"A good clean place a local can have their family and friends stay without being strip gauged. My girlfriend stayed a few nights, we lounged by their pool (nothing fancy but a cold pit of water) enjoyed their coffee shop and got good rest. I recommend this place for locals and their families."}
{"text":"UMMM WTF...Would you feel safe while your sleeping? This room is supposed to be a Jr. Suite. Maybe that's why it's like this. Isn't usually WiFi free??... no not here. It's $9.99 for basic WiFi???"}
{"text":"Sad to say but the place is going down hill fast. Have been staying here for 5 years and we'll never go back! Every employee there seems unhappy, buffet was unorganized and a let down, our in-room safe was almost cut out of the wall, lock was pried off, wifi is so miserably slow, Sbarro pizza has been closed for over 14 months and is still on the website!? The whole casino is very smoky, poor ventilation. They don't have ANY kid channels on their TV even though they offer KidQuest downstairs? No one seems to care here, it's so a shame. There are just so many other better hotels, we'll never be back."}
{"text":"Had fat burger I had a hot dog my son n briana had cheese burger. Another locals casino. Pretty good, cute cocktail waitress clean layed out in a half circle. Bars are pretty lack off I only found one."}
{"text":"Sometimes I'm asked, \"Mikey, what do you do with all the money Yelp pays you for writing your little reviews?\"  I always say, \"That's not funny, Mom.\"  I first started coming here for the Friday night Bingo Super Sessions.  Usually bingo sessions are like 12 or 13 games spread over an hour.  A Super Session is 20 games and lasts like an hour and a half or so.  You pay a little more for the extra games, but it's kinda worth it when you need a little more action.  It's an OK Bingo Room, nothing special, typical for a Stations property.  Unless the Cash Ball is high here, I'd just as soon play bingo somewhere else.  What keeps me coming back is the Gaudi Bar.  This beautiful bar is reason enough to visit the casino.  If you love Gaudi's work (Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, etc), this is a must visit destination.    Like all Station casinos, the Sunset Station has a great mix of Penny Slots, including a good number of the old first generation video machines I love.  I'm talking about machines with 15 or 20 pay lines.  That translates to 15 or 20 cents a spin.  Texas Tea, Munsters, Tabasco, Lobstermania, I Dream of Jeanie.  Love me some old timey video slots!  You can play for hours and hours on these wonderful old machines for just a few bucks.    It goes without saying that modern video slots are way more fun than the old machines, and boast much larger payouts.  But they're expensive as hell to play.  I'm not about 150 or 300 pay lines.  That's why I appreciate the mix of slots here.  They've got the new, but they didn't lose the old.  Mikey C says: sweet cream ladies, forward march."}
{"text":"I love sunset! I'm a local so I come here all the time. Great rooms, great bingo, great slots and of course, great food!   This place is fun for all ages! There's the bars for grown-ups. Bowling and movies for all ages! KidsQuest for the little ones.   The only con I can think of at the moment is the security they have in the parking garage stinks. My moms car was broken into not too long ago and some things were stolen. So just be careful when parking because security isn't very reliable."}
{"text":"Very clean casino,lots of good entertainment,gambling,games movies,arcades,food...but they don't show any love for locals like they claim...especially with room rates,when it comes to room rates,your not a local anymore at that point your a person trying to get a room...lol just keeping it all the way real! BUT THEY HANDS DOWN HAVE THE BEST BUFFET IN TOWN...DAT SALAD BAR DOEEE"}
{"text":"I went there this weekend for Punk Rock Bowling and it was Awesome! It is pretty big but it is not that crowded. Everything you need is around the Sunset Station. You have a huge choice of restaurants to choose from. There is a mall across the street and there is also a Wal-Mart and Best Buy. The Casino has about everything you want and if you do want to go to Vegas it is about 20 min away. So your good no matter what."}
{"text":"Beautiful  lots to choose  from on entertainment, but don't depend on a drink if your really thirsty. I stayed there for 4 days with family. It didn't  matter if it was busy or completely  dead ordering a drink at the slots would either never arrive or would take forever to get."}
{"text":"Been going to Sunset for years now and consider it one of the best off strip resorts in Vegas.   Sure; Green Valley Ranch, Red Rock and M are a little newer and appeal to the young crowd but there will always be something about the relaxed decor, buffet, Ben & Jerrys, and Regal movie theatre that I will always enjoy."}
{"text":"BUFFET IS PRIME. Always been a tradition to come here when I visit Vegas. After a decade I've still never been let down. (I even had a craving and drove 4 hours from California to eat here. Then I drove back) I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you've never been."}
{"text":"Came to Foodie Fest event and I tried Epic Tacos!!! Let me just say it was delicious I highly recommend them. They make their tortillas fresh. Hand pressed corn gluten free! The food sure is EPIC!!!"}
{"text":"I stayed here for the first time this past weekend for a wedding. I've never stayed off the strip before so this was a new experience. The hotel itself looks older and draws a different crowd than the strip. It's more relaxed and casual and moves at a slower pace. For example, the crowd is older and most places in this hotel close by 11 except the casino obviously. When arriving, you might be confused as to where to park. Don't park in the structure if you're staying here. The open lot is far closer to the rooms.   The hotel casino area smells of cleaning products and cigarettes. Not particularly my favorite. Don't worry though, the smell doesn't continue to the rooms. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms have a lot of counter space. I do wish that they had more outlets. Another tip, when using the elevator you need to use your room key. So never let your key leave your sight!   As for the night life, almost nonexistent which was fine because I wasn't there for that. They have a few restaurants but honestly just go to the oyster bar because everything else is far below average. Prices are great everywhere in the hotel since you're not in the action. The hotel is surrounded by well known shopping such as Target, Nordstromrack, and Macy's.   If you're looking for reasonable pricing and want to stay off the strip then this wouldn't be a bad option."}
{"text":"Don't go to Mandy Morgan to fix you up a room.   It's the night before my cousins wedding, and the bride requested a King suite with 2 bedroom WHICH by the way, Mandy Morgan said there is a King suite with a 2 bedroom. However, she definetly lied to get my cousins money. She did NOT mention that there are absolutely NO two bedroom suites, HOWEVER there are joint rooms with the suite but here's the catch, you would have to pay for that extra room which is $299 a night on top of the King suite my cousin had already paid for. And since my cousin is the bride she did however get a discount.. And we requested for a discount for the joint room only because they already screwed up our room situation. We were really nice to the manager, yet he started getting all aggravated with my dad over the phone. Talk about being professional.   WILL NOT COME BACK TO THIS HOTEL. Thanks for ruining the night before my cousins wedding douchebags."}
{"text":"Yes, there are people with mullets roaming the floors.  Yes, the average age is probably 70.  Yes, you are waaaayyy away from the strip.  But... where else am I going to get upgraded to a HUGE suite for $87? That's right, I said $87! I mean, the place was bigger than my apartment. It even had a jazuzzi! I should have moved in...  Upgrade aside...  - If you play in the various soccer tournaments held in Vegas / Henderson, this place is super convenient, like 5 minutes from the fields.  - Nice family-friendly pool...with a bar, of course!  - Penny slots. Try finding that at the Ballagio! - Easy parking. - 80's cover band (we didn't see them play, but a reliable source said they were good). - Grand cafe is old school with cheap prices and decent service.  That is all. I'll take that upgrade again now..."}
{"text":"Great place for gambling and family fun. It has a huge 72 lane bowling alley, two arcades, restaurants, and Imax movie theater. The hotels rooms are very comfortable and spacious with a pool out side for guests and locals(for a fee). The atmosphere is calm and pleasant with helpful staff members. Be sure to sign up for the rewards card for hotel discounts and more."}
{"text":"I made a reservation in advance stating that our family would require adjoining rooms and verified if that was possible because if not, I would not be able to make the reservation. I was assured that it would not be a problem and proceeded to make the reservation. The day of I find out that they do not honor adjoining room request as it is first come first serve and they are \"sold out\". If there is a specific request for adjoining rooms and it is noted on the reservations, why would this not be considered when reserving rooms for the day?! Not to mention the fact that I was on hold for over 30 minutes and hung up on twice before I was able to even get a person at the front desk as I was repeatedly told \"they aren't answering\" and \"they must be really busy\". I will say that Jacob at the front desk was the only one with any modicum of customer service skills and was at least attempting to resolve the issue which was not his doing. I am completely disappointed with the customer service both when making the reservation and when trying to get a hold of an actual person. Hopefully someone trains their reservation staff to be truthful and upfront during the reservation process to save families undue stress. Also, 30 minutes of being on hold and being hung up on twice only added to the frustration and disappointment with this entire process. Won't be staying here ever again."}
{"text":"Cool Spot for gambling and family night out. Bowling, Movies etc"}
{"text":"I was apprehensive of coming here but because family member was treating and was also paying I could have any say.   First off dinner was normally 14.99 but if you apply for players card you get buffet dinner for only $9.99. Most of menu was America, Mexican taco section, and some Asian.   American was typical meat carving (roast beef: chewy couldn't swallow, roast chicken: dry no taste, sausage: pretty decent).   Mexican: basically a taco station.   Some Asian: dried noodles, egg rolls: only cabbage inside, dumplings: not steamed & nothing to brag about either.   Everything else was dark, boring, and  too much salt.  Gelato ice cream was favorite part and that was  out sourced.   I wouldn't come back here unless you twisted my arm and got me covered."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the BEST time here! It was our first time staying here and we were not disappointed! We will never stay anywhere else and never in Vegas. Henderson is the cat's pajamas. It was super easy to book this place (did it on vegas.com GREAT deals there!) I think we spent like a little over a hundred for two nights plus the (hate these) resort fee.    The rooms were spacious, clean and my FAVORITE THING: I couldn't smell smoke anywhere! The casino itself was beautiful. I work in a casino in Laughlin, I smell like smoke everyday and this place didn't leave my clothes or my nose with that funk.   Check in was super easy! I think it's a great idea that they have a security guard by the elevators 24/7. And they want to see your room key before you can go to the elevators. I felt really safe and I wish all casinos did this.   The one con: We got stuck in the elevator a few times because you have to use your room key to get to your floor (which they should've mentioned cuz we've never seen this) and our key would NOT work. We ended up going up to other people's floors until finally we got our key to work--the other patrons in there told us they had the same issue. They should work on that... Plus it was hard to get our keys to work in the doors to the rooms.    The room itself was really nice. We were on the 15th floor (dunno if that makes a difference) and it had a nice bathroom. The shower wasn't hard water like I have here at home and that was a plus but the water pressure wasn't the best but the water stayed hot.   No room complaints at all. Didn't smell smoke, the beds didn't hurt our backs, the AC worked great and we had wifi (which wasn't the best but we made it work).   We got our player's card upon check in which was unique. It said you got a discount in the gift shop. We went in but apparently it wasn't good on drinks (water, soda) but I looked closely at the thing and I couldn't figure out what items were discounted... Like nothing met the criteria. No big deal we just wanted something to drink in our room with the pizza we got at the mall.   Another great thing, it's right across the street from the Galleria Mall and other great stores.   They have a fatburger. It was pretty tasty and stayed open late. We played a little bit of slots but mostly walked around and checked out the pretty decor. Everybody was really nice and I liked how easy it was to navigate being that it's a good size but not crazy huge.   The one thing that was sooo odd to me was how close their slot machines were to places that minors are allowed.  I don't know if their gaming rules are different (shouldn't be since it's a Nevada gaming law) but I saw several children just hanging out with their parents on slot machines. Last I checked that was a gaming law violation but nobody cared... So strange!    The cafe was pretty good too. Usually it's like going to a crappy denny's when you go into the 24 cafes in casinos but it wasn't the case for this one. Pretty yummy! Little pricey for steak and eggs though.   They seemed a bit short staffed but that didn't really affect our stay nor our great time. Check out was super easy. We just checked out on the TV and put our keys in a bin by the elevators. Parking was easy and we accidentally parked right next to where our hotel room was, what luck! :D  Overall, I think this is our new favorite casino. :D"}
{"text":"We have been here for a day and it's a wonderful hotel. All of the employees are so friendly and accommodating. Security helped us out so much with an issue we had after check-in. High praise for both Rod and Terrence. From anyone answering the phone, check-in, housekeeping and security the employees are top notch. Been the best experience I've ever had at any hotel."}
{"text":"The Rewards Center folks are nice but never have the correct information about events and special promotions. Twice I was told wrong information and wasted a trip down to play here. I'm always asked \"who did you talk to?\" Like I need to write down the names of the employees when I'm told something? What a joke. There are so many places to play in this town, I'll go elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I came here to eat since money was scarce.The buffet was smaller than I imagined but had very tasty items.Get a players card  and eat for $7.99, its well worth it.Also check out their court yard that has a few shops in there.Its beautifully decorated and is made to feel very homely and relaxing.Almost makes you sad if you go there without a mate like I did.Its, so romantic and cozy,I hate being single!  After I finished eating everything that was remotely visible vegetarian in site, I decided to take in a movie.  I went over to the Cineplex and saw the movie \"MUD\" starring Mathew Mcona(you know who he is, I cant spell his last name).The first matinee was $7.00 ,after that its more expensive I was told.The theater was standard and offered a middle aisle for people that have baby strollers I guess..or maybe the handicap.Lets just hope its not for people that want to bring their babies in a stroller in there!  The air wasn't too cold and the sound system was just about right. No complaints."}
{"text":"Sunset Station is getting old! This used to be the place to go in Henderson. Haven't stayed here in years and it needs to be remodeled. Sunset is, and always, will be my favorite casino in Vegas. I have been coming here for over 15 years and it has gone down, but it's still a oldie but goodie.   In Vegas for the night and hate the strip, so I decided to spend the night in my old neighborhood \"Green Valley.\" Never had any problems with the staff and service. My room was comfortable, but again, needs to remodeled.   I hope the Station Casino's out some money back into this particular property, because Sunset Station, at one time, was very popular!   It feels good to walk through these halls and have memories of the past. I just hope I can continue to make more memories into the future."}
{"text":"I may never go back to getting ripped off on the Strip again, great property with cheap food, low table mins and good drink service, the pool was also excellent though I did not have time to check out the spa , bowling alley or movie complex.  Also my room was huge and the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"We came to the Sunset Station Casino to watch a movie and meet up with some friends.  I normally don't go to casino unless it's to go to movies or play bingo or bowl. I'm not much of a gambler so my review is not based off the casino gaming floor or the Hotel itself. And more off the the staff and atmosphere.  Right when you walk through the doors  by the sports  book area you are hit with a wall of smoke, I mean I know some casinos let you smoke but this one is really bad.  Because we were super early we went in search for a Starbucks, stopping to ask a cocktail waitress where it could be she pointed to the directory and continued to walk away. My wife mentioned she might have been off but even then I thought that was pretty rude."}
{"text":"room was very nice and clean. Very good spot for seniors. My wife and I are craps players and have fond the dealers and pit crew to be very friendly. I want to give Kudus for some of the staff Lori and Ralph kevin Raymond lisa and bobby were great Thanks for the good time/"}
{"text":"From the moment we called on the phone everyone from booking, reception, housekeeping, security etc were nothing but accommodating and very friendly. We recommend staying at Sunset Station.   Recently,we had family visiting from out of town, who stayed at Sunset Casino. We booked the room for them using our players card and reserved their room with one nights fee on our card. Once they arrived we entered the hotel to no line, and a very friendly receptionist. Check in was a breeze they put in a note to reimburse our card (happened after 3 days of their check out) and charged our family for their stay  with their card. Very convenient and drama free transactions.  Once checked in we walked the long corridor to the guest elevator. They have an attendant at the elevator that requires you show your room key before you can board the elevator.  I like that random people are unable to just tour the hotel. The elevators require a room key to access the floors.  The halls are long, but very clean and inviting.  The rooms are pretty basic but clean and comfortable. There was no refrigerator or coffee pot. However, that was fine since they spent most if their time at our house.  The pool was big and not very deep. We felt comfortable having our little ones there. There was a lifeguard on duty who was very attentive. There were cabanas set up, and  a few chairs with umbrellas. However they were reserved. Wish there was more covered seating that was  not crazy expensive.  The hotel itself is very relaxing. It is a very laid back environment. It is well ventilated and spaced out. The ceilings are painted like the sky.  They have a buffet( sign up for players guard to receive a discount) a bowling alley, several arcades and a movie theatre.  If you save your movie stub you can show it at the bowling alley for a free game !  The Pizza place inside is good,but pricey. Overall, great experience we will definitely book rooms for family and friends in the future."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, breakfast was fantastic and Hardy. Great staff. Not close to the Vegas strip twitch is a plus if that's what you're looking for. Beautiful hotel."}
{"text":"Here is 1 of the local casino that I love playing when I come visit.  I never stayed here so my review is about the rest of the casino.  They have the machines I love (I play the 1 cent) and usually someone in my party wins something there.  Not always a huge amount but at least they win.  As for the tables, they're not bad either.  It's a lot cheaper here than playing at Green Valley or on the strip.  The Hooters here is like any other Hooters in CA.  The buffet is decent.  It's not the best and it's not the worst either.  Most of the time, we either at the buffet, fat burger, or at Sunset Cafe (which is open 24 hours).  Some of the cafe food isn't good like the cornbeef hash, but their steak and eggs are just like everyone's else steak and eggs in the other casinos.  Plus if you're tired of gambling, there is a shopping mall across the street."}
{"text":"Machines are very tight. Walk around the machines and look at the people playing, all with a low amount. I've won many in other casinos but the machines are meant to eat your money on this one. I suggest not going into this one. At the end of the day, its your choice. Good-luck!"}
{"text":"Definitely a Locals casino! I really like this stations casino however I love clear across town and honestly only come to this one if I'm in the area! If you are looking for a bother friendly locals casino that really loves it's locals than this is the spot! Not to mention they have the famous Oyster bar located inside! It's a much to hit the slots and or tables and stop by that restaurant! Yum!"}
{"text":"I happen to like the Lomi Lomi that is offered at their buffet. The Lomi Lomi is prepared using fresh salmon marinated in authentic Samoan style.  Someone actually pays attention to authenticity!  The locals know the machines and which ones pay off.  They literally own the seats in front of those machines.  Table games are the only game here.  I did find one video Jacks or Better that pays 9/6 which is rare in Henderson or in Las Vegas  Rooms and accommodation. Don't look for anything great unless you pay for the suites.  Over all, this is a budget hotel casino."}
{"text":"Love the pool. As a local it's convenient, and comfortable. My only beef is the pool menu. If you guys don't have it or make it at the pool- don't advertise it.  I was wanting a smoothie, and the bartender told me she didn't make any of them! You know, not everyone drink alcohol! If you don't make it, take it off the menu."}
{"text":"I highly enjoyed this casino. I loved the architecture and design of the entire hotel & casino. The room was nice.  You don't need to leave this place when visiting. They have a huge pool, a 72 lane bowling alley, various restaurants: Grande Cafe has incredible midnight to 6 a.m. specials. The prime rib is insane!! It is enormous with steamed vegetables and a baked potato that is ridiculously huge. There is also an IMAX theatre, various bars and clubs.  Great entertainment: every Friday night there is 80s night and every Saturdays country music band: Sam Riddle. A lot of fun full of high energy.  I very much appreciated staff employee: Anita who works in the casino. She was very humble, friendly and helpful! She gave me some tips on the players card reward and what it is good for. Greatly appreciated. I am looking forward to staying at Sunset Station again!"}
{"text":"This review is for my room only. The rest of our three day stay was enjoyable.  I've stayed in many hotel rooms, but this is the first time I've stayed in one with no coffee pot. Not only no coffee but no small fridge and no ironing board."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent a few nights here before he left for Iraq. Since the military footed the bill, I cannot say anything about room rates. The room we stayed in faced a parking lot, but was on a high enough floor to still give us a great view. The windows in the room were huge! Not like the fake ones you find in a cheaper hotel, where the curtains make you think there's more window than there really is. The casino area was bright and roomy. It made me feel like we were outside in the sunshine, even thought I knew it was already dark outside.  We tried two of the hotel's restaurants: The Sonoma (Cellar?) Steakhouse, which is on the very expensive end, and the cafe that served breakfast at a decent price. I can't remember the name, sorry. Breakfast was great though.  I know the hotel has a pool, too, but we didn't try it out. We spent alot of time in our room. Another great benefit to the hotel, is that it's so close to so many things to do. One of the malls is just across the street, and Last Shot Tattoo (great place, too) isn't far either. All-in-all, I think this is a great place. :)"}
{"text":"Reply underrated. Expected it to be mediocre at best, but they've always surprised. The restaurants I've tried have been nice. There are good odds on table games."}
{"text":"Enjoy taking a staycation at this hotel because the room rates are reasonable, nice atmosphere, friendly service, clean rooms.  Have been here several times!  The hotel is in an area where there is other things you can go do/visit such as the Galleria mall which is walking distance along with plenty of restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"This is only about Gaudi Bar at Sunset Station Casino: In all the years coming to Las Vegas, we've never had such terrible service. Sunset Station Casino was one of our favorite places to eat, drink and gamble. 2/27/17 Things changed. We sat at the Gaudi Bar 7pm located in the middle of the casino. Immediately when we sat down, I knew it wasn't going to be a good  experience. Jenny the bartender, saw us sit down and looked directly at us and walked to other customers on the other side of the bar. We sat there, and said...what's that about? Then after that, she asked us what we wanted. No smile, no welcoming expression, just a dead stare. I ordered a Heineken light, and my  wife ordered a grey goose martini. At which point Jenny asked if we were gonna play video poker. We said yes, then Jenny tells my wife she can't have grey goose and she could substitute absolut instead. Instead of saying, we have grey goose, but she'd have to charge for it, if we wanted it. Which would be fine. We weren't trying to  get free $2 beers and a $7 drinks. My wife said, that Absolut would be fine, I got my  beer and we thought that was that. We played and talked for a short time, I finished my beer and asked Jenny for another one. BOOM! That's when it got really bad!  Jenny walks away, comes back with my beer and starts scolding me. Saying I'll  comp this beer, but I'll have to pay for the next one. I asked if there was a problem? She then says the video poker machine wasn't registering any play. Then she says maybe I'm not playing the max. We've been coming to Las Vegas for 25 years. I then tell Jenny I've been playing the max and if somethings wrong with my machine, I'll switch to the next one. I ask her if anyone else has had a problem with my machine? She looks at me dead faced again and says with an attitude NO. I lost it, I asked the other bartender to call a manager. Luckily, Melanie swing shift manager came immediately. I told her how we felt, and she was so nice. She apologized and asked if she could do anything to make it better. I told her, I didn't want the beer Jenny left and actually didn't  want anything at that point. Melanie gave me Jerry Caswell her bosses direct  number to call and that she'd let him know what happened the next day. Both me and  my wife have over 40 years combined in the service industry (restaurants) so we know when we are being treated badly. All Jenny had to say was, I'm sorry but I'm not registering enough play for me to comp your drinks. Simple...I would have just paid our tab and that would be that. But to cop an attitude from the start was unexceptable. This is how Jenny  made us feel: Definition of cop an attitude. US, informal. : to show that one believes he or she is more important or better than other people by behaving in a rude or unpleasant way When we got home, I decided to call Jerry for a follow up and let him know how upset I was.  He was sympathetic and apologized again. He said that it doesn't sound like Jenny and that she's been with Sunset Station since they've opened. I told him, unfortunately it shows... He said he'd talk to Jenny and try to find out what happened. He also said, he'd like to make it right next time we travel to Las Vegas and to give him a call before we arrive. I kindly  told him thank you, but again we weren't looking for any comps or freebies. After that bad  experience at the bar, we still went to the Oyster Bar for the Pan Roast Combo. I told the cook Jesus what happened and he apologized for Jenny's bad behavior. He said, he'd do whatever he could do, to make it right. Jesus actually remembered us from last year. He said he remembered us, and went on into detail to tell us specific things that we had talked about, even after a year. He made us feel important, special and welcomed. I ordered 2 Heineken light beers at $5 each and then Jesus's manager over heard me and came up to extend his apologies to what happened and said he gave us a 15% discount on our dinner. To make a very long story short: TOO LATE, LOL. Don't sit on the bar if Jenny is working!"}
{"text":"Great hotel casino. Especially great service at the pool.  Best bartender ever is Erica! She makes sure to be attentive and talks to you as though you're a long lost friend.  The other bartender the day before just gives you margarita without asking you anymore questions. Erica asked if you want it on the rocks, with salt and either clear or gold tequila. Wish she was at every bar."}
{"text":"I used to live in Vegas and this has always been a locals casino.  Out of town guests looking for the true Vegas experience should stay on the strip.  South Point Casino offers the same amenities (movies, bowling, huge pool and hot tub) for very reasonable prices. if you are on a budget but wanna do Vegas south points the way to go.  Sunsets for locals.  It's cheap, but far away from the Vegas you are looking for.  Pros:  nice room, clean, no crowd Con:  no crowd, older crowd (65+), far from the strip"}
{"text":"I used to live across from this casino at one point. The Sportsbook is really accessible and it's probably the easiest one to get in and out of among all the Station Casinos.  Outside of that, there really isn't any solid positives for coming here. The buffet is subpar compared to Green Valley Ranch, as well as the other restaurants located in it are inferior quality in comparison to the other Station Casino counterparts i e the oyster bar here is terrible. But you must go to the oyster bar in the Palace Station!!! So unless you're placing a sports bet, drive the extra distance and go to Green Valley Ranch for better service, food, and experience."}
{"text":"We came here for the lunch buffet and were happy with the service we received. The price was great and the food was what we expected.. nothing overly exciting but not poor quality either. We came on St Patrick's day and we're seated right away. Our server went out of her way to ensure we were satisfied at all times."}
{"text":"This off strip locals casino is quite large with a good mix of slots and video poker games,  though sadly they keep taking out more and more video poker machines (stop it!) Their cocktail service is good but is excellent when Theresa is working (her station is closest to the mexican restaurant). Her smile, friendliness and efficiency makes her a rarity today and she should be acknowledged. The casino floor has so much going on: they have a food court, 24/7 cafe, small food court, mexican restaurant, italian restaurant , starbucks, buffet, 24/7 gift shop, movie theater, bowling alley, good sized bars (try their frozen margaritas!), a real nice sports book, decent outdoor pool. They have covered parking garage and a lot and it's free! I must add though they have the worse players club/rewards in Vegas including the strip and is the only reason we don't visit more often."}
{"text":"Been coming and staying here since 2002. We live here now and enjoy staying at the hotel. Me and my kids booked a junior suite and as always, are enjoying our time together here. So many choices for food not to mention Starbucks is onsite as well. Love it here."}
{"text":"I called the hotel to make a reservation but specifically asked for an early check-in. The receptionist asked what time, and I asked for a 10 am check-in.  She assured me that would not be a problem. I let her know that would be the reason that I would be choosing the hotel, and again she assured me it would be no problem.   After a five hour, early morning drive I was told at checkin that they were booked up and I would have to wait until people checked out.  In addition, I found out there was an additional charge of $15, but it would not be charged if I didn't get in by 11.   I wasn't even aware that there was a charge.   It is now 11:45.   I have been sitting in the lobby for an hour and have gone to the desk twice.  No \"here's five dollars to gamble with for the misunderstanding.\"   Nothing.   And this is a $189 room.    Will never return."}
{"text":"Gaudi Bar ask for Russell. This casino has a nice layout.  The movie theatre is pick your own seats which can be good except we only had the option for front row.  The best thing about this casino is Russell the bar tender at Gaudi Bar he is amazing.  I usually don't drink Martinis but he is very creative.  I guarantee he will make a martini you like."}
{"text":"Had a great weekend here!. We have visited a number of times without staying. (We have family in the LV area that we usually stay with). We had a great stay here.  Initially our room was not as promised. (we were promised a mini-suite with a king bed).  Management went beyond the call of duty to correct the situation! We truly appreciated it.   Room was outstanding - service incredible - and the buffet was amazing! Thanks,"}
{"text":"Just returned home after an amazing stay at Sunset Station with my family. The staff was great with making suggestions and preparing a banquet room for our big get-together, the food was great, and the rooms were clean and comfortable.   One of us reserved a king suite so that we'd have a place for the family to gather in the evenings with the kids. Our group of 21 ranged in age from 4 to 94, and there was something for everyone to do. We rented a cabana by the pool for one day (where the service and food was also great), spent part of another day a short distance away at Cowabunga Bay, bowled, watched movies, ate (too much!), gambled, partied, and visited.   What a great location for a family reunion. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"GREAT PRICE, BUT SMOKE FROM OTHER ROOMS WAS COMING INTO OUR NON-SMOKING ROOM.  SMOKE IN OUR ROOM: The room, the hotel, and the amenities were all very very nice but a huge problem was that even though we requested and got a non smoking room, there were times (most of the time) that we could definitely smell smoke in our room due to it coming through the ventilation. I really don't mind smelling some smoke once in awhile in public places where it is appropriate, like outdoors where it is mixed with a little fresh air, but the air was smokey so much of the time that we were still smelling smoke even when we were not inside the hotel or even near smoke. This was a major thumbs down since this hotel is also a casino and everywhere else in the hotel was constantly filled with smoke, so our room was really the only place we could get away from the smoke while we were inside the hotel- yet it really wasn't.  _______________________________________   RESTAURANTS / FOOD: Also, even though some of the places to eat in the hotel were non-smoking, they shared the same space as the casino and were also constantly filled with smoke - like I said, don't mind smelling some smoke outside, but these restaurants had no outside seating, which made it very difficult to enjoy the food. At the buffet some of the food was good, however some of it was just downright awful - and I am not at all picky. Unfortunately the bad tasting food stays in mind more than the food that was good.  _______________________________________   IN GENERAL: Great amenities; really fun huge bowling alley, nice outside pool, lots of restaurant choices, movie theater in hotel, and literally right across the street from shopping mall. The price of the room was exceptional and the service was also excellent, except they didn't offer to do anything or compensate us in any way for the smoke being in our non smoking room - Is this the price you have to pay for getting an inexpensive room? It shouldn't be. We actually decided to come home a day early because we were tired of smelling smoke all the time.   _____________________________________________ _____________________________________________   MY RATINGS ON TRAVELOCITY:  Value for Money: I would have marked 5 out of 5 except that I don't think getting a good deal on the room is an excuse for having to tolerate smoke in a non-smoking room.  Staff & Service: were excellent overall and I would have marked 5 out of 5 if they would have offered to do something to compensate for the smoke in our room as well as if the food at the buffet had tasted better.  Room Quality: The room was very nice for a 3 star hotel, in fact nicer than expected - more like a 4 star hotel room. If it weren't for the smoke in our room, I would have marked 4 out of 5.  Cleanliness: Also would have marked 5 out of 5 if we didn't have to deal with the smoke in our room and the buffet. Because cleanliness also refers to air cleanliness - other than that, the hotel was spotless the whole time we were there.  PROS: Wi-Fi, friendly staff, great amenities, close restaurants, exceptional rate, pet friendly.  CONS: smoke in our non-smoking room, smoke in the buffet, and there is a resort fee/amenities fee that is charged per night."}
{"text":"I'm rating this a three star for my overall experience with this casino in general. The first time I've ever been here was just for the buffet. The BF said he's come here since a child with his family and they had the \"best\" buffet. EH, yea, I'm sure it was back in the days!! It was mediocre. The reason why I'm giving it a three star instead of a one or two is because they had these two amazing ladies who helped us sign up for their rewards program. They were so attentive yet not pushy like the other \"younger\" strip casino waitresses.   Besides all of the above, I would not stay at this hotel again. I only stayed in Vegas for one night, it was cheap, but saving the extra $40 wasn't worth it. The bed was HARD, the room service and front desk people were not friendly whatsoever. I mean, what happened to those two ladies a year ago?! They also never explained what the room charges were. There were two different taxes, the $14.99 amenity charge which were DID NOT use - asked them if they could waive it because their WIFI didn't even work!! it was SLOWER THAN A SNAIL.....   OH their shower head leaks and sprays water EVERYWHERE and if you didn't know what the hell to do, you're basically SOL (you had to turn the shower head left and right so stop the spraying. As for LADIES, beware, they have the worse lighting to do make up - it's a incandescent light which makes it yellow, but it was the worse one ever to where, you couldn't even tell if your foundation/powder blended well, so that was a total bummer to go out without knowing if my make up was ok or not.   The only reason why we really take this 20 min drive out this way, is because we like the outside environment. It makes it feel like you're home because the grocery store, CVS, local restaurants are all down the same street. Beats spending a fortune for one meal.   Although, I wish they had a microwave/fridge in their deluxe rooms. EH, like I mentioned before, this was a BUST. Will not stay here again..AND I change my mind, it's now a 2 instead of a 3. That's how sad I am about this place. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Very budget friendly hotel.  Stayed here because of a family reunion.  We usually stay on the strip.  The rooms were clean.  The bathrooms were very motelish.  Nothing fancy at all.  The rooms had a very modern updated look but the bathrooms were stale and old looking.  No room service available.  The rooms do not have mini fridges but you can call and request one.  One power outlet on a lamp.  Luckily we travel with a power strip and could charge our multiple devices.    Lots of shopping and restaurants in the surrounding area.  Within the hotel they have a bowling alley, a movie theater and nice size pool.  They do sell pool passes to local residents.  We had breakfast in the buffet at 10:30 am and were told they were already serving lunch items so we had to pay the higher price.  Not really sure when they offer the $6.99 buffet as we seem to miss it the 2 times we ate there.   If you are traveling with small kids this would be a nice budget friendly hotel.  Just traveling with 2 adults this is not your Las Vegas lights and action kinda resort."}
{"text":"I think this is the best of the stations. It's in a nice area right by galleria mall. It's super clean and they just got a bunch of new games. The food at the restaurants is really yummy. The buffet is decent fir the price you can't beat it. I've stayed here and we had a alot of fun."}
{"text":"I do not gamble, but we always come here for family fun. Whether it is bowling, going to the movies, hitting up the arcade, choking down at the buffet, or grabbing some ice cream before the show.  Bonus: they have a Fat Burger! I always leave smiling, so that's what matters.  To me, the buffet isn't the greatest, but my kids get down on it. They ask to go eat there, so anything that fills my growing boys and costs only $12, I'm good for.  The only thing that gets me is the Starbucks is literally touching the movie theatre. It screams, \" Get a Carmel Macchiato for the show!\" But no, you cannot. They do not let you bring it in. I get it, no outside food or drinks. But could you not have them touching? It's torture! Oh well, I'll grab a $6 water instead."}
{"text":"I think this is about 15-20 minutes from Las Vegas strip or airport. I stayed here for a business trip. I got a super sweet upgrade to a suite...way more than I expected. The room was pretty cheap too, but beware of amenity fee. ALso has a hooters, movie theater and bar in hotel. Had fun and I will remember this place when I come back for fun not work."}
{"text":"So here's the thing at first I thought I wouldn't really hang out in casinos outside the strip when I moved to Vegas, but I tell you I find myself at sunset often and I really enjoy it! It's a one stop shop for a night out with my boyfriend. We went to eat at feast Buffet which was perfect for the price, then gambled on the slot machines and then went to a movie! The theater is nice, the buffet has a nice atmosphere, there's sometimes bands in the casino which is fun, and they have a great selection of slot machines. Honestly I'm kinda falling in love with coming here it's always a good time without all the craziness of the strip."}
{"text":"I have to say..... I NEVER expected to have so much fun at this casino! Hub and I arrived on a Thursday night comp, never stayed here before.  Check in was easy breezy. We had a wine class at Total Wine so we walked over a short block for the class so we could have an easy walk back after sampling wines. Upon return, we decided to play.  First off....this casino is not crowded at all and they have plenty of games to play. We looked at several restaurants and determined we would definitely return to try out Sonoma Grill or the Italian place that looks like it has superb ambience! The room was clean and pretty modern....I expected Gold Coast like, but got more of a Southpoint like room.  Very quiet and very comfortable. Hub and I played forever on little money and had a ball.  Cocktails came by often and the servers were so nice! Next mornings no had a free buffet voucher and did breakfast.  The egg dishes were not that good, but the ham was glorious as well as the corned beef hash...yum! We will definitely be back...this place was a Blast!"}
{"text":"A great locals casino that has always treated me good. They have a lot of machines that I like to play and the movie theater and bowling alley are awesome. I would like to see better entertainment in the concert room like when they had Sam Riddle. And the buffet needs a bit of a revamp to it's selection.  I do love the layout of the casino and the maintenance keeps it looking new even after almost 20 years. The staff is always very pleasant and willing to help out. My fiancé and I love the Kids Quest as well. Thank you Sunset Station!"}
{"text":"Came with my daughter and stayed there for 2 days. Room was very nice and clean. We went to the buffet to eat for breakfast the food was cold. But girls in the pool bar were amazing they were on top of everything."}
{"text":"this is the worst casino i have ever been to in neveda, i was there on 6/4 1:30 pm playing craps after losing more than $65,000 i was very upset so i went to the bar to get intoxicated and ended up being kicked out, the security guards rushed me like abunch of ninjas and were very rude. they wouldnt even let me finish my beer"}
{"text":"Dinner at Grand Cafe....chicken quesadilla was ok.  Server was great.  Very attentive and pleasant.  Nice reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Buffet.  It is priced right for the value, but you also get what you pay for, a lot of eggs and potatoes if you do not eat gluten. There is an omelette bar so that will save you. Many others must have felt the same way because there was a long line. I was disappointed that the food was just warm and that does not work. There is nothing like eating a warm sausage that is not even browned.   For the price it is ok, but next time I will at least wait for lunch to eat."}
{"text":"I went here to the movie theater.   I wanted to see what all the hype was with the \"luxury\" seating.     Walking through the casino is a maze with signs that give the wrong directions.   Employees seem tired and short with customers.  At the theater:   The ticket counter opened just 5 minutes before my movie started .. I missed the upcoming attractions and was bummed.   I actually like to see what movies will be coming out shortly.  The concessions have become more like a fast food restaurant, offering everything from  pizza, hotdogs, hamburgers to popcorn, candy and even ice cream.  The prices are quite inflated, and you aren't allowed to bring in anything from the outside.   If you like to spend a lot for a pizza and beer, you'll love it.  The \"luxury\" includes a new menu of alcoholic drinks and leather recliners.   The recliners are comfortable, but can get warm to sit in for so long.  I'm not a fan and won't be back.  The increased price for 'luxury' can cover an extra ticket at a theater that is friendly."}
{"text":"Sunset stations buffet used to be packed. We went on a Saturday night and there was more staff then patrons. The food was decent from the salad bar to the dessert. Service was good. Fiesta is more packed."}
{"text":"The sunset station email offers are a lie. Their obnoxious Managers specially your Asian assistant manager who has no skills in lying needs to go. They told us to ask for a junior suite in the email when checking only and the first customer service representative told us they had one for $50 a day. I showed them our coupon for $29 upgrade and she got the Asian guy who stated these coupons were not valid due to 4th of July weekend, so it was $50. I still have the email and I will post it publicly so everyone knows what you are doing, there were no restrictions about 4th of July ?Next day we go to the Cafe to have breakfast. The lady told us it was a 20 minute wait. 2 hour later we got seated, the waitress came 20 minutes later with a bad attitude and 30 minutes later we hit our food that was disgusting and like it was made as fast as they could to be able to serve people so they wouldn't get mad. It looked burned, soggy and the steak had so much fat, the 12 oz became 6oz. The kitchen was not prepared for so many people and I complaint to the manager who admitted I was correct and gave me a 50% discount to bribe me. Next day we go to the buffet and it seems like everyone there is mad. The staff were cussing in the background, the food was very commercial and not attractive at all. The front desk didn't want to sit us next to our friends because after 10 people you get charged 18%, so they made sure we were on the opposite side of the restaurant.  Lastly we are at room 1105 and 1103 had this little kids screaming early in the morning so we couldn't sleep. We called management and spoke to Kirsten who suggested we move to another room. I have to move because someone else's kids are screaming ? That's a great managerial decision there Kristen? I believe the staff is not happy with their job which is transferred to the customers and it makes it really hard to be satisfued. Oh I forgot to mention a little kid pooped in the pool and we had to wait 2 hours. I spent $200 in drinks and never got a complimentary discount for the inconvenience. I've been a member since 2000 and when I first came here this was a very pleasant place to stay and park our boat and bring our children, now that's all done and I'm not happy."}
{"text":"The most recent visit to this place was my last.  A creepy woman followed me into the restroom and was trying to hand me a sheet of white paper asking me if I wanted to read something.  Welcome to the asylum."}
{"text":"Sports bar needs ceiling fans for air circulation. Too many cigars and smokers for an enjoyable experience for a sporting event. Great place to watch a game due to plentiful quality television but way too smiley not matter what time you are there. Feel sorry for the bar staff."}
{"text":"I dont think 3.5 stars is very fair. This is a favorite local casino, and one star reviews seem to bewritten by disgruntled out of towners who dont understand how vegas works. Yes, we have smoking hotel rooms. This is not california.  You stay off-strip for cheap, so dont expect strip amenities. Still, service is always great, sonoma cellar and oyster bar are excellent dining experiences, theres a movie theater and bowling alley, i often win at least something at poker, and, most importantly, theres a KIDS QUEST thatll babysit the rugrats while the adults go get some time to themselves. Yes, ive stayed at the hotel. No, its not ceasars palace. But its not motel 6 either and Ive gotno complaints."}
{"text":"Uh, well crud. We cant both have beer cause the concession mgr cant look how old I am. Sure we can wait for the Modelo tap. Ah crap my $1.49 cheese. Fudged it all up."}
{"text":"My sister is here visiting Vegas. I decided to bring her to the buffet at Sunset station. Very glad I did. We really enjoyed it. Living in Vegas for many many years I've had my share of buffets for sure but her appetite called for a variety of foods this morning. Surprisingly I was impressed. New items on the menu since the last time I was there. The chicken and waffles was a hit for me. Fresh and crispy. The corn beef hash was great. I had an omelette that was amazing. My sister ate everything that wasn't tied down and enjoyed it lol. Katrina was our hostess and kept our glasses full at all times along with keeping our dirty plates off the table. It was a great post Christmas experience. Oh and the price was very inexpensive. Worth every penny. Thank you Sunset station keep up the great work"}
{"text":"This is a good casino.  In addition to gaming, a hotel, and restaurants, it also has bowling lanes and movies.  Located across the Galleria Mall makes for a lot to do in the same area.  The buffet is middle of the road among the station casinos.  I'd say its a little better than the buffet and the Fiesta, but not as good as the Green Valley Resort which is their flag ship.  The pricing matches the buffet quality.  I'll be back there!"}
{"text":"The hotel room itself was excellent, large, roomy and clean.  The meals at the buffet was average but the coffee shop meals were of good value and large portions.  The hotel front desk was of no help, even though my reservations had the room and breakfast included.  They would not honor the breakfast and stated that it was my problem to solve with Hotwire whom I made the reservations with.  Even when they printed out my reservations at the front desk, it stated with meals.  This I thought was a little under handed by the hotel to accept the reservations and then to spring it on you when you check in is a bit unethical, in my opinion.  To rub salt in the wound, they charged me resort fee of about $17.00 per night and didn't get anything for it because I didn't hang around the hotel too much.  Still manage to have a good time here because we were determined not to let anything get in our way of having a good time."}
{"text":"One of the older station casinos I enjoy going to. It's close to my house which makes it a sought after place for gambling, eating or bowling. Parking never seems to be an issue since there are lots around the entire casino and a decent sized parking garage.  The eateries are nothing spectacular in my opinion. I have tried a few places but never returned with all of the other options in the area. I will find myself having a small bite in the \" cafeteria \" are with fast food options for a quick or to go meal.  I mainly come here to play the slot or bingo from time to time. I like the layout of the slot machines and the fact that they are not right on top of one another. Being so close to where I live I will come back from time to time but I usually drive a little further to GVR for my local place to play."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet and enjoyed the food. Restaurant was clean and they had a reasonable selection. Signed up for the player card and saved $3 per person. Friendly staff and they were quick to remove used dishes. Definitely would go back - want to try the dinner buffet also."}
{"text":"I gambled $2,500 & lost it. So, I thought about calling it a day. I requested the pit boss for a 1 night room comp n dinner for 2.   Apparently,  there was no host in the building at 2pm on a busy weekend. After a half an hour wait, the host shows up n denied my dinner Comp request but promises to honor my room request.   As I stated, I show up 3 hours later to check into the room they promised. The reservation was no where to be seen.   I highly doubt I'll be back to play here."}
{"text":"Sunset Station is located near Sunset and the 95 which makes access quick and convenient.   This is an ideal place for locals to eat and gamble.  If tourist knew about this place the strip would be in trouble.  https://sunsetstation.sclv.com  It has a great selection of slot machines and all kinds of video poker as well as all the normal table games.   Nothing is bad about this casino but there are two things that set this place apart from other casinos.     The buffet not only has an outstanding price and great food but it has outstanding employees.  I couldn't recommend it higher especially during the mornings when John is in charge.  It is amazing to me how all the help is smiling and working together to make sure everyone is satisfied.    https://sunsetstation.sclv.com/Dining/Feast-Buffet.aspx  Also the sports book is one of the best that I have been in.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.  It doesn't matter what you want to bet on horses, football, baseball etc. they have it all.  The director Chuck and manager Brian are always available and willing to help in any way.  https://www.sportsconnection.com   I'm sorry I can't rate them higher than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice hotel but rooms are noisy. Room next to mine left their tv on all night and room service didn't solve the problem. lots of screaming children running up and down the halls in during the day and early evening. not a quiet place to stay if that's what you're looking for. they should sound-proof the walls. Also, no entertainment at night. Won't stay there again"}
{"text":"Their buffet was pretty good as far as the food and the dessert, there was plenty of variety, it was definitely worth the price. The staff was also very attentive and very friendly. Next time I'm in Henderson I will definitely stop off at that buffet for their carved turkey"}
{"text":"I've stayed here many times and I always leave super happy about my experience. The prices aren't bad but the rooms are super nice! I got the cheapest room ($93) and it's honestly so so so nice. No stains. Clean sheets. Clean carpet. Clean bathroom. Comfortable bed. Great working toilet. And the casino and resort part is great too! It's unique and beautiful inside (the ceiling is painted to look like a sky, the decor is elegant). There's so much to do inside. There's a full movie theater and a full bowling alley. There's an arcade and also a daycare that's super fun for your kids. My little siblings loved it! Nice food options too! There's fast food (Panda Express, Starbucks, & more) and there's nice restraunts too. Buffet was so-so but it's expected at a casino. I'm certainly not docking down points for that. They also have a cute little cafe and a pizza place with GREAT garlic knots. I just really love this place and you sure get the bang for your buck. So many great memories here!"}
{"text":"This is a Locals casino and I would definitely stop in if I was again in the neighborhood. Wouldn't be in a hurry to leave the strip for here though. Great gambling with alot variety in games but didn't seem too much like a party casino.  They had automated Roulette machines with $3 buyin's  They had Deal or No Deal Machines Games were pretty affordable and had a decent payout. I mean you win more here than on the strip.  Also the biggest draw to this casino was their Buffet. Really affordable at around $10 with good food. Better than Circus Circus I can tell you that."}
{"text":"If I could give them a 1 start I would! We went to the bar inside the casino service was good but when I looked at my bank statement I was charged 17$ for something I didn't spend 17$ at that bar I only spent like 3$ I called the bar manager and he told me that they would refund my card in 2/3 days after a week went by and noticed my refund wasn't even credited to my account I called the bar manger and he never got back to me after 3 voice mails so I Finally contacted my credit card company and they are going to deal with it  So sad sunset that you couldn't even keep up to your word 17$ isn't very much money but come on your bar tender messed up!"}
{"text":"We stayed here while boating on Lake Mead. The staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was a mini suite and was roomy. The house keeping staff did a great job and kept our room spotless. The food was ok, nothing too exciting but when we had a complaint at one of the restaurants the asst. manager took care if it quickly and hassle free. The movie theater is awesome. Power recliner seats and you reserve your seat as well. We're coming back"}
{"text":"Cheap place and the food is so so...cost is about $10. You can get a discount for Sr and Military"}
{"text":"This place has it all!   -Excellent & HUGE bowling center! -GREAT movie theater with reclining/comfortable/spread out seating! -Great casino gaming with hundreds of games and tables to choose from! -Huge pool, live entertainment, nice rooms, tons of restaurants and buffets  Plus there is a Walmart across the street!  Super convenient!"}
{"text":"Nice place to stay, there cafe has good breakfast. There sports book is comfortable and have good size TVs. Good service and many different restaurants to eat at. I enjoy the oyster bar. Also you can enjoy there outdoor pool and bowling lanes."}
{"text":"Went hear for buffet... Food was good... The casher was not friendly at all she had an attitude maybe her boyfriend dumped her, or major PMS... everything else is good food was hot and tatsy..."}
{"text":"I cannot for the life of me understand ANY good review.  1. The place NEVER pays out.  2. Why on earth are all rooms pet friendly?? I don't want to sleep in your dog or cats hair. We eliminate smoking from hotels because of health reasons but then you stick someone with allergies in a bed that some jackass let his dog sleep in!  3. Oyster bar is over priced, $20 for a bowl of gumbo. 4. Stayed several days, gambled, took employees to breakfast and spent $300. Used my card the entire time. At the end of the week I had accumulated four freaking dollars in food comps?? Are you serious?? 5. The buffet opens late and closes early. Food was horrible and service sucked 6. No payouts! I never saw anyone collect more than $100.   I hate the strip but at least there you might luck into a few bucks. I live a few hours away and frequent Vegas for work. Take my word for it, Vegas sucks! Go to Laughlin."}
{"text":"What I liked: The bed was super comfortable! I can't sleep hot, so I got to adjust the temparture to super cold, too cold-my dad was pissed LOL. The pool had complimentry towels on each lounge chairs. The showers got super hot. (I sleep cold, but take hot showers - go figure) The french fries from the cafe. They had a Starbucks in the Lobby. The days newspaper was placed outside our door. Overall, the employees there were super nice. Wished a good morning/day from everyone I passed.  What I didn't like: The cafe in the casino was super disappointing! My dad ordered the meatloaf no gravy. I got the open turkey sandwhich. The waiter ASSUMED I wanted my dad's gravy. He mentioned it, I looked at him and said No, I guess I'll just scrap off the gravy - which I did. His face fell, but hey, don't assume what I want. How he does it in Hawaii doesn't mean I wanted it that way. The Iced Tea I ordered had been sitting there all day. I can tell when it's sitting past the 4 hour mark, I asked for no lemon and recieved it with a lemon sitting in it. After tasting it, I handed it back and asked for a Sprite. Our mashed potatoes were grey. The place was kept so cold, that after 10mins. the vegetables were cold. Not cool, COLD. It wasn't just the casino, the hallways were freezing. My dad was upset they didn't offer coffee in the room. You have to pay for internet, 20 bucks for 24hours. (When visiting a family member in the hospital, I recieved a free voucher good for 14days)  What was wierd: Friday I decided to go to the pool in the morning, two cleaning ladies were in the hallway cleaning rooms. A few hours later me and dad went to the hospital and when we came back that evening, the room had been cleaned and restocked. How do they know? Is there cameras in the hallways??  Checking in Thursday night and leaving Saturday late morning cost: $113.00 - not bad, but we decided that we won't be going back. We used a friends member card, I also mentioned my dad's a Vet and I work for the Government. Which could have accounted for the low cost."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I'll meet my Henderson friends here for a drink or three.  We enjoy meeting here because it's a fun place to meetup.  We'll head to one of the bars and have a Beer and for the gamblers in the group, they enjoy the huge selection of Video Poker machines offered.  Since I don't gamble, I stick around the bar area and people watch....good times.  The casino is always kept clean and the employees are mostly friendly.  The only thing I don't like is parking....I prefer the parking garage in the back of the property rather than the surface lot, which seems to be a magnet for road ragers.  Return Factor - 40%.....only because I live on the other side of town."}
{"text":"I valet at sunset station hotel and casino and they damaged my car, but I didn't notice the damage until I got home. They're getting away with it...."}
{"text":"The rooms were fine, the hotel clean.  My biggest complaint is the hidden costs.  $15/night hotel amenity fee (only hotel chain I've ever seen charge this), $10/day internet fee.  And if you eat at one of the nicer restaurants, you have no place to store/heat leftovers.  If you decide to split a $10 plate of pasta at the Italian restaurant, they charge you a $5 split fee.  Still may be cheaper than other hotels, but next time we'll stay at La Quinta.  No hidden fees, breakfast included, free internet, and fridge/microwave to reheat dinners and store our own lunch foods (both healthier and cheaper than eating fast food everyday for lunch).  My 2-cents worth (and if you stay here, they'll charge you an extra penny...)"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sunset Station for 5 days and played golf in the area. When I went to check out they had a $188 dollar bill for me. When I checked there were many long distance calls on my bill that I didn't make. When I asked they said they were made to Canada and they couldn't credit me. It was totally ridiculous. I have a cell phone why would I use the room phone to make long distance calls I was going to get billed for? Plus they were made at 4:30 in the morning when I was asleep. We tried one of the numbers and got a personal voice mail of someone I have no idea who it is and I guess it was a lengthy conversation. I am really upset over the $90 they are charging me for these. My company put up close to 40 guys for five days there that's how we get treated."}
{"text":"We checked in very late, keycard didn't work, needed two beds, they only had one. So..., they gave us 2 comfy roll-aways in a large King room. Then we were upgraded to a double queen suite, which was nice. Staff is very polite and courteous and my bill was adjusted accordingly. Thanks for making my stay as comfortable as possible."}
{"text":"This place is over priced. If you need Internet service while you're in Vegas DO NOT STAY HERE. I am using my cell phone to log on because the over priced \"resort fee\" which includes Internet wi-fi is literally the slowest, buggiest I have used in more than a decade ANYWHERE. Buffet is cheap but not good. Hotel is understaffed. Never again."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hotel - I stay here everytime I'm in Vegas. SUPER NICE rooms, SUPER CHEAP deals online. I don't gamble tho, so I can't speak to that - but for a GREAT deal on a place to stay THIS IS IT"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly  The servings are large and delicious I strongly recommend  You get a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This sation casino is outdate for me. The good think about it is what it has to offer locals. There the movie theatre, the bowling alley and my favorite thing, club madrid. On fridays it used to be you could see The WHIP its who are the coolest 80's throwback band. And yes you vant to touch his Monkey. :) :) Other then that i feel like i should be 50 years old in here."}
{"text":"What gets me is that $14.99 resort fee added to your daily bill. Why not just put it in the overall rate?  It is a shock when you think, wow, what a great room rate until you add this on along with taxes.   I can get everything at another upscale hotel with breakfast for the same price or a little less!   When I called to see if this could be waived, they said No!  So if you don't need the casino and smoke..... There are some fantastic hotels waiting."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sunset Station in years.  I went to a concert there last night and I took the opportunity to walk around and see what it  looked like again.  The aisles are wide, navigating the place is easy, and it's not nearly as large as I remembered it to be.    Bathrooms are convenient to the Club Madrid area as were bars--although outside drinks weren't allowed in the club.   Tip for Yelpers:  I parked in the back near the bowling alley entrance and I found places close to the door.  It was an area that made leaving the property after the concert and easy and quick one.  In no time I was back on Stephanie and then on the 215 heading for Summerlin."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our stat at Sunset Station Hotel. Although we aren't gamblers, the area met our needs as Hoover Dam is close by.  As far as this hotel, there was so much we didn't understand, and no one explained how things worked. We self-parked only to find out it's difficult to carry a lot of your travel gear into the hotel.  And, we got a free players club card and at first glance I said no thanks. Turns out, it would have had money on it (From $3 to $500).  The food wasn't that great, but as always, we pack our own breakfast and lunch.  On the plus side, the room was great---this is a non-smoking room that is truly non-smoking! comfortable and very, very clean. We got a great deal on groupon and opted to upgrade for a Junior suite."}
{"text":"Just got through three nights at Sunset station. I have to say, this is one of the best hotel casinos in Las Vegas. The bellhops were more than courteous, they got my luggage up to my room set my thermostat and had a bucket of ice waiting on me when I got up there. Courtney, the hostess, is a true professional. Her infectious smile keeps me coming back time after time. Not to mention the rooms are outstanding. I highly recommend this hotel.  Don't forget to go downstairs and get a few games in too."}
{"text":"At Sunset Station watching the Hockey game and paid over 10 dollars for a vodka red bull 2.50 for a Red Bull \"bump\"!!   If I want the entire can it is 4.00.  The worst part is they only give you a 3/4 oz shot!  ( which he spilled most of it).  Really? Thought this place was a locals place. Not the strip.  The atmosphere doesn't match the prices!   So sad to be that way with the locals."}
{"text":"My expectations were low and I guess it was slightly better than expected.  The casino is bigger than a lot of other Station Casinos and it has a wide range of machines.  Food selection is average and it is pretty smokey.  Probably the best spot on this side of Henderson, but that is not saying a lot."}
{"text":"I've stayed here twice now and I've had better experiences at hotels.   Room: SO DARK. There is hardly any lighting and the bulbs are very dim. This isn't much of a problem during the day but at night I kept bumping into things because I couldn't see very well. The electric sockets were also loose so it took a long time for my phone to charge. As far as the bathroom goes, the sink was clogged so the water would drain very slowly and there were some rusty parts of the tub which weren't too aesthetically pleasing.  Casino: I don't really have any complaints as far as the casino goes. There seemed to be a decent amount of slots and tables. There could have been a little better ventilation for the smoke but it was manageable."}
{"text":"Cough, Cough, Cough!   Yuk!  The Seven Dwarfs of Sunset Station can be found here:  Smoky  Smelly   Stinky  Stenchy  Staunchy  Swampy  Sweaty  Where's Snow White you ask? She valet parked, walked in... turned around and bolted for the door... never to be seen again.  Someone said she was screaming something like, \"Get some xxxxxxx ventilation!  Cough, Cough, Cough!"}
{"text":"Sunset Station is a solid four to four and a half stars! I'll explain why. I've been coming to Sunset for 10 years, and yes it holds a special place in my heart! It's locals, and it's comfortable! Yes the resorts on the strip are more luxurious. But who really wants to stay up in all that madness? Visit it while your here? Maybe. Sunset is absolutely perfect for families wanting to visit Vegas without it being too adult! We feel absolutely comfortable letting our teens roam the place without fear! They have all the gaming you could ever want. Including bingo that's not on the strip. Large sports book! A 24hr diner with those graveyard old Vegas specials! A very good buffet for $10! A very good oyster bar, Italian restaurant, great Mexican restaurant, a best of Vegas steakhouse, food court with the likes of Panda, pizza, Ben/Jerrys! They have a gorgeous 72 lane state of the art bowling center. As good as you'll find in Vegas movie theater with stadium seating! A large pool with infinity sides that's never crowded! The rooms are nice sized and always clean with nice views! It's just so comfortable, and so worth the cheap prices you can get almost anytime! You can have Vegas without ALWAYS dealing with the mobs on the strip! This southern gentleman just loves that his kids have grown to appreciate Vegas for the nostalgic magical city it is without being exposed to too much. Thanks to places like Sunset Station!! #SunsetStation"}
{"text":"Little out of the way but a pretty nice hotel!  (For the locals of course!)  Sunset station is located on the Henderson side of town on Sunset and Stephanie... it's so big you won't miss it...   First, wanted to tell you guys about the area....  Nice populated commercial area unlike some of the Vegas where it's all residential.  Across the street the the Sunset Galleria (I think), a huge mall with lots of stores... (GEN BBQ is new here too)  So lots to walk around.  Just down the street a bit is a Costco (For those Costco gas faithfuls), and on Stephanie, lots of stores, food joints, etc..  Now back to Sunset...  Pros: - Got a theater nearby - Pretty big Casino and pretty clean (not overly smokey) - Nice buffet with the pricing topping out at $16 for their Friday night special.  But most of the time it's under $10 bucks!  (If you play myVegas you can get these buffets for FREE!) - Nice stir fry section where you can get your eggplant dish made fresh!  (Eggplant in black bean sauce) - Pretty decent Slots!  We won't some of our share here... - Table minimum are not that high... Even saw a few $5 Pai Gows!  Cons: - You may be lost leaving the casino... so be sure to remember some sort of landmark upon coming into the facility.  If you walk out the wrong exit it will be quite a journey back to your car - Slightly far from the Strip, but if you want to venture out then it's all fine and dandy... -  Buffet line can be long due to its popularity, but at least the service is good  This is one of my favorite offsite Casinos other than Green Valley Ranch... so when you get a chance do drop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here. Ton for movies and food but the best thing was my son's birthday. We came to the bowling ally and the price was great and the lady helping was really nice.  The movie theater has been redone and is super great with recliners now.  The buffet is similar to the Green Valley one. Good... Not amazing but for the price good"}
{"text":"Best place to gamble if you're going to gamble at the blackjack tables because everybody is in a group usually and they do not want you to screw up their hands so they will help you so they all win at the table and so you win..  best hamburger joint is here an unbeatable prices compared to the country I used to come here just for the hamburgers the best"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Station Casinos. The Sunset Station is is spacious, clean, and has a nice Sports Book.  I didn't drop a single dime here, but based on what I witnessed I recommend if you're in the area.  Parking is also abundant.    Reason I give this place 4 stars is because this is exactly the type of casino that my parents love to play at.  My parents swear that they win at Station Casinos or local type casinos.  When they're happy, then I'm happy.  When they visit, I will probably take them here.  Also located across the street from Yummy Sushi and in the same parking side as Thelma's.  Can't miss with those two restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Sunset station is just alright. Let's intro with the food court. Fatburger, embodies the winning combo of slow, bland, and overpriced. Subway is going to be one day looked back upon and the human race will collectively shudder. Sbarros is just another reasons Italians look down on us in the states-we ruin nice things like pizza and red sauce. All suitable substitutes in the immediate area: In N Out for burgers, Firehouse for subs, Napoli for a pie.  Slots, table games, and sports book all designed to turn you broke, but with cheap liquor from a gun to numb you. Pretty standard stuff. Go to Dotty's instead, break down class barriers and your aversion to actually winning. Addicts play at Dotty's which means more vigorous play for looser slots.  The movie theater is overpriced. Hit up the Cinnedome instead. There you buy a ticket to the movie you want to see, and then buy a ticket to the movie that you could hear playing from the next theater over thanks to the paper thin walls. I'd seriously rather do that then come to this dump.  My thoughts are that Henderson, Nv is the opposite of a destination location. Conversely pricing should be lower to improve what an uninteresting locale Sunset Station occupies. Everything at Sunset is there, it's present. However nothing pops, you won't try any best in show kind of stuff here. The customer service is probably the most standout attribute of this place, pretty much on the same level as Target but far below an In N Out. The friendly image put off by commercials featuring Beatles' covers and smiling locals are far from the reality that is Sunset Station."}
{"text":"Awful room service! I've never had this happen until last week... and I will never go back now. Last Sunday we had a room service attendant walk right into our room without even knocking while the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was on the door. We politely told her we do not need service. So I called down to the front desk and asked that we not receive room service for the duration of our stay (stayed a week) and told them why. Of course.... the following morning, we had a lady, by the name of \"Luz\" shortly knock on our door and walk right in, while we were there. I told her about the sign on the door in big red letters that read \"DO NOT DISTURB\" and she completely ignored it and asked if she should change our trash. She did not have a room service cart, just a clipboard, which completely concerns me for when I'm out of my room the remainder of the time and what they are doing in there. If I had not been there to tell her we don't need anything, what are they doing in our room when it reads \"do not disturb\" clearly and means nothing to them? The first time was a completely awkward, inappropriate situation as it was, but for me to call and complain and request no more room service, and for them to walk in the room the very following day, I'm ashamed to have thought we would have received better service. Shame on Station Casinos for allowing this to be acceptable service, and I will not use them again (as a local) or recommend any of my visiting friends to stay there."}
{"text":"Ok, It's been about 2 years since I last updated this one, so Here it goes....This has always been One of My Favorite Off-the-Strip Casinos. One is that they have Updated a few things here. They now have a Huge Bowling Alley, with an area for People to Play Pool if they don't like to bowl, or just chill & hang out! They also have a Movie Theater, and Their Buffets are Inepensive...Provided that you have their Member Card. I've eaten here for Breakfast for $6, and Dinner for $8. Their Food isn't as dried out as some Buffets I have been to, They do have Prime Rib Nights & Sundays, they serve Champagne Brunches! Yummmm!!!  This Casino also has A lot of Personal Memories for me as well, that's why I Love Going here! And, I Will be Back Time, and Time Again!"}
{"text":"Into the wee hours of the morning twilight, watching the hands of my own personal doomsday clock inch one year forward, falling victim to the vicious evil that is Daylight Savings Time by 'springing forward' and thus 'losing' an hour, leaned precariously over a pai gow table with a vodka energy drink on one side, a perennially lit cigarette on the other, sitting happily ever after next to my soul mate?  Eat your heart out, Kerouac; this was no self inflicted soul search.  This was the final leg of my 29th birthday, and it was merrily celebrated as such within the confines of the Sunset Station Casino :)  First of all, the 'forever 6am or 6pm depending on your vantage point' ceilings are freaking awesome...  especially when it actually is the former and any shred of dignity you had left to question exactly whose company you keep gambling in Henderson at this hour of the morning is TOTALLY gone.  Second of all, it's lovely inside -- the casino tables have that awesomely old school feel to them, and the interior is adorned with god-knows-what gaudiness-slash-randomness to make you think to yourself, 'I think I like this, but wtf?'  And third of all, there is a freaking Fatburger inside!  Otherwise known as the savior of our morning.  The reason why Sunset Station gets a resounding \"Woohoo!\" from me, however, is the entire reason I go to Vegas in the first place: the gambling!  Now that Craiggers lives out here and has ultimately cemented his place as my gambling soulmate after this little experience of ours, we are SO coming back here.  1) The pit bosses are SO incredibly nice.  Try finding that anywhere in the swankified casinos lining The Strip.  As a matter of fact I hit a great payout hand and excitedly told the pit boss...  the current one AND the one replacing his shift.  Why?  Because the replacement was the one who was on duty when Craiggers and I first got there, and he got me my players card.  I know there's a lot of things wrong with that scenario so I'll just leave it at that.  2) EVERY dealer was super sweet, helpful, and hilarious.  I cannot deal with dealers who are sullen, or negative, or otherwise keen to making your experience as crappy or awkward as possible.  Most Strip casinos seem to take a great deal of pride in this, which is just mindblowing to me.  But here at the Sunset Station, at 6am-ish, everyone was so nice.  It's just such a testimonial to the kindness of the human heart when you have experiences like we did.  I won't go into details, but I promise you, lady and gentleman dealers of our acquaintance -- if Craiggers and I ever get hitched, you're definitely on the invite list.  (Don't ask.)  Anyway, maybe I was swayed a bit by the time of day, or possibly the fact that we'd stayed up all night to enjoy ourselves here.  Perhaps it was the adrenaline rush of gambling with one of my dearest friends for the first time, or it could have even been the heaps of praise for Craiggers ('he's so respectful, and he's so funny' just one example from our dealers) in conjunction with their good-natured entreaties to marry him ('or at least ask him out on a date' as the dealers pushed).  In any case, I'm in love with Sunset Station and I am definitely coming back in a few months :)  With my dear gambling soulmate, of course ;)    \"I mean, you ARE in Vegas, after all; why not get married today?\""}
{"text":"Review is for the casino/sportsbook only:  This place is quite nice.  On the inside it reminds me of the Paris with the \"sky\" designed ceilings.  The video poker here is pretty decent (comps are lame just like most Stations Casinos) and for me.....the Sportsbook is the draw.  Unfortunately, with as much as I like about it.....the distance from anything stinks.  It's a nice drive from Green Valley Ranch, LV Blvd, Downtown and 10+ minutes from Boulder Highway (Sam's Town, Boulder Station, Eastside Cannery).    What makes up for it, is that it is quiet and cosy.  The Sportsbook is one of my favorites now due to the comfortable leather seats (better than some sportsbooks on the strip/near strip) and the posted odds aren't half bad.  They have better lines than MGM Resorts sportsbooks do.  If you're a local this is a place for you, if you're driving by as a tourist.....stop in for a few minutes.  It isn't as nice as Red Rock Spa & Casino or Green Valley Ranch, but it's still on the decent \"tier\" of Stations  Casinos."}
{"text":"Beautiful, Elegant, Spacious... Feel like in 4 star hotel  When I need quiet meditation alone, I come here Sunset Casino hotel :)"}
{"text":"This was probably the first thoughtful Stations casino designed with an artful eye- showcasing elements not usually found in your typical casino. Beautiful spanish/mediterranean tile- I love this the most about this casino. The colors are gorgeous. The restaurants: Hooters- ate here once, the shrimp is delish, Oyster Bar- very good- ate here many many times, the Buffet- just ok for me, Ben & Jerry's- yummy combinations, Fatburger (my favorite fast food burger place). The amenities: Amphitheater- saw an all-star Jazz concert featuring Dav Koz and friends; general admission- had a great time here with my co-workers/friends, Cinemas- watched many movies here, the Lounge- small but fun- saw the Spazmatics here. It's a very good casino in the Henderson area with lots to offer."}
{"text":"I normally have really good luck here. The place has a nice sized casino and you normally never have to wait for a machine.   It definitely caters to locals as the slogans and commercials are all about locals.   The best thing is this place has everything in one location. Bowling, kid zone, arcade, movie theater, bingo, gaming and like 5 restaurants"}
{"text":"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times. The rooms are great. Comfy and clean. No refrigerator in room so that's a bummer. Ask for a lower room because the higher ones on one side of the hotel can be loud due to incoming airplanes. The buffet is fantastic and at a great price. There are various restaurants and a GREAT movie theater in this facility. Great gaming machines to choose from. NICE pool area but not open very late and since it's outdoor it isn't open year round."}
{"text":"We've been staying here for a few years now because the comps are so good we can't resist.  We are extremely happy with their new rooms.  So sleek and modern.  That long walk from the room elevators to the casino floor is still the pits.  More so, when you lose and it becomes the walk of shame but, hey, at least now I can enjoy the room more and sleep off those free drinks."}
{"text":"Ate at Cabo on Saturday with my girlfriend. The food and service were spot on and awesome.  I'd love to end this comment here, but sadly I cannot.  The server had told us that we might see 2 charges on the credit card and one would fall right off in a couple days. The second charge was for 10 times the ticket amount.  Needless to say I was shocked. I've been trying for 2 days to get ahold of someone who actually cares enough to refund the second charge to no avail. If it was a couple dollars I wouldn't care. But 200?!?! Would be nice to actually talk to someone who wants to help a customer.   Update  Sunset station took care of this 110%.  I am VERY happy"}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I go to Henderson we stay at the Sunset Station Hotel. We enjoy staying here and there's plenty of places to go to around the hotel. You can go bowling in their bowling alley and watch movies at their IMAX theater on the premises. They also have plenty of places to eat. There's a Starbucks next to the their guest check in desk for all you caffeine addicts like myself. Their pricing is very reasonable and the hotel is surrounded by plenty of stores and there is a mall across the way and a water park not far away as well. Sometimes you want a mellow and quiet trip out to Nevada rather than the busy and fast pace Las Vegas Strip. Sunset Station Hotel and Casino is definitely a little paradise away from home."}
{"text":"I go here quite often as a local. I enjoy the ambience, the ceilings are somewhat like the Venetian, as they look like the sky. Definitely a pretty casino.       If you are a local & have a player's club card (which I highly recommend doing), you can cash your checks (21+ of course) & spin a \"wheel\" to win a numerous variety of prizes. Typically anything from player's club points, t-shirts, buffets, & even cash prizes up to $10k. I believe there is even a car you could win as well as a \"double your paycheck\" prize. Even if you don't win anything exciting, you always get a free drink too.       I am not a big slot player, but they have a huge assortment of slot machines. I couldn't tell you how \"loose\" they are, but they sure look fun.      I am a table game type of person, & they have all types of games. You have your black jack of course, pai gow, baccarat, keno, poker, joker's wild, craps, roulette, & a few more.  The buy ins are typically cheap, like $3 black jack tables for an example. I personally like to play there, because you can play for a long time there.      Another thing I will mention is that they do weekly drawings from Thursday, Friday, Saturday, & Sunday's. You win the ticket entries by playing the table games & hitting certain bonuses (you have to basically remind your dealer because most times they will forget, sometimes getting a little attitude if you do remind them). The drawings can be anything from door prizes, money, player chips, & an array of other things.      They have a movie theatre in here, I have yet to go in so I can't tell you the quality there, but your player's club points can be used to buy tickets!       There is a kid's club too, it's about $10 per hour, but so worth it if you just want to drop off the munchkins & have some adult time for a little while. They even have snacks & food for them in there. My daughter loved it!      I have yet to eat at any of the restaurants, but every time I walk by that Oyster Bar it smells absolutely amazing. I will be trying it soon hopefully. They do have a Panda Express & a pizza joint there too.       All in all, the only reason I give this place a 4/5 stars is simply because some of the dealers tend to be rude & look like they hate their jobs. For an example, last night 3/4 of the dealers that cycled through while I played last night just had no personality. No smiling, no joking when we at the table were joking & trying to have a good time. If I'm going to lose my money to you, at least make it a happy experience. Don't be a fuddy-duddy & look like you hate the world. Every player at the table, aside from 1-2 of us (full table) had gold member cards. You represent your company, so even if it kills you, smile & if your table wants to talk, talk. Don't act like you having to do your job is an annoyance.      No, not all the dealers are like this, maybe it's just my luck, but the majority of the time it seems like those are the ones I get.       I don't want to end this on a bad note, so I want to reiterate that if you're a local, I really do recommend this casino. It is fun without the loudness of Vegas. So enjoy your experience there & make sure you sign up to be a member!"}
{"text":"Is this the swankiest place in Las Vegas? no, but it is a bit of a hidden gem. Great restaurants and a great location, not to mention a bowling ally and movie theatre. So it's a little dark, so the decor is a tad unusual. It is still worth checking out. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've stayed here. While it isn't necessarily 5 star diamond accommodations I'm always pleased with the service and quality here. The staff is always extremely service oriented and helpful. The live entertainment here is also always a pleasant surprise and terrific!  Restaurant choices are good and equally affordable. Last night for NYE, they gave out free champagne to EVERYONE!  Very cool.    No spa here or anything like that and I'm not a gambler so can't comment in that aspect but if you're looking for an affordable get away, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I recommend this place for those family with little kids... This place is for the whole family of all ages! They have everything here from kids quest to bowling.. Movies, swimming pool and casino.. Very relaxing compare to crowded hotels in Las Vegas will definitely go back with the family"}
{"text":"I was pleased at my stay at Sunset Station.  There is a Galleria Mall, Wal-Mart, Chevron, and other local eateries all within walking distance.  It is about a 10 to 15 drive to The Strip.  At the pool, there is no deep end.  It is basically three feet all around.  I would recommend going there right when it opens or an hour or two before the pool closes to avoid little children or the heat.  I slept in a comfortable queen size bed.  There is nothing too memorable about this place.  I wouldn't mind staying at Sunset Station again."}
{"text":"I'm going to get straight to the point. This is one of my favorite station casinos. I've won nice sums numerous times on the slots and today was my first time playing a sport's wager. It's a very welcoming casino and definitely has the local feel to it. I also love the Feast Buffet's Sunday Champagne Brunch! But I'll leave that part to another review. The only reason I am giving this casino 4 stars is because it lacks some of the bells and whistles that the Strip casino's have to offer. But hey if you're a local you should love it! Peace."}
{"text":"i tell my staff you can't be number one if you treat your customers like number two. (that is number two as in poop). well sunset station definitively treated a bunch of us like number two last week.  i am very disappointed to make this update to my previous review but the events of last weekend and this week have prompted me. my daughter was married last weekend and we decided to have everyone stay at sunset, even mom and i spent four nights there (so we would be close to friends and family and didn't have to do extra driving.) we booked about 12 rooms and for that they upgraded my daughter and husband to a suite...well actually a jr suite which is really a regular room with a couch instead of a desk.  edc was going on and the hotel was sold out so for the rooms we rented and everything else we did at their property they gave us $2 off per room and a $35 upgrade to my daughter, big deal. their motto everywhere is \"we love locals.\" are you like me, can you just feel the love here with the $2 discount? you know....seriously, i tipped the room cleaning staff more than that. you know i accepted that going in but i guess the the frustration came from the past five days getting the bills correct (was surprisingly hard to get the $2 that was promised) there were a few other issues on the bill but it was way more work than it should have been to get corrected. along the way i even got a \"sorry that's not my job\" email from one of the staff.   okay from the beginning i felt that $2 off per room and a $35 upgrade to a jr suite (not a real suite) for my daughter was a little cheap of them when we were renting a dozen rooms and staying on property. maybe i am wrong but i don't think the edc crowd does a lot of gaming, i know our group did, as well as eat and drink on property. (i think the bill at hooters alone was between $500 and $1000) the treatment i received was certainly not indicative of an organization that really does love locals. ever feel like a chump for recommending someone or something then they treat you like crap? yeah, well that is me right now.  i will say that when i escalated the bill issue to the gm it did get handled immediately and for my inconvenience they offered my daughter a two night stay with free buffets....yeah right..NOT, my time working through their errors and screw ups is worth nothing to them. they love locals....bull crap. that is just someones brain child in marketing that looks good on all the signs and makes everyone feel good while they take your money.   I am really ticked off about this for a couple reasons, first is well obvious...they tried to screw us over and made us feel like more of a hassle than a valued guest. but the main reason i am ticked off is that i really like this property. it is nice open clean, modern and fun. it is sometimes tough to find a \"good\" blackjack table but i have met with a fair amount of success. their buffet is a great deal with surprisingly good food. they have ben&jerrys, hooters, fat burger, bowling, lots of stuff. we have in the past recommended them to friends and family who come to town looking for something accessible to the strip but quieter. it is an easy trip from sunset to the strip via freeways. i am not sure if i will continue to recommend them. i dropped my rating from four to two just because of the treatment we received.   previous review: Nice place off the strip....way off the strip. Nice rooms, go for a suite if you can. Lots of stuff to do if you don't want to gamble, they have a bowling alley and theater. (even an imax but not sure if it is a real imax.) Short walk across the street to shopping. And for the adventurous, a long walk down the street to Costco. They have a nice food court area plus Fat Burger, Ben & Jerrys and Hooters.  Have had good luck at blackjack here but i think you need to start a fire to get cocktail service. But when you are winning it is not so bad when you have to wonder over to a bar and purchase a brew."}
{"text":"i normally eat here on saturdays nights at the cafe.  so ill just review the cafe.  i thought it would be a problem, since the cafe is sorta an open area to the casino, so i thought we would smell cigarette smoke.  but we didnt, so that was good.    food there is pretty good.  Not much of a selection, but what they lack in selection they make up for it in portions.  They have a teriyaki bowl (surprisingly good), rotisserie chicken, burgers, sandwiches, breakfast stuff, etc.  Nothing there really caught my eye, so i ordered an appetizer sampler and i was satisfied.   the staff was pleasant, and she was very attentive.  We came here during the olympics, and we were able to see the swimming races as they have TVs spread out over the cafe. they also have keno, which i dont play, but if i did, i wouldve appreciated it being there at the table.  but overall, a really nice casino.  they have a movie theatre and a bowling alley (ive been there).  the mall is also across the street, along with Borders and B&N, target, old navy, a plethora of panda expresses and many other shopping places. anyways, if youre just visiting and have no desire to go to the strip, then this is a nice place to stay (other than GVR)."}
{"text":"This is a great place for locals. Tourist may not enjoy it as much. It is a good place to gamble. I usually either win or break even, but I don't go crazy gambling either. Everyone is nice from the waitresses to the table dealers."}
{"text":"We stayed here for four nights and had a wonderful time!  The place is beautiful and even though it is casino the hotel rooms were free of cigarette smoke which is really important to me.  I am not much of a gambler but decided to try my hand at it twice and had a wonderful time.  The dealer and the folks at the table were really patient while I learned. The only negatives were as follows... 1.  We had registered three people to stay in the room but they only put two sets of towels in each room.  It was an annoyance to have to ask for towels and washcloths. 2.  There is a $16.95/day fee.  It is a resort fee but once you have walked around and looked at the place I am not sure what you are paying for.  There is a movie theatre which cost $8.50 per person and the bowling alley... You do get a free game if you are buying others.  The only other things are restaurants and slot machines.  WiFi is even an extra cost."}
{"text":"This place has a movie theatre, food court, buffet, cafe, concert and club venue, bowling alley, seconds away from a mall and plenty of gaming options for those of you who have a itch in there hands.  By the way it is just minutes away from its sisters Green Valley Ranch and Fiesta Henderson."}
{"text":"Review for the casino/staff. I came in here to use the $5 for $10 Ben & Jerry ice cream Groupon Now! that I bought via Groupon. Actually, I didn't even know the Ben & Jerry was located inside the casino until I called them to confirm their location. Upon arrival, I told myself, just ice cream, and then you can leave. Unfortunately, I saw one too many gold fishes and star wars slots and sat down to play and justified doing so since my ice cream should be eaten before going back into my rental car. Plus, the staff at Ben & Jerry was very nice and he told me that the casino had good odds and it's not as hustle and bustle as The Strip.  Before sitting down and playing, I walked around and discovered a bingo hall. I was in LOVE! I don't think I've seen a bingo hall anywhere in Vegas. I wanted to play, but found out that there was a tournament going on and I would need to come back at 5pm. That wasn't going to happen, but I would love to try it out if I am ever here again. The old ladies in there moved in ways I never thought was possible. Swift, agile, and amazing!  This is more of a casino for locals. The staff proudly wear their \"We Love Locals\" button. I asked them how the campaign was started and they had puzzled faces. However, they were very friendly and said that they wanted people to feel welcomed. Plus, locals have perks. For instance, there's a senior day with half priced food every week according to the casino staff.  It wasn't too crowded. The crowed was a bit older (mainly grannies and grandpas), but it was very relaxed and I felt that my gaming money lasted a little longer here than on the strip. Perhaps, the odds are slightly better. I loved that it wasn't smokey like some Vegas casinos.   The casino is pretty close by the freeway and a major street call Warm Springs that leads right into the strip and the Vegas Airport. There's also Sunset Galleria across the street aka a huge shopping mall and many restaurants and other shops in and around this casino. There's also an imax inside.  Free private lot. Also, according to the casino ads, they have a .99 cents breakfast /late night beginning at midnight through 6am for folks with their players card.  I knocked down 2 stars because it's a bit off the strip and old/outdated/worn. Some of the machines were outdated and a bit older than the ones you'd find at the newer hotels/casinos such as Aria or Cosmopolitan in Vegas. The lighting in there was also a bit dark."}
{"text":"me and a bunch of friends met there for Sunday brunch. we have the boarding pass cards so it was discounted. i believe it came to like 10 bucks. the place was spot on clean. the waiter was right on with more Mimosa's. the food was great. and we spent maybe 15 min in line. maybe. i would highly recommend this to anyone. the other thing i love is that it is only a 10 min drive from my place. i have gone to the theaters there and a few of the other restaurants. i am still impressed with the stained glass above the table games."}
{"text":"After minutes of driving around trying to loook for a place to eat and still we can't think of any anything and unsure of what we really want. We decided to eat in our favorite buffet place. We were able to eat all the foods that we wanted in one place in an affordable price as well!"}
{"text":"I stayed here in February 2018 for a wig training with Marquetta Breslin and Breslin Group. I paid for early check-in but when I got there, there weren't any rooms available so I could put my luggage up and I was a lil bummed about that..I didn't sleep for like 24 hours. #vamplife Once I did check-in I was impressed with my room. The layout was Dope probably bcoz of all the mirrors lol. The hotel is very calm and peaceful.. even with the hustle and bustle of the casino. I loved my room. I think it was just like a basic deluxe room but it was pretty nice. I thought with their rates being a lil lower the room wouldn't be all dazzly.. But it was. The staff that I did encounter were great with their service even the security/police that walks through the casino. We were at the bar chilling having our lil sips and the bartender was nice kept coming to check on us. I liked how security was stationed at the elevators (even tho my cray a$$ forgot my key a couple of times) no danglers getting upstairs lol. I'm gonna come and stay again when I'm not on business so I can really enjoy this hotel and their crab!!!"}
{"text":"nice casino.  Everyone won but me lol. Nice, clean and spacious.  A lot of local casinos reek of smoke but this place isn't bad.  I was sad to see that Hooters is no longer there.  That goes to show you how long it's been since Ive been there. The buffet must be awesome as heck bc everytime I go there, the line is outta this world. I live far from Henderson but when in the area (or in this case family was in town and they wanted some place different to play) Ill come here!"}
{"text":"Cafe review-  This is a review of the food and not the staff. The staff are great and friendly.  Been eating there for about 2 years and recently ordered the meat (less) loaf last night. Man you talk about fillers! I had it about 6 months ago and it actually contained ground beef, last night the three 3 pieces looked okay but the first bite told me that it was some type of meat by product...well at least it tasted some soy product.  Get back to basics..meatloaf made of beef and a lot less filler please. The gravy was way too salty and really dark brown...maybe been sitting out too long?  The Thursday meal...steak and shrimp was good but the same old/salty gravy was on the mash potatoes."}
{"text":"Overall this is a pretty good place. It's located off the strip so it seemed to be a more local crowd. We ate at the buffet which was very good as far as casino buffets go. It had a variety of food, all of which was pretty good.   The place also has a 72 lane bowling alley, arcade, and kid area."}
{"text":"I stayed here for 5 nights for a work conference. I really like that this hotel has many options for food and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only thing I hated was all the smoke in the lobby area/casino. It's not very touristy, most of the people that come to the casino are locals so it's not too crazy which is good! The group rate we received was very great and I def would recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"I do a lot of traveling for work and pleasure.  This hotel is the least customer service friendly place I have ever stayed in!  I will make sure that my company and friends find a better place to stay whenever visiting Vegas.  Please tell your employees they are not actually doing the guest any favors.  If guest stop coming here they (your employees) will be out of a job!  The front desk staff is especially horrible & that's your first experience!  Trust me it doesn't get any better.  There are other nicer, up to date inexpensive hotels to stay at in Vegas.  If you want a good experience DO NOT stay here!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great selection and everything I had I loved. Roast beef was a bit too rare but nonetheless delicious. I love their cheesy garlic bread  thank you for having mint chocolate chip ice cream! I'm definitely coming here to eat whenever I'm town!!!"}
{"text":"Our room was huge as was the bathroom with 2 sinks. Big, comfortable bed.  Plenty of closet space.  The casino is huge and has a ton of places to eat. The staff is very friendly. We only stayed one night but we would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"We stayed at Sunset Station for our wedding in April 2016. We were upgraded to a suite since we fulfilled our block of rooms. The suite was amazing!  Great place for me and my wedding party to get ready for the big event. Free shuttle from the hotel to the wedding venue which came in handy given our open bar.   We had our rehearsal dinner at Cabo in the hotel; the manager Mario made sure all went smooth. Ate at the Italian restaurant; amazing food. And of course the oyster bar which had excellent food.   Laurie helped plan and coordinate rooms for us and all of our out of town guests; couldn't have done it without her!  She also recommended hair and make up for the wedding which turned out beautifully.   Doesn't hurt that I walked away up $500 for the trip .   We will definitely stay at Sunset Station again, great hotel away from the chaos of the strip!"}
{"text":"This hotel will charge your account for things even if you pay your account in full in cash."}
{"text":"On Friday as my husband and I were driving through, we found a standard room on Orbitz for $70 plus a resort fee of $19.20. This hotel is very nice. Our standard king room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. There were so many restaurant choices at the resort at very reasonable prices. We don't gamble so after dinner, we found a little bar with some live music and enjoyed that for an hour or two. The resort has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great gambling and great affordable restaurants and friendly staff and gorgeous cocktail servers. Buffet is great !!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Love this casino! The buffet is the best in the whole city! The slots are fun and pretty loose as well! Folks that work here are very friendly and the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"I canot comment on room...did not stay...but after bad experience at hotel I stayed...may consider next time....oh wait a minute there's a $10 \"resort\" fee added to room per night...probably will pass.  Did gamble quite a bit...went for Monday night football for third year in a row when bears played vikings....$1 dogs and beer....good deal....went back 2 nights later to bet sports and play craps....dealers were friendly and won $200...cocktail servers at craps were efficient...but one at sports book on Monday I tried to get a beerr but she wouldn't serve unless I had a drink ticket...she called me honey...you're not my honey you don't know me....my bad lesson learned for next time.  This was my base casino when my friend lived there nearby..he moved away...very good poker machines and craps and not near as crowded as strip or downtown....joined Station players club 2 years ago"}
{"text":"I'm pretty easygoing about hotels & hotel charges. I read the fine print. Yes, their rates are awesome & yes there was a 'resort' fee, still pretty decent pricing.  Our stay here was pretty awesome. If you didn't want to leave the casino, you didn't have to. It was CLEAN (big points for that!) and the casino didn't smell that bad of smoke.   Hungry? So many restaurants to try. Most notably the Oyster Bar where I had the best cioppino of my life. Thirsty? Margarita specials in the middle bar for $2. I jumped on that.  Back to the room itself, it was a king sized comfy bed, pretty spacious and had a view of the desertous mountains. It was clean and I have no complaints at all about the room itself.  One of the main things for staying in Henderson was to be close to the Hoover Dam and all the shopping. I'd come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar directly in front of the front desk. I've been coming here since sunset station opened. It's been a bit since I've been back since gvr is closer to me. But tonight I stopped in here for a bit and decided to having a drink at the bar and the bartender named Sosa recognized me even though he hasn't seen me in about 4 years or longer and was very personable and friendly. Bartenders see thousands of guests and trying to remember a person from 4 years ago is almost impossible, but he did. It made me feel very welcome. I hope this review reaches a manager so that Sosa can get the recognition he deserves. He had outstanding service and because of him I will make the drive to come back here again"}
{"text":"The Stations Casinos are, as a whole, pretty good. Above average in service. Supposedly for locals. More out of towners been staying  there now. That says a lot about it. Prices are damn reasonable. Winning as well . I win here a lot."}
{"text":"I like to stay off the strip which also means staying at a hotel as well, off the strip.  I went and checked out all the stations for my next stay and this is the best place of all the Stations Hotel and Casinos.  There's is much more to do and see.    Oh..yes, I am hotel hunting already...and so far I like what I see.  Sunset Station Hotel & Casino...here I come!"}
{"text":"A very clean comfy room. Staff was very friendly. We actually left a free room DT to stay here for the bed.  The pool was a nice relaxing experience. Natalia and Amberly were both really friendly. Amberly is very helpful and gives great suggestions. Don't question her, just follow her lead. ;-) The tables were friendly as well. Never had a cranky dealer and the other players were usually nice.  Restaurants were yummy. My favorite is the oyster bar. We also enjoyed the steak house $29 petite filet and lobster tail were a hit. Not sure why we got a B-day cake. But it was sure a nice treat."}
{"text":"This is an average Las Vegas locals casino in the Southeast part of the city. It's one of Station Casinos \"mid-tier\" properties, with more upscale decor than the Henderson Fiesta location, but it's not as nice as Green Valley Ranch. This is a good thing if you want a slightly upscale experience yet don't want to pay out the nose for it.   Many of the restaurants, the buffet and amenities are reviewed individually on Yelp so I'll skip over them with this review. If I don't want to drive to Fremont Street but want to play some slots, this is a comfortable place to go. Service is attentive, they have a wide variety of slots including some new stuff I saw at the Global Gaming Expo that they rolled out fast. I haven't played table games here so I can't touch on them. Overall, it's just a good place to go in and chill out for an hour playing slots and having fun."}
{"text":"Great experience always! From the buffer, cafe to my last stop at Starbucks always great service have been coming to sunset station for many years! Thank you for all the great service! Always enjoy meeting my family there for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We came for the buffet, we had a two for one coupon making the dinner $10.99 for two people.  OUT STANDING!  We will return for the buffet."}
{"text":"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...  Review #10: way out east in Henderson; definitely catering to the locals & elderly, with miles & miles of slot machines, plus a huge bingo room, a 13-screen movie theater, and a massive 72-lane bowling alley; the kiddos are also accomodated with multiple arcades & an amusement rides area; the hotel portion is really set off to the side, so much so that I didn't even realize there were hotel rooms here initially; nice motif throughout the casino, especially the faux-balconies near the restaurants; they also have a very nice & quite large sports book that invites lingering; restaurant & bar choices are pretty basic, but the Oyster Bar is a cut above; overall, would have given them 3.5 stars if I could; best craft beer bet = the Oyster Bar for sure, which recently added about 10 good beers in bottles"}
{"text":"We stayed here on Fri. and Sat ., May 6th and 7th.  We paid over $300 for the stay for a basic King room.  The room was clean, but very plain...not even a vent in the bathroom. Do not expect a coffee maker in your room either.  You have to walk clear down to the casino area and pay $6 for two coffees. Then the topper was the pool area was completely closed on Sat.to hotel guests because of a tequila party later that night.  We were not even informed of this prior to our arrival. What a bunch of undesirables that party brought in :(  If you get their $40 cheap weeknight rate and just need a place to sleep of the drunk, then go for it.  Do not pay more than that for this hotel !!!"}
{"text":"We come here often to get away.  The suite is well worth the extra few dollars and has an excellent strip view.just a few miles away. Park close by the entrance and relax, and just go to the strip when you have a show to see. Wife is usually very lucky here and jokes about visiting  once a month to stock up with slot winnings..."}
{"text":"Just so you know there are over 70 \"not recommended\" 1 star reviews involving cockroaches soooo I would scroll down if I were you and read the hidden reviews and see what people really think about this casino.   Goes to show Sunset Station obviously paid Yelp to hide 70 1 star reviews. Just sad and speaks volumes about this place. Having personally stayed here two years ago I can agree with the other 1 star reviews on how dirty their rooms are. Motel room standards at Hotel prices. Why do the dirty Casinos always need to be where the locals go?"}
{"text":"It's not on the strip, but that might be a good thing... The parking is easy, it's much cheaper, well kept, and not run down like the strip hotels... a great place if you want the Vegas experience without the huge crowds and crazy $ overhead."}
{"text":"Great place to stay if you plan on taking your boat out to lake Mead. Ample parking.  They are also one of the only pet friendly hotel/casino establishments in the Las Vegas metropolitan area,  The rooms are very clean and it has all the amenities you would find on the strip.  It's Vegas without the crowds."}
{"text":"Clean and spacious room. Has the typical casino vibe and smell however that is to be expected. The hotel is about a 15 minute drive to the strip. Many options to choose from in terms of restaurants within the hotel. Close to shopping and food outside of the hotel. Great stay over all."}
{"text":"We booked a regular room with one king bed for the Wednesday evening we flew into Vegas. We arrived at the hotel just before midnight. Check in was quick and friendly. We were told we were being upgraded complimentary to a King Suite. It was gorgeous and we still only paid $30 bucks total. We've stayed here a number of times while in Vegas and it's always been great."}
{"text":"This review is strictly just for the casino and movie theater here. It's definitely not your fancy casino on the strip but I love this place! Dealers are friendly and I always feel like a winner when I leave.. Well most of the time. The movie theater here is my go to as well since I live right down the street. It's reserved reclined sofa seating so it's super comfortable and they usually have some of the latest showings around Henderson area so if you work late this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"REVIEW OF: MOVIE THEATER  I went here to see Prince of Persia. Got there and the line was like 12 deep with one guy working the register (slowly...lol) I could tell we were going to be there a min but it was ok, the company more than made up for the long wait.   We got our tickets and moved to grab a bite of something...We ordered the mini dogs but for some strange reason they had to call a \"manager\" before they could tell us if we could order them...ok, no prob. Let's just do the regular dogs, ok?  \"Ok....wait is it ok if I microwave one, because we only have 1 cooked now?!\" LOL... Ok, sure, I said (I was hungry, and we just wanted to watch the movie) so we got that and 2 drinks and luke warm cheese sauce. I was looking for mustard, relish etc. Finally I found the cart of packets..lol. No straws anywhere....had to ask them for 2 and finally just grabbed 2 from a stack because they were not paying attention.   Off to the movies =) we get to our theater and go inside....WOW - This is a small (no tiny) theater! I mean like 10 rows on top (if that) and 5 below. It was packed too. We got a decent spot to sit in, but the seats were horrible. My back was killing me the whole movie and then some.   The movie was great but if it had not been for my company and the movie being as good as it was (I am a fan of the game and this movie was killer imo) I would not have been able to deal with the experience. 3 stars is the most I can muster up folks.   P.S. The walk through of the casino was nice, the only downside for me, was all the damn smoke. LOL. And getting a cab was rather quick."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Great buffet.  Sorry, Best Buffet I have gone to in a long long time.  Great selection. Lots of room.  I go 2-3 times every time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out, they do have a Buffett but the section I had was nothing to right home about. They did have a nice salad/fruit bar. The casino section was clean but just seemed ordinary"}
{"text":"So.... I'm reviewing this place based on the event held there... Punk Rock Bowling. First off, I would like to state that they really seem to appreciate their guests and their security is quite resonable... even with punk rockers shinanigans and I think they understood many things were in silly fun.  Their night manager was superb! He assisted me with a matter and assured me that the problem would be dealt with any means possible and I was EXTREMELY satisfied with the service! Every member of the staff was there if I had any needs, everything from management, security, room service and even the maid staff!  I enjoyed the ability to drink and smoke at leisure and not feel bogged down by extensive rules... although my only negative expierence was while exiting towards the bowling alley, the area suddenly becomes non-smoking, which I was not aware of. I saw several old friends and starting chatting when a security officer told me it was non- smoking. I said okay and started walking into the bowling alley to put out my cigerette in the trash can, which he followed me then told me that I had to leave the building cause I had smoked... despite that I was walking to throw my cigerette away and it was already in the trash. It was so stupid. So instead of grabbing my friend from the bowling alley, cause I was rudely told that I had to leave that second, I ended up leaving by myelf cause I couldn't get my friend.   But since I was staying in the hotel it was dumb and only this one person with a bug up his butt.  All and all... this place was cool for PRB. The buffet is sorta gross and WAY over priced at almost $17 bucks. Nothing was good, but if you needed to soak up alcohol with large amounts of food, then this is the place.  I wish the bar had cheaper drinks. I ordered 3 shots and my friends were blown away when it was over 22 bucks and he charged me 2 bucks for a chaser."}
{"text":"Yvette Herrera is the best waitress at the Casino Buffett.  She is very attentive to all of our needs.  She has great energy and a great smile that lights up the room.  She is the reason we go to the Buffett everyday.  I would recommend anyone the opportunity to experience the excellent service and commitment to help her customers.  Great job Yvette.  Thank you...

{"text":"My 10yo daughter and I stayed here because she has a sports camp to attend, so I was not here to experience Vegas in the same way as I would with friends. I got a reasonable deal on a travel app site and thought staying at a casino hotel would be a little more fun/different than the typical hotel experience we have with our (nearly weekly) sport travel. Seemed kinda fun.   I had to pack snacks for the kids and thought to call ahead to double check if the room had a refrigerator. I learned that it did not and that I must pay $10 nightly (4 nights). I was a bit surprised because all of the numerous hotels we have stayed in have auto fridge but then I remember that we use Hilton Honors and that's probably why. Anyhow, before I could work this all out, the staff on the line already scoffed in a condescending way and rudely announced that fridges are never complementary. O. K. Got it!  Upon arrival, parking was super confusing and the valet never appeared so I drove around a bit, located a parking spot, and loaded myself and my kid up with some of our stuff. We then walked absolutely forever to the counter for registration. There were no lines and two staff were chatting at the desk making no attempt to acknowledge us so I approached the desk. Unsmiling, one staff member agreed to start the registration process. He attempted to get me to upgrade to a suite but I politely declined. The other employee standing nearby audibly scoffed condescendingly at my decline!  It was HER again!  Feeling a little defeated, exhausted from driving 7 hours, sweating from carrying  5 days worth if stuff for (what felt like miles), we finally got to our NON SMOKING room.   We were greeted with a seriously strong smoke smell upon entering. Seriously, I looked around for a lit cigarette in an ashtray it was so strong. I thought to let the room air out a bit (we ARE in a casino and I DID expect some smoke exposure) and not worry too much about it. We unpacked quickly and headed out to dinner.   The smell remained and, actually, intensified. By 4am I could not breathe and had a severe headache so I called down to registration different staff politely agreed to move us. I am thankful for that and the new room was clean and smoke free.   In all fairness, this was the end of our unpleasant experience. We stayed an additional three nights without issue. The restaurant and buffet staff were friendly and accommodating. The remainder of all security, service, movie theater and bowling alley staff were all really nice.  It is a fun place to stay and has many options for kid friendly and adult entertainment.   Despite the two rude staff members, we ended up having a nice time and was a fun alternative to the regular hotel experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  For the price could have stayed in nicer room. View was the roof of the hotel next door. Booked nonsmoking room but upon arrival tried to give us a smoking room. Even though I am a smoker wont stay in smoking room, upcharging $40.00.  Guard to go up to room was the only friendly person. Open electrical outlet above shower. Check out picture of refrigerator. Looks like picked up off side of road.  Not staying here again."}
{"text":"This is a decent locals casino. Occasionally the staff can be a bit rude. Table games have somewhat low minimums compared to the strip, but high for a locals casino. The buffet is inexpensive and generally decent quality.  Decor 2/5 Staff 2/5 Value 3/5"}
{"text":"Do not stay here!!!!! We ended up staying here after our flight got cancelled and Southwest Airlines had a discount for this hotel. Southwest had a guaranteed rate with this hotel and the man James at front desk took advantage of the situation and tried to get us to pay substantially more then negotiated airline rate. Once we agreed to higher rate and got our room, the ac in the room is on opposite side and does not cool. Additionally, very low water pressure in the shower. Next day, we ask the front desk if they could call us a taxi, front desk says they normally don't call taxis. After asking multiple times, they finally do but can't give an estimate when taxi will arrive. After waiting outside for 35 minutes, I decided to ask the valet guy Nick if he could call again for me. Nick starts calling then sees a customer waiting for their car and hangs up to service the other customer. I had told Nick that I was going to miss my flight and really needed a cab to get to the airport. He didn't seem to care at all. He completely ignored me and proceeded to help the client waiting for his car even though I was there first. Worst hotel near Vegas! Very ghetto ambiance; gross food and worst customer service I've seen in a long time. DO NOT STAY HERE!"}
{"text":"CASINO: This casino is about 3-4 mintues from my house so as you can imagine this is the casino we frequent most often. They have beautiful artwork here (same guy that does the glass @ the Bellagio does it here but you cant take pics of it b/c they think ur cheating somehow? There goes a star!  ENTERTAINMENT: This is a pretty big place and it has within it a daycare, movie theatre, bowling alley, and Club Madrid that never has a cover charge and has weekly night live bands. I saw Nawgahyde here which was awesome (almost as good as the 80s tribute bands @ Fortune Casino on Racetrack)  RESTAURANTS:   hooters: u already know them  Guadalajara Bar & Grill: the best mex. restaurant you've probably never been to. I'd been to Sunset about 50x before I ate here and boy was I wow'd. See my review for them separately under the rest. name. I went here to celebrate my 1st A in Anatomy & Physiology. TIP: order the Cadillac Marg. its worth it for the extra $3. Dont go for quantity go for quality. and be sure to try all the salsas available.  viva salsa: my bf liked it. fast food type- order @ the window & eat in the courtyard  Oyster Bar: had a great caesar salad here but dont get shrimp - its that nasty $4.00 big bag of the tinest pink shrimp uve ever seen. nasty. better to get the chowder.  Italian place & wine cellar place - never had it either one COCO'S: Great breakfast. WAAAAY BETTER THAN IHOP & DENNY'S COMBINED.  i liked it better than omlet house b/c it has a healthy fare section w/ dishes under 500 calories!  Subway: brand new - they closed the quiznos for this - smart move! Panda Express: standard fare Fatburger: it was good the 1st time I had it but 2nd time just too greasy for my taste Sbarro: standard fare - just not my deal  The Feast: This is where I spent my Thanksgiving in line for a . long. time. Didnt have a watch but it was worth it once we got in. The 2 of us ate thanksgiving w/ no left overs to tempt me - and it was delicious. they even had menudo! Desserts werent great i'll admit- only the pumpkin pie was worth more than 1 bite. This place was almost as good as the Orleans... almost. I'd defintely go back provided I went jogging earlier that day. for a few hrs!"}
{"text":"try the buffet lunch here, all basic stuffs, except the Chinese cooking station which you can pick your choice of vegetables, meat and sauce and they'll stir fry for you.."}
{"text":"This place is great. The room was beautiful we stayed in the mini suite which we will be back because we like to come to Lake Mead and stay here. The movie theater here is amazing. The restaurants hummmmm The café had great breakfast food. Went to the Italian restaurant for dinner and we were not very pleased with the food that came out. The waitress did make good on our bill for us which is great. We will give it one more shot. But other than that we had such a great time at that casino. Could do without the smell of the smoke it is a little plangent in there."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, clean, and convenient if you need to stay in Henderson. The casino is conveniently located on first floor and there are a couple quick and cheap food choices, definitely not foodie cuisine but it's convenient. There is a Starbucks on site as well.   Unfortunately we did have some money come up missing in our room that we are waiting for a resolution about. We reported to security and they responded quickly to come take a report and we are hopeful we will hear back soon about it.  Otherwise, it's a decent place to stay. They have a nice pool although we did not get a chance to use it."}
{"text":"This was the first time eating at this buffet and exploring this casino. The casino itself is really nice I didn't know what to expect but to be honest it's one of the nicest station casinos I've been to.   The food at the buffet was pretty good, the Service was good as well, my server kept my drinks coming and kept taking the plates I was emptying and was very respectful, and had a great attitude.  As far as the gaming part of it I actually did quite well, the machines I played on kept me playing. and scored a nice bonus win on one of the older machines.  Overall my experience at this casino was really good, I will probably find myself coming back to this place in the near future."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Checked in and the room was dark with worn/dirty furnishings - and this was an upgrade to a junior suite.  Barely any lights in the room so couldn't see much which was probably better because room did not look that clean.  Went to front desk to try and switch rooms.  guy at front desk was full of excuses why he couldn't switch me to a cleaner room that didn't have dirty carpets, stains on sofa, wallpaper coming off wall, etc.  If this is local's casino, they locals can keep it.  No thanks.  Workout room which is covered by amenity fee had 2 treadmills and some toher equpment for a ton of rooms.  Also, on of the treadmills didn't even work.  Glad I paid $14.95 a day for that."}
{"text":"I spent the week reviewing the station casinos and this was absolutely the worst of the bunch. Actually, the worst hotel in the Vegas area I have been to. The girl at the desk was nice but management seemed overwhelmed and rude. Go anywhere but here"}
{"text":"Stayed here for a 3 day weekend baseball tournament with my sons team. Check in was fairly stress free process. Getting our stuff to the room was little hassle as the hotel is a walk from the front desk. However if you park next to the hotel entrance, there's no ramp to roll your luggage. You have to present your key to the security guard to enter the hotel & use the key to activate t he elevators. The room was decent, a little outdated & stale smelling. Housekeeping was awesome thought kept the room stocked & clean.  This hit is super kid friendly. Bowling alley had glow in the dark bowling on the weekends & the kids loved it. Movie theatre was over priced. Kidquest childcare $9/hr was super convenient with the Mouse maze & games. Kids if all ages found something to do. And parents could hangout til 2 am. There were a lot of dining options from Sbarros, Subway, chinesefood, Ben & berets, oyster bar, Italian sitdown, buffet, Starbucks, etc. Staff was friendly. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've never stayed in the hotel but visit the casino every other time I visit Las Vegas.  I like the atmosphere and parking arrangement.  I like the dinner buffet (that used to be even better - but that's how everything goes these days).  I like that I'm usually at least a little lucky here.  I really should try staying here since it is in a decent neighborhood with lots to do (and Gen Korean BBQ across the street)."}
{"text":"It's geared towards and older crowd or a \"family friendly casino\"  there is a bowling alley and a food court and a children's play area. It's like a corner of its a mall and the other end cheap dining plus casino.it was okay I probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"JUST LOVE THIS CASINO.  MY FAVORITE PLACE out of all the other casinos around.  It's nice not having to go to the strip and be amongst all the tourists."}
{"text":"Pricing was very misleading everything was extra they charge $50-$75 a day for use of the exercise room and pool even if that doesn't interest you nothing is disclosed until after check in I would not recommend this hotel for anyone services adequate but management lacks integrity"}
{"text":"Poor service. Period. Stayed here because my work selected it for my business trip. Was the only one in line to check in. The one free available agent took forever to even look up and acknowledge me. My keys stopped working twice during my four night stay. No apologies no nothing. I had my hands full of stuff and stayed on the 20th floor. No way was I going to make the mile hike to the front rude desk. On top of that, you need your key to access the elevator and I was looking like a fool with hands full trying to get up to my floor. I had to wait for others to use their key so I can enter my floor number."}
{"text":"After countless check ins on and off yelp, I can't believe I've never wrote a review for this casino. Upon moving to the Henderson area living seconds from Sam Boyd Stadium (stalk me, I dare you) this is my casino of choice because it's conviently located close to home. No that's not why because Cannery is not too far and I rarely go there. Maybe because they offer paycheck bonanza and my work which used to be near here as well still printed checks and I would always come in hopes of winning paycheck bonanza. If you're wondering if I ever won, I didn't :( I don't think anyone ever did to be honest. I no longer cash my checks here (and it's not because I'm bitter about not winning paycheck bonanza) and we still come here. They don't have $5 movie Tuesday's but they have everything a local casino should including bingo and bowling and an awesome sorts book where I spent a lot of time making bets for the hubs during football season. Just don't leave without stopping at the Oyster Bar. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I like to partake in some gambling and eating in a place off the strip in Suburbia. Sometimes Vegas gets old and you need a change of pace in the area."}
{"text":"I had a really good stay. The food was really good. The staff was very friendly and helpful, very professional. I ended up staying another night, Ron from the front desk did a great job of explaining everything to me and really knew what he was doing. The bar tender remembered me everytime I went down. I had an emergency on the trip and manager Jorge went above and beyond to help. I look forward to my next stay at Sunset Station!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in this place. I left an Ergo Carrier and a winter coat in the closet of our room. 2 hrs after we checked out, they were gone.   The moment I realized it, I called the hotel. They transferred me to a security guard who said he'd check and call me back. He never called me back. I called him and he quickly responded, \"it's gone.\" It's gone?! It honestly feels like you didn't even check.   The only people who could have had access to the room that quickly after we left was housekeeping or hotel staff so I asked if he'd check there. He said if it was yesterday, it's gone by now.    That's wrong.   Just because I left them doesn't make it right for hotel staff to take them. How would they be gone? I clearly remember the last place I left them. I'm disappointed at how the hotel is handling this situation.  My parents love staying here. They come often and this time bought rooms for everyone in the family to reunite. The hotel is nice and the rooms are affordable. Sadly, the costs of all 3 rooms combined was less than the ergo carrier and winter coat left behind."}
{"text":"Casino: We play here off and on a couple times a week and this place is horrible for gambling. We don't play slots we play video poker and keno. Their machines have been so tight the last 8 months its ridiculous. We play different machines and different hands to break it up and give it a chance but still nothing. My advice is don't waste your money here. Go down to Fremont street where the odds are more like 8 out of 10 times you'll win verses 0 out of 20 times you'll lose."}
{"text":"Away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip and Downtown casinos, Sunset Station is a nice change.  The Casino is cozy with an accommodating staff.  We also frequent their Feast Buffet and other restaurants, the Strike Zone Bowling facility, and Regal Theatre."}
{"text":"Ate (well tried) at buffet and it was the most disgusting food I have ever had.  I would rather eat at McDonalds and I don't like McDonalds. Save your money and spend it somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not a happy camper,got a free room comp, but got stuck with an ashtray fill room, aka a smoking room.. I don't smoke and do not appreciate the accommodation. If I wanted a non smoking room, I would have to upgrade. So sad I use to think highly of sunset station casino, but not anymore and would not recommend anyone to stay here. This is my first and last stay.. The room smells like an ash tray and also it is a handicap room, I do not need a chair inside the shower.. The dealer are not so friendly and never really spoke to pit boss, as he never came by to put my card in.. The bingo is ok, sometime really busy, hard to win... Most slot machines are tight. The grand cafe was not too slow with their service, which all grand cafe have been to, the service was slow, today food was promptly got order and came out sooner than expected, it taste ok. Plus there is a guard near the hotel elevator to make sure no criminal follow u to your room, only allowing hotel guest to advance to elevator.. No real view, just the parking lot."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price at this local buffet located here in Henderson. $6.99 plus I have a two for one. Suuuuuure I'll take it. The i way I look at it? Fast food drive or breakfast buffet with a lot to choose from ? Healthy or not, at least you have a choice. And yes there is an omelette station. Don't care much for meat so i can pick and choose what I want. Customer service is great. Don't forget to get your players card at the rewards center to get your discount before you go anywhere in the casino to do a purchase. It does help a lot. You also get great useful coupons via mail like free buffet and all kinds of deal. So chomp your way pips! Not bad. So why 3 stars? Because I don't want you comparing this local gem to the strip buffet. Besides Go station casino . You Rock!"}
{"text":"I really like the off-strip casinos and restaurants.  This place is no exception.  It's updated and clean, and best of all- not too crowded.  Mostly locals hit up spots like these.    The buffet was cheap and expansive... just the way I like them! hehe"}
{"text":"So not impressed!  Had to stay here because everywhere else in town was booked for the CES and the Miss America Pageant.  Big disappointment.....small rooms, casino was way smokier than most.  There were no deals at any of the cocktail lounges.  In fact, it was a sport just trying to get the attention of one of the so-called bartenders.  No personality at all.   Not one of them!  I did like the fact that you had to insert your room key into the elevator to get to your floor, because the place was crawling with vagrants, and I made sure there was nobody getting on the elevator with me.  Not in that bad of an area, but I still didn't feel all that safe.  The one and only saving grace was the Pasta Cucina restaurant.  Awesome food, service a little slow, but worth the wait.  And reasonable."}
{"text":"We stayed here this weekend with my son's baseball team. We reserved these rooms MONTH's ago. For anyone who travels with a larger group with kids especially you know the pool is key to entertaining the kids.    On the 2nd night of our stay after our boys played baseball all day 11am  - 6pm all we wanted to do was take them back to swim and relax.  The hotel had other plan for us. They had a concert being held at the hotel which closed the pool.  When I contacted the hotel manager and explained i had 13 very disappointing families she offered nothing for our families.  I mean seriously. This hotel was assigned to us by the tournament company. You would have thought they would have taken into consideration they were hosting several teams with kids and families. When I asked if she could offer us anything to help keep the kids occupied like token for the arcade or a round of bowling the manager just kept repeating \"we are not compensating people for the pool being closed\". To me that is ridiculous. you know you are hosting several teams with 13 plus families per team. You should have alerted us that the pool would be closed. That was one of our 3 nights there and our boys wanted to swim.  That is the only activity at the hotel that is free of charge.  Our team spent at least $6000 at your hotel with room and dining and you could not offer a round of bowling or some tokens for me to offer my 13 disappointed families?  Not to mention the families that could not fall asleep until after 11 when we had to be back to the fields at 8 am Sunday morning.  Also Sunday morning we woke up and our whole floor had not hot water.   Your manager needs to take a little lesson in customer service. You were willing to allow me to sign an agreement to say there and commit our fund to you but when it was not all we wanted it to be you offered us nothing, Shame on you!   We will be back to Vegas for many tournaments to come but we will NOT be at Sunset Stations."}
{"text":"Food is fair at best, even for the price.  Bowling alley isn't kept up and equipment frequently breaks down.  Gambling seems to be less gambling and more contributing.  Don't see too many winners here and our luck is much better at other places.  Sports book always has odds that are slightly worse for the gambler than other houses.  Its best attribute is location and the movie theatres which they don't run.  The reclining seats are great!!"}
{"text":"This place was great!!! I was there this past weekend and enjoyed every minute spent at the location. The buffet is awesome, affordable and delicious. We had a suite on the 8th floor, rm 827. Very affordable, great service, nice clean rooms. Will re visit in December!!! No 5 star rating because there was a convenience fee and it was not on the strip other than that a definite place to visit."}
{"text":"It doesn't smell like an ashtray so much like the other casinos in the area.  The Oyster Bar is nice but the waitress ignored us for 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Very nice comfy Hotel. Employees are super nice and helpful :) Food and service  at the Grand Café is good."}
{"text":"got  free 2 night  stay here and free slot tournament entry . the hotel is one of the older hotels , but if you get your rooms in the tower , it's still nice.  lots of different promotions and offers everyday to win all kind of things. it's also right across from galleria mall . very convenient .if you have a rental car and don't mind being away from the strip , this place is a good choice"}
{"text":"This review is just for the casino as I've never stayed the night here.  Having lived down the street from Sunset Station for 7 years, I was there quite often. It was my go-to place to gamble and see movies. I love that it's a little darker than other casinos and the dining there is amazing! I've only had great food at their restaurants.  They cater to locals which is a plus. It's always clean and smells nice. One of my favorite sports books in town! It's huge!!  Bartenders and cocktail waitresses are attentive and friendly.  I loved going here!"}
{"text":"This is no doubt one of my favorite places away from but still near Vegas. The atmosphere is inviting and even though it's not very close to the Vegas nightlife strip it's still fun! It's worth the drive and worth the money   From the tables to the slots they have the nicest employees! The drinks are wonderful and the gaming pays!!! I would and will definitely go more often. The rooms are also great for your buck! Clean and a hell of a deal if you're looking to get off the strip or over crowded areas of Vegas. Can't wait to go back. I'm giving 5 stars because there were zero issues with the casino, parking, games, rooms or anything that I encountered."}
{"text":"I totally love Station Casinos!  Bowling alley, movie theater, and gambling all in one place.  What a concept!   Sunset Station is in a great location surrounded by a ton of shopping so sometimes we find ourselves just stopping in.    We came by with my folks who were visiting and my mother, who will only gamble on ONE type of slot machine lol, stopped an employee to asked if they had any of this machine.  She went out of her way to walk my mother to the other side of the casino to the slot machine she was looking for.  Knowing that I was a local (my mother told her) she asked if she could sign my parents up for their own Boarding Passes so that I could get credit for it under mine. She took each of their ID's, walked away for less than 5 minutes, and came back with their cards.  That was really nice and I got extra points for them signing up...   The casino (and bathrooms) always seem clean, albeit a little smokey, so I knocked a star off for that.  But otherwise I really like visiting this place!"}
{"text":"One would think that there are only casinos on the Las Vegas Strip or Old Downtown Las Vegas. Guess again!!!!  There are several casinos outside these areas, but they aren't as \"spectacular\" in the typical \"LV scene\" as one might think. So all in all - not much to expect from here other than the gambling.  What has gotten worse about the casino is that it has gotten a bit \"cheese-y\" with the decor. It has no theme. In addition, the ventilation has gotten worse and you know how you walk into a Korean BBQ and smell like that after you've eaten there? Well once you walk through this casino for a good 5-10 minutes, your clothes will possibly smell like you've smoked a pack. Just sayin'.....................  **CONFESSION** I'm not much of a gambler. I'm even scared of loosing $1 on a slot machine! I always feel that if I'm going to spend $, I should benefit in some type of rewards wether it is in a form of retail therapy or indulging in meals. So I cannot attest to the casino level of Sunset Station nor the Hotel since I didn't stay here either. But I would imagine it would be a lot cheaper since you're not staying on the strip. You'd just pay for the commute.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So why am I writing a review about this place if I didn't spend the night here nor contribute any losses on the slot machines?  It's because if I'm in the area (Henderson) and visiting my grandmother, we would watch movies at their Regal Theaters. I can remember watching movies here since I was in elementary school. Yes the place is a bit dim, carpet sucks, bathroom needs an upgrade, but for some things that they have improved upon are the seats in the theaters and the screens.   Overall, you won't get the razzle-dazzle-ness from the typical casino, but you can watch a movie here in peace and serenity. Just be cautious you'll smell like cigarettes after you've watched a movie........"}
{"text":"This is a great hotel. They have an awesome pool. It is in a good location. The maids are always nice and clean the rooms well. The rooms are nice and comfortable. I have come here with my family 3 times and it has always been great."}
{"text":"I go here to Cash my paychecks and with most Station Casinos the Cashiers are friendly. The Valet's were friendly though over worked because they needed more of them. Having not been to the buffet in a while. It was good and they redone it. I recommend it to people. They have Gelato which i didnt try but the desserts were good. Bread Pudding was awesome."}
{"text":"This is a review of Coco's in the Sunset:..OMG just stay away. First you have to walk thru a smoke infested casino.  This is just a dated casino coffee shop, re-branded under the Coco's names. It's not been updated or cleaned since the casino was opened. Coco's menu nice with lots of selections, nothing complex as far as offerings. Service here it gets really good! Basically a non-inolved staff, just putting in time with an attitude. Clearly our waitress didn't want to be at work. Kept breezing by saying our order is due up any minute....Finally arrives 45 minutes after taking our order. Stated it just came up on the serving table. Order was cold, slab of curled swiss cheese on my omlet, cold toast. We just got up and left. Before we left asked to speak to manager...Ha...explained situtation to another wait staff member...she blantly stated they couldn't do anything thats just the way it is...Don't waste 1 hour of your life..lots of other choices in the area....give Marie Callendars a try, right down the street."}
{"text":"I came to the buffet for salad. They had spinach and good dressings.  I was pleased with my salad. Anything else on the buffet looked like it was 20 years old. Dry gross and gross.  However, the crowd didn't seem to be starving -- at all.  So no one missed a calorie and I guess all is well that ends well."}
{"text":"Parking is ample and the casino is well spaced out, a lot better than it's sister casino the station casino. They do have an oyster bar which I will try next time since they don't have lines like station casino. I was told by a player on the table that they use the same recipe and tastes the same without the long wait. The Casino has high ceilings and not smokey. It's a pretty big casino."}
{"text":"The Feast buffet is awesome.  The people who at the buffet move extremely slow!  Almost like they all are disengaged at their job!  The food is fresh and it's cooked well they earn the four stars on the food alone.  The food servers, cashiers, hostess and the food line cooks really suck."}
{"text":"We just got here for Valentine's Day, (2-14-17) we made the reservation over 30 days in advance and when we got here we didn't get the room we requested and then to make matters worse, the front desk isn't answering the phone. This place is really jerking us around, and we've only been here for less than one hour. It's 530 in the morning and I couldn't be more dissatisfied then I am right now.  What's probably the kicker with this BS we are dealing with is the fact that when we made the reservation the guy we spoke to on the phone was so nice that I actually called back to his corporate number to make sure his superiors knew what a great job he did getting us everything we wanted for this special occasion. We used the speaker phone and recorded every conversation we had, but we left that back at home and I will be updating this as the trip turns more into a nightmare or if they can magically turn it around and give us what we paid for and what we were told we were going to get.  Right now I would love to go down there and metaphorically punch somebody in the throat for this excruciating terrible experience thus far."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems..something here for the whole family and lots of entertainment. Movie theatres, bowling, arcade, and gambling for the adults. Lots of parking. Oyster bar is ok.  Almost feels like a big resort casino..but the workers treat you like a real high roller"}
{"text":"Best local casino by far! Sunset has everything from a bowling alley to bingo to a movie theater. The players club is also the best in the valley. They always have free slot play every month and sent great coupons in the mail. The casino is very clean and spacious.  The best secret are the late night specials (10pm on) at the cafe. You can get a full breakfast for 2.99!! The buffet is alright, but I'm not a huge fan of buffets. Sunset station is where the locals play, and for good reason."}
{"text":"I took my daughter for the buy 1 get 1 free buffet. I purchased it. the cashier asked the people behind us to go in front of me to the cashier,tried cutting in before they paid. I let the host know who is Rude. my daughter got the spaghetti and the noodles were Cold,the prime rib I got cut was luke warm,but we ate it and went to the gift shop,they gift shop is very nice,and we found earrings to match for under 20 bucks. Than I went to the taco place to get my brother a quesadilla to go,than we stopped at starbucks there, the cashier is Very Yound and RUDE as well (its so hard to find customer service in this town),and other customers need to learn to shut there Mouth and mind there own business quit Lieing. Security is very Unprofessional,and will call corporate on them also. BAD EXPERIENCE all the way around for being a Saturday night of what was suppose to be a fun night out!!! :("}
{"text":"We arrived at midnight and they had given our rooms away, that we had reserved! We were given alternative rooms with only 1 bed and a roll away that was horrible and lumpy! They did give us free buffet breakfast comps. My niece cut her foot with something in the pool. To top it off, on our way down to checkout the elevator stopped, we were stuck in elevator, called emergency button in elevator where we were put on hold!! Will never ever stay here again, absolute worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"I've stayed here several times and I really enjoy this Station Casino. My most recent stay was this past Sunday - 6/17/2012.  The restaurants are good and there is plenty of room in this casino. I agree with the other reviewers that the resort fee is a sham and they should either put into their room cost or tell you up front. I received offers for a \"free room\" only to be charged for things I didn't use.  Over the years I have had only one poor experience. I bought a soda on the 8th floor of the casino on my way to the pool. The people monitoring the pool refused to allow me to bring my soda into the pool area. I thought that this was a ridiculous policy and went to the front desk. The hotel manager confirmed that I would not be allowed to bring in the soda. He gave me $2 and said I would have to buy my soda from the machine at the pool. Huh? Of course the machine at the pool wouldn't take the dollars the manager had given me. However, I wasn't walking down to the front desk to complain about that.  I was also provided the number of the General Manager whom I could not reach and he did not return my call.  I understand not letting people bring their own alcohol into a pool area. Resorts need to make a buck too and it keeps the rowdies out. This was a diet freakin pepsi! bought from your hotel. Totally idiotic policy. With the people in charge of this casino making policies like that you wonder. Remember when the customer is always right was the norm. Not here at the Sunset."}
{"text":"Our usual Modus operandi is to stay off strip the first night of our Vegas trip.  We've stayed at the Sunset Station before quite a few years ago.  This is the third nicest of the Station hotels.  I like Red Rock over Green Valley Ranch but both are very nice.    The Sunset Station is a Three Diamond resort.  We opted for a King Suite since we were traveling with one of the Queen of Reseda's Daughters.  We had lot's of room.  The King Suite is very large.  Big living room with a dinning room table for four, a two sided granite wet bar with fridge.  King bed, gigantic bathroom with double sinks, walk in shower, and large bathtub with jets.   Total cost for a Saturday night in late August was $259.32.  I'd say it was worth it.  My only complaint was as soon as I hit the door upon check in, I cranked that A/C to the maximum and it ran until check out the next day and the room temp was a steady 74 to 73 degrees tops.  I like it cold in my room especially overnight.  A/C unit needs to be serviced.  The crowd was older folks but not too old.  I was originally going to take us off property to have sushi for dinner.  The taxi service is nonexistent, so we opted to eat at the Oyster Bar.  Score!  That place was great!     Went down in burning flames playing video poker.  Lost a bunch of $$$.  Drank a little too much.  Stayed out late.  VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Awesome hotel. I love it because I can leave my child at the kids quest hourly supervised daycare. Just bring shots records of your child. $9.50 hourly rate. You can leave kid at kid quest and leave premises. Limit 5 hours.   The room was super comfy. I loved it. King size bed yes!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of sunset station :) I have to admit I was a little sketchy on staying here for the first time.  But the rooms are pretty big :) I like that the sink area and the shower/toilet is seperated. The beds are nice as well :)  The negatives, the shower is not to my liking. I can see that they are using the shower heads that save on water usage, but it's set to low in the wall. I have a hard time trying to take a good shower :(  Also the toilet sounds like its going to suck you in when you flush haha :)  Another negative I saw was the lighting in the room. When I first walked in I turned on the light switchs next to the door, and it only lit the bathroom area. And it was very dark in the bedroom side. Had to scrounge to find the lights for the bed area. 2 switches next to the bed, a lamp in between, and a lamp on the corner by the window. I think the lamp by the window should be connected to the light switch by the door. Or atleast have another light switch by the entrance into te bedroom to turn on some lighting.  Other the that it was great :) great facilitys like the bowling alley, the buffet, and the oyster bar just is the icing on the cake :)  Looking forward to staying here again in the near future :)"}
{"text":"I'm going with 4 Stars just to be a little conservative but we really enjoyed our stay here. We have stayed off the strip before but this was by far the best experience for several reasons.  The Vibe: I'll be completely honest...this is more of a baby boomer resort. We saw some younger patrons and some older, but not many. Most are age 50 to 70's. Many are locals who seem to spend time here because it is close to home. The buffet is popular with families on the weekends.   Resort Casino or Casino Resort: This is not just a Hotel with an attached  Casino. There is a Megaplex type movie theater, a huge bowling alley, an outdoor amphitheater, indoor theater/music venue, a 24 hour restaurant, an AYCE buffet and several restaurants including Italian and a fancy steak house. Live entertainment events seem to be on Friday and Saturdays. Name entertainment is brought in a couple of times a month. Some of the upcoming acts are ones that I would love to go see.  Casino: Large Sports Book room, lots of slot machines plus video poker machines, including progressive machines. Gaming tables are minimal and there are no roulette machines that I noticed. What I liked was the fact that that many of the machines were simple old school games with frequent payouts. We played mostly the old school machines following a system that has proven to be lucky for us. We gambled every night and won every night except for one where we broke even. But even if we hadn't won, what is important is to have a good time playing. I can confidently report this was the most fun that we had gambling in a long time. There is bingo, a players card system for earning and spending points. There is no active poker room that I could see. Although I think they do have poker events.  Restaurants: We ate 3 times at the \"Feast Buffet\" and twice at the 24 hour restaurant. Neither were world class but they were good enough and low cost and when you want to eat at 3am it is there waiting for you. There are a number of fast food places scattered around the casino and we tried some of these too but they are not open all night.  We went to see a movie too and went and watched people bowling a couple of times.  Rooms: Hotel rooms have been updated and are nice and comfortable and are priced for value. We liked our room and the extra security provided near the elevators.  Parking is free. Customer service is great.  Other: Close to the airport with easy access to freeways and the rental car return. There is a huge shopping mall right across the street with other restaurants and a foodcourt. The LV Strip is not far away and we went there to enjoy the Bellagio and the Venetian and the Aria complexes and restaurants."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for many reasons. Its a beautiful neighborhood, not too busy, & close to everything. Close distance to the 95 and 23815am freeway as well. They are just about an all In one casino. Nice bowling alley with cheap games during the week and moonlight bowling on weekends. 2 pool tables are also available in the alley, and an arcade with air hockey, racing, phototbooth, etc, which is a plus for me and my boyfriend. Three things we love in one part of the  location. On top of that they have a nice sports book, a bit busy on sunday but the players club den is open which is perfect. Players club consists of three huge tvs and five large ones straight ahead of seatibg, which allows you to watch multiple games at once without being far away or looking up. There are booths, or tables to choose from and you can upgrade to comfy recliners in the front. Though initially it is free to get it and you dont need to purchase anything, there is a waitress available for drinks and food service buffet style on the side. They have a 24hrs cafe with delicious spicy wings, & eggs Benedict but not many other options for people who dont eat dairy like us. There are quite a few restaurants to choose from though ranging from high to low pricing. The buffet is my least favorite aspect of the casino. Horrible for us with food options, just about everything has dairy and many things pork & beef. The price was super xheap though. $9.99 each for dinner and they sent me coupons in the mail buy one get one free. So even though we didnt enjoy the food we were glad it cost us only $5 each to eat. There is a 24hr subway as well. Though some workers there take produce off of a sandwich they put on by mistake and back into the containers. I was getting a veggie aub and had to have them change the spinach bc it was just on someones else sandwich full of cheese which i dont eat. They thought i was crazy for saying something. Also there's a movie theater but man the tickets are $15 a person!  Way to high but matinee hours I beleive they are $6. There's always a plus to the minus here. Employees are usually pleasant, though some working in the sports book are dingy when it comes to sports. Overall a great place I come here all the time. The weather is beautiful for a perfect bike ride here since I live close, and conveniently there's a bike rack outside right by the bowling alley."}
{"text":"Terrible tables here and the black Jack dealer dawn gave me such a terrible service and personality was horrible... I was sitting there with my wife and trying to joke or ha e a good time and down the dealer was so rude. I made a comment to my wife about a conversation we had earlier and then when I was talking back to dawn she butted in and said I do t wanna hear or listen to what you ha e to say since you talk to your wife like that or the comment I made to her? Wth? She doesn't even know the conversation at all and barged in and gave me an attitude...  Made it very awkward and told her how long she worked there...  She said 19 yrs... Then I asked if she likes it to lighten the mood then she said...  Not really since she has been stuck at these tables all this time...  Omg and then I colored up and then left.  Terrible attitude for a dealer and this place is a joke for a Saturday night too"}
{"text":"Really good food and food is really fresh. Nice dinner chill place. Server really attended on serving you. I recommend this place for good food and preice."}
{"text":"I come to this casino maybe two or three times a year. It's a Station casino so it is set up like all the other Station casinos in town. The one thing I don't like about this casino is the cigerette smell. Ugh! I don't gamble near people who are smoking but I still leave the casino smelling like an ashtray. I think I might just be overly sensitive to the smell.  On my last visit here, I noticed that the slot machines were very loose... or I was just having really good luck which I hope continues."}
{"text":"Dinner here tonight at The Feast Buffet was a joke...Server was slow as hell I know its 5 of us keep the refills coming not 1 every 15 min....Our server jose did more fist bumpin' with the homies that work here than anything.   REALLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Very attentive staff. Friendly staff. Buffer worth it and not so expensive as the strip pricing. Didn't stay here, but wish I had. Will next time."}
{"text":"Inside is nice, but the hotel itself is really lacking in the main rooms. Water in the shower is atrocious. The shower heads remind me of a broken garden hose from my teenage years.   The tub itself is rusting... so that's lovely.   Buffet was cold.   It's 90 degrees in May, and the pool is closed at 6pm.   Are they trying to take away all the fun stuff to do?"}
{"text":"Staying at the Sunset for a few days during Thanksgiving & again at Christmas because it's the closest one to family. We are staying for 3 nights. We called Registration directly and got pretty much the same price I saw online from some of the discount apps.  We drove up and parked in the lane for hotel registration. I DID have the good price...Then my husband upgraded to a 'suite' so we could get a refrigerator and coffee pot. Still 1 room & 1 bath-but 2 sinks! Since when is that considered a 'suite'? At the extra cost of $35 per night. I'm glad because the walk from the front of the hotel entrance to the elevators to rooms is forever, then our room was at the end of a very long hall.   The room is normal for a casino. It is pretty large with a tv, table, arm chair and table and chair. The room seems clean. Just nothing special for the extra money.   The Sonoma Cellar is a nice restaurant we have gone to a number of times. It has very good food though the price is higher as well. There is an Oyster Bar that is pretty good although the Palace Station is much better for gumbo. The Pasta Cucina looks good and the Grand Cafe has a decent menu. The Viva Salsa Mexican restaurant doesn't look like somewhere I would want to go except maybe for a snack. There is also a Buffet but we have had better at other casinos.   There is also a movie theater and small food court with a Panda Express, a Fat Burger, a Pizza Forte, Ben & Jerry's and a Starbucks. Gives you some cheaper options.   I guess as I'm writing this I'm saying the Station Hotel & Casino is an ok place to stay. Just nothing to make me choose it next time over any other casino either."}
{"text":"My 3rd fav LOCAL casino/hotel in Vegas.. Decent buffet. Pro Tip: Come to the buffet between 10:30-10:45.. You can get the omelet bar, and also the taco station when they switch to lunch at 11!!   They have great, corny, funny, fun cover bands on Friday and Saturday nights in their concert/club area. You can dance, drink, and people watch(some of the best people watching in Vegas outside of Ellis Island, haha).. It's even dark enough in there to nibble on your gal's ear in private. Booths AND sitting/standing tables..  Their slot machine selection is up to date with everything from Willy Wonka to Game of Thrones. Good table games, and a great arcade/Professional level bowling alley.   Their 24 hour Station Casino-staple Cafe, is serving pretty decent food of all ethnicities, with some late night specials to boot.  My only 2 gripes are: I wish they had the same good court selection as Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock.. Also, some areas can be a little too smokey for us non cancer stick connoisseur's."}
{"text":"It's close to home, it has food, gaming and movies. Yeah, we go here to rock our socks from time to time. Its nothing special when it comes to Las Vegas Casinos. Nothing fancy or shiny. Its like an old car, still works, still gets the job done without all the bells and whistles.   They have a lot to do and plenty of places to eat. We often stop for icecream or a Fat burger. We usually always go to the movies at their regal cinemas as well.   Sunset Station to me is like the weird friend you had in high school that you wish no one knew you hung out with from time to time...especially since you enjoy your time together. Yeah, thats how I feel about Sunset Station. Hahaha"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Sunset Station. There are times that we have had an excellent stay and other times where employees have pissed me off with their shitty attitudes or questionable behavior. The hotel and casino as a whole does impress me. For every shitty asshole employee, there are ten others who are fantastic and really enjoy their job and go out of their way to help you.   Although Sunset Station is one of many in the Station Casino group, I have to say that they're one of the best ones. For one thing, they have impeccable ventilation! I have been to others, like Boulder Station and swear that everywhere you turned, you were in a cloud of fog so thick that you could run your fingers through it like you're tripping off LSD! My eyes were burning, so bad, I could swear that I left there with an infection! To top it off, it was so old and that stench was just imbedded in everything. Thank goodness Sunset Station is not like that. I'm sure it's newer and it shows.   The facility is really big. They have the largest bowling facility in Vegas, a movie theater with luxury seating, and several places to eat. They have everything for every palate, like Sonoma Cellar Steakhouse, which serves steaks and seafood, Pasta Cucina, which serves all kinds of Italian dishes, Cabo, which has nasty ass Mexican food and service, The Oyster Bar, which serves seafood and New Orleans style food, and Viva Salsa, which is fast Mexican food and is better than Cabo, go figure...  There's also the Feast Buffet and 24-hour dining in the Grand Cafe. They also have a Subway, a pizza place, Panda Chinese food, and a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop. If you're staying in the hotel, you can also have food delivered.   They have several entertainment options, many of which play live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The Gaudi Bar, Club Madrid, and Rosalita's offer many choices, including watching live games or UFC fights.   If you are a guest in the hotel, you will find nice new renovated rooms that still smell new. Housekeeping is very accommodating and will bring extra blankets, towels or pillows if you need it. Your room comes with high speed internet and you also have the option to buy faster internet. You can also make unlimited local and domestic long distance calls, have gym access, have pool access (closed during winter months), two-for-one bowling, complimentary copy and fax services, and you also receive a 20% discount on gift shop purchases. They also have a computer where you can print your boarding pass if you happen to be flying out."}
{"text":"Lobby: Noisy, it contains a bunch of casinos and restaurants   Rooms: Super quiet and clean w/ a relatively modern vibe. We selected the \"Newly Remodeled Deluxe Room with King Bed or Two Queen Beds\" option, and opted for 2 Queen Beds (booking.com), for 2 nights (Wednesday & Thursday). Room had a flat screen tv, 2 beds, towels, and complimentary toiletries (body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and soap). The shower had a nice shower head- like rain drops but set to high pressure mode.   Prices: For both nights, we paid $119 total (taxes and resort fees included). Don't smoke in non-smoking rooms. The windows in the room do NOT open. There's also a clause in the document you sign upon check-in that says smoking will lead to an extra $200+ charge to your debit card. We didnt smoke in the room, didn't want to risk getting fined for it.   Also, I think they take another $100 deposit (upon check-in) that gets refunded within 30 days. I'm assuming that smoking would lead to that deposit not getting refunded + another $200 charge for violating terms and conditions   Check-In: Desk is located to the left of the grand entrance. Line was really short (2min wait time). The guy checking us in was very friendly, as were all the other employees at this hotel.   Room Service: Delicious! Got one of the pizzas, fries, and Chinese Chicken Salad. It came with a mini ketchup and Tabasco sauce bottles. Kept those as souvenirs   Dining: Fatburger, Starbucks, Feast Buffet, and more. The buffet had food that was actually really good. It wasn't drenched in oil and tasted fancy. Get a \"Boarding Pass\" before going to the buffet. It's located to the left of the buffet, is free to get, and provides a $1-2 discount on buffet meals.   Location: Suburban neighborhood, with lots of stores spaced out across giant parking lots. There's a Walmart Supercenter located 0.5 miles away from the hotel, so if you want to get drunk on a budget- stop by the Walmart. We bought several bottles of Barefoot Bubbly champagne (~$8.50/bottle) and Skyy vodka (~$11.50/bottle of fifth). One of the hotel's bars (closest to the entrance) serves $0.99 margaritas, so there's also that option. Can't really recommend that particular margarita though; if you're heading to the bar, get better drinks. The 99 cent margarita tasted like syrup (not in a good way), but 99 cents is 99 cents.   Overall, I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a hotel that offers:  -a great price  -quiet and nice looking rooms -lots of dining options (fatburger, starbucks, a buffet, etc)  Also, the ceiling on the 1st floor is painted to look like sky. It looks nice. The entire 1st floor has a lot of excellent spots for taking pics at."}
{"text":"Just two words...BED BUGS!!! I've had the same room within 3 weeks. On both occasions, the hotel claimed to have hired an exterminator and found no evidence of the little critters. I caught one, put it in a bag and asked a manager to call me. A month later, still no call. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I booked my hotel here to be closer to family, the price was reasonable but there were cheaper offers from nicer hotels on the strip. Anyway, I booked this on Expedia and they notified me they were charging me for the first night and when I checked in, the remainder would be billed to my CC. At check in, they told me another $100 plus 14.99 a day would so be billed and I'd receive my $100 at check out. I was not aware of this, but because I had no other choice I had to be okay with it. When I got to the room, there's no refrigerator, which was a HUGE disappointment, I have a 2 year old. All the food I brought had to be thrown out, had to put her juice on ice. The bucket is hardly big enough. We stayed on the 5th floor which is NON smoking, when multiple times we would walk out of the elevator and smell cigarette smoke.  I didn't bother with the buffet, as I've read horrible reviews. My room was never fully cleaned, the bathtub was disgusting, I had to clean it myself before giving my daughter a bath. If I could have check out early and received my full refund for the remainder days I would have and just crashed at my Dads. I won't ever stay here again, and I'll tell everyone I know not to either."}
{"text":"An older casino, Sunset Station is quite a ways off the strip and right under the flight path for McCarren airport (but they didn't tell me THAT) . . . nice restaurants and a decent theatre (very comfy recliner seats) . . . the casino smells bad (a combination of body odor and cigarettes) . . . the staff appears beleaguered at best (although the lady at the movie theater was cheerful and knowledgeable). It looks good from the outside."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas/ Henderson area. This place has a bowl alley , arcade and a movie theater for the kids. Room were very clean . Customer service was fantastic.  Sport book was a great place to kick off week 1 of Nfl season"}
{"text":"Off The Strip, very casual buffet, friendly service.  Kind of like Golden Corral, but slightly less varied in options...  Tasty enough entrees and sides though.  The desserts were so-so.  But it's cheap!  And our meals were free, thanks to myVegas Rewards.  So come by for lunch, if you're already in the area and have myVegas Rewards in hand."}
{"text":"Never stayed off the strip cause I didn't want to stay in a rundown smoke filled room.  This place was great.  Big enough hotel that you can do a lot of different things.  Got coupon book booking through Expedia.  Rooms were clean and nice.  Staff was helpful and my room did not smell like smoke. Id stay here again."}
{"text":"This casino is a bit ways from where my brother and sister live. So we only went to this casino once only because we went to the mall down the street and came here just so we can wait till traffic dies down. Anyways this casino is a bit small and had the feeling of an old casino not much of the hotel/casinos on the strip. I played a little bit of paigow here but didn't feel a bit comfortable playing their one bit. I wasn't too sure what it was but it just kept me from rating this well.  This casino did have a Kids Quest, but my son said it was small and boring compared to all the others he's been too. So I guess this isn't the place to take your kids if you had a choice."}
{"text":"So I went here yesterday for the first time (1/15/11) with my family. The parking was a breeze, we were pretty close to the entrance. When we walked in, it smelled funky - like stale booze.  Signed up for the \"boarding pass\" so I could get a discount on dinner. That was easy and I like that they give discounts. I got $3 worth of free slot play, which was something I had never done before. You have to put in a $1 to play and I ended up winning $1.75. Ha."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and clean and friendly environment you definitely have to hit up the buffet favorite thing about this place can't get enough lol!!"}
{"text":"We planned on staying here just to enjoy the pool, but it was closed due to \"high winds\" which were not evident outside or in the forcast. The front desk staff would not refund our money and didn't offer anything in compensation. Very frustrated. Used to love this place."}
{"text":"Oh wow! I was so happy to go here after so many years! The Oyster Bar started the evening out on a good note. The food was outstanding.  My friend ordered oysters on the half shell, which came out pretty quick, but for entrees we ordered Crab Gumbo and Red/Beans and rice. Which took a good thirty minutes to be served. I'm ok with waiting. The results of the night...heaven in our mouths! the Crab Gumbo was more than excellent(17.00) and he almost lost his mind with the Red/Beans and rice! We ate for another hour, yes it takes that long to finish the extra large portions!  Off to the movie theater. Um ok, you can recline and take your shoes off(I did) and watch a good flick. Almost like being at home. Great movie experience, not too crowded, very clean and everyone was very respectful during the flick.  Love my latest experience here.  Definite local place to hang out. Good food, great entertainment and no hassle!"}
{"text":"My Boyfriend & I Went To The Buffet To Celebrate Our Anniversary & We Decided To Stay For A Little While &  Play On The Slot Machines. I Guess It Was Our Lucky Day We Both WON ! As We Were Cashing Out An Elderly Lady Took Off With Our Ticket. (Literally Cashed It In Less Then 2 Minutes) We Contacted Security Right Away, Thankfully Angelo & His Security Crew Who Acted Right Angelo Personally Found The Lady Who Stole Our Ticket & Made Her Return Our Money. So We Want To Say Thank You Angelo For  Being So Nice. I Really Hope His Manager (Or Who Ever Is Above Him) Sees This Because He Was Absolutely Amazing. Sunset Station Is Lucky Yo Have Such A GREAT Employee!!!  (He Wouldn't Accept A Tip) So If Anyone Knows A Number I Can Call To Let Them Know What A Amazing Job He Did Please Let Me Know.  People Like Him Need To Be Recognized."}
{"text":"This casino has some things going for it:  It's a casino, they have relatively clean bathrooms, the guys at the craps table were nice and explained everything to my daughter who was there for the first time.    Unfortunately, they also have Loretta.  Loretta has worked at the casino for 10 years and she apparently hates her job (when you ask if she likes it, she looks at you like you have maggots coming out of your forehead).  Loretta deals blackjack with the cards face down.  The rules of this aren't like the rules at other tables where you hit the table to get another card.  If you don't know this instinctively, Loretta will yell at you, as an older septuagenarian sitting next to me soon learned.  My daughter, who was gambling for the first time after just turning 21, was going to hit her 16 when Loretta was showing a 15.  I told her quickly not to and she changed her mind before Loretta gave her the card.  Loretta responded to this by accusing me of seeing her card or cheating (which I had not and could not have).  Loretta is a mean spirited, nasty person who makes other people miserable and turns what is supposed to be a fun night out into a nightmare.  Put her out of her misery, Sunset Station."}
{"text":"Service and food were average. Liked the salad. Price not bad with their casino card. Green valley is better. Only coming back if sister insists."}
{"text":"Lovely hotel. Everything was big and clean. The staff was friendly and everything was done right.   There was ample parking.   We enjoyed our dinner and lunch buffet there. I was comped for a dinner after playing blackjack for just an hour at $5. a hand.   We will stay there again and think that it is a good place to stay."}
{"text":"I love this hotel and casino! The Station Casinos brand is geared towards locals and they do a great job of taking care of us. I love cashing my check here I'm getting a free drink or free food out of the deal. The buffet is pretty good for the price, there's a good Italian restaurant, Mexican place, steakhouse, and oyster bar.I always enjoy the table gaMes and nickel video gaMes too.  They have kids quest dAycare too and a  awesome arcade and theater."}
{"text":"Even though Sunset station has very bad air ventilation in their casino area I was able to win without playing at the Wynn haha lol. Also upon on checking out the 4 days resort fee was credited back to my credit card which was a big plus. Sunset station casino don't have the high end amenities like the Wynn but as long your winning and in a comfortable & safe environment that what counts."}
{"text":"When I visit Vegas I usually stay at my friends home which is located a few minutes from Sunset. One evening I didn't feel like hitting the strip so he suggested we go here instead to gamble a little and have dinner. I did not expect much when it came to the buffet and sunset managed to fulfill my low expectations. The food was on par with a lousy chinese buffet.   As for the staff at the casino, full of fking attitude. We sat at an empty BJ table, our dealer took his own sweet time as if we were doing him a favor by gambling there.Every time we lost a bet he would snatch the chips we lost in the most rude manner.   After that nonsense we switched tables and again our dealer dealt slow, then stopped dealing all together, even though we had placed our bets cuz he felt the need to have a conversation with his friend that stood right behind us and spoke quite loud. A few minutes later my buddy requests that he deals the cards, the douche dealer just glances at us takes his sweet time and slowly deals the cards while continuing to chat with his friend about some night they went clubbing together. I do not know why we stayed after that but instead of leaving we placed another bet well douche once again stops dealing the cards just to chat with his buddy, so I ask douche, are you here to deal or gossip with your friend, deal the cards. He told me to \"take it easy\" I told him to deal the fkn cards.  Mind you we were cool with everyone, never made a scene, we were not rude until we dealt with douche. ... I am not one to start shit unless I feel disrespected. The pit boss came by, so we told him what happened he told us this is a locals casino, and we cater to locals so we like to chat with our customers and if that means we take a little longer to deal cards, that is the way it is. I told him, so we have to wait 5 minutes in between each hand while the dealer reminisces about some club he and his friend (whom by the way is not betting) went to and talk shit about the girls they hit on,  he looked at the dealer, then looked at us and told us I think you guys are more suited to gamble on the strip.  F you Sunset, F you!"}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here! I didn't stay at the hotel but I wish I did instead of staying at Luxor (total dump). I was here for my very good friends wedding - I was a bridesmaid. After our bachelorette party the shuttle driver offered to give me a ride back to Luxor so I didn't need to call a cab. I wish I would have got his name - he was so thoughtful and kind. He totally took care of us :) the bartender (Sosa) at the Mexican cantina was very friendly and accommodating to me and my super drunk girlfriend (the bride). The cocktail waitress was bitchy and snotty but it's ok - some people are just haters and she's not worth another word soooo overall I had a super good experience!"}
{"text":"The hotel itself is nice. My best friend stayed in the king suite, we stayed in the Jr. Suite, and the rest of the wedding party stayed in regular rooms. After we all made reservations, we requested that they make note that we would rather have all the wedding party and guests stay on the same floor, and if that wasn't possible, just me be on the same floor as them (I was the matron of honor). My best friend had her wedding at Sunset Gardens and I guess you get a discount for staying at Sunset Station...so upon arrival, after we also requested early check in, we discovered that our rooms were not ready. We waited 2 hours and came back to find out we were all on different floors. We spoke to the manager, James, and he placed us all on the same floor immediately. Now those rooms had been clean and we didn't really have to wait but we did due to the front desk people not knowing what they were doing.  We get into the rooms. Spacious, clean, nice. The rooms were fine. No issues there. Though they only give 2/towels to the Jr. Suite so I requested more. This place has ample parking because it isn't on strip or technically even in Vegas.  Security is ridiculous, more security than on strip casino/hotels and they kept confronting us as though we were doing something wrong. Made us feel uncomfortable. The elevator kept deactivating our room cards so 1 week stay and 16 cards later....you get the picture. And you had to have a working card to get to your floor to get to your room. The one thing I did like was if you call front desk, they address you by your name, that was nice. The card dealers at the blackjack tables weren't friendly at all, tables close around 12-2am, something like that. Restaurants are horrible. Bad service and bad food. The keno girls in the cafe are so rude. This hotel/casino has shuttles but they don't shuttle to the strip or airport. Overall, this will be our first and last stay here. Not amazing."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, I was not impressed with check in with the woman that I got.  No personality or any kind of hospitality for being a guest!  Huge thumbs down when this is the very first thing you do.  I also had to ask her about parking and where to go because I just so happen to over hear the guy next to her explaining everything to the elderly couple next to me at check in.  The hotel room was really nice but the sliding closet door was broken and there were marks alongside the entry wall as well as major scuffs on the edges of column next to bathroom.  I only mention those details because you get charged a $100 incidental fee and we did none of those things, so not exactly sure how they go about deciding the specifics when it comes to incidentals.  Bed and pillows were comfortable, room temp was cozy (not too hot or cold) Our view was in a corner which over looked the highway and some scenery of Vegas but you could also see the balcony with all the vents and such as well.  Options inside hotel/casino were convenient if you like that kind of food, etc...Each time you come in to enter your room before you go to elevators you have to show your room card to the security.  It's a great safety precaution.  The pool is huge with a mini wave pool added, bathrooms available nearby, private rentals for your needs and a bar.  We loved our stay here aside from the not so warm welcome at the start, hence the 4 stars.  I'd book it again though.  My kids loved Vegas and the hotel stay."}
{"text":"The room was clean, the staff was courteous and the downstairs station cafe was great! We will definitely be going back - )"}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR DAY PASS AT POOL ONLY!  Only went because I can walk there from apartment.  Paid $10 to get in the pool for the day.  Attendant at pool door was very rude.  Almost yelling at me to go to the front desk and pay the $10 to get in, when the front desk said, \"nobodys really back there....go ahead and enjoy\".  2 lifeguards.  Cabanas for rent.  Outside walk-up bar.  1 Sprite cost me $7...might want to bring your own drinks amd snacks.  Pool is not deep.  Waist deep AT MOST, so that basically makes it a giant warm bathtub.  First amd last visit.  You would think they would let locals who live within a mile or two radius in for free.  Guess that would be asking too much from people.  Scam or be scammed."}
{"text":"Regarding THE BUFFET, I was impressed with it when I was there in November, therefore I made it a point to return. Boy, do I regret it. It was totally disappointing. The staff was not friendly, they actually had attitude...the food was horrible, and the presentation was horrible. It was sloppy and dirty. I spoke to a manager and complained about the guy at the carving station. When he finally decided to return to his station (from the back) he didnt utter a word and helped the lady behind me, when I was first in line. All of their attitudes suck, and they act as if they hate their jobs. NEWS FLASH: TO ALL BUFFET EMPLOYEES WORKING THE LINE...If customers like us dont frequent the buffet, you wouldnt have a job!!  something to think about! The only nice person I came across was Ray behind the dessert bar, he was friendly, and actually enjoyed his job. Ray you can do better than that, find another hotel/casino that will appreciate you!"}
{"text":"It's been 2 and a half hours after checking in to get a room and still waiting. The receptionist is not helpful at all. They have 2 receptionists. One comes and go. If not for my husband's high school reunion, I won't check in here anyway. Never had such a bad experience with Vegas hotels until today. Still no room by the way."}
{"text":"Nice Casino to hang out watch movies, bowl or grab some drinks. They have fast food restaurants and sit down restaurants (I haven't tried any of it yet)  This place is perfect if you're avoiding the strip and avoiding people who you don't want to be seen by. Sunset Hotel and Casino is nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Beautiful outside made me feel like a Queen! Buffet was way more than I had expected, it delivered every bit of my culinary desires and cravings. I just went crazy over the food! Don't hold me back, I want more!"}
{"text":"What a difference a year makes. Decided to go to the buffet tonight and get some \"we love locals\" service. The Feast Buffet was on par with a high school cafeteria. The staff were indifferent and no smiles. Our server had an argument with another server over whose section our table was in. It was not a bad thing as it was the only part of dinner that was not bland. The meat carver was having a discussion with one of the prep cooks on the prospects of their favorite college football team this year. He turned around to see a dozen people waiting for meat but turned back to his conversation and left us standing there. I can't comment on the rooms as I live here in Henderson now but I would much rather drive to any of the other buffets in Vegas where we get a locals discount."}
{"text":"Thanks to a seminar Husband was attending, we spent four nights here.  Hotel is definitely of 3-star quality.  Bathroom, towels, amenities...all 3-star.  Bed was comfortable enough.  TV worked.  Dislike:  when I asked for a refrigerator upon check-in was told we would have to upgrade to a \"petite suite\" for an extra $25 per night.  Uh, no thanks.  Meanwhile, friends were able to get one for $10 per night.  Didn't make us feel all squirmy good that we didn't get the ten dollar offer.  Another dislike:  our room was near the ice machine/vending machine room.  For three days of our stay the ice machine beeped non-stop.  After two days it was totally out of ice and still beeping.  Right before we left it stopped beeping.  We figured we were being punished for not upgrading to a petite suite for a fridge.  Oh well, who needs cold drinks, right?  Parking:  If you are staying in the hotel, park in H.  This means you get nice and close to the hotel.  But there are steps to lug luggage up to, and a clunky door.  Again, 3-star. But at least FREE parking.    Pool: At last I have free time at a \"resort\" and can actually utilize a pool and guess what?  It's not open on weekdays!  wtf?  Finally open on Friday and oops, closed for wind!  Saturday, open...finally got to peek at it, but  wah! didn't have time to hang out.  (looks nice enough for those of you that can actually utilize it)  Likes:  FOOD!  Restaurants are doing it right here.  Will review separately, but the cafe, Italian place and seafood all ROCK.  We avoided the buffet as the first words our friends said to us when we arrived were \"don't go to the buffet\".    Another like is the security.  They always have a security guard inside the hotel entrance and by the entrance to the pool.  You have to show your room key to get to the elevators and you have to use your room key to get up the elevators.  Kudos for security!  Casino:  sigh, I wanted to love it.  Did have some fun.  The obsession with the player's card and tracking gets really really old fast.  I'm just not that interesting.  Case in point:  four days of playing and buying things equaled a six dollar burger.  At one point I was informed by a pit boss that I had a duplicate card.  Uh, I didn't sign up twice.  Required dealing with the sign-up place again and made to feel slightly like a criminal when I hadn't friggin' done anything.    As for dealers and pit bosses, some were friendlier than others,but there wasn't an overall feeling of let's have fun (as I experienced later at other casinos).Machine-wise, they were generic, looked old, none of the gimmicky trendy machines we saw elsewhere.  Played some, nothing exciting.  Overall quite smoky.  There is a small area near the back that is \"smoke-free\".  And I do mean small.  Looked kinda like you were being punished if you wanted a smoke-free area.  Not to mention, machine choices are limited and certainly no table games.  In other words, stick with smoky.  Shop:  Had some time to kill.  Perused the shop.  Bought a cute top on the sale rack.  Fortunately I wore it one night while we were there, because now that I have come home and washed it, I can pass it on to a toddler as it shrunk ridiculously.  And the ring? Knew it was a cheap one, but expected it to last more than a month before tarnishing.  Movies:  Can't go to the pool?  Well there's a nice stadium-seating theater with current movies, one of which I enjoyed.  Also enjoyed a movie in the room at another time for about $11."}
{"text":"First impressions are key in any situation, and sadly our first impressions of Sunset Station were not good. We reserved a non-smoking room; however, the woman who checked us in insisted that we actually reserved a smoking room. Seeing as how we never reserve smoking rooms because we don't smoke, this did not sit well with us. However, rather than arguing with the woman, we just accepted the room.   The room smelt like someone smoked in it only a few seconds prior to us walking in. The bed was comfortable, the shower worked, and overall the room was clean, so at least there is that.   Funny story time. Whenever I stay in hotels, I usually get a midnight soda craving. I went to ten different floors of this hotel, and every single vending machine I came across was sold out of EVERYTHING. It's was a little unbelievable.   The hotel offers a lot of extra amenities, including a bowling alley, movie theater, a gym, and of course a pool. They also have a café that is open twenty-four hours, so if you're looking for something to eat but don't want to shell out the extra cash for room service, you're in luck. That being said, there are no refrigerators in the room, and I overheard that food is not allowed to be brought up to the rooms in general.      The hotel does offer added security for those staying in their rooms, in the form of a security guard in the lobby by the elevators. He checks hotel room keys, making sure no one is going up who is not staying there.   This place has its ups and downs, but if you're looking to have the Las Vegas experience without staying on the strip, this hotel is an option."}
