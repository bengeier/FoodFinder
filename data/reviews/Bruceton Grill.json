{"text":"Service was good, food was mediocre and a little pricey. I had the mild sausage sandwich which was $11.00 but it took half the hoagie roll before I got any sausage. It tasted decent but $6.00 or $7.00 worth at best!  My son had the boneless buffalo wings and he said they tasted decent but really tiny for the price. $1.00 per wing should have been .25c per wing for the size. The fries were lousy I will say that.  Quick service and our waitress came around just the right amount of times. Since it is new, we may try again in a few weeks to see if there were any improvements."}
{"text":"I really wanted something to succeed in this space. I love the big bar and atmosphere. The food was really surprisingly good. I had a burger that was awesome and a side of zucchini and summer squash that was very good and fresh. My big issue was the service. I sat at the bar and the bartender was AWFUL. My food came out and my empty beer glass was  sitting there on the edge. I got through almost my entire meal with nothing to drink. Every time I needed something it took forever. The guy beside me didn't have silverware for about the first 10 minutes of his meal!!! Hopefully they will get better or it will be another short-lived place."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time.  I should have taken a clue that no other tables were occupied.  The service was friendly, although they can only serve what comes out of the kitchen.  It took 2 hours and 20 minutes for one slider and greasy fries which I didn't even try.  Unfortunately, like several other venues that tried this spot, nothing lasts; however, there are great possibilities with an outdoor patio, better kitchen help and an organized wait staff..  Perhaps, this is the wrong location for this type of establishment."}
{"text":"Service was good. Wings were fried hours or even day before, so a little dry, sauce was ok. Avoid gyro and meatball hoagie. Waffle fries were missing..
.they were \"out\" but it reappeared moments later. It was first their week so i hope to visit again and see...taste the progress."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awful.  I went there with my wife and 2 sons for dinner on Sunday.  I don't even know where to start with this place...  Everything that we ordered was either undercooked or over cooked.   My wife and I each ordered a draft with our dinner which we had to ask twice for.  The fries were undercooked, burgers were raw, chicken Parmesan was burned, etc.  Price with a tip was $97.00 for the four of us.   We'll never go back, terrible experience.   Felt like I was having an out of body experience sitting in this place..   Really weird atmosphere, terrible service, etc..   Save your money and don't go to this place.   I was really hoping for a good place to go in this space.. Maybe the next one will be better."}
