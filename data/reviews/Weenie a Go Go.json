{"text":"Heard that Weenie A Go Go would be offering a Carolina Pulled Pork Dog. I got there about 11:45 am and was in luck. The pork had just finished it's 8 hour preparation. The pork had a nice tang. This weenie had the tangy pulled pork, a little bbq sauce, and was topped with cole slaw. What a treat!

I also tried for the first time a Mac the Dog. If it hadn't followed the pulled pork dog, it would have gotten more Press in this review.

As in other reviews, clean, fast, and FUN. I am still working my way through the menu. If not for the outrageous Rueben Dog and this Pulled Pork number, I would be closer to trying them all.

But if there is a featured dog, I won't pass it up!  These creations are incredible.

I wonder, What's next?"}
{"text":"The owner was very friendly but we were disappointed in the hotdogs. The hotdogs were very small and the bun was huge. We were looking forward to going there for dinner and were unfortunately let down! The atmosphere was cool and there were a lot of wild decorations."}
{"text":"Nah.

The hot dog was good, but everything else wasn't.

Are you a vintage store? A garage sale? A hot dog shop? A kitsch museum? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.

The Chicago dog was good, but didn't have a poppyseed bun and was extremely overpriced. I'm a huge hot dog fan, but I just don't see why I should choose this place instead of just getting an Atomic Dog at ABC or heading to Happy Dog. The hot dog itself was on par with a street vendor hot dog, which isn't a bad thing, but for $6 it is. The toppings and presentation only go so far."}
{"text":"Absolutely love these dogs I've been here on several occasions and have never been disappointed the all beef dogs are great I love the Chicago dog and picnic dog
I'm going to try every style dog they serve. This place has a great twist on a American favorite. The decor is amazing in itself I love the retro feel and furniture.
The staff is also amazing and one of a kind. Always a pleasure when I go. A++++"}
{"text":"To be reviewed it first requires a restaurant to be open for business.  I work in Ohio City and have walked down to try this place out every day this week.  They are closed on Monday which is fine and the hours the other weekdays are 11-6:00 which is kind of weird.  Are you a dinner place too or just lunch?  I would think 11-2 and 5:00-8 would be better hours but hey, I'm not in the restaurant business.  If the owner is on vacation, out sick ect it would be nice to have a sign on the door, a post on Facebook ect to let customers know when they'll be back. I can't imagine this place makes it very long with the hours they keep. I hope to visit soon and actually get to eat and will adjust my rating and review at that time."}
{"text":"Landlord interference  is why they shut down. 
Hope they will reopen in a better location"}
{"text":"Weenie A Go Go is a wonderful place to enjoy a true gourmet experience.  From the many specialty hot dogs to each of the hand made special recipe sudes and garnish. Owner chef, Jessica Johnson makes her own EVERYTHING - relish, mac n cheese, potato salad,  cole slaw, and on and on. Her weenies are provided by a local beef provider, her buns she gets from a bakery. You'll love it. My favorite is the Chicago Dog but I also like the Cleveland Dog. The decor is retro 50s and 60s. The music takes you back in time. And your hostess, Ms. Johnson is absolutely gorgeous.  Go there, have fun ..... it's everything you miss about yesterday."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style dog. But it feels like they overspent outfitting their space, forgot about poppyseed buns, and went ahead charging 2x what is reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was a retro paradise everything from my musical past on posters on the wall she even has vinal records she had large cookies for free the staff was very friendly just her and a gentleman and she is very easy on the eyes the hot dogs were Delicious but despite earlier review they are not quarter pound but that is negligible I had four types to go the Cleveland the dog of the day spicy local the go go and the slaw dog I highly recommend this shop let's keep her in business."}
