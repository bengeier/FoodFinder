{"text":"Wait time from order to food is ridiculous. Ordered at 7:30 haven't gotten the entree yet and it's 8:55!
I get acceptable waiting time and good food but this is unacceptable and the food isn't even good.

This is my first time and would definitely be my last.
Would not recommend this place to anyone. You're better going going to the Keg!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is attractive, high-end in appearance, but the sign of a badly run resto is a bad manager - in this case rude and arrogant. I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"This is our second try....really spotty service both times.  For the price of the food, the service does not meet expectations.  Maybe some better training for the wait staff and bus boys is in order."}
{"text":"What a great dinner!

So I'm a fan of The Keg and love their Prime Rib, so I had a benchmark that I had to compare to as we walked into the Stakeout Dining Room & Lounge.

Located on Main Street just as you enter Stouffville from the west, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall on the north side of the street. There is parking and there is outside seating if you want to enjoy dinner outside. The inside of the restaurant feels cozy and rich, dark colours, wood panelling, leather seats, like a steakhouse should feel! We felt a little underdressed in jeans and polo shirts, but we were welcomed warmly so it was nice that it didn't feel stuffy.

We were seated by the window in the relatively empty restaurant. There was a good range of big tables, tables tucked away in the corner for intimate meals. The chairs were big and comfy and all of the tables are already set with a cutlery, chargers, and wine glasses.The waitstaff was attentive and polite and in my opinion a little more formally uniformed than in other places that I've been. They came straight away with warm bread and an olive tapenade (yum!) and butter of course.

The prime rib dinner costs $21.95 for an 8 oz cut. This is a few dollars more than at The Keg, but I'd suggest that its a better value. The dinner came with a choice of salad as a starter (and it was a huge salad). I had a greek salad and it came with a lot of olives as well as a big hunk of feta, just like they do it in Greece, not just little crumbles.  The main (prime rib) was cooked to my preference drizzled in a gravy and with yorkshire pudding. The huge baked potato and a vegetables came on the separate plate, which I loved! The waitstaff came by with all the baked potato fixings, sour cream, bacon bits and green onions and will pile them on until you say stop. The wine list seemed extensive.

I'd suggest that if you didn't see something that you wanted on the menu, the staff would try their hardest to make it for you. Nice touch for sure!

There is a lounge/bar that is closed off from the main dining area that you can get to without going through the dining room. It seems like it would be an excellent place to hang out.

I bet it used to be a lot busier than it was on this Friday night. Too bad for the owners, but maybe good for the customers...a hidden restaurant that is a great go-to steak place that you'll be able to get great service and a table when you want it!"}
{"text":"i go here often with family and friends. decor is contemporary. big leather booths. big leather high back chairs. educated staff. amazing cook and big portions. expensive but worth the price. their steaks are cooked to perfection can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very old school fine dining with lots of oak and heavy curtains. The waiters are excellent. I had the prime rib dinner which came with a Yorkshire pudding, Caesar salad, choice of potato, and vegetables. I was absolutely stuffed. You definitely don't need an appetizer. It's worth getting the side of mushrooms if you like mushrooms - also delicious. Will definitely come here over the keg."}
{"text":"Good place quit and is good for families go there every weekend and love it so far, amazing staff and great table service."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant went there tonight for a friends birthday party.  The food and service was excellent.  The portions were great along with the atmosphere.  I had the prime rib and crime brûlée for desert. Give it a try.  Well worth it"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times now, the first time was with my wife, we decided to go out for a good meal and had heard a lot of good things about the place. The atmosphere is great and it is a true steakhouse with big comfy chairs big draperies hanging from the 12 foot ceilings to the floor. The service is impeccable and leave you feeling valued and appreciated which is nice when you are spending a few hundred dollars on a meal. It even comes with the authentic good fellas sitting in the corner discussing whatever business they need to discuss at 10.30PM - love it. 

As for the food; the taste is great, however both times I was there I didn't feel too hot afterwards, but I think it was the escargot that might have done it the first time and the second time it could have been the Caesar salad that came with the meal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but sadly it was not the case. I asked for a rare new york steak and it was kind of burned outside, that taste was terrible in my mouth, so I had to cut the outside and eat the meat inside. My husband got the salmon, it was good. 

The environment of the restaurant and the staff members are not welcoming. I was not comfortable at all.

I would prefer The Keg or Joey, both options are not really far from Stouffville."}
{"text":"Good quality steak, attentive staff.

I find the restaurant a little dark but that is the atmosphere they are going for.  That is just my personal preference. The tables are lighted enough for it to not impact your dinner.

The price, for a steakhouse, is very fair."}
{"text":"Came here for valentines day dinner. Ordered the following:
oysters for starters
Steak neptune
Rib steak

The oysters were a bit small. One order came with 6 oysters. Nothing spectacular about the oysters.

Rib steak was HUGE! Much bigger than expected. I ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.

My husband ordered steak neptune and he said it was PERFECT. Filet mignon topped with alaskan crab meat. He commented that he will never go back to the Keg after coming to Stakeout! 

The main course came with soup or salad, veggies and fries. We didn't even touch the side dishes because the main's portion is very generous.

Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with service and food last evening on a very hectic night. The appetizers were delicious (had king crab, wife had lobster bisque). Steaks were cooked to perfection. Considering our reservation was at 930 and we got seated at 10 (it's New Year's Eve) I think that was excellent. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, food and great customer service! It's on the pricier side but that's what fine dining is all about!"}
{"text":"Elegant interior with superb service. The food was fine however, I asked for a medium rare prime rib and it seemed like it was more medium. Loved the olive spread with the bread and butter. Would love to go back again since I believe in supporting local businesses. Note: It feels like you're in a fancy fine dining establishment. However there is no need to dress up. Casual attire is sufficient as long as it isn't ripped jeans and a tee...Unless you're Justin Bieber with the big bucks!  The parking area is shared with The Source and Popeye's next door."}
{"text":"FYI: It's a pricier joint. We came here for our anniversary dinner. Even though they seem to have a upper class venue, you don't need to suit up. Nice Decor and Romantic Atmosphere with the Dim Lighting. But location is situated beside \"The Source\" and in the same unit as A Taekwondo Studio and A Popeye Fried Chicken.

Gave us some free bread as well. With Butter and Olive Spread. Hubby loves Olives so he enjoyed the spread the most :)

We ordered:

App: Seared Bacon Wrapped Scallops. 
Was really tender and flavourful.

Main: Prime Rib And New York Striplion Steak

Prime Rib came with Garden Salad and Fries.
Hubby thought his Prime was not rare enough for him. Garden Salad was a nice presentation. Cucumber Ring Holding the Salad Inside. 

New York Striplion Steak 8oz 
Cooked to my liking and was tender and moist. Juicy and was delish. But the odd thing is my sides were all on a separate plate. Couldn't help but to put them all on 1 plate. Lol. My steak plate was empty with just a roasted bulb of garlic with it. 

Overall, food was great, service was great. Would come back to try others items next time."}
{"text":"Not worry the price. Decor is nice, food is not. Steaks just aren't worth it. Keg is better. Overpriced, no flavour."}
{"text":"Great place! There's Ruth's Chris for the downtown steak diner, and there's Stakeout for the uptown steak diner. Pretty similar in quality, and slightly less expensive than Ruth's. 

The food was amazing. The place was fairly empty when we went in, but the portions were good, and I got a steak for $28, but it came with soup or salad, and a side. Ruth's you pay $40 for just a steak, no sides, no appetizers.

I indulged with dessert after, and the creme brulee was real rich and creamy, and not just 1 inch deep, it was a good 2-3 inches deep. So well worth the money.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I must say this restaurant is fantastic. Over the years I have been here a handful of times and the food is excellent. The décor is very inviting, bathrooms very clean and the service is on point. If you have a group of ten or more they offer a fixed price on various menu choices. Check out the website. This would be a great place for a family get together or corporate event. 
I had prime rib with all the fixings/appetizer/dessert etc... excellent!!

Carnivores of all types will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great steak house at a very reasonable price. 
All their steaks come with: 
- Caesar salad or soup
- choice of potatoes: mashed, fries, or baked potatoes 
- side of seasonal vegetables

We went with another couple. My steak was cooked perfectly, exactly the way I liked it. The other three were happy with their steaks. My hubby had the porterhouse steak which was kinda smaller than I expected but steak was great. 
Overall, I would recommend this place: good service and great steaks"}
{"text":"Service is good. The steaks are very good. I ordered a rib steak and its one of the best steak I've had."}
{"text":"Not a very good bang for your buck. The steaks at the keg are far superior in my opinion."}
