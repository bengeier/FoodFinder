{"text":"I finally had a chance eat here again!  I had such good memories of my previous meal here... 15 years ago!  I wasn't disappointed. My husband and I shared a platter of assorted mezzes. Everything was very tasty. The rosé wine we drank with it was very good.  Definitely a nice prelude to a visit to Marché Jean Talon. Ah, Montréal, I miss you!  We will have to try Alep next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love the food at Le Petit Alep.  The ambiance is very nice as well.  There is a large variety of appetizers so go with friends to share.

Of course there's always a line-up for this place - even if you go at 6:30pm.  Try to get a table further into the restaurant as I once sat at the table near the door and not only was it chilly in the middle of dinner, but we would occasionally feel people stomping their feet as they entered the restaurant to shake the snow of their boots."}
{"text":"They had a fantastic wine selection as well as a very helpful and intelligent sommelier.  The hummus was a great pairing with excellent outdoor seating to enjoy a nice day."}
{"text":"From the service to the hummus, my friends and I fell in love with this place. We were unsure about wine selections and they have an in house wine specialist that helps you choose! So many options to chose from on the menu. There were 5 of us and we all got something different. It was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Two of us arrived around 7pm on a Tuesday night. We had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated, but we got a nice spot at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria. The price was extremely reasonable for the pitcher. The sangria was fairly good and not too strong. We got seated in the bar area along the window...it was nice and the waitstaff was very friendly. We ordered the mini falafel and hummus. They were the perfect size for trying a couple of dishes. However, the falafel seemed overdone and the mini pitas were served out of little plastic bags versus fresh, homemade pitas. We also ordered the lamb poutine, but we didn't love the flavor of the sauce."}
{"text":"Grosse déception ! Beaucoup d'attente pour des plats très décevants (salade sans sauce, riz semblable à un riz de cantine d'école, bouts d'oignons en surabondance...). Le Petit Alep n'a d'oriental que le nom car au niveau de la cuisine, on en est bien loin. Passez votre chemin !"}
{"text":"Le mouhamara, les pitas roulés (celui au filet mignon et celui au poulet), l'hummus, la salade fattouche et le labhné sont délicieux et les prix sont abordables.

Le resto ne prend pas les réservations. Par conséquent, les serveurs nous proposent de prendre un verre dans une section avec des tables surélevées en attendant que notre table soit prête.

Pour la nourriture, j'aurais mis 4 étoiles, mais le service est tellement inégal qu'il n'en mérite pas autant. Par exemple, à plusieurs reprises, des plats ont été oubliés et des erreurs sur nos factures ont été commises. 

C'est un endroit idéal pour souper entre amis, pour partager des plats et pour prendre un verre."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, and the ambiance of the Cafe - Le Petit Alep is fantastic (they also have a regular table-cloth tables restaurant open for dinners next door).

My favorite dish is the Chiche Kabab Terbialy - filet mignon on spicy pita bread.
The standard Syrian (or Lebanese?) dishes like Poulet Trator, Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, are always good.
And on weekday lunches, they have great specials too."}
{"text":"Best meal in Montreal- simple and good! Lots of veggie options as well."}
{"text":"The wait time is unpredictable. My last experience included a one hour wait for a table of four. 

They have a waiting area where they offer drinks. During the hour wait we had a chance to order wine with no follow up for additional drinks or appetizers. 

They explained the wait is normal. They apologized for the lack of initial service but did not offer anything to compensate for the poor experience. 

Food is very good but arm yourself with patience."}
{"text":"Superbe, bon, de la qualité. Parfait pour une soirée à 2 ou entre amis ! Les plats nous transportent au Proche-Orient, c'est aussi bon que là-bas! Dommage qu'on ne puisse pas réserver..."}
{"text":"L'ambiance générale reste tendance branchée-chic. La cuisine raffinée aux saveurs du Moyen-Orient permet de passer un bon moment. Le service est un peu lent, mais le savoir-faire des serveurs compense. Plus on est nombreux autour de la table, plus l'assiette se remplit de différents mets, tous plus colorés et appétissants. Les gourmands se régaleront de l'impressionante carte de desserts."}
{"text":"The Petit Alep is perhaps my favorite affordable tapas restaurant/cafe/wine bar in Montreal. Located a stones throw away from the famous Jean Talon fruit and vegetable market, this casual and hip yet inviting little Syrian restaurant offers a wide array of tastey snacks and delicious meals served in both small and medium sized portions, including amazing Hummus, roasted red pepper puree, Baba Ganoush, mouth watering Kebabs, lentil soup, falafels and many other Middle Eastern influenced specialties. if you ask nicely they can also bring you the menu from the more pricely adjacent sister restaurant Alep which shares the same kitchen, from which you can also order additional higher priced seletions such as amazing grilled shrimp and roasted lamb dishes.  The small outdoor terrace gets packed on most sunny days, and the inside is typically full on weekend evenings, so stop by at 3pm or 4pm during the week to get in with no wait at all. Excellent wines servred by the glass and bottle.  Nice service and a trendy hip clientelle of locals that know the food here is actually underpriced for the quality and size of the plates. Also very good for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Delicious food, extensive wine options, friendly service.

Pricey, $20 for the mezza platter. We ended up spending $80 for lunch for two with wine. Not sure I'd do that again.

Cheers~"}
{"text":"After walking around  Marche Jean Talon we asked a woman in a cookbook store located in the market a good place to have lunch and she recommended this place.  Another woman nearby overheard and agreed so off we went.  When we got to what we thought was the restaurant it was closed being it was a Sunday.  Confused we kept walking to find a new place and came across Le Petit Alep a few feet away which was open.  We hurriedly went in to escape the cold.

The menu is in French and we had a difficult time trying to decipher things so the host brought us Restaurant Alep's fancy menu book since it has English translations.  I got the chiche kabab plate which comes with salad, pita but not your regular pita drizzled with an orange oil.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender.  It was so good.  I want to go back but in a warmer month."}
{"text":"Une place pour manger une bonne moussaka avec votre pain  ou un kebbab, la terrasse est bruyante et passante ce qui est dommage. Vous pouvez aussi deguster un bon vin ce qui est un plus. Les prix sont tres accessibles et le service est souriant."}
{"text":"Le petit Alep est un super restaurant Arménien , authentique et goûteuse cette cuisine est riche et goûteuse pour un prix très correcte ! Nous en sommes à notre quatrième visite !"}
{"text":"I didn't think I was going to have a high-end Middle Eastern feed in Montreal-but here it was. Nothing wittly to say here. This place was absolutely great. I did the right thing and filled the table with Mezes, leaving the \"entree\" sized dishes alone. A big dose of Arak to wash it down..Nothing but great."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant (Syrien) dans une ambiance conviviale. Le menu dégustation (entrée et plat) pour 20$ vaut vraiment la peine. Il s'agit d'une sélection des meilleurs entrée et plats les plus demandés."}
{"text":"Consistently deliver great tasting, quality Syrian dishes, spot on service all in a fun and casual environment. Loved pretty much every dish I tried from the lamb, to be spicy filet mignon to the lentils and chicken. Fantastic quality-price."}
{"text":"Eh boboy.  Positivement. 

J'ai adoré ma visite au petit Alep par une soirée fraîche de novembre.  L'ambiance était agréable quoique la musique un peu étrange en fin de soirée..  Endroit réputé pour son ail et son vin. En effet, plein d'épices délicieuses vous feront vibrer le palais et apprécier la cuisine du petit frère du Alep (la porte a côté). Le menu se prête très bien au partage donc allez y avec la famille ou les amis proches puisque le piochage avec les mains et le double dip (d'hummus) sont à l'honneur. Le boeuf terriyaki est mon coup de coeur."}
{"text":"Slow, inattentive service. Average food. Contrary to other reviews, portions are not \"huge\". Mediocre restaurant, highly overhyped."}
{"text":"Friday night, 6:15 p.m., we arrive at Le Petit Alep. Take note of the address because I didn't find a sign, just the street number (191) above the door. We have about a 10-minute wait for a table, during which time we are offered drinks while standing at a little counter (the bar is set with place settings for dinner).

I am ravenously hungry (no lunch that day), but my husband has gone out for lunch plus we're eating earlier than usual, so we bypass the yummy-sounding tasting menu ($20 p.p. for two courses or $25 for three courses) and go straight to a main course. At our waitress' recommendation, we order the Chiche Kebab plate (spicy for me... Terbialy) plus a side of marinated vegetables.

A little basket of fresh mini-pita bread arrives, along with our vegetables: big chunks of carrot and white turnip, crisp and vinegary. They must do these in-house. Probably would have tasted better with our meal but I am too hungry to wait.

Our food arrives promptly, and resembles the pictures you can see here on Yelp -- a skewer of meat between halves of saucy pita bread, a portion of rice mixed with noodles and a lemony side salad. By eating at Le Petit instead of Alep we have 1 skewer of meat instead of 2, but at half the price, we're not complaining. The portion is a normal amount of food -- what I might eat at home rather than a ginormous restaurant portion. It is DELICIOUS.

For dessert we both try the Atayef, mine stuffed with walnuts and my husband's stuffed with ricotta cheese. His was better -- the creamy cheese cuts the sugary sweetness of the rosewater syrup. 

By the end of our meal, there is quite a crowd standing at the drinks counter...not sure whether folks are waiting for a table or just having an after-work drink. It is getting quite noisy, but in a \"this joint is hopping\" way.

In my opinion, the food prices were more than reasonable but drinks (especially the wine list) were more than I wanted to pay.

We're definitely going to be back, and next time I want to try the appetizers."}
{"text":"Une très belle soirée passée au Petit Alep après la découverte il y a quelques mois du restaurant Alep juste à côté. 
Ici l'ambiance est plus de type pub-brasserie, des plats plus simples, (pita roulé ou sandwich pita - mezzes à partager), une carte des boissons avec des bières de microbrasserie de saison. 
Les portions minis de mezzes sont idéales à partager en apéritif! De très bonnes saveurs. J'ai adorée ma pita aux falafels avec une salade d'accompagnement fraîche. 
Le service est très agréable, vraiment une bonne idée de restaurant avec une cuisine savoureuse et une ambiance sympathique."}
{"text":"Quel experience incroyable ! Le menu degustation a 28$ est parfait pour vous faire gouter tout les secrets de la gastronomie du moyen-orient ! Nous avons adoré le hummus maison et les crevettes cuites à la perfection ! De plus, le serveur etait trop gentil et il prenait le temps de bien nous expliquer tous les plats qui nous ont été servient ! 

Bref un 5 bien mérité!"}
{"text":"Just dined here with a colleague and loved it. A gentleman personally visited to discuss the wine list and the server explained everything on the menu in detail (all in French FYI). Our glasses were never empty and multiple quality checks were done.
Spicy ground beef plate was delicious and the salad du chèvre was a perfect taste combination. 
As a Torontonian foodie, I give this place two thumbs up."}
{"text":"As I was going to the marche Jean-talon, decided to stop by this restaurant to have a quick lunch. Arrived at 11h30, the place was relatively calm, but noted the place filled up quickly as lunch time is approaching. We were seated at their terrace. 
We were able to find free parking. 
The server was on top of his menu. We ordered the Poutine with braised lamb and asked his recommandation on few entrées to share. He brought the hoummous, mouhamara, 2 shrimps and sausages.
My favorite was the mouhamara!!! Made with 
bread crumbs, pomegranate molasse, and walnuts.
The taste was absolutely delicious. It was a nice finding. Portions were just perfect for 2 and we were quite full by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Location: Jean-Talon East, near the market. If you don't live in the area and need to use transit to get there, it's a bit of a trek. 

The place: The restaurant is of decent size, with inadequate lighting. I found it a little too dim, even though we went there in the middle of  sunny afternoon. Despite the funky art on the walls, I felt that the place lacked flavor - there was no real vibe happening. The art, however, was totally eclectic. 

The service: Good.  Our waitress was friendly and happily answered questions. 

The food: The menu offers a good variety of dishes that are a little more meat-centric than I like, but they also offer vegetarian options. I wasn't that hungry so went for the Falafel + tahini/herb sandwich. I thought this would be small, but the thing was huge and I definitely could have split this with someone. The Falafel was really good and the tahini/herbs added a lovely distinct flavor. The pita was soft, warm and fresh. My friend ordered a dish containing Armenian sausage, rice and salad and she loved it. We split an order of spicy fries as well but we were disappointed, as they weren't spicy at all. That said, they were pretty decent for a Lebanese place. Not greasy, with a nice crispiness to them. We both ordered the house lemonade which was actually a slush (would have been nice to know when ordering), but we weren't crazy about it. It was pretty darn tart and every time I took a sip, I couldn't prevent my face from contorting into what my friend described as photo-worthy expressions. 

Price: Fair. The sandwich was $5.25 and for the size of it, I thought I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"Après une dure journée à l'Otakuthon un ami nous a amené manger là. Il y a l'un à coté de l'autre Alep (le restaurant) et le petit Alep (le bistrot). Le cadre est sympa il y avait une exposition de photographies et les serveurs faisait bien leurs jobs.

La cuisine est vraiment bonne, j'ai pris des falafels qui étaient excellentes et j'ai pu goûter les plats de mes amis qui étaient tout aussi bon. 

En plat principal j'ai prit une poutine à l'agneau, délicieux, j'ai vraiment aimé, mais peut-être un peu trop de sauce à mon goût les frites baignaient complètement dedans.

Seul bémol, l'attente. En effet les deux restaurant partage la même cuisine. On a attendu l'entré presque 20 min. puis les plats 20 min après avoir été débarrassé des entrées. Soit le serveur est venu nous expliquer la raison (un groupe de 10-15 personnes qui ont pris priorité sur nous dans la partie restaurant) mais seulement après avoir vu qu'on commençais à s'impatienter après les entrées."}
{"text":"45mins wait for a table outside.

Food: okay
Service: friendly but ultimately bad-- screwed up one order, kept ignoring our empty water bottle, didn't chase away a bum in the outdoor seating area until after 5mins of begging for money (awkward!)
Ambience: Good.
Location: Great."}
{"text":"This place was jam packed!!!! The 15 minute wait to get seated made me wonder if anyone in Montreal ever cooks! It was tight and noisy, but some friends from Montreal recommended it, so we thought we'd try it out.

The Zatar mixed appetizer was a delicious start to our meal. I was grateful that we purchased the Petit hummus, which was the right size for two people to share. My roast lamb dish was fine, but not super spectacular and my wife really enjoyed her beef skewers. Service was a tad slow due to the high volume of customers, but they got to us enough (I just might have ordered another drink if they had come by some more). The cocktails are quite nice - we enjoyed our Manhattan and Old Fashioned.

All in all, I'm glad I tried it; not sure I'll be back (at least not during the dinner rush!). It's definitely a place where the locals go, so maybe I'll have to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Syria and Armenia. You won't find these countries in most of restaurants' lists, but their innovative flavors will definitely make you come back for more.

Le Petit Alep (The Little Alep), son of Le Grand Alep (it's neighbor) is more affordable and laid back than its daddy. Recognized as one of Montréal's best bistro, this hidden jewel is full of flavors, such as lamb, mantis (pastas stuffed with meat and nuts, served with cilandro and garlic yogurt), nuts crêpes, filet mignon and other deliciousness. For more happiness, share a couple of appetizers with your peeps, and you'll have a Syrian tapas evening. 

While you are there, why don't you go for a walk at the Marché Jean-Talon Jean-Talon Market)? Just an idea.

Closed on Sundays and Mondays."}
{"text":"They are really bad in service, I I wanted to have a dinner and they told me they have no table available and it will take forever to get one, \"REALLY\". I decided to leave after I came all the way from nuns island :(."}
{"text":"We were in the area around 10:30pm on Saturday night, and I used my Yelp app to find a nearby restaurant for a snack. Options were very limited but we came across a packed La Petit Alep.
 
It seems like this place takes typical Middle Eastern food and puts an interesting twist on them.
 
One of the dishes we ordered wasn't available, so here's what we had: 

1 small hummus: the \"complimentary bread\" here instead was a few packaged mini pitas, so we made use of those with this tasty hummus

1 falafel pita with green salad - looks like a quesadilla (in terms of 2 flat pitas being used, with stuffing inside), and instead of the traditional falafel that are spherical and crunchy on the outside, there was a falafel spread/stuffing inside. This was good but I missed the crispy falafel crunch. Salad was okay, there was a lot of it. 

1 side of fried pita with zaatar and cheese - this was like a Middle Eastern spin on nachos, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is a really good Syrian restaurant! Petit Alep is more modern, trendy than Alep. But... You can, and should ask for the Alep menu which is larger and more complete. I usually order the tasting menu and it's always great. You get to try about 10 different things in a few services.

They also have a fantastic wine list with a huge collection of private imports. Also, plenty of bio wine which is nice to try. Same taste, less sulfates, less hangover;) 

PS: I got horrible service the other day. Terrible. This dude was treating the place like a military cafeteria in the middle of a war zone. No friendly, not polite, and not attentive. I will of course go back, but never again in his section. Ouffff...."}
{"text":"Never had Syrian food before so I was pretty excited to try it out. Our server recommended we try the 3 course meal - everything was fresh, healthy and flavorful. The salad, hummus, shrimp and lamb were delicious. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préféré à Montréal, j'ai presque tout goûté sur le menu! Encore une fois j'habite à côté, c'est normal! Ce qui fait qu'on y revient si souvent: la bouffe est trop bonne et savoureuse. Il y a plein de petites entrées pas chers qui vont vous laisser de la place pour plus. Je vous recommande de partager un hummus et un mouhamara (le meilleur que j'ai mangé à vie) avec une salade fattouche, question de mettre un peu de légumes dans l'histoire! En repas principal, vous avez beaucoup de choix de l'assiète complète au sandwich qu'on accompagne de frites épicés (qu'on regrette de partager). Le menu permet de goûter à plusieurs plats et très facile de tout partager. Accomode les petits mangeurs avec des plats plus petits, moins chers. Vous pouvez aussi commander du menu du restaurant Alep (plus cher, mais plus raffiné et plus grande portion). Rendu au dessert, la facture monte, mais croyez-moi les desserts sont aussi savoureux: surtout la crêpe. Si vous aimez le miel, ricotta et noix vous ne serez pas deçu. Ce n'est pas l'endroit pour les amateurs de chocolat. Par ailleurs, un choix de vin incroyable ($$$) et plusieurs boissons originales (cocktail, mais aussi tisane). En résumé, niveaux nourriture aucune deception à ce jour. 

Niveau service, c'est variable, tu peux attendre longtemps si tu y vas un vendredi soir à 19h. Aucune réservation possible! Ca peut aussi être long pour être servis quand c'est plein et ils sont tellement occupés et sûre d'eux que le sourire n'est pas une priorité pour les serveurs. L'ambiance et le décors sont très chaleureux, ca compense pour le personnels plutôt froids et distants.

Côté pratique, il y a une terrasse l'été et on trouve du parking dans la rue. C'est fermé le dimanche et le lundi, et quelques périodes dans l'année. Si vous venez de loin, vérifier avant!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Amazing and caring staff. A+ service and delicious food. By far the best Syrian food in town. Have returned more than 10 times."}
{"text":"Après avoir testé Alep nous devions venir au petit Alep !
Et bien la cuisine est plus simple avec un style moins travaillé mais toujours aussi bon ! 
Il s'agit plus de sandwich pita, de pita grillé mais c'est toujours aussi bien assaisonné et on retrouve les saveurs de Alep. De la bonne cuisine :)
Attention cependant car il y a beaucoup de monde, n'hésitez pas à venir plus tôt et même si vous attendez vous pouvez aller au bar prendre à boire. La sélection du bar est bonne en bière (microbrasserie en pression ou bouteille), en cocktails et surtout en vin. En effet la cave est partagé avec Alep (tout comme la cuisine je suppose) donc vous aurez un choix considérable en terme de bouteille de vin !
C'est donc une réussite pour notre première visite :)"}
{"text":"One of very few chill patios on this section of Jean Talon (ok, pretty much the only one) and they win extra gold stars and bonus points for pouring very nice wines, strong cocktails, and serving up exceptionally tasty and affordable Syrian food. Petit Alep is a little more young and rock and roll than fine dining (go in the other door to grownup Alep for that). It's special and served with pride (and no reservations. Deal with it.) The sound inside is a little clattery and jumping', and personally I wouldn't show up here after 7 on a nice weather day because I don't love a line, but there is certainly lots to love about Petit Alep."}
{"text":"On l'appelle Le Petit Alep, mais ce restaurant chaleureux offre de grandes saveurs! Je vous recommande d'essayer le menu dégustation trois services (28$) afin de pouvoir goûter à une magnifique sélection de plats syriens et arméniens.  

Entre autre, cette option propose comme entrée du hummus et mouhamara, de la salade fattouche et et taboulé, du fromage Aleppo et des petites saucisses. Puis comme plats principaux, le fameux shish kebab terbialy (brochette de filet mignon épicé) et de l'agneau mariné - les deux sont excellents! 

Accompagnez le tout avec une bouteille de vin (la carte de vin est incroyable et très abordable), et vous serez comblés."}
{"text":"J'ai ADORÉ!!

Je vous suggère de demander le menu dégustation à 28$  pour goûter tous les secrets de la gastronomie du Moyen-Orient ! Mon coup de cur est le deuxième service, les crevettes sont folles ! De plus, le service était super! Notre serveur prenait le temps de bien nous expliquer tous les plats qui nous ont été servis ! 

Nous reviendrons essayer son plus grand frère le Alep!"}
{"text":"La Petit Alep is another restaurant that I've known about for ages but for some reason, I've never been. They're sister restaurant to next door neighbour Restaurant Alep but at a much more reachable price point. After trying to eat first at Trilogie but failing (they were randomly closed for a three day family vacation), we were trying to think of somewhere nearby to salvage our Tuesday lunch plans. LPA to the rescue.

Hours are great. Closed Sunday and Monday but every other day is 11:00am-11:00pm. A perfect spot to drop by before or after some JTM shopping. 

The inside is very eclectic. Love the use of bright colours and dark wood here. The place was packed for a Tuesday afternoon. Everyone was outside sitting on the terrace and basking in the sun. We got the next best thing - a table within reach of the terrace so we could at least feel the breeze. 

If you've never been to La Petit Alep, it's a mixture of Syrian and Armenian cuisine.

The menu has a huge selection: sandwich and plates options, soups, mezza, cheese plates, salads, grilled pitas and extras. On the back, desserts and your choice of juices, coffes and teas. I had to leave early but the fam jam got to try dessert! 

- Metabal ($3.50 mini) - grilled eggplant purée, tahini and garlic. Comes with a bag of mini pitas. So incredibly fresh and vibrant flavour. 
- Mouhamara ($3.75 mini)  - bread crumbs, pomegranate molasse and walnuts. Never had mouhamara before but it reminded me of a blend between roasted red pepper hummus and tomato paste. 
- Sabanegh ($4.25 mini)  - spinach, coriander, onion and spices. I'd eat spinach like this everyday if someone was making it this good! 

Love how they have the mini option available for all their mezzas. Perfect way to sample and share. 

- Fattouche ($12.00 large) - romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, grilled pita and garlic. This was light, refreshing and citrusy. Honestly, I feel like I'm eating so healthy every time we order fattouche. Great crunch from the grilled pita. 

- Falafel grilled pita ($8.50) - tahini and herbs. I wasn't expecting the falafel pita to be flat and stuffed inside like a pita sandwich. A nice change of pace from your usual falafelness. 

- Aleppo sausages platter ($12.75) - beef sausages with pine nuts. The sausage was a bit on the chewier side but grab two pieces of the pita and make it into a make do sandwich. The accompanying side salad is pretty plain. We added the leftovers to the fattouche. 

- Baked lamb platter ($16.25) - marinated baked lamb, rice and nuts. Lamb was moist, tender and flavourful. Love the use of nuts to give a bit of crunch to the dish. 

Happy I finally was able to try La Petit Alep. If you're looking for somewhere light and healthy to eat, this is it."}
{"text":"We had the 3 service menu de degustation for 23$ each. What a cheap deal to discover what Syrian cuisine have to offer! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time in this place and the last.. arrived at 8:45 and got our plate at 10:15. We ordered regular stuff and everything was so long to get! 2 beers,1small hummus, 1 chich taouk and 1 chich kebab .. 91$ WOW! Try SUMAC.. way better quality of food and better priced."}
{"text":"Meh. Pretty average mezze. Hummus, labneh, and moussaka were all fine but nothing special or anything to seek out.  The spicy beef pita we had was pretty good - similar to Turkish lamaçun. Spicy lamb sausages with pine nuts were good.  Bear in mind that the \"salad\" served with the entrees is simply plain escarole in vinaigrette. Overall we expected more -- fresher, better-executed, tastier.

I feel like this place is busier than it really deserves to be.  Server was distracted, brought the wrong check, and one of our mezze (pickled veg) was never delivered.  Overall service could have been better. Pretty middling experience, honestly.  The bread in baggies concept is a strange pretense given it's not very tasty pita."}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern in Montreal.  Moustaka and Lentil soup rock!  Will be back often... Go!"}
{"text":"They have a grilled falafel in pita there that is my favourite falafel in all of Montreal! 

They also have a similarly grilled sandwich filled with spinach called sabaneg or something like that. It's pretty good as well if you're a vegetarian.

The grilled falafel sandwich itself is unusual in that the falafel balls are flat and wet - but it rocks so hard that it's my fave in the city. (And I'm a self-confessed falafel freak).
It's a pretty popular place for both meat eaters and vegetarians like me so expect to wait in line if you go on the weekend. It's also fairly noisy. Ambience is casual and the place has a warmish feel with interesting art on the walls. I've been going there for about 12 years. It's also juuuuuust across the street from Fromagerie Hamel - a fine Montreal cheese shop."}
{"text":"ordered takeout because I was pretty busy. Fast, delicious, very well seasoned chicken wrap. It's a little bit on the expensive side for the quantity though, so take that in note when going there."}
{"text":"Excellents plats, très bonnes saveurs et les prix sont vraiment raisonnables. Et en plus l'endroit et le service sont agréables, je recommande!"}
{"text":"Wow, a little hard to find (or I just completely missed the sign) - but wow what a great find!  

We came on a Saturday night, and surprisingly only had a short wait.  The wait staff was really knowledgeable (and spoke English for me), sent over the Sommelier to help us choose our wine (which by the way was an excellent recommendation), and also pointed out vegetarian options for me to try.

The food was delicious, quick service, and surprising large portions.  I had the grilled pita with Za'tar, tomato and cheese, which also came with a small salad - we also started with Dolmathes.  

I found this to NOT be pricey - but we went for dinner, and I was expecting to pay far much more than we did.  Pita grilled sandwiches were aout $8 (really good deal), and the Dolmas were I think $9 or $10."}
{"text":"An amazing option in the city for middle Eastern food. The restaurant has two side and this is the more informal (less expensive) option. They serve great Syrian food and is one of a few great Syrian restaurants in Montréal. Now what to choose? ... that's hard since so much is very good, the lamb, the fish for unique and freaking tasty options. Or go more conservative with chicken, it doesn't really.atter because it is all very good. Once you come, you will regularly need your Alep fix.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Délicieux ! Le plat du jour Pita kaourma et la soupe de légumes pour un prix très raisonnable (moins de 20$)
Idéal pour le dîner dans un quartier qui ne propose pas forcément la même quantité/qualité pour un prix similaire."}
{"text":"Totalement impressionnée par ce petit restaurant qui ne paie pas de mine de l'extérieur. Nous avons pris une assiette végétarienne a 25$ avec un choix de plus de 7 entrées style houmous, mouhamara et autres. accompagné de salade fattoush et d'un pichet de sangria. Excellent service, très attentionné. Très rempli pour un mardi soir dès 18h30 il ne restait plus de tables de disponibles. Je recommande fortement"}
{"text":"We visited Le Petit Alep last night for the first time. We had checked it out the day before and noticed there were lots of people waiting at 8pm, so we thought we'd beat the crowds and get there by 6:15. Luckily we did, as we noticed people were already starting to wait for tables at the bar by 6:45. 

We were seated right away and brought menus and a bottle of cold water. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress came by to ask if we'd like drinks. We mentioned we would like a bottle of wine, so she said she'd have the sommelier come over. That seemed a little strange to us for such a casual restaurant. The sommelier arrived about 5 minutes later and suggested a few wines to us. We ordered and he brought our wine within a few minutes. He poured it for us and returned to top up our glasses a couple of times during our meal.

We waited for about 10 more minutes before our waitress reappeared to take our orders. We ordered the Aleppo cheese plate to start and 3 main dishes. We noticed that all tables were given a small basket with a bag or two of mini pitas. It seemed strange that the pitas were served in plastic bags, but I guess that's so that they won't dry out.

Our cheese plate arrived garnished with some fresh arugula. There were 8 slices of Aleppo cheese, drizzle with a little olive oil and what looked and tasted like a sprinkling of za'atar. It was quite tasty, but I felt it could have used a little something else (maybe olives?).

Our main dishes arrived a few minutes after we finished the cheese plate. We had one Chiche Kebab plate which had filet mignon with onions, topped with grilled pieces of pita bread, green salad and a rice/vermicelli combo. It was very tasty and the steak pieces were rare as requested.

We also ordered the Baked Lamb plate which had baked lamb in a sauce with pine nuts, rice and green salad. The lamb was quite tasty and moist. 

The final dish was Poutine D'Alep. This tasted exactly the same as the baked lamb dish, but it was served atop french fries which had the same sauce as the baked lamb and was also topped with aleppo cheese. It tasted just as good as the other lamb dish, but it really could have used a fresh element such as a salad as it was very heavy.

The waitress came by a few times during our meal and was very friendly, as were the other wait staff we encountered.

The prices were fairly good. Our bill was around $85 before tax and tip.

All in all it was quite a nice meal. If we were in the area for more than a week, we may return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My knowledge of Middle Eastern food is limited so I thought it would be good to try and expand it.  I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have discovered Le Petit Alep otherwise.  It's a great lunch place if you're in the Jean Talon Market area and is very reasonably priced.  The decor is cozy and the service is fast and friendly.

I ordered the kebab khach-khach which is a spicy ground beef served with tomatoes.  Many places will say something is spicy but few actually make it that way.  Le Petit Alep is one of the few that actually make it spicy.  The meat also fell apart and was very juicy.  It was served with grilled pita was were excellent and rice and salad.  They got the grilling right so that the pita wasn't burnt but you still got that nice, grilled taste.

For lunch they don't take reservations but as we were only two we didn't have a long wait.  I definitely want to go back here especially for dinner to try more of their menu because there was a lot more that seemed very appealing.  I think next time I would give the appetizers and desserts a shot."}
{"text":"I am mostly writing reviews so that I remember where I've been.  I don't really remember le petit alep, except that the food wasn't bad and the service was okay too.  We sat outside on a nice summer day in July.  I think that describes the place to me: good, but not memorable.  Maybe I've had too much middle eastern food, or maybe we ordered the wrong things?  I would go back."}
{"text":"I liked their food but yes it's quite pricey. I originally wanted to go to the Alep but ended up in Petit Alep because the lineup was CRAZY! Sat in their terrace and had a good evening supper, so yeah, quite worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are a tourist in Montreal and looking to go to a non-touristy area, this place is for you.  Le Petit Alep serves Syrian and Armenian food and has an extensive selection of wine.  The servers were quite knowledgeable and attentive (this is some of the best service I have experienced in Montreal) and sitting on the patio was delightful on a breezy summer evening.  The flavors and spices in the food were somewhat foreign to me, but quite enjoyable.  I would definitely be inclined to make a trip back to this restaurant and explore more selections of food and wine."}
{"text":"De bons mezzes, de belles assiettes. J'ai trouvé l'ensemble plutot bon et avec des tarifs raisonnables. C'est une chic cantine. Je retenterai mais plutot Alep !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat in Montreal. It is absolutely fantastic for so many reason: everything is amazing, all the way to the water they serve!!! Go with some friends and share a few plates, you will be astonished by all the flavours. Mixing them is even better.
It is simply phenomenal, and I strongly recommend. 
If the owners see this: thank you for many, many wonderful meals!"}
{"text":"First time I ever tasted Syrian food! Amazing!! Tasty. Delicious. Fair prices! Wine a bit over my budget, though. But that's MY budget for wines. Maybe you can find it not that expensive. Wine prices starts at $35 a bottle. But it's $50 in average. Don't be shy and ask for instructions to the waiters. They are super kind and very helpful! If you need a wine help, there is a sommelier as well! I strongly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"absolutely my favorite middle eastern restaurant in mtl authentic, casual, unpretentious, the best kebab, raw meat ever it is truly a hidden jam, being back from the middle east this place still get the same credits after my trip."}
{"text":"A classic in the JTM area, which I love and been loving for many years.

A casual restaurant with excellent Syrian and Armenian fare at affordable prices. Amongst the classics, if its your first time, I'd say you've got to try the metabal, the mouhamarra, the labneh with garlic, the shinklish salad made with tomatoes and cheese, fattoush salad and one of rolled pitas.

They have an excellent wine list, probably in part because of its bigger brother, the more refined Alep next door, along with a knowledgeable sommelier. If you're more into cocktails, theirs are excellent as well.

The only fault, in my opinion, is that they do not take reservations. Unless you arrive early or late, expect to wait 30 minutes up to an hour to get a table. Fear not, however, they will serve you drinks so that you can chat with your party until a table is available. I would prefer, however, to be able to reserve a table. In the end, though, the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Je suis en amour encore! Et oui, j'ai trouvé un autre recoin qui risque de me revoir souvent. Après plusieurs mois à essayer de trouver un bon moment pour y aller souper avec une bonne copine, le hasard nous finalement réunis une soirée où nos copains étaient occupés et on avait le goût de vraiment prendre notre temps pour souper, jaser et prendre un verre. Direction Petit Alep! Même si la file était longue, ça n'a vraiment pas pris de temps pour nous asseoir. Étant à une table quand même bien cachée, ça pris plus de temps pour prendre nos commandes, mais la rapidité avec laquelle les plats sont arrivés était assez impressionnante. Pourquoi 5 étoiles? Parce que la bouffe est extrêmement bonne et super bien assaisonnées, le décor est éclectique sans faire mal aux yeux, la musique est cool et l'ambiance générale est à la fois bohémienne, vibrante, branchée et décontractée. Je me vois très bien y retourner autant avec mon amoureux pour un souper romantique qu'avec ma famille complète. Donc si je me souviens des règles de \"cruise\" je dois attendre 3 jours avant d'y retourner? C'est trop long il me semble!"}
{"text":"Les plats sont délicieux; les vins et les conseils sont toujours justes; et l'ambiance est parfaite."}
{"text":"Ouiiiiii j'aime le petit Alep. Pourquoi je n'avais jamais fait un review avant aujourd'hui? Aucune idée. Peut-être que j'y suis souvent allée en première date et que je me garde une petite gêne pour prendre des photos de bouffe dans ce temps là. Mais bon. Hier j'étais libre de vivre ma vie alors voici mon review! D'abord, c'est un Resto chaleureux et accessible: rapport qualité prix je trouve ça assez imbattable. Petit bémol: on ne peut pas réserver et soyez averti c'est toujours plein. Par contre on peut prendre un verre et manger un mezze en patientant. Nous avons d'ailleurs grignoté un métabal en sirotant un excellent verre de blanc qui nous a été conseillé par le charmant sommelier. On peut y manger des mezzes ou des plats. Ils offrent 2 menus dégustations: un à 2 services pour 23$ et un à 3 service pour 28$ (je pourrais me tromper de quelques dollars pour les prix mais c'est a peu près ça). 
Alors nous avons pris, mon amie et moi, le menu dégustation 3 services. C'était vraiment délicieux. Premier service en fraîcheur: taboulé avec labneh et fromage syrien: on met un peu de labneh sur une feuille de laitue romaine on garni de taboulé et hop! Ensuite on grignote un petit bout de fromage c'était parfait:) Ensuite, nous avons mangé de la saucisse d'Alep et des crevettes terbialy (jouissif), le tout venait avec une salade fattouche, un mouhamara et un humus. Au dernier service: l'agneau au four et le filet mignon terbialy. Les viandes étaient cuites à point et étaient super tendre. De la bouffe extraordinaire servi par un staff super sympathique. Ne vous laissez pas intimider par l'haleine d'ail que vous aurez en sortant de là, ça en vaut vraiment la peine! Bonus: l'été ils ont une terrasse."}
{"text":"An absolute treasure with a relaxed atmosphere and quick service! The feuilles de vigne were absolutely amazing!!"}
