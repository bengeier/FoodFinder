{"text":"Stopped in for lunch a few days ago.. We had Gyros, wings and pizza.. Loved everything! I love sweet sauce so this pizza was perfect. The gyros were super filled and very good and the wings were really tasty too...The price was really reasonable, the guys working were super friendly and the food was on point...Adding this place to our favorite pizza shops!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the 4th of July for the slice special. It was my first time there and all I can say is this place has some awesome pie! The sweet sauce is fantastic. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I just ate a great tasting pizza tonight..mind you I order it 20 min till close...it was so dam good ..these dudes are going to do it big up there....awesome job guys keep the good work up.....and also the owed is pretty cool he is personable guy...see you guys real soon"}
{"text":"I don't know what Curtis is talking about. I got the two gyro special for $8.50 and they were amazing. The owner is personable and personally made them for me. They were busy and he (unlike most pizza shop owners) was running back and forth helping all of his staff on both sides of the kitchen. I have tried many items on the menu, and have not been disappointed yet. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Still loving their food. I've been sticking with their chicken wings. Mmmmm! You get 6 whole wings (I only order buffalo mild) with a hefty side of ranch or bleu cheese. The other day, I took my client for dinner and she ordered a small pizza w/ pepperoni. It looked amazing and I wanted to try a piece; however, withheld from doing so, as I am on a low carb diet."}
{"text":"We ordered two pies the other night. We've ordered there before and the biggest complaint is the sauce. Its super sweet. Almost like candy. Anyway, we got a large bacon and a large pepperoni. The bacon bits were decent but it was obviously cheap pepperoni. They put a ton of cheese on the pizza, which is nice. But the pizza is poorly made. There were pizza bubbles on both pies and the dough/crust is super thin in the middle and way too thick on the end. The cheese ended up sliding off of the pizza and I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  I've probably learned my lesson on this one. Much better pizza in the area than this stuff."}
{"text":"Called in was given a 45 minute delivery eta when it was an hour late we called and they said it was with the driver after an hour and half we called again the customer service is weak. The food was cold and not to mention they are only 5 minutes down the road will not order again and I plan on calling the boss"}
{"text":"Great food. Delivery was earlier than expected. Everything in my order was piping hot and fresh! The wings were whole and flavorful. Hot pepper cheese balls were still gooey in the center and the white pizza had nice garlicky taste."}
{"text":"Ordered several pies for a birthday party, the service was very good and friendly. Delivered on time without an issue. But,  sadly for the price the pizza was not that good. Next time I will save the money and go to Little Ceasers. We had a lot left over and afterwords heard the same from other people."}
{"text":"Now that they are under new management I would totally recommend these guys.   Hard worker and very community oriented.    The pizza is fabulous.  Haven't eaten in yet so I'm unable to say anything about atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh. No reason not to stop in for a pizza every time I pass by. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So I got a new flyer in the mail and saw this place had real gyros so I decided to give it a shot. Bad decision. So I ordered 4 gyros, plain,  with sauce on the side. They said 1/2 hr. To 45 minutes. An hour later, it take 10 minutes drive from my house, and if you ever bought a gyro from a gyro shop you know it takes about 1-2 minutes to make 1, and what I got was 4 plain gyros, no sauce, and 5 small pieces of meat on each large size pita. We called and told the owner about forgetting the sauce and commented on the size. The said don't worry he would send 4 new ones with the sauce and to return the others. Once again 1 hour later, 4 got 4 gyros with the sauces and 6 pieces of meat on each. Thanks for \"taking\" care of it. Total waste of time and money. You could have taken the meat from 3 and made 1 gyro from Mike & Tony's on liberty ave. And the sauce was some crappy store bought stuff. Will not order from again. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza place in Brentwood by far. The sauce is great and the crust reminds me of the Chicago style butter crust. I also have tried the gyros and steak hoagie and I must say I was impressed with everything. I am always greeted by the owner when I come in and I always feel welcome which is why I was surprised by some of the other comments. The only negative experience I've ever had was that once the crust was burnt on the bottom (of course this was the time I was introducing this to a few friends). That being said the burnt pizza was still better than most of the places in the nearby area. I introduced this to my coworkers and now we order it all the time for B-Days. I would certainly check this place out of you are looking for a tasty pizza at a reasonable price then check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just called to check on my order- was told it would be 40 min but it has now been twice that time. I was told the delivery was on its way and the driver would be here within 5 minutes. I was told that 15 min ago. I live 5 minutes down the road! He just got here. First time in my life I ever didn't leave a tip.   I ordered a plain cheese pizza and some pepperoni rolls at 1pm on a Monday. Come on, guys. Inexcusable. I normally try to be fair and not complain but it wouldn't be an honest Yelp review if I didn't point this all out. Sorry. For what it's worth, the pepperoni rolls are really good. Just not worth waiting an hour and a half for."}
{"text":"Great news! This pizza shop is under NEW ownership! !   My co-workers and i decided to give it a try!   Let me say, it was a GREAT decision!    We had a large pirogie pizza! Omg! What a treat! Thick and cheesy! Onions! Butter!  SO good!  We will DEFINITELY be ordering from them again! Give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"Utterly terrible, just ordered and I can't believe how gross it is. Pizza- taste like chef-boy-r-d or school lunch pizza, it is big and doughy, the sauce is just tomatoe paste and sugar and cheese has no taste, like really cheap cheese food. Wings- lumbo wings and not cooked well, no crispy skin, soggy gross skin and the garlic parm is tasteless. Steak hoagie is cheap steakum meat with no seasoning on thick un-toasted white stale roll. Nothing has any flavor and textures all off..do not order, so gross and waste of money."}
{"text":"We were greeted when we walked in which was nice but it went downhill from there. We ordered at the counter, paid for our food, and went to sit down. All of the smaller tables were dirty so we sat at a big table. Then a big party came in. So we gave them our table and went to a smaller one. My husband asked for something to clean off the table and they handed him a rag. When a customer asks for something to clean their table what should happen is that you should be a little embarrassed you have dirty tables and then go clean the tables-NOT hand a customer a rag.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our pizza. It was just us and the big group and we ordered way before them. When they finally brought our pizza it was in a box. I took that as a hint to leave but we didn't. The pizza looked really good but the crust was very dense. We didn't care for it.  I say skip this place because the Burgh has way too many pizza shops to settle for this kind of service and food."}
{"text":"If you like a sweet sauce then this is place for you.  I got a small general tso chicken pizza and a small pepperoni pizza.  The general tso pizza would have been good if the toppings weren't just in the middle of the pizza.  I had more crust than pizza.   It was like they just threw it in the middle and it was the same way with the pepperoni pizza.  You'd get about 4 bites and the rest was just plain bubbled up dough.  The general tso would probably be better with a thicker crust because I had to use a spatula to get the piece out and onto my plate because as soon as I'd go to pick it up everything was just falling off.  That also could be because the toppings weren't evenly distributed all over."}
