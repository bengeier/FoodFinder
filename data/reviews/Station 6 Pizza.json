{"text":"Station 6 pizza has a sort of legacy to live up to- having taken the place of Zelma's pizza. I am pleased to say that it more than matches it. The lunch buffet is very well managed, keeping stocked and having a regular fresh rotation of tasty basic and specialty pizzas. The staff seen friendly but most of my experience with Station 6 was the buffet so they weren't particularly involved, and I personally had no interest in the salad bar so that is not a factor in my review."}
{"text":"The Good:    -The garlic parmesan wings (sort of).  The Meh:   - The potato skins. With cheese and bacon, it can't be horrible, but the skins   themselves were mushy on half.   - The pizza. We ordered a small, cheese thin crust. It was okay, because it's pizza. But it wasn't great.  The Bad:   - The mozzarella cheese sticks. We got two in our sampler platter, and one did not have cheese in it.    - The wings. We ordered six wings, and got three, which was extremely disappointing because they were the best thing we had received.  Overall, as this is the second time we've ordered from Station 6 Pizza, we will not be giving them a third chance."}
{"text":"Went to eat lunch yesterday here and there were two notes on the door one was from the health department they have been shut down and the second was a disconnect notice from the power company whhereat the hell happened ."}
{"text":"The salad bar here was great, fresh and had stuff for kids. The lunch pizza Buffett also had lots of variety and was delicious! But better then the food was the customer service. We arrived as the lunch buffet was just closing and they let us enjoy it anyway.  I will definitely be a repeat customer here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at station 6 pizza a handful of times and am never disapointed. I like to go for there lunch time buffet and try different pizzas and the salad bar. They do very well at keeping the bar stocked with hot and fresh yumminess. They also have a pizza desert!"}
{"text":"Came for pizza lunch buffet. Super affordable--drink and salad bar included. Good selection of pizza with a variety of sauces/toppings. Love the crust--crispy and not too thick. Pizza was fresh even though we came at the end of the lunch hour. New pizzas added to buffet while we were eating. Really enjoyed the breadsticks. Dessert pizza was sweet but good.   Interesting atmosphere. Each booth had a tv. Not too loud though.   All in all good value. We will go back. :)"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. So much good pizza. Tons of options!! I had the Hawaiian, cheeseburger, all meat, and chicken bacon ranch pizzas. The dessert pizza with chocolate chips on it tasted just like a chocolate chip cookie! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"The first time I had their pizza it was way too sweet and I did not like it.  Then I found out that they have other sauces to choose from so I tried it with the traditional sauce.  All in all it was not too bad.  It still has some sweet to it.  The ingredients were very good and fresh.  It is cheaper than most pizza places in town.  I reheated a couple of slices just to see how they reheat and they were OK."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Station 6. There are many good pizza restaurants in Champaign, yet this is one of our go-to's. The pizza is delicious - hot, fresh and unique. We really like the traditional sauce, crispy thin crust, firehouse supreme, meat pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza. Also, this place has the best boneless wings of any pizza place we have been to - the mango habanero sauce is wonderful. Great food, consistent and reliable - I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"They have been open for a couple of years, but we only recently have begun eating there thanks to an exchange student staying with us who is addicted to the buffet. Station 6 pizza is part of a three restaurant mini-chain. with outlets in Bloomington and Peoria; the others are called \"Fire Station Pizza.\" This one is Station 6 so as not to be confused with other places in town with the fire station or fire house name.   We've only been there for the buffet lunch, so that is all I will discuss in this review. When you enter the restaurant you walk up to the counter and pay for the buffet. The space has large windows on two sides, allowing plenty of light. It is not large, but it seems almost cavernous because of the high (20 foot) ceiling. Above the windows are an array of fire station memorabilia- shirts, hoses, hats, pictures, axes, etc. Other than that, the only real decoration is a huge fire truck mural on the west wall.  The south wall is taken up by the register, the buffet, and the soda fountain. The buffet is entirely self-serve.   There is a nice salad bar. It is small in terms of selection, maybe 30 items, but it is very good. Unlike the big-chain competition with a pizza buffet lunch, the salad ingredients here are very fresh. Nothing in the salad bar has that chemical taste that bagged lettuce (etc) is so famous for having.  The ingredients are fresh, and the \"bins\" kept filled. We like it, but, as I noted, the selection is basic. The only dressing I have tried is the bleu cheese dressing. It is really superior. Big chunks of bleu cheese throughout, and it tastes as if it is made in house; with those big chunks of cheese, it would never make its way out of a bottle! Their web site claims that everything is fresh, prepared in house, with no preservatives, etc. And the salad bar seems to confirm it.    Our only salad bar complaint, other than the small selection, may be that everything is sliced really small. I mean pico de gallo small.  Everything except the fresh spinach leaves, anyway.  The carrots are sliced like match sticks, the cucumbers, peppers, onions, and even hard-boiled eggs are a small dice. Nothing really wrong with this, but it can make the salad a bit difficult to eat with a fork. No \"forking\" the pepper slices here; you just use the fork like a mini-shovel, so it can be messy.  Twice we've gone home with at least one of us needing to change shirts due to a messy salad shirt/blouse spill.  The pizza buffet itself is the main attraction for most people. It is kept pretty full of pizzas, most with one or two toppings, but you might find the occasional \"lovers\" pizza there too. They are a mix of thin crust and medium crust pizzas, and there usually is a desert pizza on the counter as well as breadsticks. I've not tried desert pizzas, but the other pizzas are quite good. One of the better choices in a town filled with decent pizza joints. Even pizzas of which I was skeptical turned out to be pretty good. While not my favorite, a dill pickle, Canadian bacon, olive, and onion pizza was much better than it sounded. They have a really  tasty four cheese, thin crust pizza that has a nice crispy crust with cheeses that don't completely meld into a single flavor. I like that you can taste all of them. Our exchange student likes the vegetarian pizzas a lot. She likes this restaurant a lot, with one caveat: While each table has at least two hot-sauces and Peperoncino, a shaker of Parmesan cannot be found in the restaurant. Even so, she says this place is much preferred to the hut, which has parmesan but inferior pizza and salad.  The staff is attentive, always asking if everything is good, if they can take your empty dishes, etc. Obviously, during buffet hours, they don't take orders or bring you any food.   There is both table and booth seating. We always take a table, primarily because every booth has a small flat-screen TV (that you can control), and meals, for us, are one of the few times we actually have good conversations. But, if you are bringing kids without another adult, or are there alone, or simply are with people to whom you would rather not speak, I can see the appeal of the TV's.    The staff behind the counter, at least during buffet hours, also is helpful if you ask. Sometimes if there is a vacant pizza spot them to make whatever kind you would like put out. It doesn't have to be a \"standard menu\" pizza, so go ahead and ask. I guess they might refuse if you ask for something too weird; I don't imagine they'd make a chocolate and pickle pizza, for example, but they made a really good spinach, roast garlic, ham, and feta pizza when we asked. (It was delicious!)  So, all in all their buffet gets high marks. Perhaps we'll go for their sandwiches, pastas, calzones, etc., sometime and I'll make this more comprehensive. Until then this is our go-to pizza buffet in CU."}
{"text":"So, I am a 13 year old boy, with a peanut allergy. We ordered pizza from there it is amazing, and they are allergy friendly. They also have some of the BEST bread sticks I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"We had the thin chicken parm pizza and salad bar. Fresh ingredients and very good crust made for a great dining experience. The salad bar was adequate and the service was quick and friendly. The Diet Mountain Dew had an off taste and we know that isn't because of the great Champaign water. What gives? Also they ran or of thick crust by 7:15 on a Friday night. Either they had a very busy day or someone isn't planning well.   All in all a good experience, though."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken bacon ranch pizza tonight. Seriously one of the best pizzas I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of our families favorite pizza places in Champaign. Most Gluten -Free options aren't that great this one is spot on. The bread sticks are great and sauces as well. Also the buffet is affordable and tasty! The best part is dessert for us the giant cookie with ice cream comes out in a hot cast iron skillet! Yum!"}
{"text":"Well.. Where do I begin!?  Last week my boyfriend and I came in to eat in and our waitress mumbled the whole time.. Took our appetizer order.. Didn't offer is water with our beer.. Sooo we waited 20 minutes and still no Bosco Sticks.. The table that came in AFTER us however got theirs before us.. So as I watch our appetizers come out and sit under the heat lamp the waitress ignored us.. Then our pizza joined our appetizer under the lamps. We got the Bosco Sticks with cold pizza sauce. Less than 5 minutes later we got our pizza and no offer for refills. We never did see our waitress still she brought our check.  Now.. Icing on the cake- tonight.. We order pizza online.. Two pizzas one plain cheese one supreme. It said 25 minutes. We went in and stood in like for 20 minutes and the girl took our money but no food. We keep waiting. More people kept piling in. Still no food. Were up to 35 minutes waiting when someone guy comes out and says THEY RAN OUT OF DOUGH! So we kept standing there and THREE people took our name looking for our food and them someone offers to make it.. Thought you ran out of dough?! Lets then mention the mean faced unfriendly hostess stood at the register and talked to nobody and didn't help us. All those people in there and nobody was helping or offering comped meals or anything. I then demanded the owners name TWICE and was lied to about his name.  We then took our money and went to a chain pizza place had friendly quick service and 2 hours later have eaten.   Who doesn't make enough dough as a fricken pizza place when you're offering large pizzas for under $10 as a special when the students are back in town with their families!? Why was nobody taking names and offering coupons or their meals free!?   Word will continue to be spread about Station 6 and their terrible service. Their prices aren't bad and their food isn't bad but what the heck does that matter?! Pretty sure Papa Johns and Dominos would do a better job than this place.  I will rant about this to everyone. Will rant on Facebook and Twitter. There's just no no way!  STAY AWAY FROM STATION 6! Their rude stuck up unfriendly faced hostess will ignore you.. Your waitress will ignore you.. Your food (if they have dough) will take forever and be mediocre. You'll leave wishing you went to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Pizza was under cooked, got ignored by our waitress who we could see standing outside talking on her phone, and the Parmesan container on our table was full of blue and green moldy cheese. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Trying out places I've never been in champaign-Urbana, and would definitely recommend this place! Had the buffet, and the pizza and breadsticks were great! Great selection! Very welcoming feel!"}
{"text":"The salad bar had lots of toppings. The lettuce was just plain , shredded iceberg lettuce so that left a little to be desired. The hot bar only had 3 main pizzas, 1 dessert pizza  and breadsticks. If you ask me that's very little selection for a buffet. I entered the restaurant at 12:45 on a Sunday so still during a busy time that a buffet should be well stocked. I did not care for the marinara sauce or pizza sauce as they both had a sweeter than typical flavor. Restaurant staff looked more like hoodlums than anything. Kitchen staff wore saggy pants and you could see their underpants. I feel like professionalism of employees was lacking at this establishment. The employees also need a crash course in customer service. Buffet was $9 and included drink. I could get a much better value elsewhere ."}
{"text":"This place is great- possibly the best pizza in town right now. I love their specialty pizzas, most notably the BLT and cheeseburger supreme pizzas."}
{"text":"Ordered a margarita pizza and chicken tenders for my boy.  Pizza was a tad greasy and the chicken tenders were a little on the crispier side.  The buffet looked a little iffy as it may have been sitting out.  I liked that the pizza had a thin crust and had the right amount of seasoning.  The  woman behind  the counter could have been a little bit nicer.  This was my first time there with a 1 1/2 year old.  She looked preoccupied with a ton of receipts spread all over the counter.  She barked at me because i didnt spit out the type of pizza that i wanted.  You bark  at me and I'll bark right back.  Minused a star for service.  Most definitely will be back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new pizza place near campus so we gave Station 6 a try.   Ordered an XL pepperoni, paid online, and picked up in person, very convenient.  It was a lot for 2 people, but I didn't see anywhere that said the size of the pies in inches, so I'd say this was roughly 18''.  It tasted above average for being what seems like a chain pizza place. The cheese was nice and thick, the sauce a little sweet, well-seasoned and the crust wasn't too crispy or soft. I'd probably order heavy/extra sauce next time as some parts it seemed a little lacking.  Other than that a solid choice for slightly more inexpensive pizza. Definitely a little better than Papa John's/Pizza Hut but probably not quite top shelf.  I'll have to find a coupon next time I order."}
{"text":"Ate here twice when had coupons very good. The coupons backfired because used to those prices now hate to pay full price. Thought the food good."}
{"text":"The breadsticks honestly - if you're trying to resist carbs, do NOT order them because they're freaking great. Why is their marinara sauce cold though? It should be heated."}
