{"text":"Rooster is a classic example of farm-to-table cooking. Locally sourced ingredients prepared with with care in an open kitchen. The setting is elegant without being pretentious. Our waiter was informed and made some excellent recommendations. 

Started with the charcuterie sampler which included house smoked salmon, 2 cheeses, 2 house made salami and olives. Dinner included pork loin with grits and kale. Also, a nice pan seared sole with vegetables. A side of the pan roasted corn went well with all.

Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"They do a great job of getting you in the door, by pumping the fumes from the kitchen out onto College St.  As you walk by, your mouth starts to water.  The food is excellent, the service is great, and the prices are very fair.  If I had any complaint it would be the smallish size of the entrees, but it is just enough to make you leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent Experience - the ambience is energetic and the activity in the open kitchen is very impressive. The appetizers were okay, but the rest of the meal was excellent. Our entrees were duck confit and scallops, and both were delicious. Our sides were pan fried corn and fingerling potatoes, and both were very good. For dessert we had the banana pie which was also very good. Overall we were very happy with the meal and glad we found a great local restaurant rather than a chain. We'll definitely come Bach when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First visit Thursday night and already planning a return trip. Excellent service by all of the staff from greeter in bar to managers on duty.  Chris, our server,  was very attentive. Beef short rib and au gratin potatoes are not to be missed."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte.  Great cheese and meat plate.  Can't go wrong with the bison burger."}
{"text":"I've been to Roosters many times over the years-I love the atmosphere. The chicken is to die for and the servers always have friendly attitudes. Sometimes, I go with my husband; other times, I bring my family. It's a great place for either type of outing. It's also a good place to go on a regular basis-menu never gets old!"}
{"text":"Went to Roosters with my mom last night. Were from Boston and we wanted a nice Southern place to eat at. I found Roosters and we feel in love. The food was amazing. We got the hanger steak, Mac n cheese and corn. I gobbled it all down it was so good.

The service was super great too. The waiters and the host were so lovely and helpful. One of the waitresses wrote down directions to a shopping district. She was very helpful. The manager was super nice too and gave us his card. Enjoyable experience!!"}
{"text":"I went to Roosters because of all the great reviews . I must say I was disappointed the amount of food you get for the price left us thinking really!!!! The flavor was very good , but don't go if your hungry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The staff is always nice, the environment is always warm and welcoming, and the food is always AMAZING! I always order the BBQ chicken. It is a rotisserie chicken (awesome portion) with homemade BBQ sauce. The sides I have had are the mac n cheese, au gratin potatoes, and asparagus. They are all so yummy. The bread with oil and vinegar is to die for. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! My first visit was during lunch. It was so good I came back the same night for dinner. I absolutely LOVE the fried oysters. They are seasoned and fried PERFECTLY. And the accompanying marinara sauce is excellent. It's so light and fresh and packed with flavor. IMHO these are the best fried oysters in Charlotte. 

I also love the smoked chicken wings and sautéed spinach, which are available on both the lunch and dinner menus.  Recently, I tried the Scallop Salad which is served over arugula. It includes corn, avocado, and lime buttermilk dressing. The scallops were delicious!!  I have also tried the grilled yellow tail, which was one of the nightly dinner specials. It was very enjoyable. 

The atmosphere is upscale rustic. The first level is a trendy bar, with specials after 4pm. The upper level houses the restaurant and kitchen.  It's a great place for lunch or dinner. The dinner menu is more extensive. They also have a concise, yet interesting wine list. Add this place to your list! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"After attending an event uptown, we arrived at Rooster's on College Street at 8:50 last night (11/17)  to be told they closed the kitchen just before we came in.  When we stated that their website says they close at 10:00, the hostess informed us that the restaurant has an \"Open-close\" policy...which means they are open to decide when to close. So, we went down the street to another establishment that was extremely happy to have our business.  Why publish closing hours if they are not valid.  This is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"Food was great!! My husband got the fried chicken  sandwich and I got the meatloaf. Both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Decadent and delicious. Eaten here twice and they know their food. Everything I've tried was very well prepared. The kind where you take a bite and there's a burst of flavour in your mouth. Yep! The one time they had a dessert in a hot plate - kind of a custard. Oh my!! Disappointed to not find it again cause apparently it was a special. I'd recommend the salmon and any sides!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service too but the Coconut Cake is to die for - it is simply delicious"}
{"text":"I'm assuming this is a new location given the lack of reviews. 
 - we had no problem seating a party of 6 without reservations on a Monday night.
- Waitress did a nice job choosing a wine by the glass for me with no direction other than a white that is not a Chardonnay and offered a taste of her selection before giving me a full pour.
--as mentioned in reviews for the other location, servings are not huge and sides are a la carte.
--they were willing to make substitutions (e.g. no arugula) for one of the members of the party.
--offered to split the checks to accommodate various expense accounts.

As for the food:
I ordered 1/4 \"natural\" chicken (which I assume means that it was not the BBQ), dark meat and while it looked beautiful, it was dry. Although it was served with lots of liquid, the meat itself was still chewier than I'd like. 
Roasted fingerling pototoes--were tasty
Coffee drink after (the one with chocolate liqueur and Bailey's) was just kind of meh--nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"One word: Spectacular!  The Short Ribs are the best I have ever had.  Service, food location all excellent."}
{"text":"Sat at the kitchen bar upstairs, food was fine until my wife pointed out (who's a chef) no one in the kitchen wears gloves. We were OK initially until we saw a guy in the kitchen cleaning flour from the breading station basket in the garbage can by first using a spoon or knife to get flour off then by hitting the basket inside the top of the garbage can and then putting it right back in the flour station right in front of me!!!! Constantly seeing cooks wiping their nose scratching and then going back to making food!!! Will not be back and advise on not going."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Our reservation was found promptly and we were immediately seated. Service was prompt. They got a wrong side dish but when I pointed that out they immediately replaced it with the right one. Chicken was good and moist. Definitely above average."}
{"text":"Not sure why there aren't more 5 star reviews.  I thought the food was incredible--especially the fava bean frito (which is a \"du jour\" item so not sure if it will be available regularly, esp. since it's a seasonal dish).  Everything was flavorful and flavored well (I hate having to add salt to things, so getting that flavor balance right is key).  The mac and cheese was smoky and the addition of gruyere quite key.  The onion ring straws were fantastic/addictive.  The roast chicken was moist and delicious.  And the roasted beets were sweet and nutty and we ordered 2 dishes between 3 of us because we loved them so much.  My cousin and husband split a lemon tart that, initially, they thought they'd only take a bite of for something sweet at the end of the meal, but they ended up licking the plate clean.

Came here for dinner--had good service--maybe it's different at lunch but I really thought it was great."}
{"text":"This was a debate between 2 and 3 stars. I give them a star for ambience. Great atmosphere for a cold winter's night.  The second star was for the excellent waitress and manager who tried to make our terrible meal better. 
We tried the short ribs (told it was best meal on menu). I have had grandmas two day-old pot roast taste better and more moist than that.  They tried to make it right by bringing out the scallops as a swap and a complimentary fried oysters app. The scallops were ok but nothing special. The oysters could have stayed in the kitchen. 
Additionally, all of our food was out to us in less 10m (prob 5m) from ordering. I like good service but whoa...i don't even think we toast our (canned) beer yet!
All in all, i really wanted to like this place but for the money, there are many better places out there."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience at Roosters Uptown. Every bite was fresh and delicious starting with some of the best calamari ever. Our mains were great including duck confit and short rib. The real pleasure of the night was the Mac and Cheese which we ate every bite of, well, actually we ate every bite of everything! The service was also spot on with friendly service and great recommendations all night. Perfect date spot in Uptown. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!! Was not expecting it to be so amazing and for the prices it was wonderful with fabulous service! Went there with a girl friend and had drinks. We also split the Mac and cheese - mussels and calamari! The mussels were by far the best deal there for only 11.00 - being able to soak it all up with bread!  The restaurant itself was really beautiful too with old barn wood and metal - gave it a very rustic feel! Will definitely be back and recommending this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here for a date night because it was close to the venue we needed to walk to.

It looked expensive - the lighting was dark. Don't you all think that means a restaurant is expensive???

Anyways, I was right...I mean expensive is relative, but compared to what we're used to, it was...but that's OK. The food was fu**ing fantastic. 

Why then only four stars???, well, because it was pricey and because the portions was small, in my opinion. The food was so good that I wanted more of everything we got, but to get more, we would have had to place a second order and shell out another $150 or so and that night we could not...we had a show to go to.

Next time though, I'll remember to get three orders of the liver mousse...one as an appetizer, one to go with my normal meal and one to take home..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice for birthday dinners and I must say the service and the food is very good! Each time we've had the big table by the escalator and it was so nice having that area to ourselves. The staff is very nice and the beef ribs are delicious!! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I travelled from York, SC to meet friends for a concert Uptown on Thursday evening. One of the couples we were joining made a reservation for six at the Roosters Uptown location.

In the spirit of full disclosure, four of us arrived 15 minutes late to join the third couple at our reserved table. We entered the Bank of America complex on the wrong side and took a scenic tour of several catwalks, escalator banks and retail corridors in our quest to find the restaurant!  We were definitely late, and we accept responsibility for that.

However, a note to Rooster's:
(1) If you seat us, you are implying that it is within your professional capacity to serve us in a timely manner. 
(2) If it is apparent that you are in the midst of a rush you were inadequately prepared to handle, please alert the patrons arriving 15 minutes late to their reservation that it is in their best interest to dine elsewhere.
(3) If your server is so far in the weeds to be unable, in retrospect, to take appetizer orders within the first 1/2 hour of the experience (let alone entree selections), simply be apologetic and bring our checks when they are requested. Snarky, rude servers reflect very poorly on the managerial staff of any establishment.

As far as the actual dining room and the tiny sampling of the menu we accomplished:
(1) The ambience is fantastic. In an area surrounded by modern, sleek and minimalist designs, Roosters manages to carve out a tiny niche reminiscent of a converted farmhouse, complete with lowered ceilings, weathered wood tables and beautiful iron chandeliers. The restaurant felt intimate and casual but with an elegant touch.
(2) The Skinny Margarita Martini was perfect. Fresh lime pulp added just enough tartness....full flavor, ice cold, and delicious.
(3) The beer selection was fairly good and was served very cold. The server offered an excellent suggestion to my husband when his first choice was not available.
(4) The bread is hardy, with a nutty flavor - paired with the dipping oil it is a wonderful start to what could have been a rich and tasty dinner.
(5) Only negative; the water was strangely metallic and, well...yucky."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience, excellent wait staff. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, and was always ready to give us a helping hand. We got there a bit late and was stuck about 30 mins after they closed, and we never once felt rushed to leave. I would love to eat there again"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Rooster's last night (05/31/2012).  We had the speckled trout special, the hanger steak, the potato gnocchi, the polenta, and the asparagus. All the food was delicious.

Rooster's has a diverse, decent, reasonably priced wine list. We enjoyed a Spanish Priorat."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when Someone suggested this place.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was delicious!  I order the scallops and the kale salad.  My guest ordered the chicken and potatoes.  Be prepared for a la carte ordering though."}
{"text":"Thank you Rooster's for being so accommodating to my family and friends. I've now been to this location on 2 occasions (and planned a dinner there for my husband and his friends) and both times the staff was absolutely wonderful! I came here with a group of girls before going out on the town for a bachelorette night  and then again for a birthday party. Many restaurants do not handle large groups well or often turn them down but Rooster's handles the service of a large party wonderfully!!!! I seriously could not have asked for better service on both occasions. The food is really good- not the best in Charlotte but it is delicious and there are a good range of options and price ranges. I love the kale salad! If you are planning a night out with friends or a celebration- the staff at Rooster's will take care of you! We had 25 people and there was not one complaint on the food or service. I haven't been a server but I'm sure it's not easy to handle a party of that size so thank you Rooster's! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Rooster's was delicious. I believe our waitress' name was Heather and she was amazing, very helpful with ordering. Charcuterie, pizza, wings, corn and au gratin potatoes were all great."}
{"text":"Moderate cost, American food. Very good, excellent pilsner beer. Wood fired chicken awesome."}
{"text":"Love their Kale caesar. The kale has never tasted so good. It is not at all bitter. The tomato basil bisque is yum too!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. BBQ chicken was nice. But I noticed small mouse on the floor:( it spoiled my impression."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Our server handled our big and often very distracted group really well and made great recommendations. She also helped accommodate my complicated dietary restrictions Ina helpful and understanding way."}
{"text":"What a great establishment! This place was just perfect! We had the scallops, asparagus with the au gratin potatoes and the smoked wings! The food and service was excellent!!

I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews of the beef short ribs and mac and cheese and wasn't disappointed.   

The place was very busy for a Wednesday night I'm downtown Charlotte, which was surprising. 

The decor and ambiance was better than expected and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, if pricey.  Basic stuff, well prepared. This low rating is because of the service, which was inexcusable. Our waiter was overwhelmed, which is understandable if you have a good attitude about it. Instead, this guy chose to be rude. By the time our food came we still did not have napkins or silverware. I tried to flag the guy down, but he was \"busy\" so he kept walking back and forth past our table taking care of other things, carefully avoiding making eye contact. I finally asked another waitress for silverware, which she brought... without a napkin.  And also without silverware and a napkin for my wife.  After finally completing the protracted fork negotiation, we ate our competently prepared food.  When it was time for the check, the waiter dropped it on the table, literally without stopping or making eye contact. I've worked in restaurants and while I have a couple pet peeves I'm generally patient because I know how it is.  Just acknowledge it and apologize and I'm fine. This was really disappointing. There are plenty of other options. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It is difficult to write a review for this place because there is nothing wrong with it. However, nothing sticks out. The food is very good. Service has always been very good as well. The only problem is the menu is boring.  The way that they describe the food in the menu makes you want to yawn."}
{"text":"I would come back again. The atmosphere was great, with natural wood and warm, dim lighting. There was a small issue due to a mixup with the beer I ordered. I had requested an IPA and was served an ale made by the same brewery. Thinking that the waitress had misheard the order due to the similar names, I didn't mention it because I don't like to complain. However when the bill came, I was charged for the IPA which was 3$ more. When I tried to explain this to the waitress she became defensive, said she served the IPA and said \"well if you just want it removed I will remove it.\" I said I don't want a free beer, I just want to pay for what I received. The manager (who had come by once before to check on us during the meal) came over and took a glance and whiff at the small amount of beer left in the glass and told me that I certainly had received an ale. She apologized and took that beer, along with my boyfriend's beer off the bill. She apologized and thanked us several more times on our way out. This establishment is obviously well managed, and that's the reason I recommend it."}
{"text":"The short ribs were excellent the rotisserie chicken was delicious and onion rings were great!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening around 8 PM. Parking is a bit expensive around the area, but that might have been because there was a Hornets game that night. 
We were seated quickly. Their drinks are very strong, which is great since the average drink is $13. 
We started off with the calamari. It was fresh and crunchy; came with 2 sauces, both amazing.
Boyfriend had the hanger steak. It was delicious, my only gripe is how little is served.
I had the beef short ribs. Amazing and tender, I was able to cut into it easily with my fork. Portion was ok.
We shared 3 sides: mac and cheese (ooey gooey cheesiness), assorted mushrooms (I would drink the sauce it comes in if it weren't for the fact that I'd be looked at as an animal), and the fingerling potatoes (simple potato wedges). 
They special dessert they had that evening was a bread pudding with a vanilla créme. It was ridiculously decadent. I was in love with every bite.
Service was great. Server was friendly and attentive. 
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday with 7pm reservations.  There were several empty tables around us but they quickly filled up.  Nice decor and a comfortable setting.  From the Bank of America parking garage, go through the doors near the elevators on Level 6.  A short walk takes you to a down escalator that puts you at the upstairs entrance.

The food was very good and our server, Matt, was very helpful as we navigated the menu.  His knowledge of the menu was on point as he explained the differences in the red wine reductions served over the duck breast and beef short ribs.  (Duck breast sauce more sweet and short ribs sauce more savory.)

We shared the charcuterie sampler (3 meats, 2 cheeses and crostini served with olives and hot mustard.)  We made our selections from both the standard menu and the daily menu, which included sopresatta and salami.  A great appetizer for sharing.

Our entrees were the braised beef short ribs and the salmon.  The ribs were tender and flavorful.  The preparation of the salmon was very simple (seasoned and grilled) but was executed perfectly.  We had sides of pan fried corn and yukon puree and both were excellent.  The portion sizes of the sides were sufficient for two.

In summary, great food and great service.  Can be a bit pricey when you start adding sides.  But we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Joe took care of us at the bar very close to closing time. He was professional, attentive, and witty. Good beer selection, which he was also knowledgeable about. No good - kitchen was closed"}
{"text":"Decent meal after a show. The half BBQ chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The sides of spinach, corn, and butter beans were all pitch perfect.  Washed down with a decent IPA beer and it was overall a great meal.   

Considering the quality of ingredients, the location, ambiance, and service, the price seemed in line with other restaurants at this quality level. 

If you're seeing a show at the Belk Theater, this is a decent option that is close, has a varied menu, and isn't too pretentious."}
{"text":"Ordered duck breast and was a bit disappointed- asked for medium but was served well and entree was served room temperature versus more on the hot side.  Tried sides dishes of asparagus, mac and cheese and roasted beets- all very mediocre and again a disappointment:  beets did not taste roasted fresh, mac and cheese felt like frozen dinner entree and asparagus ends were not properly prepared and left too long.  Whole taste of food was not awful, care and preparation was very poor.  Would rather dine at other restaurants for price paid."}
{"text":"This was a really good restaurant/bar. We ate at bar. Food was delicious and healthy. The server was nice. They also brought out our food and knew exactly who ordered what. Will definitely be going back. Got the hanger steak and the special of collard greens."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Had the red snapper which was actually really tasty. Four stars because it needs a wow factor for a five star rating."}
{"text":"Um. Yes. Yes. And yes. Not only is the food phenomenal. But the service was AMAZING. I wish I could remember our servers name. She was a tall slender girl with dark hair and an accent. We sat outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. My girlfriend and I face judgement just about anywhere we go, we were a little worried about that here because of how nice the place was but we got NONE. It was such a wonderful dinning experience. We most definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere.  I think I just ordered the wrong dish.  I ordered a grill chicken salad.  I wasn't impressed. I don't like chopped egg in my salad and I wasn't expecting them. I may have misread the menu but salad was OK. My husband ordered a salmon patty special.  He was really happy with it. He found it just spicy enough to give it a nice kick.  I ordered sparkling water and it was tepid.   I expect really cold sparkling water especially for the price. Upon exiting the resturant, I saw some beautiful chicken dishes   I've eaten here with work folks before and I know there are much better dishes that I ordered.  Next time, I will order more substantially."}
{"text":"We ended up at Roosters after wandering around downtown Charlotte on a busy Saturday evening (due to an international soccer match). Although this wasn't our initial selection, I must say I'm happy we ate here. 

I ordered their special duck sausage dinner, which was served with house made kimchi and a side of flash fried cornbread cake. For only $14, this meal was amazing! Their regular menu was reasonably priced too. I recommend eating upstairs, as you get a nice view of their open kitchen."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last night. The bar was packed which made for a lively atmosphere. The server was friendly and prompt, and the bartender was awesome. Food is very tasty and well seasoned. Not sure if they serve dessert, because we weren't offered a menu, but the place had cleared out by then, so we were happy to head home."}
{"text":"$170 later and my brother is still starving having to go get a sub sandwich 

TINY portions , rude staff , out of half the menu at 445 ..... All in all a horrible experience. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS EXPENSIVE DUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horrible horrible ..... 


Such a waste of money"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here before seeing a show at the Blumenthal (which is conveniently located right next door) and sat at the chefs table looking in on the crew preparing dinner. The atmosphere was akin to Hells Kitchen, except for the loud screaming, crying or expletives with a British accent. Orders came in and everyone worked seamlessly to put out hot, delicious goodness. 

I had the seared scallops with wilted spinach and my husband got one of the nights specials - flounder. Now usually flounder doesn't make for a very thrilling dining experience, but this one knocked his knickers off. My scallops were buttery rounds of delightfulness that made me actually pause and enjoy each bite ... much unlike a normal American eater. To top it off, our server was Johnny on the spot with the check so we could get to our show on time. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Food is great , but between the annoying managers coming by to continue asking how my food is & the loud staff walking aimlessly around, I don't think I will be back ."}
{"text":"We were 2 couples in Charlotte for the weekend to attend a Panthers game. Roosters was close to our hotel and we were able to book through Open Table for the time we desired. The food was delicious, the server Gavin was attentive and offered pleasing suggestions. He hit a home run with the wine he suggested! Roosters is pricey, but we all agreed it was a wonderful evening. We were even reminiscing the following day.
As my dinner I had the Fried Oyster appetizer and a side of Roasted Beets. There were about 10 briny oysters with a small cup of cocktail sauce. The cocktail sauce wasn't needed because the oysters were so good. In fact our friends placed an order to add to their dinner once they tasted mine. My husband enjoyed the Housemade Pasta with Mixed Seafood in a buttery seafood broth with a hint of tomato. He loved it. In addition to their oyster add-on, our friends had the 1/4 roasted chicken, a dinner salad, and side of Macaroni and Cheese. The salad was so-so but the chicken was reported to be juicy and flavorful. Sides are offered a la carte to be shared family style. Although we ordered beets and macaroni & cheese as the only sides, they were sizable enough that we didn't finish them but wished we had been able to since they were delicious."}
{"text":"We went for girls' night out a few weeks ago & Rooster's was everything we hoped for & more. We didn't get our lives together to make reservations until that afternoon, but were still able to score a reservation for 8:30. We showed up at 8:15 & it only took a few minutes for them to seat us a little early. The ambience is great...rustic, yet upscale. Pretty good beer & wine selection, but the food is the star. We started with a cheese plate & then ate an obscene amount of food. I ordered the hanger steak, which was amazing. One friend enjoyed the roasted chicken pizza, another the mushroom fregola, and the last had the quarter natural chicken. Everyone raved about their dishes. I'm not sure how they can get so much flavor into that chicken, but it was juicy & delicious. 
As amazing as the main dishes were, the side dishes were just as good. We split the mac & cheese, potatoes au gratin & the succotash. They were all so good. My friend is obsessed with their green beans that weren't currently on the menu & she was slightly disappointed, but these sides were so good she got over it quickly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after a show at the convention center. Everything, and I mean everything was delicious! From the soups to the salads to the entrees and dessert. Everything was fresh, local and eclectic. The duck breast was the best any of us had ever had, and we are foodies.

Wait staff attentive, well-versed in the menu and preparations. highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom pizza and potatoes au gratin. Both were delicious. The crust on the pizza was very thin and crispy. The only problem was that the server didn't seem very interested in us. He didn't take the time to go over the menu and was generally hurried and short."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience.  I recommend the hangar steak and asparagus.... best ever."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to Charlotte restaurants.  It's consistently good and I really dig the Sunday brunch.  You can get some good duck confit hash action going  on here."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I have never had bad service EVER. Haven't been here since November of 2013 and our server actually remembered us and what I ordered. Now that's service. If I've said it once I've said it a million times....in this day and age you are paying a lot for the food you eat. Probably too much so with that in mind the service better be good too and the service at Roosters in uptown Charlotte NC has never been anything less they fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food and variety.  Great and timely service. Good value.  Everyone in our party of 8 enjoyed lunch."}
{"text":"Consistently fresh food, perfectly prepared.  Staff understands why they are here and are engaging, knowledgeable and pretty darn efficient.  Smoked wings appetizer is a win every day.  Had steaks (a prime ribe eye & a hanger) with a veal jus that was so damn good they should serve it in a 6oz wine glass pour.  Next night (yes, we did two nights in a row) both had the pan seared flounder on roasted root vegetables, and they nailed it: perfectly crispy skin and tender & juicy inside.  Wine list is more than one would expect and is very approachable from the price perspective."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant in close proximity to Blumenthal. The atmosphere was warm and cozy. The food and service were excellent. The best things we ordered were the onion rings, skillet corn and the lamb chops. I would recommend this restaurant for a date night or any special meal."}
{"text":"Great spot for date-night or any type of intimate setting. Has two floors and also kitchen-side seating if you like to watch your food being made. It has a more upscale feel, more for the working crowd or couples from what I gathered.

We had chicken thighs, broccoli rabe, mac n' cheese and mussels. Everything was what you'd expect from a French restaurant and there's no room for a diet here. I have to say the mussels were very tiny and a little underwhelming IMO (I'm a bonafide seafood freak) and I would refrain from ordering them again. But overall the food hit the spot in terms of heavy, buttery, cheesy cravings. We didn't have room to check the dessert menu but I'd recommend trying it - it's a French restaurant after all."}
{"text":"When I walked into the downstairs bar, I was surrounded by the \"beautiful people\".  Definitely a place to see and be seen.  The restaurant upstairs started relatively quiet at 6pm.  By the time we left around 8pm, every table was occupied and the noise level was a litte on the high side.
Dinner was the roasted chicken pizza, bourbon gnocchi and a salad from the day's special.  Everything was great, but the gnocchi was amazing.  I could have eaten numerous servings.  Dessert was a pumpkin ice cream sandwich - described to us as \"thanksgiving in your mouth\" - and the coconut cake.  Both were good but the coconut cake was our favorite.
Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love their food. It has great flavor that is closer to authentic than most in this town (Italian)"}
{"text":"This place is so expensive and for the price the food was terrible. \"This place can suck my left nut\" is the jist of it. 80 dollars for 2 people and chewy fatty duck breast."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant in downtown Charlotte.  We were lucky to get in.  Delicious pasta with shrimp."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 4 star for it's  location, ambiance, and service. Unfortunately, for most of us the food is the most crucial part of a restaurant. The fried oysters and duck appetizers were slightly above average. The calamari was way too greasy. I ordered the special seafood with trigger fish and it was way too salty. It was to the point that I could not taste anything else. Unless they improve the quality of the food I will not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Actually, want to give this 0 stars. I was asked to sit at the chef counter when I did not want to and they had about 6 booths open....ridiculous....will never step in that restaurant again."}
{"text":"First time at Roosters last night, I can say this place has some of the best food I have had in Charlotte. Beef short rib is probably some of the best I have ever had. Waiter was friendly and made great drink recommendations. Food came out way faster than I expected. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was fantastic! I ordered the pork shoulder and my date ordered fried oysters. The fried oysters were the best that I've ever had. The hospitality was also amazing. The manager was constantly patrolling and making sure that everyone was enjoying their food. Since it was my girlfriend and my anniversary, they gave us a complimentary dessert, which was a fantastic chocolate mousse. All around this was an amazing dining experience from the food to the service and everything in between. No doubt that I'll come back and done here again."}
{"text":"I ordered to go.
I got to glimpse the inside, which is rather cute - it has that chic, rustic/barn feel.
I wanted to love the smoked wings ($15) here - I really did!! I love wings in general (one of my go to bar foods) - and I like wings even more smoked or grilled!! However, they just lacked in flavor. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but I was just not impressed. I wasn't a fan of the ranch either. 
My friend enjoyed her salami and cheese pizza - personal size for $11. 
It might be worth another try..."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents out to Roosters this past Friday night. We were seated upstairs in the open area. I think it is really neat that the kitchen and fire oven is all open!

I thought the bottled wine list was extremely extensive, but the wines by the glass were a bit lackluster. I settled on a Paso Robles Cab glass of wine that was very tasty.

Throughout the night, we ordered various things that we all split. Cheese and basil pizza, side salad, mac n cheese, corn, gnocchi, and calamari. Everything we ordered was very good. The mac and cheese was phenomenal. I also really enjoyed the red sauce that was in the gnocci. The aoli served with the calamari was spot on.

Excellent meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh pasta dish, good service, and a casual atmosphere in the heart of Charlotte. I hope to go back to try more dishes on my next trip!"}
{"text":"My wife and I spent a weekend in Charlotte built around trying several restaurants of choice. Rooster's Uptown was the shining star. 

We had visited the bar on the prior afternoon just to check out venue but did not venture upstairs until the our dinner reservation on Saturday night. We had been viewing their menu on line and were pleasantly surprised by the second seasonal menu of the day.

We shared all of our selections including a roasted beet dish, and a seasonal salad that was a mix of fruit, and heirloom tomatoes, and while we loved it, can't recall all of the ingredients. I ordered the duck breast that was prepared perfectly medium rare with an amazing reduction sauce that our waiter said took a couple days to prepare.

My wife ordered the short ribs that she was thrilled with and a side of their Au Gratin potatoes. Great food at reasonable prices, attentive waiter, and a fun atmosphere centered around the open kitchen surrounded by counter like seating.

Loved Roosters!"}
{"text":"The service and food were excellent!  The staff takes care and pride in making your visit wonderful!  Order a main dish and share some sides!  I highly recommend the pimento cheese appetizer."}
{"text":"AMAZING food is out of your mind... fresh ingredients, local farms, so tasting that you can't stop eating....Brandy (our waitress) was beyond great"}
{"text":"Great dinner pre-concert. The BBQ chicken was out of this world good. Next time I'll ask for the BBQ sauce on the side as I felt it over powered the dish. I'm hooked on the white cheddar Mac n cheese. As for cocktails I felt the waiter could have spent more time with helping me make a selection. I wound up with a lemondrop martini that was awesome. All things considered the night was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I needed to take some business people out for a casual dinner and Rooster's was recommended. I need to say all of us were disappointed including the guests from Charlotte. We got a few apps. Meatballs were a special and were inedible! The bread had 3 pieces in the basket for 5 people. We had entrees from Chicken to steak to the burger. It was all fair at best!! We got many sides including fries, Mac and cheese, asparagus... the sides were fine. All in all it was not horrible but we all left saying we will not return. It was also not crowded and the bar smelled so strong of a cleaning solution we left and had drinks elsewhere.9"}
{"text":"Food portions are very small and come with no garnish or presentation. Quality of food was good but needs to be a little more exciting on the pallet. Scallops were very small for the price but we're perfectly cooked. Roasted chicken was moist. Great scalloped potatoes and Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I love the downstairs area. Bartenders are great, food is solid, drinks consistent. The parmesan mac and cheese is very good in small quantities. Always look forward to stopping in for snacks or dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food. Try the mac and cheese. Would definitely eat here again. Community seating was fun, met some cool people who sat next to us.Skip the blueberry bread pudding."}
{"text":"Rooster's is located in the 1 Bank of America Center building and boasts a lower floor bar area (entrance on S College) as well as an upstairs restaurant area (entrance at 1BAC, or through the bar and upstairs).  It's a well-frequented place by people working in the immediate area (i.e. consultants, Bank of America employees... etc).  It's a pretty popular place no matter what the day is because of it's convenience in the Uptown area.

I've visited on several occasions at this point as it is a solid place for a decent dinner.  They have a very large menu with items for people of all appetites and diets.  In particular, they have a large selection of cheese and charcuteries as well as meats.  Service is decent and the atmopshere here is great, especially for a business dinner.

I've had many of the things on the menu and the items that stick out are the charcuteries (so many to choose from and it varies daily), the scallops, which were perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the duck breast and hanger steak which was also cooked to the preferred temperature and well seasoned.  Also notable was the delicious mussels - the tomato-y garlic sauce was so flavorful and amazing you'll want tons of extra bread to soak it all up.  You honestly can't really go wrong with anything on the menu - I've tried other people's dishes and they were all great.

The star at Rooster's, however, is the coconut cake.  I'm a huge fan of cakes in general and I don't usually sway in the direction of coconut-flavored things, but the coconut cake here is amazing.  I've had it twice dining in and was craving it so bad one week that I even took one on the go to enjoy back at my hotel room.  It definitely tastes better when you dine in because they pour much more of the delicious vanilla bean sauce on it, but either way, it's great.  The cake is super moist and together with the sauce, it's amazing.  If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is a definite must-get.  The pecan pie (which I am also a huge fan of in general) was a huge meh for me.  

Solid place for an after-work happy hour or business dinner with lots of things for every palette."}
{"text":"Tiny a la cart entrees.  WAY over priced.  Don't know why Yelp shows it as a 2 dollar sing restaurant.  I paid 42 dollars for 2 short ribs (not 2 plates, 2 individual ribs) and a side of mac and cheese and one tap beer!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  A good place to go if somebody else is paying.  Tiny portions.  I wanted to laugh at the waiter when he brought my baby-sized plate of noodles, then I realized he was serious. This was my main entree.  The place smells wonderful with the wood fire and all.  If they'd only give you some food."}
{"text":"We loved Rooster's for dinner so much on a recent visit to Charlotte that we came back and brought a group with us. All the menu items we tried were amazing and included: the bbq chicken, the scallops, the duck breast, the potatoes au gratin, a pasta dish with a 3 meat sauce, the fire roasted beets and the asparagus. Every dish was excellent, an appropriate serving size, and prepared perfectly. Additionally, the service was outstanding. We had Adam take care of us. He was knowledgeable and attentive, and did an outstanding job recommending which dishes to try."}
{"text":"Went here before the Kid Rock concert. Service and staff was amazing! The food was phenomenal. I'm not sure what they put in the barbecue chicken but I'm dying to know. It was delicious!!! Amazing cocktails too! What a gem in downtown charlotte!"}
{"text":"I feel like I have to write a few comments about our experience at Roosters uptown on Feb. 15. It was a late Valentines dinner before a show uptown for us. When I entered, one of the first things I saw was that the restaurant inspection score on display was one of the lowest I have seen in Charlotte restaurant. I debated for a minute, then decided to give it a try anyway. We were seated promptly, but were seated at tables where the well-used  menus (with dirty fingerprints) were placed on top of our bread plates, not handed to us. I was truly grossed out, and did not touch that plate. I noticed that a table nearby that was reserved for a large party was set up in the same manner. I should have spoken up, but didn't. I'm not a germaphobe, but that is pushing the limits where public health is concerned.

Our server was very nice, but clearly inexperienced, and often no where to be found. It's the type of restaurant where I would have expected a little more training of the employees. Our food took a really long time, and our server did not keep us updated. We were early, and most of the later arrivals were eating before we were. 

I had the chef's special salad of the evening, which was very good but the dressing was a bit salty. My hanger steak was well prepared, but presented naked on the plate. My dining companion had the ravioli with short ribs, which he found to be well prepared, but a bit on the small size. In both cases, adding a little something to the plate would make you feel like your serving size was adequate and improve presentation.

Not sure if or when we'll try Roosters again. My low score mostly reflects slow service, sanitation and presentation of the food, not quality, all of which are easily addressed."}
{"text":"Been here several times and food is always great.  We had calamari as app. And duck and hanger steak for our entrees.  Sides we ordered the succotash and au gratin potatoes.  And of course the coconut cake for dessert.  Everything was perfect!  We went on a Wednesday night and I was glad I made a reservation cause it was busy.  Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers.  Nice upstairs location with cool old wooden decor and hogheads and roosters decorating the walls.  Good menu selections of meatloaf, chicken, pork BBQ, turkey sandwiches, etc.  The veggie sides looked good too like fried corn, but were high at $6 each.  I went for the Carolina BBQ sandwich with slaw and pommes frittes, simply quite good.  My buddy enjoyed the turkey salad, and the other enjoyed his smallish pizzette/pizza.  The only one disappointed was one who ordered the chicken salad, which came out like a wedge salad (half a head of lettuce in the middle of the plate and smallish ingredients scattered on the edges).  Bottom line, nice place for a slight splurge for lunch in a nice setting."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been too in a long time. Is it a bit pricey? ... sure... but it's quality food. I will make it a point to come here again next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Found it through the review sites and when a large group of us (8) decided to grab dinner after a pep rally for the Belk Bowl we headed here.  We were lucky to get it.  They were crowded and we lucked into a large table downstairs in the bar area.  We had everything from appetizers and salads to a burger, a pizza, and some really good entrees at our table.  I personally had the Beef Short Rib and it was spot on.  Great flavor and the glaze on it was exceptional.  I also tried a piece of my wife's Mushroom Pizza and it too was quite good.  Good beer selection and the drinks were good.  Drinks were a little pricey to me but I'm not familiar with the standard pricing and tax rates on alcohol there.   I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Ate at the chefs counter overlooking the kitchen, very cool. Very clean and efficient kitchen. Pork chop came out undercooked but entire staff bent over backwards to recover and they did. Lots of Manager attention. These folks know what customer service is about. A customer for life. It's all about the customer service."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times before performances. I was never blown away, but it was convenient, and the menu offers variety--useful when dining with friends with a range of dietary restrictions. I will not be returning, however, because of the owner's politics. See link. Because Mr. Noble would like to be able to refuse service or employment to someone because of their sexual orientation, I will spend my money elsewhere. https://goqnotes.com/56133/charlotte-city-council-member-announces-boycott-of-new-restaurant-over-owners-anti-lgbt-views/"}
{"text":"I went with some friends after being in town shopping. I was told this place was off the chain. I can say this I shall not be back. Did not eat food took one bite. I shall not be back."}
{"text":"We went to Rooster's in uptown on Saturday.  We decided to stop for dinner because of the wonderful smokey smell as you walked by.  Kevin and I split the smoked wings and potatoes au gratin.  The wings were awesome as, were the potatoes - nice and cheesy!  

Another member of our group got a half bbq chicken, the smell was amazing, I want to go back to try that.  Someone else ordered the chicken and mushroom pizza, he said that was wonderful.

Service was good!  We went in as a party of 9 without reservations and they were able to seat us downstairs.  Drinks and food came out pretty quickly with no problems.

I give Rooster's 4 starts just because it can get a little pricey by ordering a la carte.  I look forward to going back - and/or trying the location in South Park."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here and it's a good place to eat but I'm giving it a 2 star review because I drove Here intending to eat here and in the mood for their food and they closed an hour early because they were slow."}
{"text":"Rarely do I write reviews, good or bad, but this place deserves to be properly elevated not only for an amazing food menu, but for a fabulous drink menu, a cozy, comfortable, unassuming atomosphere, and thoughtful, considerate and amusing wait staff. 

Our table had the braised short rib, salmon, burger, mac n cheese, potatoes au gratin, and kale salad, all of which were seasoned to perfection (not very salty, which I prefer) and sufficiently sized portions.  We also tried a couple of their desserts, which were pretty good, but I'm not big on dessert...I'm big on the main course, which was delicious!

Maybe I got lucky, maybe not, but I will definitely be going back to Roosters next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The environment and service was great. I love the rustic feel. However, the food was oversalted and not that inspiring."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere - went for lunch and beat the rush. Fresh and targeted menus which I like, and I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. The were creamy and had a good smiley flavor on the shrimp. Pecan pie for dessert, I recommend it.

I would love to try it again for after work or dinner - seems like it would be a good vibe."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service! We were in Charlotte for the weekend and happen to step into rooster's for some great bites, local brew, wine, and service. The oysters are to die for, while the meat and cheese tray finalized our impeccable experience. Server was knowledgable and experienced. Highly recommend for ambiance, service, food and wine selection"}
{"text":"Amazing hanger steak and mushroom risotto or something. Basically everything everyone had at the table was fantastic. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The au gratin potatoes are sinful.   I can't even begin to explain the best potatoes ever."}
{"text":"I had the hunger steak, it tasted like beef jurkey...and the portion size was really small.."}
{"text":"Ordered the duck and the iceberg salad. The flavor of the duck was great! Although it was chewy for cooked medium. The salad was ok. This is my second time eating here. My preference is the second floor dinning area vs the downstairs bar area."}
{"text":"As I sit in what is perhaps the overflow space through a public hallway across the main restaurant, the overall experience compelled me to write this review.

Imagine being seated in a place so dark, devoid of energy, compounded by drab music, that you lose your appetite. Good luck reading the small  font menu in  this light. As if the management doesn't really want you to be able to read the menu! I've been to funerals that were far more exciting!

The bread basket . . If you are going to serve complimentary bread, at least make sure that it's at room temperature if not warm. Our bread felt cold, gummy, and hence, wasteful.

We ordered French Onion Soup which was pretty good. Duck mouse, good texture but super chilled where it felt frozen and no seasoning. Polenta and Peas, mediocre. Polenta had soaked up a lot of flavored oil and tasted strange. Duck confit . . great dish if prepared our several hours where the meet and bones acquire the texture of a jam. Our order was prepared by someone who had never had the real duck confit. A leg quarter at KFC is far more tender than what we were served. Based upon the experience so far, we decided to cancel rest of the order and leave.

What's interesting is that almost all dishes were removed half eaten and yet, none of the waiters bothered to inquire why that was the case.

Bottom line . . Rooster has the potential to be far better if the management paid attention to quality control, actually tasted what it was serving, and ensured that customers left with a uniform experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful place in Charlotte!  Portions are perfect, staff is sweet and attentive, ambiance is lively .  Food is very good.  Even though I was there at an odd hour for them (3pm for lunch)..they welcomed me and the owner himself poured me a beer and made sure I had everything I needed.  Highly recommend this place if you are staying nearby from out of town or just want a classier break from the sports bar scene."}
{"text":"Good pizzas and daily specials. Love the beets. Tasty.
Mac & cheese and chicken are poor. 
Good beer selection. Great daily specials at the bar.
Main bar tender is a tool. He has real attitude. Brought a few people here and they all agree. 

Other staff are nice, particularly the support waiters."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!  The food and ambiance here were great. My friend and I were immediately seated for our 8pm reservation.   We sat on the second floor inside.  The short ribs were paired perfectly with potatoes au gratin. They were sooo tender and succulent.  My definite choice next time! My scallops were cooked perfect and I chose polenta as the side. We both shared the spinach, but weren't impressed with it (we both agreed we could have made it at home).
We didn't have dessert because we were going somewhere else later. Overall,  i loved Rooster's and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I found Rooster Wood-Fired Kitchen to be ... acceptable. Nothing spectacular, several mis-steps, food was OK to good, but not out-of-this-world. I'm holding this place to a bit higher standard than a typical casual-fine-dining place for two reasons. First, I was a customer of Noble's back in the day, and recall the exquisite food and service there. Second, at the rates they charge, it ought to be perfect.

Ambiance: 4/5, but not what I was expecting.
I disagree wholeheartedly with Aubrey F's characterization of this place as \"romantic\". It would be more well-suited to a large group having dinner and drinks than a romantic dinner. Large, noisy, open dining room with the kitchen in the middle. They use what is almost certainly reclaimed local wood as part of the decor. That's great, unless you're wearing a sweater and keep sticking to the side of the booth whenever your arm brushes it.

Service: 2.5/5
The best way I can describe the service is \"muddled fine dining\". Between the service and the food, it felt like a restaurant that had been open for a few weeks, not since March. We ordered a cheese plate appetizer, a soup, and two entrees. Here's how that worked: The server came by and asked what kind of water we'd like; water arrived quickly. She came back and asked if we were ready to order; we said we'd like the cheese plate, but weren't sure about entrees. The cheeses arrived within two minutes - really amazingly fast! We ate the cheese, leisurely, and were almost done when the server arrived to take our order. We placed the rest of the order. The soup arrived so quickly that I kind of pictured a very eager soup chef, ladle in one hand, HOVERING over the soup, ready to spoon out a bowl. Then a good 15-20 minutes passed before our entrees arrived. The gap between ordering and entree wouldn't have been so bad if she'd taken our order shortly after giving us the cheese, and if they'd held the soup a bit. The result of the service was we had \"cheese...pause a moment...soup....wait and wait...and wait....entree\", where it should have been \"cheese, pause for a bit, soup, pause for a bit, entree\". 

Food: 3/5
The food was okay. A basket of wheat bread with a nice tasty olive oil showed up pretty quickly. The cheese plate - our \"selection of 3\"  - was delicious, and the high point of the meal. It was served with ... oh, I don't remember the name... thinly-sliced bread that had been toasted over the wood fire. Delicious. The tomato basil bisque was also very good. The entrees and side-dishes... My wife had the hangar steak. It was tender and well-seasoned, though she found it a bit salty. The fingerling potatoes were good-but-not-great - roasted sliced fingerling potatoes with just a bit of golden-brown crust on them. I had the pasta with squid ink, squid, and scallops. The good: The flash-fried scallops were delicious. The sauce had a lot of flavor to it, and the pasta was perfectly al-dente; the squid (so easy to do wrong!) was perfectly tender. The problem, again, was the salt level. It was almost bad enough to mention but not quite, that sort of \"this is okay but I wouldn't get it again\" thing. 

All in all, I found Rooster's to be adequate, nothing special. And I kind of was expecting something special, so I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot really show you  how excited I am that Roosters has opened there second location Uptown!! 5 minute drive from my house as opposed to 25 minutes and this place looks great!!

We actually came in on opening night and while it wasn't packed it had a good crowd and the service was great!! The food was awesome like usual and the decor was so shiny and new!! We sat downstairs in the bar area and then went upstairs after dinner to just see what else was going on, they had a beautiful open kitchen and great booths! This is going to be a great spot to hit for a fun Saturday night or happy hour! 

We started with my FAV's the Duck Ham and Aged Guoda- if you haven't had either you need to now!! We also had the fried oysters which I've never had before but they were really good and was a good amount! Then for our entree we had the Hanger Steak-again a favorite and the Duck Gnocchi which was another new dish to me it was great the Gnocchi was cooked perfectly! We paired them with the Hericot Verts and Mashed Potatoes- the mashed potatoes were really good I had to stop myself from eating the whole dish, seeing as I was \"sharing\"! 

For desert we had the Toffee Cake which I have never had and that was D-licious!! Management was great they were all so happy and excited about being open which in turn made us excited to be there!! I can't wait to be back in town so I can go back to my new hangout!! I just hope the staff doesn't get sick of me and my friends ;)"}
{"text":"Wow. Went to Rooster's for lunch and had the oyster salad. A generous portion of gently fried oysters atop salad greens with smokey bacon, balsamic dressing and bacon dressing on the side. IT....WAS...AWESOME. Ridiculously good. My friend had the grilled meatloaf topped with tobacco onions (fried onions) with mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed spinach.  It was awesome as well. I can't wait to come back for dinner and try other dishes! Cozy, rustic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a co-worker.   Love the modern, wooden decor and open space.  I had the open face BBQ Pork sandwich, with fries, coleslaw and corn.  My friend had a three vegetable sampler platter.  Both were very good.   The service was good.  Quite busy for a weekday lunch period.  

Feel this is a solid 4 star location."}
{"text":"These guys are doing something!  I love Charlotte and where the food is going, but for now, a lot of it seems pretty similar to me.  There are some huge exceptions and these guys are one of them.

You can come in through the front door downstairs or in through the Bank of America building upstairs.  The downstairs entry leads you straight to the bar and is great for a quick bite.  However, I prefer the upstairs, where I can see the open kitchen.  You can see it all, foodies rejoice!  You can see and even feel the wood fired ovens, if you sit close enough.  These chef's can obviously take the heat.

As far as the food goes, we ordered it all.  The waiter knew off hand where many of the ingredients came from.  First, I tried a beautifully crafted BLT.  Kind of funny because they pretty much share the Ritz with BLT steak.  All smokey and crunchy.  A must in my mind.  Then, superb shrimp and grits.  Next, a cool play on bahn mi done NC style with sous vide pork shoulder and house made pickled veg.  Smoked and spice rubbed chicken wings that put pretty much any bar in Charlotte to shame.  Even the meatloaf was taken to the next level.  The sweet potatoes were a perfect match.

I don't have anything bad to say, I love this place.  If I was a banker still, they would see me 2-3 times a week.  I can not think of another downtown restaurant that I'd recommend over it if someone asked."}
{"text":"***Rooster's specializes in meats roasted and grilled by fire and the end results are satisfying as the kitchen achieves crispy and smoky sears to go with rich and moist meat; Rooster's also has upscale notes in the design of the dining room as well as their non-meat choices like a good variety of cheeses and macaroni and cheese that is not infused with truffle oil like a lot of places but instead topped with a fresh shaving of summer truffle***

Rooster's is a meat and poultry centric restaurant in Downtown Charlotte.  They specialize in their proteins grilled or spit-fire roasted and you can definitely tell fire plays a large role in this restaurant as several of their BBQ meats like pork shoulder reveal a great smokiness while their grilled duck breast combines a charred and crispy skin with a rich, moist and red center.

Of the meats I tried, I liked their duck breast the most.  It was simply prepared and seasoned, but the incredible char they were able to achieve on the outside of the duck breast gave it a great smoky flavor.  The juiciness was also excellent.  It was one of the most well prepared duck breasts I have had to date.  The grilled hanger steak was also good but did stand out compared to great hanger steak preparations I have had at other restaurants.

Rooster's also features an impressive variety of cheeses including good goat cheese and blue cheese choices.  Sides are served a la carte here and their goat cheese with arugula and peaches salad was fine, but the most satisfying side was their macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy but also had a crispy, lasagna-like crust.  For the macaroni and cheese, they also offered an option of summer truffle shaved tableside (at a very reasonable cost) and the summer truffle was quite fragrant and pungent.

Service was very good and friendly.  Prices were not too bad.  At first glance, prices might seem high here since the preparations appear to be so simple, but the quality of proteins is very noticeable as Rooster's meats are well marbled and the high heat from the fire allows the fat to evenly melt, which provides a soft, juicy and very flavorful experience.

Rooster's has a contemporary dark wood dining room with large booths.  The booths are definitely designed for big crowds given that meats and sides here are served a la carte to allow for easy sharing.

Rooster's was the best dining experience I had in my limited stay in Charlotte.  The food was prepared with skill and care and there were enough Southern touches like pimento cheese and pan fried corn to make this restaurant feel unique to the area.  I think Rooster's is definitely a good option for an upscale and satisfying but not too pricey dinner in Downtown Charlotte.

I do not know what the parking situation is in this area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The duck breast is simply amazing. Every time I'm in Charlotte I try to make it by here. Great craft cocktails, good wine selection, attentive service with great personalities. For a while the duck was hard to come by but, like any great restaurant should, they acknowledged the problem and looks like they've straightened it out. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Our waitress was inattentive as well as condescending and rude when we had questions on the menu. The food was overpriced for the mediocre taste as well as portion. I paid 12 dollars for 4 pieces of calamari.....and 15 for gnocchi that was rubbery and lacked flavor. I was extremely disappointed with my experience. Not sure why people seem to love it here. Waste of my time and money.  Also, it took our waitress 15 minutes to get us drinks and she didn't even think to apologize for the wait.....when you go out to eat you are paying for an experience, I have food at home I can cook, I got out to eat to be treated with outstanding service and amazing food. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, modern and trendy. Burger was great. Our waitress seemed to be in a bad mood, though it didn't slow our service she wasn't pleasing to be around which is a downer. Door was drafty."}
{"text":"Such a lucky find among all of the downtown Charlotte spots. I was in town for a wedding and wanted something non-chain for lunch and found this place. Went wth two friends and we were all impressed. The mac and cheese was unlike any Mac and cheese I've ever had- it was so different but SO GOOD. The duck confit sandwich was great too. And I got a Bloody Mary that was delicious as well. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My first experience was for lunch. The scallops were perfect... the dish was the perfect size the peas and broccoli made me nervous but once I had the first bite I was pleasantly surprised. The combination was delicious .... 

The pimento started and wings are a must have.
Now let's talk about the hibiscus tea.... I'm sure I had two cups and took two packs home. The fries seem house cut and we're great. I went with a group so we kind of just ordered everything. This is my GM's favorite spot she's here pretty often and I can tell you why the food is just amazing. 

I'm excited to go back and try the coconut cake I've seen pictures"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for months and I'm sad to say that it did not live up to my expectations.

First off, the space is incredibly beautiful with vintage wood, a beautiful open downstairs and bar, with the quaint, cozy, intimate restaurant setting situated upstairs. We had two waiters come up to us and pour us water and serve us bread without saying a word. They poured the water and walked away. I had to ask what the server's name was, as I thought he was our restaurant server, and then he mumbled something about \"weed.\" The second server brought bread to our table but said nothing. I was shocked at the lack of personal touch to this point.

Once we met our actual server for the night, I posed a few questions about food options on the menu. The server wasn't very helpful and just said everything I asked about was \"excellent.\" He wasn't able to describe flavors or what makes it excellent, which made my ordering decision very difficult. We started with a glass of wine and craft beer. I did enjoy the variety of wines and beers on their list. We skipped the appetizer and I went with the seasonal flounder, while my husband ordered the pork chop. By the way, sides are a la carte. I'm actually not a fan of this at all. I like dishes that choose sides that complement the flavors of the dish. It looks awkward serving an entree, such as a piece of fish or meat, on a large plate all by itself. That's just my opinion, but I don't prefer it. I ordered the grilled beets while my husband ordered the mac n cheese. The flounder was probably one of the least memorable fishes I've ordered. I was disappointed in it's lack of flavor and seasonings for $30.00. I wasn't impressed. My husband's pork chop was better. The mac n cheese was my favorite part of the meal and came with a crusted layer of cheese on top, which was to die for.  We enjoyed the pace of our meal, but the service was just eh, overall. 

I'm rather disappointed in the overall experience after having high expectations for this restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Rooster's is casual and cozy with attentive service. There is a bar area on the first level of the restaurant with TVs and a larger dining area upstairs. 

Rooster's boasts an American-style menu with lots of options from charcuterie plates to pasta, salads and flatbreads to protein-based dishes. There's also plenty of side options including potatoes, mushrooms, and other vegetables. I like that the menu can be tailored to lots of different needs - you could treat it like a small plates menu, ordering a number of different dishes and trying/sharing everything, or you could treat it like a more traditional menu, where you order appetizers and then a protein + side. Note: In my experience, the portions seem to be sized as if it is a small plates menu. 

I ordered a pick-up order to take back to my hotel room for dinner (the quarter roasted chicken + haricot verts w/ garlic + a bottle of sparkling water) and was surprised at how quickly my order added up to ~$30. The chicken looked and smelled delicious, but there was a slight burned taste on the crispy skin which took away from the chicken itself :( The haricot verts were very fresh and crunchy with lots of garlic on top (mmm, garlic), but there couldn't have been more than a cup or two in my to-go container. I could have eaten an entire bowl of those things.  

Rooster's is a little on the pricey side, but it's a decent restaurant in Uptown if you are looking for some fresh, American-style food."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Rooster's on NYE before the Widespread Panic concert around the corner at the arena.  It has a great location to grab a bite to eat if you're going to an event there.  I have a friend that was a chef at the South Park location for a few months, but I never dined there.  The food was pretty good and I wish I would have tried it out sooner.

We shared a 3 cheese plate, she had a salad, and I had the steak burger.  The cheese plate was was a great way to start off the meal.  The Gouda was my favorite as it had a great smokey flavor.  Each cheese is about $7-8 per 2 oz. serving, but you can get a 3 cheese/1oz. sampler for $13.  I can't say much for the salad, I only took one bite, but it was fresh with a nice light vinaigrette.  My burger was great though.  It was cooked perfectly and was very juicy.  It had a ciabatta bun over a traditonal one.  I think a traditional bun would be better suited in my opinion, but the meat is the most important part and they nailed it.  It came with a choice of side and I got the mac & cheese.  The sauce was creamy and it had a nice sharp flavor.  You can order from a choice of 3 different cheeses and I went with cheddar (server recommended the cheddar over the other choices).  The burger w/ side was $10, pretty reasonable.  I didn't see a beer list, but I tried a local Charlotte brew that I haven't had before.  That's always a good thing.

The service was great and I had a good meal in a cool open kitchen atmosphere that put me in an awesome mood to ring in 2013!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken sandwich lunch special with mac and cheese. It was delicious. The mac and cheese was perfect! My boyfriend got a hamburger that had some kind of aoli on it that was phenomenal. My son got kids pizza and he loved it. The staff and waiter were very attentive and friendly. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a coworker. We ordered the wings which were very good starter. For dinner we had the red snapper which was the days catch it came with okra green pepper and black eye pea risotto. It was delicious the black eye peas had spme snap verse being mushy. Then we had qtr chicken with spinach and onion rings. Every was great. However most of the items were alacarte. We did have a peach bread pudding which took 20 mins to cook but the wonderful server we had gave us advance notice so we were able to plan accordingly.  We went on a Monday at 5pm however by 6pm this place was packed."}
{"text":"I went to Rooster's for lunch and we were all very disappointed. They must not have prepared well, because on Monday they were out of a lot of menu items. After three of my top choices were out, I settled on the iceberg, bacon, blue cheese salad. It is listed that way on the menu, but it is actually just iceberg with bacon topped with blue cheese dressing. The bacon was overcooked. My server didn't come back after dropping the food off for 15 minutes, by which time I didn't have any more time to order another item. My friends fries were cold."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory drink after we finished taking national boards down the street. Not a bad place to meet for drinks in the downstairs bar area, not sure how upstairs is. More of an upscale bar. Different menu for lunch and dinner, came during lunch but wanted more of the dinner options /= They said they couldn't do dinner yet, boo. 

FOOD
Scallop Salad (4 stars): Scallops cooked perfectly!! The salad itself needs a bit more work but the scallops make up for it.

Mac 'n cheese (3.5 stars): Very cheesy. Too much for me, needed something else to balance it out. 

Spit Roasted Vietnamese Pork, Daikon, Baguette (4 stars): Lots of flavor, really good sandwich and meat! 

DRINK
Moscow Mule (3.5 stars): Didn't get served in a copper cup =/ Too much lime also. Not sure if they knew how to really make this, bartender said he did but it wasn't on the menu. Try to stick to the menu.  It wasn't very strong either. 

ATMOSPHERE (4 stars)
Sat downstairs at the high top tables. Looks pretty nice inside, open windows so you can people watch.  

SERVICE (3.5 stars)
Everyone was nice, but a little slow. Got a drink menu in the beginning then after ordering drinks was left with no menu, so had to flag someone down for that. Maybe there's better service upstairs but there wasn't very many servers downstairs."}
{"text":"We came in from out of town and picked this place based on the Yelp reviews.  In this case, Yelp got it right again.

I fretted over the menu for about 20 minutes because I honestly wanted to try everything.  In fact, I'm sad that I don't live in Charlotte because I'd keep coming back here until I tasted every last item on the menu!

I had the short ribs, my partner-in-crime had the BBQ chicken.  At first I preferred the chicken, which was much more than just a standard BBQ chicken.  I'm not sure what magic they work on those birds, but I'm not a big fan of \"plain old chicken\" and they took theirs to a whole new level.  I'd definitely recommend going for that if you're going to eat there only once.  As I kept eating, I began to truly appreciate my short ribs.  They melted in my mouth and had the perfect little micro salad and sauce to keep it interesting and utterly delicious.

As for the sides, I wanted every one of them but we settled on the corn fest: roasted corn, succotash, and fingerling potatoes.  The succotash was to die for, and so was the corn itself.  I liked the potatoes a lot with my short ribs but my friend was not a fan.

Great highlighting of local beers, but I wished they had more than just IPA and hop overload.

I'm giving the place 4 stars because of the service.  According to their website, the place was booked solid and we nabbed the last reservation (at 3pm!).  We found to our dismay that we were the only ones there.  It was very awkward and frustrating to be sitting in an empty restaurant and being blatantly aware that we could have showed up at least an hour later and it wouldn't have made any difference.  I think the waitress could have handled a bit more than two people.  The place was empty as we were leaving and finishing our meal."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner while in town for one night for business. Excellent selection of local craft beers, very helpful waiter in picking out a top notch charcuterie board, and an absolutely life changing duck breast with roasted corn. Seriously, no exaggeration, THE best Duck you could ever possibly hope to eat. What an excellent dinner in a trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant was picked based on our group winning the competition we were in today.  We had a choice of 8 restaurants and this one had the best Yelp reviews.

After a short walk (less than a block) from our hotel we arrived at the restaurant.  Since we had reservations, we were immediately taken to our table.  Table location was kind of funny, upstairs and outside in an area beside the stairs.

We had multiple wait staff due to group size.  I found all of them to be both friendly and informative.

We ordered multiple appetizers and drinks.  One of the appetizers was a meat and cheese sampler that was awesome.

I ordered a flatiron steak and scalloped potatoes.  I have to say, that due to the size of the side, I had to share.  I think everybody agreed that the potatoes were the hit of the meal.  

The steak was small but prepared well.  I like my steak to be more flavorful than what I was served.  I would probably order something else if returning.

Would I return?  Without a doubt.  We had a great time and I would like a second helping of those potatoes:-)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on New Year's Eve. Place wasn't super busy. Got reservations through open table. No parking one street so we parked in the garage. The hostess validated our parking. 

When we arrived we were immediately seated. Tables are upstairs but the downstairs bar looked nice. It had a nice fire burning too.

At the table, service came quick and with smiles. The waiter was very friendly. 

First out to the table was bread and olive oil. We ordered a cheese plate ahead of the main courses that didn't disappoint. I'll be hunting down the Snow Camp and Chocolate Lab cheeses.

Entrees came out shortly after. We had the half bbq chicken and a hanger steak with fried beets and potatos au gratin on side. The hanger steak was perfect. Highly recommend. It looked small at first but after having with bread and potatoes I was stuffed."}
{"text":"We came here in November of 2012 on my first ever trip to Charlotte. My wife and I have been talking about moving here ever since. (That has more to do with Charlotte, not Rooster's, though we did love the restaurant.) We finally moved here a few days ago and I am looking forward to going back. 

The night we went, there were four of us and I believe Madonna was in town at the arena. We were told that we wouldn't likely get a table anywhere in town if we didn't have reservations. We ended up at Rooster's and sat at the chef's table. We could not have had a better experience and I would strongly recommend sitting up there if it's a busy night and you want a low-key dining experience.

One quick question to all the people saying, \"the portions were too small\": You do know that this place is served as small plates, right? They are supposed to be small! And typically at restaurants that offer small plates, the more premium items tend to be a little small. This should not be a knock on Rooster's specifically, but more on the way small plates are done in this country.

What I do remember was that all of the food was fantastic and the drinks were great. We had an absolute blast and like I said, we'll be back soon now that we live here!"}
{"text":"Went to Roosters downtown with friends for drinks. The waiter was rude and condescending. When I went to pay for the drinks they charged me an extra dollar than what the menu said for each drink. The  atmosphere however is very laid back and chill. Overall I would say proceed with caution when visiting this particular location."}
{"text":"Simply an amazing dining experience. 

The first floor is mainly a bar area with high tops, and the second floor is the actually dining space with an open kitchen. The lighting was soft, romantic, with classy fixtures, great place for a date! 

I ordered a quarter dark-meat chicken with nature flavoring, and a butter wilted spinach on the side. The spinach was rich in flavor, and it just melted in your mouth, so good! The chicken, to my surprise, was very flavorful and juicy. I guess that's the beauty of a wood-fired kitchen! 

My girlfriend ordered a steak burger with pomme frites (aka French fries). She ordered the steak burger medium well and it was cooked to perfection. The sauce came with the burger was spicy, almost tasted like wasabi in flavor. The fries had some sort of special house seasoning that took it to the next level. 

For desert, we shared a toasted coconut gelato, and it came with a very soft sugar cookie. The gelato had a mango flavor that blended in very well with the roasted coconut, and the cookie was soft and a wonderful addition both in presentation and in taste. 

Last but not least, absolutely great service! Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself at Rooster."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in an otherwise sleepy area. The interior has a dark wood theme and smells like barbecue. I got the roast chicken, which was very good. The first floor is an informal bar area with a few communal tables, but there's a larger dining area upstairs. Our waiter was very friendly. 

(The restaurant is attached to the Bank of America headquarters, so going to the bathroom requires leaving the restaurant and walking through sleek corporate corridors, past eye-scanner security devices, into the BoA bathrooms. Pretty crazy.)"}
{"text":"Nice place, good atmosphere, decent food .  The flounder was very good.  Pricing is very reasonable. A large selection of local beers."}
{"text":"I had a simple light meal at Rooster's and it was great; some of the best mac n' cheese I've had to date.  I found Rooster's on my last day in Charlotte as the menu was varied and interesting.  I will be back on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Nice setting and presentation of food. The menu was a bit weird to read as it really didn't explain how any of the dishes would be cooked. Our server was nice and explained everything so we were able to make good selections. The food was good, but I felt everything was on the salty side. The mushroom side, asparagus, steak, and even the chicken wings were a bit heavy on the salt. I wasn't the only feeling that way; everyone was chugging their drinks. It was a pity as I thought the rest of their food was great."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best short rib I've ever had with amazing sauteed mushrooms. Great atmosphere & service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I do not rate 5 stars very often but Rooster's earned every one of them.

From a fantastic daily menu to a wonderful (and reasonably priced) wine list to impeccable service, the entire meal was perfect.

We had the heirloom tomatoes with Mellon and speck to start.

For our dinner we had the five choice charcuterie and three choice cheese platter.

Everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Had the duck confit and potatoes au gratin and my wife had the short rib. They were all incredible - the meat on both was tender and flavorful and the potatoes creamy. The smoked old fashioned was superb with the chartreuse board; we were able to pick out local cheeses and meats which were all exquisite. We finished off with the coconut cake and some coffee which was very good. Our server was very helpful and prompt with everything and didn't rush us; he let us tell him when we were ready to order the appetizers and then waited till we were done to put in our order for the main meal which I always appreciate. Will come back next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try their food  because I was too busy ordering coconut cake.  By too busy I mean I ordered 2 orders *heavy sigh* lol.  The cake was sooo moist and full of cocunut flavor and coconut flakes.  It really gave me tres leche vibes with coconut.   If the food is anything like the cake, you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Rooster's is one of my favorite treats in South Park - this is the Uptown location, so I decided to try it.  Back in the day I used to love Noble's in South Park (same owner/ exec chef) but alas, it is no more...  they had the most amazing duck two ways and sweet potato brûlée...  

enough about the past though..

So Rooster's is awesome.. the Fried Oyster Salad is amazing and the tomato basil bisque  is yummy.   They also have the best coffee...  

Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! No drinks for 20 minutes the food arrived just after getting our drinks. Hello that is restaurant 101!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First-timer, will definitely be back. Bar service was a bit touch and go at the beginning but the guy I ended with was legit. The calamari was mehhh-ish, had to do a lot of dipping w whatever the side sauce was to get it down. Wasn't a \"push away & wait for the main dish\" event, but I only kept going because I was hongry (no typo). Main dish was flounder, small portion but perfect for my appetite. I don't mind smaller portions with the a $20+ price tag as long as it's good and filling, which this was both. Great wine pairing recommendation - so all good there. The butterscotch brownie... yeah man. Like that dish is on my list of \"fiend-dom\". The only reason I told them to package it up in a mini-to go box is because I wanted to draw out the experience another day. Yeah man.... that's all I have to say about that (channeling Forest G.)"}
{"text":"This place has a great upscale dining experience but super friendly: charismatic waitstaff (shout out to Keith for making my friend bachelorette dinner so fun!) 
Stand outs were the calamari and the spaghetti with homemade sauce. 
I didn't particularly like the house wings which were very salty or the kale Cesar which was also overly salted. 
We got the pineapple cocktail (forgot the name) which was way too sweet! We switched out for a nice red instead. 
The Stars were more for service than food but really that is what makes the best dining experience!"}
{"text":"My third visit and I can't seem to order anything else but the spit-roast BBQ Chicken, Succotash, and the Amazing Lemonade!!! I always seem to to get great waiters or waitresses which always makes want to do a return visit."}
{"text":"Great food.  Had a grilled chicken salad.  Was amazing but I didn't love the pickled  veggies. Very pricey lunch."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow and food is uninspired - an overall disappointing experience.  Skip over this place for somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Great food- loved the location too! Great wine & Beer list as well! Make reservations or you will wait a long time or sit in the bar area, which we ended up doing and it worked out fine anyway."}
{"text":"Food was plentiful and tasty the cheese appetizer was really good also had the Moscow mule that was very tasty"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I ever had filet with crab meat on top when I finish It i was mad that I ate it to fast but it was so good"}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday with a party of 12 and they sat us in an area outside, which we had all to ourselves (which was really nice!). I love the atmosphere of the place, everyone is so friendly. I found the menu to be quite confusing, and the everything is overpriced for what you get. We ordered a TON of food so I'll break it down for you:

First off, everything is overly salted. The best thing we got was the Fried Calamari as a starter. It was too salty though, but very succulent! The salmon was too blackened, making it very dry. The smoked wings, although good, were also very salty. The mushroom fregola is delicious! One of my faves, for I have never eaten anything like it. And the mushrooms are huge which I loved. The pei mussels were very good as well! The sauce it was in was a little bit watery, if it were thicker, it would've paired great with the bread it comes with. The mac and cheese was too bland. The cheese was not very strong, and the sauce was noticeably runny. Some items were just a hit or miss and I did not leave with a full stomach. I didn't love anything, but the service was impeccable. Our waiter, Grant, was great!"}
{"text":"Visited Rooster's after work on a Tuesday night, and boy am I glad we did. There was an extensive wine list and lots of local brews. For starters, we ordered some eggplant dish that was beautifully presented and tasty. Definitely a good way to start off. The real fun, however, came with the main meal. My personal favorite was the short rib, which you could cut with a fork and had great flavor. The duck breast was simply grilled and yummy, although it was a bit rarer than I would have preferred. For sides, we enjoyed a healthy dose of mac and cheese and some pan-fried corn. The m&c was classic and creamy, and the corn was even better (that's code for \"drowning in butter\"). I'd go back any day of the week and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place when I decided to make reservations here for my fiance's birthday. We had walked past this place many times and always said we'd try it one day. The potatoes au gratin were delicious. Otherwise the rest of the food we ordered was all right, but nothing that I'll be dying to try again."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weekday. If you enter from the N. College Street entrance, you have to pass through the bar area and up the stairs to get to the host stand. The entrance on East 5th Street requires that you enter through the Bank of America building and go up the escalator. There are beautiful mounted roosters above the host stand and the restaurant has dark wood and is dimly lit.

I had the hanger steak ($17) and the bf had the salmon ($17). We ordered the au gratin potatoes ($7) and the pan fried corn ($6) for sides. Everything was delicious and perfectly portioned in my opinion. My bf was in love with the au gratin potatoes. They were cheesy and had an uber yummy creamy taste to it! The service was good and the food came out with little wait. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a farm to table restaurant where everything is clean and fresh. Their succotash is amazing, and the best Mac and cheese (all apps). For meat lovers there are all flavors of BBQ with pork, chicken, beef, brisket, etc. there is also a gluten free menu.  Great service.  Must try."}
{"text":"Rooster's offers good farm to table food including seafood, vegetarian and meat dishes. The ambiance is cozy inside the restaurant or there are tables in the atrium which give a semi feel of outdoor dining (without the elements). 

The food was good, however they were out of several items on the menu by the time we got there at 7:30pm. I feel like I almost need to go back to try out the items I wanted. 

As a colleague summed it up, \"it's farm to table but some things get lost along the way\". They were out of the special fish, the duck breast, asparagus and the coconut cake (three of these I wanted to order, two of which I ordered and then was told they were out). The waitress seemed defensive when we joked about the fact several items weren't available. 

The restaurant would be better served to have a slightly smaller primary menu and a few more specials to have better availability (or quite honestly raise price on some items to keep them stocked). I understand that you run out of specials from time to time, but asparagus?"}
{"text":"That must fear here was quite cozy. Don't let the bar downstairs for you, they have quite a lot of room upstairs. We had the half chicken and scallops and split a bottle of wine. Nothing was completely over-the-top, but it was a different way of cooking with the open fire cooking style. The scallops were a little smoky for my taste, but they were prepared as you would expect. The desserts look amazing, but we did not taste them. We would revisit again."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends during a convention visit to Charlotte was wonderful. The ribs and wings were outstanding. 
The service was super friendly albeit not as knowledgeable as one might expect from a seasoned waiter."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Charlotte we visited Rooster's for dinner. I had the grilled salmon and was very impressed. It was perfectly seasoned and had a wonderful smoky grilled flavor. I also had the kale caesar which was quite tasty. I'll definitely be back when I visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant was amazing.  It is a little hard to find, but worth looking for as their ambiance and food is divine.  It reminds me of Cochon in NOLA.  The whole meal was a divine experience that I should have written about immediately after so I could remember details.

Make reservations as it is always busy.  They have nifty craft cocktails that are yummy.  I would not recommend this restaurant to a vegetarian.  

This is a great date night."}
{"text":"I would prefer to give them 2.5 stars but I'll stick with 3. We (group of 11) have a reservations at 8:30 on a Saturday night. Maybe it's a bad idea. Seated on time. But for the amount of time to order and when to receive our food was over 35mins. I love our waitress but I can see she's overwhelmed and all over the place. It doesn't seem like they're staffed. They're staffed enough buss boys and assisting waitresses but the actual waitresses was truly under staff. It took forever to get our food. She couldn't get to us fast enough to fill our waters and my coffee. I would think they know better for a Saturday night! 
Now food.. I can't complain in that Dept. When it finally arrive which is after 9:20pm. I was starving at this point was beyond yummy. I ordered the Hanger steak (medium well) perfect seated crust! The Mac and cheese was comforting. And their greens hit the spot. 
After dessert, we can't track her down for like 15mins to get the checks. We didn't leave the restaurant til way after 10:30pm when we're anticipating a 2hrs dinner event!"}
{"text":"The first time was amazing. I decided to bring my whole team here as a thank you. The food is made with love! It's the food that is worthy of your last meal on earth. The place you take a woman you're courting prior to proposing. If you're looking for a dinning experience, and something worth your time money, come here!"}
{"text":"I went this location because of the recommendations. Unfortunately if you aren't part of a corporate event or going outside of business lunch hours this is not the place to visit. The food is OK, but I also expect a decent level of service. 
After being seated by the hostess, we waited 10 minutes, finally getting up and asking the hostess to send a waiter/waitress over. We were seated on the first floor and the restaurant was not that busy. The last straw came when we asked for the check and we waited 15 minutes for someone to run our cards. Finally giving up my friend walked to the Epicenter, pulled cash, received change, walked back, and they still not had come back. Meanwhile I was trying to get some attention to no avail. We paid exact change, leaving the restaurant I tried to bring it up to the Hostess- she didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"The ambience and service was great. They have a decent selection of beers and wines. 

However, the chicken was way over done. I was surprised since this place specializes in chicken, and it wasn't just me, but all my friends had the same complaint. Not sure if it was a one time thing, but i dont know if I'll go here again."}
{"text":"This place is great. Loved the chicken and the open faced meatloaf sandwich"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Natalie was our server and she was amazing, request her if you can. I've been here for work and for a date and for all occasions this place is the place to go. If you sit upstairs you can sit by the open kitchen, pretty awesome to watch. I've only tried one dish that I wasn't a fan of, short rib I believe (too fatty for me). Everything else is delicious - mushrooms, ny strip steak, hangar steak, pan fired corn, Mac n cheese, and you have to try the coconut cake (make sure you save room!). I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here recently with a group of 9 on a Thursday night to celebrate a birthday.  At first when entering the place looked dead on the first floor bar area where you enter.  Once we were led upstairs we realized pretty much all the tables were full.  The place stayed pretty busy until we left at around 10.  I really liked the decor and feel, rustic but still modern.  Most of us in the group had been to their other location so we knew pretty much what to expect.  However this time we all agreed that the food was better than we remembered.  I think that is a great sign for a second location that hasn't been open long.  

Service was pretty good, they gave us time to order and the food came out pretty quick.  We had been drinking so we were a little loud and slow but it did not phase the staff much.  There were a couple times we needed something and it a look a few minutes to find one of the two people helping our table, but we didn't mind.  

All of the food I tried was well seasoned/sauced and cooked nicely.  I started with a special for the day, fried green tomatoes with rock shrimp.  The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce tied everything together well.  For dinner I had mussels which also tasted fresh and were served with a broth that was real good but I can't remember what was in it.  I also got the opportunity to try the hanger steak which was juicy and accompanied by a tasty sauce, the wings which are always solid, and the dessert given to the birthday girl, a coconut cake which was quickly consumed by everyone.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat uptown. The food is always prepared to perfection - and all locally sourced. The pork rinds are served in a huge portion, and the wings MIGHT be the best smoker wings in town. They really take pride in serving a great meal to every customer, and the rotating daily specials are top notch. A very casual atmosphere means it's a great spot to grab a bite and a drink before whatever uptown event you have."}
{"text":"Very fresh and very good food. We went back in our anniversary and loved it at this location. A little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Rooster's Uptown continues to satisfy and impress on several levels.

The upstairs ambience is a favorite part of this restaurant. If you can be seated in a booth closer to the door leading to the bathroom, you can feel more private - which I prefer. 

The staff I've dealt with during my last 3 visits has been knowledgeable, helpful and agreeable.

One of the lighting devices was aimed uncomfortably into our eyes (possibly from being cleaned), so we asked, and a server climbed up and re-directed it for us right then.

The food is fresh and tasty, and the servers tend to give detailed descriptions and answer questions in a professional fashion. I have always trusted their recommendations, and am always satisfied.

My order generally consists of a charcuterie plate with a bresaola and something close to prosciutto (I ask which current meat is closest to it), then 2 cheeses - also depending on the recommendation of the server and what they are featuring. Depending on appetite, a Barbee arugula with apples & chevre salad and maybe another item can suffice for two. Again, the special salad and meats must be taken into consideration. These often make the meal.

The drink menu is designed to appeal to specific tastes and is manageable. The Queen's Cup - a play on the Pimm's Cup - can even be made with vodka per request."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The kitchen appears to be filled with very talented people who can keep up with the demand of everyone there. Our waitstaff was cordial and the front of the house was stuffy. Highly recommend placing a reservation and repeating your visit to try new things. Not overly dressy and comfortable. Somewhat loud but not too load that you can't have a conversation. Well done to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food was seriously delicious and pretty healthy fare. Service was prompt and friendly. Prices are reasonable. We had the smoked pork shoulder and a half chicken with pan fried corn roasted beets and butter wilted spinach. 3 of us ate for less than $60 including tips. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Roosters for New Years Eve dinner. They were very accommodating to our large group and reservation was ready when we arrived on time. The restaurant has a slightly upscale feel but no need to wear a suit to dinner. The taxidermy on the wall and the open kitchen made the atmosphere very entertaining. As a group we ordered several sides and all of them were great and easy to share. I got the pork belly which was just added to the menu and it was unbelievably good. The highlight of the dish though was the sweet potato purée. The BBQ chicken was also a great choice if you are looking for something with more traditional southern roots. One of our party member ordered the hanger streak and it was unevenly cooked. That is the only negative I have for our time there. Service was great and we left full and happy."}
{"text":"Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \"ok. Have a good night\". Thats it. We won't return."}
{"text":"So I've tried the location in South Park and I was not a fan. However it was late after a show at Blumenthal and we were hungry and they are right there so we decided to have dinner here. I have to say this place was so good. My BF will forever love this place because they have a mushrooms, campo de montalban pizza. Campo de Montalban is his favorite cheese in the world and can be rather hard to come by. He saw this and he was done lol. It helps that the pizza was amazingly good as well! The beef carpaccio was really good as well. I got the steakburger which I can't complain about. Won't rave about it but it was good. Overall I have to say we'll definitely be back after our next show!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good wine, and delicious food! Highly recommend the charcuterie sampler and gnocchi with duck."}
{"text":"This is a common lunch place.  I made the mistake of having a spring mix salad.  Why was this a mistake?  The stems were still on the greens & it was a challenge.  I was concerned w/every bite that a stem was hanging out of my mouth or classic stuck to my tooth.  I'm challenged as it is to find a menu item at Rooster's to eat & now it seems even more so.  Generally speaking the steak or chicken are equivalent of other places & I try to find a version."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! As we walked down College Street we were tempted to change the plan and duck into a couple other places we passed, but I'm glad we didn't. As soon as we got close to Roosters we could smell the woo-fire on the street. We were instantly glad we had carried on.

The atmosphere downstairs was cozy and inviting. They took us upstairs to seat is and I was afraid the second level would lose some of the charm, but it did not. In fact, the open kitchen is the feature of the second floor. The atmosphere and our server were absolutely fantastic. 

My wife had the Hangar Steak and Au Gratin potatoes. The steak was good, but the real star were her potatoes. We highly recommend!

I decided to try a few things, so I got the Duck Wings (daily special), the Beef Summer Sausage, and the Fire Roasted Beets. All were good, but my favorite were the beets. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. If you like beets, get these."}
{"text":"I had a very strange experience with this restaurant. I actually started dinner at the \"sister restaurant\" Kings Kitchen. They had a horrible situation happen where the kitchen flooded and they had to send us to Roosters. The manager at Kings told us that everything would be taken care of due to the fact we had already waited an hour for our food and now they couldn't serve us. Roosters was about to close so we ran several blocks. 

They said they were excepting us. All four of us ordered the Short Ribs which were out of this world fantastic. We had two sides that were ala carte. We enjoyed a bottle of wine as well. Finally with happy tummy's the manager brings us the check. It was the full amount spent... We were quite confused since we were told it would be taken care of. Then the manager offers to take care of the side items. I was quite embarrassed at this point to be asking for the manager to take care of our meal when that had already been promised since the overall experience had taken several hours to even get dinner. 

I truly think there was a miscommunication from Kings to Roosters and the manager ended up taking care of it. I was simply very embarrassed to have to ask them to do what they said they were going to do. Roosters was quite a bit more expensive than Kings so we most definitely would not have chosen to take friends here on a double date since it wasn't in the budget. 

Overall the food and service was amazing. The situation we had was very rare and uncomfortable. I would absolutely return to Roosters for a nice evening out, that is when I know what I'm getting myself into."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was great!! Hand tossed pizza severely overlooked. The burnt \"crust\" (if you can call it that) completely drowned out any favorable flavor of the toppings. Cool venue though."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food.  Calamari and pizza apps are spot-on, I think the calamari is one of the best in town. I had the scallops and duck dinner, cooked to perfection. A little pricey but worth it, for a very nice evening out."}
{"text":"Quick update. Came for a Wednesday lunch, and I ordered the Steak Burger. Last time I came I had their INCREDIBLE Vietnamese Pork sandwich, which my buddy Jeff ordered today (he LOVED it!). 

Unfortunately, when I got my burger, I got yet another Depleted Uranium (DU) bun. Well, ok. This time it was Titanium. I showed my waiter the heft of this bun, and I said if I had pirhanna teeth I still wouldn't be able to eat it. Sad part is that I remember getting this hard bun a year or so ago....maybe they kept it that long???

OK, the Waiter and Manager attempted to make this right. They took my DU Burger and put in a new order. Right call. The Manager asked if he could get me something while I waited for my new order. He brought me out some grits with bacon. Sounded yummy. Unfortunately it was average at best. Grits were not fully cooked (or maybe they were just designed to be texturally stiff?). Could have used more flavor...I left the majority of that \"snack\" on the table.

Burger took a long while to come out, but it did, and it was better. Look the bun was softer the second time around....but it's still a dense bun. But I don't understand why this Jim Noble restaurant insists on using HARD BREAD for their burgers? Note to Rooster's Management: USE SOFT BUNS! Try Brioche.....Cowfish uses Brioche buns and they make their burgers ROCK! Nothing like butter and burger....it's a match made in heaven!

So this rating is for their burger. Waiter and Manager tried doing the right thing. And I appreciate that. But using hard buns just don't work for me. Hard to believe since they make such delicious, fresh bread at King's Kitchen. I mean, they have an awesome, soft bun for their Vietnamese Pork sandwich. Why not use that Rooster's for your burger? My mouth (and teeth) would be SO much happier! Yeay."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for dinner. Passed by Rooster's every time going in to park the car.

From the outside it does not seem like much. Do not be fooled as you walk in the entrance. Bar area with several screen TVs to catch the latest sports game. Fire place so warm and inviting on a cool night. There is a whole dining area next to the bar.

As you head upstairs to the dining area, the aroma as well as the smell from the kitchen hits you. Inquiring minds want to know- What is Today's special?

The pasta are freshly made and you can not go wrong.
Mac n Cheese delicious as well as the Burrata.

There is an extensive menu like 2-3 pages on a clip board.

Had the duck confit which was very salty.
The short ribs and beets were also too salty.

Will definitely be back for the pasta and happy hour.

Very attentive waitstaff."}
{"text":"After many dinners/drinks here over the years I guess this is the last. The menu is so vague and full of itself, that the waiter had to give a monologue on what everything meant and what was missing/hard to understand. This was BEFORE we where asked about what drinks we wanted. Is this a tapas? Is this an entree w/ sides? What's the portion again - 1oz on this and 2oz on that? We were as confused about the menu as we were listening to the server give the 5 minute rundown on the what was really on the menu. The menu only has the name of the dish. No description of how prepared or anything. Our table was left shrugging shoulders and just hoped for the best. My past favorite, the Short Rib, was far different, and inferior, than it was a dozen visits before. :(  Lastly, they need to up their cocktail list for those who like to try new concoctions. What happened to your delicious Basil Cocktail? (brought over from Good Food)."}
{"text":"Went with another couple which was celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.  It was special.  The menu has a lot of different offerings.  Quite surprising to us, but a wonderful surprise.  Very nice wine list with variety and many wines by the glass. Service was superb and the plates presented well.

Salads were generous enough for two, so think about that so you can save room for more.  The bar was a full one and cocktails were the norm, so if you want to try something your \"heard about\" or just wanted to experiment, this is the place.

I had the most delicious short rib ever.  It was BIG, tender and so tasty that I almost lost most of it to the other three diners who regretted that they had not ordered it themselves.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Truly yummy.

One of the others ordered the tomato bisque soup and mussels.  So-so was my judgement, with the mussels rather flavorless in a watery tomato liquid.

The assorted mushrooms that I ordered for an appetizer were superb.  Sooooo flavorful and a good portion that went a long way as they were too rich to gobble down with a big spoon.  

Wife ordered a special which had those same-o mushrooms and a small balls of pasta which looked like beans but were not.  The pasta was fregola. That meal would have been a good appetizer as well.  Wife took license to steal some of my mushrooms for good measure.

The other couple ordered the special scallops.  We were all rather stunned to see the presentation of four, only four nicely browned scallops plated with some garnish.  Barely an appetizer and not so special.  I passed on taking a taste as the portion would have robbed them of a good bit of their meal.

Dessert was a beautifully obscene coconut cake, but not just cake.  Crème Anglaise and Chantilly cream were artfully layered with the cake, making it necessary to drink strong coffee so you could refresh your palate to eat more. I am not a dessert eater, but giving in to the table that night was well worth reconsidering my passing, no dessert for me attitude.

Shame we did not try what Rooster's is know for, which is their spit-fired roasted chicken and pork.  Next visit."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this place and I went there after reading so many good reviews. I was excited to order the Scallop Salad but when it arrived there were three very small scallops on the plate. The arugula which took up most of the space on the plate had no dressing, but the part which made me return the salad was that the croutons were rancid. Really rancid.

The other thing I had was the Shrimp and Grits. It was not bad, but it was so extremely salty!

On the other hand, the atmosphere was nice and the service was great.  I just wish the food lived up to their looks and prices."}
{"text":"So the chicken is delicate and lovely especially if you crave salt. I had both bbq and just roasted and recommend the roasted. The mushrooms are incredible and recommend them with confidence. I would not recommend the grits as I found them to be undercooked and a weird combination of bacon and corn (I know should have rocked). Everything else is really good, but if you are salt intolerant this is not the place for you. Good service but not great.....you can get ignored once waiter moves on so get everything you want when 1st ordering..... even a second beer can at times be difficult.  Child menu is okay and does have some kids food, but suggest to order off regular menu. Manager or hostess rocks very helpful. You will like this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service at the bar!  I had the hanger steak, au grated potatoes, and corn and everything was 5 stars!  Amazing flavor!

Great beer selection as well and the staff was top notch!"}
{"text":"My opinion, I think this place is overrated. The food is okay but there has to be more to a restaurant than food. Our server was nice but far from being point. She wasn't there half the time when we needed things for our table and she was very difficult to summon.I ordered the beef short ribs alacart plate and half the meat was fat. For the amount you're paying for the plate, the chef should have had that out before it got the table. The dick confeit was okay really didn't blow me away. My opinion, this place is hype. The location is great, the ambiance is nice but for me that was it. I'm glad I came but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Rooster's.  You can tell the kitchen staff has a passion for food and wants to make people happy, and you can tell that the front of house staff is well trained.  Unfortunately, pretty much everything was overpowered by salt.  The wings were too salty, the steak was too salty (and over cooked as well), the only thing that wasn't too salty was the pees, which were excellent.  Overall, I was left disappointed.  There are too many places that do this type of food really well, I'm looking at you Soul gastrolounge, for me to throw good money after bad at Rooster's"}
{"text":"First time dining at the uptown location and second time dining at a Rooster's overall....this location is just as great as Southpark, and has the added benefit of being in the midst of the city's downtown energy. The beef short rib was phenomenal and cooked perfectly tender. The succotash side was also well worth it...who knew lima beans could be so delicious? Can not wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, superb service. We left our phone and card to catch a flight and our server came running around the corner to give it back to us. Talk about going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were visiting UNC Charlotte and had dinner here last night. The food was delicious. BEST short ribs ever!! The meal was amazing as was the service. We were looking for suggestions to shop after and the staff were so helpful. The manager is superb!! I wish they had this restaraunt in Boston!"}
{"text":"Shared the spaghetti and a small pizzatta. The spaghetti was such a small portion with no bread on side. Not worth $10. Pizza was like it was of the box.  For this type of restaurant you can go to the frozen section of the grocery store and get a better meal. Service was good.  Will give them that."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and every time we have been seated out in the atrium (party of 6).  It's super awkward sitting out there. There's no music and it's you with 3 other tables. Maybe that's where they place the bad kids ;-) 

Anyways, the food has been pretty good. I've had the mushroom pizza (awesome), the assorted mushrooms (guess I love mushrooms), the Mac and cheese (yummy in my tummy) and the steak burger (jaw dropping). My favorite has been the steak burger, which my husband and I split.  It was cooked to perfection and had the best flavor. Plus it was only $13 and came with the side. FYI the onion rings are bomb! I haven't tried the chicken yet (which I think is the signature item), so I'll above to try it next time. 

My only drawback to Roosters besides our seating arrangement is that they are sometimes out of items because it's farm to table. When they are out- they are out. Last time I was there they were out of the scalloped potatoes, asparagus and broccoli. I was really craving the potatoes which was a let down."}
{"text":"If wood roasted is your passion, this is your place! Our group enjoyed a wide variety of dishes along with some apps. The people that had the roasted chicken thought it was good, but found it to be light on flavor. They do not serve the chicken with any sauces. It is a simple wood roast preparation. Again, they thought it was good, just not quite what they expected. I had the wings and loved them. So if you like your wood roasted chicken with a little kick, go for the wings. Everyone that had the beef entrees thought they were excellent. Service was a bit slow like when it was time for drink refills. And we were all a bit surprised how long it took to get our entrees. But nothing too crazy. The menu can be a bit overwhelming. I would suggest a bit more explanation of some of the less well known/southern items. That would help streamline the ordering process. We all had questions as we ordered."}
{"text":"I was a fan of Jim Noble when I lived in High Point.  His restaurant was on the cutting edge in the 1980's.  Sadly, the quality and flavor of his dishes has fallen short of those days.  Also, the waitstaff is rude and aloof!  I will not be patronizing this establishment ever again!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice and the second time was not good. I got the shrimp Po boy which was served on a hamburg bun. Yes, a Hamburger bun that was thick and dense with about 8 shrimp on it. First of all a Po boy sandwich of any kind should be 1) on a roll and 2) over flowing. You must be wondering why these are the requirements for this sandwich?  Well let me tell you, the roll with its crease holds the over flowing goodness that's inside. They should have a disclaimer on this overpriced sandwich that states; beware that this sandwich is literally a Po boy b/c its inspired by ppl that thought a Po boy should have as little filling as possible to represent the disenfranchised shrimp lover. 

***fries were good"}
{"text":"What a great find. Here on business walked down college street- was able to grab a seat at the bar. Hanger steak and Carolina rice were great! Service was terrific too! Finding the downstairs restroom was the biggest challenge."}
{"text":"Braised short ribs to die for. It is in the Bank of America 3rd floor atrium. Use the stairs to get ready for a meal you will not leave hungry from."}
{"text":"Lunch at Rooster's makes my week - for one very delicious reason:  the vietnamese pork sandwich.  It's an amazing variation of banh mi - and it's done soooooooo well.  I really could wax on about this sandwich for hours - that's how much I love it.  The meat is so tender, the veggies crisp and the sauce - d-lish.  

The upstairs portion of the restaurant is cozy and perfect for lunch meetings or romantic dinners. The downstairs has a pubbish feel to it with communal tables and a bar.  The service is always top-notch."}
{"text":"We chose Rooster's Uptown because of the reviews and the proximity to the Belk Theater.  We started with kale caesar salads, and chose hanger steak and the pork belly special served with black rice and root vegetables as entrees, and the pan fried corn as a side.  Everything was well prepared and delicious. We enjoyed the ambiance, the attentive service, and the convenient location.  Our dinner was a bit expensive, but there are plenty of less expensive options on the menu."}
{"text":"I like you roosters. Mussels, potato au gratin and malbec were all pretty damn tasty.

You're good for groups, so much to share. you're good for vegetarians plus you have a solid burger and steak. Cocktails. It's one of those places that's you're afraid sell too much diversity. Somehow all is good. 

I'm a fan. If this was in NYC, you couldn't a get a table. Maybe you can't in charlotte. Sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this star, but it's my only option. I made a reservation in February. We showed up 10 minutes early and were told we couldn't be accommodated because the party before us was late. We waited in an extremely unaccommodating lobby while everyone stared at us while they ate. We stood there for 30 minutes after our reservation time with no acknowledgement of the inconvenience or any kind of comfort while we waited. We were on a strict time schedule, hence the reservation, and this restaurant had no respect for our timeline."}
{"text":"I've been to the Southpark Rooster's Wood Fired Kitchen location more than one time, and loved it!  Tonight, just before heading over to see Roger Waters perform The Wall, we stopped in for dinner at Rooster's uptown.  I'm very glad that we did!  The meal was excellent!
So, what an evening!!  Great concert preceded by a great dinner!  When we arrived at around 6pm, the bar (downstairs) was already full.  Fortunately, my brother had arrived a little earlier and managed to get a table without a reservation.  Look, don't press the luck too far here - this place is popular and it does fill up!!  So, if you can find time, make the reservation!!
The menu is basically the same (or very similar to the menu at Southpark. My brother had one of the specials,  a Tile fish dish.  I decided to try the BBQ Chicken.  For sides, we had beets and another special squash dish.  Everything was excellent!  The BBQ chicken was tender and flavorful!  I would order it again,  for sure.  Actually choosing a side was a little difficult, because they have some great choices available!  I've had the mac-n-cheese and pan-fried corn before - both excellent!
One more big plus to note, is that Rooster's has a great beer list with several local craft beers available!  Of course you can get the others, but I really enjoy trying local beers and to have so many choices, is great!  I had the NODA Brewing Company Ramble on Red, and I would recommend that too!
The service was excellent!  We had a very friendly, helpful, and professional waiter that never kept us waiting.
So, it's nice to know that this fine restaurant now has two locations in Charlotte!  I'll be back - to both, I'm sure!!"}
{"text":"Nice location. Parking Deck parking. Make sure to tell your server about your parking pass. And they will take care of it"}
{"text":"Really a lovely place to enjoy a meal.  Great atmosphere and service.  Potatoes Au Gratin are best ever."}
{"text":"Our first visit, my husband and I celebrated our one-month anniversary here and we will be back for sure!!!!

The BBQ sauce is made from scratch and is by far the best sauce I have ever tasted and I'm not a BBQ sauce fan! It felt like there was a party in my mouth with every bite of the delicious BBQ chicken. 

My husband ordered the beef short ribs and it was so tender that it just fell off the fork as he ate it! 

Unlike the negative reviews about the service here, we had the best service experience! Almost everyone who worked at the restaurant whether our server or not asked us how we were doing and if everything was good. 

We live dangerously close to this place and can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was really good but the service was terrible. Wish I was able to give 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible, we made reservations for 8:30 finally got seated at 9. First I must say that u need to validate your parking in the restaurant so don't forget that! We went to the bar since our table wasn't ready and no one had any idea about wines almost felt like I was bothering them. We got seated and quickly a teenager came up to our table with an attitude like AGAIN we were bothering him, he never said hi, I had to say hi. He came up and literally put a bread bowl on our table then poured olive oil in a plate no seasoning no nothing. Apparently u get cold olive oil with your cold bread. How thoughtful of them I think that was all it took but then the bathrooms are very far away from the restaurant I felt just stupid for coming here. All the hype, l just feel stupid waiting for the table then to feel worst about the teenager serving the cold ass bread. I was shocked that the restrooms were so far for such a high end place. I was so disappointed and then I guess the GM realized we were leaving she asked to comp our meal, that in itself told us everything sorry but I just didn't think it was worth it at that point."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte - both for lunch and dinner. The upstairs is a great because you can watch them cook your food right in front of you, but the downstairs is awesome as well for more of casual dinner and drinks. The salmon is my favorite dish!"}
{"text":"Rooster's is legit!  We stopped in here sans reservation prior to a show across the street at Belk Theater.  We parked in the deck right there at the restaurant where they validate, which was an added bonus.  Walking in, we found a really cool vibe, combining rustic with modern and urban.  There was a bit of a wait so we took a seat at the bar.  Had I reviewed the other Yelp reviews beforehand (shame on me) I would have realized that reservations are HIGHLY recommended here.

When our table was ready, we were led up some stairs to a big dining area we had no idea even existed!  (Side note: there is apparently first-come first-served seating available up there that they don't tell you about at the front.)  The menu had all your southern classics with modern twists on them.  The mains are served a la carte and the sides are family style.  If you order one of the daily specials, as we both did, you'll find that they come with their own sides.  I got the pork chop.  This was a big azz piece of beautiful meat, bone-in, tender, juicy, and buttery (almost too buttery).  It was served on top of this bean and green situation which was equally delightful.  

Only thing that kept me from going fiver on this one was the service.  We didn't see our waiter much and he didn't explain anything on the menu until we asked him directly.  At a nice place such as this one, you expect your waiter to offer specials and explain things that are unique about their menu.  

This is definitely a spot we'll return to!"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday night dinner with my girlfriend.  We showed up around 8 after she got off of work.  No regular tables available, so we settled for the kitchen bar (which is great for two people who want to see how food is made!).  We split the roast chicken, the beef short ribs, and the beets.  Beef short rob was great - fell right off the bone!  The chicken was nice and tender (we got dark meat), and the BBQ dipping sauce was mind-blowingly awesome (LOVED the chili kick it had).  Beets were OK - more my girlfriends thing than mine.  Would definitely come back and try roosters again!"}
{"text":"Good choice for lunch, dinner, and/or drinks. I've had the burger for lunch at a colleagues suggestion. Not what I would have naturally gone for here, but it's a winner. For dinner the vegetables are excellent."}
{"text":"I'm averaging out this review to 3 stars.  I had a 2 star experience for my birthday but my friend convinced me to go back tonight and it was 4 stars. 

First visit:  September, I got the pork belly 'special'  It was terrible.  AWFUL.  The sides were good, but the main meal was nasty.  The pork belly was rubbery and about the size of an art eraser and served with a juice that was not very good.  The whole meal was just bad, and it was my birthday.  They did comp me a piece of coconut cake with a candle....but the meal, i was pissed.

Second visit:  I got the quarter BBQ chicken.  It was delicious.  This is what both of my girlfriends got the first night and why they wanted to go back tonight.  It was well seasoned and delicious.  As with our first visit the sides were also on point.

So i'm going to average this review out and my tip to any future patrons would be to give the specials a very wary eye...they may be good, but they may not be.  Might be better to stick with what they do best."}
{"text":"So disappointed today at lunch. No chicken was available for half of things on the menu.. They ran on of chicken.. Just a wow to a five star restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is five stars!! We had early reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived at a nice booth upstairs. Our waiter was FANTASTIC and so patient, as I was the \"I don't really drink liquor I don't know what to get\" person! I told him what I liked and he brought out a fabulous cocktail for me! We started with the olive bowl which was splendid, the purple ones are the best! I ordered the steak, with potatoes au gratin and OMG they were heavenly. The steak had a great sear, great flavor and was cooked a perfect medium! My husband got the burger which he said was divine! I also got a really nice glass of wine, everything was just perfect. Wished we lived closer so we could go back!"}
{"text":"If in Uptown Charlotte, the Rooster is a great place to go for a trendy night out. Upon entering you're greeted by a host, who will direct you to a seat. 

I sat at the bar, which is a great choice for a business traveler such as myself. The bartenders were courteous and helpful. They helped me figure out what was the best course of action for dinner. They also make a great Old Fashioned (no sugar cubes but rather with orange and cherry muddled). 

Food was great. I had the fried okra, pork shoulder and grits with bacon. Everything was served quickly and were all savory, warm and boasting with flavor. Keep your eyes peeled for specials after 4p only at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's a a good place to go to with people who like to share because the menu is full of great stuff you don't want to miss. 
I had the scallops which were the best I've ever had, and I order scallops often! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. 
My table shared a cheese board then split two different veggie side dishes. Everything was incredible. 
I had wine but the cocktails also looked amazing. Definitely recommended! Not cheap ($$-$$$) but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Was celebrating a friend's birthday, and appreciated that the hostess and server acknowledged it, and when we ordered dessert, they put a candle and special decoration on my friend's. Everything at the table tasted great: short ribs, mushroom pasta dish--forgot the name, cheese board (tasty but skimpy on the bread to spread it on), fried okra (terrific), wedge salad, specialty drinks. Servings aren't huge, esp given the prices, but service was friendly and attentive.  A good special occasion place for us."}
{"text":"I ordered the pep pizza however my family all ordered various other meals that all looked fantastic. I had food envy for each of their plates. The pizza was great, small and flat bread but enough to fill you up. My family all loved their meals as well. Prices were reasonable for the food portions and quality."}
{"text":"Roosters is one of those kind of sure, it can't miss restaurants for romantic evening, social luncheon or business lunch meeting. Some of my personal favorites dip and corn Butterbean which brings out the country boy in me and their grilled-chicken chicken absolutely superb. Bruce is always also does an excellent smoked BBQ which leaves a trail down the street luring people to it. The definite crowd pleaser and many repeats coming from me."}
{"text":"We came on nye to get some food before heading out to ring in the new year. The food was moderate. Our service was very poor. I heard people mention good things about this restaurant but I failed to find really anything great to say about it. We got the hangar steak and fries. Our portions were small and that was part of the problem. Maybe I'll just order charcuterie and wine next time. I would recommend for a great dining experience. Mainly just for after work drinks."}
{"text":"Roosters is wonderful for a gourmet, southern-style meal. Once you step into Roosters, it feels as though you've stepped into a modern barn which just so happens to be chock-full of delicious food and an amicable wait-staff to serve you said food.

You meal begins with steaming hot, freshly baked flakey bread and warm delicious butter. My bread is soon followed by the various sides I ordered which included the fried corn, and asparagus. I must say, the fried corn was my favorite dish of the meal since it was seasoned to perfection, and ultimately had me begging for more when I was finished."}
{"text":"The ambience was amazing as was the wonderful wait staff!  The food was good, but a little heavy with the butter and oil."}
{"text":"Meh. That's how I feel about this place, and you know my review is honest because I didn't pay for my meal!

As part of my job as a catering manager my boss asked a few of us to check this place out for lunch to see what sort of competition it was.  A free lunch?  You don't have to ask me twice!

We headed down about 1:30pm on a Wednesday and there were a total for 4 people in the place besides us.  The kitchen is totally open so you can see your food being prepared which I thought was cool but the chefs I was dining with didn't agree.

I ordered the salmon salad in an attempt to be healthy and also because it sounded good.  It came out quickly but lacked all the \"stuff\" I want in a salad.  On the menu it said roasted peppers, green beans, grilled salmon, blue cheese and lemon vinaigrette.  The salmon seemed like it was from a can, there was one roasted pepper, 2 green beans and 3 chunks of blue cheese.  The vinaigrette was more like lemon scented olive oil and I had to ask for more to coat the salad.  No good.

My coworker ordered the chicken sandwich which looked good and the fries were tasty, someone else ordered the shrimp and grits and they enjoyed it.  The service was good and it smells like a campfire in there but overall I don't know if I'd go again!"}
{"text":"The miscato was delicious, hanger steak was very small portion, sauce was mediocre, onions rings waaaaayyyy oversalted, mashed potatoes over salted, pasta dish very small portion  flavor was good all for a whopping 100000$! Atmosphere on a Saturday night dead. Maybe because the food sucks"}
{"text":"A tremendous thank you to Rooster's staff for their assistance tonight. My boyfriend's blood sugar was crashing -- he was weak, nauseous & faint with a splitting headache -- after the 48 Hour Film Festival at Booth Theater. I left my boyfriend sitting in a chair on the sky bridge and dashed in to Roosters. I explained the situation to the hostess and asked for ANY food they had ready to go. The hostess went and got a waiter (I believe his name was Chad, I was a bit frantic) who packaged up mashed potatoes, butter beans and beets with to go forks. I rushed back to where my boyfriend was waiting. He ate slowly and within a few minutes started to come back around. I drove us home and he's now resting. We appreciate Rooster's kindness. My parents have dined in before attending a show at Blumenthal and loved it, and despite his poor state, my boyfriend commented that his mashed potatoes, butter beans & beats were \"so good.\" We'll be back sometime under less dire circumstances!"}
{"text":"Had a date night with my wife planned to start at Roosters.  I made reservations that morning, but Akima (sp?) botched the reservations so we couldn't be seated. Ruined our night."}
{"text":"If you want au gratin potatoes, disregard this review. We've been to Roosters plenty of times and enjoyed every meal except this last, on 05/12/2017. Why so bad this time, not sure but service was horrible (yes, horrible)! Reservation at 7:45, sat down and order drinks, great they came fast. But this is where it went down hill and fast. Ordered two salads to accomplish our entrees/sides and waited over an hour for just one salad, the other never made it out. After almost 2 hours, our meals started to show up. Potatoes au gratin were great as the times we ordered before. The spiced chicken wings were not good but that's my take. Short rib felt rushed, fat still present even though slow cooked? Come on Roosters! The final straw were the onion rings, before were luscious thin fried battered onion rings and to my surprise the complete opposite; soggy thick onions that tasted like they were fired with calamari. Manager helped a little in our bad experience, but service this time generally killed the idea of ever going back. In the end, go if you want potatoes au gratin (the best so far in Charlotte) but stay away if you want great service on a Friday night! All in all, worse birthday dinner ever!"}
{"text":"Great feel to the place, intimate space but not overly tight. The staff was excellent, friendly, informative and affable. I opted for a craft cocktail, their smoked old fashion with rye whiskey . The food came fairly quickly (seated at the bar) - short ribs and the \"famous Mac and cheese\" did not disappoint. The burger looked tasty and several people nearby were making quick work of their burgers.  It's a place to go when looking for an informal lunch or dinner with a great vibe and food and excellence."}
{"text":"Winner winner chicken dinner!!  I came here with a group of friends before a show and it was great!  It was a week night and the first thing you need to know is the after work scene is poppin in the ground floor bar area.  It was packed!  But i was here for dinner and went upstairs to the more low key dining area which was nice.  The food was tasty!  I had a quarter chicken with BBQ sauce on the side.  That chicken was roasted to perfection and juicy!  The spinach was tasty, succotash, delish but the potatoes au gratin were dream worthy!  The up side to going with a large group is getting to sample a bit of everything and is was good!  I think we shared a bread pudding for dessert that was delicious and I'm typically not big on sweets.  The service was quick and kind which was a plus and I can't wait to go back....when some one else is paying because it ain't cheap!"}
{"text":"Rooster's Uptown is the first restaurant I tried in Uptown Charlotte after moving to the area. It is in the heart of Uptown within walking distance from all the major hotels, theaters and nightlife. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night around 5:30 and it was PACKED. Definitely a good sign...when we told the hostess we were there without a reservation she gave an apparent sign of distress, but with a little walkie-talkie magic (the place is huge) we were able to get in without a wait. The ambience was very lovely, warm and romantic, or would have been if it weren't for that night's crowd of mostly teenage girls and their mothers boasting about who camped out outside of the Four Seasons the longest waiting for a glimpse of Selena Gomez. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the charcuterie plate to start (obviously, we are Millennials after all) and were able to chose two cheeses and three meats. The waiter knew an incredible amount about the menu and was able to make recommendations for our selections. The plate also came with crusty bread, yummy house-made pickles, and a huge amount of ridiculously pungent mustard, the smell of which was nauseating (I hate mustard). I know it is a matter of preference, but in my opinion no charcuterie plate can be complete without a sweeter element...chutney, jam, honey, fruit...whatever tickles your fancy. By failing to have a sweet component I believe the charcuterie plate was lacking. Our waiter was very quick to bring me honey though when I mentioned this comment.

Rooster's Uptown's menu provided fresh, local ingredients, some prepared in creative ways I hadn't seen before and some offered in the same trendy way as all the menus of the \"upscale Southern\" restaurants now ubiquitous in Charlotte.  My boyfriend ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly, but the beans underneath were extremely oversalted (I'm guessing over-reduced). My polenta cakes with grated Parmesan were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside...just heavenly. The mac-and-cheese recommended by our server, with chevre (goat cheese) as the secret ingredient was sinfully good and even better reheated the next day! 

Rooster's Uptown was only given four stars because of the steep price and my boyfriend's overly cooked meat and improperly seasoned . The meal for the two of us, including gratuity, was $135 and we did not drink ANY alcohol. Even though the meal was AWESOME, I have had better meals for a fraction of that price.

I would recommend Rooster's Uptown for a girls' night or before catching a play. The wine list is extremely extensive and the a la carte menu is perfect for sharing. Rooster's will have something to please everyone."}
{"text":"What can I say...I was very impressed. Our waiter Eric was excellent. He made several suggestions. From his suggestions we ordered the duck breast (medium well) the chefs nailed it!!!! We also ordered the smoked chicken wings...delicious. They were cooked to perfection. We started off with a kale ceasar salad and a mixed greens salad with a champagne vinaigrette. Our side items for the main course included grits with bits of bacon and buttered wilted spinach. Simply amazing!!!! The ambiance was awesome and in great location to the venue we were attending. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and enjoyed it both times.  
Pros:
Nice service 
Food very good
We had the special of the day grouper and it was awesome and we love the chicken wings.  
Cons:
Portion of cheese charcuterie very small yet expensive. 
Sitting outside in the hallway.... no atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere for this uptown restaurant. It surprisingly has a lot of character and a great wine selection at all price points. I loved all the recommendations the waitress told us and they're daily specials. The cheese plates are smaller than expected but definitely delicious. Great place for a date night or bring out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Best wings EVER! Smoked and delicious, will definitely be back for more. 
You gotta stop by if you are uptown Charlotte. Hope Joe, the bartender, is there when you stop by, super cool guy!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Rooster's uptown last night and if the wait had not been so long, I would give 5 stars. We had reservations for 8 for weeks but when we arrived, our table was not ready. We waited 30 minutes to be seated and I waited another 20 before I was asked if I wanted a drink. There was also a long wait for appetizers and an even longer wait for dinner. The food however was to die for. I had the fried oysters that melted in my mouth for appetizer. For my entree I had the salmon with wilted spinach and onion rings. All three items were A+++. I didn't have dessert because I was so full but the menu looked great. The wait absolutely should not have been so long on a Tuesday night but I have to say the food was absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"ROOSTER'S has long been a favorite spot both at SouthPark and Uptown. 

Some favorites are the rotisserie chicken, the fresh veggie sides, and the fried oyster salad. Sadly the irons location doesn't serve the delicious French Onion soup that is a staple at the SouthPark location. 

Uptown has a great lunch dish I think is not served at SouthPark. It is Vietnamese Crispy Pork sandwich. Basically it is a Bahn Mi and let me just tell you that it is outstanding. The meat is cooked crispy to perfection. The bun is buttered and cooked nicely, all the ingredients are fresh and masterfully assembled with perfect proportions. I substituted the fried with a side salad and was so pleased I took more people back the next day to try it!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time last night after hearing so many co-workers rave about it. And boy we're they right!! The ambience is very cozy and has a charming, rustic feel. I love the concept of small plates so you can mix and match different items. I would highly recommend the beef short ribs, mac n cheese, and pan fried corn! Definitely a must try for those in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"One of the best dinner spots and after work hangouts in Uptown. For a nice dinner head upstairs. For drinks, appetizers and/or a casual dinner head downstairs to the bar area.

The food is the best thing here and probably closer to five stars. They offer some unique dishes and some real stand outs.

For lunch I go with the brisket burger or hickory fired NC pork bbq sandwich. Their fries are amazing. 

With cocktails or before dinner, get some smoked wings. They are very tasty. For dinner the beef short rib or hanger steak are best from the regular menu. The best special is the gnocchi with 4 meat bolognese. The best side dish for either lunch or dinner is the pan fried corn. You will want to eat more vegetables after eating this corn dish. 

And for dessert you MUST have the coconut cake. I grew up in Hawaii and often get turned off by anything coconut on the Mainland, but this is Hawaii worthy. 

The service is hit or miss at the bar. One bartender is great, but a couple others have way too much attitude. It's not the best bar in Charlotte and they're certainly not the best bartenders, but they think they are. Without those two I would likely rate Roosters 5 Stars. 

The food is worth going and if you want a pleasant experience stay upstairs. If you want to be ignored then don't listen to me and head downstairs to the bar."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal at Rooster's this evening. Great service and excellent recommendations. The cheese sampler was the superb!!!The salad and entrees were exceptional and the wine delicious."}
{"text":"So I had been in Charlotte for essentially a year for a project and working right near the epicenter. As part of my usual cadence of restaurants, rooster had ended up making its way into my dinner rotation. The spot has always been busy but relatively easy to grab a table. The joint has two floors with street level being a bar with a couple of high tables and the top floor being an open kitchen feel where folks are able to see the kitchen and a slew of tables. The décor is a bit rustic and there are rooster statues around to honor the name of the restaurant. The servers are always friendly and I was always greeted promptly at the door.
 
Over the many times I have been here, I have ordered a whole slew of items which included the wings, onion soup, charcuterie, hangar steak, short ribs, pork shoulder, mac and cheese, pan fried corn, spinach, and etc. The place is great to go with large groups or just small parties and as long as the person is a carnivore, this is definitely a place to check out. All the food I have had has been well cooked and tender. This joint is solid for the versatility and options across all the pasture and from the sea items and there always seems to be something that someone enjoys. I have enjoyed the hanger steak the best which was cooked to the right temperature and well-seasoned. The short rib was also tender but there are moments where it was a bit too fatty so some consistency if there was any critique on the dish. The charcuterie options are also good and I have enjoyed all the different cuts of protein available. One of the things that is really good on this menu is also the section I least go to for any menu. It is their coconut cake off of their dessert menu. I really don't eat desserts often but this one is pretty amazing. The cake is extremely moist (ugh hate using that word but best way to describe) and it comes poured with a vanilla bean sauce over it. A fellow yelp elite ordered it and I promised to just take a bite the first time but I think I ended up eating half of it. Whoops!

All in all, a solid place for dinner with the options and make sure to save room for that cake!"}
{"text":"Another solid meal during my stay in Charlotte.

My brother and I had a ton of the menu : gnocchi duck sugo, duck confit, bresaola, mushrooms campo de montalban pizza, anson mills polenta, and Barbee Farms butter wilted spinach.

My favorite thing was the duck confit, and everything else was fantastic although the pizza could've used the slightest hint of something spicy to take it good to great. Definitely a place to hit up next time I'm in town to visit him."}
{"text":"My family and I loved this our first time experience at the Rooster. The food was well-seasoned and just simply delicious. The customer service was amazing and the food come out to the table in a timely manner.  for the bread pudding. You must try the salmon and asparagus!"}
{"text":"Great date night place! The house smoked salmon is amazing, we paired it with the Humbolt Fog at our waitress' suggestion and it was just wonderful. Someone at your table must order the pork shoulder, it should not be missed! Very attentive waitstaff, good lighting, not too loud even on a Friday night. Food arrives at your table just minutes after ordering  their kitchen must be very well organized! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my cousins birthday, we were seated \"outside\" in the corporate building. I loved the classy vibes of the place, very nice! Our waiter introduced himself formally, he knew the dishes very well & answered all of our questions. We were given bread & it wasn't warmed up; it kinda tasted like sliced bread from the package tbh. We ordered some dishes to share my FAVORITE dish was the calamari, the meat tasted very fresh & it was just seasoned perfectly! I had the mushroom dish & it was okay. However the other dishes I didn't really enjoy as much because I just felt like everything was way to oversalted and way overpriced for what we got. The salmon for example, it was fresh but we literally got a small piece of salmon that tasted like it's worth only half the price. There was nothing really special about it, same goes for the other dishes. Overall I did enjoy the service and the vibes of the place but I don't think I would be quick to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So...posted hours are until 11pm on Saturday but I got there at 10:30pm this evening and they told us they were closed and locked the doors behind us after showing us out. Very annoying when we planned on eating at a place that was supposed to be open but they just decided to close early. So they should update their hours or stay open until they say they are open."}
{"text":"Roosters - a non pretentious welcoming eatery. Everyone has a smile says hello and ensures your comfort and satisfaction. With the ONE exception ! An exception so unordinary it sticks out. If you come a cross an alleged manager (initials LW) be advised that she is not a reflection of the staff at Roosters - it's much easier to nit pick than to have a genuinely kind personality - LW should learn to acknowledge people, be sensitive and smile. It goes a long way LW."}
{"text":"Ok, as with most restaurants in the uptown area parking can be a pain in the ass! Fortunately we were heading to the game later that night so we parked in the parking deck near the BBT Stadium. 

We were greeted immediately and made our way upstairs to the dining area. The first floor is their bar area which is also available for dining, but upstairs is more intimate and roomy. 

It's very nice and dark which I like, they have mostly booths and a beautiful open kitchen. Our server was good, making some recommendations that we would later take. I have to ding them on forgetting to bring us fresh bread to the table. 

Their menu is A La Carte which I was unaware of. I'm not a fan of this method of dining, it seems shady. Anyhow, we ordered the recommended Beef Short Rib and the Salmon. We wanted puréed potatoes, but unfortunately they weren't ready at the time so we chose Mac & Cheese instead. 

The food was delicious and well presented, however the portions were pathetic! For what they're charging they need to give the customer a bigger portion. We were both literally rationing our food in order to make it somewhat last. Small portions are a sign of a stingy owner and a stingy chef. 

The meal was very expensive and we ended up eating again at the ballpark. I would not recommend this restaurant if you're hungry. You will leave hungry and unfulfilled."}
{"text":"Pan seared Scallops,  rotisserie chicken, beets and peas were excellent.  The molten chocolate cake was a good desert but I think frosting and ice creme would be an improvement on this desert item."}
{"text":"Rooster's food is average. I've been a couple of times and both experiences were unremarkable. I don't generally bother writing restaurant reviews, but upon recently learning that Jim Noble--the owner of Rooster's--actively supports the far-right, discriminatory group Alliance Defending Freedom, I felt I couldn't remain silent. Guess what? You have the freedom to spend your money at any variety of restaurants in Charlotte that have better food and are owned by decent humans who operate their businesses ethically. If you care about not supporting a bigot, then there are plenty of other wonderful restaurants to patronize. I'll never set foot in another Jim Noble establishment* again.  

* King's Kitchen, Rooster's, and the soon to open Noble Smoke"}
{"text":"Underrated lunch spot and even better date spot! This restaurant features two levels: downstairs bar room is casual with communal seating, upstairs more traditional seating with booths (I recommend sitting by the open kitchen for a more interactive dining experience). The menu is tapas/small plates style and great for sharing.

If you like dry rubbed, non-fried wings, Rooster's has the best in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Affordable. Cozy.  Great great menu without an ounce of pretentiousness. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good lunch, great vibe and good service!"}
{"text":"Roosters is a phenomenal restaurant nestled in uptown. Went last night right before the bobcats game.  Unfortunately didn't have reservations so our only option was to sit upstairs at the chefs table. This was the best experience and will sit there everytime we go again. Its like being in the middle of hells kitchen only without all the competition and language.  It was an experience to see each address each other as chef, work together and bring amazing food. 3 seats down I believe we had the honor of the head chef/owner (sitting there enjoying food)who checked in with us to make sure everything was up to par.  We started with the cheese and salami pizza which was perfect size to share and tasted wonderful.  We then moved to mac n cheese, chili cauliflower, duck breast and as an added bonus the chef gave us a sampling of their creamy yukon. All were to cooked to perfection and easily one of the best meals I've had in Charlotte. Mac n cheese was creamy, perfect spice on the cauliflower and the duck was cooked to perfection.  We finished the meal with some bread pudding which was also very tasty.  will definitely be heading back soon"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the pleasure of dining at Rooster's Uptown, and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. My first surprise was how much space there actually is inside. I've passed the street level entrance numerous times on foot, but never went in. At first glance
, it looks very small, but once you walk in, you realize the restaurant continues upstairs. Both levels have a rustic design with intimate lighting. A very nice pick for a romantic date, or date that involves more things uptown. The menu is a la carte style, with lots of appetizers to choose from and sides that are large enough to share. This visit, I had the quarter chicken and Mac and cheese. The Mac was amazing; it was served in a mini cast iron dish , so it stayed hot the entire meal. The blend of cheeses was out of this world, and the crust on top was SO GOOD. We also sampled a great selection of red wines. The service we received was also excellent : Grant was very patient with our table, made great selections, and was very prompt and polite. I highly recommend this location for a after work dinner, date, family dinner, girls night...pretty much any occasion."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, complete with a wall of rooster decor.  Five of us went to Roosters tonight for dinner.  We had salads, short ribs, salmon, and shrimp.  For our sides to share, we had beets, corn, spinach, and mac n cheese.  Meals and sides were delicious.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Rooster's Uptown based solely on hotel recommendation.  Started with a cheese plate... good stuff. Got the broccoli (daily special), Mac and cheese and BBQ chicken (sauce in the side). The chicken fell off the bone and it was soooo good. The broccoli was good and the MAC was UNDERWHELMING (this came highly recommended by the staff too). Got the bread pudding for dessert....the BEST way to end the meal. Got one of the cocktails too... pretty good. The food however is pricey...2of us shared an app, entree, 2sides, dessert 1cocktail and 1 soda.... $95 including tip...it was good but i was expecting a lot more for the price."}
{"text":"I've ate lunch here many times.  The food,  prices and service are fantastic every time. Very consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"I got the chicken it was god awful felt like me and my friends were at the kings kitchen! Than we found out its owned by the same guy jim nobles! I would like to know what places this guy owns so I do not go to them! God bless you jim but you food sucks!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great selection on menu. And flavor was decent, nothing special. So if you're looking for a nice American style restaurant, it serves its purpose."}
{"text":"Not worth the price in my opinion. The food was mediocre, portions were sparse, service was practically nonexistent on a slow day (i.e. no excuse for being ignored).

I work in Uptown and love smell coming from Rooster's. I decided to try it out and I was not at all impressed. I might be prompted to try it again... Hopefully I'll be inclined to change this review on a better day."}
{"text":"I LOVE Roosters!!!  Haha - it is so perfect for me.  Located in 1BAC (also attached to Founders Hall) it is very easy to get to.  The bar is downstairs where they have bar bites (I heard they are great but have not tried them.)  Upstairs is the main restaurant with a huge open kitchen - love that!!  It makes a very exciting atmosphere.  The booths are cozy and welcoming.    

Great variety on the menu and huge wine list.  The fried oysters are the best I have ever had - light breading and smooth flavor.  I have had sandwiches here as well as the BBQ quarter chicken.  The BBQ sauce is homemade and very unique.  It is a thin sauce but exceptionally flavorful.  The portions are small but I think they are perfect for me - I hate taking leftovers home (especially if I am headed to a play at the Booth next.)  Great spot!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this restaurant as it was close to the theater.
We planned dinner with 2 other couples.
A nice comfortable atmosphere,  and good attentive service.
A few of my dining mates found the menu a bit confusing, as 4 beige papers were secured to a clipboard, 2 for the menu, 2 for wines and beverages. I think the menu was not organized  as most are with appetizers, salads, poultry, meat, pasta  categories etc.. Actually I found the menu intriquing with listings for: from the larder, the woods,  from the garden etc. Plenty of  menu choices for  pizzas, charcuterie, cheeses, sandwiches, pasta, steak and seafood , yummy desserts, but   can be pricey depending what was ordered as entrees  are ala cart. We ordered among us : Fried oysters, iceberg salad, tomato bisque, 1/2 roast chicken entree, fish entree, steak entrees, side of mashed potatoes, mushroom medley. Food plated nicely, came out hot. Portion sizes varied.$40 steaks, nice size, cooked to order, fish entree small piece, pricey for the size. Bread and butter on the table.
All dishes were very tasty."}
{"text":"Jim Noble, the owner of roosters is a known anti LGBT leader. He has fought for discrimination in this state. And has used God to back up his hate and bigotry. I love God and a praise him, and I Ask God to expose these false representation of God. And I refuse and hope others will as well, to give any money to any establishment that Jim Noble has anything to do with."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything was perfect. We had a bread salad, hanger steak and pan fried corn to share between the two of us. Then we caved and shared a brownie with gelato for dessert. We were stuffed. And oh so happy. The food was glorious. The service friendly and attentive without being overbearing. I would love to come back and try more from the menu which seems full interesting options. Seriously, this is a great restaurant ."}
{"text":"Good food, a bit expensive for what you get. They seemed to be \"out\" of several things on the menu and didn't tell us until we requested them. Small portions, I had duck confit with green bean and beets, pasta looked good, nice wine by the glass list. I wish we would have stayed in the bar area."}
{"text":"Where can you get duck tenders?  They were one of the specials tonight at this unique wood fired grill/gastro pub!  They were actually tender with a decent but not overpowering  breading, and the chili aioli dipping sauce had a sneaky heat that was just right.

Usually I'm a carnivore for my main course,  but this time I went for the mushroom pizza, a thick layer of asagio cheese served over an even thicker layer of finely chopped showrooms laced with garlic, shallots & truffle oil.  Yum.  Plain & simple."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night as roosters was within walking distance of our hotel and it did not disappoint. The bbq chicken was great and my date enjoyed her pork. We arrived with reservations and were seated immediately. The service was great and I had some of the best fried oysters I've ever eaten here. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at Rooster's - tried some different dishes.  Ordered the hanger steak medium rare, Mac and cheese and pan fried corn (these 3 items were high on the recommendation list from other Yelpers)

Hangers steak definitely lived up to the hype - cooked exactly as ordered, can definitely taste the smokey fire flavor and whatever that sauce is they put on top was delicious.

Pam fried corn also good - very well balance flavor of sweet and savory, could go a little lighter with the salt based on my own preference (but that's my palate I think)

Mac and Cheese was solid but I have had better elsewhere.  Cheese sauce had nice texture, however I would have liked to see a more toasted top and again, similar to the first experience I had here. The square plate presentation is pretty but not the friendliest to eat from and the pasta cooled too quickly in my opinion.

I also tried the Wittekerke (in place of blue moon which they do not have).  Good recommendation from the bartender.

Something that I thought could use a little improvement - the bar is decent size and at one time there were at least 2 bartenders there plus a 3rd helper.  But there are also times where the bar was completely unmanned (as in bar full
of people sitting there, no one behind the counter).

Both time I sat and ate at the bar - not that easy to grab the attention from staff.  So if expecting a normal meal service I would suggest sitting at a table."}
{"text":"Again We were sitting at the bar downstairs and the guy bartender is still awful.  Noooooo customer service what so ever, we thought that he might be fired by now but hes still there. He must be either friends of the owner or the manager cause people around us were even commenting on how bad he is. You guys need to do something about him."}
{"text":"I don't remember why we decided to stop here for dinner, but I'm glad we did. Not wanting to blow our budget on an expensive meal, we had to choose a bit carefully, but luckily there were options that interested us.

We started with the house cured duck plate.  Super thin slices of tender, cured duck meat piled up on the plate with a drizzle of olive oil. It's delicate, subtly smoky, and wonderful.  I could have eaten two pounds of it. No, really. Chalk it up to poor impulse control.

For the meal, we decided to order one of their pizzas and a batch of chicken wings, and split everything. The wings were really excellent - smoked/grilled, spicy and absolutely packed with flavor. The pizza (it was an olive oil based mushroom pizza) was a bit less fulfilling. It wasn't particularly bad, but it was a bit light on substance, and the olive oil base was overdone, leaving the pizza feeling too oily as a whole.

The upstairs dining area is dimly lit and attractive, and it feels private in the booth, despite the room's size. Our waitress was great, offering her suggestions and maintaining just the right amount of presence."}
{"text":"When you first sit down and try to order but they tell you your first, second, and third choice are not available. Then once your food arrives (mushroom fregola) and it's not great. You only eat half then your waiter, Adrian, who had been to your table just to tell you what they were out off, scoops up your plate without even asking if you enjoyed it. 

Rushed service. Subpar food. Maybe my other 3 choices would have been better, but I'll never know as we don't plan to return. 

They also scooped up our unused silverware before our food even arrived. Uncoordinated to say the least."}
{"text":"Nice little place to chill after work. The wine selection was great. The food, out of this world, however, they must be saving for the Apocalypse. I ordered the baby back ribs but maybe failed to see that there was no 's' at the end of \"ribs\" and they served just ONE rib. But let me tell you, top 2 or 3 rib I've ever ate in my life. They also have this roasted corn that was great too. Service was good, but overall severely over priced. $90 for two. We each ordered the rib, I had a glass of wine and my buddy just had water and no side to go with the rib. And yes 20% tip included in the $90."}
{"text":"Brisket burger was best burger I have ever had.  Hands down, amazing!!!

Beers on tap are great local brews, especially good IPA's as I like."}
{"text":"I get scallops at almost every nice restaurant we go to, but Roosters has the best scallops hands down. The restaurant can be tricky to find, but the food and atmosphere can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Roosters because it was suggested to me by several people while I was in town on business. Sadly, it did not live up to the hype. 

I arrived around 545pm on a weekday evening and it was not very busy at all. I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was solo. Immediately I noticed that the bartender was very grouchy and abrasive. After handing me a drink menu he proceeded to retreat to the corner, even after seeing I was ready to order he did not come over for 10 mins. He made and delivered my drink which was very good but he did not offer me a food menu. 20 mins later he finally gave me one. I decided on the mussels which were a daily special. I let him know I was gluten free and to not include the bread. Of course when my meal arrived the bread was in my bowl. I really didn't want to have to send it back but I also wasn't in the mood to be sick all night when I'm traveling. So that was rather frustrating. 

While my mussels where very good I was overall disappointed in the service. The bartender was just simply not a happy man and needed to work on his customer service skills."}
{"text":"Will definitely come back! The hubby and I ate here before a concert, and it was wonderful! We had a reservation and were seated right away. Servers were excellent and so was the food! It was a bit noisy though, which would be my only complaint, but no biggie. :) We had the flank steak (cooked to perfection - medium rare), the au gratin potatoes (which were AWESOME!!!!!), spinach, and shared a bottle of moscato. It was the perfect pre-concert meal and the perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of colleagues for lunch. We had reservation so our table was ready when we arrived. Our waiter took everyone's beverage order and came back in fair amount. We were having a good time chatting about our background and getting to know each other outside of our office. 

Waiter came back to get our lunch order and I asked couple of questions about Kale salad, he wasn't sure so I said I would like to order that salad if they can add black beans on top. He took everyone else's order and we were back to our discussion. 

My order came in and he brought kale salad without the black beans, he left the salad on my spot and said we don't add black beans sorry!  Now, I didn't want to be a D**K but I thought I made it clear that I want to order Kale salad if they can add black beans as my protein portion which means my order was a conditional on \"if they add black beans\". 

Even though this was corporate sponsored lunch, they gave us a table outside which means every single ladies went in and outside of that restaurant were checking us out. I don't want any lady checking me out while I am opening my mouth to take bite, that's gross. 

I think the host and the wait staff could use a little training."}
{"text":"Rooster's food is really good - the wings are awesome. That being said, we were looking forward to planning a small (8 people) surprise birthday celebration for our friend but the experience was less than celebratory. Most restaurants at least make sure to pay extra attention to the birthday girl/boy but in our case, she was the last to even receive her drink. Many of the girls' waters were never refilled. Considering it was a special occasion, there was no special attention or effort made by the restaurant to help celebrate the birthday girl. Usually a restaurant does a dessert or something, but nothing here. Probably wouldn't tell people to go if they're celebrating. Maybe order and pick up - service is better at home."}
{"text":"Early Friday night dinner, no waiting, attentive staff. Food was very good. Hendrix as background music, especially at 6:30, was incongruous. To their credit, the manager lightened it up a bit.

IU'd go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is upstairs and the bar is downstairs. Fantastic place to have a nice dinner with your loved ones and friends. This is not a casual dine in place. The host is very nice and I was seated right away. The place was busy but not packed for a Saturday memorial weekend night. My server Ricky was excellent, he's friendly and attentive. He recommended some wine for my sweet taste and the choices were good. I ordered catch of the day served with wild rice. The dish was prepared nicely the portion was small which is normal for an upscale restaurant. If you don't like spicy food I suggest stay away from ordering this. The fish was cooked nicely but too salty for my taste. They might  added too much seasoning in my food. I like my food seasoned well but not overwhelming. And I love spicy food. So this dish didn't impress me. Unfortunately I didn't order anything else to rate so as for now I can only put a 3 star because the food was so so for the price tag."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our first time last night and I have to say the food was very good.  We had two issues that, in my opinion were not handled well.  First, the restaurant was not very crowded and our waitress seemed over her head.  On two occasions the manager had to step in and on one another waitress stepped in.  Then we ordered the coconut cake which was totally dried out.  The manager came by to apologize for the new chef's mistake.  Now I do not expect to get anything free but after the excessive bad service and bad desert, comping the second \"replacement desert\" would have been a gracious gesture.  I am sure we will go back but if we have a repeat experience it will be the last time."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The food is excellent, don't skip the sides for sharing!  The mac & cheese is great.  I have been here twice for large business dinners (20+ people) and the service was good except for refilling our wine which we were fine to do ourselves."}
{"text":"I must be honest, I was sooo excited about coming to this place only because of all the amazing reviews on here {Yelpers}. When I walked in the place was beautiful!!! The host was very pleasant and welcoming and stated I could have a drink at the bar while my table finished up. My experience with the bartenders was not impressive at all and I was not pleased with their services.

After enjoying my wine with my friend who met me there we tabbed out and went to our table. Upstairs was gorgeous I was thinking to myself we should have just come up here! We were seated a a round booth and I shared with the girls what took place downstairs. As I stepped away to use the restroom, I noticed a gentleman and to my surprise he was an old coworker {it's been 10+ years} who's now the manager of this Roosters!{Hey Bo!} I did inform him of what took place and he sincerely apologized and mentioned that I would be addressed immediately. Which it was and from there on our night went from sour to remarkable and I'm so glad it did. I did not want my first experience at Roosters to be this way and Bo truly turned things around. And sweet Sarah such an amazing and friendly server. We ate like little hungry women and laughed endlessly. 

Thank You Roosters for turning around our evening and showing outstanding gratitude for your customers."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a great menu and everything looked really good. However, I have never experienced more salt in my food ever. It's a shame because everything looked and sounded good but I just can't get past the over loading of salt. This review based only on the food , everything else ( beer selection, service) 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm one of those that uses Yelp for recommendations but doesn't leave many reviews, but friends, if you are in Uptown Charlotte and don't stop here, you are missing out!  Chef's counter is the best seat in the house. Service could not have been better. Wood fired shrimp was perfect with a butter sauce that rivals anything I've ever eaten. Don't walk out without having the pan grilled corn, you'll regret it. Old fashioned with local rye bourbon to top it all off. I only wish I was in town longer ... maybe lunch tomorrow. .."}
{"text":"WOW. We did not have reservations and although it was a Monday night, the place was packed with no reserved table available. We sat upstairs at the open seating overlooking the kitchen and could not have been more perfectly situated. We had a superb view of the works of art coming out of the kitchen and of all the entire second floor dining area. It was perfect for us, as I was there with one of my best girlfriends, catching up while she visited NC for a conference. We ordered the Cheese, meats and olive tray that the waiter offered to put together for us, and he did flawlessly. It contained fabulous pickled cauliflower and out of this world mustard and bread to pair with the items- it was wonderful! For dinner, I had the Hanger Steak and she had the scallops; we paired with sides of spinach and OUT OF THIS WORLD MAC and CHEESE! I'm not exaggerating- this mac and cheese was literally the best I've ever had in my life. To die for! The wait staff, hostess, runners, bussers and kitchen staff were all friendly and engaging- we enjoyed how busy the hum of the restaurant was but it never affected our service and we will return when in Charlotte downtown. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Good farm to table restaurant, we had the BBQ chicken and it was quite tasty. Darren was our server and was great, we will be bsck."}
{"text":"Awesome open kitchen with wood-fired grill.  For lunch, I really love the scallop salad with buttermilk lime dressing, anything involving their mac and cheese, and the Vietnamese pork sandwich (sort of like a Banh mi)."}
{"text":"I ate here while in town for work. The atmosphere was chill and was a great place for me to sit and have a glass of wine alone at the bar. Good wine selection, and the wings I had were fantastic. If I was in the area again I'd go again."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great staff, FOOD IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT!!

I was super excited to eat here, but after the first impressions, the food itself was just good, not great like many reviews say. My three word review would be \"TRYING TO HARD\" the Short Rib looked marvelous, but compared to what we had in Ireland (anyplace in Ireland) it wasn't close, but it did look marvelous. The Mac n Cheese was good, but again just not great. 

The best thing at the table imo was my daughter's brisket burger that did taste really good. Everything else it just seemed like the chef said \"How can I make mine really different?\" and then applied that to every dish. 

Looking forward to trying more restaurants during our week stay though!!"}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate our 11th anniversary here, and we were not disappointed! The setting was romantic without being too stuffy, the service top notch, and the food outstanding. I had the sea scallops with a side of potatoes au gratin, and my wife had the tuna. Both dishes were terrific, and the server's wine pairing top notch. Will definitely be back, although probably at the more-convenient South Park location."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars. We got the short rib. It was savory, but came to the table kind of cold and it was a bit fattier than I liked.  Kale salad is great. Mac and cheese you can pass. 

Ambiance: very nice! 4.5 stars

Service : 3.5 stars.

Overall, I would give it a 3."}
{"text":"The setting is pleasing and the bar easily accommodated a group for drinks and dinner. Never made it to the resturant but enjoyed a variety of dishes. While I did not have the wings and salmon - everyone who did was very happy.  I had a bunch of sides -- beets with an unexpected bite; generous helping of fries; upscale corn; perfectly cooked asparagus. The wilted spinach was good but truly wilted - a little soupy.  Centrally located and close to everything.  Would be good for a light meal before the game or a casual dinner with a small or large group of friends. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food stands on it's own. The flavors are complex and bold. I would want a little more light in the restaurant. The bar downstairs is a lot of fun and has a good vibe. I love the food. The chicken has a great flavor. The potatoes wow.  I take all my guests to Charlotte there. Thank you for being here."}
{"text":"This hip new American eatery is 80% of the right pieces. Right look? Sure. The design of the menu and the food should all rock. BUT...  Start with the pervasive attitude that starts at the front door that is, at best brusque. We didn't have a reservation, and I have no problem eating at the bar, but I have a BIG problem with the hostesses just being so put out about you having the nerve to show up on them and tilt their day.  Better training sets a better tone. Of course it was no better downstairs at the bar. Busy place, but when you sit for five minutes and wait for one of the three bar staff to get around to helping you, and finally have to reach out to them to get them to slow down and deal with you, not a warm and fuzzy feeling. The menu was dynamite, BUT... When the food came out?  My pork chop had been brined so long that half of the salt in the Dead Sea was in it. My grits were tasty but dry and lumpy. The haricots verts were drowned in butter. It was just sloppy cuisine, either executed by a staff not under its chef, or a chef that doesn't really care what the consistency of his dishes is supposed to look like. Once you get the bar staff to slow down, they were really cool people. So TONE is the big thing up front that needs changing, and some love for the food in the back, and this could easily be as good as the Yelpers here seem to think it is."}
{"text":"It was good.  I loved my salad but my short rib was a bit dry. The sides were delicious."}
{"text":"Rooster's was very very good! We had just come in from the airport and were eating lunch/dinner at a weird time. Delicious fancy-pants Southern. My flat iron steak was cooked perfectly. We ordered a bunch of small plates and my whole table was happy. Also, I really appreciated our server bringing me mashed whipped potatoes even though they don't serve them until after 5:00PM."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Had a dinner meeting at this place. The service and food was excellent. They have a great selection of craft beers. For appetizers I would recommend the smoked wings. They were great. Around the table the hanger steak and duck were highly recommended. The sides were great. Highly recommend the Mac and cheese or the potatoes. The vegetables were also great. We ended with fantastic gelato and some had the coconut cake. This is a must go. One of the best places and great value for the price."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Rooster's. It was a recommendation from a friend and boy they were right! Ryan was our server and was very knowledgeable attuned to our dining experience. The cheese selection was amazing and fresh. I chose the short rib which was braised and extremely tender with a flavorful jus. The pan fried corn is a must for a side as it is grilled on the cob then tossed in a pan with some butter and seasoning. My girlfriend got the gnocchi which was pleasantly soft with a delectable tomato sauce. We chose the the hand pie that was filled with seasonal fall fruit and resembles a pop over that is topped with a fresh fruit puree. The flavors were good, but it was a little bready and left some to desire. Overall if you are thinking of going here, do not second guess and make the reservation as you are sure to enjoy."}
{"text":"Roosters is a very good restaurant.  Their menu has a variety of goodies on it. We opted to have finger foods prior to the Bruno Mars concert. The smokey wings I had were absolutely delicious! The calamari was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Not chewy at all and seasoned so well. The staff was very upbeat and friendly and accommodating. There's an upstairs and downstairs section. We made reservations, and good thing we did. The place was absolutely crowded, wall to wall. But we were soon seated only about 5 minutes after we arrived. I'd absolutely go back to Rooster's."}
{"text":"I like the food here, almost everything is almost always good.  This last visit, though, the service was very slow.  When we made reservations, we were told we had to make them for 5:15 as 5:30 was already full.  However, at 5:30, we still hadn't had our orders taken and the restaurant around us was still empty.  At least two in the party were already on their second beers, we had to repeatedly ask for more bread as they didn't even bring out enough bread for the number of people at the table--and after 30 minutes we asked for a bread refill because they still hadn't taken our food orders.  

It was amusing to watch the server explain the menu set-up to each person as she was taking their order--but it didn't seem to occur to her to explain to the table at large how the menu was organized.  She also struggled with the checks later, and, although we did have a party of 8, I didn't see any automatic gratuity added.

I ordered the mushroom medley which was absolutely delicious--and of course it was, it was swimming in herbed butter!--the parsnip (singular) which was supposed to be roasted but was noticeably blackened and crunchy (and a much smaller serving that I'd have expected for $10), and the mac and cheese side.  The server cautioned me about ordering another dish as I was attempting to, that these three were plenty.  The mac and cheese wasn't that big (size of a typical starchy side) and the single parsnip was disappointing, but the mushrooms came in a LARGE soup bowl and were cut into nice large pieces as well.  There weren't any leftovers, but she was right that I definitely did not need another dish.  

In the area, I think this is my favorite sit-down place."}
{"text":"Food was fine but not great. Could have got the same quality food at any good BBQ joint for about half the cost. They only have four beers on tap, everything else was bottles. Dinner for two, a drink each, and an app cost us a hundred bucks. The atmosphere was good but didn't compensate for the establishments other short comings. We also waited 45 minutes for the check after our table was cleared of plates. A better alternative would be some place like Tupelo Honey on South Blvd."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't find a complaint. Our reservation was about ~10 min. delay but the hostess personally brought us drinks to wait. Our waiter was excellent and welcoming. 
Started with the pimento cheese and was recommended the duck which paired perfectly for an appetizer. 
For entrees, we had Cod with mixed greens/vegetables and an open faced short rib sandwich/toast. Split was the potatoes au gratin in the middle. All of it, absolutely delicious. Rich potatoes, tender meat and very flavorful fish. I recommend making a reservation to guarantee a seat, especially on weekends. Will definitely be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Service - 5 stars. The servers are knowledgeable, polite and professional.

Ambiance - 4 stars. Mostly bar stool seating on the first floor. Stools have a neat curved design, but aren't incredibly comfy. Decent music, good mood lighting.

Food - 4 stars. Had the pork shoulder - very good. Not the best I've ever had, could have been more tender. Vinegar sauce was bomb dot com. Coleslaw light and refreshing. Peas were buttery as could be, which won them points in my book.

Drinks - 3 stars. The selection of various hard liquors was okay at best. Considering the meager selection, I don't really feel like my Basil Hayden neat should have set me back by $12. Beers were much more reasonable and numerous, including many local craft brews. Would have been nice to know the ABV percentages.

To summarize, great place for a date. Nice ambiance will put you in the mood for romance. Just pray to the liquor gods that your date is not a whiskey/gin/vodka connoisseur, as they'll probably be disappointed. 

As for me, I'll probably be back because it's right across the street from work and I usually get done at around 10 pm."}
{"text":"While in Charlotte visiting family, I wanted to have a quality Southern meal before hitting up the Gantt Center for some culture. Rooster for the bill perfectly. The decor is trendy, and the menu is enticing. My date and I both ordered the shrimp and grits, which is spicy but manageable and just the right portion size. We split a side of succotash, which was sweet and buttery and would have been too much for one person. No drinks or time for dessert, but maybe when we come back. A little pricey for every-day lunch but definitely good for a date or to impress a client or guest."}
{"text":"Went here with a few co-workers after a conference on the first night of Restaurant Week. We came in with six diners without a reservation around 6:00 and were told we could be seated but we'd have to be out of our booth by 8:00. I've never had a restaurant tell me that my booth was pre-reserved before but considering we were in a big leather booth near the window I guess it made sense. Unfortunately, when we were told that the RW menu had to be eaten by the whole table instead of just by the people who wanted it our numbers dropped to four as two people left to find more casual dining elsewhere. Rooster was worth sticking around for- I got to the RW in Providence and Boston every year and their menu knocked almost everything else I've eaten up north out of the water. I got the heirloom tomato salad, steak, and creme brulee and it was totally worth paying full price, never mind $30 total. Convenient location, incredible food and good service (except for our waitress forgetting to explain the RW stipulations before we ordered drinks which confused things a bit when folks tried to leave). Would definitely eat at Rooster again the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Rooster's had a nice dining area. Great staff that all really pitched in. The food was good but only the mac and cheese was special taste wise. Duck wings was my first time but I liked the little bit of spice. Old fashion drink was nice and strong. Cost was pretty fair as well for uptown. Great date night spot."}
{"text":"Dined her for lunch and so glad we did!

The atmosphere was casual but very cozy and welcoming. I ordered the Vietnamese pork sandwich with a side salad and my boyfriend ordered the bbq meatloaf with mashed sweet potatoes and tobacco onions. Both our meals were extremely delicious and well cooked. The entire place is farm fresh to table and its evident with their  menu! Both of us cleaned our plates!!

I loved being able to see the kitchen as its setup as a show kitchen. We certainly want to come back to try dinner!!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on Friday, July 3, 2015. Great experience. Very friendly and welcoming. Bartenders were very attentive and courteous. My Long Island Ice Tea was freshly made. I think this place uses their own ingredients to make their drinks. Definitely higher quality drinks than chain restaurants. I will come back the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Excellent presentation, food and service 
(looked like a good bar too, but alas I'm working)

I had the BBQ meat loaf and the Mac and cheese, both above par.

I'll be back next time I am in town.


Hint - the bar downstairs (where you enter) is not the only dining area, theres a slightly more classy main dining room on the second floor as well. 
(my review is from the bar however)"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about. This simple food was elegant and well thought out. If you enter from the first floor don't be fooled that the place is dead because the action is upstairs. 

The wings have a dry rub that is spicy and keeps you going back for more; the short rib is delicious; the sweet corn on the side is amazing. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"The beef short rib, mac & cheese, & potatoes at gratin are absolutely delicious! My husband enjoyed his hanger steak as well! Great food & wonderful service... I can't wait to go back for dinner again!

Update: Enjoyed another dinner here last night & we tried various side items (butter beans, puréed potatoes, & of course the mac & cheese) which were all delicious! The smoked wings are a must! We've been fortunate to have Grant serve us both visits & could not have been more pleased with his exceptional service!"}
{"text":"This visit blew me away. We started with the calamari appetizer. I opted for the Sea Bass with lentil while my group ordered the fingerling potatoes, Mac and cheese and collard greens. This was followed by the best bread pudding known to man and the out of this world chocolate mousse. I opted for the Joseph Carr Chardonnay. The entire experience...was divine. The service was excellent- perfect balance of attentiveness without the feeling of intrusion. I will not miss this spot during my visit to Charlotte and you shouldn't either!"}
{"text":"Really great experience. Had very good service. Bbq chicken was phenomenal. I tired several sides, and all were fantastic. I would say my top two were the onion rings and the grits. Save room for desert.  The coconut cake is fantastic."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte alone for work and saw Roosters reviewed on Yelp.
Had the Arugula Salad with fruit and Goat cheese to start - it was just OK. A little shy on the peaches. Had the Short Rib and Gratin Potatoes for dinner and it was out of this world.

I'd recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"This place comes highly recommended from myself and my family. Their mushroom medley is the only time I've ever had that as a side and it was so delicious, you won't be disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs and he claims it's the best he's ever had. He even requested for the recipe which they did provide him with. It was an all around cool experience and we had a wonderful time. You should check it out!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing and the service was incredible. From the hostess to the waiter to the manager everyone was incredible!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for NYers traveling on business and want to check out a local spot.  Great food, great vibe, and the bartender Painter makes you feel like an old friend.  Southern Menu with a foodie feel and local brews on tap. Don't miss the corn!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is insanely delicious. It's so easy to drop some serious cash at this place, but it's one of the few places in Charlotte that I feel is absolutely worth it! 

Fried oysters are a MUST. My date and I both craved them so much we returned a week later to eat them again. 

I also loved the seafood pasta with their homemade noodles. Date had the duck gnocchi and probably would have licked his plate if he could... 

The wait staff is friendly, fun, and makes the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was A++. Our server was fantastic (I forgot to get her name) and everything we tasted was better than the last. We started the meal with a few glasses of wine and a plate of fried calamari. I could have calamari once a day for the rest of my life and die happily so i am somewhat of a calamari snob. This calamari was some of the absolute best i have ever had. My only complaint about it is the tentacles are always my favorite part and our plate didn't have any. The calamari comes with Parmesan cheese on top and two sauces, marinara and a sauce similar to yum yum sauce you get at hibachi restaurants.  It also had two fried lemon slices as well. I never would have thought to deep fry lemon slices, but it was a perfect pairing for the calamari. We decided to get three entrees and three sides and to split them all since everything at Rooster's is a-la-carte. Will ordering our waitress suggested that we get the pizza first, did i mention how awesome she was, and helped us pick our other entrees and sides. So we got the Mushrooms and Campo de Montalban Pizza first. It was perfectly burnt and completely fantastic. It only had olive oil  as a sauce and this was perfect complement to the mushrooms. 
For our main entrees we got the Seared Sea Scallops and the Beef Short Ribs. I normally am hesitant about short ribs because i've had some bad experiences with it but my dad was insistent and our waitress told us that it was roasted for 4 days. I gave in and i'm very happy i did. The Beef Short Rib was so tender it fell apart on your fork. The Scallops were also seared beautifully. They had the perfect golden color and were so deliciously buttery. The sides we got were the Pan Fried Corn, the Au Gratin Potatoes, and the Mac and Cheese. (we really love cheese) The corn was great and a step above what you think it would be. It is not overly buttery and is seasons perfectly. The Au Gratin Potatoes were again recommended by our waitress and we were grateful for that. They were perfectly cheesy but not overwhelming.  We decided on the Mac and Cheese because i keep seeing it pop up on reviews on Yelp. It did not disappoint. It had a crust and that melded seamlessly with the creaminess of the mac and cheese. We finished off with the meal with a complimentary Apple Pie A La Mode since were celebrating my dad's birthday. The pie was warm and was filled with very thinly sliced apples. Even though i was stuffed beyond belief and told myself i was only going to have one bite i couldn't help but eat at least a third of it. It was great! Everything about it tasted fresh and completely homemade. This is a restaurant i would have absolutely no qualms about recommending Rooster's Uptown to anyone."}
{"text":"You ever sit down after eating at a restaurant and think to yourself, 'That might be it. That might very well be the best meal I have had in my entire life'? Well, that's how I felt after finishing my coconut cake at Rooster's. If I chose to starve myself after this meal, resulting in my death, I hope they make mention on my tombstone that my last meal was at Rooster's. I will have died happy if that's the case. I was in town with some friends for a little getaway in Charlotte and each one of us rolled out of this place with the biggest smiles on our faces. We tried the sampler, split mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes. My buddies had steak, pork shoulder, and I had the ribs. I will make a trip back to this place someday. You have my word. Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Really a cool atmosphere. Stopped by here on a business trip because it was recommended. 

The environment is really nice. Great layout, although the seating was a tad awkward because they were apparently refinishing the actual tables that fit in the booths (the substitute tables were too small for the actual booth).

Ordered Calamari for an appetizer. It was good, but not the best. 

I ordered fried oysters for dinner. Not highly impressed. However the sides (potatoes au gratin and onion rings) were excellent. 

My colleagues split a batch of wings and a short rib. They had no complaints. 

I would definitely go back, but I don't recommend any seafood dishes as they don't seem to give you much for your money."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one afternoon and my team mates had built this place up so much that I was quite excited to try it for myself. 
Ordered a roasted tomato soup and was served a very rich and creamy tomato puree with salt enough to lower ones blood pressure level. Decided to let it slide and not complain, hoping for the mushroom flatbread to please my taste buds as well belly. Was disappointing to be served a very oily flatbread. One good thing about it was that the bread felt nice a fresh and was perfectly crisp, though that is hardly concession for serving a flatbread oozing oil / butter. I don't see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"#grilledshrimpwithbutternutsquashandhintofpumpkin #rotisseriesmokedandspicedwings #Firedroastedbeets #Turnofpraisecocktail 
Amazingly delicious!!!  Great atmosphere.  Service outstanding too! We loved this place!! Can't wait to return and bring family or friends."}
{"text":"Across st from Blumenthal/ Belk theater.  Downstairs industrial feel to a nice dark bar, st level. Upstairs comfortable, also the exposed pipes look. 
Great service. Amazing mushrooms app. Chicken wings very good but spiced. Obviously a banker crowd in B of A tower. NC themed menu. Very nice beer and wine selection. Will look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"I went here because it had so many good reviews but I was disappointed in the food and service.
The atmosphere is nice when you first walk in so I had high expectations. My friend and I ordered the scallops salad and shrimp and grits to share.
The salad had three tiny scallops and had little to no dressing. It was basically a plate of just arugula (I love arugula, but it's not something I would pay $16 for a plate of it!). The croutons were clearly old and tasted rancid. We told the server they tasted bad and her explanation was that they were buttermilk cornmeal, but I know the difference between a cornmeal and rancid crouton!
The shrimp and grits was super salty and didn't have very much other flavour. I doubt a southerner would approve of them!
We got a weak apology from one of the managers, but sadly I can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Rooster Wood-Fired Kitchen is one of my favorite uptown options near the square.  Located easily in the Bank building, super convenient.  

I've never had a bad dish here.  We typically order a bottle of wine, a charcuterie board, split a salad or meat, split a dessert, and consistantly leave extremely happy.

Fantastic wine selection and the waiters know the wines.  We go at least once a month."}
{"text":"Every time I walk by this place my hair ends up smelling like smoked meat for the rest of the day. True story. 

Finally gave in to the smells and decided to check this place out. Went on a Friday night without reservations so we ended up at the Chef's Table. I was glad there were no tables available, because my younger brother thought it was really cool to see them cooking everything and yelling at each other. We had a couple of different servers throughout the meal and the service was great! 

We ordered smoked wings, quarter BBQ chicken, brisket burger, mac and cheese, onion rings, and greens. The ONLY thing I was disappointed with were the greens, because there were like 7 greens and it was mostly turnips and tomatoes. Everything else was amazing! Loved the smoked wings and the BBQ chicken. They use a mustardy bbq sauce that is just delicious. The mac and cheese was to die for, and I am not even a fan of goat cheese. 

Ambiance was great too and they have a ton of seasonal features. It's a little pricey, but worth it for a good, southern meal. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"I can't count how many times we have passed by Roosters Uptown. Which is to say the restaurant, not actual roosters - that would be a different story entirely. Most often, it is walking by above, on our way to Founders Hall, but there are a number of times at ground level too. Every once in a while even on the escalator.

On one of these trips, we decided that we should simply pop in and see what all the fuss was about - and more importantly, if there was room for two more. As luck would have it, there was, but we did have to sit at the bar area overlooking the food prep area, which as it turned out, was actually a good choice.

I realize that this isn't for everyone, and if you're on a first date or a special occasion, you might want to sit elsewhere so you can gaze into each other's eyes lovingly or something. But if you're just up for a light bite and want to enjoy Roosters? Definitely a great location, as 1: You can likely get in, rather than waiting and 2: You get to watch the action and 3: You will likely get some most excellent service, since you're close to not only the servers but the chefs as well.

In our case, we just ordered a charcuterie board - and when I say just, it was a fully reasonable size, that had plenty of meats and cheeses on it, but was plenty to keep us going for a while. In fact, it had enough that we did need to ask for more bread. In fact, we got more of the soft appetizer-like bread and more of the crunchy bread as well, which was pretty awesome.

Unfortunately I can't speak to a full-fledged meal, but it made for a great pit stop on our way by. Maybe next time we'll make a longer visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food service and ambience!  I had Prince Edward Island mussels. Delicious. The oyster mushrooms--never had them so balanced in flavor! Will visit again"}
{"text":"I'm visiting and looking to take a group out to dinner the most annoying thing of a restaurant is not to have their prices on their menu get over yourself"}
{"text":"I LOVED the everything, I got the salmon and it was cooked to perfection. My sister went with the steak. And it was very juicy. We also got the side of potatoes which was very creamy and side of green beans. Those were very tasty! The atmosphere was pretty nice and it wasn't crazy busy around the time we went. I recommend everyone to go here you won't be disappointed! Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their wine list and appetizers. Owner/manager was very helpful in navigating menu when he stopped by table. All dishes suggested were great! Arugula salad - muscles and cheese plate"}
{"text":"A group of us went here before seeing a show at the Blumenthal. Great staff/service, great ambiance, great food! My husband got the short ribs with Yukon puree and I got the trout. So delicious with a great wine selection. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice place that has traditional delicious options with a hint of creativity, Roosters is perfect. It's on the higher end of the price range but delicious. 

A unique concept of the menu is that everything is al a carte, meaning your protein comes on its own and then so do the veggies. We had 5 in our party and we each ordered our own main course but shared 3 different veggie options - corn, asparagus, and green beans. To start we ordered a charcuterie board that was fantastic. 

Perfect for a night of celebrating or a nice out on the town."}
{"text":"I've been very impressed in my two visits to Rooster's. As a meat lover, any place that specializes in smoking their own meat and does it well it going to rate highly in my book, but Rooster's shines all around.
I've had their wings, roasted chicken, and bbq meatloaf as well as different sides. Their wings and chicken were both really flavorful and perfectly juicy (as I'm sure just about all their meats are), but if you take one thing away from this review - get the bbq meatloaf! It had a great blend of spices, was cooked perfectly, and Rooster's bbq sauce is incredible. It's sweet, spicy, and smoky without having any one of those elements be too strong. I got some on the side with my chicken this past visit, and it made the meal that much better.
The staff has also been very friendly, and the open-kitchen concept where you can see the chefs working is pretty interesting."}
{"text":"Really good spot. You must be the meat and cheese board!  fantastic!"}
{"text":"Rooster's was EXCELLENT!  

In town for a conference, and after four days of eating convention food and protein bars, me and my colleagues NEEDED a real meal.

Man, did Rooster's deliver - everything we had (charcuterie plate, wedge salads, everything from the short ribs to the tilefish, sides, and even the desserts) were unbelievably good. And the service was incredible as well. I mean, I travel a lot and eat out a lot, all over the country.  This may be on a list of 5 or 6 places I've been that I will eat at EVERY time I visit that town.  

Rooster's is now my \"always go\" place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the bar tenders could use a lesson in Rapport building. Tried to make conversation and they were too \"busy\" The one of the three was very nice but the other two...ugh. Don't go expecting to be wanted."}
{"text":"Work long days in uptown Charlotte and can't even imagine having the time to prepare dinner? In search of an amazing meal, short wait, great atmosphere and undeniable flavor? Rooster's is your solution. 

Exceptional beer varieties and the short Rib?!?! 

*7 stars*"}
{"text":"Wow!  5 star food, 1 or 2 star service depending on the day.  I actually ended up walking out.  20 minutes of sitting and my order was never taken, and yes the server knew I was there, and her table!"}
{"text":"I go here for the brick oven pizza. It's thin crust and delicious at a good price. It would be a 5 star for the pizza itself, but I have had some difficult experience with the service."}
{"text":"I've been to Rooster's a couple of times and have enjoyed it both times. They always have cool specials and food is great. The place itself is also pretty cool, located within the Bank of America building, really dug the vibe."}
{"text":"Service from the bartender to my table was absolutely PRO! Recommendations were great. The food was terrific and I will be returning. Smooth jazz calm atmosphere a few TVs to catch a game but 5 stars in my book. I will return and I will continue to enjoy this place in the near future!"}
{"text":"The food was yummy and the restaurant had a great family style ambience. The menu entails choosing your protein and then ordering your sides a la carte so it's great if you're in the mood for family style dining. Our table got the wings and scallops with Mac-n-cheese, butter beans and the kale caesar as sides. All were delish!!! 

The drinks were great too."}
{"text":"It's way to dark inside. The food is not that good to cost that much. One of the plates that we ordered was so salty we couldn't even eat it. At least we have a nice server."}
{"text":"The food was simply mediocre. 

I had the hanger steak, the portion was very small and served cold. In fact, half of the food delivered to our table was cold.

Some of the sides we ordered were good but it did not make up for the main plates that were lacking."}
{"text":"I ate here Saturday 7/28 at and feel the two star ranking of \"Meh. I've experienced batter\" is accurate.  I really wanted to like this place but it wasnt possible.  First the menu, I understand it is Tapas, was extremely complicated, did not flow well and was very unclear.  This was the worst menu I have ever seen.

Second, the food was below average, especially the Flank steak which had a chemically after taste.  Also the ceasear salad was almost unedible. 

However, the goodnews.  The Au gratin potatoes were simply perfect, covered in melted cheese.  Seriously the best potatoes ever.  CongratS!

Definantly not a place I will be back at, over priced for the quality of food you received, sorry Rooster."}
{"text":"3 stars for food. We're from out of town so we were excited to try this place out. Service SUCKED.  Our waitress dipped out and never checked on us. And it wasn't busy... Booo...."}
{"text":"Came in after a fun but exhausting Saturday white water rafting, zip lining, etc. Though we didn't have a reservation, we sat at the high tops downstairs and had a wonderful meal. We shared a few dishes- Mac and cheese, half chicken, bbq pork shoulder, and mushroom pizza. Everything was great, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Great service. Friend ordered an old fashioned and really liked it. Will have to come back next time in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Roosters is a good spot - a place I heard a lot about when I first moved to Charlotte because my executive would frequent there.  It has two floors the top which is more open than the bottom.  We had our Christmas party here, it was a little tight and very open as we were on the first floor.  The food wasn't too bad, we had a variety of aps and wine/beer.  I'd return to another event here."}
{"text":"You may have figured out by now that I have \"parking issues\". So, kudos that on this rainy, cold evening I could park in the garage that is RIGHT THERE and not have to get wet to get to the restaurant. (Pull in off of College). 
The hostess at the door was great and we decided to have a cocktail before going to our table as we were a little early. Unfortunately, that is really the only ding of the evening. We ordered Bulleit Rye Manhattans and they were cloyingly sweet. So sweet I asked the bartender if she added cherry juice (as they were slightly red, too). She said no, so I assume the sweet vermouth ratios were off. 
We had dinner upstairs. (We sat in a booth and the partition next to my head was so dusty it looked hairy...yech)
They have a great charcuterie menu! I will have to come back with multiple carnivores to get a good experience with this, but unfortunately this trip my pescatarian friend wasn't into that. 
No more criticisms from here on out. I had short ribs and mushrooms and my friend had scallops and wilted spinach. Perhaps too much butter on the veggies, but the short rib was fall-apart tender, and the scallops (served on a beet puree)were just the right size, with a nice sear on the outside. 
I asked for a validation for parking on the way out and I thought she said it would still be $2. When I left the garage, I paid $4, so maybe she meant $2 off. I don't give a damn, I would have paid more for valet- I just was happy not to have to walk in the rain."}
{"text":"New location off to a great start. Short ribs live up to their reputation. Had mac & cheese and au gratin potatoes as sides-both made with goat cheese and both very yummy. A bit loud which made conversation across the table difficult, but is you want good food and a lively environment it's a great choice in Uptown."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and discovered this place on accident. I've been to both locations and they are both fantastic! I've lived here 5 months and been probably 5 times already. The food is fantastic, I've ordered a few things on their menu and it's always good but I tend to eat most of my husbands pasta-it's a simple dish but it's the best pasta I've ever had. The customer service here is great too! I went to this location a week or so ago and ordered the tomato soup as an app without realizing there was goat cheese on it so I had to send it back (I'm pregnant) and the waiter was so gracious about it! We told him why and at the end I also ordered a dessert which came with flakes of brandy (or some kind of alcohol) so he warned me just in case! The prices here are also very reasonable. When I could drink the mojitos are very good! So far it's my favorite place in Charlotte and we've been to quite a few!"}
{"text":"Love this new Roosters in Uptown. Still has the wonderful charcuterie, but we were thrilled the night we went to get an excellent soft-shelled crab with fried green tomatoes.  Service was outstanding and the wonderful coconut cake Nobles made famous still rules!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and friendly staff, but I will have to ding you for what happened--

Came at the tail end of lunch with a couple of big bosses. It was packed so we shared those community-ish tables with other diners.  We ordered our food and waited and waited and waited.  We got our drinks...and waited some more.  Server came by and asked, \"Are you guys ready for your check?\"  Kinda confusing, because we never got had our food in the first place.

She apologized profusely and the manager came by to apologize.  They were able to fire up our food relatively quick and gave us a discount.  They apologized a lot. 

The food was pretty good.  I had the turkey-bacon sandwich and it was well-priced and tasted good.  Turkey was not dry at all and the bacon had enough flavor to complement.  Pomme frites on the side were a bit salty, but I think everything is salty.  Bosses' got salads, spaghetti, and some sides which they said were all very good food.  Pan-fried corn was a good one.

Overall, food is good, experience tarnished by mistake in service.  Decent recovery, but honestly, I expected lunch to be comp'ed entirely.  Just the egregious nature of the mistake calls for free lunch, at least from my point of view.  Apologies were nice.

Will I come here again? Eh, maybe not for lunch bc I'm not looking to have a European lunch that drags on for X hours.

dmo out."}
{"text":"This is how it's done. 
A straightforward concept that has been mastered. The smoking and grilling are to another level that the rest of Charlotte can't keep up with. 
Been here twice and was not disappointed in any way. 
You need to try this pace at least once because all the bother chains can't compare. 
Treat yourself and see my pictures."}
{"text":"I've been to Roosters on a couple of occasions and I was pretty pleased with the entire experience. The first time I went was with a coworker for lunch. I tried the steak burger with fries and he had the spit
roasted turkey breast sandwich. I had no complaints about my food but the service was a little slow, which is irritating when most people need to squeeze in lunch within an hour. 

The second time I went was for another company dinner. I got the BBQ chicken, assorted mushrooms and the butter wilted spinach. Every dish was outstanding and the service was excellent as well. I was also able to try the mac & cheese, Au gratin potatoes, and the gnocchi duck sugo and really enjoyed all of them. It's still not my top choice with all of the surrounding uptown restaurants, but I'm in no way disappointed."}
{"text":"I will be honest, I thought this place would be better than it actually was.  I had the half chicken, which I had heard was a must try.  It was a must not order again though.  It is not that the chicken was really bad, it just really lacked any flavor was was not very weel cooked.  It was that... \"Is this done?\" type of pink.

When you walk in the place looks great and I was hoping for more than undercooked food and horribly slow service."}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed with this place. The seating is all shared on a first come, first serve basis, and inside looks pretty trendy with their wall of wine. Our server was very nice, but it's the food that I found disappointing. The tomato bisque was really great, but the shishito pepper \"salad\" was lacking. The peppers were good, but that's because shishito peppers are good on their own. Same goes for the side of beets. They were basically just warmed up. A restaurant usually adds something exciting or pairs it with something unusual, but they both fell flat. Definitely not worth ordering those-you can find a better recipe for those veggies on Google. We tried the \"frites\" (basic shoestring fries-nothing crazy) with a sriracha aioli that was good and not too strong that it was too spicy, and also the onion rings which were good because they were thin, but extremely greasy and didn't come with a sauce (the aioli from the fries made them better). Then, there were the wings. The smoked wings came recommended and three of the four people at our table ordered them, but no one finished them. Why? SALT. The meat itself was very good, but the seasoning included so much salt it almost dried out your mouth to to take a bite. Though the ranch helped a little to negate that taste, it was still too overwhelming to bother."}
{"text":"I am not in love with this place. It's decent. I give them that much. But the first experience being bad with a terrible waiter who didn't know what's on the menu and couldn't remember the order, and a waiter getting me and my wife new drinks when I say I'd like to pay and go, makes me think are these guys serious?

The drinks are good. The bar tender is probably good. But the waiters man... I was loud and clear when I said I'd like to pay so please give me the check. Not sure if he even understood what I meant for whatever reason. I still will go because the group of people I go there with from work are awesome, and it's for happy hours. But I wouldn't recommend it to friends if they asked for a great place to with great service."}
{"text":"Love the open kitchen concept that they have. Service was top notch! Ambiance was rustic and comfortable. Food was good although a bit expensive for the portion sizes. The bread pudding was fantastic! All in all a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Walked here from a conference wanting something other than \"conference\" food. Wow, we chose the right place. Local favors have never tasted better. The cheese plates were new, interesting and great. Entrees were deliver timely and super tasty. The French bread pudding was the perfect ending. I highly recommend!!! Great meal."}
{"text":"I came down to North Carolina to visit some friends. They took us to Roosters and I was so happy they did. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. We had reservations and were promptly seated. Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu items and she was very attentive to our table. Between the the 6 of us, we were all extremely satisfied with the food. I recommend the pan fried corn as one of your sides. The short ribs were amazing! Super tender and they are boneless, which is a plus. I also like the fact that a lot of their menu items are from local creamery and farms. 

I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would eat here once a week, maybe twice if I lived in Charlotte! Everything was delicious and the service was fantastic.  I had a mixed greens salad to start, gnocchi with duck sugo and a side of creamed turnip greens. Can't remember what my husband had but he loved it all as well.  We were way to full but we shared dessert anyway because everything was so good.  So glad we did.  The coconut cake was amazing with creme anglaise and  chantilly cream!!"}
{"text":"Local restaurant next to The Ritz Carlton with a nice beer & wine selection. Wood fire grill yum! Mac & Cheese to die for."}
{"text":"Food was delicious my husband and I really enjoyed ourselves...food...decor...staff...everything was wonderful...our waitress Shannon was great...thank you For the great experience."}
{"text":"Roosters uptown in Charlotte had many many delicious options. First off, best tomato bisque I've ever had. Topped with goat cheese and basil oil. The wood fired beets, scallops and potatoes au gratin were to die for. We ordered olives, Serrano ham, salami and 2 year smoked Gouda and a country Brie. We will be back. Cabin was a great server! I strongly recommend the coconut cake as well!!!"}
{"text":"Good spot in uptown. Always has a happy hour crowd and good options for apps and new specials from the chef. Also good local beers on tap to choose from."}
{"text":"The water and bread  was great ! Everything else .... hard to tell with the baby portions !"}
{"text":"I recently ate here Saturday night, we wanted to eat at Cowfish but we had such a large group the wait time was so long!

Needless to say we hopped over to Rooster's for dinner....maybe it's that I had my mind set on Cowfish...or maybe Rooster's really just isn't that good - but I was not satisfied with the food.

The atmosphere is awesome - the smell when you walk in is great! Our serve was pretty helpful and friendly. They portion sizes they claim to be large are actually rather average. Everything is served a la carte - still not big enough portions to share if that's what you were thinking.

I got the arugula salad which was very basic - greens, cheese, apples, dressing - nothing too impressive. The mac and cheese was just okay. The BBQ sauce is pretty sweet. Natural chicken was kind of dry."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! My wife and I had dinner here before a show at Blumenthal. It is extremely convenient to the theater which is a big plus. We started out with a sampler of various meats, cheeses and olives served with some toasted bread. Everything was simply fantastic. Great flavors that complimented each other. You can put this sampler platter together yourself but we weren't sure what some of the possibilities were so we let our waiter Chris pick everything out. He did a great job and was very knowledgeable about the different cheeses and meats. We absolutely loved his choices. 
For a main dish my wife had the gnocchi and they were some of the best I have ever tried. They are soft and doughy like fresh homemade gnocchi should be and the sauce was wonderful. I had the BBQ half chicken and a side of au gratin potatoes. The chicken was out of this world and the potatoes were equally as good.
The price/portion point seems reasonable for the quality of the food. If you haven't tried this restaurant it should be at the top of your list- truly a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here on Saturday with nine of my friends and I can't say enough great things about this place!  Service was exceptional and the food was even better!  Since moving to Charlotte I've struggled to find good, simple, fresh food done well in uptown and Rooster's ended that search!   Everyone loved the food and all the efforts of the staff who took care of our large party of 10.  I don't normally like BBQ chicken but I LOVED it here in addition to the side of mushrooms and Mac & Cheese!  I will certainly be back!  Thanks Rooster's for helping make my 31st exceptional!"}
{"text":"Went to Rooster's with a group of 9 for New Year's Eve- could not reserve a table upstairs but they were able to easily accommodate us at the bar tables downstairs. Food was amazing we all got something different- tried the ducks wings (my favorite), mushroom pizza, quarter chicken and all were outstanding. The drink list has a great variety-but our server was less than attentive so we did not have the opportunity to order too many drinks. We will definitely return with hopes of having better service."}
{"text":"Roosters' downstairs bar provides a convenient place to meet after work along with a good atmosphere to catch up with coworkers.

Where Roosters falls short is competitive  pricing on drinks to retain their audience long term.

Finding yourself short of $15 for two beers is excessive to a point where walking a block over to a place where one can obtain a pint for a more moderate $3 outweighs Roosters' location convenience."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for one of my best friend's bachelorette party dinner. The food was pretty good, but I wouldn't say anything out of the ordinary. Among us, we ordered the macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, margherita pizza, barbeque chicken, and scallops. The girls who ordered the mac and cheese, scallops and gnocchi were very pleased. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasty. However, the margherita pizza was utterly tasteless and the barbeque chicken was just nothing special. Given the relatively high price tag on many of the menu items, we were certainly expecting more. 

Service was pretty disappointing. It was pretty clear our waiter was taking advantage of the 20% gratuity included for large groups, as it was like pulling teeth to get any level of service. Water glasses were left unfilled and he seemed inconvenienced by having to serve us. 

That being sad, the atmosphere and décor inside Rooster's is great. Very cozy and true to the farm to table vibe."}
{"text":"This place is suppose to be that good????
Locals around me raved that this was a great place for a meal... But I begg to differ.

I ordered the chicken, beets and corn. It was just OK. 
I was expecting to have flavor through out the chicken. It wasn't there. 
Actually there wasn't much flavor and seasoning throughout the food.

And everything is all Ala-carte. Which is nice to do if everything is really good.
But so far what I tasted in here was just so so. So it wasn't worth the price I paid.

Sorry!

The staff was great and nice i just nice I just hope they season up the food a bit and they will have a hit.

This place is not dog friendly. ;-)"}
{"text":"In town on business and on foot so based on reviews chose Rooster's Uptown. I ate at the bar and the service was excellent. I had a delicious, refreshing gin and tonic with each in the right proportion. The Mushroom Fregola was disappointing -- flavorless and colorless. The wedge salad was better. Based on reviews I tried the coconut cake but found it way too sweet. Everything was ok but nothing special. I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. To start, our server was awful. Our first exchange from her was, \"What do you want to drink\", no welcome, no list of specials, nothing. Where we at some roadside diner?

Had the mussels to start. They were great. Good price for serving size. Husband had the special - pasta and clams in cauliflower sauce - he liked it. I ordered the hanger steak - medium from the gluten free menu (helpful) and the pommes puree (good). The steak was under cooked (my guesstimate would be closer to rare/medium rare with a cool red center), overly salty, very small (4.5-5 oz) and the sauce overpowered the flavor of the meat. It was unfortunate because it was a nice cut of meat. First tastes were charcoal/smokey and then salt. The saltiness was not preferred.

Went again today (coworkers idea - said they did lunch well). Gave it one more shot. Had another poorly trained server. No gluten free lunch menu (not a problem - just inconsistent). Friend placed three different orders because the salmon salad was sold out, as was the sandwich special - we were sat at 11:45 AM. I ordered the meatloaf if it was GF (server had to check with the chef), if not I would have the roasted BBQ half chicken. The chicken showed up (surprise!) but was never asked if I wanted sides. Finally ordered corn half way through the entree and it arrive when the dishes were cleared. No apologies.

Lovely concept for a restaurant. Very poorly executed. I will not return."}
{"text":"Walter and I found this place by recommendation four years ago on another vacation. We went to the South Park location then but tried Uptown this time. It was worth the four year wait. I hope we don't have to wait four more years to come back! I ordered the beef short rib, au gratin potatoes and a seasonal greens salad with pear, pecans and a delicious cheese I just cannot place. The vinigarette dressing was amazing and the pear slices had just a hint of cinnamon I think. My husband did the wedge without Roquefort and subbed ranch. The dressing was homemade and he was thrown first by the flavor - dill. Interesting surprise. The bacon was smoked and cubed and very tasty. My daughter had the macaroni and cheese and our waiter thought to ask when we wanted it to arrive - with the salads or entrees. Anyone with kids agrees, this is a nice thought and good way to keep your kiddo happy! My husband got the ribeye medium rare and it came with a potatoes puree and sauteed mushrooms. He was shocked how tender; it nearly fell apart. The mushrooms had a great shallots flavor that enhanced the potatoes. My short rib was very tender, flavorful and perfectly portioned. The au gratin potatoes were delicious but needed just a dash of pepper for my taste. Perfectly timed, our waiter mentioned a dessert that took just a few extra minutes but said it was definitely worth the wait. We shared it - the brown sugar bread pudding with a smear of apple pear jam and a dollop of ice cream. A truly perfect end to a memorable meal."}
{"text":"I went here for a relaxing lunch, drawn by the scent of smoke. As I was dining alone, I was offered a choice of a seat by the cooking area (a backless stool) or a booth. I chose the booth, as those stools looked very uncomfortable. The upstairs has dining tables and the cooking area for seating. The place is dim and reasonably quiet, very stark, almost monastic decor. I had my heart set on shrimp and grits, but wanted the waiter's opinion on what was best. After learning he felt the shrimp and grits were the best in CLT, I went for it. As the menu advertised they had bread baked special for them at King's Bakery, I was surprised no bread basket was offered or provided. My food arrived and it looked and smelled amazing. Four shrimp, some andouille sausage and grits in a spicy red sauce. The grits were very coarsely ground, which became an issue, as I kept getting unexpected, sharp pieces of corn husk in my mouth. The dish was quite good, except for the grits. One doesn't expect sharp anything in grits. The waiter returned immediately after I received my plate and before I tasted the food, then never returned except to collect my check, leaving my order in the hands of the busboy (who was quite nice and helpful). The busboy offered me a dessert menu (I passed as desserts are $8 a pop and all I wanted was a bite of something sweet), got me my check and was genuinely attentive (something I can't say for the waiter). Don't know that I'll return, but I might give them another chance."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 40, and the staff did a phenomenal job, very attentive and friendly. The food was delicious, I sampled a lot as they served us many items from their menu. Calamari, just the right amount of tender and crisp, beef skewers, perfectly done and tasty, Mesclun salad, a little small but dressed in a fine Vinaigrette, Braised Beef Short Ribs main course, tender and flavorful  and I have to admit the Macaroni & Cheese was like Crackaroni & Cheese! To finish everything off I had the Chocolate Gelato - spectacular! Well done & Thanks!"}
{"text":"Horrible management. Bar manager is a moron and only carries beers from a few distributors locally which means customers only get a few seasonal options usually from the Budweiser group which makes trash.  The great thing for them is that the southpark patrons don't know their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to beer options or good wine. This is a open air spot but all that means is that its loud because the owners were too cheap to build a wall and keep the food in the back until we order it. 15 bucks for chicken dishes and pork rinds as an app just shows how novel it is to mall shoppers to eat someplace that advertises as artisnal. Come on.  Grow up.  A fake southern twist on cheap food doesn't mean you can charge double the price. But in this place's case, it has worked for years. Sad."}
{"text":"Short rib was out of this world amazing. Asparagus just as good. One less star because the staff weren't as friendly as I hoped."}
{"text":"Went to Rooster's before a show at the Blumenthal. Since the two are connected via walkways, you never have to go outside. 

The food here is always nice (mushrooms are scrumptious, and the beets are a favorite). 

Gavin, our server, was just the right amount of attentive, and the pork chop special was delicious."}
{"text":"I took a large group (~30 people) to this restaurant for dinner. Roosters accommodated us with the bar and the experience was great. The group was able to move around freely, order from the full food menu and get delicious drinks. Although the food service was a little slow, the bartender did his best to take care of the group for food and drinks. He was very personable and did a great job. The food was outstanding! The evening was a hit! This place is definitely worth a visit for a great dining experience"}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers after a long day in a team all-hands meeting. Local brews on tap. Food sourced from local vendors. Prepared in simple, yet flavorful ways. We ordered the charcuterie sampler to start. The spread of meats & cheeses was enough to get our palates excited.

But that's where the excitement ended for most of us. I appreciate what Rooster's is trying to do, but I agree with some of the others that say it seems a little overpriced. The bill was picked up by our boss & even if it wasn't, it would have been expensed, so while I got to enjoy myself I don't know if I would go that often if I lived in the city. 

I had the mac & cheese and the wilted spinach. The mac & cheese was creamy but lacked a touch of salt. The spinach was delicious, but there was a little too much liquid on the plate for my personal preference. However, when I took a bite of spinach with mac & cheese at the same time, it was a perfect bite. 

Meet some friends in the bar, grab a beer or two & share some snacks. If you're not used to this type of dining (smaller portions, farm to table, etc) this place isn't for you. If you're expecting 'traditional American-sized portions' find somewhere else. You won't be happy here."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken! Nice and casual environment to dine. :)"}
{"text":"First time there... will NOT be my last.  Hostess Wah was WAHNDERFUL!  I was there with my wife and 3 year old. Appeared to be a bar crowd and we almost left... SO HAPPY that we did not. Wah explained that there was another floor and the wait would be 20-45 unless we sat at the Chef's counter.  We chose the Chef's counter. I was knocked out! The service was amazing! Lauren was our waitress. She knew the selection like the back of her hand.  Chef Cody was a delight to speak with when he approached us (I know better than to bother/distract).  He recommended the cheese sampler with some great local cheeses.  When asked between three entrees, Lauren recommended the duck... IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!!! The meat and sauce were a great combination. The duck was tender and the sauce was a bbq type flavor, but it was not overpowering. Chef Jake and Chef Cody and their crew did an amazing job.  AGAIN, their service was impeccable! I truly believe they were trying to sneak up to refill my drinks. I cannot explain two of the refills.  Their teamwork is something to be modeled by every business concerned with customer service. Manager Tammy, Treseon, and several more of the staff checked on us as if we were the only ones there... they were full!  We could not have been happier!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was wonderful. Shared three tapas: duck, mussels special and tuna. Then picked sides to share. Everything you read about Mac and cheese is true. Sinfully rich but not so thick that it overwhelms. Roasted beets and spinach were a great compliment. Wine selections were also nice. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Steak sandwich and BBQ Chicken are my two personal favorites

Great service, great atmosphere and great location. You can find almost anything in Bank of America Center

Really like the open kitchen concept. You can watch your food being made...to a point

Make sure you have plenty of $$ to cover the bill. It isn't cheap"}
{"text":"I joined and friend for lunch here, and what a great place. The restaurant was packed, but we got two seats surrounding the kitchen, which was an added bonus! We enjoyed soup, pizza, and a few greens. The soup, tomato basil, was delicious. The roasted chicken pizza was cooked to perfection, with a nice crust, and a perfect size for a lunch pizza. A definite spot I will be back to. As for the four stars, are waiter was nice, but a little busy so the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"I gave Rooster's 5 stars because of it customer service. My wife had the smoked wings which had a flavor rub on it. She thought it was very salty, actually too salty for her to eat. The waitress took the meal back and offered something else. Then the manager came by and apologized for the saltiness of the meal. She admitted some others had complained about the same thing. Well she graciously took the wings off our bill. We were pleasantly surprised. With this type of service and concern we will certainly come back. We just won't order the smoked wings again. 
Oh yes, their mac and cheese was slamming! A true thumbs up"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Rooster (Uptown). I like the decor; the food smells good from the outside (love-hate relationship with that exhaust system... great smell, not so great for my hair and clothes). 

I particularly enjoy the bar area. I like the dark tavern feel, but with a touch of class. I also appreciate the chalkboard specials. I like small bites, especially since they are more budget friendly. Last night I stopped in to have a small dinner and ended up with the Beef Heart Bolognese. Yes, you read right... it took a long stare at the board and asking the bartender twice to confirm I was not seeing things. It's not everyday I see the heart organ on a menu. Basically it's Bolognese with chopped heart & liver. The sauce was delicious, and a hint of the distinct liver taste. The best part, however, was the gnocchi. It was fluffy like small pillows. $6 for a small bowl and it was very filling.

I was less impressed by the Rooster Nuggest. It's literally small chicken nuggets, made with their fire roasted chicken. $5 and there were a dozen small pieces. It was perfectly fried, crispy yet not too breaded. Sadly the taste was off... I couldn't even pinpoint exactly what was off. The meat had an odd flavor.  

The pomme frites was excellent. The service was ok. They were busy with the after work crowd, and with only 1 real bartender, he wasn't able to pay us much attention. 

I have dined upstairs in the dining room before. I also had the pleasure of attending a charity dinner catered by Rooster (it was to fundraise for The King's Kitchen, also founded by Chef Jim Nobles). I have always enjoyed my visits. It's nice enough for special occassion, but you don't feel too stuffy."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with this restaurant. Nice atmosphere, great food, extensive wine list. The one in South Park, however, is better. The mac and cheese is just okay at this location, but in the SP location it is the best you will have ever had. Calamari is great both locations but they give more generous portions in SP as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Rooster's as a fancy night out and it was amazing! My three meat gnocchi was incredible. We had the Mac and cheese and corn as sides and both were outstanding. The manager came by our table more than once to check on us and after speaking to my husband about dessert and realizing he forgot they had great reviews for coconut cake (I ordered the dessert on special - we didn't look at a menu), she brought him a slice to try. The open kitchen was very cool to have in the background and customer service was to a T! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rooster's a couple of times. The location and environment are fantastic. I come here often before going to Blumenthal since it's so close. Since I'm a picky eater, I won't try the chicken but all of my friends love it. You should, too. Their Mac and cheese is fantastic! It's large and filling so it's a good thing to split, but you need to try. 

My last visit I tried a gnocchi and vegetable special but was quite disappointed. It was spicy (which I don't like) but another lady did like it. My summary - stay safe and enjoy the Mac and cheese and great drink menu!"}
{"text":"Rooster's is my jam!  I've tried nothing here that I didn't like, but I also have some regular goto items.  The salmon is where its at, and the BBQ chicken is incredible.  The sauce is what makes it!

Rooster's has two Charlotte locations, both of which are excellent, but this is the Uptown location.  It is an ideal spot to grab dinner before or after a show at the Time Warner Cable Arena.  Rooter's is a Jim Noble restaurant; known for outstanding service, food, and ambiance.  Desserts are baked at the affiliated King's Kitchen and Bakery.

This location functions on two levels.  The upstairs level is the dining room and main kitchen.  Downstairs you will find the bar area with shared pub style seating.  Food may still be ordered downstairs, but it's a very different feel.  Both levels offer restrooms outside of the restaurant in the main building.  There are no restrooms in the actual restaurant.  Sounds odd, but it's the nature of the building.

Rooster's offers an exceptional wine selection, and many menu items are sourced locally.  Be sure to try the charcuterie board.  Meat and cheese selections change daily, but the servers can guide you.  The liver mousse is amazing.  Don't overthink it, just order it and see for yourself!

You will have to pay for parking in the attached garage, but the restaurant will validate you for up to 90 minutes.  If you're planning to take an Uber or Lyft home, be aware that their GPS always takes them around the corner on 5th where the entrance to the escalators for the second level is.  If you exit from the lower level through the bar, your car will not be there."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice, cool and dimly lit. Honestly, I prefer a bit more lighting. Wonderful variety of alcoholic drinks and desserts to choose from. I chose the skirt steak, skillet corn and onion rings. Steak-cooked to perfection. Warm, juicy and tender. For those that prefer a seasoned steak be sure to request..Oh my goodness the corn is absolutely delicious!! I'd describe it as creamy, sweet with slight crisp. Now on to the onion rings-wonderful fresh cut taste, thin and served hot. Our server was helpful, smiling, attentive and upbeat.Overall Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a duplicate of the SouthPark location, just different decor. Slightly more rustic with the downstairs bar. restaurant is on the second floor. Service was great.

Started with the cheese and meat plate. Tried the half chicken for the first time. Not bad but I would stick with the short ribs, scallops, salmon or hanger steak. Sauted mushrooms and scalloped potatoes were awesome.

This is a an excellent restaurant just lile all of the other Noble restaurants."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here to drink wine--I haven't tried to food, however, from what I can tell it looks and smells amazing.

Rooster's is located right in the heart of the city, so it's a great place to stop if you're out one night. We typically make it a post-dinner stop for a glass of wine. The bar area is intimate with a huge community table in the center in the room and additional tables around the perimeter. Upstairs, they have a large dining space with an open kitchen concept which is aesthetically pleasing.

Wine prices are fair and they have a huge selection. The service has always been friendly and attentive and keeps us coming back. I'm looking forward to actually enjoying a meal here!"}
{"text":"YUMM!!

Uptown, easy parking, service is quick & friendly. The food is delicious!! Completely fresh and local. 

Best Tip about this place: You can sit upstairs at the kitchen-side to watch them cook everything right in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"Perfect dinner downstairs in the bar last night.  Two specials-heirloom tomato salad and seafood. Both delish with  fresh from the garden/ocean flavor. Oh, and, fabulous friend oysters! Joe, the bartender was a fun and gracious host."}
{"text":"Went to Roosters this past week. We enjoyed our experience. It started out rough as the pork steam bun, one of the things we def wanted to try was 86'd even though it was early in the evening still. My biggest complaint is the menu does not give a description of how the food is made or if it comes with a sauce. I went off the pictures I've seen on YELP. This was rough because it really just hurts Roosters! The food was great. I had the hanger steak and couldn't have been happier with it. But on the menu it simply says \"hangar steak\". Our server was just ok, we needed drinks and couldn't find him. This was immediately alleviated by the manager coming by and taking care of everything! She was so nice and with her contributions, the service overall at Roosters was great! One thing you must do when at Roosters is eat the coconut cake! You can thank me later! Overall Roosters was great and its right tin themiddle of Uptown!"}
{"text":"Was referred here by a friend and loved it! The food was incredible, kind of a down home style cooking but fancied up. We absolutely loved it,  though I admit nothing on the dessert menu caught our fancy.

 Service was great too.  My friend ended up not being crazy about the drink she ordered and very politely asked our server to switch. This can be a sticky situation because it all depends on restaurant policy if they will do it. But our server very graciously brought a different drink and didn't charge for the first. While I would never assume to not pay, it's very nice when they make this customary gesture. Just good service and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Bar service terrible. Bar area smells like beer has been pored all over the floor and also a musty smell. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Love the food and the atmosphere is great. We come here everytime we have an event uptown. The roasted chicken is wonderful. Have been at lunch and dinner and both services are excellent."}
{"text":"Rooster is a really good place, with simple food, relaxed atmosphere and nice staff. The menu is fairly simple and allows you to select meat versus sides \"a la carte\". Everything we tried during our first 4 visits in the last 2 months was good! Some of the highlights include:
-Best mustard ever if you like French spicy mustard that will make you cry while you enjoy the taste of it. They do their own and because I cannot find anything close easily, I bought a big batch of it! 
- Best BBQ sauce, not only because it tastes good (a bit different than usual smokey BBQ flavors) but also because it does not stay on my stomach for 24 hours (i.e. easy to digest) ... also bought a big batch of it :)
- Really good cured meat"}
{"text":"I go to Rooster's quite often; it's actually one of my favorite restaurants that I love to visit when I'm in Uptown. I typically spend a fair amount when I visit, and make sure to tip well. But my love affair with Rooster's is over. I made a reservation for 2, but forgot I had an extra person with me. But I thought we can probably make this work. However, I overestimated Rooster's. Their response was no, sorry. They didn't even try to accommodate me. It was pretty much bye, very abrupt- quite frankly, It left me insulted, upset, and fighting back tears, and I've never felt that way before at Rooster's, or any other restaurant for that matter. I work at one of the large banks in Uptown and while I always recommended Rooster's as a great place to visit, I will certainly recommend that my colleagues visit other restaurants, restaurants that try to accommodate their customers."}
{"text":"We stopped in without a reservation.   The very nice hostess said she could seat us at the bar over looking the kitchen, which was great with us.  We had a excellent meal.  The Mac & Cheese was to die for.  Very creamy with just the right amount of spice.  I had the Black Lab cheese appetizer.   The cheese was excellent and the toast points were perfect.   We enjoyed watching the cooks prepare the meals.   We had great interaction with the Sous Chef.   He checked on us a couple of time making sure everything was perfect.  This is a most stop if you are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time last night with a group of eight people. My salmon, was excellent, flavorful and cooked perfectly, as were the potatoes au gratin. We shared a bread pudding with ice cream, which was the perfect way to end the meal. Our table was ready when we arrived. We were so well taken care of, in a friendly and professional manner, from the moment we sat down. Never left wanting for anything. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"While I've been to both Rooster's locations many times, this was my first lunchtime visit and guess what... 5 Stars again!  I'm glad too as there was some amount of reputation at stake since it was a team lunch and all I was doing ahead of time was raving about Rooster's.  Thankfully, and no surprise, they delivered.

We all started with a cup of tomato basil bisque and right after the first spoonful there were unanimous sounds of delight.  Lunch main dishes around the table ranged various salads, chicken salad sandwich and one special of the day which was catfish tacos.  Everyone was fully happy with what they got.  Service was spot on as well with glasses of tea and water kept full and enough checking in to make sure all was well without being overbearing.

Winner, winner, Roosters dinner.  Err..... lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Was in here for lunch a few weeks ago.  Were directed downstairs by the host and then got down there and no one spoke to us.  It looked like they were still getting set-up for lunch.  We had to get someone's attention to ask if we should seat ourselves.

Service was pretty lackluster start to finish including some confusion over the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.

I got the Pimento Cheese Sandwich with fried corn.  The Pimento Cheese was served on two big slices of well-buttered bread.  The bread slices were SOO thick that the pimento cheese got lost.  I just wanted more Pimento cheese. 

Now the Fried Corn was actually awesome.  Salty and crispy.  YUM.  I wanted a lot more of that.

The restaurant itself is very warm and comfortable in its design and decor.

I'd go back but I would probably try other places in Uptown first."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was totally blown away by the quality of food. I had the Vietnamese Pork sandwich, their version of a bahn mi. It was incredible. From the crisp freshness of the veggies in the kimchi to the incredible flavor from the pork and its spit-roasted crust, this sandwich was, pardon the pun, \"the bahm.\" Can't wait to eat here for dinner soon!"}
