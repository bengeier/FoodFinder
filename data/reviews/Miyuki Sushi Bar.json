{"text":"Je donnerais Miyuki 3.5 étoiles, mais on ne peut pas. Mais c'est définitivement pas un 4 étoiles. C'est le plus beau restaurant à Sushi de l'est de la rive-sud de Montréal. Leurs recettes de Makis sont excellentes, mais je ne raffole pas sur leur riz. Je préfère le riz de Zend'o. Un autre aspect que Miyuki se démarque: la qualité de leurs sauces. Pour le restaurant, les recettes, les sauces, je donnerais 4 étoiles si leur riz était meilleur et il serait en compétition avec mes restaurants préférés dans la région de Montréal. Je leur ai fait la remarque, mais ils ne veulent pas en tenir compte. Tant pis. C'est quand même une bonne option. Mais si vous cherchez des makis simples, Zend'o est meilleur à cause de leur riz."}
{"text":"C'est ma place pour les sushi le midi. Rapide et frais on peut commander et emporter."}
{"text":"Pour nous, aucun doute.  Parmi tous les restaurants de Sushi que nous avons essayés, celui-ci est notre préféré.  Toujours frais, service excellent.  Personnel sympathique.  Notre plat préféré, le TItanic pour 4 personnes saura vous combler coté Sushi.  Sans oublier sa présentation assez particulière.  Vous êtes seulement deux, essayez le Princesse."}
{"text":"I had gone here for lunch while in the south shore shortly after 1130am.  I had to ask if they were open as there was no patrons in the restaurant.  The server said yes they were open and brought me to a nice seat by the front window.  I had the lunch special of 6 pieces of roll, 4 nigiri and 3 sashimi as well as I had added a hamachi roll as well.    I was given a choice of soup or salad to start so I went with the miso soup.    As I was waiting for my lunch lots of people starting showing up and the place was suddenly packed.  Several groups and couples all came in at once and there was a couple others coming in for take out.  It took a while for my server to return which was understandable as how busy it suddenly became.  My lunch was great.  It was a very nice mix of different rolls, nigiri and a few pieces of sashimi.  The added roll was also put on my plate as well.  The quality of the rolls was very good as I would expect to see in a made to order a la carte type menu.  The presentation was nice as well.  I had only one tiny issue and it was I could have done with more than a pinch of wasabi.  Besides that everything just right and I almost couldn't finish it all.    The quality was very good and the prices were in line with what I was expecting.  I enjoyed this lunch a lot and I would return."}
{"text":"I feel that I've had quality sushi at a lower price before. The decoration and service do not really justify the price either. I think I'd be ecstatic with this joint if their dishes were 10-25% cheaper. I've been to upscale sushi joints before and for just a bit more money we got way more in terms of quality of food and service (the service was fine, but it wasn't as professional as one would expect). I would return in a heartbeat but without proof of superior quality, let's say I'd pick else where to go for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"It didn't blow my mind.  Walking into this place for a business luncheon, i noted that the interior design is very nice... airy even, perfect for a lunch with friends (new friends).  The wait staff was very friendly, clean, and helpful.    The sushi was nothing extraordinary.  I thought it was rather fresh, for a sushi spot in the outskirts of Montreal (an industrial area of Longueuil), and the place had some very interesting interpretations of rolls.  Deep fried dragon rolls, a roll with red eggs, ahi, shrimp and carrots... all in all, not BAD, but some of the flavor combinations were certainly questionable.  We ordered a large tray of a variety of sushi, and each of us had a salad or miso soup.  The salad had a nice peanut-ginger dressing -- a highlight."}
{"text":"Étant un de leur clients réguliers depuis presque 7 ans, je peux sans hésitation affirmer qu'il s'agit d'une  valeur sûre pour le sushi sur la rive sud.  Peut être un peu cher mais après tout, il vous évite de traverser un pont pour aller a Montréal. Si vous n'avez qu'un rouleau a choisir, allez y pour l'exotica.  Il vaut largement les 14$ qu'il coûte. Leur rouleau printanier au saumon est tout aussi excellent et ce, même si son prix est également près de 15$."}
