{"text":"Hectic an bustling. It had a charming atmosphere of a middle eastern bazaar, with a guy singing and playing music, and then a belly dancer came out to add to the fun. The food was all-right although they were short on plates... I guess because they were so busy. The serving staff were friendly but very hard at work. Also, patrons were smoking hookahs IN the restaurant, I don't realize that was a thing. Overall it was entertaining and I would recommend it if you'd like to try something different."}
{"text":"Beef Shish Kabab for me on New Years Eve. Tender, tasty and just the right serving size. Nice ambience, save the take out traffic which cuts right down the middle of the restaurant. Not for families with younger children. Washrooms are not equipped for the little ones, especially infants. Prices are not North 44, but can lighten the wallet while being  reasonable.

Would I go back? Yes. 

Did I love it? Not really. 

It was nice and clean. They care about the food they serve and were friendly.

Menu is here,

{"text":"Went to this establishment a while ago because of Groupon coupon. The service was nice, the food was decent. There was a belly dancer that evening, which is cool....but was not expecting it with parents there. They do have an lunch buffet option on weekdays."}
{"text":"We tried this place as our friend recommend it. We went to Jerusalem but the other location (ordered), hence this one is buffet!

Great food and great service. Everyone was polite. If you wanna try this place, come between 12-3pm for lunch. 

Would suggest friends and family to check this place"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in town \"Jerusalem  - Eglinton\"...(we've tried so far)

Love their eggplant with falafel plate. Coulab shrimp and Kafta was deliciously amazing.

Price range was appropriate. Would recommend if you would like to try middle eastern food."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Jerusalem Restaurant for years now. Their combination of excellent food at reasonable prices is a winner. I think I've tried just about everything on the menu and they're all really good. The lentil soup is the best I've ever had -- make sure you squeeze a little lemon juice in there -- that wedge of lemon is provided with the soup for good reason. The shish kebab lamb is tender and juicy. The whole sea bass is always cooked beautifully. The bourkan shrimp has a lovely flavour. All the appetizers are very good. I can go on and on. Middle Eastern food is trendy in the city these days, but Jerusalem is still our go-to favourite."}
{"text":"I was worried that I might not enjoy the food. But when I arrived with my friends and saw what was offered up during the buffet I was pleasently surprised. They had plenty of vegetarian options, though the falafal was really dry.
We went when they had a belly dancer performing. It was entertaining. And the staff were nice."}
{"text":"The best middle astern restaurant I've been to in Toronto !!! The falafil they serve taste exactly how it is in Palestine , I was impressed that I finally found the good falafil I'm used to, same thing goes to the hummos  ! Love it love it love it"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places !! My family always orders from here, its always busy and consistently delicious !! Wait staff always fast"}
{"text":"The Food was tasty based for what they had available, staff was very friendly buttttt the place was dark and dingy, the washrooms was disgusting with no toilet paper the variety of food seem short for a buffet, the DO NOT WASTE signs need to come down, people come to eat and not be lectured by your mom saying dont waste. I dont think ill be coming here again as this place is quite possibly on its last limb."}
{"text":"My partner and I have dinner here a couple of times a year.  The food is solidly good, but not great.  It is a nice place to go, good portions, fair prices, and you will enjoy the food.  You just won't come away saying \"that's the best one of those I ever had...\"

I do agree with the comments about customer service, which is acceptable but no more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible! The food was stale, everything was dry, no kebabs at a middle eastern restaurant?! For Toronto, I think they should do way way better! Don't waste your time..."}
{"text":"We take out often, always great food, friendly service and great value. The falafel is hands down the best in the city."}
{"text":"This will be quick and dirty.

The food was easily a 3/5. Maybe higher. We enjoyed everything we had and felt sated.

The service sucked. Our large group was dealt with impatience . . . followed by clear annoyance when three chairs were left empty (we wound up with 8 instead of 11 people). The owner actually came by to tell us to hurry up at one point.

That, my friends, is all you need to know about Jerusalem Restaurant. I won't be back."}
{"text":"For the food, it's 3-star. For the name, it's 1000-star!

Jerusalam is my spiritual homeland forever.

   
  ."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet, Too little size buffet bar and too much seatings. The food selection there were minimal. I prefer just decent AYCE sushi rather then this buffet."}
{"text":"The food was really good,  generous portions, various options and fair prices. The location and service need to improve on my opinion."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading positive reviews and i can say i was disappointed. May be my expectations were high. I have tried much better middle eastern food around the world.
In some cases, even street food would beat shwarma from this place. Try kebab platter from street vendor outside forest hills station in queens NYC or one block down to pahal zahn, you would know how middle eastern food should really taste like... now im getting hungry."}
{"text":"Dinner was a real disappointment.  Maybe it's just the curse of the buffet, but the roast was overdone, the chicken kebabs were flavourless, and the veal was too fatty.  Appetizers and vegetables were great; there was a very tasty okra dish hidden in the corner of the hot buffet, and the pickled beets were tangy and sweet, but it doesn't make up for the poor showing of the main dishes and the disappointing desserts (dry cake and an overreliance on gelatin)."}
{"text":"Spectacular shawarma sandwich. Probably one of the best I've had. The mixed one comes with lamb, beef and chicken and I recommend to get it with everything. It's a bit on the pricey side for a shawarma at 7.85 with tax but it's worth every cent. Look forward to going to this place again for takeout."}
{"text":"It's a good buffet and reasonable price. It's good for big groups and party."}
{"text":"the power went out and the debacle that ensued showed terrible management at its worst. the customers were kept  in the dark for an hour until power could come back on - because they were afraid of people skipping out on the cheque (i.e. if you didn't have cash - you can't leave) - AND the staff stopped serving while the power was out for the hour. AND absolutely NO discount was given for the inconvenience!! It took them about 30 minutes to find some tea candles to put out (not exaggerating - while this happened people were trying to use cell phones to go to the buffet)

. and since there was no power... there were no plates!!! (no power=no dishwasher - and I guess they didn't think of washing them by hand). a party next to ours had arrived and done one pass at the buffet when the power went out - and for this they pay almost 30 bucks each (including tax/tip)?!

is pizza middle eastern? because there was a predominance of cheap looking pizza in the buffet. not one or two - but no less than 5 types of pizza!! the food was very bland - few spices used. that baba ganoush and hummus was very meh. the meats were tough and tasted like they had sat for a while (this was before the power went out)

y'know the exit signs with the lights on them that come on when the power goes out? this place doesn't have them - which makes me think that this place is NOT UP TO CODE. when i say the power went out - it was PITCH BLACK INSIDE. 

I understand when the power goes out its not their fault. but there are better ways to handle things. I don't blame the servers - its not their fault the management handled it this way - and its not their fault there was NO EMERGENCY LIGHTING. 

i know its debatable whether they should offer a discount for a power outage - but considering they charged full price to people who ate cold food in the dark?.... the managers explanation for no discount \"if the power go out and you go to the bank - they give you nothing because no power\"
wtf."}
{"text":"The food is average at best. Some of the dishes like the lamb and rice were good. Most others were just average. I found a piece of paper in my salad which I don't think they intended to put in there for extra flavour lol. I also think it's a rip off that they charge $8+ for kids ages 1 to 10. My kids are two, four and six. The two and four year old had some rice and a few piece of broccoli and we were charged the full amount. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"First off, horrible service! The staff can't even crack a smile. You get small portions, the food tastes okay but nothing great, and my baklava was dry. For the quality and quantity of the dishes, the prices don't seem to be reasonable at all either.

I won't be back here again!"}
{"text":"very good food, a little loud at times, but it's packed and busy. no data coverage inside, i can never get any bars inside. good for health conscious people, ok for people with food sensitivities/food allergies (except i'm pretty sure they use concentrated lemon juice in the chicken, rice and eggplant dishes, so not good for sulphite sufferers). The falafel are always yummy."}
{"text":"Went here with friends on a friday night. Its my second time at this location. 
I was highly disappointed with the quality of the food. They did not have any kebabs. I kept asking and I kept getting the response that they ran out and were making some quickly in the back. We were there for 2.5 hrs, never did see those kebabs.
The chicken and salmon kebabs were terrible, tasteless, lacking in the quality of meat. The lamb shank and yellow rice with chicken were the beat things there. I tried one salad, which was good. The salad area looked pretty unkept and was prolly sitting there for several hours.
The entertainment was uber loud, but not bad. Just don't plan on having any conversations during the entertainment.
The service was lacking. The one who seemed to be the head waiter was fairly rude ans dismissive...I had to ask myself if I was eating for free at this place haha. There were plates galore collecting on our table. The lady kept taking plates off every other table and walking past ours...almost like we were invisible, very odd. He to ask for water on two occassions.
Our friends found $40 on the floor at the front, while paying the bill. After checking to make sure it wasn't ours, we handed it to the rude waiter, he said thanks. The belly dancer passed by a couple mins ago, so we told him its most likely hers and he said something dismissive again. 
Overall, we had great company so we had a good time, but I'm not returning here and paying $24.99 plus tax for this sort of food and service. Too bad cause I always loved Jerusalem! Moving on, Paramount it is!"}
{"text":"A disaster. Twice they have told us to wait over an hour for a scheduled pickup order that was ordered hours before. A dozen other people waiting in line with the same complaint. This longstanding restaurant needs to learn how to handle their supply and demand catastrophe."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant. Been eating here for honestly 15+ years. Hummus, fried tomatoes, eggplant, lentil soup are absolute must haves. My family typically shares two dozen falafel but I order a main usually shish kabob beef. Meatis always very tendered. The saffron rice served is great too. Inexpensive meal. Today was $119 +tip for 6 hungry people with leftovers. Comforting food here. Beware of Sunday night crowds!!!"}
{"text":"Overcrowded, too loud, food was mediocre and lack of variety as compared to similar restaurants."}
{"text":"The  food is pretty good. Not 100% authentic, but, I still like it. We had lunch and the prices were good. Our only issue: we asked for a little bit of yogurt with our eggplants. The waitress brought a tiny amount of yogurt and never told us that there was a $2 charge for it. They basically charged us $2 for a spoon of yogurt. It felt like the management was trying to make as much money as they could and that didn't feel good at a place we go very often.

We were at Jerusalem again yesterday because people we met wanted to go there. We had the same waitress; cold, no smile, unfriendly. And this time, they charged us $2.95 for a small cup of yogurt. I can NOT stand this place anymore. If someone else recommends  that we meet there, I will totally refuse it. 

They lost so much business because of being cheap  and trying to get every penny out of us. There is so many more places with better service."}
{"text":"Great food, good selection, and  helpful wait staff. 

Food was fresh and plenty. Staff is fast and friendly. Would definitely come back again. Music and Belly dancing was a plus."}
{"text":"Yum!! Never disappointed in the food. Lots of vegetarian options for me and meat options for my bf. Even better on a week day evening as it is $5 cheaper."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast, quick service as well. The staff know the menu inside and out and are always very polite. The food is always consistent (which is important) you always know what you're getting.
The beef skewer plate is delicious. The salad is excellent, not to mention the awesome pita/pickle/hot pepper/olive platter they serve as a free appetizer.
In my experience, the meat and chicken are always very juicy and fresh - never dry.
The place is usually jam packed on Friday nights/weekends. Sometimes the lineup extends outside. So get there either earlier for dinner (5ish) or come later (after 8:30pm), or you likely won't get a table. Not sure if they take reservations.
My only complaint is the restaurant itself is old and needs a refresh."}
{"text":"Average middle eastern food. They seemed under staffed today. The service was slow and they forgot my drink entirely.   I'd stop here again if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for lunch as we wanted to try some middle eastern food. When we got there, it didn't look very impressive. Their selection of foods was sub par and like some of the other reviewers, many items were too salty. There was little selection of desserts and a pathetic variety of \"fresh fruits\" which looked like they weren't even washed. 
What really turned me off was the cutlery and glasses were NOT washed. I could actually see hand prints on my glass cup as well as each of my family members' cups. Should have taken a photo as anyone could clearly see the palm prints. SO gross. 

I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Meh.... It's okay.. I wouldn't visit this place again or recommend it to anyone. Friends and family have been before and share the same views.. 

Staff are... ehhhhh.. 

There are a lot of options in their buffet - unfortunately - all of it pretty much falls under the category of -- okay. More so quantity as opposed to quality. We were placed at a large table for our group and had several old chairs that were nearly falling apart and left us on the floor. Usually super busy with long groups so you'll most likely be waiting in a long line to hit the buffet which isn't too fun. Lots of groups come here.

Questionable \"entertainment\" -- we were here for a large gathering and got blasted several times with feedback from their speakers and off pitched singing.. Of old school pop hits which really didn't fit the environment or food style - you would expect to hear something traditional rather than Backstreet boys or country karaoke.. It was totally strange!! We ended up leaving and calling it quits early when finally some traditional music came on .. but we were greeted by an old belly dancer gyrating around several old men - not exactly a quality family experience.."}
{"text":"I live fairly close to this  restaurant and have gone in a couple of times. So far the only things that i gave tried  is the lentil soup which honesty is probably the best ive ever had...a must if you  order this  is to squeeze in the wedge of lemon they  give you, i  have also had the pita and  hummus which is absolutely fantastic.  Im sure my star rating will go up as i try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Poor service, unfriendly waitress, food just blah, overpriced, won't go back"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past few years.  I've only had the lunch buffet and the take out.  For ethnic cuisines I'm not super familiar with, i think buffets are the way to go.  I get to taste tiny bits of everything, then go back for more.

Lunch buffet - good selection, everything seemed really fresh.  On the weekend lunch (can't remember if it was a Sat or Sun) they actually had an entire roasted lamb.  I've never seen the entire animal roasted, it looked pretty amazing and tasted good too.  Notable buffet items include the kofta kabobs, chicken on rice, small whole fish, eggplant, hummus and the hummus-like dips (they dont label them, but they have like 4 or so big bowls, the waiter described each one, but i cant remember the names).  They are delicious. 

The dessert buffet items were nothing special, the last time i was there they didn't have the baklava out, which was annoying.  They do sell the baklava separately for take out though.  Excellent rice pudding.

Never experienced the music or belly dancing.

The take out is pretty standard fare, a bit expensive, but very large portions from what i remember.

The price is a bit steep, but I find the quality of the food to be quite good.

I like going here and plan on visiting a few times a year."}
{"text":"Buffet had a good selection.  I mostly had cold appetizers, which were good, particularly the baba ganouch.  Warm pita at the table was also a nice touch.

The bellydancer was very good: professional costume, lots of audience interaction.

Will certainly come back."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now to the take out section.food is fresh, with hot pits and freshly grilled meats. Hummus is pretty good. The mixed grill platter s huge and along with a few sandwiches was plenty for lunch for 5! The sandwiches themselves are great for a quick lunch or dinner. 

There is a small seating area for the take out part, but it feels like you are sitting in their storage area. 

The buffet seems overpriced for what they offer, so I've never tried it. 

I would give 4 stars if it weren't for the weird seating area and the overpriced buffet."}
{"text":"We tend to go here fairly often for their buffet lunches. The food is decent and they have lots of space. Service is always friendly. Some points docked because last time I went, a lot of the dishes had dried food on them, had to go through the stack to find a clean dish - yuck! :("}
{"text":"So Ive drown by a few times but never went in, and now I finally did on a Friday night. The place is nicely interior designed. The belly dancing show is included in the buffet price and the girl dancing was actively engaging with the people while dancing and made it fun and entertaining to watch going through the aisles (although having watched a lot of professional belly dancing and been to live shows specifically focused on this artful dance she was not the best at it). The food being buffet style - depending on when you went to grab it was either fresh or been out for some time (chicken especially). Either way the food was very bland in taste. Being here once satisfied that mystical wonder of what is inside - because the place is nicely designed but thats where it ends. The desserts where all great though and they had a very good selection of foods (seafood, chicken, beef, salads, condiments, desserts, fruit)."}
{"text":"The meals here are always reliable. And they always taste great.
The biggest challenge is the wait for a seat as there are always many lined up to get in."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm with three other girls. Lots of seatings available and server came pretty quickly.
I ordered veggie platter and two skewers of kafta (ground beef/lamb mix) and I loved the meat and grilled veggies along with well dressed salad.
Friends ordered hummus with meat, some fried appetizers, and lentil soup--humus was awesome, fried appetizers (can't recall names) were so so, and the lentil soup was good as well (you gotta like the middle eatern spice).
Overall I would go back to try different items on the menu.
Price range isn't that bad at all (around 13 and up for main dishes) so give it a try."}
{"text":"This place was INCREDIBLE!!!!!

We got here after driving in from Chicago, and were looking for good mediterranean food. We walked in after the dinner rush and got a table in a couple minutes. The place was busy and Frank the host quickly got us a table ready.

The menu was really helpful with explaining each dish, and the waitress gladly answered our questions. We asked about the Maza platter and how much of the hommus and baba ganoush, and she replied about a tablespoon each. We ordered and got our food surprisingly quickly, and were even more surprised that we got way more than a tablespoon of each. The platters were so so awesome, and our friend got the falafal plate, which came with about 6 deep fried falafals and tahini sauce. Best falafal ever!

The staff was really friendly and helpful, the food was absolutely incredible, and the atmosphere was classy. Definitely wished i lived here to frequent this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean and MidleEast cuisine. Even better good atmosphere pleasant staff, Clean and tasty food. Enjoyed the entertainment the belly dancers."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0, I would. Service is outdated, just like the decor and menu. 

The concept of hosting traditional food with traditional entertainment is totally one that was missed. The food was OLD, filthy, reheated, and most importantly lacked any taste! And the cherry on top? There was a fly drowning in my dirty cup of water. 

I left regretting that I had to pay a single penny for this horrendous experience. 

Don't waste your evening in this hell hole."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here a few times. I ordered take-out dinner for my family the other night and have to say that it was meh!  We ordered medium rare beef kebabs and lamb kebabs. They were really over-cooked. The rice was good. Ordered Hummus and it was the worst that we have ever eaten. It was bland and tasteless. It had to much tahini in it. Have to say that we won't be going there again. Too bad as it's close to our home."}
{"text":"This place is good to visit if you are really hungry because their buffet is really over stocked. They have some dishes that are good  like the fish and lamb. Desserts are mediocre. I loved the music and the belly dancing."}
{"text":"thanks gawd this one closed!!!!
awful awful experience last time I was there
the N.York resto is fine, great actually"}
{"text":"The sauce was terrible and the beef was very overcooked it was like biting into a chip"}
{"text":"A change of pace from the traditional, mostly Asian inspired buffets around the GTA. The decor is nice and the clientele is surprisingly upscale for an all you can eat restaurant. They also have a belly dancer who comes around in the middle of dinner, which offers a little reprieve from the eating. Overall this is an interesting concept but the food is a little too heavy for my tastes. But if you're into high volume, low quality Mediterranean food and/or belly dancing you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place has gotten some criticism but I was at the Leslie location for a Sunday lunch buffet and I was impressed. Definitely better than any chinese buffet in terms of quality and healthy choices.

All the typical middle-eastern items were present however what surprised me the most was the fish and seafood. Sea-bass filets, whole tilapia, shrimp and calamari stew were the options on my visit. Definitely not something I would expect here but they were all delicious.

I thought the roasted lamb was very tasty and the rice that was cooked 'inside' of it had a nice unique flavor. The pizza with za'atar is a must-try. The desserts were just ok but I was stuffed at that point and you should be too after indulging in all the hot and cold choices that are available.

Service was great. My waiter was very attentive and my dirty plate from the previous round was always removed when I came back with the next one.

Sure there are middle-eastern places that serve a bit better food and desserts, but in terms of BUFFETS, Jerusalem is a prime choice. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We lunched here today, and I must say, I expected much better variety of dishes than were available. There was no authentic mediterranean dishes like Shawarma's, Kabobs, Baklava, etc. Most dishes were vegetarian, and the variety of non-veg was very poor. I've lived in multiple middle east countries, and I've enjoyed much better food there compared to what we had for lunch here."}
{"text":"Great food, good for takeout. Incredible falafel deals."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Clean restaurant. Food quality is good. Service is good. Suitable for family or office dine-in experience"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto Canada, to visit my sister, according to her, this restaurant was recommended by friends. It was buffet restaurant for $23 ? per person? what a ripoff and you get charge $3 dollars more after 8 pm on a saturday night. As for me, the saturday night buffet is just worth $12 the most I will pay.. The food was not that great either. I have been to a lot of middle eastern joints(hole in the wall) and they taste better than this place. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants I have been eating at for as long as I can remember.  Established in the early 70s, the Eglinton Avenue West location has stood in exactly the same spot since its inception (along with Baskin Robbins) serving reliably tasty middle eastern fare.  My favourite menu item is the whole sea bass deep fried with a light, garlic-y, richly seasoned crust served either with rice or fries (rice is a little salty but goes well with the fish).  The meal comes with tahini, sauce, mixed pickles (beets, hot peppers, pickles) a delicious mixed green salad with mint and parsley and an ample serving of either regular or whole wheat pita bread (the best I've tasted in Toronto).  Home-made hot sauce akin to a harissa paste is delicious and available on request.  There isn't another dish like this in mid-town Toronto to my knowledge-certainly not for the price ($25.00 including tax).  The hummus is also great as is the tabouleh and the babaganoush (though the latter has a particularly pungent eggplant flavour).  Shish Kabob dinners are always very fresh and cooked exactly as ordered.  The falafels are tasty but definitely not short on grease and salt-certainly a flavourful treat.  Staff are efficient and responsible and the place is pretty much always busy-sometimes scarily so (last witnessed just before passover and over Easter Weekend).  It seems however that the eat-in customers get the short end of the stick, pleasant enough as the restaurant is in terms of its ambience and wait staff.  This place does HUGE take-out business with those in and out of the neighbourhood and has for decades."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I am a fan of it.  There buffet is good with far price.  I go once or twice a month and enjoy a good time in there"}
{"text":"I think their falafel from the takeout counter is one of the best deals in North York for falafel."}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT at all like the North York location. It's completely different. The food was mediocre and as a vegetarian, surprisingly, all I could eat was falafel and cabbage salad. The foods looked grey, old, oily and never got refilled or cleaned up. The waiter was disgusting... he kept feeling me up ever time he came over to talk to us and kissed me on the cheek as we left... I felt really uncomfortable. The only reason we came here was because we really enjoyed the North York location and we had a Groupon for the Mississauga one. The waiter told us to not use the Groupon in the end because it was more money than paying regular price or something? Anyway, if you want to experience this restaurant, go to the North York location and don't bother with this one."}
{"text":"This middle eastern restaurant is by far the best I've been to.  Everything is fresh and delicious as well as reasonably priced. The service is fast and friendly, even when there is a lineup to get in.  The eggplant dish melts in your mouth and the lentil soup is amazing! Tried every type of meat on the menu as well as the shrimp dishes and they're all cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Wonderfully multi-cultural family run. It's our second visit and both times have been great. The food has been fresh and tasty. Tonight's waitress was attentive and welcoming. This is a great Middle-Eastern buffet and would recommend it. Great last minute dinner choice when you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years.  My family and I usually order the Dinner for 4, but it's a lot of food so you always get leftovers.  I love their fried eggplants, falafels, tabouleh,... I don't usually like rice, but theirs is just delicious.  I wish they had thin pitas instead of the thicker ones, but that may be my only complaint.  It's quite reasonably priced for the amount and the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Yeah I'd eat here again, maybe on weekends. It was not that bad, although some food were cold. It was pretty tasty. I wish I was more hungry when we came and did not have a sore throat, I would've totally pigged out. Authenticity? lemme remind you that it's a buffet restaurant. Would I recommend it? Sure why not. Belly dancer, haha that was fun, although I think they should only do it on weekends. It's kinda weird and awkward when the restaurant is half empty and there's a girl prancing around the restaurant and people seem less interested about it. All in all I had fun!"}
{"text":"Good experience. Although i expected more, hearing about from my friends i wanted to see what is all the fus about, it was not that special. But its good to visit at least once, i guess."}
{"text":"For years I've passed by this place, not daring to step in. I've finally reached the age of reason, where the idea of having to be Israeli to dine here is no longer probable. What?

The place is as big as a buffet, makes sense because it becomes all you can eat after dark. The service however, is anything but. You'll feel as if you're in a very large family restaurant. That is actually the fact, but I won't tell you how I found out. 
The place has a takeout section where it's almost like it's own individual stand at a food court. Well, it is that, by the entrance.

When you sit down, you will make friends with your server, and that's the person who's got your back the entire night. 
This place has some very macho food. Meat of all kinds..except for pork of course. On weekends, they got a whole lamb roasted, served on some kind of rice. Both the Lamb and beef station are manned by a chef to cut just the slice you want. The salad bar is extensive, you won't be able to try everything in one visit. 
In Chinese buffets, I always bomb my plate with every dish. I do that as well here, but more people tend to judge me when I do, as opposed to when I do it at Mandarin.
They got whole pieces of fish here, I still haven't figured out whether I'm supposed to take sections, or just take the entire thing. So far, I've had no fish. 
I loved the desserts here. It's not much different from any other buffet, but somehow it tastes better here.

The wine here are ridiculously reasonable. It's almost like picking off from a LCBO shelf (non-vintage). They got belly dancing every evening. Sometimes the dancer is nice, sometimes otherwise.
It's get pretty rowdy on the weekends. The MC will wish whoever has a birthday a happy birthday. He will also sing you the birthday song...to each person....I never heard someone sing the same song so many times repeatedly in what seemed to be one breath.

There is a bunch of hot married Women here on weekends for dinner, or cougars. I don't know, they're hot. Israeli, Iranian, Palestinian..everyone's welcome here."}
{"text":"Bad service, once I came before 2 hrs of the closing, and they were like \"we cannot take customer, we're goin to close\" 
I was frustrated! And asked them, why? It doesnt say your closing now?! They claimed that in th week day we close earlier than the stated time!! Will at least mention that!
It is a family enjoyable place, because of the belly- dancer. But not a good food place!"}
{"text":"Nice place to have a meal and if you have Groupon like Bernie C did then its even awesomer place to eat. Ok Lets get down to logistics:

I went their on a Saturday as my friend was having a bachelor party so we wanted diner with entertainment.

The Food: They have a lot of variety as it was a buffet. there lamb was soooo tender and tasty. their grill fish was quite good as it went well with rice and hummus. Their desert choices were quite decent as well. 

Service: Our server was really great and accommodating with separate billing. She was give with bring drinks to the table. Gave us 2 free bottles of water for the groom to be as he was out of it on his first stop :D

Entertainment: the singer was quite good and was sing some in Arabic and some of them were quite famous as I have heard them as well. The belly dancer was quite good and was interacting with the customer pulling them to the floor to bust some moves with her. 

Washrooms: were kept quite clean.

Price Point: compared to other similar providing restaurant its quite cheap. 

For my fellow Muslim Brother and Sisters - they serve halal food and it states on their site as well.


All in all I would come here again but would love to pay with groupon for that time ;)"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful and filling. Stopped off here with my mom for lunch. Hot food was hot and steamy, salads were plentiful. Agree with previous poster that it's a sin that sheaths and baklava are not available on the buffet, but the other options are plentiful. Beef, chicken, and roasts, 3 kinds of fish, and the lamb and stuffing should all be sampled.

The Tabbouleh had zing without being acidic, perfect balance! 

Total bill after tip, with drinks, $40.00"}
{"text":"Good enough
Quick take out
Kids love it
Very convenient 
Good constant quality and service."}
{"text":"I've come to Jerusalem restaurant quite a few times... I noticed the food quality has gone done a lot. I used to be able to come here and enjoy.... I don't think there was one thing at this buffet that I could say was good. The food didn't taste fresh. And it was all cold. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We were there for Dinner Buffet tonight for a birthday party, and this place is not how I remember. We started going to this restaurant in the 90's and the food back in the days were really great. We started to go less and less because of the change of quality but not to a point that we won't come back. I think this time is the sealer, I am sure I will never go back. We were there at 5:45, you would think the food should be super fresh since the buffet start at 5, well, Mussels were cold and dry, fried shrimp and fish were dry and hard, there were mystery items on the buffet without names, potatoes were cold and dry, crab salad taste off, most of the foods taste and look like they were leftover from lunch or the previous day, but the saffron rice were fresh and tasty, pita breads are fresh from the oven, carrot cake are nice and moist. We did mention that to our waiter but he was in denial, really disappointed with the food. We really love to support locals and family owned but this place had totally lose my support. Extremely embarrassed by suggesting this restaurant, please spend your $21 at any other buffet restaurants, this one is not worth it."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. We used to go quite often during my high school years. The borch was great, but I think the best dish is the gyro styled meat. Parking can be an issue sometimes in the area, but the little plaza next door with the magic shop and pizza pizza usually has one or two spots available.

Prices are okay as well, and service is also good. Sometimes they even have live music for that extra bit of atmosphere improvement.

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Anyone who writes a scathing review of an All-You-Can-Eat buffet and can look themselves in the mirror afterwards doesn't understand the concept of AYCE.  You're there to pretend like this is the only time that week you plan on eating for 2, even though you already went to Indian buffet the day before, and plan on hitting up a Japanese buffet the next day.  You're not there to be a foodie.

With that in mind, Jerusalem Restaurant is a pretty damn good spot to check off your craving for some Middle Eastern goodness.  I love me some baba ganoush and ate enough of it during my most recent visit to put Costco's family size pack to shame.  Plus, their falafels and kebab meats are delicious.  Like, I still drool about them delicious.

Now, I gotta knock these guys down a star for a couple of details that really should be attended to:
- Your pita breads have to be warm.  Serving me semi-warm pita bread is no bueno.
- Replacing tabouli salad when it runs out with... nothing, is a bummer.  I love tabouli salad.  I want more.

All in all, if you're in the neighborhood and you don't want any Asian food (of which there is an abundance), this is a great choice for some face stuffing fun."}
{"text":"The buffet is extensive but like a lot of buffets the food sits out for too long and gets a little dry. Some of the items were very pleasant to my pallet others less so. 

A friend and I got the dinner buffet Group-on, so it was very affordable."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT would be the worst word to describe the service here. I was here Saturday for dinner and I am very satisfied. Prices are also good ,,,Think for a moment if you take lamb from other restaurant it cast at least $20 but here we paid $30-35 for lamb, chicken ,beef ,dessert and God knows for what else... when it comes to food I am extremely picky but from now on when I want middle eastern food I know where to go. Just believe me people and give it a try."}
{"text":"Not new to middle eastern food, not too familiar as well. Food that I ordered were good, loved that pressed yogurt dip, house made flatbread had the just-about-right texture and bite."}
{"text":"The best Middle Eastern Restaurant so far, proper Taboule Proper Falafel and the rest of the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Was in the area and was in the mood for some Mediterranean food so decided to give Jerusalem a try. Was greeted by friendly staff and seated at a nice table. Sometimes when your eating by yourself they tend to stick you at the worst table but this wasn't the case here. I had the buffet which had a wide variety of foods. The Kofta wasn't the best but I found a variety of items that were quite good.  I quite enjoyed the fresh pita, humus, baba ganoush, and tabouleh. The Buffett was reasonably priced and so with the variety of items offered was quite a good value."}
{"text":"Came here last week for dinner. We ended up sharing a bunch of appies (lentil soup, maza platter, fried eggplant and sambousek) between the two of us and could have definitely fed a third person. The baba ghanouje that came with our maza platter was some of the best I've ever had. Service was fast and friendly and the bill came to roughly $30 (before tip, no drinks). Not super cheap, but definitely worth it. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was a guest of Ricky and Louis. The company was great and that always has an impact on the rating. When with good company you are not going to notice the little things as much. Their is a lot to like about this place but despite the over all good experience. I would say on almost every item there is room for improvement.  The décor was nice and comfortable and accomplished what it needed. The food was better than I expected but was lacking in presentation. Dishes were not properly labeled making it guess work to someone new, the regulars didn't seem to have a problem.  I think they cater more to their regulars and not to the newbie like me and that I think is a mistake. If they focused on the newbie's experience I think the regular customer, the newbie and the establishment could win. The carving stations always seems to be unattended, I wanted some lamb and had to wait and eventually look for someone to cut me some, I later wanted a slice of roast beef and the same thing, stand and wait and eventually had to go looking for someone.  This is one of those places that is good despite itself and that makes it a good experience but not the great experience it could be. I would go back without a thought.  We were here for dinner, I would like to try the lunch."}
{"text":"The food was great , me and my family had a great time but the customer service wasn't great , the waiter looked mad the whole time . But the food and everything else was great , definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"I'm really shocked that Jerusalem doesn't have a better rating. I've been coming here for years and years with my family - in fact, when I lived in Hamilton my parents and I would often drive out to the area JUST to dine at Jerusalem because we love the food so much. The service is great and the owner, Romeo, is a very friendly and generous guy. 

We always get the Dinner for Two combination for $39. It is so much food, between three of us we always have extra left over. What you get: mixed pickles, baba ghanouj, hummus, tabouli salad, pita bread, fried eggplant OR cooked tomatoes BUT we always ask for both because they are just SO good!! Their eggplants and tomatoes are really the star of the show and both are hands down my favourite menu items here. I've eaten at many middle eastern restaurants but never had such delicious eggplant and tomato in my life. I don't know how they make it so good.
After the appetizers you get salad, rice, and your choice of three skewers of either chicken, lamb, beef shish tawook or beef kabob. The rice tastes like its flavoured with a spice known as kebabiya - very unique and so, so tasty.

The place is often busy but I suppose the crowd that enjoys Jerusalem doesn't Yelp much. It's been around since the 80s and has won many awards for best middle eastern cuisine, healthiest food, etc. 

I don't recommend trying the other Jerusalem locations in Mississauga or North York, this one is THE best, the others are sub-par in comparison."}
{"text":"We had our holiday gathering on a Friday night and overall, everyone had a great time!  When you're trying to suit the needs of 20 people, you're in for a challenge!  You must consider location, cost, food, etc. 

Leslie and Sheppard isn't exactly the liveliest of all intersections, but given its proximity to the 401, it was the perfect location for those who live in all ends of the city.  I live downtown so by the time I went home, it was an easy drive along the 401 to the DVP.  

Holiday pricing was $29.95 per person.  After tax and automatic 15% gratuity, we came in at just under $40 per person.  As with most restaurants, individual bills was not an option.  That was completely fair as that would take away a lot of time from the server (who was very efficient by the way). Knowing this fact, all attendees paid $40 cash in advance and I paid the final bill at one time.  The extra dollars collected will go back to our social fund!  Additional drinks were charged to each person separately but it was pretty quick to settle up the costs.  Free fountain drink refills too!  

Now to the food!  I must admit, the food selection was decent, but some dishes could have been better prepared imho. The dips, salads, and cold appetizers were pretty solid.  I especially enjoyed the roasted cauliflower and the baba ghanoush (sp?). Fresh, warm pita was served to the tables.   Was there seafood?  Yes. The shrimp really should've been deveined.  There were mussels, calamari, and fish in two ways.  There was a big lamb which I thought was very well cooked, tender and flavourful. Some of the hot dishes were over cooked, for example the okra.  I love okra but this recipe didn't do anything for me.  The stuffed chicken was so tasty but the pieces were quite large.  Eat one of those and you're done!  Lol!  The falafels were crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  I had to have two!  There wasn't a huge selection of desserts but you know what?  It was just right.  Some traditional sweets and fruit actually was enough to end off the meal.  

Let's move on to the entertainment.  The singer and The live band were very good.  They set a wonderful atmosphere for the restaurant.  The belly dancer was fab!  She engaged with the patrons and she was lovely!  She had some mini lessons taking place table side and at one point, a conga line was snaking around the tables!  It really was a memorable evening!  

Booking my reservation was a breeze.  I was given some options and suggestions which were quite helpful.  It was a full house on Friday night with birthdays and work celebrations.  Although I'd give the food here about a 3, overall, I'd definitely recommend this place for a large group gathering!"}
{"text":"What a meal!  Ordered the dinner for two for $41 and wow,  so much food.   I personal think 4 people could have shared the meal while ordering another appetizer. The service was good,  although they weren't really that friendly, but efficient. The atmosphere was good and loud, families enjoying their meal and it had a very good community vibe.   I recommend this place for people looking to have a good meal accompanied by good value.  I wouldn't  recommend this place for 1st dates,  seating is tight and doesn't have that intimate feeling you'd be looking for, but come with friends with a healthy appetite!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed dinner as well as take out food here dozens of times, and can't believe I haven't reviewed the Jerusalem Buffet yet!

This review is specifically about the dinner buffet, and especially on the weekend, when they are featuring the delicious whole stuffed roasted lamb. 

And if you are vegan or vegetarian, don't let the whole roast lamb or the whole fishes trouble you, there's also a wide range of grilled veggies and salads and non-meat options to suit anyone. And in response to a couple of whiny reviewers below, YES, many grilled veggies, dips, and salads are served at room temp, not as hot entrees! (Duh?!?)

From lamb to kebabs and Seafood, Pizza to hummus and baba ganoush, as well as tabbouleh and Tahini and fresh-baked pita and garlic pita, this place features a full range of Middle Eastern Foods as well as some surprises. 

Don't bother with the falafel from the buffet, they don't hold very well in steam trays. But DO ask your waiter or waitress to bring you some fresh chicken or lamb Shawarma meat from the grill area and make sure you ask for lots of their intensely fragrant garlic sauce. SO good!

That moist, falls-in-shreds-off-the-bone, whole roasted lamb stuffed with rice is worth the trip alone, plus an assortment of all-you-can-eat yummy seafood, kebab, shawarma, and that killer garlic sauce and I'm already a happy camper.  

Throw in some fascinating Middle Eastern music from the keyboard player, as well as the belly dancer and you've got a really nice dining experience that may not be 5-star dining but is definitely a nice change, and a slightly more upscale experience when compared to your typical Chinese food buffet.

Go! ...have fun! 
The Mandarin will still be there when it's Grandma's birthday next year."}
{"text":"Horrible.  We had a purchased a discount voucher and it was still not worth it.  The food is awful and the restaurant disgusting.  It looks dated and dirty. There is carpet on the floor that is filthy.  The buffet had no skewers or falafel.  We have a second voucher we purchased and will not be using it- that's how bad it is.  I do not recommend this one- although I know the other Jerusalems  are supposed to be ok."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have been to in a long time.

Firstly, I went with a few friends, and the place demonstrated its lack of interest in providing good customer service right off the bat. This is because of that fact that just before we ordered we asked for separate bills: however the waitress informed us that they \"don't do separate bills.\" A restaurant having the policy of not allowing its customers to have separate bills is ridicules. Also, they don't except debit; which I would have found easier to deal with if the restaurant was just some \"hole in the wall\" sort of place.

Despite their obvious lack of concern in satisfying their customers in regards to convenience; I hoped the food would at least be good. They also failed in regards to this aspect as well. Everybody at the table found their skimpy dinners to be bland and tasteless. Also, for the kind of mediocre food that they gave us - and a small amount at that - the prices were far too high.

The whole experience at Jerusalem stunk."}
{"text":"Every year for the past three years, a group of us reunite to celebrate the trip we all took together to Israel.  Seeing as Jerusalem food reminds us of our trip, we always pick there for the reunion dinner.  

Positives for big group meals include: they take reservations with no minimum charge, they just plop you in the middle of the main dining room; you can get a set shared menu with pita, rice, fried eggplant, falafel, chicken, beef, lamb, liver, salads, hummus, etc for just $19.50 per person; midtown location for those coming from downtown and those travelling from the suburbs.

Food is always delicious and extra bonus! they give you styrofoam containers at the end so you can take home anything that's not been eaten yet.  In that way, service is really good.  I was a bit surprised today at some of the service at the beginning when we first arrived - we had made reservations for 16, and of course like any big group, 4 people didn't show up so I told them just to make it for 12 (the food was not pre made) and they argued with me a bit and tried to get me to agree to pay for all 16 guests.  Just because people bailed does NOT mean I should have to pay the penalty, although I did sympathize with the frustration, but they could have handled it with a bit more grace.  However, once my belly was full of Middle Eastern delicious, I no longer cared.   

When the waitress brought the bill, she had divided in up for us included tax and tip - also a nice touch.  Will be back next year when I finally become hungry again."}
{"text":"I made the trek to Jerusalem, took a risk considering it was a Sunday and a holiday weekend, but lo and behold they were open.  It is a crazy little restaurant.  It is  a hole in the wall, dingy, needed a good scrub, but you know, sometimes the best foods are found in these kinds of places.

A young man rang me up and I asked him is there lettuce and tomato on the falafel, remembering Julia S said she wanted more on her sammiches.  So I was being slick and ordered extra lettuce and tomato on mine and I ordered a side of tabouli.   


Jerusalem's tabouli was good, it was exactly how I like it, dry, not wet with oil and more parsley than bulghar. YUM!

The falafel I thought was average, I have had much better, but it was only $2.99, so for $3 I don't even want to complain. There was no lettuce on mine, good thing I asked for extra!!!  It was garnished with tomato and pickle only.    I got two sandwiches and a side of tabouli for $10.  

A man walked in and asked what the special was and it was rice with eggplant and chicken, it looked good, I meant to ask how much the special was, but I got so excited when he handed me my food, I forgot.  Next time."}
{"text":"Never had the buffet; only the take out, which is absolutely wonderful. I always order dinner for two, which can easily feed 3-4 people. Service could not be friendlier and the food is incredibly tasty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Jerusalem Restaurant for quite some time now and the quality of their Middle Eastern buffet has always been very consistent and on the quite good side. The ambiance is nice as well and on weekends and some evenings, they have a belly dancer come out to live music; which is a nice treat.

My wife and I went tonight together with my father and I have to say that their singer/musician was TERRIBLE! This is not normally the case but tonight, whoever they had performing seemed to have no rhythm in the slightest. He was accompanied by a beatbox in the background and he STILL couldn't hold a rhythm. It felt like he was mashing the keyboard. If the management ever reads this review, I strongly urge you to consider hiring at least a half decent professional. Speaking of which, today's bellydancer was phoning in her performance. Any youtube video of a bellydancer would outdo today's performance which was a pretty woman walking around and imperceptibly wiggling her bits. No real effort at all. 

This last paragraph isn't really a big criticism though as anyone of you who would come here would be coming for the food and with that in mind, the place is great. On most nights, the entertainment is mildly entertaining as well. ;)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Many of my friends and family are big fans of Jerusalem Buffet in the north part of the city. Earlier this summer, my wife and I were biking downtown and had a hankering and we always knew that Jerusalem had another location closer to downtown on Eglinton. We had assumed that they also offered a buffet option.

When we got there, we learned that there was no buffet, which was fine, we expected the food would at least be as good and perhaps it was best that we weren't going to stuff ourselves silly after all.

Unfortunately, the food at this location really isn't up to the same standard as their buffet location. What a surprise because you would usually expect the opposite in regard to a buffer vs non-buffet.

The food at this location is bog standard. Right down the middle of the road when it comes to middle eastern cuisine. You won't go wrong but you can do better."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. The staff were helpful. One thing I didn't like is the dessert section. They need to do a major change there. I would have given 5 stars instead. The place is huge and was empty Thursday night."}
{"text":"We go often, but what I need to work on is not eating so much...but I don't wanna and you can't make me!!!.. OK, now that my inner dialogue is done with its temper tantrum... This place is great. Such a wonderful variety of meats and vegetables and I love the lentil soup. Seems like I'm always craving some Jerusalem when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT IN THE WHOLE CANADA!!
I dont know where to start. First of all the whole atmosphère is not a very clean plave. Looked like in a middle of no where place. You dont actually have table. The tables are all attached together in long Raws.and this is a bufet people. You dont just sit once and leave once. You one to go a thousand times to the bufet and you have to move everyone in the way. It's stupid.
Ok lets talk about food. It was salty, it was dry and it was simply bad. You can't find one single dish that tastes good. Honestly me and my friends tried everything to find something good, but instead se ended up being super thirsty because of too much salt in all foods.
Anyway, let's say you go there for the music and the dancer? O my god! The dancer was super caucaion, she was not remotly familiar with belly dancing.I could dance better than her. She was nice and apparently people who were not familiar with belly dancing not really hated the show but if you are from the middle east, oh you are going to be shocked by how fake everything is.
The singer was not good too. The whole show lasted for only 45 minutes.
I still cant believe that such place even exists. 
It was so bad and we were so disappointed that we wanted to go to mcdonalds after!!"}
{"text":"What happened to the staff here? The last time I ate here my Ma & me were treated poorly by every staffer. It was before the dinner rush, the place was quiet, and we were our usual incredibly charming selves. 

As the place filled up my Ma said maybe we should leave. I said \"are you kidding? Our waiter's wanted us out since we walked in!\" Strange, but true. Happily the food was still great.

Bad-tempered service is uncharacteristic for The Jerusalem: anyone have any insight?"}
{"text":"FYI, I think this placed has moved to Johnston /521 just south of Charlotte (past Autobell on the right) in Indian Land. I cannot locate a website or other listing but saw it recently put up a sign the other day."}
{"text":"Homemade Mediterranean foods and belly dancing on weekends, can you beat that combo? Yes, its a buffet! 

This isn't a gourmet place so don't come expecting fine dining. In a sea of suburban chain restaurant menus, Jerusalem delivers honest food, clean environment and courteous servers. 

If you live in the area, you can stop by for rotisserie chicken and take homemade middle eastern dips!"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday evening and table was easily available. It had a nice decor overall and well spread buffet menu. It had a stage set for live music (but no one turned up to play the music). They also have belly dancer on weekends and some evenings! However, at the end of it... the food was no different than any Sharwarma place at street corner... The buffet for $28 per person plus drinks, tips and taxes, is a bit steep for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"What a highly disappointing experience. Atmosphere was highly lacking. We have not eaten at Jerusalem in years and fondly remember the days before they operated an all-you-can-eat buffet. Nothing worse than falafels sitting in a chaffing dish with no fresh crispy exterior. Blah. We have experience with authentic  middle eastern cuisine so this does not pass muster. Despite the crammed buffet area ( they need to create a more appealing area for patrons to get their food) and unappetizing foul odor (was it the carpets??) the restaurant was full of customers probably attracted to the novelty of a middle eastern buffet and belly dancer as entertainment.  I can only assume that these people are unaware that you can get better at sababa (a la carte) or la grill in vaughan. For the price I felt that it was pretty gross. I think the take out counter and bread was decent and that why they get 2 stars. Otherwise for a dinner out save your coin and eat somewhere else where the food is fresh and probably even cheaper."}
{"text":"Bland food... mostly dehydrated due to sitting in burners for a long time. All fried items for some reason are left on burner-less sort of huge table kinda platters therefore those items are cold. Falafels, veggies items, meat items are semi-cold . I donno why would u waste $30 bucks per person. Not to mention the semi nude dancer that burns ur eyes. Save your money for something better."}
{"text":"That eggplant is amazing! Totally rock that if you hit this place up.The bread is freshly baked, and the falafel wasn't greasy. That's kind of a pet peeve of mine. 

Service was a bit slow, but it was also pretty packed. The tomatoes were really fresh. A good go to for veg/vegans."}
{"text":"Good food and good price. The lamb and rice was very good and the shrimp bqq was awesome. Unfortunately they don't serve garlic sauce which was a bummer."}
{"text":"Such a great sit-down lunch spot, although as you can see many people are fans of the dinner. On a recent afternoon we went with the Maza Plate ($9), Vegetable Kebab ($9) and Fried Eggplant ($6.25) and everything was deeeeelish. Get a few plates to share and you'll likely leave stuffed and with leftovers, as did we."}
{"text":"After a five year hiatus due to travel I recently returned to the the Jerusalem Restaurant. 

The food was good and the staff friendly.  I must say though that the experience was a little less than satisfying.  What I remembered most was the fantastic buffet with lots of great dishes, especially the shawarma.  

Much to my dismay on my recent visit the shawarma was not available at the buffet but only as take out.  

In the same way my favourite dessert, their fantastic baklava is only available at the take out counter and not at the dessert buffet.  

The two best parts of the Jerusalem dinning experience aren't available in their buffet.  

In my mind this renders the Jerusalem a fine place to grab a meal to take home but its buffet leaves two specific things to be desired."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, once in late 2012 and the 2nd time on a Fri night. The first time I came was in the winter and it was packed. This last visit the place was only 1/3 full at peak dining time. The belly dancing show starts at 9pm and last about 30 min, this is probably the only good thing about this restaurant. Some of the food was ok,but some items looked like they had been sitting out all day. The salads looked dried out, the vegetables and meats did not taste or look fresh. The carving station had a huge 30 pound turkey and was unattended, how are guests supposed to get the meat by cutting it ourselves? Even the lime in my beer wasn't fresh. Some of the little cake pastries were ok, but even the fruit didn't look fresh. This place needs to improve on their food quality or else I wouldn't go back again. The website lists prices for weekdays as $19.95 and weekends $25.95, but they consider Fri as weekend pricing."}
{"text":"I've lived near this place for many years, but only been once. It looks kind of dark from the outside, and it's not much better inside. It could use a big spring cleaning. 

I was there for the lunch buffet, and I was underwhelmed by the selection and quality of the food. For the buffet price, I was expecting something better and fresher. 
The service was mediocre, and the food was sub-par in my opinion."}
{"text":"The place was very quite for a Saturday night. Got there after the belly dances finished so don't know how they were. The food was not good and the service was ok.  The desserts were also not something to talk about.   Will definitely not be going there again."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of Nymark plaza sit Jerusalem buffet restaurant. It's been sitting here for years, and I've been living almost next door to it for over 20 years, and today was the first time I came here.

I would say its a Middle Eastern 'Mandarin' type of restaurant. It's reminiscent of Middle Eastern food (not just from Israel), but it's just not as tasty or authentic. I actually prefer my mother in law's home cooking to this. 

Anyway, it was fun for what it was. On a Monday evening, there were barely 4 tables. Every night there is a Belly Dancing show (let's just say, I've seen better), although entertaining, it got a little awkward at a family dinner. 

The buffet charges $20 pp, you get a variety of cold foods, hot foods (fish, chicken, lamb, falafel), some pizza looking things, and dessert (baklava was decent).

The service.... was non existent except clearing our plates and getting us the bill. Most of the time they are standing around, but no one could help us pour the pitcher of water.

They do have a take out section, adjacent to the main restaurant. Falafel (was tasty) and Shawerma."}
{"text":"Food is good and prices and serving size not bad. Service could be improved. I still come here any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I am beyond disappointed.  I just returned from our second visit to this restaurant.  After the first time we could not wait to return.  Everything was wonderful.  The food, the service, the whole experience.  However, this time we noticed something truly disgusting.  We will never, ever, return.

They recycle the bread that is brought to your table.  We watched, for over 20 minutes, the waitresses bring bread baskets to the boy who was manning the bread station.  These were baskets they took off tables that had just left.  The boy threw away any pieces that had been torn and any pieces that were whole he put back under the heat lamp.  On two occasions we watched one waitress bring a basket from a table and leave it on the counter, then a moment later another waitress came and brought that same basket, unchecked by the bread boy, to a new table!

I also saw the bread boy, I call him a boy because he looked very young, talking to the manager/owner at the bar, then walking back to his station he had his finger in his mouth and scratched the inside of his nose.  He immediately went back to his station, without washing his hands, and started sorting the recycled bread.

I can't properly convey my disgust or disappointment.  This place had the potential to be my families favorite and now we all feel like we're going to be sick.

I spoke to the manager/owner (I didn't ask which he was) as we were leaving and told him what we witnessed.  He acted very awkward and said that he didn't think that the bread recycling was happening, that it shouldn't be, and he we talk to the boy.  However, if this was not something that the management had implemented then I don't believe the wait staff would be bringing the bread to the bread station to be reused.  They would take it to the back and throw it out with the rest of the food that was waste.  

Someone could cough and/or wipe their nose and/or go to the washroom and not wash up properly, then touch this bread but not tear it and it would be sent out to another table. 

If this is what is being done right out in the open then I am truly worried to think what could be happening behind the kitchen doors.

I will never return.  I hope they see this and change their recycled bread policy."}
{"text":"Overall quality off food was above average, (wouldn't say excellent) but it was definitely pretty good. I enjoyed the buffet while I visited on Wednesday afternoon for lunch. The waiters were great and attentive. The ambiance was great as well."}
{"text":"This place must have had a change of ownership. The quality of food dipped in a huge way over the years. Their selection is bland, dry and seems recycled from previous days. Their customer service is horrible. I dined here with my wife and we had to seat ourselves. There was one waitress who offered us water once and we declined. Never bothered agin to come and check if we needed anything else throughout dinner. At the end when I was paying my bill. I did not leave a tip and the waitress was upset and said in a very rude way you must have not liked the food since you didn't leave a tip. First off, she hit it right on the nail. But to actually say what she said is very unprofessional. Will never be back here again."}
{"text":"I don't eat or know much about Middle Eastern food, but because of the request of my boyfriend's family for this type of cuisine, I found Jerusalem. Reviews were decent, so I decided to give it a shot. We ordered 2 appetizers: falafel, sauteed tomatoes and for mains I ordered the Kabab (kafta). 

The sauteed tomatoes were so perfectly cooked with so much flavor oozing from each bite. Amazing. The falafel was crispy on the outside, savory on the inside with a midly chewy texture. That was pretty fantastic too. My main was a mix of lamb and beef on skewers, it came with yellow rice (saffron spiced?), and a huge portion of salad. Aesthetically speaking or plating wise, it really didn't look like much...but it was super delicious! I devoured most of my plate, leaving some rice. Price wise here, it's really affordable.

My boyfriend finished off his meal with a Turkish coffee and what I didn't know was that Turkish coffee is really strong, like espresso kind of level, but it tastes actually very mild and sweet. I had a quick small taste because I cannot deny coffee...coffee is my life. I tasted some cardamom and though it looks concentrated, really mild in flavor taste. I would recommend it if you want to wake up!

All in all, really enjoyed my experience here. I would recommend it to anybody trying Middle Eastern food for the first time."}
{"text":"Good food - lots of rice dishes and fish, chicken, misc. things I did not know but I tried and it was good. The lunch prices are totally worth it! Good salad bar too. Baklava is extra tho. A must try - excellent service too :)"}
{"text":"Went with friends on Sunday night... Food was dry, I felt it was like left overs from lunch. Service was horrible. waiters talk back to you and they don't leave you alone without getting involve in your conversation.
At the end of all of the bad service they force you to pay service fees which I think they don't deserve it.
On top of that is the over priced shehsha.
We would never go back again"}
{"text":"I've been to the original location of Jerusalem that was just down the street a number of times and loved everything about it ......I've only to this location twice.

Tonight, my friend Jill and I went for the buffet.......I think I regretted it soon as I got up to it. And truth be told, I don't think Jill really wanted the buffet, but I didn't think we could order off the menu.....There was allot of food but it was not labelled so for me I was not sure what everything was. There was a great deal of cold (salad type) items, I did try many of them and  some of them I never had before, but couldn't tell you what they were, as there were no signs indicating the names of the dishes.. 

The hot items were somewhat recognizable and the standard middle eastern fair; baked fish. pork & beef skewers, falafel, roast beef, and lasagna (don't know how that last item is middle eastern and it made it to the buffet - kind of odd?), there was rice, roasted cauliflower. 

They had some interesting flatbread/pizza items.....didn't try it though.....they had baba ganoush which they do really really well here and we ordered the baked eggplant off the menu because-its just wonderful ! 

There was a very large dessert station. however neither one of us tried it. 

The buffet was $20 each and we certainly didn't eat $20 dollars worth.....it would have been better if we had ordered off the menu...we would have then gotten exactly what we wanted which was Baba, Ganoush, Humus, Turnip, Baked Eggplant, Kebe, Tubule and all with lots of pita for sharing and dipping (didn't really like there pita - it was made fresh, but it was too hard for my liking.....

So all in all, great place to try middle eastern food because there is a wide variety, but you need either have someone with you that knows what everything is or to ask someone.

Not sure if I will actually go back ....there are a couple other places I think might be a little better,....."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for about 20 years. The food is awesome with great flavours. I recommend the lentil soup, falafels, and the chicken shish tawook dinner. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because of the rude and distasteful attitude that the cashier at the take out area has. This woman who works at cashier for the takeout area is miserable and has a disgusting face and work ethic. What a horrible choice to have her in the front representing the restaurant. She has no idea how to speak to the public and should be hidden. She is usually there during the week around lunch time. She is an older overweight woman with longer hair. I strongly recommend that she be removed as her presence just ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Had a Groupon to come here and visited with a fellow Yelper (actually, he doesn't qualify in my books yet, so he's my 3rd party Yelp associate).  

Good: Most meat is fairly good, especially the leg of lamb.  I also loved the Turkish kebab.  Other decent food items was the hummus, rice and eggplant.  Great selection of desserts, which I thought were amazing.  

Bad: Naan bread and garlic bread was hard and tough to eat.  

Not so good, not so bad: Decent selection but not as good as the Jerusalem in North York. Salad selection was not as big.  The ambiance is okay, but they had the lights off when we first got there and it seemed a bit drab.  Also while they have alcoholic drinks, they don't have a drink menu.  Reasonable price for Heineken - $4.95. 

Verdict:  I would visit again, but not sure I would pay full dinner for $19.95.  Would visit for lunch at the lower price though. Still better than Paramount (yes I'm a Paramount hater)."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!

Ordered food through Uber Eats and didn't get what we had paid for (missing 2 Chicken Shawarmas). After calling the restaurant all they had to say was \"Sorry, there's nothing we can do\". After speaking with the Manager, who should have attempted to redeliver what was missing on their dime, I got the impression that he could not give two shits about what I, the customer, had to say about this. 

Two people ended up having to walk over to McDonalds to get their dinner. And I had to take the time to call Uber Eats myself and get my money back. 

Server at Jerusalem: \"I'm sorry this happened, please come in some other day and we will compensate you..\". 

What the hell am I supposed to do about dinner tonight? 

Manager: \"We're too busy right now\"...and hung up.

Suffice to say I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"The best! Amazing falafels, pita, lamb, chicken, eggplant. Been going here all my life (33 years) and nothing has changed. The service is always great and friendly and the food is always memorable."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of my boyfriends friends. Couldn't have been happier that this place was recommended to me, I loved it! Walking in, it almost feels like you're transported to the middle east which is really cool. The decor was awesome. One bad thing I picked up in however (not detrimental or anything like that) was that fact that there wasn't any music playing!!! I think that could've strengthened the feel of tye restaurant even more, and is definitely something that they should consider introducing! Now, on to the food!

My boyfriend and I started our meal with an order of their hummus, and the waiter brought us some anazingly fresh, warm pita and an assortment dof pickled veggies to go with it. It was absolutely delicious, I could've eaten just that and I would've been satisfied! 

For our mains, I ordered the chicken skewers, which came with a side of rice and salad. We also got the veggie skewer plate. Both were fantastic!  Chicken wasn't dry at all, and Tue seasoning and spices were perfect!"}
{"text":"The food would be great if it would be not so salty :( we couldn't  enjoy the meal because of the extreme excess of salt :((( if they will cut the use of the salt at least twice i will put another 2-3 stars ..."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers for lunch buffet. We came on a Wednesday and surprisingly it was pretty busy.  

It's located in a small Plaza on Leslie with an esso station. 
The seating is spaced out nicely, and natural light came through from the window ceiling above us. 

The buffet area is in a small corner with a table with salad, 2 side tables for hot foods, a small table for pizza, and another table for desserts. 
The desserts and salad buffet table were back to back, and the alley can only fit one person, so if someone is getting desserts, the other person cannot get salads. 

There was a small fruit station set up with fresh whole fruits like pears, apples, bananas. 

The salads had a wide variety, they were all pre mixed. I enjoyed the beets, green salad and crab salad.  There were also dips like hummus, babaganouch (this was my favourite).  The waiter will bring you a basket of flat bread.  The one that is crunchy with some garlic brushed on was so good!!!! 

The hot foods had a variety or eggplants, okra, Kofta, lasagna, whole Tilapia, grilled vegetables. 
There isn't a big selection, but the ones available were very good.  

The service was very good, waiter took away plates before we came back with our new plates. 

I saw on the menu outside that every night they have belly dancing. Nice place to come for dinner and entertainment."}
{"text":"This place has great takeout, funny, friendly staff,  and if you choose to go to the restaurant , they have belly dancing by a woman with crazy abs!"}
{"text":"Great place for buffet! Lots of vegetarian and meat options. Desserts are regular for a buffet. They have a whole tilapia fish for you to take at the buffet!"}
{"text":"Totally meh. Salads were ok but frequently over salted. No veg options in hot food and no hot veg dishes other than potatoes. Deserts were totally underwhelming, especially the hospital cup jello shoots. 

Markham location is so much better. 

Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews for this place are so all over the board. The food, while not the best Middle Eastern place I've ever had, is still pretty good. I ordered the Jerusalem steak, which was super juicy and delicious. The rice was buttery and tender. The prices are really reasonable, and the parking is convenient. OTOH, the service is kinda slow, and they don't take debit, which is weird. 

A good option for a meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so amazing! Been here about 3,4 times, and kept on ordering the same thing.

The dinner for two comes with an array of: hummus, baba ganoush, grilled eggplants, pita breads, pickles, tabbouleh salad, regular salad, rice, grilled veggies, and three skewers of lovely lovely whatever meats you want. I love the lamb and kafta so that's what i get. 

Srsly, the amount of food \"for two\" is enough for four. but i'm not complaining cuz now i've got lunch for tomorrow. 

recently we came into the shop on a sunday afternoon, it's one thing that the restaurant is really family oriented, another when a huge kids party of 6-7 kids were seated right next to us. so it's a bit...loud. ideal if kids parties and couple groups can be divided. i'm definitely never going to 5pm early dinner again. 

when in the area, give it a try. the food is really really so delicious."}
{"text":"This place has great food! The ambience and service isn't amazing but they have fantastic food. This is the best place for middle eastern takeout that I've tried in Toronto."}
{"text":"The idea of the place is decidedly cool - a Middle Eastern AYCE - never been to one before.

Our server can really consider a second career as a comedian - she was funny.

The interior is cliche-ish, but nice, with comfortable seating.

The food... Well, the food is kind of meh. If you're on a budget, or you are an AYCE place fiend, and you want Middle Eastern food (for a change, as most AYCEs serve asian food), then yes, this place is certainly worth a visit.

If you really enjoy Middle Eastern food, and know your way around it - don't bother - I certainly won't."}
{"text":"I have been to both their North York and Mississauga location for both dinner and lunch buffets. It is a good middle eastern buffet place with decent selection of food. I have not had any issues with the service as they were always prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a saturday. Pretty good! Ordered a kabab plate. Came with two skewers, salad and rice. It came with House pickles on the side. They were all good. Just 4 stars because it didnt come with tahini or any sauce of some sort. Service was a tad bit slow."}
{"text":"Let's be honest on this one. Skip-it! I've eaten food on the side of an abandon road in the middle of Indonesia, with the risk of HEP-A, and HEP-C, that tasted better. And they had this Belly Dancer in her 70s, who, again let me be honest, shouldn't be dancing but tending to the local bingo soiree. Never again, avert your eyes as the power of Christ compels you, the power of Christ compels you."}
{"text":"Really beautiful place! This is the non-buffet restaurant but it was honestly just as good! Service was prompt and efficient. The hummus and pita were awesome! Baked fresh and tasted fresh! Plus, where else can you get 4 perfectly grilled lamb chops for $20? Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"My first experience earlier this year was amazing. Specially their monday lunch deal was superb, they served kabab and the quality was decent.My recent two visits with large group have been bad to worse. They are serving stale and foul smelling chicken, the owner stopped serving kabab for Monday lunch. The food tray is filled with dry food, it just went south. I am never going back."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to the one on Eglinton. It features a Mediterranean Buffet. On Saturday nights it also features entertainment and belly dancing.

Firstly you have to bring an appetite. The food is rich plentiful and varied. The full range of Middle Eastern foods is available. They also have a good choice of vegetarian selections, particularly the dips and the ubiquitous fallafels.

My favorite were the Lamb Shanks, which were nicely displayed in the buffet. They were succulent! I also very much liked the keftas and the other mechoui (grilled meat). The fallafel are good but I have had better.

I natural ate copious amounts of the pickled turnips, always one of my favorites. That and a few hot pickled peppers and olives will always make me happy. If you are a grazer there is a nice selection of salads, and for the lady some delicious stuffed vegetables.

You can finish off the meal with some baklava, or some other very sweet middle eastern dessert. Its a busy place, not a romantic dinner locale, but the food is very good and consistent."}
{"text":"Good \"shawerma\" or \"shoarma\" if you are european.  If you like soft drinks they are by the can which can be pricey.  They have hookas for rent, but ill pass on the herpes.  Pretty cool place, reminds me of a hole in amsterdam.  I will return."}
{"text":"Update: I have been back several times since and they seemed to converted all buffet. It's a mixed bag. Salads and deserts are the stand out's and meats can be hit or miss depending on how long it's been out. I mean if I were going to have do a buffet it's a interesting change but I would still rather go to Mandarin or Tucker's Marketplace first. 
They have chicken shawarma lunch special for $4.50. I had it the twice just to make sure it was not a one off type of thing. That chicken is so over cooked and dry that you could use it for sandpaper."}
{"text":"I've had a great experience at this restaurant every time I've been here. The food is great and there's a wonderful variety. The service is spot on... quick and friendly and the price is reasonable for a lunch buffet.

The restaurant itself could likely do with a makeover but let's face it, I'm not there to look at the décor, I'm there to eat and eat I shall! I must admit, I tend to stick with the middle eastern cuisine and stay away from the more 'western' dishes like pizza. There's better places to go to if I want pizza. No no... when I come here, I want falafels, kafta, hummus, etc.

I have always had a great time here and I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Middle Eastern restaurant in Toronto and the place that my wife always seems to want to go for her birthday. If you know my wife (who is a big foodie, a trained chef and a bit of a dining snob) this is a pretty big compliment! I've been a handful of times now and it's nothing if not consistent: very good food, great portions and incredibly reasonable. Service is always solid. At the worst brusque but efficient, at best very friendly. So really no complaints.

The place is nice enough but I think it might be fair to say that it's maybe just a TAD rundown and could use a spot of paint but I think that's something many of the best Middle Eastern restaurants seem to have in common and only adds to their charm. In fact I think I may trust it a little less if it had a glossier interior, almost as though they were trying to hide something instead of letting the food do the talking. 

As for the food I usually order the same basic thing with several variations: the incredibly delicious lentil soup, something to dip pitas into (the hummus, tahini and baba ganoush are all great), some various pickled things, some tabouli and of course the falafels, which are always done to perfection. Crispy and crunchy and bursting with flavour without ever being overcooked, I can confidently say that they are the best in the city. Sometimes I regret that I didn't go for something different like potatoes and / or rice (which are very good here as well) but as soon as I bite into one of those yummy deep fried balls (balls!), I forgive myself for being so boring and predictable.

So it's a vegetarian's paradise and of course they have lots of great options for carnivores / omnivores (Honey loves the lamb skewers in particular). And it's worth the drive from Mississauga or wherever you're coming from, even if the \"improvements\" on Eglinton are a bit of a nightmare. There's certainly no shortage of Middle Eastern food in the GTA but Jerusalem is absolutely one to check out if you haven't already done so!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise this place was!  

A family member had heard about Jersusalem and organized a group outing - not one of us had ever been.  

Walking into an old-school packed restaurant, one feels at home and welcome. (Why fix what works?) The clientele was predominantly Middle-Eastern - a good sign. 

While the buffet area was a little cramped, they offered much selection and I was pleasantly surprised that everything I sampled (which, uh, pretty much was EVERYTHING) was very tasty.  They offered kid-friendly food like pizza for those who aren't so adventurous as well. 

Then, live music came on and out came a gorgeous belly dancer who offered free lessons, then a group of customers got up and started a small dance floor!  

A great time, family-friendly and delicious food. I'm going back soon."}
{"text":"I came here for take-out and it was decent. I ordered a falafel sandwich and was glad that I didn't have to wait long for my meal. I loved how they make the falafel from scratch and fry it when you order--super fresh! However, I wasn't a fan when I saw that the staff put the veggies that were displaced on the counter back into the container... I'm not sure that it's entirely sanitary. Either way, $4.95 for this falafel sandwich was almost a steal as other places charge about $6 and I was pretty full from this meal. 

Will I return?! Maybe if I'm hungry and I'm around the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Aside from Bamiyan Kebob and Paramount Fine Foods, when I think of Middle Eastern foods, Jersulem is my go-to place! Located just north of Sheppard Ave on Leslie, Jerusalem has been around for many years, and has provided a fun, yet interactive experience for those who've come here to eat.  

Their menus have a range either by a-la carte, or their overwhelming- yet a wee bit pricy buffet that usually brings a crowed of people.  The usual dinner buffet prices are anywhere from $22-25/person depending on the day of the week, but again there's a lot of food choices.   
On Fridays and Saturdays twice during dinner timings they have live belly dancing performances while you're enjoying your meal.  From koftas, kebob, and lamb, to taboule, roasted vegetables, pita, and humus, there's enough food to accomadate your dietary preferences.  The place is clean, and the service is always great! 

What's also nice is they also have an optional take-out area, and this place is very spacious, with beauitful decor :)"}
{"text":"Not only i love this place, theirFood is to die for. Am normally not a huge fan of buffets. But theirs is pretty delicious. It tastes like my Grandma's kitchen. Go on the weekends they have belly dancing. Its fun."}
{"text":"The best Middle Eastern I've had to date. The service is good and the price is also right. Their babaghanous and rice stand out far above the rest. It's in York but well worth the drive. You won't be disappointed as the ambiance will make you want to stay for a few hours."}
{"text":"This buffet experience was excellent, tried many things I would not usually have even known to order.  Food is fresh, joint is clean, not very pricey for lunch.  Once again, a great selection.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Sunday lunch buffet is amazing. Roasted lamb, BBQ meats, fresh salads, hot from the oven bread and excellent service. Highly recommended for authentic Middle Eastern food. Pace yourself and try everything. Oh and save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"They have a wide range of middle eastern selections. I really enjoy their lamb and naan bread. There is also chicken, beef and salads. Their fish is served in whole and each is so big that people can hardly finish one in a buffet. It would probably better to cut the fish into pieces. 

Unlike other buffets, every dish here is fresh and warm.

The waitress always cuts us short, while we were having private conversations. It is nice to ask the customers about their meals, but not interrupt."}
{"text":"Jerusalem Leslie is among the best middle-eastern restaurants in Toronto. I have been a regular at their take-out counter for the past 15 years. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. 

The pita bread is made in a wood oven at the front of the restaurant. All sauces and marinades are homemade. The meat is always cooked to a crispy, tender perfection. 


The beef/chicken shawarma, kebab, and falafel are all stupendous. At times, the falafel is among the best in the city, although there have been some inconsistencies (sometimes it is a bit dry). 

My #1 choice is the chicken kebab in a pita, topped with lettuce, tomato, middle eastern salad, hummus, tahini, and hot sauce ($6.25). The falafel ($4.75) and chicken shawarma ($6.50) are my next two choices - all with the same toppings.

The buffet is always busy, although I have never dined in."}
{"text":"A fantastic array of Middle Eastern foods. A great layout, fast and friendly staff and belly dancers. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a decent quality buffet (but only on the weekends) They have a wide variety of food options. The belly dancing and live music was a nice touch (but it was very short - it only lasts from 8 - 8:30 pm)  The weekdays are not as good in terms of food variety, quality and service."}
{"text":"This place has real ups and downs and is highly inconsistent throughout the multiple times that I've been here. For every awesome experience I've had here, I had 5 terrible experiences with expired food and a very small selection of items. 

A lot of the time the food during dinner was recycled leftovers that were a few days old. The instant giveaway is when the beef items look yellowish and the tahini is extremely gooey.

I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"A shabby place in a shabby location.  Average service.  Flavorless food.  Yes there is lots of food that looks good but does not taste that good.  And they charge more than the advertised price. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This may be one of Toronto's most consistent restaurants. I've been eating here for years and the quality and presentation of the food is always the same. So when I'm craving delicious hummus and other Middle Eastern dips, perfect fried eggplant, crispy falafel, heartwarming lentil soup and fabulously moist kabobs, this is the place to be.

The dinner for 2 ($41) is likely your best bet because it comes with pita, dips, falafel, salads, 3 kabobs, rice, pickles, etc. (Note: it does not include the lentil soup, which, at $3.95, is worth adding on). I'd say this spread is actually enough food for 3...so if you're dining as a couple, you'll likely have leftovers.

The kafta kabob, made with spiced ground lamb and beef, is outstanding; but the chicken is also done to perfection. It's hard to decide which one I like better. 

Bottom line, we're talking consistently delicious Middle Eastern grub. Last night I ate so much I was nearly in pain, but it didn't stop me from grabbing a piece of crispy baklava for dessert because...hello?? Baklava!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. Good selection and some really cool stuff like the entire lamb!

I just wish the food was a bit more flavorful. You can cover everything with hummus but a bit more spice would just make life easier."}
{"text":"Craving for shawarma? This is a great place to get it if you live in the area. The plaza has tons of parking and the restaurant has plenty of seating. I came here for take out. They have an entire different section and entrance for take out. The staff is nice. And they give large portions for the chicken shawarma dinner. It will definitely serve two people easily. You get salad, rice, meat, bunch of pickled stuff, 2 breads and sauces. 

I am a big fan of shawarma garlic sauces. This one is more dense then foamy. The taste had horse radish which gave it a bit of spicy, I could also taste sour cream and finally garlic. It was good but I prefer the foamy garlic sauces from other places. There was also no hummus included!! The rice was very plain - I love cinnamon rice which they didn't have. Overall, 4 stars for pretty good tasting meat and large portions."}
{"text":"Went with friends cuz we were in the area and heard it was good... not bad for a buffet. Not a fantastic selection but what was there was good... not overly great but still good..."}
{"text":"Bad food that not only tastes bad but also seems to be really old food that's been either out for a while or reused. Very little selection of food for a buffet and the little food that they do have is not really good at all. The live music is also terrible. It's ridiculously loud and frankly annoying for a restaurant. The price for dinner buffet is also insanely high at $25 or more for bad food and annoying music. Will not be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"This is a more family-orientated sit down middle-eastern restaurant when compared to others in the area. It has been in the area for years and has won many awards for being the best Middle Eastern food in Toronto.

The menu has many different meat options (chicken, beef, lamb, etc.) and comes mainly as kabob's. All mains appear to come with rice and salad. There were three of us who dined this evening there. Two of us got chicken skewers. They were perfectly seasoned and the meat remained moist. The rice was very tasty as well and it was clear the salad was made with fresh vegetables. The third member of our party got beef skewers and from what I could tell that was juicy and moist as well.

The one downside was the coffee which was not enjoyed by our table and from what the others could remember, they've had a similar experience with their coffee before. Dessert (vanilla and chocolate tartufo) was up to par with many other places that offer it.

All in all, atmosphere is warm and inviting. Servers are attentive and will remove the skewers from the table once is clear you are finished with them. Price point is great for the amount of food received and the quality of the food. This place is definitely worth a try as both a take out or a sit-down option."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a staple of the neighborhood for as long as I can remember. Great food, great service. If you're looking to eat there on a Saturday though either go early or make a reservation because it is packed. I usually eat the siniyeh bitaheena (my favorite dish there) but during my last visit I decided to try something different, and had the steak. No marinade or bbq sauce was used, just salt and pepper, and it was grilled to perfection and was delicious. For those with gluten sensitivity though, don't have their rice as it's mixed with a chicken soup base that had gluten. HOWEVER they will not turn you away if you bring in your own rice.  I love this place, nothing but good things to say about it.

They don't accept debit cards but there is an atm close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food at this place is not bad but also not really good. Options are limited. There are better options out there for middle eastern food or all-you-can-eat. Nothing really stands out"}
{"text":"Just noticed -- I don't know why Yelp! lists this as being in \"York.\"  It's in Toronto, just west of Bathurst.  (Come to think of it, I'm not even sure there is, or was, a city in the Toronto area called just \"York,\" but I know real estate agents are always inventing new neighborhoods to differentiate their properties, so I wouldn't be surprised ...)"}
{"text":"Spacious. Nice place for a social gathering. Halal, perfectly cooked beef, lamb, mutton. Plenty of baba ganoush, hummus, different pickles , salads to complement the meat items.  

We went for a friday night dinner buffet and it was an amazing experience. The staff was very friendly. Enquired about our food and drinks couple of times which we found really pleasing and humble. Such cordial inquiries is hard to find in a buffet place. 

I would surely recommend this place to my friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Great for self-service with wide variety of Middle East food choices. Leg of lamb was great, but a little spicy. Excellent hummus and falafel. Grilled tilapia was good, but a little dry. Special deserts like baklava."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The staff members were nice as well. I loved the bread. I disagree with another reviewer and actually respect the fact that they have the signs to prevent waste. Overall was nice."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of \"shaBANG for the buck\" buffets and good lord is Jerusalem one of them! I had a coupon too, so it made the experience even better. 

The finer details:

Ambience: Spacious, clean, not un-welcomingly foreign; the servers were friendly and the music was pleasant.

Crowd: Mixed Mississauga crowd; mostly families. I like the fact that it is neither as crowded or as loud as Paramount. 

Variety: TONS to choose from. If you're like me, experimental about cuisine, make sure you try a little of everything. I love the fact that you can walk around and try the buffet but the servers also bring you little-somethings (apart from the buffet) to try. We got pita breads, shawarma meats, the oh-so-yummy garlic dip and kebabs served this way. And then we obviously had a ton more items to choose from from the buffet. 

Verdict? Jerusalem is a meat-lovers paradise, hence mine. I am going back again for sure. 

PS: Our server was really pretty"}
{"text":"* Beware of payment scams from these guys. They have overcharged me with proof and was dealt with unpleasantly.

It's hard for me to give this restaurant any more stars than it should. Personally, I was so distraught on how I was treated that I don't recommend anybody to go in this restaurant at all.

Office gathering occurred in this restaurant. Eager to try out the restaurant and the type of food (middle eastern) in the area. Food was nothing special, maybe it's just not for me. The food was too salty and missing the flavourful food that I was expecting. The weird thing, they have images of food that was posted in their websites and restaurant that wasn't even served in the lunch package, things like shrimp and other beef stuff. Oh well, no biggie it is what it is.

The real issue is when it came time to pay. The receipt machine is not working and could not write me a written receipt. Instead they give me a sheet with the total cost without any breakdown. Anyways I was generous to agree with everything in assumption that lunch was 12 bucks per person plus drinks plus tip. The cost is about 154 including tip and paid the bill but had to come back to get a printed receipt so I can claim the bill. I later found out that the lunch menu is 9'dollars a person and the total cost didn't make senses. The total bill would've been just over hundred bucks. I was overcharged 40 bux. I spoke to manager and he agreed and called over the waiter. I spoke calmly and just wanted a proper payment and get refunded the extra no big deal mistakes happen. But these guys didn't wanna do it, and at first they just gave me 5 dollars back and confused me. Eventually they gave me 20 dollars more, threw me the money and left me standing alone.

Beware of this restaurant. If it happened to me, it might have happened to many others unknowingly. There's no need to post food pictures. Bad service can't even enjoy the food."}
{"text":"this was an alright restaurant. the food tasted good, and there were plenty of choices. i went during the buffet time, and although the food was good, i wasn't blown away. 

the service was quick and efficient. our waitress was very polite and sat us right away. there were plenty of seats, especially if you're a big group.

what i particularly enjoyed was the belly dancer that came out around 8:30pm on sunday (father's day). she must have danced for 30 minutes! she was very fun to watch, and it definitely made this restaurant stand out compared to other middle eastern restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is good only if you wanna get amused and entertained with the Music and Belly dancing! :) 

I am not a great fan of buffets because they mostly have bland, low quality food! We went here for a special occasion because we heard a lot about their shows and music. They have 2 seating times for dinner buffet: 1- 5:00-7:30 2-8:00-10:30. I reserved a table for 7:30 because the person over the phone told me they have more dancing than the first one...

The restaurant looks not very good from outside, looks like there is no light in there. No host/hostess available when we arrived! Nobody was in the front! We waited and I went inside the restaurant to find someone to have us seated. Nope! Finally after 6 minutes, a guy came over and asked us if we have reservation. I said yes and we waited another 6-7 minutes for letting them prepare the table for us and all the time there was no customer ahead of us! All were behind us! 

It was a Saturday night and restaurant was kinda full. Our table was facing the stage, so far not bad! 

The worst part was the food..... bland! First off you need to stand in a line to get a plate and the line is not very well specified and some ppl got confused as where they had to stand. My plate was wet :( yuck, I changed it with another one.

The items in buffet were not clearly labeled! Some of them were handwritten, some didn't have labels, so we had to ask the servers behind the counter what the foods are! 

Their food is flavorless, dull, cold and seemed like they reheated them over and over, looks like the foods are there all day long!!! blaaah! Never tried such a bad buffet before! I couldn't finish tasting one of them! The appetizers and salads were better! I could only have those as my dinner! The desserts part was disappointing! Most of the serving plates were empty when I wanted to get some and I had to wait for them to bring desserts!

The music which is either Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish or Farsi is good for those who are enjoying these types. The belly dancer was the best part out of all. 

We ended up paying $270, almost $30 per person, yet we did not enjoy much that we were thinking! The food and service was horrible!

Do not waste your money over bland food!"}
{"text":"Im not normally a big fan of buffets... but the food here is made with love!!
All of my Mediterranean favorites... grape leaves.. hummus.. kafta... yum.  yum and yum.

Our waitress was fun!  Older lady, dont remember her name, but she mothered us and teased us and we loved it!!

The belly dancing is also spectacular!"}
{"text":"We bought the deal on groupon for four person. The food was very bad , with a lot of oil and salty .kebab ,the most famous middle eastern food,was very dry and over salted. Even the service wasn't good, they brought a jar of water and didn't ask if we want something else to drink! 
The Worst restaurant and service I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Had a deal find coupon, drove 20 kms to get here and the place is closed Sep 11, 2014."}
{"text":"I have had the lunch buffet 3 times and they were great. Great selection with the food being fresh and tasty. Dessert section can be improved with more selections."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but the food is delicious. Nice atmosphere for birthday party. They have delicious lamb."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick dinner. We ended up having buffet. Food was ok not many choices for vegetarian. 
Service was bellow standard. Will not come here again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jerusalem since I was a kid. Their food is always fresh and very authentic tasting. I like that a lot of different cultures of people are recognizing arabic food and loving it!. I'm middle eastern myself and didn't really like that it use to be not really diverse about ten years ago but when I came here today their were so many different ethnicities enjoying the food. I ordered 2 shawarmas and 2 boxes of their daily made fresh baklava. Honestly I've been to about 15 different shawarma places and theirs is the best. I like my shawarma chicken seasoned authentically and they just know how to do it right. Their desserts are the freshest as well, very moist as how they should be not DRY!!. The staff was very friendly as well which is important too me. If your looking to try authentic middle eastern cuisine don't try other places, come here!!!!!. And if you're looking for arabic food that your mama & sitto would eat come here!!."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in the City!

The fried tomatoes are legendary, the hummus fresh on point. 

High quality, fresh middle eastern food and a very reasonable price.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Heard some good things about this place and decided to go here for a family celebration.  We went especially for the belly dancing entertainment.

As we are from out of town I made several phone calls to get information but got only limited responses. 

When I made the reservation I told the hostess that it was my wifes birthday but this was not passed on.

While the food was ok the buffet items were not labeled clearly which limited our choices.

The waitress ignored us for the evening. Didnt ask us about drinks and at the end we had to ask another waiter for our bill. All in all the staff is NOT friendly. 

Despite us making eye contact the belly dancer ignored us although she did dance at other tables. In fact went back to the same tables more than once. The show was VERY short maybe 15 - 20 minutes. She took off and we thought she was taking a break but she never came back.Remember we chose the restaurant because of the belly dancing. We had hoped to get pictures but no luck. 

All in all not the great experience we had hoped for."}
{"text":"A very good Middle Eastern restaurant. Fresh food. You can order a la carte or choose the buffet."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Great buffet for 13 bucks. I like variety when eating middle eastern food mostly because I cannot read the damn menu. I went once again on a Monday and the lunch buffet was 16 bucks. So ask if you care."}
{"text":"I came here with work colleagues and was excited to try a bunch of dishes at the lunch buffet AYCE. However, there's some dross here amongst the good stuff. I think the most enjoyable was the well-trodden path of hummus, etc. and the sesame cookies.

Complimentary breads come - pita and herby and cheesy bread. The last 2 were surprisingly bland. I grabbed a plate of eggplant, farro with beef (too salty), brussel sprouts (why were the stalks still on?) Roasted chicken in several varieties were good, but you can't go wrong with chicken. There were several fish dishes which might not look appetizing to some, but I tried 2 fish dishes and they were tasty even after being under the grill a while. The stuffed chicken dish was a bit dry and I was not sure if this was actually a regional dish. There were some dishes with cream sauces which didn;t try to save my heart. Everything seemed lukewarm may be because it was after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Reliably delicious! Call ahead as they are often busy. 
The lentil soup is a must, as are the cooked tomatoes and eggplant side dishes. The \"DINNER FOR 2\" is really for 3 or 4..

The service can be hit or miss, so we prefer to pick up big orders for family gatherings."}
{"text":"You can't expect great food from a buffet restaurant but it's descent.

The fresh pita was very good and after telling our waitress that I like it hot she kept bringing me new ones straight out of the oven. 

The belly dancer was nothing special but she did keep the audience engaged and several people danced with her.

Overall a nice place to try out,chill atmosphere, and some entertainment unlike other buffet places"}
{"text":"Food was good, but not worth the price. Meat kebabs were pretty dry but there were a lot of other options and the service was very friendly. CAUTION: groupon not valid Saturday's! Ended up paying full price but server was nice enough to use the groupon cost towards that nights dinner. ($30/person - more expensive than most ayce or buffets). Otherwise good experience, had belly dancers and music for entertainment. Would only come back here with a groupon."}
{"text":"Went here for a work event and the power went off in the neighbourhood at approximately 8pm for about an hour. Candles eventually were distributed after about 20 minutes of sitting in pitch darkness. No apologies nor announcements were provided. The food itself was not very tasty. The hummus, lentil soup, and lamb were all very mediocre. Although I have to say that their pita bread was very good and very fresh. 

The belly dancing was not very entertaining in my opinion. It might be entertaining for others, however. 

Anyway, I don't think that I would return. I was also informed by some people that they do not really change their buffet menus."}
{"text":"This buffet is really good if you time it right. As with any buffet, you're going to have the following: obnoxious little kids running around the food counter giggling. Ridiculously large parties where everyone is yelling. People picking at things. And of course, lots of waste. Its always painful to watch.

But with that said, the food here is generally quite high quality. Go during a busy time when the turnover is high and you will get great food. One of the cooks there used to work at Sababa (a favourite middle-eastern place of mine) and they have dishes there that are only really possible in a mass-consumption sort of situation: a whole stuffed lamb (really good but horribly unhealthy!), 

I would steer clear of the seafood (the preparations they have are not particularly middle-eastern - I suspect they are just filler and to have a seafood option). They also have shawarma which is pretty good, but its off the menu. You can ask your server for it and they usually have it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the ambiance had a very middle eastern feeling. The staff was attentive, but the decor was outdated and the walls had peeling paint/stains. It could use some updating and a good clean. We had the buffet @ 24.00/pp which I felt was a little pricey, but it was good food, so we felt it was ok to pay that. They just need to add some descriptions on the food because we did not know what some of the food was."}
{"text":"Came here for a Christmas party and I thought it was great. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice. The only complaint I have is the size of the restaurant. I found that the buffet was too small for the amount of people that the restaurant holds. The line up to get to the buffet spanned from one end of the restaurant to the other. But what I loved the most was the live entertainment. They band and singer were really good. The belly dancer was fantastic. Both entertainers went around to all the tables and engaged the whole restaurant. Making sure that everyone enjoyed themselves and even got people to dance. Myself included. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb skewer combo + minced lamb/beef skewers. The lamb skewer was tender and delicious. The minced lamb and beef skewer on the other hand was okay tasting but definitely dry so I didn't like it.

We got the falafel plate as an appetizer which was decent. It had a crisp outer shell and I like the taheena sauce."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area of Bayview Village, Yelp has been invaluable tool helping us explore local establishments. The mostly positive reviews of Jerusalem had us excited about a planned take out dinner for visiting guests. In short, the food was horrible! The meat was so bad that I could not eat any of it and the rest of the food was an oily mess of salt and fat. I can only think that the positive reviews were in reference to the ability to over eat at the buffet. I did not eat anything the next day as I felt dirty from the inside out. One of the worst meals since moving to the area. I should have known better to trust the reviews of an AYCE buffet.

If you don't care what you eat so long as it's a lot and relatively inexpensive...then knock yourself out. If you like good food, then pass on Jerusalem ."}
{"text":"The food here tasted decent. However, there were so many flies flying around and one actually landed on my plate and died in the food grease so I'm giving this place 3 stars. As for the actual food, I felt like there was a lot of Italian food like pasta, pizza and lasagna. I suppose there's a lot of crossover between countries. However, I was hoping to try some food that I've never had before. As for the service, the staff here was very nice and efficient. If you do come here, I would suggest trying their dessert that looks like flan."}
{"text":"With all the random havoc going down in the middle east nowadays, the moniker Jerusalem could perhaps inspire some unsettledness in the tummies of the restaurant's potential clientele before they even arrive at the venue.  But I have a word of advice: let not the thousands of years of biblical violence stop you from entering this peaceful restaurant.  I swear, sometimes I am so geared up to go to Jerusalem that I could part the red sea just to get there.

But you don't have to be Moses to enjoy Jerusalem, you just have to like garlic.   All the dishes are teeming with this aromatic bulb of the Gods so you can't avoid it.  The have-to-try dishes are the Lentil soup, chicken shishtawoo, falafel balls, and all the Mediterranean dips.  Go with a big group so you can give everything at least one try."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Decent prices, but the food quality could be better.
Enjoyed the bellydancing & the service was polite. 

The place itself is a little run down & could use improvements.
More meat dishes would be great (didn't have enough variety).
Food needs more flavour, I found it quite bland.

2 stars because the service was great, but food not so much.

Would not return."}
{"text":"Land of milk and honey. And hummus, baba g, sundried tomatoes, tahini, falafel, tipapia, beet salad, kofte, calamari, buttery bean salad, garlic shrimp, and rice pudding. 

The best $20 I've spent in a long time, and by far the best buffet I've visited in my life. Instead of feeling lethargic after 3 plates of colorful foods, I felt amazing!

Although there were plenty of meaty options (such as rice with lamb and grilled chicken) there were a bounty of dishes fit for a vegatarian-- or a gluten-free-- feast!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been there for many years. Food good, freshly made,  and reasonably priced, with good sized helpings. Great fallafel...Decor a bit old and dark and could do with a remake. I have patronized the place many times. Unfortunately the wait staff seem to be getting more surly each time.....pity...as it makes for a less than pleasant experience....."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for dinner.  The place was packed.  This increased our expectations.  The food was overall awful.  We ordered the chicken kabob and the mixed grill kabob. The food came with salad and lentil soup. The lentil soup was the best part of the meal.  I thought the soup was quite good.  The kabobs were horrible.  Flavorless and Bland.  It did not seem fresh or even grilled.  They also put some vegetables on a stick on the plate.  The vegetables  were not cooked.  Why not put the vegetables on the grill at least.  The bread was not made fresh.  It is pretty much the same pita bread that you get at your local grocery store. The kabobs seems like they were fried or something.  It was just overall a bad restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"I found this restaurants buffet menu really limited for the price.  And the cuts of meat were not seasoned and really dry.

The sides are also really limited.

And if you are going and intend to have a conversation, forget it.... Extremely loud."}
{"text":"Went for Friday night dinner.  It was pretty OK actually.  I was impressed by the lamb, which was served at the carving station and told it's only available Friday and Saturday nights.  The belly dancer came out at 8pm and put on a little show, but the (live) music gets SUPER loud so if you want some enjoyable conversation at a decent decibel level, I would recommend going around 6pm.  

The rest of the food was nothing special. A couple of things were over-salted in our opinions, but to their credit everything was actually pretty fresh and refilled often.  Also, there are a lot of vegetarian options which is great if you have any herbivores in your group.

OH! And if you check in on Yelp, then you get a free pop!  DO IT!"}
{"text":"Not recommended.

Food was actually not too bad for a buffet - if you don't mind barely warm plates with the dishes burning your hands. Drinks menu was rather simplistic and brief. The place was packed Saturday evening, service and the crowd were authentic.

What was killing it all was the \"music\". That dude torturing a Hammond was discovering the basics of harmony and rhythm for a very first time - and it was loud, intrusive and horrible. Sort of like a kid playing with dad's cellphone, making some weird squeaking noises, mixed with automated \"orientalish\" tremolo.

At first we laughed, but when one of the guests took his place and for about ten minutes was showing the public that Middle Eastern music is actually not just a horrific noise - and the bum-box boss was standing next to him with a face of a baby who got his caramel stolen - the whole scene started to look completely miserable.

Belly dancer was there, by the way. Comfortably doing her routine, positively accepted by the public. It would be a silly overestimation, though, to consider that a show. Not even a one-person show.

And then came a bill. 100$+ for two.

So they actually call that place a \"restaurant\" for a reason."}
{"text":"No falafels!! What ?!? 

We came here for a family dinner (8 of us) on a cold Thursday evening. I was really looking forward to trying out a middle eastern buffet style restaurant. I was told to try their falafels (I looooove falafels btw) and was really looking forward to them. 

When we arrived, we were quickly seated at our table. The restaurant is quite large, especially the dining area compared to the food section. Once we seated, the waiter handed us a basket of naan bread, flat bread and garlic bread. They were nice and warm. 

Now for the food, to be honest, there weren't a lot of selections. My first consisted of grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini, grilled sun dried tomato, red beets, purple radish, a little bit of corn salad, a spoonful of tabooleh, and a mini slice of spinach pizza. Oh and also, a plate of three types of hummus for dipping the bread. Overall, I was content with my first plate. Although my food was somewhat cold (all the grilled veggies and pizza), I still enjoyed it. 

My second plate, I was told to try the grilled cauliflower, which at first I thought were deep fried chicken, so I got a few of try, some steamed broccoli, yellow rice, a yellow vegetable stuffed with rice and red tomato sauce, and then I remembered, where are the falafels ?!? I couldn't find them at all. My second plate was just alright, I was starting to run out of things to try, again not a lot of options. Again, I was pretty disappointed that they didn't serve falafels, ugh! 

There was a hot food section, which served, roasted potatoes, grilled fish, deep fried fish, lamb, chicken skewers with grilled veggies, lasagna, rice dish, etc. 

My third plate, I went straight for the dessert section- I got some jumbo strawberries, melon, Turkish delight, rice pudding and another hot pudding with the most sweetest aroma ever(there weren't much left in the pot, I'm guessing it was a popular item). There were a few other fruits/desserts that I didn't grab, like the carrot cake, flan, baklava, slices of oranges, etc. 

At 8:30ish our came the belly dancer, I wasn't too amused. She danced for a while, but I just kept thinking about my falafels...

Overall, I was pretty bummed out there were no falafels. Enough about the falafels. The end."}
{"text":"You know I was pleasantly surprised when I ended up here with some colleagues for lunch. 

The value in jerusalem is this happy medium between quantity of options and taste. 

It's got a lot of mediterenean options like egg plant; lentil soup; fatouch salads; all kinds of hummus and babaganoush variations, Turkish pizzas etc. You've also got some really hearty options like lamb keftas, fish, chicken, a roast beef carvery; etc. The appetizer section is great. The main sort of section falls a little short as it gets blended in with some north American dishes. Sadly the desserts are just poor. 

But over all @ $11.99 for lunch I was pleasantly surprised and will go back if its another work thing. 

P.s I've been to Jerusalem over 10 years ago last and its really improved in quality since then."}
{"text":"Just went to this restaurant and I really liked the atmosphere at this place. It's a buffet style restaurant with middle eastern food all the food I tried was really good. You just have to pay extra for your drinks but the service here was amazing. They also have entertainment I think it might only be on weekends  however. I went on a Saturday night and they had belly dancer perform around the room while everyone is eating. I would say it's perfect even for a family setting. There were a lot of families there that evening too. I highly recommend this place if your looking for a new and different kind of buffet."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the Navroze celebrations. Had to reserve a place here since the main Leslie location was fully booked so this was our first time here. 

The service was absolutely amazing considering how crowded the restaurant was. The food, while there was just as much variety as the Leslie location,was lacking in taste. The cooks need to learn not to be so heavy handed with the salt in the meat dishes. The vegetables were delicious. The desserts were numerous, but none of them were made well. I ended up eating the fruit ,and even some of that was acidic."}
{"text":"If you want Mediterranean buffet, this is the place.

Food is well prepared with a variety of dishes.
They have special dishes for holidays, the seasoning tends to be on the salty side.

There's middle eastern music and belly dancing at dinner times which makes for a good entertainment.

This place is good. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Food was overall bland, though the lamb was tender and succulent.  Buffet area was tight and enclosed.  Belly dancer seemed to be \"going through the motions\", but all and all pleasant atmosphere with a plethora of cultures, that make me love Toronto even more."}
{"text":"I went here once before it turned into a buffet, it was overpriced as all hell and the food was pretty good. I went again when it turned to buffet, nothing there wowed me, it was all on par but pretty cheap. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant . Go if you are on a budget and looking for a middle eastern feel!"}
{"text":"wide selection of food. lamb was my fav. very family oriented restaurant, good for big parties"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch... friendly service.  Good variety for a buffet style.

Lot's of greens and meats."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff, nice layout, decor is nice,  food was good, i was a little disappointed with the dessert selection."}
{"text":"Great food served in a fun and exciting atmosphere.  I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Buffet lunch. Went with two friends.  Choices were amazing and delicious. As a vegetarian, I had so much to eat and all was so tasteful.  My two friends enjoyed the meat choices as well. The falafel was the best I have had.  Whole wheat bread with the meal was perfect.  Large choice of salads, hummus, tahini, warm and cold vegetable dishes. Even the dessert choices were excellent.
Great value for the money.  Enjoyed thoroughly!"}
{"text":"Some of the reviews on here are just crazy! C'mon people! Some of you are describing how delicious everything is and giving them THREE Stars, lol morons. We had a company dinner here last night. I'm giving this place a FIVE because in my opinion, it's the best tasting buffet in the entire Toronto area. (We drove from Mississauga) The food quality is top notch. The variety is jaw dropping. Its impossible to try everything! Everything is so tasty. The staff is efficient, genuinely nice and friendly. Our empty plates were always cleared before we returned with another round of food.  A side note: the live music and belly dancing seem to be on for only around 30 minutes a day. We caught the show from 8-8:30pm on Thursday. The show is worth checking out so, confirm the timings.

I will return with my family as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"The food here is healthy and freshly made. They keep it coming all night.

However I dont find the flavours particularly exciting. The potatoes and chicken kebabs were dry and the beef ones were undercooked.

The nice thing is when I told the staff about the improperly cooked food they werent defensive. They wanted to know exactly which foods needed improvement and they told the chef what was wrong right away and asked them to correct it.

Nice staff. I recommend it if you like middle eastern food. 

But the desserts are limited and are lame."}
{"text":"Dear Jerusalem Restaurant.

I love your falafel more than any other in the CLT... but there are a few things missing/going awry that, if fixed, would rocket you to a 5 star rating.

First, let me just say that your falafel, in itself, is outstanding. Perfectly fried to a crisp outer shell, yet moist, herby, and soft steaminess await my bite inside. They are the Perfect Size. Don't change a thing.

However... I need more veggies in my sammich. I realize you are a roll-up falafel joint, and I am coming to accept that that is the only style of falafel I will eat in Charlotte. But please, please, more tomatoes, and lettuce, and pickles, will round that mother out. Nothing makes me happier than hot, steamy, fried falafel perfectly complimented by crisp, cold tomato, and the bite of a piece of onion. Or cabbage. Red cabbage. 

And really, must the ubiquitous Huy Fong cock sauce make an appearance even here? Its a pho condiment. Its my favorite hot sauce in the world, but there are places it does not belong (rolled up in pita with fried chickpea balls and pickles, being one of them). Oily, high-heat, toasted chili sauce or super-potent chili paste is what I crave. 

Your hummus wasn't amazing, but was pleasing, and beautifully presented. The grape leaves were VERY good, swimming in an olive oil pool garnished with finely minced pickled lemon and (possibly) oregano. I'm making myself hungry, typing about them.

I will soon be back to try your Ganoush."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. The food was fresh and there was so much variety. Lunch used to be for $10. Lunch now is $13 and they took away so many favorites (like the tabouleh and the stuffed grape leaf). Not just that, they put left overs from last night's buffet. The quality has been going down the hill, and the prices have been going up.

Overpriced on weekday dinners and weekends."}
{"text":"My family goes here occasionally for their shawarma take out. Super yummy! The meat is not skimped out on, the pocket is full of the toppings you choose, and it's reasonably priced. The servers are generally quite nice too.

Only reason it's not 5/5 is the price, compared to other shawarma places I've been to."}
{"text":"My boyfriend raved about Jerusalem for quite some time. He kept telling me that we needed to go at least once, so we finally went to the Eglinton West location. Jerusalem is a family oriented restaurant that specializes in Middle Eastern food. The last time I went to a Middle Eastern restaurant was a year ago to Paramount by Yonge and Dundas and the food was incredibly dry. I was not impressed and I avoided going to Middle Eastern restaurants up until now.

We ordered the Jerusalem Kebab Supreme, which was a large portion for two people. It came with yellow rice, salad, and lamb. Unlike the experience I had at Paramount, the lamb was delicious and tender. I enjoyed the meal and we were both full by the end of it. The meal was definitely a good deal for two people. I definitely recommend Jerusalem if you love Middle Eastern food and would like to take your family out for dinner."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet, a lot of food. It's was very fresh. Come hungry. Lentil soup is superb. All meats are very yummy! Plenty of salads & veggies for vegetarians. Dessert table is dangerous....too good, especially the carrot cake! 
Great for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Middle Eastern Food!!  Been coming here since they opened this location.  Recently had them cater a birthday party for us and was beyond our expectations.  The meat was very juicy, flavorful and tender, the Falafel were crispy and salad was crisp and fresh.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to eat authentic middle eastern food.  Their take out menu is great as we grab that sometimes for lunch for us at the office since we dont typically have enough time to do the buffet.  The shawarmas are out of this world, the size of them you cannot compare to any other place that makes them.  Over all great food, great exprience, and price is good.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of all you can eat, buffet style restaurants, but Jerusalem wasn't too bad. The food is Middle Eastern, and the vibe... very middle eastern. What I like about this place was that it wasn't your typical buffet restaurant, where it wasn't just about eating and getting out. Jerusalem Restaurant offers live entertainment, at dinner time, complete with Arabic pop songs and belly dancers. What takes the cake though was the overall liveliness of the place, and not with just the entertainment, but with the clientèle! During the music and entertainment portion of the evening, people were getting up to dance, clap, and sing along with the band. Personally I felt this made my dining experience coupled with the super friendly wait staff and servers. 

Fair warning though, if you're there on a heavy birthday night, be prepared to have the same happy birthday sung over and over again. The entertainer could have spaced out the birthdays I think, instead of opting of going through the whole list and going from table to table singing the same song. 

I won't comment much on the food. It's laid out in typical buffet fashion. It wasn't bad, but nothing stood out either aside from the khabsa (rice cooked in roast lamb) which brought memories back to when I lived in the Arabian Gulf. 

I would go back to this place, but more for the experience and the good times than the food."}
{"text":"This place is reliable.  It's been operating for years.  The food is not as interesting as at Tabülè, but it's still tasty.

The meat skewers are moist and are perfectly cooked.  The highlights for me are: labneh  (strained yogurt), kubbe (like a corn dog, but with spiced ground meat), siniyeh (kebab covered with tahini), lentil soup (it is fantastic, and is served with a slice of lemon for tang) and the rice (they make tasty yellow rice.)

They also have very reasonably priced lunches which include a bowl of lentil soup.

One small complaint is that the portions are not huge, but they are fair.  One word of caution: this place can get very busy, especially on a Friday night.  Even when you get take out, expect a line up at the pickup."}
{"text":"This is a first for me - a buffet that's not Chinese. Crazy right?

I found this place out from the wife, who was curious to try this restaurant out for the past two weeks. It's a bit off the beaten path for us, but with an open schedule, we figured we'd try it out. We went on a weekend for their lunch buffet.... with only 30 minutes left....

The front desk service was mediocre - we waited a couple minutes before being asked how many people would be dining. Our waitress, on the other hand, was wonderful and had a great sense of humour!

Now, on the to the food. Their buffet area is pretty small - about maybe half the size compared to Mandarin, but then again comparing the two is like comparing David to Goliath. Despite the size, their food options are quite good. They've got an appetizer/salad island in the middle, several vegetarian dishes and main dishes around the sides, and a small dessert station. You'll often find yourself grabbing the same things after round 2 or 3.

If they have some available, I recommend their falafels!

Jerusalem Restaurant is a good choice if you're looking for a different buffet cuisine, and depending on when you go (ideally weekdays for lunch, if not weekend lunch), you can't go wrong with the price."}
{"text":"bankrupted! bad food, bad service - hope the new place is good!"}
{"text":"I was here with family last week. The place is very cozy and you hear a lot of people speaking Hebrew at the next table. I'm a big Middle Eastern cuisine fan and this place has a special place in my heart. I've come here twice before, mostly with family cause they also like Middle Eastern food. The shish tawook and chicken breast are my favourites. I honestly couldn't tell much difference between the two though. The mezza plate (not sure of the spelling) is an excellent dish to share. There's a little bit of everything: Falafels, olives, beet, hummus, baba ghanouj, etc. The price is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"***2.5 stars***

My best friend has been going here with her mother since we were kids and I've had some pretty high expectations with regards to the food.

- There were never staff at the meat stations
- Some of the food trays are grouped on top of each other making it hard to serve yourself
-There are barely any signs indicating what you are plopping to your plate
- The pita bread was cold, hard and stale

Overall I'd say the food was decent but definitely not worth the $33 price tag for dinner. Lunch looks like a better deal."}
{"text":"Good food, always freshly prepared.
It's an open buffet style, so it's essential to have everything fresh and warm at all times. It's been open for so many years so it's a great established business.

Depends om the time of the day, it can be busy at times especially on weekends/evenings.
They usually have a singer or two and belly dancing shows, which is a nice add-on to a typical traditional middle-eastern restaurant, without pushing the knob onto a club/lounge type of business.

The restaurant is licensed, so serving alcohol is also a good add-on to the whole scene.

My best favourite items are their grilled meats and chicken and salad bar.

Nothing wrong about a good old hummus and fattoush!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation from a co-worker I checked this place out. She was right about the food. The prices are reasonable and it was delicious. 4-stars for sure.

What isn't so good is the ambiance and the service. The restaurant is in serious need of an update. The old furniture needs to go, or be redone. It took forever for the server to come by my table to ask if I wanted a drink as I waited for the rest of my party to arrive. When I finally did get the glass of wine I ordered, the glass had lipstick on it.

They don't take debit here. Lame."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, while I did find some of the items to be somewhat bland.. it's healthy and it's good. I really like the rice and the beef. I definitely would go back. The customer service was decent."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give a lower score I'd give it.  So this restaurant offers a buffet of Mediterranean flavors which on the surface looks good for the value.  All you need to know is we saw a waiter clearing the table beside us put food back onto the buffet from a plate a customer had eaten off of already after they left!!!!  Disgusting!!!!! Mortified we left"}
{"text":"Good food. I would recommend showing up earlier or booking a reservation since it gets busy pretty quickly"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing Jerusalem Restaurant, on Eglinton and Bathurst.

I'm surprised to see that this restaurant has such a low rating. After reading the reviews, it doesn't even seem like the same restaurant!  This is probably the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Toronto. The food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the service is impeccable! I've gone to Jerusalem countless times, and I've never had a bad meal. The place is always busy, so there must be a reason it is still around.

Whenever I go to Jerusalem, I get the dinner for two for $36. The dinner combo includes: hummus, baba ganouch,  4 falafels, bread, a side of vegetables, salad, rice, your choice of either baked tomatoes or baked eggplant, and lastly, your choice of  any three kabobs (meatball, liver, chicken and beef are the options). There is no way two people can eat that much food. The portions are generous, and for less than $50, glass of wine included, you can have a great meal!

I strongly recommend the baked tomatoes. I don't even like tomatoes, and I devour these every time. Their hummus is also very good. The meat can be a little bit dry, but it is something you have to expect from Middle Eastern cooking.  I'd avoid the meatball kabob as it is usually the driest. The rice is heavenly! It is always so moist and fresh. I would go as far as calling it the best rice in the city. I cannot get enough of it.

Jerusalem is very nicely decorated, it can be quite romantic if you manage to secure a good spot (by the bay windows). Avoid an early supper if you are looking to have a romantic dinner. Jerusalem is a family restaurant, so don't be surprised to see a bunch young couples with their kids, and on occasion, a few crying babies!

Reservations are recommended, but not required. Last time I was there, they didn't take debit, so make sure you have cash or a credit card. If you are craving Middle Eastern, give this restaurant a try. It is really worth it."}
{"text":"I typically do not enjoy buffets or all you can eat. My family however, advocates for it. As a result, we often frequent buffets. Jerusalem has a nice ambiance with a great variety.

Overall, the service was great and attentive. The dessert was the most disappointing part of the buffet. I echo another reviewer on the dry cake and excessive use of gelatin. Meat dishes were slightly bland. My family raved about the roasted lamb (after their own addition of salt, black pepper and lemon juice) . Manakish Za'atar, fresh pita and grilled zucchini were amongst my favorite. 

If you love lamb, visit on Sunday at around 1:00 pm for moist roasted lamb shoulders and 2:00-2:30 pm for whole roasted lamb."}
{"text":"I've tried Jerusalem's take out as well as dine in. The food is fresh and consistently excellent. Lots of options for veggie or meat lovers. They even have fish / sea food options. Their falafel, eggplant and baba ghanoush are to die for. I also tried the shrimp entree today (not the BBQ) and it was A-mazing! Their portions are a great size. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food in the GTA - my boyfriend (who is Palestinian) says this food reminds him so much of his childhood and what he's used to eating at home. The only complaint I have with this restaurant is the service - I found that some servers have been a little rude in the past, but other than that, it's a phenomenal place. I'd recommend getting a couple of different things to share, as you want to try as much food as possible here!"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite buffets cus you can eat all the hummus, babaganoush, and tabouleh salad in the world.  They have great selections and the staff is super nice.

One cool thing they had was rice with angel hair pasta.  Who knew such a combo existed and it is quite tasty.

Lots of veggie dishes which I love as well."}
{"text":"Fun to visit. I enjoy seeing some entertainment while enjoying the food there. Not sure about the culture. We were all women sitting in one table and the dancers didn't come to our table in particular. Feeling unfairly treated. Hope they can improve this. We are all here for the dancers !"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Always a pleasure to eat here. The dinner for two is highly recommended and hits all aspects of the cuisine. Fried eggplant is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous of times for their lunch buffet on weekdays. I have yet to tried their dinner.
My review is based on lunch buffet and I'm compared the quality of their food with other buffet places.

My coworkers and I enjoyed our visits here; good selections to satisfy different people. Food gets replenished fast and good service. They cleaned up our dirty plates quickly and refilled our water on a timely manner.
You can also get shawerma sandwiches to go if you don't have time to sit in 
Will return if I happen to be in the area"}
{"text":"As vegetarians we are always on the lookout for good places to eat that cater to vegetarians. 

Both of us love Middle Eastern food and since I have lived in Dubai, I know what good ME food tastes like. 

Jerusalem is right up there among good ME restaurants. We tried some very good hummous, fresh tabbouleh and baba ganoush   

The portions were adequate for two people.

We did go on a Thu so the service was good, although the place was half full."}
{"text":"Below average, bland tasting spread at our dinner visit. I visited Jerusalem after perhaps 6 or 7 years and got reminded, of why not to come back.

Loud music, so loud that we could not converse.
Bland tasting food
Average service
$29.95 person buffet dinner! (pricey) for the quality 

Probably won't be back for many years again."}
{"text":"The interior is a bit gaudy and intimidatingly huge and it is constantly packed but the food is really exceptional.  I am not a buffet fan as generally the quality suffers badly to offset the volume.  That's not the case here.  I love middle eastern and they do it very well.  Its a bit pricey but given that they maintain quality - I think fair.  If you have a massive appetite and like this kind of food, I don't see how you can be disappointed.  Unless you are looking for ambiance but then again, you likely would have known this wasn't the spot from its location in a strip plaza in any event."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant tucked away in Nymark Plaza! They have a small lunch buffet with little variety (it's literally just a small room), but the flavors are amazing. Servers are really helpful and they have live dancing sometimes."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service.  However the food was totally not our style.  It may be that we don't enjoy the type of food offered...  we didn't like the smell of some of the food, could be the sauce... we ended up eating some salad, cheese pizza things and bread."}
