{"text":"I ordered the Julienne salad and loved it. They assemble their salads themselves, so I wasn't stuck with carrots, onions, or tomatoes. The chicken and steak were very good, too, and I enjoyed their creamy garlic dressing."}
{"text":"Generous portions,  tasty food.  A pleasant neighborhood ambiance. Service ranges from Ok to  Great.   A Pickering institution for at least 30 years."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood Restaurant for me. The food is good. The patio tries hard in the summer."}
{"text":"Without a question... This is one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA.  And I have been to a lot of restaurant's in my years.  My wife and I have celebrated several milestone's at Massey's including our wedding rehearsal dinner, several Valentine's dinner's, and countless other date nights.  The food is always excellent, excellent value for the money, not overly expensive either.  I give it 5 stars without a doubt.  You have to try one of their milkshakes!!  Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch. We both had the cheeseburgers and fries.  The food was served hot and plentiful.  This used to be one of my hangouts back in the 90s and i moved away. It was nice to come back to the place after so many years and still have that same dining experience."}
{"text":"its great. Food is good, servers are nice... I have had a lot of the menu and am a regular."}
{"text":"Good average quality nothing amazing or exciting but a good variety on the menu when you're bringing the crowd decent portions friendly staff served properly served hot can't say anything bad about the place"}
{"text":"Excellent location, definitely try the peanut butter banana burger!!"}
{"text":"I would like to say I've been to Massey's dozens of times and the food and service have usually been good. The last time however has changed my view of the restaurant completely. First of all I was told that I couldn't change what I got on my burger which I've done many times before. (No tomatoes or Olives but extra feta and Tzatziki) I was told that they had a staff meeting and that was no longer allowed. I was also told after I was asked if I wanted a refill that there are no longer free refills. This was after I had already drank a second glass. I mean who offers someone a refill and then afterwards tells you that they aren't free. It felt like entrapment, not sure what management is thinking in changing all these rules but it will definitely affect my decision on eating there again."}
{"text":"We came here with some friends, was told they were famous for their burgers and the Caesar salad...I ordered a French onion soup followed by a bread less burger, done medium. The soup came in a very deep bowl with cheddar cheese...I'm used to seeing anything but cheddar, didn't leave me with a particularly good impression...bread had absolutely no body, close to being mushy.  I left half the soup and moved on to my main. The dressing for my Greek salad was a touch on the thick side, but then again, I prefer to lightly dip my fork in the dressing before getting some salad, so worked well for me, good flavour.  I also enjoyed the flavour of the bruschetta on top of the burger.  Though the inside was cooked to medium as per my request, the outside was a touch overdone and hard.  The rice was ok...food was average and although our server was nice, she disappeared for a long while between dropping off our bill and collecting our payment.  The restaurant was not particularly that busy, so I was curious as to why we didn't see much of her. I am not rushing back there anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great prices. My family and I have been going to Massey's for a few years and they have become the family favourite. The food and service is consistently great! The steak sandwich is to die for."}
{"text":"The food is average. Nothing special. I don't think we would go back again. Use to be a lot better years ago."}
{"text":"I've come here with my family for at least 15 years. I truly believe it changed from good to better. The food was unbelievable. I had the chicken kebobs and the creamy garlic salad dressing was outstanding. The kebobs tasted like they were done on the BBQ out back (smoky flavor). The waitress was SO sweet, and \"with it\". Then again, I don't judge my dining experience too much on if they make little mistakes, but more if they treat you like a human being. This was my husband's first time, and he agreed he wants to come back. The best part is, although the food is great, it's got a homey feel to it - so show up in your jeans and t-shirt because you're allowed to be comfortable and casual here."}
{"text":"Staleak on a Kaiser, and fries with gravy, with a big slice of coco chocolate cake for dessert. These are the only things I've ever ordered at Massey's, and the only things I ever will, because they just hit the spot.  The steak is not your typical thin steak with a string of fat and gristle round the outside, its several layers of lean, very tender, marinated flank steak grilled over real charcoal and piled high on a fresh Kaiser. I always ask for sliced pickles, onions, and tomato on mine, to which I add some HP sauce. The fries are fresh cut and the gravy is old school, greasy spoon, take out joint delicious. The chocolate cake is made in house from scratch, and it's good enough to have inspired a spin-off bakery shop selling cakes and cupcakes next door. Don't be fooled by the disgruntled family member across the road, Massey's is the original Big M, and I've been going here since I was a kid."}
{"text":"Friends of ours recommended Massey's for a Sunday afternoon late lunch. The four of us arrived and were quickly seated. The location is clean and interesting. We easc order different items. The food arrived in a reasonable time. The portion size was large and the quality of the food was excellent.   The server was dressed in an appropriate uniform. She was friendly and professional.  The price was more than reasonable. I would be happy to return and recommend it for a family, or a couple. I will be going there again."}
{"text":"This place is a local institution in Pickering.  Still family owned I believe, staff are super friendly, food is solid, and we never worry about taking our 2 year old and 2 month old there for dinner.  Very family friendly.  Good portion sizes.  They also own the cupcake shop that is now attached, and we always seem to get 4 cupcakes to go on our way out.    Menu items we love 1) Steak Sandwich - it's been on their menu forever.  Get it cooked medium (gets a bit tough if it's done any less), I get fried onions and mushrooms on it (just ask), and I also like to have some BBQ sauce on the steak when it's cooked.   2) Chicken Kebabs - I get it with the greek twist, that comes with the greek salad, rice and two good sized skewers of chicken.  I also like it because I can eat it with one hand as I hold the baby in the other hand :) 3) Side Salad - Ok the salad is just a standard side salad with tomatoes, cuc's, some shredded carrot...but I LOVE the creamy garlic dressing.  If it weren't so thick I would drink it. 4) Mac and Cheese - My wife loves it 5) Their soups - all of them are great, my wife craves the split pea soup on Fridays though...I think that's what it is. 6) Milkshake - Although she has an aversion to dairy, my wife can't resist the massive chocolate milkshake when she goes.  We don't venture too far off those menu items unless there is a daily special that looks interesting, but perhaps in 2014 I'll expand and try some other items.  It's not a huge menu but a good selection...something for everyone.  I'm not in love with the fries, my wife likes them but they aren't exciting to me.  The burgers...maybe they have to much seasoning in them for me, I like a more pure burger patty (just beef) with just some light seasoning on the outside before cooking.  The pulled pork I don't love, it's just ok.  Onion rings are good, garlic bread is good (what you expect to have), and they do have daily specials.  Fish and chips looks good but I've never had it because of my lack of love for the chips :)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with some friends, not a bad little place.  Food is decent and the price is right, and you wont leave hungry.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.  The place is a bit dated but still not a bad place to sit with some friends and share a meal."}
{"text":"When I went to the washroom there after going to the waterfront I figured I would buy ice cream there for a treat well when I was going to do that this guy that works there said that's too small of money basically saying if your not rich your a piece of crap so I thought rude customer service I give this place 0 stars for demanding the amount of money screw them there are much better places that will treat you with respect I refuse to spend money where you get treated disrespectfully and have a demanding sitdown price instead of being so demanding here's a little tip to take be respectful and nicer because the way I got treated today was not nice I got treated like I was a criminal if I don't spend $8 which is really rude and very poor customer service. The girl was nice for letting Me use the washroom but man that guy there that works there does not know customer service. The place doesn't deserve a 1 star even that's how crap it was but I did that because I want to do a post to make a complaint. I called to make a complaint and man the guy is rude he cuts you off and hangs up on you. You do not do that to someone that was about buy an ice cream to help you out and you do not demand a sitdown price that is crap service I was about to get an ice cream and got denied and got looked at like I was some criminal. I gave them a couple chances in my call but after being rude and hanging I can truthfully say fuck Massey's no customer service can't say I enjoy a place that is rude I am done with Massey's."}
{"text":"My wife suggested that we check out one of her old haunts.  I checked Yelp! to ensure the place was open  My first impression was that you get a sense of a warm atmosphere and that people are laid back to enjoy there meal and not be rushed.    We started off with some onion rings as an appie.  Very good, thick cut with a nice dip.  I might have suggested a thinner dip as the onion rings got mangled when you dip them.   My wife ordered the steak special with baked potato and side Caesar salad.  She loved it all.  Steak prepared the way she wanted it medium rare.    I had the steak in a kaiser with side Caesar salad.  Personally I like a bit more garlic and some bacon but my meal was good too.   The evening was capped with a shared slice of coconut cream pie.  You could tell the pastry shell was homemade and the cream topping was real cream.  Very good.   The only pet peeve was the slight lack of attention.  We got a lot of service at the front and back end of the meal but when we needed extra napkins or a refill of our drinks we did not see our server.    A good meal with the wife."}
{"text":"I definitely don't mind the occasional visit  A nice family restaurant  Usually have the chicken wrap there  Their pasta isn't bad either  I have also had the burgers there and they are quite yummy  Would definitely suggest this place for whenever you need some comfort food"}
{"text":"I know this is a sacred Pickering landmark and here is the but. It is ok.  Not great but ok.  The hamburgers are huge and overall the quantity of food is there for you.  But it was bland.  The wings that we were told were hot but not suicide hot actually burned the taste buds off my tongue!   Not only tasteless and spicy but burn you like no other. The fries were typical fair and overall I would say it is an ok place to eat at but not a night out that I would seek."}
{"text":"Anyone that says their food was good doesn't know what good food is.  This is THE most over rated restaurant in Pickering.  Borderline tolerable food, terrible service, outdated decor.  1 visit in 25 years is plenty."}
{"text":"Their burgers are okay, but everything else I've had has been so-so. The caesar salad ususally comes with far too much dressing. Service is okay, but I've had good and bad experiences each time I've gone."}
{"text":"Massey's is like a Pickering institution. When I first started working in Pickering, I was invited to a retirement dinner party there. When I asked \"What's Massey's?\" people gave me that look. You know, the one which suggests you might have two heads? It seemed inconceivable to them that I didn't know what it was. And I understand why.   Massey's has been around since the 1960s toward the bottom of Liverpool Road, and it's longevity is understandable. The food is excellent, served by friendly and attentive servers. Their soups are incredible (and I'm pretty sure home-made), there's always two on, and usually about six specials.   One gets the impression that steak on a kaiser is what got them really famous, and it's definitely not to be missed. The steak is tender, juicy, and cooked to order, piled on the bun with a myriad of condiment options alongside. I like that all the sides are \"extras\" - if you want fries, a salad, whatever - it's not included - so you aren't paying for them if you don't want them. Their Caesar salad, incidentally, is excellent, but bring a toothbrush along or lots of mints, it's full of garlic!   For simple, good food and a nice atmosphere, it's a great stop."}
{"text":"Oh we'll be coming back says my wife, who by the way is a ovo-lacto-pescatarian...so you non-meat eaters have no problem here. Vegans beware. Vegetarians take care. This is big meat and fish. Very nautical in theme...love the giant swordfish on the wall. I posted pics of the food, need say no more...traditional American fare....fresh and yummy. A bit crowded for my liking...and quite noisy. This is definately a family restaurant...good luck wining and dining your lady love here...better for people watching. There is a patio but it was closed...two waitresses had different explanations why. Read the other reviews. They describe the food. If you want a decent meal and then to go for a walk along the boardwalk at Fishermans Bay, this is the spot. The snooty bar down by the water has the prices and the view, but for me, I'll take Masseys, the free parking, and then head down to the water."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Massey's many times over the last 25+ years and I've always felt like it's a nice family oriented neighbourhood restaurant. I haven't been here much in the last five years or so because there are so many other choices now but today's visit brought back that feeling. Most of the guests were either families with young kids or seniors. I suspect some of them may even have walked to the restaurant from nearby homes.  I ordered a Club Sandwich with a Caesar Salad and it was pretty good. There was certainly an adequate amount of chicken and bacon, lettuce, and some perfectly ripened tomatoes. The pickle on the side was very good. I should have asked what brand it was. The Caesar salad was as good as I remember, with a creamy house-made dressing. Everything seemed fresh.  The service was fast and friendly and the food was a good value. I would probably come here more often if I wasn't so in love with the view and ambiance at nearby PORT."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Yummmm\"!! Their steak sandwich is great.  Done to perfection,  juicy,  tender and delicious. There were 6 of us and the only glitch was the Schnitzel sandwich.  Small on a big bun. Disappointed to say the least. Other than that we had a great meal and good time. Waitress was really nice and attentive but not hovering. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"We finally visited Massey's for a family birthday get together yesterday.  After reading so many rave reviews, I've been itching to try this place out and Massey's did not disappoint.    Located in a non-descript plaza next to a cupcake place, Massey's is literally right across the street (Liverpool, that is) from Zeera by the bay.  I must say, I don't frequent Pickering waterfront restaurants anymore since my not-so-pleasant encounters after writing an honest review about one of the restos down there.  But I digress.  Massey's looks quaint, even from the outside.  It exudes a homey, neighborhood hang out vibe.  And when you step in, it's an interesting mix of Jack Astor's bar area with flat screen TVs to the left and a laid back family restaurant with banquet seating (not all seating, of course) to the right.    We were a group of 9 so I am not sure what everyone ordered as we arrived slightly tardy with our 8 month old in tow.  There were Caesar Salads, baked nachos, sweet potato fries being shared but since I did not partake in them, I can't say how they were but the Caesar salad seemed to be a hit with my little nieces.    For our mains, we ordered Schnitzel (with sauerkraut), fish and chips, bunch of different burgers and of course, the steak on a kaiser.  I must say, I haven't been a huge fan of steak sandwiches in the past but Massey's offering has definitely made a convert out of me.  3 slices of thinly cut steaks were pleasantly marinaded and grilled to a perfect medium and for the toppings, your basic (but what more do you need, really) onion, lettuce and tomato sat atop a large bun.  The Kaiser was also good, chewy enough but not dried out buns sometimes you get at other joints.  I dribbled a little bit of H1 sauce for good measure and sunk my chompers to meet my match.  All in all, the steak on a kaiser was a winner for me.    I did get a chance to try out hubby's burger which was just HUGE!  It must've been at least 1/3 lb pattie.  Again, the pattie was grilled to juicy yumminess and topped with a slice of cheddar, onion, tomato, lettuce and an over-easy fried egg.  The runny yolk made a sticky eggy sauce to top this already over the top burger.  It was a good burger.  :D  Massey's was a great combination of good food, great value, friendly staff with a cozy neighborhood vibe.  I love finding little places like these and I have a feeling we'll be coming back to try out Massey's other offerings some time soon."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but I wanted to give a different point of view.  I used to work there and if anyone is looking for a job there be prepared that they don't treat their employees very well. The owner's son is a manager/bartender and is not very personable. They don't pay you properly. This was the first restaurant I worked at where I didn't get my tips that night. If the restaurant owed me money (because everyone paid debit) I had to wait a few days.  Food is ok, but just know you are being served by people who aren't being treated very well. And I wanted to warn job seekers that this might not be the job for you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant seems like an old family run joint popular among the locals. This restaurant is a nice refresher versus the heavily dominated chain restaurants. They have a diverse menu and good portions. AND portions are extremely important to me along with flavour!   Their pastas are a good portion and are yummy! The restaurant is located in southern Pickering not on a busy road but is usually thriving even on weeknights."}
{"text":"We had schnitzel with vegetables and chicken carbonara. I was surprised that despite the bad reviews I read online, I really liked this place. The carbonara was perfect. The schnitzel was okay though it could have used more seasoning in my opinion. Overall, a good place to go for dinner.The servers were nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Fries - burnt.  Steak - chewy. Soup of the day - made from scratch - tasteless. Mahi-mahi fish not fresh. Rice cake soaked in oil."}
