{"text":"I just had my first Hero burger ever, and it may be my last.  The burger has no flavour, besides the toppings which are mustard, ketchup, relish (strange tasting), and red onion.  The consistency of the burger is also very strange, like it's packed with fillers.  It didn't taste very beefy at all.  The website says it's gluten free but I'm not so sure about that.  On a better note, the fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and the service was good and the food was tasty. The wait time is always a little bit longer than a usual fast food joint and the price is a little steep and they charge xtra for guacamole but whatevs.   A few days ago I went and ordered a veggie burger (I'm vegan) and returned home only to take a bite and realize right away that something wasn't right. It turned out they gave me a burger with a beef patty and also cheese and mayo. I was really upset and horrified. I normally check before eating but I was in the dark because my gf has literally no light in her bedroom and I was super hungry. We walked all the way back to the restaurant and explained the situation to the manager on duty. She was very upset and apologetic and gave my girlfriend and I complimentary drinks and fries/onion rings while we waited for a new burger to be made. She lectured her staff about the incident and told me girlfriend and I that the next time we came in we could both have a free meal on the house. She really went above and beyond what I would expect from a fast food restaurant- I would have appreciated an apology and a new burger but she was very generous and understood why I would be upset and the implications of the switched burger.   I was ready to boycott that place right away because my diet is serious business but the fact that the manager went above and beyond means that I will definitely be returning again (even after I get my free meal).   !!~"}
