{"text":"The service was excellent. She was friendly and nice. When she took our drinks, she suggested some options and explained about the promotions. After that, we were trying to make a decision about our pizza and she told us we could make half pizza with one flavor and the other half with another flavor. This was the easier and convenient way to order our food. Overall, I  likeed my experience there and the price was ok. On the other hand, we ordered a dessert that was pretty normal and it tasted as any other sweet flavor you can buy in any grocery store."}
{"text":"Terrible place food (veal) came out ice cold, management took the food back and reheated it (didn't make new meal) veal was hard and tough. I had two small bites and left entire meal. Management made me pay for my meal even tho I didn't eat it!! Can't believe it I would of complained but was on date and was in shock by lack of fore thought. I have had other meals and pizza is ok at best I would not rate it as best just average."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I have had in a long time.  From a steak and pizza restaurant to boot.  Nice size portion of fries with a large piece of fish laying across the plate. Great friendly service too"}
{"text":"This is a locally owned business that has been around for a long time. I really enjoy the traditional-style pizza and have never deviated from that menu choice. I really like the thick slices smothered in cheese.

The rest of the menu, like decor, is a bit dated and needs to be freshened up. Having said that, it's a comfortable place with nice booths. The staff are friendly and it's a good little neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was great. The fish is Haddock  and the portion is big... 9 oz or more of flaky goodness."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the pizza joint we'd go to in vancouver when I was a little girl every Friday night. Family oriented, shirley temples and pizza that is packed with toppings and lots of gooey cheese. Love it...  I would argue it's the best traditional pizza in the NW."}
{"text":"Have tried Matadors quite a few times in the last few years.  I pretty much have only ordered the pizza.  It seems like they are trying to save on food costs more recently.  The pizza only has cheese on the top , wheras 3 or so years ago there seemed to be a layer of cheese on the sauce as well as on the top.  For the price I have to admit I have stopped ordering from them.  Try \"Pizza 22 and Ribs\" for takeout, in my opinion the pizza is better and so is the price."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away from Matador and I'm torn about giving this place a good review. 

They have been around a long, long time, but they do not understand the difference between service and hospitality. I suspect that is because they are a glorified pizza \"take out' joint with an attached bar. Many neighbours phone in their pizza orders and drop by to pick them up.
 
So it's an amusing, yet annoying scene, to be standing in their cramped entryway, thinking that you are waiting for a table, behind people who are waiting for their takeout pizzas, only to discover that you are expected to push your way through the throng to the front desk to get a table. The place is also usually full of local loyal regulars and crowded with seniors as their prices are very reasonable and their portions very generous.
 
While their menu is extensive, their food tasty, and their table service generally acceptable and prompt, they simply do not connect with me as they do not understand the fundamental notions of hospitality.  This is unfortunate. 

They never have the curteousy to acknowledge me as a regular customer, so I've stopped going there for that reason.  Having said that, I would still encourage you to try the place if you are in the NW, instead of the going to the restaurant chains in Market Mall.
  
Maybe you won't mind the indifferent service as I do.  There's lots of parking and they are now open until 3am in the morning."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed their pizza.  It's not for everybody, but if you like the thick cheesy type of pizza, this is for you. I feel the quality has slipped over the last couple times I've been there but haven't been able to put a finger in exactly what.  Perhaps it's the outdated atmosphere or perhaps it's the experience. Either way, the pizza is great, the pastas are average, nothing to brag about. 

The service is standard...never awesome....never bad, just get in and get out basically. Lots of regular customers which says a lot about a restaurant. 

If you're in the area, try out there pizza...you may like it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Well tonight my husband and I decided to go to our favourite pizza place, however tonight it wasn't \"up to snuff\". The server Jonathan was great, as he always is, however the duty manager was a \"whole different ball game\". I ordered my usual pizza Hawaiian medium sized. My husband's steak was the Sunday special.
 My pizza crust was hard on the edge, and the bottom of the crust was also not crunchy (but as hard to cut as the edge of the crust). I knew that it would be another 15 - 20 minutes to get a replacement. The second pizza was better, but not great. We have lived in Varsity for 32 years and so we are long standing customers. The server was great and told us no problem to replace it for me.
This duty manager lady was very rude to us, as she came over to our table and made statements about how this pizza that I sent back was the way they usually make them. She suggested that next time we order the crust \"lightly baked\". Her body language and tone of voice was very rude, as she seemed to indicate that we didn't give the correct order of how to bake the crust. Never in over 32 years of getting take out or eat in meals have we ever gotten such a hard crust. The server told us that a previous customer ordered a extra large pizza and got the same hard baked crust. If I can't cut the piece of pizza with the knife/fork then it is either over baked or the crust is not freshly made today.My husband politely said that we have ordered pizza for years and never had a problem. Unfortunately, according to this manager lady we were the problem, not the cooks in the kitchen. I think the owners need to know how this manager has to be let go, because of her rudeness to us and also to another couple who also wrote a review about this lady. The only good thing was a 50% off the price of my second time around pizza.
I have worked in many kitchens and I've always been told, \"the customer is always right, 100% of the time\". Maybe that manager needs to back to school."}
{"text":"A neighbourhood favourite!  Good beer, awesome pizza and a friendly atmosphere.  They have a pub side that has vlts and  a family resturant side.  The pizza is pretty pricey but it is the best thick crust pizza with lots of cheese and toppings I have ever had.  The servers love their jobs and have fun which makes dining or partying a pleasure."}
{"text":"Slop . Freezer food . Everything from gfs pre made . Nothing homemade in this place . Even the ribs are just gfs freezer food . Arrogant owners and management , doubt understand why ppl line up for this slop ?"}
{"text":"Oh I forgot about this place was there last month to try it out.....I got home and instead of sleeping I  floated the yeast in this pizza must be 90% anyways not going back ever and will not recommend it to anyone.life is to short to eat bad food....and pay for it."}
{"text":"I love Matador!  I always have the Matador special pizza which is so delicious & tasty and filling.

I like the atmosphere, one of my favorite pizza places in Northwest Calgary! 

Lots of other great food too!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is so disgusting!!
The rest of the food is pretty much mediocre to say the least!!
The desserts on the other hand are amazing!!
The creamy rose sauce on the tortellini is so watery they might as well bring the noodle without the tasteless sauce!
The pork ribs are nice & I love that they have half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent pizza (I like thick crust, and trust me, one slice will fill your boots!).  But if you don't try their Thai chilli shrimp appetizer, then you are missing out for sure.  It is so delightfully crisp, delicious, and spicy.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Okay, so if you don't know it by now, I may as well just say it. I'm having a love affair with pizza these days. I just can't stop. 

You can imagine my excitement when I was driving back from Market Mall one day and saw Matador Pizza & Steak House. I was with my boyfriend and we both agreed that we should try it.

The restaurant itself isn't super fancy, but the service is good. We ordered the zucchini sticks to start, and then a half-half pizza. My side was vegetarian (surprise surprise) and he ordered the carnivore's dream come true. We added on jalepeno peppers which really were la piece de resistance!

I really enjoyed the pizza. It was ouey, gouey good. For my tastes, it had a LITTLE too much cheese in it, but my boyfriend was ALL OVER IT. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed and unfortunately didn't have room for dessert.

I'd recommend Matador to anyone who's in the mood to dine in and have pizza. Just a note: DEFINITELY order the zucchini sticks and EXTRA dil sauce. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I'm actually writing this review not as a customer but as a food delivery driver. I do this for extra cash on the side and when I showed up to the restaurant my phone died from the cold (-35 is not kind to smartphones) I tried to wait for 5 minutes to get my phone on again but when I didn't I decided to go in and request they call and ask for a new courier, so the poor customer wouldn't have to wait on account of my crappy phone and instead of being met with cooperation I was met with two screaming people in my face. I assume they think I was trying to pass off work but considering I get paid for delivery and drove 20 minutes just to get there, this outcome benefited me in no way. They followed me from the kitchen to my car yelling profanities at me the whole way.

They couldn't see past their own egos to serve their customers in the best way and collaborate with the contractors who are there to better their business and I was appalled at the way I was treated by these total strangers when I tried to go in there and communicate with respect and professionality."}
{"text":"First time here, visiting from New York with my boyfriend. We decided that we wanted to go to a good steakhouse and it was good. The steak was well done just the way I like it. The whole wheat penne with Alfredo and oven baked cheese was good but I shouldn't have asked for the cheese because it overpowered the dish. The sweet potato fries were good as well. And we especially liked the baked potato that came with the steak, that was really good. Overall, not too bad of a place to try."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this place for years (probably over 20) and it is always consistently excellent.  Though it has switched owners over time, it has kept most of the dishes that have earned it a deserved loyal following.

Everything we ever eat, most of it repetitive, has come out as good as the last time.  Part of my family prefers the pizza, I tend to order the Alberta beef steak and sometimes we add on some salads or appetizers.

All I can say is, while Matador may not be an ultra fancy steakhouse, by eating here you are trusting a decades old business that continuously brings in a good crowd every night.  In fact, most Friday and Saturdays generally have a lineup for a table.  People of the neighborhood love eating here, and with good reason.  I feel this is as good as it gets for reasonable priced, excellent quality food."}
{"text":"We consider ourselves to be pizza connoisseurs, having eaten the best stuff offered up in Naples, Florence, and Sienna Italy....not to mention every other pizzeria between Calgary and Fredericton...

Matador's is not the traditional Italian fare, but rather Greek pan-style, which seems to be very popular here with; Spiros, Grecos, Paul's Original Pizza, Manies, Dover Pizza, Nicks, Odyssey Pizza, Inglewood Pizza, Bella Roma, Georges Pizza, are but a few examples of Greek pan-style. But currently Matador is our favourite!

Fantastic service, friendly attentive staff, despite being their busiest time of the day after 5pm, which is when we tend to go. Highly recommended if you can handle loads of high quality toppings, and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"We were craving a good, homemade pizza in the NW, not too far from home and Matador is what we came up with via an on line search. A self-admitted mom and pop restaurant, this place was built in 1976 and takes pride in staying the way it was and what it is meant to be. It specializes in pizza and steak and the owner will no undoubtedly come to your table and tell you that they are famous for: 
Caesar Salad
Steaks
Pizza 
Lasagna
The menu is wide and varied and had a decent drink list. My hubby's beer was served super cold just the way he likes it and our water glasses never went dry. Service was good throughout and welcoming. Wow, they have fried zucchini sticks here! They have seemingly gone by the way-side since my University days and I wish they were not so hard to find these days. I saw some come out on other tables and they looked fantastic! Next time...
We opted for 2 small pizzas - a veggie deluxe (the pineapple in addition to all the veg on it makes it deluxe) and a bullfighter which has veg and a ton of meat on it for the carnivore in our family.
It was tough not to get just 1 pizza to share and a lasagna but we will save ordering that lasagna as well for another time, as there will be one! The pizza, made with fresh dough was very good. No thin crust here however, it was light and flaky, almost as good as the best buttery pastry you have ever had! The toppings were fresh and I was so glad to see fresh mushrooms on pizza for a change - canned is a sin! I would have liked more sauce on my pizza but that is personal choice. I did ask for some on the side and sadly, it came cold right out of the fridge but we ate it. Next time I will ask for it warmed up. It was like an addictive, well seasoned tomato paste. Interesting and served the pizza well. 
The restaurant was not too busy on a Sunday night, the music not too loud and I really liked the dimly lit ambiance. It is a really nice place and the pics on line did not do the place justice. That said, you would be just as accepted here in capris and t-shirt than you would a nice dress. It is that kind of place, come as you are. I wish the tables had had linen napkins, the paper ones could have been eliminated but, that could be just our opinion.
There is a bar attached with some video poker games and some tables.
Matador was well-kept, clean and again, very inviting. We appreciated the owner sharing with us points about the restaurant and some of its history.
LOVE the fact that this place is open until 3AM every night. PERFECT for a night-owl like me! I want to try everything on the menu!

*Been back a few more times since this review - still just for the pizza which I still feel needs more sauce. Next time, I will ask them to make it extra saucy on the pie and see what the up charge is for that. The last time we went there last week, we ordered a half Hawaiian, half Deluxe Veg med. pizza. I understand totally that they would charge the $4 extra overall for the more expensive pie but to charge $2 MORE to make a half and half pizza because it is hard on the kitchen? C'mon! All that does is takes the server's tip from 20% to 15% as something has to give. I hope they can change this double-dip policy for the customers' sake or I will not be able to recommend this place to friends when they ask where to go for amazing pizza.*"}
{"text":"Decent experience at matadors on a Friday night 4-6 ish. Was not busy when we got there, I got the chicken tzatziki that came with soup and a Greek salad my gf got a build your own pasta that came with garlic toast. There was only one choice of soup seafood chowder was pretty meh, the rest of the meal was very good, great Greek salad. My gf said her pasta was pretty boring and nothing special she had also ordered cheese bread that was just forgotten. Service was okay definitely slow at times especially for such a small restaurant. Cheesecake was also quite good, may try the pizza down the road as we were there saw many ppl come for take out pizza."}
{"text":"I first dined at Matador when it was about 1/3 of its current size, shortly after it opened. Way back then, it was my go-to with my friends after school to share a pizza.

Fast forward many decades and I am back!  The decor has changed, the menu hasn't changed much and the food is exactly how I remember it. This is not artisan, Neopolitan style pizza - this has a thick, soft bready crust, a mildly tangy sauce and more cheese and toppings than your arteries will appreciate. They are famous for their lasagna as well - which again is smothered in gobs of gooey cheese. 

The menu includes other pastas, steaks and some Greek favourites. 

The service is friendly and efficient and the restaurant full of many generations of regulars. I don't eat a tremendous amount of this type of pizza, but when I am craving a thicker crust and tons of cheese, Matador is the only place that I will consider."}
{"text":"This restaurant is getting 1star right as I seat in. The receptionist asked me \"what do I want?\" What am I a beggar. You don't ask that to a customer. Rude. You asked them how are you and and how many to be seated. That's what I think the right question is. 

I ordered the Italian wedding soup. Came in good, broth was tasty. The meat was tender, but the macaroni was over cooked (too soft to my liking) 3 stars.

For the entree I ordered the 8oz AAA striploin, medium, with baked potato on sour cream. The plate also has mixed veggies and a pickle. The steak was medium as ordered. Was not really at par compared to the steak of other 'better' restaurants. It was juicy, yes. But the taste lack the sweetness of being a nicely prepared steak. It did not wow me. 2 stars. Of course you have to have a high expectation on this meal considering it's the most expensive item on the menu.

The waitress (with piercing on her nose) was nice, does her job well. The deal breaker was the receptionist (the fat lady). I would not recommend the place. Sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious food , good vibe.. Took them a long time to greet me understandable for Saturday.. the food was delicious just a tad over priced.. I have been to many pubs just as tasty half the price. The 4/5 star rating is reachable. Overall I'm happy with this pub!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon with hubby.  We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly and attentive during this fairly busy lunch rush. My hubby ordered the burger and fries special. Where can you get a nice juicy burger (not those flattened ones from McDonald's) and crispy, crinkle-cut fries for $5?   I had the soup of the day (cream of broccoli) and a pound of the salt and pepper wings.  Very hearty soup and nicely seasoned wings (However, their half-price wings special only applies if you sit in the lounge/bar.  Hmmm, it didn't mention this in the flyer...) We also ordered a large Hawaiian pizza to take home to our ravenous teenager.   Overall (if you check in thru Yelp, you get 20% off on regular priced menu items) the bill came to $32.    Pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! My pepperoni, back bacon and mushroom pizza was delicious. My hubby's lasagna was really good, especially the cheese. Service was good as well. Only feedback is that the tables are too tightly spaced together. Made us feel a bit squishy!"}
{"text":"For a place that has been around as long as you have you expect the same good food every time you visit. The service is alway excellent and the pizza is usually always the same but our food came out cold this time and the calamari is different. I usually go just for that but this time it was cold and rubbery. Sadness."}
{"text":"Totally classic Italian food and dining experience. I have a soft spot for this place as it is in my 'hood and they contribute to the community. 

The bar is also worth a visit. It has become a standard end of night nightcap venue before heading home for my peers. 

I don't think there will be anything here that surprises you, but that doesn't matter, it's a quality food and service location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my Sweetie and ordered the $5 burger + fries lunch special. It was tasty and generously sized! On top of this, they had a 20% discount for regular menu items if you first checked in on Yelp. Bonus! Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We went here with my family for my little cousin's birthday dinner. I dunno what it is about this place.. but she loves it and it was her birthday! 

The food fare here is comparable to an Italian pub.. do they have those here? I would describe it as pub-style Italian food. Nothing too upscale but then again the prices of the dishes were comparable to the taste and quality of the food. So technically, you're still getting your monies worth?

Anyway, if you're super hungry and live/work in the area and just need a whatever to eat, go for it. Otherwise, maybe just make some pasta at home? Nothing really stood out for me."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. 
I ordered $130 worth of pizza through Skip The Dishes for our staff as a thank you for all their hard work over Christmas and the pizza turned out terribly. 
The regular pizza had next to no sauce on it, was super over done and rubber, was so super salty that no one could eat it and the gluten free Mediterranean pizza literally had an entire layer of raw garlic on it; probably equivalent to about 3 cloves on each slice making it completely inedible. 
I called the store to give them some feedback and was told a manager would call me back. 
I got a call back from the same girl I spoke to the first time telling me the manager said I could have a free medium pizza but only if I picked it up or dined-in.  I told her that our work was in Greenview and that there was no chance any of us could leave to drive there to get it and she just repeated that the offer was only for pick up. 
When a customer takes the time to call with feedback so a business can have the opportunity to make things right it's a disappointing experience when a manager won't even take the time to call back or even apologize.  What even more disappointing is trying to do something really nice for your staff only for them to be disappointed, too.
We order lunch at least once a week from Skip but we will definitely not order or recommend ordering from here again."}
{"text":"pizza was good. it's not thin crust and it's not deep dish.... it's how pizza was before thin crust haha....if i were to compare, i might say the crust is like pizza hut crust in the 90's when people ate at pizza hut restaurants. I liked it.

veal parmasean was meh... hence the 3 *.

atmosphere is old school 90's family owned restaurant. The night we can it was super busy! lucky we went early and got the last table in the lounge. 

I saw other people getting spaghetti and steak."}
{"text":"For Pizza, this is a 4+. If you like a good heavy pizza with a good crust, lots of toppings and cheese, that is piping hot out of the oven, then this is your place. 
The restaurant is clean and inviting, and the servers friendly and efficient. 
There is a good number of TVs to watch the game. 
We have probably been there 20 times, and had 20 pizzas. So I really can't comment on the rest of their menu. I see lots of folks ordering other things."}
{"text":"The feel of this restaurant is a family restaurant where people have been coming for years to enjoy reasonably priced food.  The look of the restaurant likely hasn't changed for years and is a combination of booths and tables and chairs.  

The menu includes pizza, pasta, and salad.  I decided on ravioli with meat sauce for $13 and my colleagues had pizza.  The plate of ravioli was filled to the edges with generous amount of sauce covering each pasta bite.  The pizza had a thick crust and cheese covered the toppings.  I liked the meat sauce and it added taste to bland ravioli.

The service was slow at times but the restaurant was almost full.  This restaurant is ok and if you're in the area you may want to check it out for the pizza as that seemed to be a popular choice by many customers."}
{"text":"I love Matador. The pizza is great, but (and this is going to sound so weird unless and until you try it) I go for the delicious dill dressing on the tossed salad. Yumm! My other fave is the veal parmigiana - great tomato sauce for the pastas!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were looking for a place to eat in Calgary that was not a chain. We drove around, hoping that we would find something to catch our eye. 

Not much jumped out at us so we decided to check in on Yelp and see what restaurants were close by.

In order to do this safely, we had to pull into a parking lot to read our phone (please practice safe Yelping people).

Low and behold, there was a pizza and steak house - in the same parking lot we were parked!

We sauntered over to see what it was all about. I knew it was going to be a good choice when the sidewalk sign outside said long island iced tea was on for $5.

Imagine our surprise and pleasure when we sat down and looked at the menu only to discover that they had gluten free pizza! 

The pizza was scrumptious - both the gluten free and the regular. The crust is sure to please most people as it was neither very thick or too thin - it wasn't doughy or crispy and thin. The cheese was plentiful and good quality.

I splurged for dessert and tried their banana caramel cheesecake. it is a creamy banana cheesecake swirled with rum sauce baked on a banana bread crust, topped with cubes of banana bread and caramel sauce. It was incredibly rich and decadent!

The menu is much more extensive than just pizza so I would love to come back and try out more of it next time we are in Calgary. They have steak, seafood, pasta and some more great sounding desserts."}
{"text":"So I am from out of town and my local friend brought me here. 

To start, our server had a very sarcastic sense of humor, that to me didn't come across as funny, but rude.

Second, I ordered wings, honey hot flavor. They came out the wrong flavor. They were returned after waiting 10 minutes for the server to return. They came back as honey hot. But they were the same wings with just hot sauce added, so now cold. 

Our server was switched mid service, for no reason as our old one sat across from us doing roll ups. 

My main course came out. A chicken spinach salad with egg and raspberry vinaigrette. I took a bite and it was very yummy. It was a very large portion. But then I pulled out a black curly hair. 

I told them I will pass and am very disappointed. 

My friends waited 45 minutes for their pizza during all this, and got dill instead of ranch with it. 

I was very excited to try this place out and now, I wish I could give it a zero. 

The picture of my water is because it's the only thing they didn't mess up."}
{"text":"I quite like the pizza here and you will too if you enjoy thick, cheesier pizza. If you are into thin crust pizza with minimal toppings move on. In saying that it isn't cheap, but they do use quality ingredients on their pies. The reason I wouldn't score them higher is because of the service. Upon waiting for a pizza pickup I overheard the banter going on between two waitresses complaining about tips and their expectations regarding certain patrons who had been in earlier in the day. I understand these conversations go on, but please confine them to your off hours. It just makes me want to patronize another establishment that might appreciate their customers more especially in these hard economic times. Tips should never be expected, they are earned and with those sorts of attitudes I see why they may not have been given larger tips."}
