{"text":"The staff are super friendly and patient which is awesome because there are so many unique homemade flavored to choose from! A+ will be back"}
{"text":"The icecream is not usually as rich as Mitchell's (and rarely a bit icy) but the ingredients are high quality, and the flavors are so much more interesting and constantly rotating because they make such small batches.  There is always a good array of vegan offerings.  When their more interesting flavor ventures land, they're REALLY REALLY good.  The stroopwafel ice cream and rambutan sorbet they made this spring are two of my all time favorites.  The cones are homemade, they always have fun baked good adjuncts (churros, banana bread) and COLOR CHANGING SPOONS.  I love the attention to detail with toppings-- a drizzle of sweetened condensed milk for Thai iced tea, honey for the honey cornbread etc... My last visit in, I had honey nut cheerio (topped with Cheerios, of course), taro and honey cornbread.  All were awesome.  You can't help but love this place.  The owners and staff are warm, genuine and extremely chill.  Can't decide on a flavor? There's no rush, they encourage you to sample a few and let it come to you.  Their recent foray into ramen nights has eluded me twice.  They sell out early. Hoping to get my hands on a bowl this fall."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The banana split is out of this world.  Three scoops of your choice, two slices of toasted banana bread and your choice of pb or Nutella whipped cream.  I mean, come on.  I am a repeat customer and plan to be that way for a long time to come. Bravo masons, bravo."}
{"text":"I adore Mason's ice cream!   Not only are they great people, but they make great ice cream too. They are always trying new and different flavors. From olive oil to earl gray. I was blown away by the Cleveland Whiskey ice cream. It packed every bit of whiskey flavor without any of the heat you get from drinking whiskey. What a great way for non-whiskey-drinkers to see why Cleveland Whiskey is flying off the shelves.  They get creative with the toppings as well. You would not believe how good sriracha sauce can be on ice cream until you try it. It adds just a little kick and a lot of flavor to the vegan vanilla. That is another great thing - they make lots of different vegan flavors. There is always something fun for vegans to try like avocado or roasted banana.   Flavor, flavor, flavor! There is nothing like small batch ice cream. With Mason's Creamery you get beautiful subtle flavors coming through in each bite like a complex wine. I'll take that over the over-sugared and over-processed stuff any day!"}
{"text":"Everything that comes out of Mason's is a delight, and it's rare to visit without sampling something you never thought could be delicious as ice cream - think Froot Loops Cereal Milk or Whiskey Eggnog. This is not the place you go in and order simple chocolate or vanilla, though there's always a trade-standard-equivalent for those who refuse to challenge their tastes.   Even better? They make everything from scratch, right there, and sometimes on-demand: if you really adore a flavor and don't mind buying it in bulk, put in an order any time of year and over a few days they'll mix up a batch just for you to take home and enjoy. I haven't yet availed myself of this only for fear that I'll take it home, lock the door and feedbag the whole thing in one sitting.  I've been a devotee of Mason's since they were the friendly folks with the stand at the nascent Cleveland Flea; Jesse and Helen are what I would describe as a chill-power-couple. Having floated in their glow like some kind of dairy-treat-loving-moth for a year or so now, I can both claim a serious bias and attest that despite my fangirling, I haven't been burned yet."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Masons is one of those places that every neighborhood needs. Something that is unique and gives character to the area around. The location used to be home to The Ohio City Ice Cream shop and that place was great. When it closed, I like many others was heartbroken. But after hearing Mason's would be moving into the same spot, my dismay turned to hope. Before the brick and mortar location, Masons was usually at different events and festivals around the city. I'd always had trouble finding them to give them a try and now I know where they are anytime I wanna stop by.  I still haven't figured out how they do it but each time I've been there, they have some new creation to try out that is incredible. So far the nutella has been my favorite but what makes them great is that they take inspiration from fans as well. Recently I thought of the idea of passion fruit sorbet and ran it by them on a visit. Wouldn't you know a few days later, that flavor was in the store! AND it tasted great on top of that.  They use all natural ingredients sourced locally and it shows in the freshness in the taste of their ice cream. If you haven't been by the shop, go RIGHT AWAY. You won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high after so many good reviews and the recent article in the Plain Dealer but after going with my family of 5, and having several different flavors amongst us, we were not impressed.  There was a noticeable \"waxy\" taste/feel that was more noticeable with some flavors than others.  Not a stop that we will make again."}
{"text":"Bold statement: Mason's has the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had.  The staff is helpful and vibrant, and the flavors this week (including Thai Tea) won my heart over."}
{"text":"Taro icecream?! Sold. You have my heart and wallet, Mason's.  The flavors are unique and the texture is great. Come here for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Wow. What a treasure in Cleveland. This is really good ice cream and I am so glad I made it a stop on a trip to the city. If you like hard ice cream, this deserves a place on your must try list. Great stuff with even greater ownership."}
{"text":"Amazing option for vegans! This place kills it with their crazy flavors and non-dairy alternatives to nearly every menu item. Great spot for those who appreciate local business and local food. Such friendly workers as well! If you are visiting Cleveland and looking for ice cream, Mason's would be the first place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and owners, and there is always at least one (or five) new flavors to be excited for. A great neighborhood spot to chill with friends and family on a warm evening, and the ice cream is well worth the trip on cold evenings too! Bring back ramen plz!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious if you're looking for inventive ice cream flavors that are still a texture and sweetness that one wants from an ice cream parlor. We got pints with a couple flavors and they are still delicious the next day. The black sesame has a nuttiness (a more savory choice) that pared well with the sweet light taro ice cream. We also got oatmeal cream pie (exactly as it sounds!) and Mexican chocolate (a wonderful sweet heat with the cayenne).  They do cakes too! For my birthday a couple years ago I had  a vegan  cake with garbanzo meringue and vanilla lavender ice cream- so decadent! I've been to \"creative\" ice cream places before, but this one delivers the unique and still maintains that \"you scream I scream\" idea of this anytime sweet treat. The service was also super friendly. It's a little more expensive than something from the store, but obviously worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Mason's since they only had a food cart at Walnut Wednesdays. Now that their store is open, I love going to see what flavors they are featuring. Mason's make their own custom flavors for ice cream and sorbet including vegan options, cones, and churros for ice cream sandwiches. Today I ordered the Vegan Shirley Temple Sorbet, my sister had the Honey Cornbread (drizzled with fresh local honey), and my father had the Banana Pudding. Yum!  Even our dog got a little treat, the Sweet Cream ice cream made just for dogs (and on the house, so thank you!!). This little gem is located in Hingetown, and even does special events such as Ramen Nights and Movie Nights when the weather is good. The owners and staff are genuinely friendly. Mason's is a must for Clevelanders and visitors alike."}
{"text":"They have extremely creative rotating flavors.  They even accept flavor suggestions which seem to actually be considered.  The owners and people working here are extremely nice and let you sample as much as you want to.  The first time I went here, I tried vegan olive oil and vegan pumpkin pie.  Both tasted very natural and flavorful.  Their vegan ice cream is slightly less creamy and less sweet than other varieties.  The 'less sweet' aspect turns out to be a refreshing difference.  The non-dairy base is made from hazelnut milk and something else (I forget), not coconut or soy.  They explained that it is made from scratch, not a mix, like some other vegan ice cream in the area.  There are more regular dairy flavors than vegan and those seem to be very inventive as well."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, the best ice cream place in Cleveland. The flavors are unique, nothing tastes or is artificial and the ice cream is so incredibly creamy. The owners and staff are amazing and every trip I have made has been a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Lots of great flavors. Had 4 dairy free options, which is amazing! Flavors were all fun- go here, super fun! It's a little neighborhood place surrounded by homes, super cute! Oh- don't forget the temperature changing spoons- cool touch."}
{"text":"BEST ICE CREAM in Cleveland! I haven't had a single bad experience with their ice cream. They rotate their selection, and I've had the good fortune of trying most of the flavors they offer. My favorite: black sesame -- very good black sesame flavor! Their dark chocolate ice cream is the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. I also enjoyed their Thai tea ice cream and avocado ice cream! Even their durian flavor ice cream was amazing!   Every once in a while, they offer ramen, which is an added bonus! Think about it - RAMEN & ICE CREAM! How awesome is that?!   The owners are some of the coolest people you'll encounter here in Cleveland! They greet you and offer samples of everything! They're also very responsive to Facebook messages to their business page.   I love this place and their ice cream is seriously addicting! :D"}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place but there are just better local places to get ice cream in Cleveland - including Sweet Moses just down the street.   Their flavors are creative but the ice cream is watery and icy. The flavors don't seem to stand out on their own."}
{"text":"Great ice cream. We walked here after dinner in the neighborhood. Well worth it. Ice cream flavors change regularly.  We had Thai tea, salted caramel, pumpkin, and flan. All very good. Flan is very subtle. Try it on its own as it can be easily overpowered. It was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the building itself is really quaint and cute. After that you have some pretty delicious hand crafted ice cream! They even have vegan options and ice cream sandwiches. I had the churro ice cream sandwich with french toast ice cream and Ohio maple syrup on top, and that was pretty amazing!   The staff is beyond friendly and helpful! Also, they are all about the samples which i love, because you never know if you will truly like something, as good as it may sound.  Stop by if you are in the Ohio City, Hingetown area and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Mason's Creamery, drop what you're doing and go now. Best ice cream in Cleveland. The employees are cool and fun. Try everything!"}
{"text":"Was going for an evening walk and saw the lights of the little outpost beckoning like an oasis at the end of Bridge Ave.  Great staff -- didn't bat an eye lash when I tried two flavors and then settled on a third.  Went for the double cookie, with chocolate chip and homemade cookie dough.  The cookie dough was stand-out.  So so so good."}
{"text":"Great icecream! Not a lot of thought enough to gave a decent variety.  Prices are ok, but I don't mind supporting local eatery's."}
{"text":"There were no flavors with chocolate when we came. They said they ran out because of a busy weekend. So, I had a scoop of Nutella and a scoop of salted caramel in a waffle cone. Both flavors were mild, and not very different. The waffle cone was soft and mushy, not fully cooked.   I would have given it two stars, but my husband found his flavors satisfactory - even though each of his flavors were not very different. He had cookies and cream and salted caramel. His waffle cone was cooked and not soft like mine."}
{"text":"Love it! I really enjoyed all the different flavors. Very friendly staff and the shop ads charm to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We went tonight not expecting much! We were blown away with how good our ice cream was! The staff was extremely friendly and the ice cream tastes like it was made with love! We can't wait to go back and bring our dog with! We're going to spread the word about how amazing the ice cream was!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Northeast Ohio. The folks who own it are incredibly nice. Great neighbors, great business, great eats. Try the banana bread split!"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, friendly staff. Got the hibiscus ice cream and ohhhhh myyyyyyy. Mm mm. Funky little shop and perfect place to chill on a warm, sunny day with a homemade waffle cone full of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Not only do I love their rotating flavors (so happy they do a lot of \"Asian\" flavors like thai tea, matcha, black sesame, etc.), I love their aesthetic/community as well. I follow them on instagram, and they seem like very cool people. Now if they would just start selling through local grocery stores..."}
{"text":"Big fan! The ice cream is so good, but more importantly the service is awesome. The time I tried this place I must have sampled 5 kinds of ice cream. The second time I went, which was the next day, I sampled the remaining flavors. Great place. I will definttily be a regular this summer!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites from Mason's Creamery is their Cap'n Crunch! Not only are the individuals that own this place some amazing down to earth people, but their staff and most importantly their ice creams and sorbets are one of a kind! If you're in the area, it's worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Cute little ice cream parlor in the heart of a gentrified neighborhood. They only had 3 vegan selections to choose from and 2 out of the 3 weren't at all tasty. The toffee one that I chose was ok and the prices were pretty good. The guy that took my order was pretty cool and very accommodating, he explained the ice creams that I tasted which was helpful."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in town and the staff so always helpful and nice. The array of flavors is constantly changing so there's always something new, and delicious, to try. I don't know what took me so long to review this place."}
{"text":"If you have not been here yet-- Shame on you! If you are still reading this and not on your way there--Shame on you! This is one of thee best ice cream places i have ever encountered. They reeled me in with all their Instagram photos, so yes, social media/marketing does work!  I was slightly disappointed to learn that they are not open during lunch hours. This might be better though or I might drive there weekly during lunch and not eat substantial food. I did learn that they will be open longer in the summer when they add more help. I did drive to get ice cream immediately after work and this was probably the best decision I have made in a long time.   This place is FANTASTIC! They change their flavors weekly but always keep a few Classic flavors the same. I have been drooling over their Instagram photos for months but what got my lazy butt to talk about them non stop was the picture of their Ohio Snow Cone- which of course is what I ordered. French Toast Ice Cream (tastes like the milk from cinnamon toast crunch), topped with cotton candy, bacon pieces and drizzled with maple syrup. Love in a cup is my name for it. I have never eaten anything so fast while enjoying EVERY bite. My boyfriend ordered the Churro Ice Cream Sandwich with Salted Caramel ice cream in the middle. That was extremely delectable that I am pretty sure I will be back within the week to order one for myself!  Note: They will offer to let you try as many flavors as you want without a stink eye if you end up trying all of them.  Thank you Mason's Creamery for making adult ice cream dreams come true!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable and great service! I had the Honey Nut Cheerios ice cream with the cookie butter and it made my heart melt. Definitely recommend and me and my girlfriend will be back again! Keep it up"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The flavors are all so unique and delicious and they are more than encouraging of you sampling any flavors you're interested in. The girl behind the counter was super cheerful and patient with us. The outdoor patio is a fun setup to enjoy your ice cream on as well. I am kicking myself for not getting here sooner!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ice-Cream! Definitely one of my favorites! If your in Lakewood definitely stop by! Try the Banana bread! It's breathtaking :)"}
{"text":"Mason's served me the blandest ice cream I've ever tasted.  I wanted to like this place. It's local, seems to be in a great location, has a cool vibe and seating, and is close to our friends' place in Cleveland. Their website even shows that they have gained some local notoriety and Alton Brown likes them. That would seem to be a recipe for fantastic ice cream.  The problem was product. Hunny and I got two different flavors (green tea and Vietnamese coffee). Both had an icy texture rather than a creamy texture, and both were practically flavorless. Hunny said there was only a \"suggestion\" of flavor. This is a fair criticism based on the two flavors we tried. Baskin Robbins is better than what we got that evening. Seriously! Clearly Mason's is doing pretty well in the media, which presumably comes from being more \"hit\" than \"miss.\" I'm hoping we just got a bad batch.  On the plus side, there are unique ever-changing flavors, dog treats available for your pups, and vegan options for those so inclined. The owners seem to be creative and passionate about their craft, which I respect no matter what you're serving.  I'd be willing to give Mason's a second chance, but the ice cream would have to blow my mind next time to get them to four stars. I feel like I wasted my money - their product ain't cheap."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times but each time was fantastic. They always have such interesting and dynamic flavors. Earl Grey is delicious for tea lovers, and the vegan options are reliably tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream every single time. Last visit, I had a scoop of Carrot Cake (with fresh carrots) and a scoop of Caramel Corn (with popcorn pieces/ caramel topping) and both were out of this world. BAE had the Peppermint Bark (which included HOMEMADE bark). All were amazing.. They let you try endless flavors and will even offer ice cream from the back. Even strange flavors like Chicken and Waffles (with waffle and chicken/chicken skin pieces that I subbed for dinner) were unreal.   Worth the trip from the suburbs, or anywhere for that matter.  If you have an Instagram (and the willpower), definitely follow them because they post pictures of current flavors (no spam)."}
{"text":"so many choices of ice cream.. And not all your typical traditional ice cream.. Masons takes to the next level and a must try...Wow"}
{"text":"Exterior/Location: West side Ohio City  Interior: small, not particularly pretty...but they have ice cream  Vibe/Ambiance: hip and artisanal   Staff: younger kids that know and love their ice cream  Clientele:  Anybody  Price: truthfully, I didn't pay... So I didn't pay attention  Must get items:  maybe another flavor than the Vietnamese coffee   Why I love or hate it: I hate to give this place less than a stellar review. I have read so much good on Yelp, so I was confused why I might be the only person who is not gushing over Mason's. I got a small cup of Vietnamese coffee and chocolate. My ice cream seemed like it lacked cream. It tasted like ice crystals!  I actually threw half of it out. Maybe it had frost bite? My entire family was sort of disappointed. It's tough to mess up ice cream. I'm not sure how they did. On a positive note, the staff was super nice and cool. They let people suggest flavors for them to create. I'm glad I tried it, but for the calories... I'd rather eat Jeni's ice cream in Chagrin Falls.   Final thoughts: Not worth  the calories."}
{"text":"I believe I might have found my new favorite place for ice cream in Cleveland.   Mason's Creamery is a quaint little shop in a quiet neighborhood. The staff is very polite, and unlike a lot of places, they actually offer you to try samples of their ice cream before you place your order.   On my recent visit, they had a drawing of Chunk from the Goonies doing his classic \"truffle shuffle\" which encouraged me to give their ice cream of the same name a try.   The small ice cream is a nice portion. The truffle shuffle was a chocolate ice cream with a truffle swirl. I also got their Nutella whipped cream, which might I say, I wish I could buy by the drum full.  Did I also mention that they give you color changing spoons?!  They have more flavor to try, and I can't wait to try every single one."}
{"text":"I am a loyal fan of Mason's! Not only is the ice cream wonderful, but their staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful. The flavors are well thought-out and sometimes unconventional, though consistently delicious. I wish they would extend their hours, but I know they're a small operation and have a limited number of employees. Please open more locations! We would love to have you in the western suburbs!"}
{"text":"So good! I love how they frequently change ice cream flavors. Their ice creams are on the lighter side and aren't overly sweet. They also have a large variety of vegan ice creams!"}
{"text":"Bee's Knees! Literally the best ice cream made and served by the best people. This place is a gem and works with local businesses to collaborate and help Cleveland shine brighter. I highly recommend you stopping in and treat yo self!"}
{"text":"Mason Creamery's ice-cream is really underrated. But, I've noticed they been picking up steam and good press around Cleveland and the local food scene. They offer a lot of unique flavors, all home-made, and very delicious. Some of my favorites include vegan coconut, Vietnamese coffee, and the pistachio honey. They add a different flavor every so often and return the popular ones upon request. I'm also a fan of their root beer floats, which is my favorite thing.  If they're ever around, definitely stop by for a scoop !"}
{"text":"Loved this place- wish it was closer to my home.  Though I had tried Mason's Creamery at the Asian Festival a couple years ago, it wasn't until I heard about their ramen night that I was inspired do drive all the way into Cleveland to get some legit ramen.  I didn't make it to the first ramen night, but I'm proud to say that I was first in line for the second one.  They didn't let me down.  The ramen was really good- even after I had taken it, driven 25 minutes home and waited for my family to sit down and eat.  Broth was DELICIOUS.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I didn't want to share with The Wife and The In-laws.  Next time, I'll order more.  Great job with the pork belly- done perfectly.  Noodles had congealed a little bit by the time I got home, so they weren't ideal, but it was definitely better than any other ramen I've had in CLE.  They should make it a permanent part of their menu.  And move into a bigger facility- crowds would definitely come.  Since I was already in the area, I figured that I'd try a pint or two of their ice cream.  I got vietnamese coffee (AMAZING- even my wife who isn't easy to please raved about it).  Creamy, authentic, drizzled with condensed milk.  I'll order more next time I go out there.  Lychee sorbet was less successful.  The texture was off- even if the flavor was legit lychee.  I wonder if it could have been pureed more to get a better mouth feel for it.  Anyways, an awesome experience.  If I lived near to them, I'd be there all the time, especially if they served that awesome ramen."}
{"text":"According to an article this is Ohio's top ice cream place and with reason! I only came here twice but I loved the creativity with the different flavors. The owners also take flavor suggestions. I tried my friend's egg tart with ice cream and I ended up finishing it haha, it was really good and fresh! Service is great, there's plenty of seating outside, and it's cutely decorated. I also heard that during the summer they play movies for the community to watch right outside the creamery!"}
{"text":"I've been following Mason's Creamery for a while now. And by following, I do mean following -- finding out what farmer's market, festival, or other event they'll be at, and then doing whatever it takes to get myself there. I've had Mason's Creamery at Lakewood farmer's market, Tremont farmer's market, Walnut Wednesdays, Cleveland Flea, Hingetown.... and I love it every time. I actually think that Mason's Creamery may be my all-time favorite icecream -- yes, I think I now love it even more than Jeni's! The flavors are just so innovative, and the icecream is somehow very light and refreshing, never overly creamy and rich. Their hot chocolate and strawberry balsamic icecreams are some of my favorites, and the vegan flavors are always amazing too. Plus, service with a smile every time. I can't wait til Mason's Creamery opens shop in Ohio City so I can save myself from running around town!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best ice cream I've ever had. I tried the Captain Crunch and Pumpkin flavors, both were to die for. Flavors are a little muted compared to other ice cream places but I think that works in their favor. Incredible waffle cones too."}
{"text":"This place makes homemade fresh ice cream with unique blends everyday, along with homemade waffle cones. Five stars isn't enough of a rating. I'd easily give it six. I chose the Taro and Rhubarb Streusel flavors. They also serve dairy free options (they had four at this particular time).   I'm from Utah and I can only wish that we had a replica of this place where I lived. Super friendly staff, superior customer service by Jesse (not the Mason Jesse), and easy transactions.  The ice cream is classic and beyond delicious. It is not too sweet and has the right amount of flavor to satisfy your palette. The atmosphere is a combination of nostalgic, traditional, and trendy."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors. Service is great.   Small, cute ice cream shop in the middle of a neighborhood with cute lights outside. Great place for a quick pit stop for a yummy treat.   I love the workers here. They are very kind. I never thought I'd ever try a Hazlenut Baklava ice cream, but I did and it was DELICIOUS. There were tiny baklava pieces in the ice cream. If this is still a flavor, I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I see that Mason's Creamery on Yelp gets all the stars from all the Yelpers. Me too! I have never been to the location in Ohio City, but today I went to Cleveland Flea and after lunch, but before leaving, I ordered the vegan avocado ice cream, which is made of cashew milk, avocados, and a little sugar. So basically, it was healthy ice cream. And it tasted really great!"}
{"text":"Awesome creamery, no doubt about it ! It seems like its in a kinda weird place but I don't live in Cleveland so maybe not but it was a little hard to find.  It's super tiny as well and if you are not looking for it you just might miss it. If you do find it, make sure and stop in for some GREAT service and GREAT ice cream.  This is not your grandma's kind.  Vanilla or chocolate?  no, no, no....  Their flavor selection is much wider and the people working there make it even better.  Right when you walk in someone greets you with a really friendly smile and hello.  They tell you if you want to try anything to just let them know.  Okay, I want to try everything.  No problem.  I guess we went in there right as they were changing out the flavors from the day time to the evening time and we ended up trying about everything.  I seen where others said they had red velvet.  Not today, but they did have a bunch of other really different kinds.  Wifey got some kind of blueberries and wine.  I got cake batter and and a few others.  One of the workers said that since we came as they were changing flavors and they kind of got mixed up what we were trying they only charged us half price.  Even more bonus points for them!  After we ate 2 scoops each, we decided we needed more and tried a few more flavors.  Secretly, I wanted more but my wife and doctor would have a hissy fit so I had to shut it down.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great service and great ice cream.  It's good I don't live close because I simply would not have the willpower to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I myself am not the biggest fan of ice cream but oh my goodness isn't this place fantastic! This cute little ice cream store is a delightful addition to Ohio City. The moment I stepped into the store I know I'll come back again. The store is bright, clean, and artistic. They got a blackboard made into a wall with colorful drawings and menus and fun messages written all over it. There are cute little plants decorations everywhere. The staff is very friendly and let me try as many flavors as I wanted. He was also knowledgeable about the ingredients that go into each single flavor. I also had the beet jar strawberry vegan and french toast flavors and both are very delicious. But the brown butter pretzel is a MUST try as it's so creamy and the flavor is done so perfectly!! Can't wait till the weather is warm enough to sit outside the store and enjoy more of their ice cream!"}
{"text":"Mason's, I wish I could quit you... but with the ever changing menu, I have to return way more often than I should admit! I've had sooo many different flavors here, and none of them have ever disappointed me. Besides the fact that the ice cream is high-quality and delicious, it's just fun to be able to try something different every time I stop by. I always just get a couple of scoops to try the flavors, but they do have more elaborate options on the menu, including ice cream sandwiches and egg wafels.  The shop itself is pretty tiny, and staffed with some of the nicest servers you could ask for. There's almost always a decent line, but it moves pretty quickly, and I've never had trouble finding a place to sit down and enjoy my tasty treat. They also have a wall on the back where customers can suggest new flavors, so let then know if you have any ideas!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty experienced ice cream eater, and after my many years of eating ice cream, this is my new favorite place. Great ice cream, delicious cone that complements the ice cream, and great service!  I tried the thai tea, french toast, pumpkin pie, sweet potato pie, and salted caramel. And these are the most accurate flavors I have ever had. The french toast actually tastes like french toast! I felt like I was at brunch, except I was actually eating ice cream. And they even added maple syrup on top of the scoop! I thought it was a nice touch. With the thai tea flavor, they also added condensed milk on top. Each ice cream flavor here is truly perfection. Creamy and flavorful. And the flavors actually taste like what they say they are! Also, the array of flavors here are vast and original. I have never seen a sweet potato pie flavor! And it is exactly what sweet potato pie would taste like too.  The cone here was also beautifully crafted. They are made in house and go well with the ice cream.  Outside, there is seating with cute lights. And there's a mural of an ice cream cone too! (Very IG-able)  Also, the staff here are very friendly, and didn't get irritated by my sampling. They even offered me more samples after I had ordered my ice cream! They never seemed annoyed or anything."}
{"text":"Wow, we love this delicious local ice cream shop with flair! They're always rotating what ice cream they have \"on tap\" and there is something for everyone. They have flavors ranging from mint chocolate chip to black sesame so there are classics and unique flavors as well. The ice cream is super creamy and has a whipped texture: so yummy! The staff are always extremely friendly and personable. They're very encouraging of samples so you can make sure you're going to like what you get. They are dog friendly (inside and out!) so you can walk down with your pup and get them a doggy cup. It's small on the inside but it feels cozy that way. There's a bench, a few bar stools, and three tables for two. They also have a large patio which is great for the busy summer. I definitely recommend this place - great for the whole family and people visiting enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"A tiny delicious spot in the the middle of Ohio City. Stopped by on a summer afternoon after hearing so much about it on social media. I was looking forward to all of their unconventional flavors! Arriving here, I wasn't disappointed. Inside they had their freezer labeled with plenty of unique options. I opted for the Vietnamese coffee and Coconut in a Waffle Cone! Oh boy, was it great. As an East Coast loyalist, the consistency and flavor of the ice cream was definitely on par. No blizzard or concrete needed - the ice cream here spoke for itself. The hippie in me also really loved that they used reusable sampling spoons. And the outdoor space was really cute with string lights and picnic tables for seating. The only thing that I would change was to make the cone a little bit more substantial. As the ice cream melted, the cone started to crumble a bit. But otherwise, I'd definitely suggest Mason's as a dessert spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Mason's I'm blown away by the amazing flavors. Every time. Just when I think I've found a new favorite flavor, they put out something new, fun, and inventive, and I have a new favorite.   On my most recent trip, we stopped in for a late night treat. The staff was super friendly and chatted with us and pet our dog. They let us try some flavors to help us decide. Honestly, I wanted to try every single flavor, but stopped myself and just tried a couple.   I settled on a scoop of cookie butter (!!!!) and a scoop of cocoa puff (with cocoa puff cereal topping). Both flavors were out of this world good. The cookie butter basically tasted like Trader Joe's cookie butter straight out of the jar. And the cocoa puff tasted like chocolate cereal milk, it transported me right back to my childhood. my boyfriend settled on french toast (with a maple syrup topping) and brownie batter. I got a taste of both and they were great. I would definitely recommend the french toast, and the brownie batter was good, not a rich as you would expect, which I really liked. We also split an order of churros, which they brought out to us, just made and still warm. OMG so good. the perfect pairing with that delish ice cream.   Bonus, they also gave us a mini scoop of vanilla for our pooch. In an edible cup, in case he decided to eat that too. I thought that was so cool, I love any place that loves dogs.   I'm not kidding when I said I wanted to try every flavor. Everything was just so fun and inventive. They have flavors that I've never seen anywhere else, and every single one sounded so good. I'm excited to go back and try the Thai tea flavor. They also have a bunch of vegan flavors, usually at least 3-4 every time I'm there. The vegan strawberry jam is my favorite so far. They're doing great things here, they're making some of the best ice cream I've ever had."}
{"text":"I think this place is more for locals rather than people passing through. I was really excited to try this place after seeing reviews, pictures, and previous flavors on the website. I was pretty disappointed when I came in to find mostly regular flavors - chocolate, strawberry, banana, butterfinger... however there was lavender vanilla and brown butter which we tried.   The lavender was tasty, but ended up just tasting like just vanilla after a few bites. I got the brown butter as a churro ice cream sandwich. The ice cream definitely didn't have the nutty browned butter flavor I was expecting. They make the churros fresh, but I don't think mine was completely done. It was really doughy and didn't have enough cinnamon, but I think they may have rushed it because they put the wrong flavor in the middle the first time (they kindly and gladly remade it and gave us our money back before I even noticed the mistake). I asked for one scoop of ice cream in it instead of two. It gave me a stomach ache.   The staff were very friendly and informative, so happy to hear about all the locally sourced ingredients. It's a great concept, but seeing how the flavors are always rotating, it might not be a place for passer-bys since it's a gamble. Maybe we didn't get any of the original flavors because we came during the slow season?"}
{"text":"Updating my review from four to five stars because I was back for another visit last night, and I was excited to see interesting, creative, and yummy flavors. I was also impressed with the improved texture of my ice cream this go around. I got the lavender ice cream which absolutely delighted my senses and my hard-to-please elderly friend enjoyed his oatmeal cream pie ice cream \"very much\". I can't wait to go back and try some other flavors (blueberry mint, lucky charms, frenvh toast, etc.), or a cookie ice cream sandwich, affogato, or a waffle cone."}
{"text":"This place is so nice and the owners are wonderful. They have great dairy free options so don't let that stop you from visiting. So many great flavors and options and you can try them before committing to a scoop or two. One day I said they could probably make kale taste good, and out from the back came a yummy mango and kale ice cream!"}
{"text":"Very tasty ice cream in delicious and unusual combinations. The cinnamon toast crunch was my favorite. The space is very cute and so is the staff! There is also a great selection of vegan options."}
{"text":"5 stars for Mason's Creamery! I had been following them on instagram for a while @masonscreamery and finally got a chance to check them out at the Cleveland Flea and the Tremont Arts Fest. They are a roaming ice cream store that sets up shop at local markets and places, kind of like an ice cream food truck.  What I really appreciate about Mason's Creamery are the down to earth owners (Jesse and Helen) who care about their craft and their customers. They are also interested in finding great flavor combinations - ones that feature local Ohioan products like Cleveland Whiskey, Rising Star coffee, paw paw (local Ohio fruit), and other great ingredients. They are also not too sugary/sweet, which is friendly to my palette.  Some of the flavors I've enjoyed are the salted caramel (yummm), rising star coffee, cleveland whiskey, green tea (subtle and good!), and vegan spiced squash. I also enjoyed a sample of paw paw... I hope to get it again since the growing season is so short. Everyone try them out!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to get to the Creamery for awhile and today was our chance....such a great experience! Their flavors are fantastic and really unique. Super friendly. The boyfriend loved the different sorbets they had available. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome selections with very different and unique flavored. It's all made from scratch and the taste proves it! I had a fresh espresso with a scoop of ice cream and the combination was astonishing! Their whisky ice cream is also beyond toothsome. It's a quick walk or ride from west 25th, accessible from the 22 and 26 bus routes."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream with flavors you won't get anywhere else. Can't wait to try the ramen! Staff is awesome. It's a great spot to bring the community together."}
{"text":"I have been to Mason's twice now and both times I have not been impressed. I went a second time because I thought I was crazy for not loving them like so many people do...  I had Pumpkin Pie, which tasted okay as a sample and my boyfriend had Butter Pecan. They both lacked the creamy texture that you would expect from ice cream and tasted more like freezer/ice and fell apart as we ate it.  The ice creams taste like they barely have any of the main ingredient in them, seriously lacking flavor. It was a sad day for our tastebuds and my waistline because I finished eating it since I paid for it and didn't even enjoy it.  On the bright side, they play good music, have cool decor and a nice vibe, and color changing spoons.  I'll stick to Mitchell's and Sweet Moses."}
{"text":"I'm in loveeeee! The people are amazing and so are the sweet goodies. I found out about Mason's Creamery from the night market and boy am I happy that I did. So far I've had the flan, black sesame, Vietnamese coffee and jackfruit (all great flavors btw). Can't wait to try more flavors along with the sandwiches. Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"How can Cleveland be so lucky to have so many stellar ice cream options?! The flavors range from traditional to truly unique and it's so fun to try the ever changing menu. I like getting ice cream sandwiches from there. They are also totally immersed in the community too. We are obsessed with their ramen pop up nights. I recently had a baby and they went above and beyond standard customer service. Really grateful to be neighbors with an awesome and delicious business."}
{"text":"The location, the shop's vibe, the service, and of course the ice cream were all so amazing.   My boyfriend and I walked in and were greeted by some super friendly workers who offered to give us tastes of \"everything\"! And we took them up on that! Actually, we only tried about half the ice creams but they were all so delicious.   What impressed us were the assortment of flavors! French toast, tamarind, chocolate lavender, tres leches, and dunkaroo! They got me with the nostalgia; we got a dunkaroo chocolate chip cookie sandwich. Seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten!  I know they also have a ton of \"sandwich\" cookie options, freshly made waffle cones, churros, and espresso! Yes please!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ice cream shop ever. It's so unique and cozy. Everything is homemade (ice cream, waffle cones, etc). They have flavors such as French toast where they drizzle some maple syrup on your ice cream, Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk glaze, taro, graham cracker and so much more. They switch out flavors too depending on the season. It amazes me how much the flavor tastes like the real food. You can try the flavors before ordering which is great.  Something to note is that this is a very small ice cream shop. Majority of the seating is outdoors so during the summer, it's packed. During the winter, there isn't really anywhere to sit since about only 10 people can fit inside. However, don't let the space deter you because it's super cute. They have string lights and picnic tables outside, murals around the store and it has an old diner kind of feel. I come here all the time all year round!"}
{"text":"My husband and I can't stop coming here. Every flavor we have tried is rich and delicious. We're going to get so fat this summer!"}
{"text":"What a great local ice cream shop. Love the artisinal small batch flavors they make. Nice selections all the way from your normal dark chocolate to Vietnamese coffee. And a variety of vegan flavors from vanilla with sweet sriracha sauce to mint watermelon as well. A nice variety of ice cream sandwich option and the awsome egg waffle."}
{"text":"After taste is that of garbage. Only ice cream I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"Getting to sample the flavors is awesome, I often get something unexpected. Apple cider sorbet and baklava have been my favorites by far. Staff is always friendly. Definitely a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I first came for their 2nd Annual Ramen Night, and stayed because of the ice cream. It's a pretty tiny space located in a quiet residential area beyond the main thoroughfare of Ohio City, but very worth the pit stop. Helen greeted us at the counter despite having been assailed by ramen-crazy Clevelanders all day, and Jesse was super patient with us, urging us to try nearly half of the ice cream selection available.   Mitchell's is true blue America, but Mason's has a lot of the Asian inspired flavors I miss from California. Among my favorites were the Taro, Black Sesame, and Ginger Molasses. Prices are also very reasonable! You can squish two flavors into a medium for $5.50 or get a small for $4. Extra for toppings and a waffle cone. Got a flavor request? Let them know and they can put it on the list of dream flavors - which may or may not actually become reality. There's a few counter seats and small tables scattered inside, but if weather permits you should take advantage of the patio tables.   Even if you're a frequent customer, it's hard to get bored because the flavors rotate and they also spice things up with floats, churros, and cookie sandwiches. Next time I come, I'll definitely be trying some of their Affogato. It's a treat to watch them pour the thick syrup over a scoop of ice cream, and I can't wait for that to get in mah belly."}
{"text":"Adorable and friendly shop on a corner with modern flavors (some vegan) and an ice cream consistency on the lighter but still smooth side. Had a lot of fun with the spoons that changed color according to temperature XD"}
{"text":"I went to Mason's Creamery for the first time last week and had one of the best ice cream experiences. Not only was the staff super attentive and friendly but the ice cream was delicious and the flavors unique.  The texture was light and refreshing, and getting three scoops allowed me to try a variety of flavors. I especially liked the dark chocolate.  If you like ice cream this is definitely one of the top places in town to try."}
{"text":"i don't think i'm drinking the koolade here. it's like ok, i hear the owners are nice, the place is cute, but i come for the ice cream and so far the flavor has not made any big impression. i've had some assortment of vanilla, salted caramel, and cake batter with cheerios. it's just kinda one dimensionally flavored stuff."}
{"text":"So finally my wife and I get some time to try mason's creamery. After learning about them from foodie Alton Brown while he toured our city during his time spent in Cleveland for his show he happened to stop into this establishment. So first off I want to say how extremely friendly Jesse was from the minute we walked in till the time we left. One of the first things I said when we walked in was I was here on recommendation from AB.  Before we decided on our order he offered us a sample which was an AMAZING apple cider sorbet or it might of been an ice cream. It was not yet available to order because he just made it but he was nice enough to go in the back and get us some samples. Was by far the best thing I tasted today! Other flavors we tried were salted caramel, an orange flavored ice cream tasted like an orange julius but kicked up with nutmeg,egg nog with Cleveland whiskey, and then we ended up getting a small chocolate chocolate to share. I chatted with Jesse for what seemed to be about a half hour all about how it was to meet Alton brown to how he got into the ice cream business to how and where he gets his ingredients. He explained everything is local and fresh and he makes everything from scratch. Since we live on the east side of Cleveland it's not very convenient for us to get this amazing product all the time but it's worth the drive out if you want awesome ice cream.  Go out and try Masons creamery support an awesome dude and help him grow his business. Plus how can you go wrong with a friendly guy pushing free samples at you ? :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. What a cute little gem to enjoy! I'm a simple ice cream girl, so this place is overwhelming for me, but the simple flavors like cookies and cream are to die for, cause they make them! The ice cream sandwich with the lightly salted warm chocolate chip cookie is ridic!!!! Lemon cake was my favorite flavor, so unique and fresh. Come check this place out, they do movie nights in the summer!"}
{"text":"Definitely a very good ice cream place in the Ohio City/Hingetown area! However, if you want some traditional ice cream, this might not be your place. Most of the flavors here are very unique, but very good! I know that every time I come to Mason's, I'll be able to try something I've never tried before! Also, they have a great wall that's just perfect for Instagram!"}
{"text":"I found this place online and the flavored looked interesting so we decided to check it out. It's a very small place, very comforting and friendly. They have new flavored each week so the owner was encouraging us to try all the flavors. I had the peach ice cream and French toast ice cream. My wife had salted Carmel and popcorn. Prices are very reasonable, highly recommend!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of the few time where the qoute \"the snozzberries taste like snozzberries\" were they may not have had snozzberries but I did try the popcorn ice-cream and that is exactly what it tastes like a wonderful buttery, salty, and complete perfection."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop comes really close to making the mark, but the ice cream texture was very watery and full of ice crystals.   I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of flavors of ice creams offered and thought many were very creative. However many were lacking in intensity of flavor, coming off as a little bland. In addition, there was something off with the consistency of the ice cream itself. Many flavors I sampled felt a little watery and not as creamy as they could be.   The ice cream here is about average, especially if you compare the product to Jeni's ice cream."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is simply amazing! They have very unique flavors. The customer service is superb. They allowed me to sample several flavors.  The lavender and cream ice cream was very delightful...it has real pieces of lavender in it. The cookies and cream ice cream is real cookies and cream. If you have not been to Mason Ice Cream Shop please go TODAYYYYYYYYY!"}
{"text":"Earl. Grey. Ice. Cream! Now imagine that sandwiched between two piping hot churros! The sandwich holds up just enough so that you get a instagram-worthy photo- but it's a hot mess after that. The churros are heated up when it's ordered so the heat from it melts the ice cream way too soon. I would suggest asking them to give it to you on the side or have them not heated up.   I also tried the macaron sandwich. Earl grey definitely meshes better with the churro than the macaron.   The owner was super friendly and took her time to explain all of the flavors and the development of their store. Fellow Californian! Unfortunately- none of the other flavors caught my attention besides the earl grey."}
{"text":"Got a salted caramel shake that was amazing staff was a delight. I would definitely recommend a stop when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very good ice cream! I liked the selection of flavors even though a little limited which I expected being an artisan spot. I went with the pumpkin pie, salted caramel and oatmeal cookie. Like I said, the taste was very good...I'd say more creamy than normal, however, I like my ice cream chunky. The oatmeal cookie had some good chunks in so that was a plus for me. I will certainly go back but for me, Mitchell's is still the best in Cleveland.   Small parking lot that fits 4-5 cars, the rest is parking on the street. Lot's of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have constantly changing flavors and take suggestions for new flavors. Ice cream is not too overpoweringly sweet, doesn't taste overly artificial, and texture/consistently is smooth but not too milky. Their egg waffle goes great with all flavors, and they have nutella whipped cream! People working here are friendly and offer free unlimited samples before you decide what you want. It's located in a small neighborhood but I've never had an issue finding parking."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here! The ice cream flavors were unique while still being delicious. The Thai iced tea flavor, topped with sweetened condensed milk, was my favorite. The color-changing spoons were fun, too!"}
{"text":"Mason's Creamery is a new ice cream business that debuted at the Cleveland Asian Festival a few weeks ago.  I stopped by their stand multiple times for scoops to keep cool during the festival weekend.  Since then, they are making the mobile \"Food Truck\" stops such as the Cleveland Flea today (6/8).  Their unique ice cream flavors are inspired, delicious, and freshly made from scratch in small batches.  Like a fine chef's menu, they rotate flavors and discover new ones as creativity moves them.  While they offer some typical flavors (chocolate, salted caramel, green tea) I like that many of the flavors are unique and often Asian inspired like Vietnamese Coffee with sweet condensed milk, coconut pandan, mango lime and chili, and curry with Sriracha.  They just came out with a Cleveland Whiskey flavor that sounds interesting to try.  They also offer Vegan options such as roasted banana with peanut butter and honey (this sounds good!), lambic raspberry, and more.  They will soon be offering their ice cream in pint size containers also for home enjoyment.  I also like the design of their \"ice cream stand.\"  It has that old fashioned ice cream parlor feel with wood and metal counter top with metal buckets.  See photos.  Bottom line is that Mason's Creamery offers wonderful unique fresh Ice Cream that is definitely worth searching out.  Give them a try.  They are on facebook and post their flavor offerings and locations that they will be at.  Like and follow them."}
{"text":"Wonderful lucky charms ice cream! Thanks I needed this! A great in season specialties too and a few vegan options too."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to warm up to Mason's.  I'm a creature of habit and Mason's likes to switch up their flavors often!  I've found that since their inside seating is area is limited, it's best to go to Mason's in warmer months when I'm really craving ice cream.  When I'm eating ice cream outside in the cold with brain freeze, it ruins the experience and the flavor.    Mason's always something unique to offer if you're in the mood for trying new things. I appreciate this as it forces me to try something new. Last time, I tried taro ice cream and was surprised that it was actually creamy without sugar overload.  They also had some time of apple/cinnamon combo that was DIVINE.  I had a few bites of my husband's ice cream and had to restrain myself from eating all of it.    I believe they list their ice cream as all double scoops, but one time, they did just let me have one scoop so don't be afraid to ask. and try something new!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite ice cream shop in all of Cleveland and believe me I have tasted almost all of them. Incredible inventive flavors, super staff who really want you to get what you would like best and aloe you to taste as many flavors as you please. Our favorites so far have been, captain crunch, marzipan, oatmeal cream pie and banana pudding!"}
{"text":"I probably just gave myself the diabetes, but I have no regrets! This place is awesome! Stopped by with some friends and we were instantly greeted by friendly and personable staff. They had no problem with our indecision's and pleasantly offered for us to try all of the flavors if we wanted to! (I love that they use real mini metal spoons for the tastings as it always makes me sad to see a ton of plastic spoons the trash). While I wasn't ecstatic about the flavors (love that they are homemade with local ingredients) I did find a little piece of heaven in the Philomena Banana Bread dessert. Mmm so good! It's two slices of homemade banana chocolate chip bread that has brown sugar brûléed on one side then it's topped with 3 scoops of ice cream of your choice (I chose just one scoop of banana and one scoop of vanilla) then some whip cream of your choice (I chose nutella) and finally a drizzle of sauce. They really blow your mind when they serve it with a spoon that changes color when it touches the cold ice cream. I took my $8 sugar coma and we all sat out on the patio ($8 seems like a lot but this dessert is enough for two). One of staff came out and offered us some water, and get this, he brought a regular sized cup! Not some tiny two sipper. I really appreciate this as I could be a fish with all the water I drink.   Seriously, next time you're craving a treat stop by Mason's Creamery as you'll enjoy the ice cream, the great staff, and you can even bring your dog."}
{"text":"Came here for the Vegan option for the bf and the high reviews on Yelp. Cute place where they homemake their ice cream in the back and weekly switch up flavours.   Bf ordered vegan vanilla cinnamon ice cream with churro sandwich ($6). The churro was crunchy and freshly made. The ice cream was very soft and melted very quickly.  I was very disappointed by this place. Had higher expectations from Yelp. I sampled: 1. Captain Crunch: Tasted like captain crunch but a bit sweet 2. Mint chocolate chip: Impressive since they use fresh mint which you can taste, but overpowering for me 3. Apple cider sorbet: Soft, tasted like apple sauce even the texture 4. Bakalava: Very flavourful bit did not like the heavy amount of pastry in just the sample! 5. Same cake-like flavour: Okay flavour, bit heavy.   Ended up getting small 2 scoop ($4): 6. Taro: Good flavour, not the purple colour you get other places.  7. Earl grey: Tasted like the tea. Nice flavour.   ******Reason why I give 2 star: Good flavours initially, but overtime I tasted the heavy oily cream texted on the roof of my mouth. I hate that feeling, too much oil from the cream. That is the downside to this homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"Lovely little local place with locally-made fresh frozen desserts.  I got blueberry sorbet and vegan banana (as I am lactose-intolerant. boo.) Sister got Lucky Charms (lucky!) and a butter finger sort of ice cream.  She said they were very good.  My blueberry sorbet was outstanding, but the banana tasted like something I could make at home with a yonana maker. Should have sampled it first. OH well.  It was a lovely evening, so the outdoor seating was on point. Worth a drive or walk to try if you're in the area visiting or after a baseball game."}
{"text":"I love masons with every inch of my heart. You know how most places say they have a food/ice cream/dessert that has a specific flavor but it just doesn't quite get it like the original? That's not Masons! Every flavor tastes exactly as you'd imagine (French toast, Lucky Charm, Dunkaroos... to name a few), and often comes with an exciting topping (maple syrup, actual cereal pieces, sprinkles). If your sweet tooth is really up to the challenge the chocolate chip cookie sandwiches are to die for... but you can't go wrong with a waffle cone either! You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't tried masons yet!!!"}
{"text":"The owner let us sample anything we wanted, went to back and gave us new freshly made ice cream too. Super friendly people and DELICIOUS ice cream. Unique flavors like popcorn, lemon meringue pie topped with whipped cream and cookie butter! Yum! Made in small batches from actual milk not a mix. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mason's is a cool place to get some unusual flavors of ice cream in Ohio City.  Stopped in after watching a taping of the Daily Show at the St. Ignatius auditorium.  Mason's is located at the corner of Bridge and W.44th, it can be easy to miss, since the sign says \"Ohio City Ice Cream\".  You will find a hip place with ice cream flavors you will not see anywhere else.   The flavors available on the day I was there included Halavah, Baklava, Flan, Sweet Cream and Taro.  The ice cream base is nicely creamy, without being overly fatty, smooth and with a great mouth feel.  I sampled the Taro, which had a mellow Taro flavor.  I had a cup with the Halavah and Flan Ice Creams, they were both excellent, the flavors are a bit mellow, but very distinct.    Mason's also has Vegan Ice Creams available.   Mason's is a great place to get some very unique ice cream flavors with a great smooth base and subtle, yet distinct flavors.  If you want a fun experience, give them a try."}
{"text":"WOW! I cannot say enough good things about the ice cream here. Absolutely fantastic! The flavor combinations are far from original with options for having it served with cookies, churros and more. The staff is always very friendly, helpful and doesn't seem to mind one bit if you test out every single flavor."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just found out about this place!! Their ice cream is homemade and is more delicious than sweet Moses or Mitchell's. I loved their dark chocolate and pecan pies. People there are so friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"Jesse and Helen have created such a great culture with their venture going out of their way to make people comfortable while providing some of the best / unique ice cream (vegan options also)."}
{"text":"Taro and Nutella hand made daily. I'm in love, too bad I only come to Cleveland about 3 times every 43 years.   Great service from Jesse, not the one that owns the place. Awesome guy.   Metal spoons to sample flavors. Non descript place that just nails it, service with a smile and people who really love what they do."}
{"text":"I had a couple different flavors and was not impressed. The seasame ice cream had a grainy texture. The siracha was meh. The service was amazing. However I can not fool myself into more than 3 stars"}
{"text":"So dangerously within walking distance of most parts of Ohio City, including my own!  You will be hard pressed to find flavors as unique and inspired as those at Mason's Creamery. My faves so far this summer in a two-way tie: Cocoa Puffs and the chocolate lavender.  I love the standout topping options too. I've had chocolate ganache, peanut butter whipped cream, various cereals and Nutella whipped cream. DELICIOUS!  The outdoor area is lovely too. There's several tables and heaters throughout, if you're coming on a chillier day.  The customer service is always tops too. The servers seem very knowledgeable about not just the flavors but the processes by which they were created. They're also super generous with the toppings. It's date friendly, kid friendly, riding-solo-friendly :)"}
{"text":"Small, local business with high-quality ice cream and a friendly staff! The flavors are constantly changing, so it's always fun to go and try new things. And they are generous with their free samples to ensure you pick one that is just right.  Does it get any better? Actually, yes.... You can choose to smush your ice cream between warm, fresh cookies, waffles or churros.  Last night I went for the butterfinger and brownie batter flavors between chocolate chip cookies, and as usual, I was not disappointed. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Inventive flavors. Knowledgeable and very friendly staff. Everything I needed to turn my day around! Looking forward to my next visit. Every one will feel like your first!"}
{"text":"Seriously am in love with this place! I am an ice cream lover, so whenever I travel I have to try the best ice cream around and I think this is it! So when you ask people what is the best ice cream in Ohio, many people will name the big most common names of ice cream but that wasn't what I was looking for...I was on the search for the best ice cream, the diamond in the dirts...the gems and I found it here on Bridge Ave (it took a lot of searches on my end).   The location is probably an area I would never go to if I was just driving around, luckily I knew where I was going. Upon entering there was a beautiful outdoor seating area but it was too cold to sit down so I went in and was immediately greeted by the people in the front. The customer service was amazing, they strongly encourage you to sample every flavor as every day the flavors change. All of their ice cream and sorbet are freshly homemade. They even provide for vegans!   I was so hesitant on what to get as EVERYTHING was soo good but I heard that they were known for their churro sandwiches in which it is a warm churro in between two scoops of ice cream which can range flavors. I got the churro sandwich with graham cracker and ginger snap ice cream and it was delicious! The churro was so warm and it melted the ice cream so delicately. The ice cream is served with a spoon that changes colors which is so cool! This place has been open for 2-3 years and is literally amazing--all for $6!! I encourage everyone to check this place out! Great customer service, delicious freshly made ice cream, and great options! I am spreading the word on this hidden gem!  P.S.  They even honor military discounts."}
{"text":"You had me at churro.   I had the churro ice cream sandwich with Vietnamese coffee ice cream (topped with sweetened condensed milk!). I tried most of the flavors before making my decision and they were all delicious which made it really hard to choose. Honey cornbread and monkeybread were some of the others that piqued my interest.  The staff was super friendly, helpful, and accommodating and didn't even get mad or annoyed when I accidentally knocked over a table and broke one of their flower pots (I'm ridiculously clumsy, especially when I'm focused on food).   I can't wait to come back and try more of the weekly flavors! And super excited for Ramen Night!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place so much. The ice cream flavors are so unique and culturally diverse. For example, I just had a combination of Matcha Oreo and Halva ice creams! They also have other fun flavors like: Vietnamese Coffee, Hojicha, and Marzipan. Each ice cream definitely tastes like what they claim to be- definitely not something to take for granted. Each flavor has a unique consistency to is as well. The best part of this establishment is the service from the people who work there. They are so patient while customers try all the flavors and love input for what their new flavors should be. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for locally sourced quality ice cream in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Mason's creamery is a real gem. Go to superelectric and stop here for ice cream. Interesting flavors combined with a homemade waffle cone divine! Friendly service cute neighborhood shop. The color changing spoons are especially fun! It brings out the kid in everybody."}
{"text":"This place is great. We got ramen on one of their ramen days (not always available check their instagram). This is not really an eat-in experience but that's totally ok. We ended up enjoying our ramen from the plastic takeaway containers so we could indulge in ice cream after. We had a \"flight\" and tried Marzipan, Halva, Baklava, Pineapple Upside Down and Taro. All fantastic and from what I hear the flavors are constantly changing. Staff is great too. They'll give you ice cream for your dog if you have one with you. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Service and Ice Cream!! When I walked in I was greeted by a smile, the staff was friendly and let me sample every flavor with no problem. I really recommend the Affagato and the Churro sandwich. Salted Caramel flavor is personally my favorite."}
{"text":"We stopped in Cleveland for lunch with a friend at Happy Dog and spied \"Ohio City Ice Cream\" as we drove out of town. On a whim, we stopped and we were not disappointed. First off, they weren't quite open yet, but they didn't blink and served us up delicious scoops of homemade ice cream in delightful flavors. I had the peanut chunk and malted chocolate, and even though I'm supposed to be on a diet it was worth every delicious bite. My husbands salted caramel was too salty for me, but he enjoyed it immensely. My daughter reports that the hot chocolate ice cream was \"Wonderful\". Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Only tops for these guys.  My wife and I and Baby just moved to Cleveland from NYC and sometimes miss variety.  We unexpectedly moved into a place a block away from this creamery and can say what a variety for your tastebuds .  Jesse and Helen are just a great duo and the team of people doing the supporting roles are fantastic as well.  I really hope the best for this establishment."}
{"text":"Love love love Jesse and Helen- the service is out of this world- more like the glorified old days where everything seemed more personal and their ice cream is love personified. It's incredible! The flavors, the quality, the care that goes into each batch- it's ah-mazing!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for the ice cream here and want to like it so, so badly. However, I was torn whether to give it 3 or 4 stars. My first visit here last summer, I felt forced to find a flavor I liked but they all tasted so \"icey.\" A year later, gave it another go and was much more satisfied but still not completely impressed. I can't pinpoint what it is exactly- the flavor concepts are there but not so pronounced, and the texture seems a little off, not as creamy as it should be.   The atmosphere is so fun, especially in the summer. Be prepared to wait, but the line seems to move. The menu has some unique options for your ice cream- from the cookie sandwich to the tasty egg waffle. Can't forget to mention the flavored whipped cream...nutella anybody?! Settled on the black sesame and almond flavor (amaretto maybe?), which were satisfying after a big dinner. Flavors rotate, and I'd be willing to give it another whirl!"}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream! We used to go to Honey Hut, but this is our new favorite! The owners are friendly and explain everything on their menu in detail. They encourage you to sample all the ice creams they have to offer! My husband and I got the caramel macchiato, I can't stop thinking about it and want to go back tonight!!"}
{"text":"After trying Mason's, it becomes my No. 1 ice cream store in CLE. Try Thai Tea and Taro flavor. You won't regret it :D"}
{"text":"We have been in here a couple of times now.  Friendly and engaged owners who seem to have chef power when it comes to creativity and flavors.  Planning to go back this week and give some proper attention to detail and try some new things.  Winter ice cream seems right here, due to the above average taste scale.  The tunes and atmosphere appeal to the neighborhood scene.  Helen and Jesse have found their niche. I can see people driving across town to visit this place as the word begins to spread.  This is the ice cream you are looking for.... foodies."}
{"text":"Mason's is one of my favorite places in town! The staff is always so friendly, the owners are the best as well! I don't have anything bad to say about this place! The ice cream is always amazing, they change flavors like weekly or twice a week. They started serving soft serve as well that is just as good!   If you ever make it in, get an egg waffle or the banana bread split if they bring it back!  They even do a pop up ramen night and it's definitely worth it and legit!   But always get there early or as soon as they post something on their Instagram because it will will out before your eyes lol but in a good way.   They even have vegan options!!!"}
{"text":"Mason Creamery/Ohio city Ice cream (if you go by the sign on the building) is an amazing experience. They have friendly a staff, amazing ice cream and a charming location. The staff is genuinely excited to have to you try all their unique flavors!! I recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Long overdue review.    This place would get 3 stars without serving anything.  A rather dark corner of my neighborhood has been transformed into a bright gathering place by the energy of this friendly, energetic young couple.  It's a testament to their efforts that I see crowds gather at an ice cream shop in the cold, grey depth of the Cleveland winter.  The actual product pushes Mason's over the top.  \"Grocery store grade\" ice creams beat you over the head with sweetness and flavorings.  Even some premium brands are rather intense.  THIS is the place to go if you want a true flavor experience.  After savoring pints of the Rising Star coffee and salted caramel, the thing that stands out most is the subtlety.  This is a premium product that caresses the taste buds with enticing, subtle hints of the featured ingredients on top of a solid base that is not cloyingly sweet.  Not cheap, but the ice cream equivalent of a meal prepared by a master chef."}
{"text":"The best local ice cream around! Mason's is the perfect pick me up, any day of the week! We live right around the corner, and stop in probably once a week. I love how they are so adventurous with flavors and concoctions and they really do take in all the feedback they receive to make the best ice cream possible. They certainly have interesting flavors, but they always have amazing classics as well!  The couple, Jesse and Helen, who run the place are the sweetest ever, which makes me love coming by even more. They have done a lot for the community and it makes me thrilled to have people like them in our neighborhood.   Also, one of the best parts is the staff is so generous and love dogs, that they always give my sweet pup a free doggy scoop of vanilla ice cream!  Also make sure you try out their ramen nights - they are delicious but get there early as the line is killer! They also do fun movie nights in the summer and bring in food trucks. Just the best!"}
{"text":"Only better ice cream I've had is jeni's in Columbus, and that is a maybe. All the flavors were spot on, I ordered the red velvet and cinnamon toast, and just as I was about wrapped up I spotted a brown butter pretzel that looked to legit, so I asked if I could get a taste even though I already had decided.   The friendly staffer behind the counter was happy to oblige but warned me I might regret my earlier choices.  He was right, so good! Rich smoky butter with salty pretzel chunks mixed in, awesome comfort food in a frozen package. So I ended up with a third scoop, poor me.   Then I met the owners who are super nice and shared their back story, all around great experience and I'm glad I stopped by. My Mitchell days are gonna be a lot fewer now, or I'm just going to have a heart attack from ice cream overload."}
{"text":"Weird flavors. And after trying Jeni's this was well below. People behind the counter were great. I don't mind some weird flavors but most were weird like rosemary sea salt caramel. It tasted like foccacia bread as opposed to ice cream."}
{"text":"All hail the local ice cream gods of Cleveland, Helen and Jesse!   To start, Helen and Jesse, the owners, are two of the most hardworking and kind folks in Cleveland. They care so much about their product, their customers, and being a part of the neighborhood. They've become such a key part of CLE's foodie scene and Ohio City's identity. While they have a storefront, you can also catch them frequently around fairs and other pop up events.   You can literally taste the difference in their ice cream... that small batch, homemade love comes through in every bite in their classic, seasonal and vegan flavors. My favorites are the Mint Watermelon and Nutella...I could literally eat the whole tub if no one was looking. Wait, did I say that out loud?  Once a month, they also do a Ramen \"Night\" (which actually starts early afternoon), where they serve until it runs out (so get there early. Trust me, there's a line). As if the ice cream wasn't enough, they easily have the best veg and non-veg ramen in Cleveland, totally filling that niche. Its buttery, flavorful, and tastes the way ramen should. Its a miracle someone finally accomplished excellent ramen in Cleveland. Only Helen and Jesse could casually do ramen on the side for fun, but still have fantastic ice cream.   If you haven't checked this place out yet, what are you waiting for? The inside is small with limited space, so the next time it's a nice day, grab some ice cream (and maybe some ramen!) and sit outside to support this fantastic local business."}
{"text":"Great addition to the OC.  The owners are super friendly and they have a great variety of regular ice cream flavors and a very good selection of vegan flavors.  Their freshly made churros are great and you can get a churro ice cream sandwich!  Yes, you read that right.  CHURRO ICE CREAM SANDWICHES!!!   They are amazing.  Their regular ice cream sandwiches are nothing to sneeze at either.  The cookies are huge with gigantic chunks of chocolate in them."}
{"text":"THOUGHTS: Overall, just a trendy hype. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. This is not to say that others may leave overwhelmed. I went with a group of three on a Saturday night. Line was out the door, but service was efficient. My intent was to order the egg waffle; at least, that's why I made the trek. I saw the assistant in the back bring the egg waffles out upon order and they were quite soggy, rather than crispy. So, I opted for a macaron instead. I sampled three flavors; taro, graham cracker, and Oreo mocha. Sadly, they were all too light in flavor - like water. I was embarrassed to ask for a four sample, so I just went with GC. Overall, it was okay. I feel the hype is more so for the aesthetic and trendy options they provide (like egg waffle, churro sandwich, etc.). My guest ordered a churro sandwich and waited 20 minutes for it (we were quoted 5 minutes). We found out later on it was crossed off the list. They did apologize though. It was something to cross off my list, but I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Very creative flavors i.e.. Key lime pie ice cream rolled in graham cracker bits! Captain Crunch ice cream topped with my favorite guilty pleasure of years gone by, oh my!  Do yourself a flavor and stop in!   (And, yes, pun intended)"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place sporadically, but what finally prompted me to seek this place out was a combination of a friend's recommendation, as well as another friend from Indiana who wanted to get good ice cream in the Cleveland area.  I was very impressed with what Mason's Creamery had to offer. Egg waffles, which are very difficult to find in the states, were sold here as a an accompaniment to the ice cream selection. The ice cream selection itself was very unique, as they made their own ice cream flavors and the selection changes on an almost daily basis.  The Facebook page mentioned that Mason's was serving Ovaltine ice cream, something I really wanted to try as Ovaltine is a staple breakfast drink for me. While they didn't have Ovaltine available that day, I was able to sample hot chocolate flavored ice cream instead, something I had NEVER had before. It was very very good, and had all the flavors one might expect from a hot chocolate, only frozen. The salted caramel, a more common ice cream flavor, tasted a lot better than what I'm used to from other places, so I ended up getting an egg waffle with salted caramel ice cream, hot chocolate ice cream, and Nutella whipped cream.  Talk about pushing the boundaries of ingredients and experimenting with brand new flavors. I'm often skeptical about new fusion styles, but Mason's nails it with the execution. The Nutella whipped cream has all the texture of whipped cream but all the rich flavors of Nutella. The egg waffle, rather than being stored and used like other waffle cones, is made fresh on order and tastes really soft and chewy. The salted caramel and hot chocolate flavors blended very well with the whipped cream, and the egg waffle absorbed all the flavors very well. Everything fit together super nicely, rather than being a mish mash of different flavors that were fighting each other for dominance.  It's rare for me to have ice cream this good, and it definitely ranks among the best I've ever had. This place is HIGHLY recommended to anyone looking for a one of a kind ice cream experience."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Ohio City within a good walking distance of West Side Market. They have awesome flavors here. I got a churro sandwich Taro+Matcha-Oreo & my boyfriend got a churro sandwich of Thai Iced Tea+Cap'n Crunch. SO. GOOD. Even without the cereal, the ice cream STILL tasted like Cap'n Crunch!"}
{"text":"This is a cool ice cream joint. I'm giving this place five stars for how fantastic the customer service is and the uniqueness of the flavors. They are always taking suggestions from their followers as to what flavors they should try to create next. Being a bit of a traditionalist my favorite was the the captain crunch ice cream. I'm a sucker for cereal on my ice cream. The cookies and churros for the ice cream sandwiches are also amazing."}
{"text":"The ice cream here is fabulous.  They have very unique flavors here - the lychee flavor in particular was delicious.  But.. the real reason I wanted to write this review was to comment on this restaurant's ramen night.  Widely publicized in Cleveland foodie circles on Facebook, this little ice cream shop decided to take on a valiant endeavor during two weekends in the winter to try to introduce authentic Japanese ramen to the Cleveland community.  I attended the second ramen night, and I am pretty certain there will be a third.  While I applaud these guys for the effort, I unfortunately was disappointed by their ramen.  The ramen broth was great, the meat was great (though a bit on the fatty side and I wished I had more of it), and the egg nearly perfect (slightly on the raw side).  However, the noodles did them in.  The noodles were doughy and quite unpleasant.  I am hoping that for the third ramen night, these will find a different source for their noodles.  Then I'd definitely be coming back for a second helping."}
{"text":"This place has some seriously awesome flavors! I was really sad I didn't get to try a churro with my ice cream (they closed down the fryer since it was 15 min. to closing time), but I was still very pleased with my experience.   They have so many unique flavors, but also a couple standards. They apparently change regularly. I ended up getting a scoop of Tarot and a scoop of Cap'n Crunch. The Cap'n Crunch is made by letting the cereal soak in milk and then using that milk to create ice cream. It tasted exactly like the cereal milk AND they topped it with the cereal pieces.   The Tarot actually just reminded me of a really delicious sweet cream ice cream.   They were really cool about letting us sample multiple flavors too."}
{"text":"Mason's is a good place to throw into the mix of ice cream joints. They have intriguing, yet tasty, flavors. The place is definitely more expensive than Mitchell's, which is just up the road, but does offer flavors Mitchell's probably will never add to their menus. The ice cream is smooth, but you can taste the chunks of ice within. I know it's called \"ice\" cream, but any good ice cream place should have a product that is much more creamy and flavorful than it is icy.   I recommend adding it in your ice cream shop list, but not as the main go-to. It is also incredibly small so if you go when it is cold out, unless you snag one of the three or four tables inside, you're either eating outside or in the car."}
{"text":"I hate to be a Debbie downer, and maybe I picked the wrong flavor, but I was not impressed by my brownie batter ice cream! The signage out front is confusing, it says Ohio City Ice Cream Co. Or something but it's Mason's. My ice cream tasted very fresh but wasn't very flavorful. The staff was very friendly and nice, and it's a teeny tiny little building but it's pretty hip, as you would except for the area. However, I think there are much better local ice cream establishments (Mitchell's for example?). I'm glad I gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite ice cream place! Not only do they have the best servers, but they also have interesting and fun ice cream flavors!   I walked in on a quiet Sunday afternoon and I was immediately greeted by the server. My friends and I tried (almost) all of their flavors and they were always very enthusiastic about them! There was no limit, and I loved that all of their spoons were metal. One of my friends told the server to surprise him, and the guy clapped his hands in excitement! He ended up with a chocolate and coffee milkshake with chocolate ganache swirled in, nutella whipped cream and a hot churro inside! (AMAZING)  The flavors at Mason's change quite often, but they are always delicious! I ended up getting Coconut pudding and dark chocolate orange. My only regret is that I did not have enough room for their Taro flavor, which was creamy and very mild in the sweetness. The decoration is very cute and rustic. The whole experience is very fun and tasty!"}
{"text":"I tried the churro ice cream sandwich with chai and dark chocolate ice cream.  Pro: CHURRO...what else needs to be said Interesting flavors - loved the chai  Cute store and plenty of outdoor seating  Cons: Bit out of the way without a car, but not too bad of a walk the chai ice cream was more icy than creamy (I prefer my ice cream really creamy so that was disappointing)  Overall: Would go back again if I am in Cleveland. It's a nice alternative to the famous Mitchell's."}
{"text":"Amazing, that's all you need to know. Everything you'd ever want in an ice cream shop. Quality, variety, flavor, and the most incredible owners you could ever hope to meet. Add their involvement with the surrounding community and you have perfection"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My number one go to for ice cream in Cleveland. Located in the Ohio city hingetown area. Every flavor I've had of ice cream is superb. My favorite is the matcha green tea ice cream when they have it. Love that they create unique flavors. They also have vegan options as well and sorbets. Once a month I've noticed they do a pop up ramen shop. Superb best ramen in town. They get good food and a sense of community at this place. The owners are kind and amazing. If your in the area stop in you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great Ice Cream!  A long line when we were there, but they kept it moving, and in no time we were enjoying our unique flavors of ice cream.  We sat on the patio (there's no indoor seating).  It's a trendy sort of place.  We felt a little out of place with our 1 year old, but the ice cream was definitely good!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Awesome local ice cream spot!  FULL STORY: Stopped by with some friends right before close one night.  The owners were out chatting and greeting folks even though it was late -- they seemed to know all the neighbors coming in and were in no hurry to shoo anyone out.    Tried a few flavors -- they have some classics and some funky ones rotating through along with a couple vegan options.  Some were pretty mild (taro), and some were on the more sweet / strong side (almond) - definitely recommend tasting before you choose to find what you're into.  I personally loooved the black sesame flavor!  Look forward to coming back soon and trying more of their creations.  I wish you could see what's available each day on the site or something to know if your faves are in stock!   There are some outdoor picnic tables and lights strung up outside.  Shop is smaller on the inside. Cute setup, especially since it's in more of a residential area and open late (till 10) in the summer.  Note: They make their own cones!  Closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Wonderful.  Perfection.  Everything about Mason's Creamery is exactly what you want it to be.  The owners are the sweetest people, the ice cream is inventive and delicious, and the location couldn't be better (for me, at least.  I can literally see Mason's from my window).    They let you taste as many flavors as you want and are helpful if you are indecisive, like me.  Basically... go there now."}
{"text":"Ice cream is one of my favorite food groups. If you want to try some crazy awesome flavors of ice cream and sorbets, like taro, flan,  halva, Brie & jam... Mason's is the place to go. They let you sample any flavor and with all the interesting options, I feel like take advantage of this, you know, to make sure I make the right choice. They nail the flavors! The staff is friendly and down to earth which is a big bonus.   As I said, I love ice cream, you could give me a bucket of value vanilla and I'm happy camper... but Mason's ice creams are always a flavor adventure. However, the most impressive thing is Mason's events and philanthropy. They have ramen nights, show outdoor movies in the summer, and host fundraising events with corresponding flavors and unique eats (please bring back the choco-taco and PB whipped cream!!) I got my bike tuned up there for a donation to help a girl who got in a serious bike accident. All that is more impressive than anything I can shove in my mouth. I love supporting a local business, supporting great causes, and if I HAVE to eat ice cream in the process... I'll enjoy every bite!"}
{"text":"Delicious & healthy- not an impossible combo! Dairy based and vegan based ice creams with no artificial ingredients. The vegan ice cream is made from cashew milk which gives it a cream-y texture and mouth feel. It is much better than coconut milk which overpowers the ice cream flavor."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't reviewed Mason's yet; I must have been busy stuffing my face with endless scoops of their incredible ice cream! I was really excited to see someone taking over the old Ohio City Ice Cream spot and eagerly anticipated their opening. This place is dangerously close to my house and I now find myself there on a weekly basis. I used to be a die-hard Jeni's fan, but, if you can believe it, this is better (Yes, I said it, it's BETTER than Jeni's!). They do an excellent job of coming up with new flavors and constantly having new things to try.  I swear I taste at least 8 flavors every time I'm in there. They also have a few vegan flavors for those who are milk-averse in your life (or those who aren't, they're actually creamy unlike some of the other vegan ice creams I've tried). If the amazing ice cream isn't enough to keep you coming back Jesse and Helen are so friendly they make you feel like you belong there. My only complaint is that they're not open everyday but I guess they need some time to make more ice cream for me to eat (and I need to control my ice cream eating habits)."}
{"text":"Mason's is truly the real deal!  Some of the absolute best ice cream i've EVER tasted, in many countries!  Very unique, creative, homemade flavors made in small batches too.  Their ice cream is a 'labor of love', and you can taste that.  The Cleve Whiskey ice cream was absolutely phenomenal!  I hope they set up shop (in Fairview, Rocky River, N. Olmsted area please... I wish!) here on the West Side soon.  Their ice creame shoppe (notice the spelling of 'shoppe') would be a runaway hit!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge ice cream fan, but I must say I crave this place often! The ice cream flavors change constantly and they allow you to taste as many of them as you would like before you order. They make everything there fresh. The cookies and churros for ice cream sandwiches as well as the egg waffle cones, which is the most delicious way to enjoy ice cream. It's warm and flaky combined with the cold, sweet ice cream. We tried the baklava and strawberry and creme. The place is small and easy to pass if you're not looking, but look for it and check it out asap!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best places to get ice cream in Cleveland. They have many amazing flavor a like Vietnamese Coffee and also Nutella. One of my favorites is Popcorn ice cream. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, cookies, macarons, waffle cones...everything. Our new favorite ice cream spot"}
{"text":"What I love most about Mason's is every trip is a new adventure. The flavors change as much as the color changing spoons. I have my favorites but this one place where a  favorite is a one time try because they always have something new that sparks my interest. Everything is high quality and delicious and I have yet to feel underwhelmed by a flavor or a trip. This is my favorite lesser known place and I love bringing out of towners here."}
{"text":"One of the more charming destinations in Ohio City. You go to Mason's Creamery to be around friendly employees and uniquely plush ice cream and sorbet flavors. Taro, lychee, Rising Star, Nutella...all good. The place is also dog friendly! So much so that they'll even hook your pet up with some ice cream as well. The outdoor seating under the awning and the patio underneath the string lights only add to this already endearing handmade ice cream shop. Just go already!"}
{"text":"I said I'd be back! I now come here every time I'm in town to visit family. Best waffle cones I've had and excellent ice cream."}
{"text":"It has been more than a year since I left my original review (preserved below) for Mason's Creamery. If anything, I like Mason's more than ever. Here's a comprehensive review of my year with Mason's Creamery.   -- Short & Sweet:  These are good people who care about their community and who provide a unique and high quality product at a reasonable price. As long as they keep it up, I will continue doing my part by eating their delicious ice cream (and sporadic ramen.) It's a sacrifice, but someone has to do it. (PS they'll let you sample whatever you want, so be adventurous!) ---  Full Update:  Last year I tried at least a couple dozen new flavors, enjoyed many good conversations with friends on the benches outside, told everyone who would listen that they HAVE to try Mason's if they're true foodventurers, converted a few people to love Mason's as much as I do, and only missed one of their ramen events. This year, I expect more of the same.   What's so great? The ice cream, for one. Every single flavor I have tried - even the ones that weren't my cup of tea - were very high quality, excellent texture, and unique to Mason's. The prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly.   It gets better... in the last year, I have interacted with the Mason's crew on social media. The owner regularly praises his crew. He respects them, understands their value, and sees them as a family in some ways I think. I feel great supporting a business where employees are treated with kindness and respect.   These are good people who care about their community and who provide a unique and high quality product at a reasonable price. As long as they keep it up, I will continue doing my part by eating their delicious ice cream (and sporadic ramen.) It's a sacrifice, but someone has to do it.   My Original Review:  This is a local gem that should be on every Clevelander's (and every visitor's) list. I've been wanting to try it for a while... everything and more I hoped it would be.   They let us flavor anything we wanted.  Considering the unique flavors, that's a great policy. I settled on sweet potato marshmallow ice cream in a waffle cone (I swear it tastes JUST like it!) My wife got an affogato with white russian ice cream.   The staff was really friendly - no snobbery! They gave excellent customer service. It was a fun outing even though it was freezing outside."}
{"text":"Very yummy vegan ice creams. The moment you step into this place, it makes you feel that you have been time travelled to the 1950-1960 environment. Wonderful retro ambience and amazing flavors."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream place! They have new unique flavors each week, some of them I've seen include Butterbeer, Chocolate Frog, Thai Tea, Earl Grey, French Toast, etc etc. They also have churro ice cream sandwiches!! The ice cream tastes delicious. Really I don't know how to say it but it's so so worth it. The first time I tried it I went back twice within two days. The owners are super friendly, and let us sample every flavor they had, as well as sometimes the new flavors they're working on.  I think this is the best ice cream place I've ever been to"}
{"text":"One of my favorite ice cream places in Cleveland.  The flavors are so unique and rotate often.  They offer a decent selection of sorbet for those who are lactose intolerant.  There's a chalk board wall for previous flavors and they take flavor suggestions too!  The apple sorbet is SO spot on it's not even funny."}
{"text":"Probably should have updated this last year- but check out their storefront at 44th and Bridge Ave. It's such a cute location (the old Ohio City Ice Cream), and a great place to bring your dog or kids on a nice day, for some ice cream!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for ages. Finally made it out to this area while we were out here for lunch after Jack Flaps. Cute little store with cute dangling lights in the store. When we first arrived, the store was empty save for the two owners, who are super super nice, friendly and sweet people. They greeted us saying we can try whatever samples we wanted. How cool and inviting is that! So the five of us got to try all the flavors that intrigued us. I was sad that they didn't have the pawpaw flavor :(. Paw paw won't be out again until August or September. The flavors they did have: eggnog, salted caramel, blueberry, lemon cream, thai tea, vietnamese coffee, uganda vanilla, mango lime chili, taro and a couple more I don't remember. Scoops are 3.50$ for two in a small cup. Good portion size... bf and I shared a small and it was enough ice cream. Just enough for two. We settled on taro and thai tea flavor. Light ice cream and healthy tasting. Great service. They let us stay in the store for like two hours while we chatted away. Hope to come again in the spring and try their other rotating flavors!"}
{"text":"Very good ice cream, unique options, which I would love to see at more places.  The venue was not exactly what I was expecting, it's more of a walk-up dairy queen spot, they do have picnic tables for outdoor seating.  If only it were closer to our house we would be regulars."}
{"text":"I had such a great time here!!! The staff is so friendly (honestly like chatting with friends) and the whole place just exudes joy and warmth. They aren't just there to serve ice cream, but seem to really want to get to know their customers and what we want. They usually have a board up of flavor suggestions that customers can contribute to and they actually make it happen!  Mason's has so many unique ice cream flavors, as well as plenty of vegan options. I got the pineapple upside down cake (with pineapple chunks, YUM) and marzipan and it was DELICIOUS and creamy and smooth. They also gave us a complimentary egg waffle, and that with ice cream? AMAZING. Would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"I went here on a saturday evening since i was around this neighborhood. I heard good things about this place and was really excited to try it! The place was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. There weren't many ice-cream flavor options.They have unique ice-cream flavors such as vietnamese coffee, chocolate rosemary, taro, vegan peanut butter etc. I got a scoop of vietnamese coffee in a cone. The cone itself wasn't stale but it didn't taste fresh. For the ice-cream itself I have had other ice-cream which tasted better. The price is very reasonable, the location is nice, but I'm not a fan of their ice-cream."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, tasted great and they had vegan options!  Stop being a little bitch by eating dead animals who have been abused, go vegan!"}
{"text":"This is really a wonderful place with everything you could hope for in a neighborhood establishment.  While it is a small site, the hearts of the owners and staff are quite large!   I am especially appreciative of the creative vegan flavors and of how much trouble they go to in order to use local foods.  It's also nice that even with the smallest selection they will put a couple of flavors together so you can have pretty much everything that interests you. They also use biodegradable materials and their tasting spoons are real spoons and not plastic!  Bravo Helen & Jesse for bringing Mason's Creamery to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Mason's Creamery is ice cream for people with distinguished palettes and adventurous eating habits. I was hanging out with my mama at the Tremont Arts Festival yesterday. It was a little chilly out which was perfect weather for a hangover. I saw the Mason's Creamery stand and figured this would be the perfect food for a hangover. The flavors at Mason's are imaginative and unique. I learned about a secret type of North American fruit called the Pawpaw. Mason's Creamery has Pawpaw ice cream! The Rising Star coffee flavored ice cream was excellent. The ice cream was flavorful without being loaded with sugar. They also have vegan flavors. Follow them on Twitter to see where they will be next. This is the best ice cream in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The best ice cream ever. If you get there make sure you get the egg waffle with your ice cream it is amazingly delicious. They also have ice cream for dogs"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of state and I'm so glad my friend suggested to go here!!   Ice cream: the selections were amazing and above all the flavors were so fresh and real. I'm so sick of watered-down flavors that only has hint of the flavor they claim to be. But this place they were full on! All the flavors were so amazing. Two thumbs up for mint chocolate which was THE most fresh mint flavored ice cream I've ever had and taro which was not some weird dyed color of purple but true color of taro. I mean all flavors were just pure amazing!   Service: oh my goodness. Where do I even begin with service. The workers were the nicest people I've met in Cleveland. Even on my first visit I could tell that they were very excited and proud of what they sell. When we explained we were from out of state they were like why settle, just try'em all! so we did!!   In summary, a MUST place to try when visiting Cleveland! Hands down :D"}
{"text":"Still the best ice cream shop in Ohio City!  Loving their ramen nites and their new flavors! Black Sesame, Flan, Marzipan and Key Lime Pie!"}
{"text":"Mason's Cremery is a cute little shop on the edge of Ohio City. Their customer service was great. As a first-timer, the sweet girl at the counter encouraged me to try all the flavors of ice cream and told me information about the establishment, which was cool.  The ice cream was just ok. Nothing super great and I would probably choose fro-yo over a scoop. The texture was good but after a bite the flavor was no longer exciting. I got the triple chocolate and the marshmallow rice krispie and they didn't live up to their names as much as I had hoped.   But I will most likely be back again. They change their flavors often and I could tell they had a unique flair. It's hard for a local ice cream shop to push through in a town with a Mitchell's but  I would choose Mason's."}
{"text":"My first visit to Mason's Creamery was last summer and I got the strawberries & cream and mango lassi and remember being underwhelmed after the hype I've heard about this place... But I've really grown to LOVE this little ice-cream shop. I think the best thing that Mason's has to offer is, unique flavors aside, the owners' (and staff's) dedication to trying new things, taking risks and truly interacting and investing in their community. They host movie nights, international pot lucks...  As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it might be a bit harder for creatures of habit who want to get the same thing every time, because you're never going to get that with Mason's! But for me, that's the best part. I'm always excited to hear what they have to offer which varies almost every day--just check Instagram! It's so much more than just ice-cream, some of the \"specials\" I've gotten in just less than a year of frequenting the place: apple cinnamon bread pudding with brown sugar whiskey ice-cream, shamrock shake, black soft serve, and their famous pop-up ramen!  Some of favorite flavors to date: black sesame, matcha, brownie batter, hawaiian sour plum, banana pudding... Also, don't leave without trying an egg waffle. The standard is an egg waffle with two scoops of ice-cream on it topped with whipped cream, but my favorite way to get it is just an egg waffle on its own and I rip each circle off and scoop a bit of ice-cream with it. That way no part of your waffle gets soggy!  So pleased to have this gem in my community!"}
{"text":"Mason is a great ice cream shop that has an ever changing menu. But, for people like me who like the same kind of ice cream, it is a little bit harder to get excited to go to Mason's compared to some other ice cream stores in the area. I find the ice cream a little bit to ice ish. For those who love to try different and unique flavors this is the place to be. I know recently they had a bacon flavored ice cream that a friend of mine loved.  The reason that I gave Mason's a higher rating than three stars is because of additional things that Mason's offers. For anyone who has a dog Mason's offers a free scope of ice cream for the dog. While I was house sitting for a friend I took their dog to Mason's twice. The dog was so excited that once he saw Mason's he started barking and dragging me to the store. Once we entered the employees were so nice and happy to see the dog enjoying ice cream. Mason's also offers outdoor movie nights during the summer. Recently, I was able to go watch Hocus Pocus with a group of friends. It was a nice alternative from going to the bars or staying home.  While Mason's may not wow me in the ice cream department I will continue to go back because Mason's is great for the community and really cares about they people they serve."}
{"text":"I do like their ice cream and flavors. I like their fun creations and new ideas that they try out!"}
{"text":"It has a small indoor space, but is ideal in the summer. It's a bit pricey, but the ice cream is delicious. It isn't as good as honey hut, but it's very high quality. The staff is friendly, and I definitely recommend trying a few flavors before deciding!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for Mason's Creamery brick and mortar to open all summer..Finally it is here! Had the pleasure of having Jesse serve us. We walked in and he pretty much had samples ready for us to try! He wanted us to try all off them haha and we pretty much did. I settled with the Toasted Sesame and Salted Caramel, which he recommended. It was very flavorful! I just want a gallon of the Toasted Sesame to take home! There were about 16 flavors i think may be more. Very unique flavors craft if you will. Earl Grey, Coconut Pandan. All were full flavored.  Limited seating inside. They do have outside seating with heaters, which they were more than accommodating to turn on. I will Definitely say that Ohio City is now an Ice Cream Battleground! Can't wait to go back. I will Definitely go out of my way to get Mason's."}
{"text":"Came after dinner in Ohio City on a Friday. Line was kind of long but it moved quickly.  The flavors in the case were interesting but none of them really struck my fancy. There were a bunch of flavors on the \"idea board\" that sounded awesome though, so maybe I just hit on an off night for me.  I ordered a churro ice cream sandwich with vanilla ice cream- except I asked for only 1 scoop of ice cream rather than 2 as I was kind of full from dinner.   The churro was very good. Warm and straight outta the fryer. The ice cream was, meh. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special either (for me). I've also sampled their ice cream a few other times at festivals etc. maybe its just not for me. But that's not to say that some of their flavors are very interesting and fun and coming here just to see what they have and if anything sounds good isn't a bad idea."}
{"text":"Ice cream sandwich from freshly made and warm churros. Lemon ricotta ice cream. So fresh so clean so good. Always wanted flavors at this place and great atmosphere in Ohio city"}
{"text":"Not a big place but doesn't need to be. The flavors are artisan and creative. Doesn't have the creamy texture of normal ice cream, but still tastes great. Just a few of the memorable flavors my friends and I have had: lucky charms, thai iced tea, black sesame, cinnamon toast, peach sorbet...All wonderful. Flavors vary all the time. Staff friendly. Lines can get like traffic though because everyone wants to taste everything."}
{"text":"It's taken me far too long to come here. It feels like just yesterday that I was frequenting Ohio City Ice Cream, which was housed in what is now home to Mason's Creamery. Mason's has improved upon it's predecessor by including indoor seating and a warm customer service environment. What really sets it apart though are the flavors. Mason's does a great job of coming up with very unique, interesting flavors that you can't find virtually anywhere else in the area. I sampled nearly everything on my first visit, and it was so hard to choose only a few! Each was very true to flavor of the intent, such as the taro, coconut pandan, strupel waffel, vietnamese iced coffee, and ginger beer. These are just a few of the ones that come to mind, but they are always inventing new flavors and welcome customer feedback on what to make. I really appreciated the friendly atmosphere, and although I will say it's not my top favorite ice cream in Ohio, it's still definitely a winner in terms of it's willingness to venture into new territory. At least give something new a try, you probably won't regret it!"}
