{"text":"Just delish. I look forward to babysitting my mom as she lives n the hood. Delicious falafel balls, yummy salad and great selection of pizza slices."}
{"text":"the falafel is fresh and the toppings are the best in the city....great bargain"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love thin pita bread? Isn't that why I ordered a pita? I'm not really a fan of King David's style. I work down the street and have only ate here once. I thought it was a bit too greasy for me... but I was also pretty thrown off by the bread..  Wasn't that cheap for falafel. I spent most of my time there being jealous of all the kids around me eating really good-looking pizza slices."}
{"text":"tastes great, service is pretty quick, decent seating space though it can fill quickly some nights. rather pricey, though"}
{"text":"This Toronto Area Chain has several locations. The one in Thornhill has the biggest seating area in my opinion.   This location even has flat screen TVs on which they play all Leafs games! They have a good beer and wine menu, too.  King David Pizza has the best menu of pizza I have ever seen. Since this is a COR Kosher Dairy Restaurant, they have created some very cleaver pizza toppings. Potato and olives one of my faves.   They also feature great wraps and salads. They have falafel on the menu, but this is a pizza place. Pizza is what they do best!"}
{"text":"I'm only knocking a star off for the high cost. It kind of expensive for a slice. $4+  One can get a whole medium pizza from Pizza Pizza for $4.99  However for the Best NY style pizza, King David has got everyone in the area beat!  Kosher pizza rules. The taste (love the tomato sauce), ingredients and care of preparation is apparent.  They also offer freshly baked bourekas, falafels, that look very appetizing. Can't wait to try them on future visits. Located across in the plaza North of Promenade Mall on Disera Dr."}
{"text":"Really terrible food. I felt like throwing up after eating their shawarma.   The server wiped his running nose on his hand, and then continued to make my brother his sandwich with his bare hands. Absolutely unacceptable.   The meat was really dry, probably because they take it off the rotisserie and then cook it again on the flat top for some reason.  Stay away. There are plenty of better kosher places, like Balli Lafa, Saluf or Dr. laffa where the food is actually edible!"}
{"text":"I just hate to be charged $3.50 on a cheese bureka without getting the cheese"}
{"text":"They have the best Falafal in the whole GTA and I mean it. Full of flavors and aroma."}
{"text":"One of the most kosher experiences you will have in this city- You walk in and the store splits in two!  One side is for meat- smoked meat sandwiches, chicken fingers and other items I forget to remember. They divide the meat items from the dairy items.  The other side of the store seemed to be mostly vegetarian options- where i ended up due to the fact i was in bit of a rush. I randomly stopped by to grab a slice of pizza only to find out that most items are veggie based. I was not disappointed-and thank my luck for this new experience.  Both the eggplant and spinach pizza was delicious. One is not thinking in the most healthiest fashion when considering pizza. However I was satisfied in all means. Hunger gone, well balanced meal and it tasted pretty great!  Thanks to the owner who gave us the complimentary falafels- He knew whats up. Those little fried up veggie balls were PROPER FAM!  liked it!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Some of the best pizza you'll get in Thornhill.  Place also feels like a homey spot to eat, that is to say, staff actually gas a personality.  I especially like their cheese pizza, no joke, I'm not big on the toppings, and they do it very well here.  9/10 any day"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. I had to wait to place my order since the server went on break. While I waited, I saw a fly land on the onions. I figure I'd ignore it and convince myself it never happened. During the next nine minutes I saw that fly land on a number of other toppings. Since the dish I was going to try would have required each of those toppings, I decided to just turn around and leave.  I wanted to give this place a one star since I the fly landing on each topping was unsanitary and the long break the server took wasn't very client friendly. In fairness I didn't try their food so I couldn't judge the most important part of this review. As far as customer service and cleanliness goes, this place gets two stars."}
{"text":"Why anyone who isn't forced to eat Kosher would go to this place; is beyond me! Had kosher guest staying over and ordered from this place. Tried 2 different types of pizza. They must use a special type of sauce and cheese. Something that has no flavour! Wow so tasteless. King David's makes Pizza Nova look like the finest restaurant in the world (in comparison). The tasteless pizza is topped off with shoddy service. I feel bad for the kosher people who have limited choice and forced to endure junk like this."}
{"text":"It really amazes me how the same ingredient, used in the same dish could turn out so differently.   In this case I'm referring to King David's eggplant pizza. So sought after and pliable a vegetable in term of its many uses that it's often referred to as the \"meat of the Mediterranean\".   Order it as a pizza slice and the featured ingredient is thinly cut along its whole length. Allowing the short stay in the pizza oven to roast it to a soft, slightly sweet and nearly creamy goodness. The slice is colourfully framed by red & yellow hot banana peppers and a single tomato. While the top is dusted with sesame seeds. The crust has just the right thickness and appropriate texture that yields a welcome crunch with every bite.   Now contrast that satisfying nosh by ordering it as a whole pie and you'll experience a real let down. For my large size pizza order the staff decided to take a short cut by slicing the eggplant thickly across its centre. A dumb move because it resulted in an undercooked, chewy and unpleasant topping which is the featured attraction.   Their inconsistency is the source of my ongoing frustration with King David Pizza. When they execute a dish right, like the eggplant pizza slice, it soars. However, when they falter on the execution and skimp on the quantity of ingredients it's maddening."}
{"text":"Great Kosher pizza. Tastes New York-style. Sad that for a well-reviewed place, it is small and not very ornate. Will definitely be back when I come back to this area of Toronto. I'm just glad that I stopped by after passing this place countless times."}
{"text":"This place is Kosher, which is why it is slightly more expensive for the pizza but if you've never tried Kosher pizza, you definitely should! It tastes completely different because they use a different cheese, sauce, dough...everything that makes a pizza, a pizza! I've only had slices of pizza and they are always COVERED in toppings, which even makes the slightly higher price more worth it. I like the olive slice personally. I even love the fact that they sprinkle sesame seeds on the crust (just the top part)... it gives it a different flavour and nice crunch (and I really like sesame seeds) It's around $4-$4.50 a slice and is very tasty I know they serve falaffel and I've actually heard very good things but have yet to try the falaffel."}
{"text":"Glatt Kosher meat restaurant, Israeli-style. Right next door to King David's dairy pizza place in Thornhill, opened about two months ago. While it may have the same menu as other recently opened middle-eastern meat grill/laffa restaurants in the area, this is definitely a more Israeli fast food-style place than the others, giving it a leg up as well on the food.  Meat flavoured quite nicely, toppings numerous and plentiful. Laffas are thinner so you get more filling per bite and are massive. Hummus plates feature not-the-freshest hummus but definitely freshly-made toppings and GARLIC.  Not gourmet, but definitely good."}
{"text":"There falafels are lit and the pizza is just bad.  I remember the pizza being really good back when i was in high school but now its just bland and not tasty."}
{"text":"How has no one Yelped King David yet? For a city that loves falafels it's a travesty that this place isn't well known.  First, it may be called King David Pizza but these guys are all about the falafels. If you eat a lot of falafels downtown you're probably used to a few pre-cooked falafel balls wrapped up in a paper thin pita with a measly amount of toppings and only a splash of sauce. A Kind David falafel is a completely different creation and well worth the trek to Lawrence and Bathurst.  To start, a King David falafel is a bursting-at-the-seams pocket rather than a roll. It's only fresh, fluffy pita here, none of that paper thin, stale garbage most places pass off. They fill the pocket with freshly made falafel balls, heaps of beautiful vegetables, and finish with tons delicious hummus, tahini, and hot sauce. These suckers are messy so stock up on napkins.  I think part of the difference with these falafels is that they are Israeli style while most falafel places in Toronto are Lebanese style. But don't quote me on that.  And, King David is no one trick pony, the pizza and burekas are solid as well."}
{"text":"Food | 4 out of 5 Value | 5 out of 5  Service | 3 out of 5 Location | 4 out of 5 ________________  A hidden gem in Thornhill for everyone that craves pizza (and who doesn't?)   King David's has various pizzas and also middle-eastern items, like shawarma. The pizzas are more of a thin-crust, which I am biased towards so thick crust lovers beware! The cheese pizza is delicious and perfectly cheesy without overdoing it on the ooey-gooeyness.   A slice of pizza starts at $3.50 and goes up to $5. The price is reasonable and the size of the slice is decent. I know that you can get a full sized medium pizza at other chains for ~$6 but King David's is a local small player and tastes much better than the typical chain pizza!   The service was a little disappointing. I walked in on a Monday at 12:15pm, which I would assume is typical lunch hour. However, there was no employee in sight at that time and there were just customers eating and waiting in line. I waited 15 minutes for the staff to come back to the front. If I hadn't been craving pizza for a few days, I would have left and went elsewhere!   The location is in the heart of Thornhill, right next to Promenade Mall and the main Thornhill Viva bus station. It is in a plaza with a ton of food options so definitely a competitive scene."}
