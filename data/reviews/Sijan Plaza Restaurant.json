{"text":"Great for a late night Caribbean style Chinese food. 
Portions are very large and will fill the hungriest of people. Recommend the Chicken Fried Rice - just yummy especially with some hot sauce."}
{"text":"The worse take out Chinese food I've ever had! The pineapple chicken was nicely disguised but underneath was full of fat bony parts and hardly any meat. 3 out of the 5 dishes I ordered were wrong. At least the egg rolls were edible! Won't be going back. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I usually get the Cantonese fried rice with chicken on top. Never disappoints. I've been coming here as long as I can remember. However there is a a girl I don't recognize working at the front who looks like she hates her life and gives horrible customer service. Ill continue to take my food to go from now on so she doesn't ruin my love affair with this place. Oh ps it looks like a hole in the wall but the food is delicious."}
