{"text":"Casual Columbian food. Had the lunch specialMorning, hope you slept well. Thank you for a great night. Would love to continue that. , garbanzo bean soup, beef and rice with small salad on plate. 
Tasted good and value priced. Items off menu were $11-14 a bit high I thought for here.
Worth a trip. Not expected in this strip mall."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! Had Mini Bandeja Paisa which I haven't seen one of these since I left NYC. Also empanadas are fresh & very good. Overall food was great waiter was very nice & even the owner came to our table to greet us & make sure everything was ok. I would've give 5 stars, but food took a little longer than usual. We are definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"The food is true Colombian and the taste is GREAT!!!
I definitely recommend Gil's Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like that Gil's puts a lot of effort in communicating the beauty of Colombian culture, especially to people who may not know much about Colombia. The service has always been very attentive when we ate here. Their empanadas are some of my favorites here in Charlotte (I think they're slightly bigger and little softer / fresher than other Colombian restaurants in the area).

More so than my wife, I tend to prefer Colombian coastal food. I tried their ceviche which was pretty good. There's really not many (or any?) places around Charlotte to find ceviche. So I was excited to find it here and not be disappointed! 

In the past I've had the fried mojarra and it was okay, but not spectacular. I think my favorite Colombian coastal dish here in Charlotte is still the sopa de mariscos from Los Paises. 

That being said, we like the atmosphere and ambient of Gil's, the food is generally good and authentic, and the people are very accommodating to us."}
{"text":"Been searching for an authentic Colombian restaurant with good food for a while! And guess what I found it...you have to come and try it! Almost everything that I have tried is really good! And seriously this place feels like a small house and the people are amazing wonderful customer service!"}

{"text":"Es un buen restaurante,me gusto la musica y el ambiente; me encantaron los individuales informativos de la cultura colombiana,este restaurante es ideal para almorzar casero Como en la tierrita."}
{"text":"The minute we walked in the server was very pleasant and attentive. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa, it was amazing, the portion was very generous, I had a beef empanada, it very delicious, I also had their  specially juice it was very good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The worse experience in a restaurant!  My wife ask for a plate that it was overcooked and salty. Told the owner and the plate was replaced with something different. And when the bill came was charge for the 2 plates!!. Never in my life heard of this before!  Poor customer service! !! Oh by the way food wasn't that great either! !"}
{"text":"Delicious empanadas! The best I've ever had. So crispy and fresh, amazing flavors, not overly spiced, just perfect. The green cilantro sauce was also delicious! I had the passion fruit/milk drink and enjoyed that as well. Staff was extremely nice and accommodating. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Charlotte! Atmosphere is just okay, but I wouldn't be coming here for that-the food and hospitable staff are the winners here :)"}
{"text":"Delicious first time visit! Empanadas were hot and tasty filled with beef and potato. The special was chicken soup but we were surprised by the enormous bowl with side salad, avocado and rice. Finished with a sweet tart passion fruit cake.  Owners were very friendly with helpful suggestions. Clean with simple decor. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The best Colombian food in Charlotte. From the empanadas to there soups are great i come here every weekend's with my kids and granddaughter."}
{"text":"Had the mini paisa, so delicious. The sauce on the sausage was amazing! We came in so close to the closing time and apologized but they were so nice and told us to take our time. We talked to the guy working and before we left he gave us some meringues as something sweet after dinner, so good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the first time and I was not disappointed. The food was delicious, the server was very attentive and helpful. I was very pleased with the large portions and the food was very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Excelent colombian food. Empanadas colombianas true to the flavor. Bandeja paisa great portion, flavor full. Small restaurant owned by a couple that always try to put on their best face. Definetly worth the try"}
{"text":"Super authentic Colombian, Mexican and Carribean food. In a world where everyone thinks they can make a \"street taco\" it is nice to find food that actually uses the right spices and people who know that you can't just toss a tortilla around anything and call it authentic latin food.

Nothing fancy or upscale, but if you are looking for \"Real\" latin food, this is a great place to find it. Take out is great from here too.

There are a million places like this back in my hometown (Los Angeles) but there aren't that many here in Charlotte - so i hope they stick around for a long time!

Try the Bandeja Paisa and the Aroz con leche to drink. :)"}
{"text":"The best Colombian food I've ever had, HANDS DOWN!!!  I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Non-descript, little family-owned restaurant in a strip mall.  Very friendly, courteous, and efficient staff.  I ordered chorizo and two eggs accompanied with lime wedges and arepa.  Colombian food is less spicy than other south-of-the-border fare, so the lime added a unique twist to the chorizo.  I really liked it.

Several items on the menu intrigue me, so I'm saving them for a return visit.  That won't take too long!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Been coming here for awhile and the food NEVER disappoints. Service is ALWAYS exceptionally good! Atmosphere is so welcoming. I recommend this place a million times over."}
{"text":"Eaten here for both lunch and carry out. Great tasting food, fast service and friendly staff. The empanadas have a perfectly crispy crust and hot steamy filling ( chicken or beef), every time. The Bandeja Paisa will be enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying nice people when you first walk in, very welcoming.  I ordered the Bandeja Paisa, a Bandeja mini and Tostones with chicken.  

Overall the food was good."}
{"text":"My bandeja paisa was everything I ever wanted and more. More than enough food at an affordable price. Very tasty as well and excellent customer service! Definitely will return again in the very near future. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love trying different types of food which is what drew my to Gil's Kitchen in the first place. I would say don't judge a book by its cover. From the outside it doesn't look like much and it's also in a strip mall which can be off putting. This place is FABULOUS and the food is AMAZING! I had some empanadas and the Bandaja Palsa. The staff was very attentive but not annoying and graciously answered my questions (my waitress even coached me on how to correctly pronounce my dish). My friends had the Mini Palsa and tacos. We all decided that Gil's Kitchen warranted a definite return visit!"}
{"text":"Best Colombian food in the Charlotte area. The owners are very hands on and very attentive. I usually go there for lunch. They have daily specials and it is a different dish every day. So make sure you ask them about the specials. If you want to try something more hearty and have a big appetite, I recommend the Bandeja Paisa. This is Colombia's national dish and they make it to perfection. The portion is very generous and will not disappoint you. 

This place is also good of you have a hangover. Gil's makes the BEST soups in town. As a matter a fact, they have articles from local newspaper hung around the restaurant. The articles praises the chef's (Gil's wife) cooking and soups. 

The atmosphere is very clean and inviting. You will listen to Colombian music in the background and enjoy lots of Colombian knickknacks hanging around the walls. They also have a flat screen that in always playing beIN Sports. Sit down and enjoy a soccer game while you enjoy their food.

I love this place and I highly recommend it to everyone! As a Colombian, I approve 100% and this is the closest that I get to my mom's cooking."}
{"text":"I've been to all the Colombian places in Charlotte and Gil's is hands down the best for food. It is tucked in an unsuspecting strip mall, but well worth the find.

Having been there twice, both times the food have been fantastic. It's not fine dining, but it is well done home cooking. The first time I had a Bandeja Paisa, pretty much the pad thai of the Colombian Paisa region. All the Charlotte Colombian restaurants serve Bandeja, but Gil's does it the best. The chicharrons are crisp, the beans are flavorful, the steak is tender, and the egg has a runny center. Everything is well seasoned and prepared with care.

The owner mentioned that on Saturdays their special is oxtail soup. Not the most usual finding, but compared to any bowl of Pho, this sounded like a great alternative. I went back the following Saturday and can only say how fantastic the soup tasted. Everything was prepared well. The oxtail was tender, the yuca and carrots were soft but not over-cooked, and the corn cob was buttery and aromatic. The broth was rich, which tasted like it took hours to make, and the hearty soup made for a meal. 

I also got the picada to see how it was prepared and it did not disappoint. Crisp chicharron bits, tasty sausages, flavorful starches (yuca and pearl potatoes), and home made arepa pieces.

Having tried the food on a two week vacation across Colombia, Gil's has been the closest thing to revisiting Colombia! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Gil's.  When we walked in the owner greeted us warmly and took the time to walk is through the menu and make some great recommendations. We enjoyed some of the natural fruit juices (I had guava in milk, yum! and my wife the guanabana). 
The beef and the chicken empanadas were super tasty. Lots of flavorful filling, and the sauce served with it complemented the dishes perfectly.
We wanted to try a lot of different things so we shared the picada which had morsels of plantains, sausages, chicharron, yucca, and grilled beef. Super flavorful.
For dessert we enjoyed a piece of passion fruit cake (torta de maracuyá). It was super moist and delicious.  Service was great and prices very reasonable.  We can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu.  
BTW the online menu is just a small sampling of what's in store."}
{"text":"The food is great! I'm Colombian myself and that's some good Colombian food. I just wish they had more baked goods such as Colombian breads"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here today. Driven by this strip mall a million times and never would have guessed we'd fine this hidden gem. But we did, thanks to Yelp! 
 The staff was very friendly, the place was clean and the food was great. Wish I would have taken a picture. But we demolished the meal. We had yuca, empanadas and a typical dish filled with rice, beans, sausage, pork, steak and an egg for good measure! We have been moaning all afternoon from being so full! Great place to eat and the prices were not bad."}
{"text":"Best colombian food in town!  The empanadas are th BEST! So delicious, and fresh! ... Don't know what to eat? Here you go, empanadas to start, bandeja paisa with a natural juice to drink, then empanadas to take home... You are welcome..."}
{"text":"By far some of the best Colombian food in Charlotte!  My wife & I have ordered food to go about 4 times so far.  Every time the food has been great!"}
{"text":"I loved the authentic menu they have. It let me decide what I wanted while browsing other options. Service was great. They were helpful when I couldn't pronounce things.  also, they give can soda, so if you like a lot of beverage with your meal you may want to order two. The quality of the food was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Colombian food, tastes just like back home. The service was awesome and everything is very reasonably priced. Would highly recommend and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to have lunch there by far the best colombian food! Best empanadas and Natural juices! And the service is awesome I just hope it stays like that! So far I love it!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. So so would be my review. The food was good but not really authentic. It didn't have the true bandeja paisa flavor. The beans long with the carne asada tasted more Mexican than Colombian. The pupusas that my daughter had where horrible do not order them. Service was good."}
