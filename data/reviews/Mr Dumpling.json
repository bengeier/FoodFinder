{"text":"Great food! Good prices, very friendly and quick service. :) we've been ordering from Mandarin and this is sooo much better - quality and price wise."}
{"text":"First time here. We were in the area visiting friends and stopped on our way home to North York. We had take out. It was the best Chinese food we have had in years. Dishes were full of meat. No salty taste. Just really good food! Chicken and zucchini, beef and broccoli, Cantonese chow mein and steamed dumplings were our top picks. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing we travel 30 minutes just to eat there Chinese food. We have been going there for 7 years now. Open concept cooking. And if you show up at the end of the night the place smells like bleach. Satisfying cleanliness"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this fast food Chinese restaurant for a few years now, when I'm in the mood to drive out of Aurora.( 10 minutes north). I've eaten in; small 4 tables only / they mainly do takeout. They have lunch specials for students in the area which is good if you're a high school student.unch time is hella busy with the students but that doesn't bother me just giving you a heads up. They also have lunch specials & dinner combos along with the usual Chinese food items most people are accustomed to-you know chicken balls etc. But what stands out for me is the menu items like \"Hunan style \" which is spicy. The deep fried crab-cream cheese dumplings are a delicious treat.  Today I had the pork Lo-mein -lunch special which comes with a choice of 2 Mini spring rolls or egg roll or 2 crab/cream cheese dumplings. I had the spring rolls. The noodles they used were shanghai noodles. The portion was good food was tasty fresh & hot. My mom had the Hunan beef with fried rice. Beef & vegetables were tender,tasty & fresh. The fried rice at this place is never my favourite; it's always a bit bland to me. But today I was disappointed to taste the rice was stale! Doesn't usually happen so I overlooked it & didn't bother to complain (maybe because I was enjoying my noodles so much ) my bad. Next time it better not happen tho / won't be as forgiving . I will leave them with a 4/5 stars based on my many takeout & eat in experiences in the past."}
{"text":"Clearly intended to be fastest food. Not posing as anything else.  I tried the new Chili Chicken on fried rice.  Mostly heat, and little flavor. The coating was pretty limp as well.  The included appetizer was a Crab Cheese dumpling that was about 99% cream cheese.  I could not find anything inside that resembled crab.  This is an ideal place for the local high school crowd, with economical meals for young, uneducated palettes.  I'll be heading back down to Richmond Hill for the real deal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at around 12:30. It wasn't busy so my order was taken right away. It's more like a take out restaurant (although there are a few tables to dine in) where you order, pay and then get your food; so I am assuming tipping isn't necessary. I was craving for Cantonese chow mein with really crispy noodles so I asked the chef to make my noodles extra crispy. When I got my noodles, there was too much sauce in the noodles. It sort of became noodle in soup. I wasn't impressed as I requested the noodles to be \"extra crispy\". With the ample amount of sauce, my noodles became too soggy. It was also a bit too salty to my liking. However, The price is pretty good for the amount of toppings (chicken) you get. I've tried better Cantonese chow mein so I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"We like their steamed veggies with shrimp.  Lots of healthy food with a few indulgences.  Best to do takeout or delivery"}
