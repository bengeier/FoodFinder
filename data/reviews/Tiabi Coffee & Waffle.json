{"text":"First time here and can't wait til I get my order!!!! Soo excited so far iced pistachio latte is bomb"}
{"text":"The guy forgot my drink. The food tasted oily. Value, quality and service can not compete with Dougie J's Cafe, not even close. Will NOT recommend this place. I am going back to Dougie J's ."}
{"text":"At first glance this place looks like any other privately owned coffee shop. When you walk in the mood is calm and relaxing. You're greeted with a smile and upon looking at the menu excitement builds as you can tell that this is no ordinary coffee shop. It becomes obvious that the proprietors Tiffany and Mae put a lot of effort into creating menu choices that are not only healthy, but delectable and unique. The coffee is wonderful and flavorful especially if one's tired of the over roasted bitterness of Starbucks and many others coffee. As far as the food goes I have trouble ordering anything other than either the hashtag breakfast sandwich or the mixed berry salad. My favorite smoothie would definitely have to be the kale champ as it is not too sweet and tastes incredible.  frequent this establishment as I feel others should as well. Oh yeah and if you're having a bad day you should pop in for an ice cream waffle. It makes everything better."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Tiabi Coffee & Waffles  to anyone that loves waffles , awesome coffee , great teas and is looking for vegan food in Las Vegas .. This is the only place to go !!!  They are super friendly , patient and fast service. I am always impress Thank You!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since the open in 2013 and it's stayed a favorite of mine. The staff is always friendly and before they expanded, it was the owners Tiffany and Mae working everyday and they would try to know everyone personally. The drinks and food are great but it's even better knowing you're supporting genuine people. 

If you're into coffee, they have some quality beans and drinks for you. If not there are smoothies and teas. Lots of veggie options for food, which is nice but they pretty much cater to any preference. They are from Guam, and I've found that islanders have a pallet that leans more towards sweet flavors, so expect that when ordering food lol. It's not a bad thing, you can definitely taste that a lot of their inspiration comes from their home. Food is made fresh and to order. 

Anyway, check this spot out and tip your baristas."}
{"text":"Honest opinion is that it's all right, nothing at all to rave about other then maybe the atmosphere of the place. 

The two sandwiches I tried was flat out BLAND, the waffle in itself was uninspired with no actual flavor. The break-the-fast was overwhelmed by the bacon, I could not taste the cheese or egg. And the other was completely forgettable, left a \"why\" in my mouth. Why did they add two together, it tasted gross. 

Maybe I'll come back and try to test out other products they sell, see if standalone items like waffles or coffee would be a reason to comeback. But don't let the hype fool you, it's a 2 Star at BEST. And that's because of how the atmosphere felt."}
{"text":"This place is great! My co-worker recommended it to me, I was kind of skeptical, because my friends had recommended this other place and I was very let down. But I went this morning with some friends. I ordered the churro waffle. SO GOOD! It tastes just like a churro, i got it with whipped cream on top with powdered sugar. My best friend got a west coast sandwich, with chicken ,tomato , avocado, bacon, and their own tiabi sauce. She let me try it and it was good. She loved it. My other friends got strawberry kisses waffle and banana waffle. We loved everything, and the workers were super friendly and nice. I had a great time. Great place to have some breakfast or even lunch. Will come back and keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful people and excellent food! The perfect option if you're looking for delicious & affordable brunch. I would recommend the west coast if you're looking for a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, has a great atmosphere and environment, the barista is friendly and thoughtful. There are cards at all of the tables and the barista will even play with you if they have a little bit of down time. I love local places and this place exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the hashtag waffle and could have had three more just to keep the taste in my mouth. The staff was also really nice and made recommendations for me when I couldn't decide what I wanted.  

The place was a little tucked away off Maryland parkway but when you find it, it's like finding one of Vegas's secret gems. It's is very well priced and the ambiance is really chill and inviting. 

I will defiantly be back and would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for half price tiabi food! Was confusing but thats groupons fault. AMAZING food! I got the hashtag breakfast sandwich and strawberry sunrise smoothie. Def worth going off the beaten path to eat here :)))))"}
{"text":"Delicious food and they actually have good vegan options too! The Frankenstein signature drink was the best!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary. Small place with a lot of charm and outdoor seating. Absolutely loved the Tiff waffle macchiato"}
{"text":"The photo says it all, my kids would say \"yummy in my tummy\" lol great waffle sandwich, great blendie and amazing coconut iced coffee... thumbs up, next time in Vegas will definitely come back! Menu is simple but very yummy. Price is awesome best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"A pleasure to rest, drink, and study at! Staff is friendly and kind, coffee is strong and good, and the waffles taste like how waffles should: a delight. Music is not at all loud which is also appreciated. They've done a good job with this place."}
{"text":"This is great. There are really good gluten free waffles if you have an allergy for gluten. I love it and you should to so go check it out."}
{"text":"I was craving waffles while on my vacation in Vegas, and this place did not disappoint! Reasonable prices, welcoming staff, delicious food and drinks. The maple bacon waffle was great!"}
{"text":"Food and coffee both amazing! Staff super friendly and helpful, we will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"The food and service here is really good. The only reason I took away a star is because there is limited seating space."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this cafe once I saw that they had waffle sandwiches because I LOVE Bruxie's waffle sandwiches, but they don't have one in Vegas. Tiabi gives you the option of the classic waffle (thin, round waffle) or a Belgian waffle (thick, square waffle) for the sandwiches. The classic waffle reminded me of the one at Bruxie, but the quality and service were lacking. 

I ordered the West Coast sandwich and it was decent, but I felt like it was lacking flavor and thrown together a bit sloppily. I also got the red velvet wafflenut and it was super sweet, doughy, and just seemed like it wasn't fully cooked. There were only two people working, so it took us about ten minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get our food. For the amount of customers that were there, they definitely would benefit from having another employee. 

Overall, cute place, vegan friendly, but they just need to work on their consistency and their service."}
{"text":"Saw a Groupon for this place and was intrigued. I was surprised that after attending UNLV the past few semesters that I had never heard of this place from anyone since it's so close to campus. It's a a whole in the wall with wonderful charm. I really love that there are decks of playing cards at every table and board games to play if you so desire.

Now for the food, my boyfriend and I asked for the cashier's opinion about what was popular and we went with four of her top recommendations. Both she and the guy in the back were super nice and helpful. I ordered the Kale Champ and one of the waffle sandwiches. My boyfriend got a hot caramel coffee (which they brought him a cold version instead of the hot he ordered, but he enjoyed it) and the Elvis banana peanut butter bacon waffles (Seriously amazing, the crispy bacon worked so well with the all the other ingredients, a must have). Everything was really delicious and despite the small mix-up we'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Small biz coffee shop in a strip mall that tries hard but falls short on quality and style. The coffee was fresh brewed and good, waffles made fresh are a plus too but my breakfast sandwich had that \"instant\" egg square and bacon slices. 

The decor needs to come together a bit but overall it fits the eclectic college clientele of the area."}
{"text":"You had me at vegan baffles and almond milk. nom nom nom. Two things which are very hard to find, especially in Vegas. The boyfriend got The Hof (he's the carnivore) which was this pretzel bun with roast beef, arugula, cheese and agave-mustard sauce and loved it. I had two vegan waffles with macadamia nuts and strawberries with an almond milk latte. I also got the kale salad to go and it was really good. Not too heavy on the dressing. Just perfect.
Really cute spot. Not the same boring menu you see everywhere. Very attentive service, good prices. Really happy I found this spot. Taste buds happy :)"}
{"text":"Decided to get the groupon and try this place out and it did not disappoint! Cody got the break the fast waffles and of course I opted out for something sweet, Banana Nutella waffles! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Had the west coast waffwich and it wasn't what I expected. It exceeded it! Great job guys. Def be back."}
{"text":"Vegan waffles are hard to come by, especially at these prices. The coffee was so good. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Eggs tasted like they were pre-frozen. Turkey sausage was cold, and inedible. Cappuccino was it's only saving grace. No need for apologize, or ask me to come be and revisit and give you a second chance. Sometimes in life you have one shot, so make sure each meal you prepare is a make or break. Save the long reply and just put your words into actions."}
{"text":"A good quick quiet brunch stop. Clean, soft good tunes, a gathering place with cards on the table. Simple tasty waffles. Coffee better than Starbucks - and I'm not saying their coffee is bad."}
{"text":"Great waffles and coffee specialties. Nice atmosphere and very friendly service! 
We came here on a Tuesday morning and it was not crowded at all so we could order right away. 
We had the banana waffles and the one with strawberries. Both were really nice. The latte and the cappuccino were very nice, too. 
I can definitely recommend this place if you like a sweet breakfast!"}
{"text":"It was great!!! Very accommodating to my vegan needs!! And my boyfriends non vegan needs! :) it's a shame it's so far away from me and not in the greatest part of town! But don't let that scare you away! It was top notch quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"Had what I honestly consider to be the best waffle I've ever tasted in my life. Bacon, egg, and cheese on a crisp, soft-centered, golden brown waffle with Siracha sauce and maple syrup so good it probably just came from Mayor Rob Ford's favorite Canadian Maple tree. So good I'm just going to crush some work and stick around for lunch too (apparently they do burgers and sandwiches on waffles too?) Check this place out if you're in town. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Me and my mans decided to stop and try this place before heading home from our little Las Vegas trip, and it was a great decision! The employees are super friendly, the sandwich we had was the \"West Coast\", and it was really good on the ciabatta roll. For dessert we got the \"Bananatella\" waffle and that was delicious as well. It's a cute little place for some lunch or small dessert. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Been a regular for a couple months because of the great team that runs this place, along with the fresh quality of ingredients they use! Always a pleasure to come here! I usually get the West Coast sandwich! Comes on a waffle or ciabbata"}
{"text":"Mmmmm some of the best sweet and savory waffles I've had. Very light and fluffy. Awesome cappucino. Wish they had fresh eggs though."}
{"text":"Very cool local business. Excellent customer service and a great menu. Places like this make my mornings happy :)

Excellent prices, fun ambiance, healthy menu options, and super chill staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today. The waffles are fresh and delicious. I tried the Bananatella. It is two square belgian waffles topped with whipped cream, sliced almonds, and Nutella. The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

I am taking off two stars because the interior is unappealing. The decoration does not look good, the paint color is unappealing, the furniture is mismatched, the table looks old and dirty (even though it was clean). 

Overall, love the food and dislike the atmosphere/interior decoration."}
{"text":"This place instantly reminded me of one of those like little coffee joints that you find in like Seattle or New York! I had actually been looking for a place like this for a while!! The atmosphere is amazing but not only that! The food is amazing as well! Good portions for what you pay and the mocha is amazing!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I got hashtag breakfast sandwich with snickers ice coffee. Everything had great flavor cookies fresh. Boyfriend got red velvet waffles and he said it tasted great. Smoothies were also a hit!"}
{"text":"Service is horrendous and wait time is ridiculous! AR order time, told it would be about 20 minutes,  ok. After waiting 30 minutes I got up and asked how much longer, surprise, they didn't put in my order. Girl next to me got wrong item and had to get a refund then refund wasn't right amount and had to go back to cashier to correct. People on other side of me were halfway through their meal and still hadn't received their drinks, they had to go ask for them.

Waffle itself was great tasting but insides were skimpy, like they just tossed a handful of items on it and sent it out since they knew they made a mistake. I never did receive my kettle chips. :-( bottom line is, don't bother."}
{"text":"Literally sweetest group of people. The owners are very friendly with genuine, great hospitality. The food was AMAZING and extremely affordable. One of those hidden gems in town."}
{"text":"Once I heard about a waffle bar in Vegas, I knew I had to try it, but unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with my experience here. I arrived at eleven with a party of six, and another decently sized party had just arrived a little earlier too. We ordered, and waited such a long time for our food. There were only two employees working there, and we understood how difficult it must be preparing for two medium sized tables, but the thirty minute wait for our food was just too long, and that ultimately contributed to my three-star review. :( 

On the other hand, I'd give the food a four. I split a West Coast and South American. I'd highly recommend the classic waffle with sandwiches instead of the Belgian! They ran out of ham for the South American, but they compensated it with bacon and chicken; it basically became another West Coast though. Our party also checked into Yelp, and received the wafflenut. I tried the white chocolate macadamia, and although it wasn't exceptional, it was still delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Really chill place with breakfast options. Getting the iced coffee and Waffeldilla. Super clean place. Friends love this it too. Free water"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of discovering this place on Groupon as something new to try while visiting Las Vegas. The deal was for 3 - $8 vouchers to be used by 1 person with only 1 voucher per visit. Understood. So I go over from the Strip and plan to order and leave then come right back; then I was going to come back again before leaving town. Well I get there and they tell me I can't leave and come right back because it has to be on a different day or at least a few hours later. I tell them that is not ideal because it's a $40 taxi ride roundtrip from the Strip, plus that is not what the fine print says. They tell me it's up to them to determine what qualifies as a visit. I tell them that needed to be included in the fine print since they want to stick to the fine print. They said it's their decision and I can't leave and come back within a certain time period. ((So if I order something and decided it was really good and want another one, I have to wait a few hours before I can come get another one with my Groupon. Foolishness)) At that point I didn't want any of the food because the poor customer service and the bad attitudes of the employees made me lose my appetite. So I can't comment on how it tastes. But as far as the customer service and employees' personalities are concerned, they left much to be desired. If you don't mind crappy service then go for it. But if pleasant service is an important facet of your dining experience, then don't waste your time."}
{"text":"So happy they opened a location here. Their menu is so refreshing to see in a time when menu's have become mundane. I'm still exploring but so far the bananatella is the most delicious. Imagine if you will a waffle with the perfect amount of banana slices laid on top with almonds and Nutella drizzled all over the place! Its a great treat. The service at this location is excellent which I was so happy to see as they just opened. Servers have a lot of energy and are always smiling. Anyway, Tiabi Coffee & Waffle is perfect for the center and the surrounding neighborhood. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a new coffee shop type place to go to and we came across this little joint. It's very hidden, in the ghetto. It's on Maryland and flamingo in the target shopping center. We walk in, there's no where really to sit. It's a very cute shop but really small. Super clean. Everything on the menu sounded sooo good. I literally couldn't decide for like 15 minutes lol. The service was great. I got a waffle and coffee, and my total came out to like 14 bucks! I was so confused. I could've gotten Starbucks and a Belgium waffle from Egg Works for less than that. Definitely not worth that much money. I would go there more often if it wasn't so expensive and in the hood of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Get the hell off of the strip & check out the bomb food places around Vegas and Henderson. This place has good prices, good portions, a comfortable feel, & good people working the shop. It puts all that mega-hyped bourgie trash on the strip to shame. Fuck all that noise. Come here, get a westcoast waffle sammich, get some coffee, get happy."}
{"text":"Loved the food, coffee, and the service. Vegan and Gluten Free dedicated waffle makers are a welcome sight."}
{"text":"this place is delicious! it lets you get your cup of Joe and a little more!
the customer service is great!! they're all so nice! The ambiance is relaxing and you can just sit around and read your favorite book :)"}
{"text":"I had the banananutella waffle with a side of fruit and it was light tasting, not too sweet, yummy! The cup of fruit was a pretty good size for $1. Next time I'll try a smoothie."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fantastic service, really good food and drinks! My best friend and I were visiting from out of town and stopped by this awesome little spot. We are both vegetarians so it was perfect for us. Take the time to check it out!"}
{"text":"Place appears to have BOMB food options! Especially for Gluten free intolerances. Multiple waffle and coffee options, great for kids as well. They even have an array of shakes, and desert type waffles as well. Really unique teas, as well as cheap coffee choices."}
{"text":"Very lit, very tasty. Got the sandwich. It was gr8. Good drinks 10/10"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I got one of their savory waffle sandwiches for a coworker and I, as well as a custom sweet one for myself later. Both were delicious, albeit a little expensive considering the size of either. I can't imagine it's that pricey to make a simple waffle and add toppings :P But, it was still fairly good. I come by here now every once in a while to pick up a coconut truffle latte, as those prove to be a good-quality pick me up. The vegan kale cookies are a little different and a tad dry, but not at all bad (: Overall a cool place, the environment is welcoming but not quite as intimidating as, say Lestat's in SD, where you're surrounded by professional artwork and tattooed baddies. A solid 4  for customer service, drink quality, and surroundings c:"}
{"text":"Really really good! They definitely should put more chicken on the wafflewhiches though. I indeed recommend the Waffle Macciato or whatever they call it, it's killer!"}
{"text":"I got waaaay too excited at the thought of a waffle bar, but my wafflewich ended up just being decent. Swapping bread out with Tiabi's waffles didn't really change the overall taste of my breakfast sandwich, which contained eggs, sausage, and cheese. Their waffles aren't very flavorsome alone. I doused my order with srircha. 

Despite my table's seemingly simple wafflewich orders, we were left waiting for our food for an unreasonably long time period. There were only two people working in the shop, sharing the responsibilities of taking orders, preparing and carrying out the food, and attending to guests. Needless to say, the service was definitely lacking. One of the owners actually asked my friend and I to wait before ordering, but she completely left us hanging. There was a moderate amount of people in the shop, but it wasn't terribly busy. 

By the end, I don't think anybody in my party was super impressed with their wafflewich nor their wafflnuts, which tasted super doughy and undercooked. However, all of our meals were savory. Tiabi's sweeter breakfast choices might be a better option when ordering."}
{"text":"Spent a day doing my homework here and really got thing a done! Quiet place to study on weekends. Loved the Waffle with strawberries!"}
{"text":"Avocado smoothies and awesome waffle sandwiches. Vegan friendly and the food was delicious. Small hole in the wall type place."}
{"text":"Nice service and nice tasting food but not all ingredients are fresh. Not sure about the waffle mix but my sausage, egg, and cheese waffle had a perfectly round egg that looked like the ones that come in the frozen breakfast aisle at your local grocery store. For the price I was expecting a more \"home made\" taste rather than fast food. In the end, I will probably go back again though if I find myself on Maryland Avenue (#DMVnative)."}
{"text":"I went in a few days ago and the place was really cute and clean. When i wen to order i was attended by Gabriela. She was very helpful since I was so indecisive when it came to figuring out what i wanted to order, so she made the process a whole lot easier. overall excellent customer service, will be returning much more often."}
{"text":"Cute little waffle shop.  They have a big variety of toppings for waffles.  I got the elvis which had bananas, peanut butter and honey - delicious!  

On another occasion I got a green smoothie that I was a little disappointed by.  The ingredients were not blended until smooth so there was just too much texture.  Aside from that, the flavor was good."}
{"text":"The best waffle combinations ever! Can't believe I haven't heard about this place sooner. Great service and loved the oldies playing in the background. Definitely recommend to anyone , and all my friends and family"}
{"text":"A coffee shop is exactly what was needed in this neighborhood.  And I'm thrilled it's an independent coffee shop.  Love the ambiance and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegan waffle sandwich and Las Elvis vegan style. The coconut \"bacon\" was a very nice touch added on top of the agave, peanut butter and bananas. The waffle sandwich was the perfect amount of savory. Very good! Great coffee too! Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"For a small shop they have a big menu. Friendly service and prices are typical not exhortant. Vegan options (if your into that) gluten-free too (also if your into that)"}
{"text":"I was SO happy to finally see a coffee shop besides Starbucks pop up in my neighborhood. My sister and I stopped in one lazy Sunday to check it out. I had an ices pistachio latte. It was creamy, flavorful, not too sweet, with just the right amount of espresso. My sister had the iced lavender latte which was delicious as well. I've come back since and had the pistachio latte again and it has been consistent. I did try the waffle machiatto and it was awesome with the fresh, hot mini waffle served on the side. This place is worth checking out. Support small business!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great Belgian waffles , must visit especially if you are  Vegan."}
{"text":"This place was very chill, reminded me of the places they have in San Jose. I ordered the Bananatella waffle, and an iced honey cream latte which was ON POINT! The waffle is very filling, and of course Nutella makes everything better! I will definitely come back for the coffee though, as that was my favorite"}
{"text":"The food was great. But had to knock off a star for the service. Maybe could use another personnel be out on the floor to clean up especially on weekends. I mean why give the customer a wash cloth to clean the table themselves. Other than that it's a must to go try out the food."}
{"text":"Small interior. Otherwise this place is fantastic. My favorite is the West Coast \"Wafflewich\" it has such a wonderful savory flavor that I just can't get enough of. Good portion size. I even tried one of their vegan muffins. Now I love my bread and sweets; I am not a vegan, but they looked so delicious I had to try one. So yummy. I don't think vegan has ever tasted so delic!

Gotta try this place out! Lots of breakfast, lunch, and desert waffle choices. As well as coffees of all kinds and smoothies."}
{"text":"Their Waffle Carmel Macchiato, Bacon infused waffle and red velvet waffle sticks are TO DIE FOR! This place has it all and they are close to the strip and convention center for quick made to order catering needs!"}
{"text":"Incredibly good. So good. My avocado was a little hard. It that couldn't overcome the rest of what was going on with that waffle sandwich. My new favorite place in Vegas. No Smoke. Woot woot. Had a Red Bull Apple Cider. Shazam!!!  Order it."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop off the strip.  Coffee was good and the waffles were nice and crispy.  We ordered the waffle macchiato, tuxedo frapp and the Thai chicken waffle sandwich."}
{"text":"We found this little breakfast/lunch/vegan place a month or so ago and it original a delicious.  The Viva las Elvis is great and you can get it gluten free or vegan.  Today I tried the Waffledilla and that's my new favorite sandwich, with the sweet fluffy waffle and savory inside it hits the spot!  Love the trendy coffeehouse atmosphere, music and friendly staff. I would give 4 and a half stars if I could.  After more perfect visits I will give them 5!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, love the smoothies! and the breakfast waffles are great but the best part is you can customize anything and that's really helpful if you are on a certain diet. The staff is super cool and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious! We tried the breakfast sandwich, West coast, and smores and all were great! We even went back for another breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"I ordered the west coat which was actually very good the only problem was the waiting it took over 30 minutes to make my sandwich which was a little upsetting since they said it would only be 15 minutes. Friendly customer service maybe they were short staffed ? Because the resteraunt wasn't very busy. the sandwich was ok too me I think bruxxi on the Las Vegas strip is better. The waffle isn't as crisply as I would like it's more of a regular house type waffle which is still very delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! We usually come here every weekend. The west coast is delicious and I love their seasonal drink menu. It gives you more options to choose from and they are always good! The service is always awesome even when they are busy. Wish they were still open late though."}
{"text":"Some of the best waffles I have ever had. My friend and I ordered the vegan waffle sandwich and it was delicious! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place! It's located in a strip mall near Target! It's small but the service was good and the employees very friendly! I ordered the Viva Las Elvis, which is a waffle with bananas, peanut butter and honey, with bacon cooked into the waffle! It was very tasty! I definitely recommend this place, great taste and fresh ingredients, and a nice change of pace from the pricy strip coffee shops and the waffles are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Their Waffledilla with avocado was delicious!  My family thoroughly enjoyed their waffle sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"Even worse, the response tries to make me wrong! I'm the paying customer, hello! I'll take my money elsewhere. I feel personally insulted. Awful customer service."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a light breakfast based on other Yelp reviews one morning in Vegas.  Split the Western waffle sandwich with a friend and soon wished i ordered a whole one for myself.  Delicious!  The iced coffee was good too (it was hot outside already).  Will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Tables are sticky from the syrup. Waffles are burned. Also, a nice lady came in when we were here and had a small cup in her hand. She asked for a little bit of ice. The woman working declined with a statement to the affect of \"we don't give things away for free, you have to buy something\". 100 degrees outside and you won't share a little ice. Not for me"}
{"text":"Tried out this new coffee/waffle place that opened up.  Well new to me.  It's a nice little place to go.  If you aren't watching calories or just got a sweet tooth then the red velvet waffle is delicious.   Also got a snickers iced coffee which was good too.  Will be back since the staff was very helpful since it was my first time.  Glad there is something other then Starbucks around here now."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a casual waffle meal with a type of coffee concoction that will satisfy your palate.  It took me a minute to think of that phrase :p . The waffles are a perfect blend of crisp and soft with interesting and creative varieties that will have you coming back. They offer gluten free on certain menu items so be sure to ask. The coffee drinks look tasty but they are definitely cheat meal status.  Luckily it was mine today hence the banana/Nutella waffle, the pizza tasting waffle and the bacon and eggs sandwich waffle.  Shared amongst two adults and a toddler,  of course. Not to mention the two kale chocolate chip cookies,  two July 4th inspired sugar type cookies, blueberry muffin and an all vegan mini Nutella cake type thingy.  Did I mention it was my cheat day? It was all delicious. The staff were super friendly and answered all of my questions. It's nice to see good customer service.  I'll definitely be back but right now,  it's leg day."}
{"text":"I wwnt in today for the first time.  The coffe was well made and delicious.  The manager was very friendly and even made me try one of the waffles, which was fantastic.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Waffles. I frequently make them at home and stumbled upon this place and love Theirs too. I tried the Peachy Peach Ice tea on the first visit with a waffle. It was delish! I then come in for an iced-coffee it was good as well. The service was fast and price is affordable.  I will become a regular in their cafe."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! Gross waffles, I am assuming someone screwed up the waffle mix recipe that morning because if that's how the waffles taste everyday I'm truly surprised that place hasn't gone out of business yet. 
The waffles just had a weird texture and an off taste. They just did not taste right. We also ordered a \"hot\" coffee but it was cold, probably had been sitting out all day. If you serve nothing but coffee and waffles you better have fresh brewed hot coffee and decent waffles but they couldn't even get that right. 
Worse than the sub par food was the service, when the server came to check on us and asked how the food was I told him it was not very good and he just said \"okay\" and avoided eye contact and walked away! Wth!!! What kind of service is that?! No apology, he wasn't even interested in asking why I didn't like the food for the sake of feedback. He did not offer to call a manager over, just said \"okay\" and left... That is NOT OKAY!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. They make an amazing cappuccino, great shakes, and I love the 'kisses'  regular styled waffles. So good. Haven't had a bad tome here yet, so glad I found a great coffee shop, way better then any big time coffee shops."}
{"text":"I was looking for something breakfast-y, about 1230 PM on Sunday. I had seen this place since I live in ghetto area around here--it's in the Target shopping center. I dropped in and it smelled great.
I'll admit I'm not a big fan of waffles (prefer eggs/hashbrowns kind of breakfast) but the menu of waffles looked interesting.
I tried the waffle with bacon inside. When the server was getting it ready, she asked me if I wanted butter and I said no, which was okay. 
At any rate, waffle was good, bacon was crisp and I switched out the sugar free syrup for real stuff. The downside was that sadly, I was still sort of hungry but decided not to order another one :) Price is reasonable.
I don't do coffee, so I can't speak to any those offerings.
I'll go back and try it again sometime."}
{"text":"I know I'm in the minority but the food here is just ok. I actually left feeling sick to my stomach, this is just before heading to work so I'm not happy right now. I was beyond excited to try this place and went out of my way to come. 

I had the west coast and the honey espresso coffee. 
The girl at the counter was very nice and everything came out super fast... but it was not busy at the time. As soon as my sandwich/waffle was ready I dug right in but it was already soggy and just fell apart. Kinda disappointing but oh well, I managed with a fork and knife. The waffle was tasty on its own but together it did not jive with me.

Honey espresso was yummy, almost too sweet for my taste so likely wouldn't order again. But they have a lot to choose from. 

If I come back I'm just gonna stick to traditional waffle with minimal extras on top to play it safe."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Tiabi about 3 weeks ago and we have been there 4 times already!  We start with the starwberry sunrise and green nut drinks. We have tried almost allo of the sandwiches and they are great. Today we had the waffledilla and it was fantastic!  We love to eat on the patio which is dog friendly.   Great way to start the morning!"}
{"text":"Great place for waffles! The employee, Israel, great customer service and did an excellent job with mine and my girlfriends food!"}
{"text":"Good coffee.. the waffles and waffle sandwiches were under impressive, ambiance was fine nothing special"}
{"text":"Where do I even start? I've driven by this place a zillion times & never knew it was there. I'm so glad I found out about it. A bunch of us went one day for lunch & the ONLY unfortunate thing was that it was already crowded so we waited for our food for quite a while. But it was worth it & I can't wait to go back & try more items! I had the west coast wafflewich which was seriously delish. I tried a bite of a friend's waffledilla which was also yummy. The owner (?) brought out churronimos for the table due to our long wait & holy yum. Appreciated the acknowledgement & gesture. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I haven't tried the food but the coffee and service is on point! Great music and good vibes here. Perfect place to chill, read, or grab a coffee to go. They also introduced me to Epoxy. Buy 10 coffees get the 11th free!"}
{"text":"If you love waffles, you won't be disappointed. I was visiting Vegas for a week and just stumbled on Tiabi. It was so good, I returned twice. The breakfast sandwich is a standout. My one complaint is the time it takes to prepare your food - about 15-20 minutes - even though the restaurant had no more than four patrons on each of my visits. One person prepares the food and another your drink, and either one is also taking orders, all of which makes for slow service. So if you're in a hurry or just want to grab something for the road, it's probably not the best place to go. If you're not, it's worth the wait. I'll definitely return whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan waffles, I loved the guru burger. We were just driving BG through Vegas and had been looking for vegan waffles since we left Virginia. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here, and it won't be my last! We ordered the Vegan Wafflewich, Strawberry Kisses, Stiles Java Jolt iced and the Snickers Iced Coffee. 

I personally had the vegan wafflewich and it was absolutely delicious. I'm a sucker for anything even remotely resembling caprese, so I was all over this sandwich. And how can you go wrong when your bread base is a waffle? The waffle tasted super fresh and fluffy and really brought out the flavors of the dressing. I of course had to get the vegan mozzarella on it as well and it was great. It tasted exactly like traditional mozzarella, even the same texture. Very impressed with the wafflewich! I'm always so excited to see vegan food options. So I really appreciate this!

The strawberry kisses waffle I sampled from my mom was exactly what you'd expect from a waffle topped with strawberries, whipped cream and chocolate - DELICIOUS. 

I'm anxious to come back here and try some of the other menu options!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic shakes had another stores one today highly recommended a little pricy but premium shakes"}
{"text":"The waffles and coffee here are good. Honey in coffee? I know sounds weird, but it's good. Wish they had real eggs  though, they only have egg patties. The utensils could be cleaner, they had a lot of hard water spots that might bother some people."}
{"text":"I walk in and everyone is so upbeat in the morning which I miss. I've worked in customer service for too long, but I was greeted genuinely. I've never been here before up until recently and tried the churro iced coffee. Please keep it up. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"I really wish this place was close to me, as their vegan waffle selection and flavors are great!

Came here on the way to the airport upon leaving vacation, and it definitely did not disappoint. I had the viva las elvis vegan style, and an avocado smoothie, and my dining partner had one of their waffle breakfast sandwich concoctions. 

my waffle was very tasty. I wish I were eating one right now instead of writing this review. The smoothie was pretty good, probably wish I would've went with another smoothie as avocado smoothies are hit and miss to me (despite loving avocados). 

My dining partner still mentions how delicious her sandwich was and that she wished the place was closer, so there is that too! all and all, great all around!."}
{"text":"Creative Food.  DELICIOUS and the prices are fair.  The staff is extremely friendly.  I had Red Velvet Waffle."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. The staff was friendly and the food was great! The West Coast Waffle with an added egg was recommended by the registrar, and I'm glad she did. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great energy, good coffee, nice waffles and good people. Mae the co owner has a great energy"}
{"text":"Coffee is bomb, waffles are deliciously crispy yet soft ... The staff is cool also, this place is so unlike other coffee shops in Vegas in that it feels like Portland Oregon or San Fran!! I study and chill there !"}
{"text":"Gluten free batter that tastes incredible?  Yes! This place has wonderful waffles and you can get any made with aforementioned batter. I highly recommend the maple bacon waffle. Friendly staff and service. If you're lucky enough to live here in Las Vegas,  this is where you should be eating breakfast no less than every single day of the week. If you're just visiting and you want a vegas breakfast that isn't over priced and mediocre than come here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a amazing find!!! Found them in a deal on groupon! This will be a stop on everyone of our Vegas trips! They have incredible food and the service was fantastic. Told them I was lactose free and the made my coffee with soy for me and even gave me the vegan waffle on my sandwich since the other one has milk in it - so nice of them to care!! The food was so fresh - they made the waffle on the spot as you order! I had the west coast and my husband has the break the fast - both delicious! We will be back. Clean restaurant too! Thanks for the yummy food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"3 steps to having a happy day.Step 1 go to tiabi coffee and waffle place fpr breackfest.Step 2 eat tacos el gordo for lunch.Step 3 nap"}
{"text":"Recently hit up this ADORABLE spot on our recent trip to Vegas since we had a groupon and oh man was it worth the trip from the strip! 

The place itself is adorable and throughout my various trips to Vegas (yes, we explore off strip, weird I know), it seems like small local businesses just aren't as popular like here in Austin so I love to see that..but I digress. 

Onto the yummies: The hashtag breakfast sandwich was the shit. Not too heavy but totally delicious and filling! The waffle my fiancé had was outstanding! Forget what it was called but it had Nutella and pretty much blew my mind. 

The owners were there and we chit chatted and they were so nice!! Wonderful food, GREAT staff, and overall a much needed break from the Vegas strip. Can't wait to try it out again in April when we go back!"}
{"text":"very nice neighborhood place for a different kind of treats. Yes I'd return. There's an I Hop across the street, this is  better.  Although there is a smaller list to choose from. It's a lot of fantastic food here. Stop in you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was honestly the best sandwich I've had in a long time truly! Great location close to my house, thinking about going back for another one today!!"}
{"text":"Cozy, clean, coffee.....delicious and local. Waffles cooked to perfection. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's super good food honestly recommend the bannatella it's super good it's a waffle nutella drizzle almonds and whip cream and also looks super appetizing so is strawberry kisses"}
{"text":"Been here many times. I only order online cause it's easier to see my options and when I get there the wait is not long. I've ordered their smoothies, coffee, waffles, salad and from their lunch menus. I would drive 35 minutes almost every weekend just to come here. Great prices. Great staff. This is my Starbucks :)"}
{"text":"We had the red velvet and strawberry kisses waffles. They were both delicious! Tried the pistachio latte, it was divine. Prices are decent. Girl behind the counter was helpful with selections since it was our 1st time there. Will definitely visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"So my best friend and I are from Kansas City, and we were on a road trip with one of the stops being in Vegas.  We found this place on Groupon so we figured we might as well give it a try.   I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this place is!!  We absolutely loved it!!!!  Not only is the staff nice, but the food and drinks blew us away!  My friend and I traveled through 7 different states and ate at dozens of restaurants, and by far, this was our favorite place!  In fact, it was one of the highlights of our 14 day vacation, and we miss it already!  We will definitely be coming back here!!  :)"}
{"text":"WAFFLES. But with a twist. Tiabi Coffee & Waffle presents some of the lowest priced yet uniquely invented waffle creations in Las Vegas. Their menu boasts inventions like the Maple Bacon, in which they cook the waffle with bacon inside of it! Strawberry Kisses is one of their signature waffles with frosty white whipped cream on top of sliced strawberries topped with a chocolate drizzle. It's simple, it's delicious, it's unique, and I keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I like small businesses. I try to support them as much as I can. This place is small but they have outside seating they have about 4-5 tables but it's really tight in there. Wide selection of coffee drinks. I had a waffle sandwich ham, cheese and avocado. Pretty good a little expensive but I had a Groupon so it made up for it. It really like this place and I have several more Groupons for me to come back and try the other things on the menu. The staff is friendly but be forewarned; I came in on a busy morning and I had to wait 25 minutes for my coffee and sandwich order to go. Not their fault but it was a little annoying."}
{"text":"Stopped in thanks to other Yelp reviews looking for an afternoon snack and coffee during my travels.  I prefer to stop at local places wherever I go and this is a great spot!  

At the recommendation of the staff I had the \"west coast\" waffle and an iced \"Honey Cream Latte\".  Wow!  I got more than a snack... I'll be having a late dinner.  I loved the savory option that had bacon and avocado (my favs!) on a waffle with a little cheese and grilled chicken.  SO good! 

The drink was delicious as well, although I got it half sweet per my taste.  I didn't realize it was a breve (made with half and half instead of milk) but the treat was welcomed since it's so good :). 

Great little place away from the strip.  Good anytime of day - not just breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! As you walk in, the restaurant looks so cool the way they decorated. I love the chalk walls. Their menu is different from any ordinary waffle house. Their choices for waffles and drinks are really unique. I'm not a fan of waffles, but the B.A.T. Waffle Sandwich was so delicious. If you like iced teas, Just Peachy is perfection. Best of all, its located near UNLV. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their waffles, crunchy and light! We had a golden waffle with green tea ice cream and a West Coast Wafflesich, the food is clean and fresh. If you like something light and refreshing(more of a Japanese taste than American style), definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Very good food and coffee!!! The Viva Las Elvis (Vegan option) was excellent!! The staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Tasty waffles. The vibe is still being figured out but the variety of waffles and what you can put in or on them is good. A hip little trendy spot that offers coffee drinks and a variety of savory and sweet waffle options."}
{"text":"It is a good breakfast place with a lot of waffle options. I had a waffle burger which wasn't that great. My wife had a strawberry banana waffle and it was great. My guess is the sweet waffles are great - savory ones may be a miss here. They have some creative coffee options as well. A solid place to check out."}
{"text":"We randomly found this place on google and thought we'd give it a shot. We're always looking for local restaurants to try in Vegas and this one did not disappoint!! 

The staff is incredibly friendly and genuine. You can tell they at happy to serve you. They smile when they work and seems like they all love what they do, like it's more than just a job to them. They also take the time to get to know their customers. While we were there, they greeted multiple customers by name and had casual conversations with them.

There are a lot of options on the menu, for both drinks and food. We got the Viva Las Elvis (amazing), Tiff's Waffle Macchiato (amazing), Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich (good, but sausage seemed like it was a frozen patty), and Snickers Latte (good, not too chocolatey).
 
Overall, this place is a gem! We'll definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Cute place. Nice selection of waffles, waffle sandwiches and other items. Happy they have vegan options. The waffles were the perfect texture, light and crispy. The coffee was really good, too."}
{"text":"The West Coast I had was amazing!! Perfect meal to start the day, or the long drive back to Ontario.  Coffee was so good, some of the best I've had. This is definitely a must have next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I wish I found this place sooner! Excellent coffee, great food, friendly customer service and WAFFLES! What's not to love? I highly recommend the first signature coffee, Tiff's. Sooo good and comes with a small piece of waffle dipped in cinnamon and sugar on top that you can dip in the coffee for a savory treat. The lattes were also incredible, and every food item (breakfast & lunch) I have loved! Super conveniently located if you go to UNLV, literally down the street in the Target shopping center."}
{"text":"This is the best waffle place I've ever been to. They had sweet and savory waffles. I ordered the savory Thai basil a fb my husband ordered the guru burger. They were both phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! It wasn't crowded when we were there and the staff was so friendly. We ordered some coffee and got the \"Honey I'm home\". I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet breakfast."}
{"text":"Thank you for your cruelty free Vegan options!!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I am a huge fan of breakfast places in general.  I had read in the weekly that this place was pretty good and their menu looked amazing.  So for finals week we decided to treat ourselves.

My partner had the hashtag waffles with strawberries and I went with the bannarama waffles.  The counter lady was pretty nice at first but our order took soo long.  There only three people in the place!  I asked her what was going on and she got extremely rude and said they only had a few irons going and my order would be ready when it's ready.  Need to work on their customer service skills big time!

While we were waiting I ordered a strawberry kale smoothie and it was pretty good until I found some really large chunks of kale that were not blended well.  Tasted like a salad halfway through my drink...

We waited at least an hour before telling her we needed to leave because we were late to class.  She offered us a discount and we ended up getting our orders to go, but they were completely overcooked (big surprise) and the waffles were crispy and tasted like cardboard.  

In the end, the prices are good.  The food and service are not."}
{"text":"This is a very small shop mind you, and there are often only 2-3 people working here at a time. At least that's what I've seen when I go there. Only once have I seen it really busy. This little cafe serves waffles as sandwiches as well as teas. The teas can be taken out or have to drink inside in a big tea cup the size of a small soup bowl. 

When I went with my sister, she ordered a Kisses waffle (Strawberries, chocolate syrup, and whip cream) and I got the Toasty Tokyo Wafflewich (Chicken breast, tokyo dressing, spring mix and cheese). It took a while for the food to come out, which I can understand since only 1 person was working at the time. They have a deck of cards at each table to entertain the guests as we wait for our meal. 
The chocolate sauce dispenser broke and smothered the waffle in chocolate, but my sister was very happy about this since she loves chocolate. My wafflewich was very tasty.

However the cafe filled with the smell of smoke shortly after our our meals were given to us. So the door had to be propped open and let the cold air in."}
{"text":"We found this hidden gem on happy cow on our way back from Hoover Dam. Its in a small strip mall. We walked in to a fun and compfy shop. We were greeted with happy smile and very friendly service. We ordered the West Coast for me and the vegan Guru Burger for my boyfriend. Both were amazing and super tasty. We also split the Green Nut smoothie. I would tell everyone to come and try this gem whether your vegan or not, there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly service and unique dishes. This food is great, I will be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"They have great filling waffles! Their coffee is very good with some neat variety. We love coming here to grab some coffee and waffles. Cute and clean coffee shop. Sometimes the service is slow, but they take their time making great waffles."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a wide variety of waffles and speciality coffee. They even have red velvet waffles! And you can get it customized how you like. Staff very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee that isn't SB in Las Vegas!  (On another note I'm surprised Stumptown isn't that available around here...)
The service was great too, I especially like how most everything can be made vegan. I'll have to try the vegan waffles next time... they look yummy. Oh yeah, Pearl Jam in the background is a nice touch too:)"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place from a lot of UNLV students, so I had to check it out. I expected it to be just a waffle. While I really like waffles, I can also make them at home, so they are usually just okay, in my opinion.

I ordered the waffledilla sandwich without tiabi sauce. It was spectacular. The flavor of the waffle is off the charts. It had just the right about the sweetness, and the texture was a perfect balance of soft and crispy. The chicken was also moist, and I really enjoyed the whole thing. The chips are also pretty good too, which was unexpected as, again, they are just chips. 

Finally, for dessert I had the cinnamon sugar covered waffle with ice cream. It was really good. I surprisingly enjoyed my sandwich more, though, because the sandwich was more so something that I would not be able to replicate at home. 

Tiabi also frequently has living social or Groupon deals, so this place ends up being super, super cheap. 

I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Vegas and was craving for some waffles. A buddy and I decided to check out some waffle house with good rating and we decided to give this a go. And it was forsure a good pick. Food was great and the avocado smoothie was amazing! Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Oh Tiabi ... how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You are so incredibly delicious. I can't speak about 99% of their menu because I order a red velvet waffle with chocolate drizzle EVERY SINGLE TIME, but I just don't want to change it up. My sister loves that they have vegan options and are a typically go-to spot for us if we pick someone up at the airport in the morning."}
{"text":"An unexpected treasure. From the outside, I wouldn't have assumed such a delightful experience. I came to TIABI after purchasing a Groupon and assuming it was much closer to where I live. Though we drove 30 minutes to get to TIABI, it was worth it 100%. When you walk in, you're hit with a wall of delicious smells. Then choosing your meal is nearly impossible because EVERYTHING sounds incredible. I highly recommend any waffle with Nutella on it, as well as the Tiff's Waffle Macchiato. It's basically dessert for breakfast, in the best possible way. The service is fantastic. Come, enjoy the free wifi and delicious food, and then come back and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"The only negative I can think of is there's no storefront visible bike parking, though I can easily lean my bike and against the window and lock the tyre to prevent theft.  This place makes a bomb espresso for your training espresso shot. 

This is my favorite place to grab lunch or breakfast in Vegas.  I live within walking distance and go about 1-2 times a month.  The staff always remembers me and I don't even have to mention that I'm vegetarian since my first visit.  My favorite is the Viva Las Elvis, they make this awesome vegan bacon that is made from coconut flakes in place of all their regular bacon items.  Another favorite of mine is the Guru Burger.  They are happy to try new combinations too if you ask.

My roommate is a carnivore and we always go together.  He really enjoys their non-vegan options as well.

Edit/Disclaimer.  I work here now as of a month ago.  This review was prior to my employment."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles!! Great lunch special! 

This place is probably one of my favorite places to eat off the strip. For the afternoon special you get a small coffee and chips with the waffledilla. Amazing! The portion is pretty decent, but I liked it so much I had two. :D"}
{"text":"The service sucked and it took at least 30 minutes to just get our drinks. Not only that but the ice cream was freezer burned and they were literally out of EVERYTHING! doubt I'll be going back again"}
{"text":"We stopped by early in the morning on our way to the Grand Canyon, and the restaurant wasn't too busy. At the front desk, they displayed some of their deails, like 10% off for checking in on Yelp, and buy-one-get-one-free on their classic waffles.

The place itself was a good-size hipster cafe, and the employees were all very friendly. The only complaint I had was that the service took unusually long. Our smoothies and coffees came out relatively fast, but for the three waffles we ordered, we waited about 25 minutes. Luckily, they had a few deck of cards that you can play with to pass the time.

Aside from the wait, the food was really delicious. They had a good selection of waffle dishes, and there were a couple substitions that they make to cater to vegans. Overall, definitely recommend this place if you're looking for waffles."}
{"text":"West Coast waffle sandwhich. Nom nom. It was bomb. Tiabi is located across the street from Toys R Us. Definitely a place worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is new & can get pretty busy.... But the food is awesome & the employees are Great...."}
{"text":"Amazing hole in the wall restaurant! I love how amazingly friendly the staff is. We are always super satisfied when we come here. We loved it so much that we purchased a groupon for the whole week we were in town. Everything on the menu is to die for! My personal favorite was the west coast and the hey Arnold Palmer. I definitely recommend coming here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had such a great dining experience here! The food was awesome and service was excellent! We ordered the kisses, bananatella and break-the-fast waffles. The waffles were light and very flavorful! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the toppings were fresh and goes so perfect with each other. For drinks, we had the purple ube frozen frappe, dom's chocolate caramel frozen frappe and tiff's waffles hot machiatto. Each drink was unique and super yummy! (didn't drink them all by myself - shared them with friends) My fave would be the chocolate caramel! 
The ladies of the cafe were all so nice even though we used their livingsocial deal. They were also very accomodating to customers with kids. TWO THUMBS UP to TIABI!!"}
{"text":"Had probably the best waffle ever! Loved this place and the coffee was very tasty! Hubby had the waffle sandwich which was surprisingly great!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  We were looking for something with breakfast, good coffee, free wi-fi, and popular.  First time I've ever like a waffle sandwich; had the Hashtag breakfast sandwich w/cup of fresh fruit, it was really excellent.

This little place was a great find. Chill definitely come back, next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hmm where to start. This was my second visit here.  It's a lovely upbeat place with excellent customer service who doesn't give yú attitude when yú have a \"complicated order\".  We both ordered the Frankenstein thinking it was going to be a hot coffee.  Our cold frothy drinks were presented to us at the counter.  We didn't realize that a blend means it is blended with ice. We thought it was a blend of roasts.  We spoke to the nice gal behind the counter and she explained the differences to us.  My friend then ordered the Java Jolt (which is out of this world good).  The cashier brought out the J.J. when it was ready and wanted to make sure we were satisfied with our drinks.  We tried to pay for the third drink but she refused and said it was on them and apologized for the confusion.  We also asked for a low carb option, she said they could do a sandwich without the waffle, so we opted for that.  It came out perfect and the eggs even had the waffle iron griddle marks.  They have earned a spot on my list of local favorites to visit for Vegas.  Thanks again and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This place rocks! They are able to make almost anything gluten free. I had the maple bacon waffle with butter and powdered sugar. Boy, was I blown away! The waffle was amazing it had literal pieces of bacon in it. You would never even know it was gluten free. They have a BYOW (Build Your Own Waffle) There are tons of possibilities on this menu and I am excited to come back and try everything. 

The actual space was really cute. The walls had fun quotes and art. 

The service wasn't amazing but wasn't terrible, everyone working was nice and helpful.

Will definitely be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The only thing I'm not sure about the food was the TIABI sauce, which tasted a little funny, but overall I enjoyed the food. I asked a lady to take a few photos for us and she took quite a few! Very happy with this place. Can't wait to visit  again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and coffee. We were all happy about our selections - the waffles are way better than anticipated as part of a sandwich or a quesadilla. The food took longer than expected for a counter service restaurant, but it was delicious and creative."}
{"text":"We ordered the maple bacon waffle and the breakfast sandwich. The food was amazing!  The best waffles ever. I was so impressed. Great customer service and I didn't have to wait too long for my food. I wish there was a Tiabis is San Diego."}
{"text":"Such a cute and vibrant place. The service is so nice and fast! Not to mention how good the food is. It's my favorite place to go for sweets, coffee and a fun game of cards."}
{"text":"I always HAVE to stop here when in town! Delicious yummy, healthy food at a great price - you can't beat it! Highly reccomended especially to those with special diets like vegan/vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought having waffles as a sandwich and enjoying it with a nice cup of joe would taste so amazing. This adorable place is a central hit to all things waffle, latte, and coffee. Whether you like your waffles savory or sweet, they have something great for everyone. They have a Waffledilla, Guru Burger, Savory Thai Basil, and if you prefer to stick to the Classic way of having your waffle, they do offer Bananatella, Strawberry Kisses, just to name a few. Also they have a waffle bar where you have that option to build it your way. 

I ordered the West Coast Wafflewich ($6.75). This comes with tender chicken, Tiabi sauce, avocado, tomato, cheese, and I omitted bacon. The waffle is served crispy, the tender chicken taste like its seasoned and grilled, and I really like the flavor of the Tiabi sauce. As a side note, I can't even tell these waffles are vegan. All I can taste is how savory and delicious my wafflewich is and when I dip it with a side of syrup, it makes the meal even worth ordering for another one. 

Now one of the most popular Signature Drink is Tiff's Waffle Macchiato ($4.55), which is a blend of cinnamon, vanilla, and macchiato topped with whipped cream and a churro waffle. I ordered this as a regular size hot drink with almond milk ($0.75) and requested a light whipped cream. This drink taste incredibly good! I never knew there is so much enjoyment eating a crunchy cinnamon flavored waffle churro and dipping that on a nice frothy cream. It's just so heavenly."}
{"text":"This place is super adorable and has amazing food! Great location to get away from the main strip for a little while. Service is quick and food comes out fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place while we were in vegas for our one year anniversary.  We give this place 5 stars. Taste is great and menu is original. It is a smaller joint and if busy be prepared to wait. Love the food, environment, and music. Would come back here if we visit vegas again."}
{"text":"Tell them you're staying if you want your latte in their cup with a foam design. They didn't ask me and put it in a to-go cup. Such a bummer for me since my whole reason for coming was for a fun latte. 

It was a 3 star but the menu still has me curious (half the fun) so I give it 4 stars. There are lots of vegetarian options (even a coconut bacon, bacon alternative which is shredded, roasted coconut with ketchup/liquid smoke and other ingredients that give the coconut a more savory flavor over a sweet coconut flavor. They also offer a V ice cream alternative). 

(4/5) I got a small pistachio latte because of my love for pistachio ice cream. It did not disappoint in terms of flavor. What brought me here, though, were the pictures of the fun drinks with waffles on them. Visual appeal simply makes everything taste better. My latte got defaulted into a to-go cup  even though I was never asked for here or to-go. I'd even set up my spot to study and my drink came after 3 others drinks so there was time to simply glance over and see I was staying (not populated at all, regardless of the three previous orders). So if you come and want a foam design, verbalize that it's for here. 

(2/5) I also got the kale chocolate chip cookie- the green cookie. I'm all about the healthy way of life but this did not make me want to stay on track. Yes, you could taste the kale. The cookie was fluffy (I'm thinking lots of flour), and had I not had my coffee I wouldn't have finished it. It wasn't sweet like a cookie, but it did remind me of a scone without the shape. I probably would have liked it if I was thinking I was getting into a scone, actually. Subbing out for larger chocolate chips would have also added to the texture in a positive way. 

I asked a lot of questions, some were answered with \"I don't know\" with no intention on finding the answer (such as when I inquired about the different types of cookies) and others were answered by the guy making the drinks. I sort of felt like an inconvenience and like I should just go and sit back down because they wouldn't elaborate much without me 'pressing.' But the cashier could be new. I don't know. 

I loved the menu. It looks really interesting and I love places that have originality. 

The restaurant didn't have a warm, cozy feel but it was nice, nonetheless. Fun, far chalk wall mural. Actually, chalk was the main art theme. I liked it. 

The music was reggae. I dig. Perhaps a little loud. Startling at times. 

Definitely give this place a try, though."}
{"text":"Such delicious food, went here for lunch and had a delicious waffle sandwich South American wafflewich and I Had the ice cream sandwich delicious 
The smells in the restaurant was amazing"}
{"text":"I'm very particular when it comes to my coffee. I'm diabetic, so finding sugar free options is really hard. This place makes an good sugar free vanilla iced coffee. West Coast Waffle Sandwich was awesome too. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"SMOOTHIE IS THE BEST THING HERE......not coffee....or waffles

For a place that is specifically a coffee and waffle place... Both the coffee and waffles are not that great. The coffee is mainly milk and barely any coffee. We tried a skinny latte, iced coffee, tiffs coffee with a waffle on top. The coffee flavor is not strong at all but mainly milky ... Maybe next time we should just order black coffee. 
The waffles on the other hand are kinda soggy. They are topped with so much whipped cream and sauces that is what probably took out the good crunch in the waffle. 
The best thing at this place was their smoothies surprisingly. I would give their smoothies a 5! The Green Nut is absolutely the best smoothie ever! And it is healthy with almond and kale it is so refreshing!! I would highly recommend it to anyone. I would come here again but ONLY to get another smoothie not for anything else. 

Also there is a good groupon for this place my friend and I tried it out we each bought $24 worth at this place. But interestingly enough the Groupons  come in three separate Groupons worth $8 each. I am ok with that because we can come multiple times, but when I came with my friend he had his groupon and I had mine and they had the audacity to question us and tell us that we cannot use it when coming within \"one visit\" well he bought his separate and I bought mine. It is a different transaction who cares it is also separate visit because it is his visit, then my visit. 
Also,what if I wanted to use my second groupon would it be considered a \"different visit\" if I walked out the door then came back in? They are sticklers about this rule so if you bought a groupon then watch out they are going to grill you about it!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some waffle sandwiches or delicious drinks.  Also, the music had me feeling nostalgic, all hits from the 90s, which is a good thing.  A lot of students study here from what I saw.  Very nice workers here and they accommodated a side of eggs for my toddler.  We used the one high chair in sight."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Wife and I shared a wafflewich and a golden waffle. I also had the Snickers iced coffee. Menu is very eclectic. You can tell they are working on the decor as they use paintings from local artists. Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! I ordered the West Coast waffle sandwich and the BananaBerry smoothie. The only thing it lacked was that the sandwich took awhile for it to come out and it wasn't busy when I went, other than that I would definitely come back hoping for faster service!"}
{"text":"Bought the groupon so I had the opportunity to check out this spot 3 times. Suffice to say, after all 3 visits, I thought that it was OK.

I guess that this place focuses mainly on waffles used in a traditional sense, with sweet toppings, as well as savory preparations, such as using a pair of waffles as a bun for a sandwich.

First off, I would say that using the groupon was pretty difficult here. I had 3 of them, good for $8 to spend. The waffles ranged from 5-6 dollars, and the coffee drinks ranged from 4-5. You do the math. I think it would have been better to offer 2 $5 for $10, instead of the 3 $4 for $8.

The good news first. The fillings and toppings they use are great! For the hashtag breakfast sandwich, the egg and turkey sausage was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. For the Tokyo sandwich, the chicken was moist and tender, and the veggies were very fresh. The sauces they use are well balanced, the sweet ones aren't too sweet, and the savory sauces are packed with flava!

The bad news. I hated the waffle. I've tried both the thin waffle they use for sandwiches, and the thicker Belgium style one. My conclusion is that I frankly don't like their waffle recipe. They both had a strong metallic taste that resonated the more I ate it. This happens when I eat biscuits or other quick breads that use too much leavening, such as baking powder. This may be the culprit. The interior of the waffle is pretty doughy as well. 

Also, it took a little longer that I though it would to receive my order. On my last visit, I ordered a waffle sandwich, lolly waffle, and small hot coffee, and I timed them at 16 minutes. It would be better than to rather than to stack 3 separate customer orders at the same time, it's better to do one order at a time, because the 2 other people received their orders 1 minute after mine was ready :/

The coffee is ok but pricy for the portion size. The employees are nice and friendly, but also they seem to be easily distracted.

Wasn't the worst waffle, but not the best. Slightly middle of the pack is where I would put them. If you are in the mood for a savory waffle sandwich, this place would be the place to go because no one else in town is doing it (RIP Bread and Butter). Liked everything 'cept for the waffle itself. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Loved it here! 
I got lost and they were very friendly on the phone.
The menu has a lot of options and the prices were great. 
The honey latte was delicious and so was the viva las Elvis waffle. 
A must go off the strip pit stop!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to have lunch with my brother. The menu is self explanatory. I ate the waffle named hashtag breakfast Sandwhich and it was bomb! I also had a blended frap called white chocolate tuxedo. It was SOO good. This place is a very laid back place. Music and the environment is very welcoming! 

First time here and it won't be the last. There is a lot of things I would like to try when I come back."}
{"text":"Tiabi is a small little cafe located next to Target. I saw few students there studying since they offer free wifi. The prices were reasonable. I ordered the red velvet chocolate chip waffles. Some of the coffee beverages sounded yummy but I held off from getting one. I went during the evening so it was pretty much slow but there was some what of a wait to get our food. The waffles were good but it wasn't filling enough for me. Compared to Babystacks, Tiabi was just average."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Their coffee is phenomenal and the waffles are just incredible."}
{"text":"My second time here and still impressed ! Had \"kisses\" waffles with strawberries and bananas with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream. Came to visit Las Vegas and had to come here again. My first time was last summer. So yummy . But a tad bit pricey."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I love all of the Vegan options!! I had the Guru Burger and the Coconut mint lemonade. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Coffee is super strong. The west coast was SOOOOOO yummy. The customer service was great. Definitely will be visiting again!!!"}
{"text":"I am thoroughly impressed with this cute, small,  and quiet breakfast spot.  The waffles are oh so good!  I got the hashtag breakfast sandwich with waffles,  turkey sausage, egg and cheese.  The waffles are made fresh and they're so good.  Also I tried the waffle Macchiato and although they took a long time to make the waffle for my Macchiato they gave me an extra waffle and it was muy delicioso.  I will be back even tho I live all the way in summerlin!  I will be recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Vegan Belgian waffles with tasty toppings!! Fun little place with excellent food, great coffee and reasonable prices. Always hit it up when I'm in town. I recommend the Vegan La Elvis."}
{"text":"I can smell the wraffle once i walked in. They have a very unique menu and can't wait to try their food! 10%off when you check in and free iced coffee when you leave a review."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and yummy waffles, I just wish they were more filling.  Their coffee drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"Very good food at an affordable price. Just know that everything is freshly made so this isn't a fast food restaurant. Plane to be there for at least 10-15 to get your food but it's worth it! And it doesn't have all that junk you would get at other restaurants.  Try the Californian! And students get a discount! Just show your ID!"}
{"text":"Local place for breakfast or lunch that serves waffles either sweet or savory. Since all waffles are vegan they are flat. The one thing we all said is the food is yummy but dry. We need syrup or more sauce. Order up front. Wait for your food. Bus your own table. Tables with benches or round tables with armless chairs. Not to much room to get a scooter around."}
{"text":"We were looking for a simple breakfast place in the land of Casino breakfasts and we are glad we found Tiabi! Excellent service and very yummy food. The maple Bacon Waffle was great and reminded me of when my Dad used to make bacon waffles! Ah, sweet reminiscence! The West Coast Waffle sandwich was also delicious and it improved on a very decent chicken sandwich with the addition of waffles. If you're liking for a giant Denny's style breakfast menu this is not the place but if you want some really good waffles Tiabi is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast spots I have been to in Vegas. The atmosphere is so welcoming and the employees are very friendly. The waffles are amazing and they have so many customizable options. If you're a big coffee fan, like me, you'll love their original coffee creations. I definitely recommend this spot !!"}
{"text":"I love Tiabi! I come here because they have the best selection of waffles and waffle sandwiches. It's the best. It's a nice place to relax and have a cup of coffee too!"}
{"text":"Love the food the churros waffle topping it's really good!!! My daughter and husbands likes it... The drinks is good not to sweet not to strong.. I love the place it's small it's a chill place the smell of the place is really good... The red velvet waffle I ordered is really good with chocolate chips and chocolate syrup with whip cream and extra strawberry on the side is really good I'll be back for sure... The ladies that work there are really nice too... Oh  download the epoxy app it's a reward apps!!!  Don't forget hihi...."}
{"text":"First here in this location people that works here are nice... The place needs a little clean up... The place is really busy than the other one. The waffle makes needs to be REPLACED already or something they been wasting a lot of waffles anyway... The drink I ordered the peachy I didn't like it at all even then have to redo my drink... The waffle churros was nothing like the one at Simmons locations.."}
{"text":"Bookmarked to try this place for brunch, and I managed to go here this past Friday with the Mom and Sister. They were hesitant 'cause they hadn't been here before and were expecting to to one of our usual brunch places, but they ended up being extremely happy with the experience.
Customer service was awesome. After greeting us, the cashier noticed that we were probably new to the place, so he told us a little about the ordering process and menu (regular items, faves, and seasonal specials). Pretty chill and nice guy. 
The sister ordered the Halloween-themed menu for a waffle and a cold latte. Mom ordered a Halloween-themed hot latte with a West Coast Wafflewich. I ordered a cold Chocolate Coconut with a West Coast Wafflewich. Hahaha... The sister liked her waffle and her drink, but she wished she had ordered the same wafflewich as us. It had a pretty amazing sauce, and the ingredients tasted as fresh as can be. I will admit that I wish I had their latte though. Don't get me wrong 'cause I liked my drink, but I tasted more chocolate than coconut, and I'm looking for a balance. 
The cashier also kept making sure we were okay as I got the food whenever it was ready to be picked up from the counter. He also happened to be the busperson, nice enough to pick up after us when we were done. Sorry sir... I'll be sure to put our stuff in the bucket thing on the side when we're done. Thanks though!"}
{"text":"The clientele in this place drove me nuts. I went there 3 times and heard the word \"totes\" on numerous occasions. I also heard a \"delish\" and a \"this is so bomb.\" But the best: \"PERF.\" A girl was referring to some guy she was seeing as \"PERF.\" I couldn't unhear these conversations as millennials talk so damn loud. When I go in for visit 4, headphones will be brought. I can't listen to these kids. Darn college towns. 

Food was excellent. Staff was engaged and personable. Coffee was good. For what it is, I'd give this a 4.5, but since that doesn't exist, I'll round up. Slightly less than PERF, but I'll give it a PERF because it was TOTES DELISH...but slightly less than being SO BOMB.

Help me God."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, mellow atmosphere playing reggae music... waffles are great especially in sandwich form. West coast sandi is good in my book. The drinks are funky cool and creative, very different if you like to explore. So good thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Got here at 11:15am today for brunch. The cashier told us that it's gonna be a 15-20 minute wait and since we were hungry and didn't wanna go anywhere before my friend's flight, we opted to wait. 

I ordered a breakfast waffle and iced coffee, while my friend ordered a smoothie, latte and west coast wafflewich. 11:45 and still no food or drinks. The place was packed and there's only 3 employees- 1 cashier and 2 food prep staff. 

Since it was already 12:00, we decided to take our food to-go. Coffee was okay. Nothing special. The waffle was crisp and crunchy which was good. Breakfast wafflewich was delicious but needs a little maple syrup, which we didn't get to have anymore bec we took the food to-go. Prices are reasonable. 

I'll think about whether giving this place another try. Otherwise, they should add more staff."}
{"text":"This place had us hooked from day one. May and Tiff are so sweet and very innovative with their menu. I always get the same thing because it's just too damn good. Love the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Such good customer service! Staff is welcoming!  They have great tasting waffles and loved their latte!"}
{"text":"Love this place! First time here and for sure coming back. The staff were nice and the bananatella is to die for, and their espresso rocks! Thank you"}
{"text":"The Good
A very pleasant and nice staff with reasonably priced items.  

The Bad
The food and the wait. My wife ordered the banana Nutella waffle which came out first and the waffle was overcooked and very dry. The Nutella was flavorless and limited as it was drizzled on. My only other experience to compare this type of waffle with was at Disneyworld and there waffle was moist, soft and warm with the Nutella adding a great accent. 
I ordered the hashtag waffle and a banana Nutella for me. The hashtag was again an overcooked, dry and burnt in some areas waffle with turkey sausage that tasted like they came out of the frozen foods section at Von's supermarket.  Completely flavorless. The egg that came with it I cannot not even explain what it looked like.  My banana Nutella waffle did not even look like my wife's as by the time I got it I was told they were having issues with there waffle maker. It reminded me of one my 12 year old made me for Father's Day. 

The Ugly
Due to technical problems everything took twice as long as long as it should.  I even saw A gentleman get up who had been waiting there before us asking why was it taking so long for his food.  For my inconvenience of waiting so long they offered me a cookie. At that moment they should've offered to discount my food at least. 

One of the things I hate having to do on a yelp review is do a negative review. Hopefully, for others they will not receive this type of food or delay.  My goal is always to stay away from the chain restaurants and find those little hidden gems in the city.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the gem."}
{"text":"This place is kind of average doesn't really surprise me but it does have quite a selection of new food choices. I'm not really into the type of food though so this review is mostly biased on my point of food that I like."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with my son who's Vegan. I had the West Coast wafflewich and he had a waffle, vegan of course. I also had a side of green tea ice cream and an iced coffee. The waffle sandwich was delicious! The restaurant was clean, the staff friendly and we got our food pretty fast. I don't live in Vegas but if I did I would definitely be a regular. I would definitely recommend trying this place to any friends who visit Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Seemingly startup and had delicious waffles and coffee both iced and hot in mason jars(iced). Vegan and regular waffle options available in all flavored and styles.  Very good!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Drove by  100s of times and finally stopped by for breakfast. 

Great atmosphere. Waffle with coffee is great. Reminds me of when I was a kid and my grandma used to let me dip my Filipino bread in her coffee. 

Great place to bring a date or get some work done."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Tiabi for the West Coast waffle sandwich. It's their signature/customer favorite."}
{"text":"Nice concept, average execution. So far we had

- The West Coast with chips
- Hashtag breakfast sandwich with chips
- Golden waffles
- Bananatella
- Waffle macciato

The savory items had the potential, but it was a failure due to the lack of freshness. To be fair, they aren't pricey, so I think it's a reasonable middle ground, but I hoped something better than this."}
{"text":"I probably should go a second time just to hopefully have a change of mind. But I just didn't really care for their items and especially not their service. 

The place is small and they do offer outdoor seating however, in the middle of summer you just can't wing it. 

I ordered the West Coast Waffle Sandwich, which had bacon, tomato, avocado and chicken and their special sauce which I felt was lacking and can't say I tasted it. 

The sandwich was good and we also ordered their churro waffle with ice cream which was also good.  

We also shared a snickers iced coffee drink since they were out of the one we wanted, which was not good at all and tasted more like a cheap 7-Eleven coffee with flavorings. 

Last but not least the service.   Twice we were dropped off items that did not belong to us, luckily we didn't touch them, but perhaps a suggestion would be a number on the table system or similar.  These items went to second wrong table before they made it to the correct table.  Each time the cashier yelled out direction to the server while having patrons in front of her ordering.  Service is key no matter how small of an establishment you are. 

Not sure about this place"}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good! The staff are super friendly as well! This was my go-to spot when I was an undergrad at UNLV. Although a couple of items have changed on the menu over time, there's still a great selection and I'll definitely be back. I'm pretty picky when it comes to how my waffles are cooked and their waffles are cooked perfectly. Also, make sure you try the lavender and white chocolate latte - it's bomb!!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This place ruined all food for me. Like a virgin touched for the very first time nothing will ever quite live up to the Western Wafflewich, (more like a waffle taco),  and the golden waffle smothered in butter and sweet syrup. Two course breakfast! The memory of this meal will forever linger, sweet and savory, a place I can visit in the annals of my mind when the world is getting me down and leave smiling a happy satisfied smile."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is an amazing gem! Every time I come here I am never disappointed. My favorite is the breakfast sandwich with Turkey sausage and a side of potatoes chips that are so yummy. For those that are coffee lovers I recommend the Espresso Frankenstein this puppy would wake the dead lol. But most of all I like the staff they are super friendly and if you need help choosing whether it be your drink or food they will steer you in the right direction."}
{"text":"Go to this place.  I was hesitant about waffle sandwiches, and this place changed my world.   Had the breakfast sandwich.  Add the turkey sausage.   It was perfect.  Also had Tiffs waffle macciatio.  Sooooooo good!!! Relaxed atmosphere, great coffee food and service."}
{"text":"I tried to love this place because it looked good and was close to where I was living but I just wasn't impressed. 

I ordered the green tea drink, they were out of green tea and what they gave me instead just wasn't good. The waffle sandwich and strawberry cheesecake waffle were just okay. The lemon blueberry muffin was the best part. Although they forgot it in my order and I had to go back for it."}
{"text":"Great food! Great coffee!!! Love their Espresso Frankenstein, it's pretty is AMAZING! It's the perfect blend! We came to visit Las Vegas and had to come back a 2nd time while we were out there!"}
{"text":"Delicious #wafflesandwiches !!! Vegan options and decadent coffee options. My boyfriend and I were greeted by multiple employees and were taken great care of when ordering for the first time. We received our coffee and food in less than 10mins!! Also very chill relaxing playlist in the cafe. Great vibes!!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time today. This is a lot like waffles cafe up the street. They have a bit more of a coffee selection and all the food menu was pretty much waffle sandwiches. The prices are about the same but here you don't get chips with the sandwich and it's a bit smaller. The waffle itself was tasty  and not quite as thick so it's not so doughy. Coffee was good and the next time I come back I'll try one of the the fancier ones. As for seating there's not a lot. we sat outside, there was no open seating inside. With that being said it took a little bit of time to get the food since we were waiting for everyone a head of us which is understandable. Service was also friendly."}
{"text":"Cute local vibe, gal at the counter was friendly and the breakfast waffle was just what I needed! My short iced latte wasn't too confusing (its amazing how many people are confused when you don't want 2cups of sugar in your latte) I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent latte!   The smoothest and easiest drinking coffee I had on the weekend trip.  It blows away the $7 coffees on the strip easily.

Hashtag waffles - I have to assume they were excellent.  The kid devoured both of them in addition to the fruit toppings they came with.  This was the first time ever she finished an adult sized meal by herself!

Hashtag breakfast sandwich - This was good - the standard eggs and sausage.  If it was a runny sunnyside egg, that would have been much better.   I'd probably pass on this one to get a...

West Coast Wafflewich - now this  was a good combination of flavor and texture.  Put bacon and avocado on anything and you have a winner.

The sample of strawberry kisses was a nice way to end the late lunch.

I think i prefer the round crunchy waffles over the thicker style just because they retained their crunch.   But the coffee will definitely bring me back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a new spot I just discovered. If you love waffles, then be here. The size is fairly large for a small-stomached person like me but I wasn't gonna waste such good finds. The food was handcrafted with love. It's not noisy thus very good for reflecting on your life whilst munching on waffles and sipping coffee. The only reason I gave a four star was because I wasn't told where the water dispenser was located, so I stayed thirsty for a min. No sign indicating where to place your used baskets so I held on to it for a little longer. But I was excited she remembered to bid goodbye as I exited this miniature-yet-cool- wafs and cof spot. I'll be there again with friends."}
{"text":"This was an utter disappointment!  Super slow service, waffles are bland if you do not get all of the fruity toppings. 

My daughter said she would have preferred an Eggo waffle over this!

The Maple Bacon didn't do anything for me at all.. The bacon was basically super thin, cold and overcooked. 

I would have preferred Mc Donald's over this, I think we are headed there now!"}
{"text":"I Don't Live in Vegas and found this place off the beaten path. I love it! Vegan or non-Vegan you can go and have a great meal a good cup of coffee/smoothie in a very pleasant setting. The staff here is some of the best I have encountered in Vegas. They're friendly, helpful and always seemed to have a smile (even when things got busy and everyone was under pressure).  I now make this a place I stop at when coming to visit a few times a year. So, my only caveat to anyone reading this is this, if you are in a super hurry call a head, everything is made to order and it takes some time to cook those amazing Belgian waffles to perfection. So kick back and enjoy, I did!!"}
{"text":"Visiting in Vegas. Needing good food off the strip. Found this place. We ordered the waffledilla with avocado, breakfast sandwich, the west coast without tomatoes. All were good and savory. Also enjoyed the golden waffle with strawberries and powdered sugar as well as the churro waffle with strawberries whip and caramel. Very tasty. It was just about the perfect breakfast. The lavender latte both the hot and cold were delicious. The churro macchiato also good. The waffle that comes on the macchiato is built in dessert.  We all thought this was a great choice tasty, friendly staff. Don't be in a hurry though all is made fresh which is why it's so good but not fast food. The waffles are all vegan which is a major plus.  A great place. Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"place is amazing tons of vegan options 
amazing waffles and a lot of interesting options.
hidden gem! snickers coffee? pumpkin churro waffles? get unique! check this place out! really nice staff as well i highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great place!!!!! Their waffles sandwiches are amazing! Waffles are super soft and fluffy. All of the food tastes fresh! I am typically picky with my iced coffees but they have very good coffee beverages as well. Great and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at TIABI today! I came on a Wednesday and it was very slow... (Roberto's next door has $1 tacos on Wednesday which steals some of the business) which was good for me because I was entirely indecisive about what I wanted to order and didn't have to feel rushed. The girl at the counter was awesome and seemed happy to answer all of my questions about the menu items. Even I was annoyed at myself, but she didn't seem to be bothered.

They have a nice selection when it comes to vegan options, and I finally decided on the Thai basil wafflewich with a guru patty instead of chicken and the Honey I'm Home churro dessert waffle with vegan ice cream, and both of them were delicious! That paired with yummy iced latte with almond milk was just heavenly. 

The shop is small and I can see how during busy hours it can be hard to find a place to sit (not very many places to sit). I was happy to come during a less congested time because I got really great service and delicious food! I will definitely be coming back to try the other things."}
{"text":"This place and their team is spectacular! We had a large event here with 20 guests. Everyone was accommodating, the food was phenomenal, and there were was quite a variety for us to choose from. 

I had a hot waffle macchiato and the waffle breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage and veggies. On my way out, I got a coconut cooler, which was a totally refreshing and unique cold drink that didn't make it all the way home with me. :) Definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"The waffles were great: they did a great job with a vegan waffle! The smoothie: not so much: very thin and grainy. They had a pretty awesome pistachio latte. It's the kind of place that does a few things extremely well!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit, service was great.  Waffle was pretty good.  Pistachio latte was excellent!  I enjoy a thicker fluffier waffle but this one was thinner and crunchy.  Not bad though.  I will return to try more coffees!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when I didn't feel like walking 2 miles to dunkin donuts. Right from the start great customer service. Incredibly friendly cashier and most importantly amazing food. The waffles had the perfect texture and the fruit was so fresh. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"This spot is quite calm and cool never let me down at all it's amazing. That red velvet waffle! This is a spot that is definitely under recognized and talked about. It's in a great location and prime for locals. The menu and I always have a fight due to so many choices. They drinks is amazing and the prices are exceptionally reasonable, too reasonable if you ask me. The crunch and flavor is everything. To top it off the customer service is the greatest. You want a nice treat to get away from the Vegas hustle and bustle... this is the place"}
{"text":"The first of its name! The prodigal child of both coffee and waffle! The place where it all started and the original bringer of delicious not to all. My experiences are short here but oh so memorable. It is comforting to have the consistency in flavors and service that I have come to look forward in my every day life on both sides of town. I know come here and expect to get any one of their signature drinks or waffles and it to blow away my taste buds like no other. I also know that I can see the same great attitude and customer service from anyone in the staff. They are all kind and eager to help in any way they can and are always professional. If I ever find myself frequenting this location as much as the location in the north I know I will never be disappointed which is something that few coffee or waffle or both can guarantee so well as they do. No matter where you are in Vegas do not be afraid to venture out or go somewhere so delectable that should blow your mind. I know when I see opportunity for something Fantastic I am always down. Ps. I am always excited to see the new items they have to offer. Yum!"}
{"text":"I come here every day that I am able to. It has the best cold brew around and even if I didn't live so close I would totally go out of my way to come here, it is that amazing. I have been coming here since it has opened and did not think a place could continuously give a better experience like this one has. The whole staff has given fantastic(and I don't use the word lightly) customer service and are so inviting. Their outgoing spirits and humble attitude definitely make it a second home. Which helps me recommend this place on the daily and have had positive feedback from everyone that goes. Which also does not come easy for a self proclaimed foodie like myself. To this day my first experience here was so memorable I know it will last me a life time, which in itself is a feat that most places can match, that has hooked me for life. If you are in the neighborhood or willing to venture out for an awesome piece of treasure. Look no further and make the trek you will not be disappointed. It will be the little chariot that lights up your life."}
{"text":"Came here earlier this afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised how good this place is ! I'm not a waffle person (I'm personally a pancake or crepe person) and I absolutely LOVED my meal here. I passed by this place probably a million times since it's near UNLV but decided to come here since I got a free coupon from my school for their Tiff's waffle macchiato. I ordered their West Coast waffle which had chicken , their signature Tiabi sauce , melted cheese , avocado , tomato and I subbed their bacon for egg instead. It was pretty delicious and savory for breakfast/brunch and it wasn't too pricey ! And I was impressed w/ their waffle macchiato - I loved the cute little churro flavored waffle. Service was very friendly however they make everything by order so don't plan on rushing here to eat if you have class , etc. Also it's not a good place to study , tables are a bit dirty - it's more of a place to just to sit down & eat. They have Groupon and Yelp-in deals available too so more of a reason to come and try this place out :) and vegan options available. Will be back again to try the Savory Thai basil waffle and other menu items !"}
{"text":"Cool, unique, hole in the wall place. Every dish I've had has been great. Staff is always friendly and helpful.
Just a great place overall."}
{"text":"This place is has got to be one of my favorite spots locally for coffee and a quick bite in vegas!  I've tried the vegan Wafflewhich and not that I'm vegan but thought I give it shot and it was DIVINE. I will definitely be going back to try the rest."}
{"text":"Coffee with a side of waffles! Tiff's Waffle Macchiato, which pairs a cinnamon vanilla latte with a small churro waffle, is the perfect way to start your morning. Bonus points for being priced well too, at about $5 for a drink and treat in one! It's my go to if I pop in here.

This location is small and a bit out of the way for me, but a stop I'll make if in the area. I like the patio seating and the drink menu (the seasonal specials rock!), but generally prefer the waffles at full service restaurants better. Service could be a bit more attentive but the staff are generally pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Eh... Was going to order waffles but they had no ice cream, so I went with the avocado drink. Ummmm... No bueno. Too much ice, no flavor, and I don't think the avocado was ripe enough. I make avocado drinks and it should turn somewhat green. My drink was a pale green yellow. The lady was nice so I gave her a star and then another star for the drink. Absolute fail. Sorry guys... Just speaking the truth. Make the avacado drink more milky less icy. Or just don't call it a smoothie cause it's far from that."}
{"text":"I don't know what these guys are doing to make the waffles so good, but what ever it is they are doing it right!!! They are about to put Bruxie out of business! In all sincerity, best sandwich, waffle sandwich, and lunch/ breakfast I have had in a while! Visiting from Cali, go Tiabi! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Their vegan wafflewich is pretty tasty! I really wish they were 100% vegan! Vegan butter and vegan waffles taste just the same if not better than dairy butter or waffles. Same with their coffees. Would be way better if they were vegan. Also, the service is pretty annoying... my mother and I ordered the vegan waffle sandwiches and two coffees and I had to go up to the bar four separate times to get each item."}
{"text":"Really nice hangout place. Wait was a little long but understandable due to how busy it was. Drink was lacking sweetness but waffle was delicious!"}
{"text":"Bacon inside my waffle mmm. Had breakfast there yesterday and really considering going back for lunch today. Tiffs waffle macchiato is fantastic! Love Tiffy and Mae. Love Tiabi."}
{"text":"Yet another review to say that the customer service needs work. I came by today for a latte after finding this place on the Yelp app- it's still difficult to find, as it's in a nook of the plaza and can't really be seen from the street.
I guess their exterior signage is still being developed, because right now there's just a tarp printed with \"Coffee & Waffles\".

Went in and there seemed to be some sort of lounge affect going on. I made my way around a group of women clustered near the entrance talking, perused the posted menu, then stood behind a guy chatting at the front counter for a good five minutes before the woman he was speaking to realized I was a paying customer, and said she'd help me. 
I find it a little tacky that the employee (who seemed to be one of the co-owners) was not more attentive to the fact that I was waiting in line to place an order.
As it is, she excused herself in such a way that I felt I was inconveniencing her. 

Regardless, I ordered a skinny vanilla latte- originally planned on getting a sandwich, but it seemed this would have really been a problem to her, so I just stuck to the drink. It was tasty, even if the foam was overflowing along the lip of the lid.

Found a table of samples toward the back as I waited for my drink- the cinnamon sugar waffle and the bacon-cheddar waffle were both really flavorful, though the former was nice and crisp while the latter was more on the limp and soggy side. 

Location seems like it'll be good for students, and they seem to have a lock on the niche market- doubt bistro waffles are offered anywhere else nearby. Hope they succeed, maybe I'll be back when they work out the kinks- namely waiting for the novelty of business ownership to wear off enough for them to prioritize customer service. Their product seems like it'll do well."}
{"text":"Waffles were really good. Spruces weren't an arm and a leg and the Spot was intimate. There were cards to play with while waiting which was great for passing the time. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here.. I like the feel of the place. Took me time to order. I got the Westcoast. And it was awesome.. I got an iced coffee.. And I have to say it was pretty tasty!! I think I'll come back here again and again!!"}
{"text":"I only visited this place due to a friend wanting to try it. I've had better. The waffles came out dry. I  ordered from their savory menu and to be honest it was disappointing. The items felt like it came from a box and wasn't that much of a difference from a fast food breakfast \"sandwich\".

  I do not like the type of groupon they put out. You have to literally come back a couple of times to use all of them. The instructions are there but from now on I'm literally avoiding all groupons that expect you to come back each time to use. Actually I'm not even a fan of groupon but a friend convince me to try this place with her. Even she wasn't impressed due to the fact that she can make waffles at home that tasted better ( her words not mine).

  Coffee drinks is a hit or miss. Some tasted ok and some tasted bitter."}
{"text":"What Will You Get At Tiabi Coffee and Waffle?

Tiabi Coffee and Waffle is a rather unique counter-serve waffle place in Las Vegas. Located at 3961 South Maryland Parkway, it is at the Mission Center just north of the main UNLV campus. This place has some appealing waffle options that are different from what you'd expect elsewhere.

This spot focuses heavily on unique waffle creations. These include traditional waffles as well as some sandwiches that use waffles.

A Different Approach

Tiabi Coffee and Waffle is a contemporary dining spot that offers various types of waffles. It has many vegan food options and plenty of different coffee choices. It was established in 2013 and continues to be an entertaining place for waffles.

This spot has a rather modern look that isn't too unique or different. Still, it is an intriguing place to visit. It has a friendly look to it that stands out as an inviting spot for all members of the family.

What Does It Take To Get Waffles?

The food here at Tiabi is excellent but it can take a while to get. We waited about twenty minutes to get our food. However, we assume that this is because the food is so intricate and designed with an immense approach to detail.

The people here are friendly and do well with getting orders down. They always ensure that the food is made precisely as desired. The fact that these people can work with vegan requests if desired is an attractive point too. It ensures that people can get a great waffle even if they have particular limits on what they will eat.

Great Foods All Around

The foods here start with plenty of great signature beverages. Tiff's Waffle Macchiato has cinnamon vanilla macchiato with a churro waffle and whipped cream. This has a brilliant design that is creamy and detailed.

The Stiles Java Jolt has a vanilla breve misto and vanilla with a bit of extra espresso. This adds an extra amount of caffeine to create a good taste. Various frappes and teas are all around the place too.

The creative nature of this place is particularly highlighted in the waffle sandwiches it offers. The Waffledilla features chicken, Tiabi sauce and melted cheese and an optional avocado. This is carefully made with waffle patties to establish a great flavor all around.

The classic options here are interesting to see as well. The Strawberry Kisses waffle mixes sliced strawberries with a chocolate drizzle. The Viva Las Elvis waffle has bananas and peanut butter plus chopped bacon. A bit of honey is added to create a stronger flavor too."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! Nice laid back atmosphere. Great food. Great price. Great service. I had the viva las vegas waffle. Banana, PB, and bacon. Will come every time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is amazing great vibes and even better food. Everyone was very helpful and super friendly. The food was so good and I was surprised that it was all vegan. It tasted better than most regular waffle I've had. I can't wait to come here again and soon!"}
{"text":"The have an interesting, diverse menu, but I've never had anything I didn't like. The staff and owners are awesome people with a passion for food. Everything is reasonably priced and you get a satisfying meal every time. Love it."}
{"text":"excellent idea. i went for breakfast with a friend and it was busy but quiet enough to be considered intimate. the coffee was not the best i've had but it was not bad. the presentation of my waffle was pretty good but i feel like they were a little scarce on the toppings."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Jay, the manager, was incredibly helpful and very passionate about the menu offerings."}
{"text":"Environment is great..   coffee is great...  Food is great...  Service is great AND their kale vegan cookies are absolutely AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little cafe in the target plaza center. The cashier was nice and friendly. My hubby had the hashtag breakfast waffle sandwich which was awesome. I had the smores waffle which was a little too rich and sweet for me and I have a serious sweet tooth. I also had the green nut smoothie which was pretty good as well. The wait however was pretty long like 45 mins to receive our food and I was almost late to an appointment. There's vegan options for vegans that I thought was cool. I'll give them another try though to get my own breakfast waffle sandwich."}
{"text":"Def. recommend. Awesome coffee and eclectic breakfast options ranging from my preferred West Coast waffle sammie & then hubby's Viva Las Elvis waffle!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A joke.  If all you want is a coffee and a waffle allocate an hour.  It took over five minutes for my mocha and over 25 minutes for a single plain waffle.  They weren't even busy.

Even worse was watching the cook literally man handle every waffle that came out. Hopefully his gloves aren't latex because he would send anyone with a latex allergy to the hospital with his pulling waffles hot from the iron off with his fingers and then flipping the waffle between both hands then shoving them back on to the iron if he decided it wasn't dark enough. Despite the constant fiddling my waffle still managed to come to me cold.  It couldn't even melt the butter on it.

Flavor wise its not worth anything. My mocha was so over chocolated that the only flavour from the coffee was a bitter under note.  As for the waffle it was so nothing I might as well have had an eggo or poured bisquick shake and pour into my waffle iron 

Oh, and they no longer offer Belgian waffles.  

Just skip it. Unless you are a hipster wanting to be seen to be tragically hip, there is no reason to waste the time."}
{"text":"I tried this place this morning and it was a great experience. I ordered an iced Tiff's Waffle Machiatto and it was bombdotcom. Just the right amount of sweetness, just the right amount of milkyness, and just the right amount of ice. The quality of the coffee is legitimate. A+ on the drink.

I also ordered some golden classic Belgium waffles. Finally, I find a place here in Las Vegas with real waffles. Waffles are supposed to consist of a juxtapose balance of crispy exteriors and soft almost custardy interiors. These waffles had that. They were so delightful to eat that I didn't even bother drenching them with maple syrup or butter. 

I would definitely go again for their coffee and 2 nice little Belgium waffles to accompany my delightful coffee. Great job Taibi!
-Ozzy"}
{"text":"Visiting Tiabi makes me wish there was one in Arizona! I love the concept here- all things waffle and coffee related. I came in with a suitcase as to make a quick last minute stop for breakfast and get a caffeine fix. The girl at the front was so friendly and welcoming! 

What I had: 

Breakfast Sandwich + well done bacon + extra cheese: 
This was the perfect combination of sweet, fluffy, and savory (and crunchy from the bacon). One thing I was worried about was the waffle being too sweet, but instead it had subtle hints of maple flavoring. Perfect.

Tiff's Waffle Macchiato: A cinnamon vanilla macchiato topped with a churro waffle. A perfect creamy consistency, and the churro waffle adds the perfect touch of crunchiness- if you dip it into the drink. What dreams are made of. 

Whenever I visit Vegas again, I'll definitely be stopping by to say hello again!"}
{"text":"Peaceful atmosphere. If you want strong coffee, it's a good place to go. They also make different tea. Chill music. Reminds me of artsy Philadelphia PA vibe. Would be great if they allowed vaping and or made it into a hookah bar."}
{"text":"I have never wanted a local business to succeed more than this one. If you are debating \"Is TIABI the right place for me to eat?\", I must ask you to consider the following

1. Do you like food? If not, this isn't the right place for you. Actually, you should probably go to the hospital (please see my Yelp! reviews on my favorite hospitals)
2. Do you like food that tastes delicious?
3. Do you like breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner? Do you like smoothies? Do you like coffee?
4. Are you a vegan? If not, are you an omnivore?

If you answered yes to all of those questions, then you will probably love TIABI. Waffles are cooked to a perfect texture that's not so chewy/thick that you want to die halfway through. All of the smoothies are delicious (my personal favorite are the Health Nut and the Avocado, but you do you). Breakfast, lunch, and casual dinner options. Additionally, very extensive vegan menu. Do you have an enemy? Don't tell them about this place. Do you have friends? Do them a solid and meet them there over a Waffle Macchiato and a Break The Fast sandwich."}
{"text":"This place was my favorite a couple of years ago when they first opened and had only one location. Today I had a random craving to get the one drink I sideways get from them, kale champ smoothie. 

Out of all the kale drinks I have tasted and tried theirs was by far the best and I literally had it every other day. Today though, years later, my bf went to pick one up for me. 

When I first saw it my initial reaction was that it looked more green than usual. And then when I tried it, it was definitely NOT the kale champ I knew and loved. It was waaaay too bitter and I felt they left out an ingredient, maybe banana. Had I gone there and ordered it myself and tried it before leaving, I would have asked them to recheck it or add something to it to make it drinkable. I feel it's a waste of money just throwing it out so I'm forcing myself to gulp large amounts of it. I may have to adjust it myself too but it's just disappointing..."}
{"text":"The waffles seemed kinda pricey for the size. I had the Viva Las Elvis and it was good but nothing fancy. It was the perfect texture though, crisp but kinda fluffy"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat coffee and waffles that is diverse, takes awhile to order, even longer to get your food and and has very little seating, then this place is for you.  We entered this place at 11:00 and the few tables they have were taken with people playing cards and gossiping.  The people behind the counter do not greet you yet acknowledge you as your standing at the counter waiting to order.  Finally got our food at 11:35 and took it to go because there was nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"The problem with asking for a tip before service -

The food was mediocre, the service was delayed and then when my son asked for a cup for water he was blown off..."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I thought, Crap!. Crap! not again.. Another crappy-overpriced hipster wanna-be \"cafe\" . . .  chalkboard paint, hand-drawn menu, attractive employees that are smiling. Dammit. I reluctantly ordered the Vegan Waffle-\"burger\", with a side of peanut sauce, for 6 bucks. For 6 bucks, that's amazingly cheap for Vegas. Ok, then I added the Frankenstein and my friend ordered. A Steel Pulse song came on the overhead, and now, breakfast for two, was under $20. Yes. This, is what is up. Definitely my new go to spot."}
{"text":"Tiabi is a cute little place hidden in a strip mall. Their concept is simple: WAFFLES. They have waffles for everything, with everything. Waffle breakfasts, waffle sandwiches, waffle coffees. We went here in the afternoon when it was slow; no lines and plenty of staff running around. My party ordered three food items and three drinks. The first two waffles came out in about 10 minutes. The third took 30 MORE MINUTES. The first two were done with their meals (and then drinks) before the last waffle came out. There were three staff members basically standing around looking at the waffle makers. No one looked like they were in a hurry to get our food out. There was no apologies or anything as to why the food took 40 minutes after ordering to be prepared. 

The food and drink were good once they were out, but I expect a business, whose sole food item is waffles, to be able to put out items in a reasonable amount of time. I suggest they order an extra waffle maker (or dozen) so this isn't a hamper on their business anymore. I sincerely hope they fix this, for an otherwise fine cafe."}
{"text":"I love the small business feel of this restaurant. Reasonable prices for great food. I almost always order the vegan version of the Viva Las Elvis and it never disappoints. If you're confused on any part of the menu, they will take the time to explain anything to you. No pushy upselling either which is definitely a plus. Be prepared to wait based on the amount of people ahead of you since everything is made to order. However, definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great waffles and coffee. Only complaint is that it is not very noticeable from street. Passed this place a dozen times and never noticed it."}
{"text":"AWE-Mazing!
Gluten free and dairy free waffles with diaya cheese and fresh ingredients!
We had the Thai Basil waffle sandwich and the vegan wafflewich and both were amazing!
We are def coming back for more.
The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming as well!
Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened almost 4 years ago. Always amazing service. Great food. Favorite place to grab something to eat and talk."}
{"text":"I am not even a Waffle fan but tried this through a groupon while on vacation in Vegas. Their west coast waffle sandwich is amazing. I went back and didn't even bother with their other waffles, which I'm sure are as amazing. They are warm, crispy and amazing. Try their peach green tea also. I wish there was one back home in Indiana, I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"I've seriously lived within 5minutes away from Tiabi for 3 years now and I can't believe I have just barely discovered it! I would always go to the target in the same plaza and Sakana sushi right next to it, so I always saw Tiabi's sign... I just never actually went in until a few weeks ago! Since then I've been addicted and wish I walked in to try it sooner! 
So far I've tried the Break Your Fast, Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich, Tokyo Sandwich, Guru Burger, and the churro waffle as well as the Honey Cream Latter, Lavender Latte, and my favorite yet - the Pistachio latte!! I am seriously addicted. 

Needless to say, customer service is amazing. The staff are all so welcoming and kind. 

As for the food.. The way they make their waffles is so different than I'm used to. They're thinner than typical fluffy waffles, which give their sandwiches the perfect crunch and texture! I assumed the waffle sandwiches would be soggy, but they weren't at all. Also, for the dessert waffles, the waffles have the perfect texture. While the outside is crispy, the inside is still quite fluffy despite how thin it is! Specifically for the churro waffle, the cinnamon sugar was not at all too strong, it was perfect.. Not too sweet and not at all lacking flavor. Also don't be shy about trying out any of their waffle sandwiches, at first I was skeptical because I've never tried a waffle sandwich, but each one I've tried have been really good. Tiabi puts flavors and items that really compliment each other. I don't even know what their Tiabi sauce consists of, but it's a great flavor in many of their items. 
Okay now for the drinks... If I had to single out my ultimate favorite Tiabi menu item I would have to say 100% the PISTACHIO LATTE. Hahaha. The staff must think I'm crazy because I've been coming back so many times for that drink. I get it hot with soy and ahhh it's literally heaven. It's so good that I make any of my friends around me to try it and each one of them were in love too. It's so silky with that perfect flavor of pistachio - seriously spot on pistachio! I have also tried the Lavender Latte and the Honey Cream Latte, which are good as well, but no where near the pistachio latte! Hahah

So by my review I think it's only obvious that I'm in love with this little whole in the wall and would recommend anyone to stop by. Aside from their food and drinks options, the little cafe itself is so adorable!! The decorations are cute and it's so cozy to do homework/study or even hang out with friends. Even though it's a bit small, they actually have plenty of tables/seats and even a cozy couch! Plus each table has a deck of cards and they also offer of board games for people to play as well. Awesome place, great food/drinks, with a lovely staff :)"}
{"text":"The Best taste ever I love wallfel





The best Taste ever. I go at least once a week.with a friend the male beacon got to try they when I come in the door I want maple bacon waffle. Try it just the right amount of bacon cooked in it.
Marie Johnson"}
{"text":"So don't expect a chain style meal or speed. These are regular people cooking delicious food!  We had the maple bacon Belgium waffle, Nutella waffle nut, caramel macchiato, banaberry smoothie, and the banana Nutella waffle. WOW!

Awesome place, great service, AMAZING food!  If you haven't tried this place, you should."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.. Very nice place with a friendly staff. I'll be back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"First time here didn't know what to get so many great options ended up getting the west coast and fiancé got bananatella both great waffles!! The west coast had good flavor. The bananatella was just right not too sweet. The sunrise smoothie was  also a great drink.very refreshing!! Would recommend to anyone looking for great waffles."}
{"text":"This place is the best! They have a very friendly staff and their waffles are on point!! I love their red bull apple cider and their waffle sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This was a gem I discovered by accident through a coupon. The staff are friendly. They offer a great selection of waffles and blended coffee. They have plenty of vegan options and also make gluten-free waffles on request. My boss eats gluten free and forgot to mention it, but they switched her waffle out with a gluten free one with a smile. I love the laid back atmosphere and the 70s music!

The waffles taste great and you can find something for almost anyone as long as you like waffles. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think I may be in heaven. I found this place by luck since I am going to an event at the Clark County Library. When I walked inside, the batista was very friendly. There is so much to eat and choose for, but it's not overwhelming: it makes me want to come back and try more! With this being my first visit, I got the Tiff ' s Waffle Macchiato. Why yes I would love a waffle with my coffee. As I'm writing my review, I'm thinking of ordering more food because I need these speciality waffles (breakfast, lunch, and dessert) in my life.  I just received my drink. First sip and I am in love."}
{"text":"Delicious food, vegan and gluten free friendly. Great service! Try the coconut cooler for a refreshing drink."}
{"text":"Oh my damn! This may be a hidden gem on the east side of lasvegas how did i not know this place extisted i have no clue! I went in with a coworker to get some brunch. We walked in and some nice tunes was on the radio so im already grooving while standing in line and feeling the environment. The cashier was friendly took all my orders quickly there was only two working at the time so we were in no rush. The lay out of restaurant gives a nice mellow vibe has some pretty cool stuff on the walls....now on to the food. Lol

One of my coworkers and i got the Westcoast Wafflewich bannatella waffle maple bacon waffle and a veggie sandwhich peach ice tea redbull cider and tropical tea (i cant remember the whole name)
While we were waiting the family before us had their order come out and their stuff looked amazing! So i became anxious to eat my wafflewhich before i got to the office. Anyways i get back unwrapped it took a bite and a chorus of hallelujah went through my head. It had the right amount of seasoning the waffle itself was nice and fluffy the chicken had seasoning it was just awesome and awesome doesnt even do it justice. 
My friend loved her veggie wafflewhich and the whole office was happy about this place.
Oh and the peach tea was good also.
One thing is that if they could have an option of battered chicken to give a little crunch that would be good!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, the online ordering has gone downhill. I order a coffee and a wafflewich and no joke, took 40 minutes. And there were literally zero other customers there. I wanted to grab breakfast before work, guarantee that won't happen again. This was my new regular spot, but when I order and they don't 'grab' my order for 20 minutes? No. I think the only reason they saw my order this time was because I called to see the delay. 

Last time I ordered, they didn't see it until I walked in the door, 30 minutes after I placed it. What's the point?

Food is good I guess, I mean it's waffles. Hard to mess up, right? Coffee is stellar. It's gonna be a while till I come back. If at all."}
{"text":"They are always so uplifted and friendly here! Plus the coffee is good and the walledilla is stellar, my favorite."}
{"text":"I woke up deathly hungry and happened to be nearby Tiabi. I had it bookmarked for a while just was never in the area to try it out for breakfast. IM SO GLAD THAT I STOPPED BY! I ordered the Bacon Breakfast sandwich and it was delicious! (Would highly recommend) Can't wait to come back and try some of the other options.
Side note: Very Cozy & relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious waffles! Had the red velvet waffle and West Coast wafflewhich. Both were delicious. Tender chicken on the west coast and just the right amount of sweetness from the red velvet waffle"}
{"text":"Just in town for a visit and discovered this place.... AMAZING!!! They have Vegan and Meat options. Their waffles are 100% Vegan and coffee is locally roasted. 

The churro waffle... I didn't even know that this can be done. We also touched on a few lattes. I recommend the pistachio latte (mind blown) plus everything they have to eat. I will definitely make this a routine every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Viva Las Elvis! A Belgian Waffle stuffed with peanut butter, topped with bacon and bananas! Sorry, no photo. It did not last very long!

Good coffee and chai. The South American Waffle Sandwich was pretty excellent, too!"}
{"text":"My first time here! Coming to get a cup of coffee and waffle before going to wait my lunch at Oyster bar. The staff was super nice!! I had so many requests and she was very patient to listen to me and explain to the barista! Will come back again for sure on my next Vegas trip :) 

Nutella waffle and honey creme latte are recommend!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and wanted to check out a local breakfast eatery and I'm so happy I went off the reviews for Tiabi Coffee & Waffle. There is plenty of seating and it's nicely decorated. We were instantly greeted by the friendly staff and very helpful as to what recommendations in food. My husband ordered the West Coast Wafflewich (waffle folded in half with chicken, Tiabi sauce, bacon, avocado,tomatoe and cheese) and I ordered from the Waffle Bar a Golden Waffle with Thrifty vanilla ice cream, strawberry, powdered sugar and whipped cream. Hands down this has been the most tastiest & creamiest waffle I have ever tasted.   When in town come to Tiabi and check this place out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Average at best, expensive for what you get. The coffee was below average, the guy who was at the register looked stressed and flustered, which really didn't make sense. It took a really long time to get the waffles, which again, didn't make sense as the place wasn't busy and there were 4 people working. Cool concept, poor execution."}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 stars, but I don't know why they have been so slow lately. I LOVE them here. They have great coffee, the waffles are de-lish and they have a plethora of vegan waffles. The wait time is a little excessive though. I come in a lot and every time have waited over 30 minutes for my order! I never complain, but when this is a recurring problem then they should find a solution. I will definitely continue to frequent this place, but be warned that you'll be waiting a long time, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Once they get their sign they may be easier to find. The food was Ok."}
{"text":"BOOM!!!  A hidden gem in LV. Great atmosphere and good food. Actually was so good that we came back 3 days in a row. So the food was good, but the coffee. WHOA!!!  They know their coffee. Literally the best coffee I've ever had. Seriously this is worth a visit. 

Good food, GREAT coffee, and really good service. Definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Churro waffles are absolutely genius! If you are in Las Vegas, take a side trip parallel to the Strip on the east side and grab you a churro waffle. This waffle is thin and crispy, generously sprinkled with cinnamon. Add powdered sugar. We got double ice cream. We forgot to redeem our 10 o/o off check-in offer. They kindly honored it after we already paid. Great service and food. This was one of the best things I ate in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here on accident when looking for a place for breakfast. I don't particularly like waffles, so I was out of luck for breakfast options. I tried the coconut iced coffee concoction, and it was pretty good and well priced (compared to the flavored starbucks coffees' prices). The breakfast waffle sandwich I got had eggs, bacon, and cheese on it. It was pretty good, but the waffle batter was kinda bland and wasn't as crispy as I would have expected--but then again, I rarely order waffles. I'm a pancake or crepe or any other breakfast type fan. 
Two drinks (OJ and iced coffee) and two waffle sandwiches were about $20, so I thought it was a little high on the sandwiches for the bland-ness. Maybe the dessert ones are better. The coffee was really good. 
Thought it was weird to ask for a tip on the swipe-payment thing before receiving the food--I left some cash on the table after it was brought out despite paying for the food with a card. I can see how that could be convenient for people without cash on-hand, but I don't like tipping before receiving service. The dining area is really small, but they do offer outdoor seating (in Vegas heat, I'm not sure who'd take them up on that offer this summer, but hey.)

Overall, I like the coffee!"}
{"text":"So many vegan options.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Reasonably priced.  Amazing food!"}
{"text":"I've only recently started coming here and I love it. The people are wonderful and so is the food. I get the #hashtagbreakfastsandwhich and either the very peachy shaken tea or the Frankenstein expresso. I love this place and not to mention coming in Saturday mornings and hearing live music!"}
{"text":"I love this cute little coffee shop. My absolutely favorite drink is the \"stiles Java jolt\" over ice. The staff is very friendly here! I love having a coffee shop like this one so close to home"}
{"text":"Came back the very next day. I will be craving the Guru burger for weeks. This seriously needs to be on a vegan foodie bucket list."}
{"text":"Ordering process takes forever. Spent at least 10 minutes in line with only three parties ahead of me. That being said, waffle macchiato is delicious as was the West coast sandwich. An inexpensive breakfast just barely worth the wait."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Tiabi's since they opened in 2013 and love it!  We bring all of our friends here.  

The waffles are a great small size so I never feel over stuffed.  They are so light and crispy, made hot and fresh to order.  The hashtag is my favorite.  I love their coffee too.  We have never had a bad meal.  I highly recommend this place!

It's kind of hidden back around the corner from Target."}
{"text":"My first time here, been wanting to try this place for quite some time! 
Vegan tiabi waffle w coconut bacon & strawberries was amazing! Tasted perfect. The syrup is just right too, not too sweet or sticky. 
Service was on point."}
{"text":"Came here as a casual meeting with a colleague. It's a small diner type layout with lots of options for waffles and coffee. I liked the décor inside and felt welcomed. I would come here again. 

tl;dr: Simple contemporary style. Eat and go, self-serve."}
{"text":"This place looks so nice and looks like Middle Eastern mixed with a very homely place. Everytime visit I always find ways to plan ahead for another visit"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the place . Delicious waffles. And the I ed coffee too. Our favorite place. Make sure to visit"}
{"text":"Tiabi Is one of my all-time favorite places in the city to go just to get some quiet time, some really good vegan food for breakfast, coffee and an environment where I can just focus on work that I need to get done. It's good at any point throughout the day because they had something on the menu for breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I just ordered coffee here.  I gave it three stars because the coffee was a little weak for my taste. I wanted the coffee with a little kick.  
However, the service was very pleasant.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. 
Again, 3 stars strictly because of weak coffee
Would like to try their food next time.  They have a interesting menu items I would like to taste."}
{"text":"Tiabi is an oasis of calm and deliciousness in the whirlwind of over-priced and under-delivered breakfast joints littering the desert of Las Vegas. I enjoyed the $6 Strawberry Kisses waffles, which struck an impeccable balance between sweet, filling, and light on the palate. A perfect antidote to a night of regret or morning preparation for wandering through the sinful daytime sun, the iced coffee is also refreshing and prepared with care and attentiveness."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, only 1 waffle maker was working when me and my party of 8! came in. I'm sure rolling out one dish at a time is not the norm. Personally, I don't get waffles as sandwich breads. But, everyone else in my party will give this place 4 or 5 stars for the food. Customer service and coffees were on point."}
{"text":"When I could be at school studying, I decided to go to Tiabi's to get a nice breakfast with friends. 

I got the West Coast. It had chicken, bacon, cheese, and avocado. Pretty delicious for breakfast and not too pricy. I do not have any other waffle sandwich locations in mind besides Bruxie, so Tiabi's is convenient since it's down the street from UNLV! 

Service was friendly, but I'd say they're a tad slow, so don't plan on rushing here to eat if you have class or somewhere to be!"}
{"text":"I love waffles! I saw this on Yelp and I had to make a visit. It was a cute place. Good atmosphere. I got the hashtag breakfast sandwich, which was good, but it wasn't amazing. It was a waffle sandwich with turkey sausage, egg and cheese served with fruit. Something I could make at home. I also got the \"Honey I'm Home\" dessert waffle. It was like a churro waffle with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and I loved it! TIABI is good, but not amazing compared to other waffle sandwich places I've visited in California. Their waffles aren't as good quality. Other places are more light, crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"Great coffee spot just a few miles down from the Rio. Easy to get to. Great coffee and waffles. My daughter and I split the Elvis. Service was excellent all the staff was friendly. Not a fake give me your money friendly, a real genuine friendliness. Will have to remember to come back in future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were very good. The service was just okay. The lady taking orders was not very friendly,  but the people putting the food out were very nice and apologetic for being slow."}
{"text":"Quaint little spot by UNLV, good coffee, enviroment and people; would come again"}
{"text":"(Vegan here) I had a lavender latte (sub dark for white chocolate, and almond for dairy milk) and the churro waffle, sans honey, drizzled w syrup, topped w non dairy ice cream and it could not have been better. Friendly service, clean, unique character. Recommend!"}
{"text":"The vegan options here are so amazing and are so delicious.  The staff are also extremely friendly.  The food is so tasty that we had to come back before we leave Vegas.  I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Tiabi is a unique and extremely well executed concept See below for Pros and Cons

Pros
From a very quirky minimalist design that makes the very industrial space feel like a cozy coffee shop. 
The Coffee is very good, one of the 5 best coffee shops I've tried in Vegas and I try a new coffee shop almost every Saturday.
The Waffle based food is delicious and unique
The Staff is super friendly
Meeting people in the social collision area of the shop makes meeting new people super easy!

Cons
It's location is kind of hard to find.
It doesn't have enough space to accommodate it's rush
There is no bicycle parking

Overall, everything that Tiabi can control is really really well executed, the things beyond their control they've done a great job of mitigating."}
{"text":"I had an amazing red velvet waffle with chocolate and whipped cream. The West Coast sand which was really nummy and filling. I enjoyed the little shop even though the area isn't located in the best part of Vegas. The coffee was tasty for a non speciality location. I would visit again next time I am in Vegas. Maybe try one of their dessert coffees or a vegan option."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. I got the vegan Viva alas Vegas waffle (waffle with PB, banana, agave, and coconut bacon) and my mom got a waffle with fresh fruit. It was all heavenly, and the environment is very laid back as well. The employees were so nice too!!"}
{"text":"Totally digged this spot! Great service and yummy menu! I had the waffledilla and pistachio latte with soy milk. Forgot to add on avocado on my waffledilla but it was still yummy! I'll be sure to visit again when I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"I am a new resident of Las Vegas. I had a full day of unpacking and purchases to do so I wanted a nice breakfast to start the day. I found TIABI on Yelp as a nearby new breakfast spot and I am very happy I came ! The snicker iced coffee tasted like a sweet treat and the golden waffle was very tasty. I especially liked the portion size, not too much not too little. I will return. Oh and the music was great. Thanks !"}
{"text":"As I'm writing this review, my mouth is watering. I found this spot on Groupon. After some confusion about using 3 separate groupons for 1 person, we were able to order. Based on the line behind me, I knew the food should be good. I had the Churronimo which is the vegan waffle with cinnamon sugar and a latte. OMG, I normally don't order cinnamon sugar items but this was so good. This makes me wanna leave Maryland and hike it to Nevada. The \"chefs\" were friendly and accommodating. My only gripe is that it took a long time to get our food. Other than that, I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago and never got the chance to write a review until now. Gabby was really helpful at the cash register, went over the menu with me and my friend since we were first timers. The food was great, but their drinks are definitely overpriced"}
{"text":"They are getting exceptionally slow for an order of waffle even when the store is empty. Waited for a total of 35 minutes to get my sandwich. Workers kept on talking and all I get after is \"sorry for the wait\""}
{"text":"After much procrastination, finally decided to check this place out. It was well worth the wait and is an amazing spot. The atmosphere and decor is absolutely amazing. A very relaxed but nice place to go and enjoy a waffle and coffee. The Recommendations given by one of the employees were perfect. Extremely friendly staff and very polite. The Java Jolt, and Tiff's Waffle Macchiato are very delicious. As well as the West Coast Wafflewich. The price is pretty decent for the quality. Definitley will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We ventured outside of the strip to try something different. In the mood for waffles so we tried this place based only on the good yelp reviews. It's only 3 miles from the strip but it's located in a very ghetto area, very seedy, didn't feel clean or safe. The waffle place was ok, low end diner. Food was average, nothing special. I don't think it's worth the drive outside of the main strip."}
{"text":"Let's start it off by saying this: I friggin love waffles. I dream about soft waffles. I love waffles, I love strawberries, I love tea, juices, sandwiches, quesadillas... so I was REALLY looking forward to this place. We came in and we ordered the strawberry kisses and the west coast. Get a taste of sweet and savory. We also got the snickers coffee and some juice that was seasonal. 
I'll start by saying I liked the snickers thing. But then I have to move into the bad part. 
They seem to use the same waffle mix for their sweet and savory waffles. What does this mean? It means my breakfast was too savory and my lunch was too sweet. And I was very bummed. I swear, I wanted to like it. I might even try it again some day, in hope of a good wafflewich. But it fell short. The strawberries on top helped amp up the breakfast, but the lunch could not be saved. So be it. We had a great time at SeaQuest afterwards, but I'll keep dreaming of the perfect waffle and hope Tiabi can make it in the future. Still rooting for you, but can't justify more than 2 stars for now."}
{"text":"The waffle sandwhiches are amazing. Very light but still filling and very fresh. Staff is extremely friendly and it has a very comfortable atmosphere with comfy couches, as well as tables and chairs. And wifi ;)"}
{"text":"Tiabi is great for a lighter version of Belgian waffle plates! It's located next to Target and there's a huge parking lot. I was a little hesitant to order the Bananatella because I thought it was going to be one of those heavy hitters that would make you feel overly full, bloated, and that it would be like having dessert instead of breakfast, but it was just perfect! The waffle was light, warm, toasty, and cleanly presented. For me, the dish was a good amount of sweetness topped with banana, almonds, and whipped cream. It definitely filled me up but if you're coming in famished, you should probably check out the savory wafflewiches. The woman taking our order was super friendly and was more than welcome to give us suggestions. I can definitely see this place being popular with UNLV students because there's a couch closer to the front of the store, free wi-fi, and random decks of cards at the tables but since it's the summer right now the place wasn't crowded. I'll probably have to come back and try some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Thank you Tiabi, 
I had such a great time with my friends and I. The ice coffee was awesome. The waffle was awesome. I got the breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage and added avpcado and it was delicious. 
I'm definitely coming back here again and I recommend people trying this place. It's not too expensive like other breakfast cars. The pricing is very fair."}
{"text":"Sampled the southwest waffle sandwich and while I enjoyed the combination of ingredients I felt that the waffle itself was satisfactory. The waffle was not as crispy as I liked it and almost a little under cooked. The interior of the cafe was cute and I felt that it would be a cool place for friends to hang out."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe this place the staff is amazing and the waffles are to die for ( taste them before you put syrup on it ) I had the butter pecan and my son had the banana tella both were amazing and we were glad we didn't put syrup on them because they were loaded with flavor from the first bite to the last"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmm!  I cannot get enough of this place!  The kale waffle salad is our favorite!  We split that with the Californian sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great vibs owners are sweet def luv the reggae music waffles are ahhhmazing  overall best breakfast spot off the strip!! :D"}
{"text":"Amazing! Once you enter it smells like waffles and I am in looove with the smell of waffles. I had the iced tea with hibiscus  definitely a refresher"}
{"text":"I recently found this cute little place by the UNLV. They served waffles and coffee. I love the decor here, comic books around the wall supporting local comic enthusiast. Chic, clean and smells coffee throughout. 

When you walked in, you will see the huge menu in the wall. The menu was simple and inviting. I decided to try the sweet waffle today: banana nutella and pistachio coffee. The waffle took a while to be ready but hey, it tasted soooo good so it was worth the wait. Waffle was crispy, light and gluten free! What's not to love. Pistachio coffee was also perfect, I tasted the delicious coffee, pretty strong coffee, it smelled really good too. To be noted, they support local coffee, good to know. 

I am so glad to find this place and will be back again to try their other waffles!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their customer service is great.. their waffles are delish and I had the waffle machiatto and it was perfect! Very well priced too. Will come here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unbelievably delicious. Can't imagine not coming here. Bless your taste buds and come here!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Underrated. Up n coming. A north Vegas hidden gem. 1st time here and I'll be back for sure, with more people. Atmosphere is dope with the pairings and card games to play while waiting. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Tiabi is on the Maryland Parkway side of the Target shopping center. Right now they have a tarp sign that says something to the effect of \"Coffee and Waffles\" instead of their name.

Although there is a chalkboard menu on the wall grab a menu to get the full details of the items. Order your food at the counter. Ordering was slow when I went, but hopefully will get better with time. Then find your own seat. I would recommend ordering 2 wafflewiches since they do not come with sides (besides chips) or adding items to your sandwich to make it bigger. They are petit. Here's what we ordered:

Break the Fast Wafflewich- The actual waffle is delicious. I like that it's a little sweet. It's also a harmonious texture combo- sturdy and moist. Inside were scrambled eggs, thin bacon, and cheese. The items inside were sparse and the bacon was the thin kind. The price is right (about $5), but I would gladly pay more for a fuller sandwich. I think next time I will ask for extra eggs and maybe avocado on the side.

B.A.T Wafflewich- Same great waffle housing bacon, arugula, tomato, and a delicious sauce. We also wished this sandwich was fuller. The tomatoes were great. I bet this one would be great with avocado.

Regular Coffee- I drink mine black. This coffee was a-ok and came in a to go cup.

Iced Americano- Also a-ok and definitely caffeinated.

I'll definitely be back now that I have a better idea of what to order. Businesses in this area need our support so give Tiabi a try."}
{"text":"Very helpful staff and this place is vegan friendly.  Cute spot to check out.  It's nice to have restaurant options for plant based diners."}
{"text":"Delicious wafflewich!!! Yanel and Jay are very sweet and were really accommodating with our custom orders, they provided us suggestions to make it more yummy by adding more toppings! We tried the guru burger/wafflewich with Tiabi sauce and extra avocado and the breakfast wafflewich. If you are vegan/vegetarian then this is for you :) we are surely coming back."}
{"text":"We have been trying all coffee shops around town - Sambalatte, Dutch Bros, Grouchy Johns etc and this place is for sure one of my faves now! I also ordered the West Coast waffle sandwich and it was fantastic! The waffle was so savory and made the sandwich so delicious! It's unfortunate only two people were working so the wait was a little long but it was so worth it! I'm looking forward to trying all the waffles here!"}
{"text":"This is the place to do it... So Delicious with allot of flavor. 100% recommended. Atmosphere is Good and clean Environment."}
{"text":"Only had a blended mocha frappe so far. It was really good and I was really happy that the girl who helped me was willing to use their Ghirardelli Chocolate that they use for baking instead of their normal mocha sauce. It was 10x better and the blend is really smooth"}
{"text":"We ordered Elvis waffle without any meat, bananatella, a regular coffee and a caramel
Macchiato. Waffles were good, not great - not super sweet but just right! The coffee was not great but their caramel macchiato was delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably best waffles in Vegas.Waffles are so soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. The cinnamon churro waffle s really something special."}
{"text":"Bookmarked. Just wish I lived closer, then I'd be here more often. The Twilight Lavender & Pistachio lattes are my fave. West Coast Wafflewich is bomb. Customer service is always great, never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop with great drinks! Had the Red Velvet Latte and Pumpkin Pie Cream frappucino. The Red Velvet Latte exceeded my expectations and the Pumpkin Pie Cream Frappucino was good but not as good as the other drink. It was a little too thick for my liking and tasted more like a milkshake. It was still very good though. I'd come back here if I felt like getting something with coffee but don't want to go to a chain coffee shop."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan options! Had the vegan churro waffle with bananas, chocolate chips, and vegan bacon, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Only based on the Tiffs Waffle Macchiato this Coffee is Delicious. I kinda want to drop a few stars for the wait because this wait is ridiculous. 40-50min wait for a coffee & breakfast waffle sandwich  Constructive criticism \"Hire More Staff ASAP\", get people's drinks out before the waffle, keep it moving people! This wait is not worth coming back. I don't care how delicious it is.. your going to keep losing business if you can't get it together. I'm out"}
{"text":"I found this place on Groupon and had to stop by after reading the yelp reviews. The shop itself was not very busy at the time, so it gave us some time to chat with the owners. They were super friendly and gave us recommendations on all their yummy waffles. I ordered the red velvet waffle, nutella wafflenut, and a Hey! Arnold. I loved everything, but the Hey! Arnold which is just an Arnold Palmer (cute name though!). My boyfriend ordered the Amaretto Power which was really good! We had a nice breakfast together & definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a lavender latte, think it would have been even better with an extra shot of espresso tho."}
{"text":"Met up with a group of friends on a Saturday morning around 11 am. The place was packed and it is a little on the small side. We were lucky to get a table by the front door. The menu is impressive with a lot of options. You can have breakfast or lunch, I opted for breakfast. I had the Viva Las Elvis waffle (peanut butter, bacon, bananas, and honey) and it was pretty good although I could of done without the bananas and I added maple syrup. Others in the group seemed to enjoy their meals.
Due to the small size of the place and how popular it seems I did notice that there were several people who came in but left because of the lack of seats.
I am not sure if I would come back again just because of the location. It is a little farther than I would drive just to have a waffle but if I was in the area I would go back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I even have a photo to attach. This waffle was so good, I finished it before my friend who referred this place could even ask how it was! Great selection and absolutely delicious. I also had one of their specialty drinks, a snickers iced coffee and it was amazing. A lot of sugar for the day but totally worth it. Decent parking and very affordable and quiet place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have passed by this place quite a few times and finally got a chance to stop by today.  I can honestly say I'm kicking myself for not coming in sooner. There are certainly some odd menu items, like the lavender latte, but there are also some breakfast staples like a mocha or basic waffle.  I had the bacon waffle and a honey cream latte and my husband had the breakfast sandwich and a mocha.  The bacon waffle was absolutely amazing.  Just the right amount of bacon.  The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and not at all greasy like some bacon waffles. The lattes were both very tasty. Only complaint from my husband was that the waffle  sandwich was a little dry.  So maybe order it with butter. All in all great little spot with a small outside seating area.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time after seeing such good reviews! It definitely lives up to the hype. Very nice and relaxing environment once you come in with super friendly staff. Very classic spot and definitely worth trying out the wafflewiches!"}
{"text":"Cute little place that has great tasting waffles. I ordered a double belgian waffle with vegan butter and a large iced coffee. The waffle had the perfect crunch and the right doughy center. I really like the fact that they offer vegan/vegetarian options. The vegan waffle with bananas and pecans is great.  I wish the service didn't take so long though. The two girls behind the counter are sweet but I don't think their business can handle a rush if need be."}
{"text":"Love the place!! Perfect Vegan Waffle bar, an amazing coffee, one of the best I've ever had (And I'm a coffee snob..), very decent prices and lovely atmosphere and service. 
One of my MUST visit places each time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Their Tiff Macchiato waffle really hits the spot on a chilly day...heck any day!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast/lunch places! It is conveniently located near UNLV so it's also a great place to go between classes. They have lots of options for vegans too so I definitely appreciate that. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my waffle sandwhich and drink! I had the west coast wafflewhich (the tiabi sauce was AMAZING) and I had the strawberry sunrise smoothie. After I had those two I felt energized and ready to take on my 3 hour drive! This was a great place to stop and eat! My husband had the hashtag breakfast sandwich and kale champ smoothie. We both agreed my drink and sandwich were better but his was good too. You definitely have to smother the hashtag breakfast sandwich with maple syrup! YUM!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for Vegan options! I was able to bring 5 friends with me and everyone could find something they liked instead of having to eat at separate restaurants (which is important because we are on vacation here in Vegas!). The food was so good! And it's the perfect brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Love Tiabi.  They have the best waffles and coffee drinks. Really nice staff too.  Come here once a week."}
{"text":"The place has a really nice vibe to it. Very laid back, but the wait was a little too long. My girlfriend and I waited for at least 20 minutes for two sandwiches and a shake. The sandwiches and their prices were good, but they weren't that very filling for a person who is hungry. I'd like to come back here, but maybe on a slow day or when I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! Staff and environment are very welcoming and friendly. The Velvet latte is delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered skinny pistachio latte, it was so good with the waffle on top , a small joint .  The pictures looked lot fancier than the actual place tho."}
{"text":"Great tasting, beautiful presentation. Bananatella and strawberry kisses.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I do like this place, but I docked another star because of a recent time I came in, and it was not too busy (there were three customers sitting down at two different tables) and me standing at the register. It took almost a few minutes before someone even acknowledged me, although the girl who finally took my order was apologetic. Also, today we came in and were told we couldn't order food because of a catering order they have. I do love the honey cream latte and waffle sandwiches, and the owner is really nice."}
{"text":"We have been making it a point to visit here every single time we visit Las Vegas since the place opened. And this trip we decided to check out their newest location in North Las Vegas and it did not disappoint. Although it is just a bit smaller than their number one location it is still a friendly clean comfortable place with fantastic food and excellent service. This will always be our family's favorite place to go together."}
{"text":"Eat breakfast here with the wife a couple times a month.  If you want a sweet treat get a Tiffs waffle macchiato.  It's got a churro waffle wedge on top."}
{"text":"Best Waffle House in Las Vegas! Incredible creations and unbelievable tasting waffles. I am so glad I came here for breakfast! Think I'll return for lunch with my daughter and try a waffle sandwich! And I must try the waffle macchiato which I regret not ordering after I saw one served up!"}
{"text":"I love the service and I especially love their churro waffle I usually add in some of their ice cream. I've tried their sandwiches and plenty of their deserts my second best would have to be their strawberry and kisses if I'm not mistaken. I can't wait to go again and order that churro waffle."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that such a highly rated Yelp restaurant was offering a deal on LivingSocial. I knew I just had to get it and try the place out.

I ordered the Mixed Berry Chicken Salad. It came with two yummy waffles. The salad itself was fresh, lots of fruits and chicken to fill you up. The waffles itself reminded me of the HK egg waffle taste, except not as sweet.

For my drink I ordered a Dirty Mocha Chai. It came in a cute mason jar cup. I could mostly taste the mocha but not so much the chai. It was a good drink but don't think I will get it again.

Can't wait to come back and try some of their waffle desserts!"}
{"text":"When I entered, no one greeted me. There were at least 5 people on the floor. I looked at the menu for 3 or so minutes when someone finally said they'll be right with me. I ordered their waffle macchiato because it sounded delicious. It's supposed to have a cinnamon sugar waffle garnish.

It took a while to make the drink which it fine. It's hand crafted, blah blah blah, but then he handed it to me without the waffle and he said, \"the waffle will be right out. I just don't want the espresso to expire.\"   why not give me the full effect and make it correctly? Why not wait until the waffle is ready? The lack of urgency and receiving a deconstructed version of what I ordered - killed it for me. 

The drink wasn't bad, not great, but not bad & the customer service needs some help."}
{"text":"OK, this is a lengthy review.  here's a summary:  The wait is FOREVER.  If you're disabled or in a hurry, skip it.  If you're fully-abled with plenty of time on your hands, Tiabi is probably worth the wait.

Now for the actual review:

This place is very popular - there wasn't an empty seat in the house.  This is a problem for me as I'm disabled.  I was feeling halfway decent today and decided to take my daughter out for a (long overdue) mommy/daughter date, since I don't get to do that very often.

We went inside and stared at the menu for a few minutes.  It's big and on the wall near the front of the store, which is convenient.  After deciding what we wanted, I walked around to find the area for placing an order.  There are 3 sections where the counter is open, so they all appear to be there for communicating with the people behind the counter.  After examining the other items at the counter (there's stuff everywhere), however, it wasn't obvious where to stand to place an order.  One of the staff members saw the lost look on my face and directed me to the right place.  Once there I noticed an ipad on the counter which I assume they use to take orders.

We moved to the appropriate counter spot (which is at the front of the store, by the menu), and then waited to be helped.  I was able to wait for 10 minutes, but that's when my back issues kicked in.  In that time, we were given an apology, but no other eye contact or acknowledgement.  I got the impression that they were overwhelmed and didn't WANT to take anymore orders.  I've worked in retail and food service, so I know how that that is.  It was probably a blessing that they didn't take my order, as I wouldn't have been capable of standing around much longer to wait for the food.

In their defense, all 3 employees were shuffling around and working very hard.  The place was just seriously understaffed.  They could've used AT LEAST 2 more people today.  Since my back issues don't allow me to stand for extended periods of time, I hate to say that I won't be able to return to this establishment.  For anyone in the same boat - having limited physical abilities - I'd suggest ordering Tiabi for delivery if you live close enough, or just try a different waffle bar.  The one at Tivoli has plenty of seating and wasn't busy when I went.

I was very disappointed.  My young daughter was VERY excited to try some new and desserty waffles.  It kills me to get that far into the process, only to break her heart and go somewhere else.  It also sucks because I'm usually in too much pain (or too medicated) to even leave the house.  So when I do leave the house, every minute counts and is very special to me.  Don't take your good health for granted!!!!!!!!

Not entirely related, but worth noting:  Across the street from Tiabi, the wash runs between Toys R Us and Seafood City.  This part of the wash spawns a lot of water pokemon, which are hard to find elsewhere in the desert.

I kinda wish I could leave a review without giving a star rating.  Although I couldn't try the food, it's obviously good.  They wouldn't have been that busy if they weren't doing something right.  I just REALLY REALLY REALLY wish the owners would staff it better, or maybe expand or something.  We aren't all fully-abled college students with the ability to wait around all day.  I also want to mention that I'm NOT the type of person who expects everyone to cater to ME and my specific needs.  My belief - no matter what side of the counter I'm on - is that if your customers are important to you, you don't make them wait more than 2 minutes to be rung up."}
{"text":"First time coming here, let me tell you I'm freaking in love. This place is waaayy underrated & so cheap. I love the atmosphere, the guy who took our order was helpful & very welcoming. I'll for sure be coming back on my next day off! I wish there were more of these than Starbucks or Dunkins.  I love Tiabi"}
{"text":"Great place for waffles and coffee
Definitely have to go with the waffledilla
Yummy flavor
Convenient location
Got the iced coffee"}
{"text":"This place makes me miss my vacation to Las Vegas so much....the food is beyond amazing and the pricing is reasonable.

The smoothies are absolutely delightful and has really gotten me to eat healthier by making me crave their smoothies all the time and finding the need to learn to make it myself in order to satisfy that craving.

The waffles are so good, both sweet and salty. However, I think I might be more hooked on the salty waffle sandwiches. Its a bit sweet from the waffle itself but overall it is just warm and had a nice balance of fluffy and chewy."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and stopped in since we saw a groupon and we were glad we did! I got the banana Nutella and upgraded it to a Belgium and it was super yummy! My husband got the break the fast which was also really good. I got the red velvet drink and my husband got the pumpkin pie spice drink and both were good. We went around 1 on a Saturday and there wasn't many others in the restaurant, but the service was friendly and helpful and the food was fresh"}
{"text":"I used to work around that area and I hated going to fast food restaurants, that's obviously not healthy for us. Thank God I found this place. It is so delicious. I loved going there. Too bad I do not live around there and always wanted to go to their location in Nlv but never had a chance.  
-they are super friendly! 
-fresh ingredients!!!!!
-different 
-LOVE the atmosphere, it is super relaxing. 
-local business 
-Just perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Wish they had a location in or near spring valley. The wait time is a bit long, however I understand due to amount of people eating or ordering. Very happy with this waffle house. 4 stars only because pricing is a bit higher than we'd like as well as distance."}
{"text":"I had a groupon so I kinda went all out.  I ordered the Country Chick Sandwich with avacado, chips and a green tea, a chicadilla, the cinnamon sugar waffles, and the wafflenut with Nutella and almonds-- OMG I'm full!  This place is pretty awesome.  Definitely not a dieting place though lol... Their waffles have got to be one of the best I've tried.  Served up fresh and warm, the waffles are nice and crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside.  Loved it.  

It's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland in the Target complex.  Really chill environment.  Great for breakfast or lunch, or maybe a snack or dessert.  There were 2 girls behind the counter cooking and taking orders.  Super friendly staff.  I think they have wifi, because a lot of college students look like they were meeting to get work done.  

Definitely enjoyed this place.  I just wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Love the pistachio latte and waffledilla. The staff is great. I always feel welcome. My 8 month old loves everything she's tried. 

There's always people having meetings in here. Really a great place to catch up with friends, people watch a little, and waste some time."}
{"text":"Just passing by and stop to have branch here. Great place with good prices. Polite and nice waiters. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place! The word TIABI stands for to inspire and be inspired. I love this place for so many reasons. They have fresh juice smoothies, vegan options and WAFFLES! Yes I am conscious about being healthy but I do have a sweet tooth and this place gives me both! Plus the owners and workers are super nice which makes me want to come and hang out more often. 

My favorites:
Peanut butter banana smoothie
Vegan Belgian waffles with the toppings of your choice! 
Vegan kale chocolate chip ccookies!

This place is still pretty new so I can tell they are adding and changing the menu due to demand.. Love it! 
They have everything non-vegan as well so you can enjoy the place with vegans and non-vegans ;)"}
{"text":"I bought the Groupon and was not ever disappointed with any of the waffle choices and even the sandwich was delicious. The coconut with basil was very refreshing and the staff was very nice. I have already taken two friends and will continue to recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place and it was amazing!! I got the bananatella waffles and the strawberry sunrise smoothie (I believe it was called). It honestly tasted like heaven. The wait was about 15-20minutes long but it was worth the wait!! Also, the environment is so peaceful like and super cute. I totally recommend trying this place out, especially if you're looking for a place to chill, study while having coffee or simply to have some good tasty snack like food!!"}
{"text":"Super enthusiastic & excitable staff.  They were excited to know that we're local (I'm British so easy to assume I'm a tourist.)  Completely sold us on the Vegan Choc Chip Cookies and even brought out a free sample before we dove in. The people working there today are a real credit to the shop and the owners should be proud to have such devoted staff.

Onto the food, we got the Guru Burger on Ciabatta & Vegas Wafflewich.  It was amazing, enough said.

Verdict: We'll be back...."}
{"text":"Fluffy,  crunchy and delicious.  Breakfast,  lunch and snacks .. Coffee and smoothie specials. Island reggae music playing in the backyard.  Wonderful service,  and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Very small Hipster cafe in the middle of a busy street and plaza feels very downtown inside with the art on the wall and parking the chalk board menu the whole set up ..:.i had the pistachio latte hot (gave it to me kind of cold ) but it was delish not too sweet. 
Waffle Wednesday !!!! It's BOGO day on their Classic waffles so yea I took advantage of the deal ! 
The Waffles were big but not thick (good because I wanted a morning snack not too many calories lol ) 
#1 waffle =Butter Pecan omg omg omg still making my mouth water a bit . 
#2 waffle : strawberry with chocolate drizzle and whip cream also very good but man that butter pecan !!!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice. Food was mediocre. My sister ordered a drink hot, they made it iced. Not a huge variety of hot tea, kind of bummed that they serve \"Stash\" brand. Really wish they had something unique or leafs in tea pot. Maybe would go back, but maybe not. Was really hoping for more."}
{"text":"I live 6 minutes away from this place and I just happened to run into this place. When we first entered, we were instantly greeted. The guy at the the register asked if it was our first time, and it was. So he gave us a few minutes to decide, we asked a few questions and he recommended us a few things off the menu. After we ordered, the food took no longer than 10 mins for everything to come. Plus free wifi (can't say no to that lol). The food was great, enviornment was great and the staff is great. I will definitely come back here and try the other drinks and food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the waffles here.  I've tried the Belgian waffle Kisses and my sister's classic waffle banana nutella.  They're both so delicious!  My sister and I can't get enough of their waffles.  Their coffees are good quality too.  Usually, I don't expect much in regards to the quality of coffee.  However, every drink we've ordered is made fresh from their espresso machine, so no acidic after taste here.  Their customer is always excellent!  Very friendly and nice!

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome waffle for breakfast. The maple and bacon. Not a very thick waffle but it was delicious and I was satisfied. Friend of mine had the Elvis one with peanut butter bacon and bananas. Loved it as well. a great find!!!"}
{"text":"Jay gave us much needed guidance through their awesome looking menu (too many good choices). Stoked for this waffledia lunch combo, pecan butter waffle, ube oreo ice cream."}
{"text":"Love this place! I found it via Yelp and went to grab breakfast for a large group. The java jolt coffee was very smooth, but on the light side. I also ordered a few breakfast waffles with turkey sausage as well as bacon, and the zombie red velvet waffle with bacon and chocolate sauce. Everything was very good! I thought the zombie red velvet waffle was missing bacon, but they put a thin slice inside the waffle pocket. While waiting for the food to be prepped, I wanted to order another coffee, but didn't. The owners are very friendly as well. Definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time last week and will definitely be coming back.  I ordered a large Tiff's Waffle Macchiato.  Compared to other coffee shops, the menu at Tiabi is reasonably priced.  My large macchiato was $4.75, and it came with a churro waffle. The macchiato was delicious and had a prominent coffee flavor while also tasting sweet from the caramel and vanilla.  I wish the churro waffle contained more cinammon sugar just like an actual churro, but it was still good.

I loved how there were playing cards at the sit down tables, and my friend and I ended up staying way longer than we expected from playing a game of cards."}
{"text":"WAFFLES + AMAZING STAFF = Why are you not here already? Selene (sp?) was terrific... She has great energy and was very friendly along with the rest of the staff! Customer service is very important to me and they nailed it. 

The texture of the waffles was so so perfect. Soft on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside. I ordered the hashtag and was pretty sad when there was no more left after I engulfed it all. The ambiance was also nice- upbeat music and fun art on the walls.

Definitely an excellent choice for a cheat meal or any day!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to try it out since it appears to be the only breakfast place on yelp that's not on the strip. Causal vibe, friendly staff, delicious waffles and their pistachio latte is delicious! If you are in the mood for waffles, this might be the place for you. Pictures of waffles to come later!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The staff, Tiffany & Yanel in particular, were super helpful in helping my family and I order since it was our first time. They answered our questions and explained the menu to each of us. Will definitely return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place is yummylicious! I would recommend this place!  My daughter loved her pumpkin churro waffle and we enjoyed the west coast waffle sandwich!"}
{"text":"Tiabi Coffee & Waffle is a hole in the wall venue that I am glad I got to visit during my short stay in Nevada. My family and I make a semi annual trip from CA every year...and we usually always settle for the renowned hotel buffets. This time however I decided to change that, and we stumbled on this location for breakfast.

I was fascinated with the originality of their menu, especially with waffles. Savory or sweet...many different options were available to satisfy. I appreciated that this restaurant was vegan friendly for my own personal choice. But my family loved it as well. Although a little pricey, the food we ordered  was indeed very filling and delicious. Anticipate an average wait time as they make the vegan waffles by scratch. 

The restaurant itself had a very welcoming cafe environment. And the employees were kind. 

I highly recommend the visit and the try the Waffledilla and the Twilight Lavender Latte! Heaven!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was perfect! It was just the right amount of cozy and chill, and the noise level was just right. The brew of the day was Guatemalan which I loved because I could drink it black. It wasn't too bitter and I felt it was sweeter then most other beans. I had the hashtag breakfast which was tasty. The waffle had a good balance of softness and crunchy. I also had a side of chips which I believe were barbecue flavor and it was way better than the Lay's ones. 10/10 would want to come here again to try their other items like the normal waffles or the dessert waffle taco."}
{"text":"This place an absolute delight. Staff was friendly and food was delicious. Had the bananutella waffle and a coconut truffle iced coffee. Will be going again!!"}
{"text":"It has a very unusual menu...My husband and I are seniors and this is in a UNLV neighborhood by Target so we are not their usual clientele.  But, if they come to Henderson I am there.  They have waffles for every kind of meal from breakfast to dinner.  I had the bacon waffle and my husband had the Western waffle (chicken bacon avocado etc) and their coffee is excellent and he had lemon ginger tea.  Kids would love that place.  The only thing that keeps us from giving it the 5th star is that it is too small and the tables and chairs are not that comfortable and really no décor...so you are there primarily for their menu and they don't let you down there.  

PS...if you order something that requires butter, have them butter it.  Those little butter things are a bugger to open and they said they don't mind pre buttering for you."}
{"text":"I came here for a meet up with friends and hour both a waffle sandwich and a desert waffle. The sandwich (cali one) was tasty as can be. It had a great chipotle style sauce. It truly stole the show. However, my desert waffle (kisses)looked 10 times better than it tasted. The waffle was way too crunchy. 

Needless to say, my overall experience was fantastic. I had very little wait time to receive my food. The staff was nice and always smiling. The place was clean, cute, and comfortable. It really wasnt with complaining about the overcooked waffle because at that point I was pretty full. To full to eat a perfect one.

Definitely go check this place out if you are a Lesley Knope!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp while I was sitting in the car and wanted something sweet .... 

It's in the shopping center with the target on the side 

The ladies working were very friendly and nice took my order right away I ordered the kisses waffle and the snickers coffee both were yummy :) I would come back to try out other items they have breakfast waffles as well if you don't want something sweet you are in luck don't worry"}
{"text":"Love the food, drinks, and service! Tiff's waffle Macchiato is a must every time I am in town! We brought the kids out today and they loved it too! #vivalaselvis"}
{"text":"This is a great coffee and waffles cafe if you want something unique and delicious. I've tried almost every coffee and they're all good but the Twilight Lavender and Pistachio are my personal favorites. Prices are lower than any other place I've been and the employees are really nice."}
{"text":"Great food! I got the strawberry and chocolate waffle. I also tried to lemonade which has a slushie in it. People were nice.


Only downside was all the silverware out for customers to use was dirty. We had to request take out silverware as a result ."}
{"text":"Super dank peach green tea! The cold brew is also dank. Didn't try a waffle but they looked good!"}
{"text":"I like coming here in during the week in the mornings because it's chill. The owners are cool and the food/drinks here are great! 

This past weekend, I took my cousin who was visiting from So Cal to try out the food/coffee. It was my first time seeing the other workers at the shop..

I was shocked to experience a customer having to clean a table for her and her family  when it clearly is not a customer's job to do so. The customer asked a worker for a wet rag so she can wipe down a table that had not been cleaned and still had dishes from the last customer who sat there. Four stars because the worker actually handed her a wet rag. Wtf who does that? 

Then, not too long after that, I experience an angry customer storm out because nobody was at the cash register taking orders. C'mon guys, get it together."}
{"text":"I LOVE Tiabi! I'm vegan so whenever I visit Las Vegas my options are very limited. Luckily Tiabi is so veg-friendly! Their waffles are great, the staff is friendly, five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day before class and it was a little hard to find at first, but the atmosphere is great and the chocolate coconut iced latter was wonderful! I didn't get a chance to have a waffle but they smelled great. Wifi is secure which is nice, but a little loud if you're trying to study"}
{"text":"We decided to go off the strip for breakfast this morning and I was looking for a good vegan fare. We stumbled upon this restaurant. It was great! Great service and even better food. They did take a little while to cook but their waffles are 100% vegan. One of the servers forgot my side of chips but besides that everything was great!   Next time in Vegas,  we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great waffle sandwiches.  Great prices.  Nice place to hang out in Vegas that ISN'T a Starbucks."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, easy parking, delicious menu of waffles, waffle sandwiches, and coffee! Employees are very nice too!"}
{"text":"The waffledilla wasn't worth the money. Coffee was meh. Seating is not great. But it wasn't awful."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, but the drinks are awesome. A good selection and all made with the best ingredients and care. The waffles are, just OK. Nothing spectacular, but OK. The chips, meh. I let them be... not really worth it. We tried a couple of things. The Viva Las Elvis was good, but another meh. I loved getting off the strip and trying something a little more local, but with all of the options in Vegas... this just doesn't quite cut it. Go if you want a good Chai Tea or Smoothie. The staff is definitely friendly, but I wouldn't recommend it for a meal."}
{"text":"So I got myself the waffldella.  Who was the first time there surprise my wife was a red velvet waffle"}
{"text":"It's sooo good that I can find a place have such special coffee I never try waffle with avocado before it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop near my house. In a really great area with great music and a great atmosphere. Interesting food options as most of it includes waffles as a burger or sandwich or an open faced waffle. I love that they offer student discounts and discounts for checking in on Yelp on top of that. If you write the review you got a free iced coffee or iced tea. Also have really great vegan smoothies with protein and nice coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Waffles are good, would've liked a side but they only give a circle of egg which looks like it was supposed to be on a sandwich.."}
{"text":"When I went the second time things were missing on my to go order. I spoke to someone one the phone and she told me she would take care of the next time I went. Then when I went back I told the snobby girl about my things that were missing, and she says well that's a lot of things for you to forget, well I'm not the one making the food to go and bagging it so that was not my problem, so she acts like I'm begging her for a cookie, chips, and the waffle side that comes with the tiffs coffee. I tell her to forget about it, then she tells me it'll take 30 min for my order to be ready so I told her never mind and she has the nerve to give a 10% off for a future purchase which to me it was a joke.  I was not asking for a discount I just wanted the items I had paid for that were not in the bag. The customer service was very poor, how is it my fault things are not in my bag when I'm not the one behind the counter, you have the technology to keep track of orders and is not being used. I would never step a foot here again and waste my time."}
{"text":"We came here as an alternative to the constant rape and pillaging that we felt the hotels were offering and what a great option.  They make the waffles fresh and the coffees were great!  Came here twice for breakfast during our four day stay.  Tried the snicker iced coffee and pistachio latte.  Snickers ice coffee is the way to go.  Then we had the Viva la elvis, west coast, thai basil, and banana nutella.  All were good but I did think the viva elvis was very unique since they had bacon, banana, and peanut butter together on the waffle.  This place is in the Target shopping center at the corner of Maryland and Flamingo.  It has weird entrances to the mall but as long as you head for target you will this place around the corner."}
{"text":"Solid food - interesting menu and concept with traditional waffles, sweet and savory waffles, waffle sandwiches and all things waffle.  Quality of food is very high with very good quality ingredients, and super friendly staff.  UNLV location and staff/ownership with UNLV connections is a major plus - they appear very committed to UNLV and the general community.  Great to see good quality, creative and fun places like Tiabi develop in this neighborhood, which benefits from this type of energy and creativity.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are coming for Belgium style DON'T they stop serving them over a month ago due to taking too long to cook according to the staff. 

My wife LOVES breakfast so I found this place for her. The atmosphere on a weekday morning is quiet and empty but I hear on the weekends it is a madhouse. 

We shared everything today. We started with a maple bacon waffle. I really liked it but my wife said it tasted like an eggo waffle. 

We both had a west coast sandwich despite it being \"breakfast\". Both really good. Warm waffle as the bread and creamy avocado with bacon and chicken unside-Yum!

We also both had coffee. I had a honey cream iced latte- awesome! My wife had a regular latte with sugar free caramel-also awesome! There coffee is amazing. No bitterness in our milk drinks for sure. 

Overall we loved this place. Great coffee and pretty decent food. Me: 5/5. Wife:4/5. I round down. 

We will be returning for sure!

Btw it is counter service but it was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Love coming here for their churro waffle! . Always put some sort of drizzle with whipped cream! . Incredible. And it's a good place to have breakfast with friends or significant other. 
The food is always good. But I just can't get into their coffee. I've tried a few different ones and not a fan of any of them."}
{"text":"Quaint and cute, definitely a better option than big chain coffee shops. The coffee is out of this world and the food is delicious. The baristas? Definitely top notch!"}
{"text":"Found them next to our favorite sushi place. Delicous red velvet waffles with a pistachio latte.. yes please."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Absolutely delicious! I had the vegan Elvis waffle and I ate every last bit. I also had a house coffee. The staff is super friendly and you can tell that they truly care about customer satisfaction. Next time I'm in town I am definitely stopping back by. Awesome!"}
{"text":"It was my first time today and  their coffee was great, but the guy who was working there didn't offer me a punch card to get free coffee. He mentioned it to other customers which was rude of him. I plan to go on the Maryland location instead maybe they will offer a loyalty card."}
{"text":"Flat out the best waffles in town. They have an awesome selection of sweet and savoury waffles that will leave you wanting to come back. As I did multiple times."}
{"text":"This place was delish! They have savory and sweet options for the waffles. Fresh ingredients and vegan options to make you feel like it's healthy lol. The coffee is also super good- this is a nice friendly artsy local coffee spot to check out when in Las Vegas. The staff was super friendly and helpful when we asked for some directions! Really went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning because it looked like something different.

First off the coffee was great. Super delicious & flavorful! I had the honey cream latte and couldn't have been happier with my choice! Perfect amount of coffee and sweet. Yummmmmm!!!!! 

There is practically nowhere to sit so we had to wait for people to get up and we felt kinda like vultures. I know this is not an issue as space is something that cannot be helped and I did not take it into consideration in my rating but I want to make mention of it in case you plan on dining in.

Ashley and I shared the breakfast sandwich and the Honey I'm Home churro waffle. 

The breakfast sandwich was bland. Not very much flavor. Even the bacon wasn't bacony enough to save the dish. It was just \"meh...\". Added salt and pepper...still \"meh\". 

The churro waffle however! We should have gotten 2 of these. It wasn't overly sweet like I thought it might be, but the balance was harmonious. The waffle was warm and cinnamony and the honey brought just the perfect flavor to marry everything together. I will definitely be back for this. Perhaps several times..."}
{"text":"They have the best waffles! Tried their waffles with peanut butter and it was bomb! service was great. i definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I had a maple bacon waffle and it was amazing! However I thought the portion was a little small. I think it's the best waffle I've ever had. Period."}
{"text":"Food is really good! However, the service is very time consuming  tuxedo frappe was amazing along with the Tokyo wafflewich! Definitely come by and enjoy one of their wafflewiches if you have the time!"}
{"text":"Simple, tasty, inexpensive. At under $10 a person, my whole family enjoyed breakfast here, despite needing to push two small tables together to sit the five of us. Would recommend the banannatella waffle, twilight lavender drink was great, as was oolong tea. Staff were friendly and helpful. Inside could use a bit of sprucing up, and the location isn't the best, but I'm a fan nonetheless."}
{"text":"I heard from some people in the neighborhood that a new waffle place opened up right down the street on Flamingo & Maryland Pky, so I had to try!

It's a small order at the counter type of place, but everything is reasonably priced (use a Yelp! check-in to get 15% off, or UNLV students get a discount as well!)  The special here is waffles done in all sorts of ways (with toppings, or as a sandwich in some cases).  

I went with a waffle with almonds, bananas and Nutella on it for about $6.  The taste of it was OK, presented and cooked well, but nothing too special about the batter.  The disadvantage was it took what seemed like forever to get it (maybe just because I was hungry?).  I also got a hot chocolate which was just so-so.

For the price it's a wonderful place, and it's close to Target so I could see coming here for brunch and doing some shopping, I know I'll be back, but the location and low pricing is the main driver."}
{"text":"This is an adorable little coffee shop!!
You really feel the love for the bean while you are here!

The french press coffee was SO GOOD! It made me want to go out and buy one!
But having one here is way more fun!!

The lattes and espresso were amazing as well.
Watching them swirl your latte into a beautiful drinkable piece of art! 
And tastes so good! Amazing!!

Oh....And don't say no to the Waffles! Made to order delish!
Love Tiabi!! It is a really special place!

And the owner Tiffany told me they are getting ready to open a roastery too!
Take my money! I can't wait! I hope they have 5lb bags!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've gone twice and every time, the food and coffee are on point. Service is banging. You really can't go wrong. I love their vegan options and just the simplicity of the place, waffles."}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast club waffle sandwich, this was very good.  Meats  had the right balance of flavor with the waffle.  Nicely done, good staff, and a fair price."}
{"text":"I'd say the quality of food make this place a 4 but today, overall, it was a weak 3. I arrived at 12pm with a family of 4 who was already eating.  

I ordered the Vegan WaffleWhich which is a waffle with some spring mix, avocado and Tomato with their special sauce. Already they were out of avocado but they made amends by giving me a complimentary fruit cup. This was good and I'd get it again. 

Also had a Golden Waffle which is a plain waffle with powder sugar and butter. 

It took 20 minutes for them to get me this order when it really should have only taken 10 and the fruit they had was not ready. It needed to be cut up. I'm all for freshness but it seems like this place doesn't have a good prep strategy. I did see, however they may have had a take out order they were tending to but there was 3 people there and only 2 customers after my brother and I. Keep in mind this place only makes waffles and my waffle wasn't even warm when I got it. 
I will be trying this place again, as it was good food and the staff was friendly and accommodating but I would prefer better experience next time and it would be as easy as the staff having better prep."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast sandwich and substituted the bacon for avocado. It was a dry waffle with a side of smelted cheese, 3 tiny slices of avocado and frozen eggs than were disgusting."}
{"text":"(Longer review to come)

Tiabi is a much welcomed oasis in the hectic rush of Las Vegas. We tried the Savory Thai Basil and West Coast waffle sandwiches. Both were absolutely delightful - crispy on the outside and filled with fresh ingredients on the inside. We'll definitely have to try the sweeter waffles and drinks that they're known for. If you're a visitor to the city, it's worth the (very quick) drive to make it here. Much tastier and less soggy than Bruxie on the Strip."}
{"text":"They wrap up bacon, cheese, chicken, and veggies in a waffle. This really should be all you need to know about this place to make you want to eat here. But, I'll expand. They wrap bacon, cheese, chic...

I decided I needed a pick-me-up and Tiabi popped up on my coffee radar (the yelp app) and I headed that way. As I parked my car and walked towards the door, I became skeptical about this place considering this neighbor can be non-friendly at times. I walked in and did the classic Hanna-Barbera/ Scooby Doo surprised look. This place was clean, inviting, and I was greeted with a giant smile and brief intro on the place. Great way to start my waffle fueled experience.  

I ordered the, \"West Coast Waffle Wafflewich\" and the \"Stiles Java Jolt\". The \"West Coast\", I was told is the fan favorite and if you read what I wrote above, that's easy to believe. This sammie is big, about half the size of an average dinner plate. The tasty ingredients are added to the savory waffle, then folded over to immediately give you this pocket-like snack item. As I ate, I was afraid of two things; all of the food falling out of the opposite biting side, and a weird sweet waffle paired with cheese. My fears waffled away as the crunch of the bacon filled my ears, the tender & juicy chicken, cheese, and veggies came together in the warm waffle. This sandwich was fantastic, and turned out to be one of those food items you realize you haven't put down since the first bite. This Wafflicious sammie was paired with seasoned homemade waffle chips. Fantastic mutated breakfast/ lunch combo.

The Stiles Java Jolt was delicious. Espresso, coffee, and just a tad of vanilla flavoring. I went half on the flavoring, because I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but Normally it comes with four pumps of vanilla. I could have drank two more of these delicious caffeinated bullets, but then I might turn into Spider-Man and climb the walls."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles and coffee, but bad decor. They need an upgrade. 

Yes I'm all about the whole experience. The look, the feel, the food."}
{"text":"Finally after the longest time being in my bookmarks, I got to try this place today!! Located in the shopping center on the corner of Maryland Pkwy & Flamingo with the Target, next to Sakana. Clean and spacious on the inside and I like that they had playing cards on the tables, feels like a place you could spend an hour or two catching up with friends.

I was pretty surprised at how large their drink and food menus were! They have coffee based drinks, frappes, smoothies, teas, and other non-coffee drinks. Cool selections like Red Velvet, Chocolate Coconut, Honey Cream Latte, Java Jolt, Kale Smoothie & Raspberry Lemonade! Tons of different options! My boyfriend and I settled on the Chocolate Coconut Latte and non blended White Chocolate Tuxedo. The Coconut one had some coffee but I'm pretty sure the White Chocolate one didn't. Great flavors but I was expecting them to be more coffee based. The White Chocolate Tuxedo tasted Iike a World Class Chocolate ice cream shake from Baskin Robbins! Both super tasty and an amazing price at $3.75 & $4. Score!

Now the food items! Waffles, waffle sandwiches, salads and desserts! I was also pretty suprised at the amount of vegan items they had! I think I counted about 9 options for food, Awesome! We settled on the West Coast waffle sandwich. Oh and all waffle sandwiches can be substituted with ciabatta bread. It came with chicken, tiabi sauce (vegan aioli), avocado, bacon, cheese and tomato. I was expecting some tiny thing but it was kind of around the size of a 6 in' sub. And for $5.99! Perfect! The waffle was nice and fluffy, had great flavors, and filling!

Our bill for the three items was $17.84 (including tax & 20% tip)! I will definitely be back especially since it's near UNLV. Thank goodness as I was getting tired of all the Chipotle-styled bowl & burrito places. Yummo!"}
{"text":"A great little hideaway for when you are in the neighborhood! Nothing like stuffing your face at Roberto's for breakfast and coming here after for a nice coffee while you work. 

Friendly service. 
Free wi-fi
Free water to go with your coffee
Excellent words of wisdom in the bathroom for you to collect.

Quite barren on the decor, so Tiabi lacks that comfort and welcoming aspect. Would come back as the owner was super helpful on helping me pick/customize a coffee that would not be too sweet!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit here I try something new, I have never been disappointed! The wafflewich is a must try! I love how fresh everything is made, I leave with a sweet satisfied feeling every time. I like the vegan/vegetarian options as well. Friendly and helpful staff keep a positive atmosphere, one of the reasons I really like this place"}
{"text":"I saw a groupon so I bought it & so glad I did! It sits in a plaza, parking was easy. I ordered the West Coast sandwich & a smoothie, the waffle bread exceeded my expectation, it had a little crunchy outside & when you took a bite it was soft and filled with lovely flavors, just the way I like a sandwich so deeeelish & the portion size is perfect! I will stop in here any time I'm in the area, even if not hungry, I'll take home for later. Can't wait to bring my family & friends here!"}
{"text":"The golden waffle was okay as was the Strawberry Sunrise. No major kudos are due; they made a vegan waffle that was decent but not at all thrilling."}
{"text":"Last time I was here I got the red velvet waffles and they were amazing. I really like the atmosphere, they have games and the inside is nicely decorated. It is kind of hard to see from the street, it's too bad because I feel like they deserve way more customers. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Must try: # Tiff's Waffle Macchiato! Yummy coffee. Nice people. The wafflewiches are good too!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Hubby and I shared 3 different waffle sandwiches this morning and all 3 were phenomenal! We will definitely be back... There are so many more menu options to try! Not to mention coffees and smoothies... Gotta try the kale champ smoothie... So good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with plenty of vegan options. The smoothies and specialty coffee drinks are also great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This Was My First Time Here At This Location and The Two Girls Working Helped Me With The Menu And Also Recomended Some Items For Me. i Ended Up Getring The West Coast Wafflewich. Sooo Good. The Food Is Light And Fresh,You Dont Feel Bloated Or Tired After Eating Eat. I Will Most Def Be Coming Back"}
{"text":"I ate here alone a few days ago and as far as customer service goes they were great! The lady at the front was very personable and actually conversed with me personally. Most places ask you what you want and want to get on with their day, but it's nice to walk into a restaurant for the first time and get acknowledged like they are happy you chose them as a place to eat today. It was a very cute/creative place. I love how there are cards at all the tables. I will have to bring my boyfriend just for that! Lol. I ordered the guru burger. (Vegan) and it was  interesting. I tasted the waffle and burger and it was weird at first but not gross. I definitely will go back. There is a few smoothies I would like to try."}
{"text":"All the outlets to plug your devices are gone."}
{"text":"This is located a few minutes away from UNLV. We came to study after class and check it out. The smell when you walk in... is dangerous. I can imagine it being something similar to heaven's scent. The music isn't too loud... it could be better but some of it was decent. 

We were greeted at the counter by a very nice young man. He was knowledgeable and gave us great suggestions. They have a variety of vegan options in both coffee lattes and waffles. We chose the Java Jolt and the dark chocolate lavender latte both with almond milk. They were great and I would highly recommend. Both were priced like any other coffee house in Vegas, nothing outrageous and totally fair. 

We ordered dessert to go... vegan the cinnamon churro waffle with vegan vanilla ice cream. It was so amazing. The ice cream was like nothing I've ever experienced. The waffle was made perfectly. We put it in the microwave to make it extra warm and soft, since we took it to go... and it was just so amazing. I can not wait to go back and get it again. If you've never been here, I definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Definitely one of my fav coffee shoppes to go to. They serve great coffees & teas as well as some delicious food. Really cute place to just hang out & in a convenient central location."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when ordering the churro waffle, vegan ice cream, and baconut. I absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"Coffee was good.... Waffles were cold and hard. It wasn't what I expected. My husband got the breakfast sandwich on a waffle, that was good. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"I came in to tiabi today and wasnt sure what to expect considering the last time i was here i wasnt a coffee fan... but i checked in got 10 percent off got a iced coffee with hazelnut and almond milk and a bananatella waffle which im telling you guys rocked my world... BEST WAFFLE EVER!  i will be back cause that waffle will be in my dreams lol do yourself a favor and come in!"}
{"text":"Got a new addiction! Mae's Sweet Dream! I've got to ALWAYS have that along w/my order! LOL BUT here's Wut I also got for my dinner AND breakfast! The west coast for dinner & the Hashtag breakfast sandwich, my drink is Dom's Coffee Cake BZB!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. The owner was ridiculous!!! They were having a special on the pumpkin waffle and a Halloween waffle. I wanted the pumpkin waffle, which come in a Belgian waffle style. However, the owner informed me that she only had enough batter for the original or regular waffle in pumpkin. She attempted to make me get the Halloween waffle, but I did not want that. I requested the same style of the Belgian pumpkin order in a regular waffle style since they could not accommodate what was on the menu. She began to harp on charging me for glazed pecans because that  was how the original came. I told her why would she charge me considering they could not provide what was on the menu? She began discussing that the pecans cost $, and had an attitude the entire time. Also, we almost choked on smoke inhalation. While I support small businesses frequently, this was a mistake and I encourage anyone who wants polite, fast and great service to turn elsewhere.  Tiabi SUCKS and that's putting it lightly. Needless to say, we took our business to the Crab Corner. DON'T DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices, Great Staff. Can't really ask for more. I don't even really like Waffles in general, but I love eating the kinds that they make. They are really the kings in the Waffle game. Everyone there is real nice and the service was quick."}
{"text":"BOMB. I got churro waffle and wildberry lemonade on my way to the airport, and it made me want to stay another day! The churro waffle was perfect! Delightfully cinnamon-sugary, but not overwhelming. The thin-ness of the waffle makes it even and crunchy all the way across, and the fruit & whipped cream on were presented beautifully. Owner (?) was super patient, kind, and helpful, and even went back and printed a receipt when I forgot to ask for one initially. This place deserves to be way bigger and pricier than it is."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I got an avocado, bacon, lettuce and tomato waffle sandwich! It was great and just the right amount of food. Also got a coffee that came with these churro-esque waffles. Overall, friendly staff and had a cute atmosphere. Would definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"i got the Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich.

waffle was crisp but not hard, the eggs and sausage also tasted great.
the only reason i didnt give them a 5 is that the waffle is way too thick esp when stacked on top of each other to make a sandwich. this made it a little too hard to eat."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd be that impressed by a coffee shop that specializes in waffles and I was correct. I guess if you view it as a coffee shop first and a waffle shop second it's not so bad but I think most people that want breakfast want more options than just waffles. I tried the pistachio latte and build your own red velvet waffle with Thrifty ice cream and fruit. My boyfriend had an iced Americano and the bacon waffle sandwich. 

I was surprised to see that the coffee came in to-go cups even for a dine in order and I heard the couple behind me remark about the same thing. I guess if their menu shows pictures of fancy lattes with designs in a mug, that's what I expect to get. Regardless of presentation the coffee was quite good. I asked for skim milk and assuming they still used skim milk I found the latte to be very creamy with a nutty pistachio flavor that wasn't fake or overpowering. 

As for the waffles... they're just waffles ya know? My boyfriend's breakfast sandwich was pretty bland. If he hadn't added bacon to it it would have just consisted of scrambled eggs and shredded cheese. Adding the bacon added a bit of flavor but without drenching it in syrup it didn't taste like much of anything. Plus think about the texture of a waffle and scrambled eggs.. bacon is pretty much necessary for a crunch factor. My waffle was a little better, it had a bit of crunch on the edges and the red velvet was rich and gooey in the center. My favorite part was definitely the Thrifty ice cream though. I had a choice of strawberries and/or bananas for the fruit and I just got the strawberries. Overall it was a bit of a sugar overload and I can't see myself eating here very often if at all. Prices are definitely a little steep for what it really is. Not understanding the hype of this place at all."}
{"text":"Vegan waffles, light and crisp, topped with fresh fruit or syrup or other goodies.... A little place in a strip mall, which suited us perfectly, and we enjoyed a really great breakfast before our adventures.

We enjoyed the friendly service and the attention to the preparation - the fruit was arranged, not just thrown on.. 

Beautiful and delish - we shall return!"}
{"text":"Oh gezz I picked the perfect place for my waffle indulgence! Waffle is amazing, looks like a piece of art! Perfect hot coffee, great atmosphere. They even have playing cards at every table! Need to bring some friends next time!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11 am on a Sunday - not too busy with just one group in front of us and the tables were moderately filled. No matter how many people are here, be prepared to wait a looooooong time to get any food or drink. The restaurant itself reeks of old oil or some sort of thick grease smell that stays in your hair and clothes for hours after you leave.

Took 25 minutes to finally get my Tiff's Waffle Macchiato with a kind of cold, moderately crispy churro waffle. The drink itself was sweet and tasty, and the whipped cream is quite thick. But 25 minutes for a drink?? Way too long. 

10 minutes later, got the Red Velvet waffle w/ whipped cream, strawberries, and bananas. Boyfriend ordered the Waffledilla w/ avocado. Although good, it looked and tasted like something I could easily make at home in half the time.

People who came in after we ordered would order food to go and get it in 10 minutes or less. Some would then sit and eat inside. Maybe the key here is to order your food to go regardless of eating there or actually taking your food to go?

Will not be coming back due to the extremely slow service and decent quality food."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. The food tastes delicious and they have wifi, so I can study here. I introduced many of my family and friends to this place.

That being said, the service is below average. Not only is the wait time long (they only had 2 or 3 waffle makers, understandable bc they're a small mom and pop shop which I loved), but the owner/worker takes customer requests and suggestions personally. I asked for strawberries and Nutella on my waffle, as I always ordered it. When I received it, there were no strawberries. I hate to complain about food bc they have the power to spit in it when you're not looking, but I thought they'd be ok with me asking since I'd been there several times previously. When I asked, they took a few minutes and handed over a small bowl of sliced strawberries. I thought they were going to add it to my plate, so I brought it up to the counter. When she saw I did this, she grudgingly said,\"Oh, you wanted ME to put those on there?\" I replied that I could do it, a little embarrassed. 

The reason this was a red flag for me is because one of my earlier stops there, I heard the staff talking about a recent Yelp review. The review spoke of the bad service the customer received. The girl in question defended herself and stated she did nothing wrong. I didn't think anything of this the first time. A subsequent time I was there, a foreign couple (Italian accent?) was asking why their 2 waffles were not similar and if they could remake one because they enjoyed the crispier one. The same owner/worker who didn't take criticism well kept insisting that it was made the same and they just had to let it sit longer to get the crispy consistency. 

At that point, I hadn't been crossed by one of her moods yet, so I continued visiting to get my delicious coffee, waffles and to study. Then, that day hit as it inevitably would. I haven't returned since and don't intend to. Customer service is key, any business owner should know this. 

Since I know you (the owners) read the Yelp reviews, I'd like to offer up some constructive criticism: you should cater to your customers. If you take these comments personally and become defensive, your customers will only continue to be dissatisfied with your service."}
{"text":"This place is great! Today I had the west coast sandwich and it was amazing. One of the best sandwiches in the area. The chicken is perfect for the sandwich. And the waffle as bread is a cool idea. My girlfriend and I normally go in here for smoothies and this was the first time I ate food and I was not disappointed. The smoothies are really good as well the first time I had a smoothie with tofu I didn't think I would like it because of the tofu but it gets better ever time! Would  totally recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"This sandwich I must admit is a great idea but a couple of things needs to change. The waffle is delicious perfectly sweet n crunchy but soft at the same time. The grilled chicken I had was similar to the grilled chicken at Subway and the back is extremely thin. The Tiabi sauce I couldn't even taste. The sandwich should have better quality of ingredients and more sauce. Staff was very nice and patient, gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"Loved how they had vegan options. Very hipster scenery. We got banana Nutella waffles. Very taste. Really would like to try other options next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Great study place when it isn't during busy hours. The drinks are good, we have to try the waffle dishes next time!"}
{"text":"How have I forgot all about this place! I'll be spending almost every morning here. West coast is my go to !"}
{"text":"Super cool spot. Gluten free soy free waffle was very good. Ask for agave instead of syrup. Atmosphere is dope...great music (old school r & b) playing while u work, write or eat. And the music is at a thinking level lol. One to hit up for breakfast fo' sho' when you are in vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic place to get some great waffles with amazing coffee. The whole place feels really homey and is just awesome. My son's school recently had a fundraiser there, and everyone's mood was really jolly."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! I can not say enough good things about this little gem in the desert. Food was excellent. I had the West Coast a waffle sandwich with chicken bacon and avocado yummy!! And my daughter had the southern pecan waffle. The drinks were so good too my daughter had the twilight   lavender coffee tea, which I thought I would not like but actually loved!! And I had the coconut cooler with basil so incredibly good. Love this little place. Definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved unique coffee houses! They peek my interests when I travel and I enjoy when they have a good, cozy vibe. Above all, the coffee must taste great and not be ridiculously overpriced. 

This place is so delicious! They have friendly service and prices are reasonable. On top of all the yummy coffee options, they have tasty food. The second you walk in, it smells amazing. They are waffle bar and I often find myself having random cravings for their bacon waffle, but they have great sandwiches too! They have tea if you're not a coffee person. No matter your mood... you will find something here! Also, the names are fun and different. Definitely a change to your average coffee house."}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed with the quality of food and customer service this location had when I went there last Thursday afternoon. I cannot wait to go back!!

Around 3:30ish, I decided to drop into this location with a Groupon to get a bite to eat. When I arrived I was immediately greeted by this very sweet girl with black hair and glasses (I completely forgot to ask for her name), and she explained some of the items on the menu to me as I was deciding. I ended up getting the Red Velvet Blended Drink and the Strawberry Kisses Waffle. Both the drink and the waffle were delicious! The strawberries on the waffle were very fresh and ripe, while the waffle itself was perfect. It wasn't too hard or too soft, and it was flavorful. I loved the drink although I am not really sure how to explain it. Chocolately, but also Red Velvety?? Lol.

When I got there it was in the middle of the thunderstorm so I was the only one in the establishment (which was cool) since if it was super crowded it would be difficult to find a place to sit since it's a bit smaller than the Maryland Parkway location. The lady who was working was extremely attentive and kind to me, checking to make sure I liked my food and making small talk. It's really nice going to an establishment where the workers are friendly and helpful. I left Tiabi happier than when I got there.  

I plan on going back even without a Groupon! 
Great experience, great food and great customer service (:"}
{"text":"Really amazing service and food ! Get the guru buger or the waffledilla. By car best quality waffles you can ever find!"}
{"text":"This is place is excellent. Great service, friendly staff, and delicious food. We had the Thai basil waffle sandwich special and the hashtag breakfast sandwich. Both delicious. And I love that the side of fruit is fresh strawberries and bananas. And when they found out we like heavy cream with our coffee, they brought us a cup to our table. I would definitely come back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've gone here 3 times now because of a groupon my boyfriend got. The first two times I ordered the west coast wafflewich and this time I ordered strawberry kisses. Honestly my friend ruined waffles for me. She made a ton one time, 3 different flavors   The one that stands out in my memory was the cookie butter flavor. These waffles were so insanely delicious that now whenever I have waffles, I compare them to the ones my friend made and they are never as good. The other issue is I'm personally more of a fan of the Belgian variety of waffles over the eggo variety. Tiabi has more of the eggo variety, thin and crispy rather than thick and somewhat doughy. They have a nice presentation but I'll probably not visit them again."}
{"text":"Nice cool little vibe on the inside, cashier was friendly , I got the bananatella or something like that, shut was fire"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast and a smoothie and loved their unique twist on waffles. Smoothies are bomb. Great customer service. Def stop by."}
{"text":"First time here! Yelp made me want to try it. Their tiff's waffle coffee looked really good"}
{"text":"Captain Crunch frap is the business!  The honey cream latte is amazing as well..... House made chips and waffle sandwiches oh my!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, Strawberry Kisses waffle was delicious! I also had a strawberry smoothie, very tasty and not too sweet. My BF ordered chicken and waffles with home chips. He gave it 4 stars. The staff were very pleasant. I got to try a sample of churro, sooooo good. So I must come back!"}
{"text":"Great service! They were all very friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere and good prices. Hashtag breakfast sandwich and the hot Mocha latte were very good. Great fresh waffles and coffee!"}
{"text":"There's nothing that makes me more happy than a crisp, delicious waffle and a lovely latte.  

This is exactly what I found when I wandered into Tiabi Coffee and Waffle last week.  A coffee date with a couple of friends turned into a couple of hours of eating, sipping and go-fish.  

(This place has cards on every table and when you're sitting there you can't help but pick them up and start playing card games from childhood, which was a blast.)

I ordered the smore's waffle -- which probably wasn't fair because I've made some extremely delicious smore's waffles myself in the past..  But it was quite delicious! My friend ordered the bananutella waffle (which I actually preferred to mine) and my other friend ordered a waffle sandwich + the captain berry crunch smoothie (which was bomb, but only order it if it's all you're going to have because it was dense and filling and super sweet.) 

I have already been back to this place to order the Honey Cream Latte, which was amazing and will definitely have to make a point to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood! 

The staff is very friendly and the place is inviting."}
{"text":"This place is great! Friendly, attentive staff and nice, relaxed ambiance. But the real star here is the food! I am an admittedly picky diner as I am a pretty good cook myself...Bacon-stuffed Belgian waffle was cooked to perfection!! Wanted to eat the whole thing but was pleasantly stuffed after adding a fresh fruit cup for a dollar and a caramel frappe. :) Fruit cup was amazingly fresh, tasty and ample (for only a dollar extra, mind you), and caramel frappe did not disappoint! Total cost was under 15 bucks with tip. -Not bad for Vegas fare!! Eat breakfast here over the Strip!!!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting wake concoctions, such as the red velvet waffle or the maple bacon waffle. However, very dry, they were too crispy for my tastes, but they were cheap...so...ehhh"}
{"text":"What a cute and unique place! The waffle sandwiches were very affordable and filling."}
{"text":"A casual place for great waffles! Each waffle is made to order, so be prepared to wait for a little bit. The ladies behind the counter are friendly and have great recommendations if you want to try something different. This is a cool local spot to go with your friends and just hang out."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service was great and so was the food. My son ordered the waffle that looks like Pac-Man, and for the first time in a very long time, he ate it all! I got the red velvet waffles, and boy were they great. Their raspberry lemonade was to die for. My son actually got this but I drank some. Overall it was a great environment; they even had games and books to read which made it feel like a hangout spot."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go.  We really enjoyed their breakfasts. Clever combinations of seasonal flavors always made this place a treat :("}
{"text":"Excellent customer service,  excellent food, and excellent atmosphere. I would recommend this place to anyone. Loved it!!! Very good prices for what you get."}
{"text":"I have been pining for a visit after seeing the wonderful Instagram photos from Tiabi Waffle. Today we headed over around 7:30 and finally got to enjoy a waffle breakfast. I had the Elvis which includes banana, peanut butter, honey, agave nectar. It was the perfect waffle and portions are just big enough to be very satisfying, and not so massive as to be overwhelming.

My husband gobbled up his bacon infused waffle and exclaimed this place a solid 4!! Now this isa tough reviewer, who when he sees the word 'vegan' scrunches up his face and his head folds into his shoulders. This is huge!

I want to return for their blendies, smoothies with a great variety of ingredients, and the black lemonade which is infused with charcoal for digestion.

The cafe is cute and staff are super helpful.

You may find us here pretty often now!!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing. Staff are super friendly.... the brew coffee is good. My husband got the pecan waffle and he totally loved it!!! I got the bananatela!!! Omg!!!! It totally hit the spot....... it's a must try ....."}
{"text":"This place is perfect.  Just tried for first time and I know there is probably nothing on the menu that is a wrong choice."}
{"text":"Customer service: 5 stars 

Food: 4 stars because this place is no different that any other waffle place around town. 

Location: 1 star because the area is horribly run 
down And completely inconvenient to get to unless you work nearby or attend UNLV. Also the inside needs some serious TLC

All around I'd give it 4 stars because it was good, but it's not worth a drive to eat there."}
{"text":"Another fantastic visit! Had a vanilla cold brew & a waffle breakfast sandwich. The sandwich was DELISH and the coffee is so good that I literally look forward to the one day a week that I can drive across the Valley to have my fix."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a terrible experience there. I purchased a goupon and thought it would be a good reason to try a new restaurant.
First: The employee who took my order put her hand inside my coffee cup when she picked it up. I asked her to please give me a new cup, and that putting her hand inside the cup is unacceptable. As she replaced the cup she said, \"We wash our hands.\"
Second: When the same employee brought us our silverware, it was wet and dirty. I took them to the counter and asked for clean, dry silverware.
Third: The service was extremely slow. A party of four ordered before us, and they received 2 of their orders in approx 10 minutes, and the other 2 orders approx 10 minutes later. The employee explained that they can only make a couple of orders at a time, and offered some cookies as consolation.
Fourth: We got our order 30 minutes after we ordered it. I had the egg, sausage, cheese waffle sandwich. The egg and sausage were heated in the microwave and tasted like rubber.
The only good things: The gentleman that made our coffees did an excellent , and the strawberries on my husband's waffles were fresh.
I spoke to the manager, explained why we were there, our experience, and that we will not be back.
I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just grubbed on their Bananatella waffles! Delicious!  Definitely worth ordering.  A delicious crispy homemade waffle with Nutella sprinkled across it and then topped off with bananas, chopped almonds and whipped cream.  Tastes just as good as it sounds!  Ordered it online and had it delivered and although the delivery took almost an hour (it was through Uber Eats though) it was still hot and fresh when we received it.  Will be dining in next time we go for breakfast, but definitely worth the order."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Just had the west coast and it was the bomb.  Waffle was crispy and fluffy at the same time.  Time for dessert!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. It is a small place and not a lot of tables but that is the only negative--and isn't much of a negative. The first time, I had the Strawberry Kisses waffle and a honey cream latte. Both were excellent. The second time I had the West Coast waffle sandwich. Wow! Next time I'm going to be torn between trying something new and having the West Coast again. It was soooo good. The snickers iced coffee is wonderful! Another plus is that the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles. Amazing coffee. Amazing prices. What more can you ask for? 

Everything that we got was delicious. The snickers iced coffee was perfect, and the bananatella waffle tasted as good as it looked. Will definitely come back when we return to Las Vegas. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you are a vegan in Vegas, this is the place for you! We came for lunch one day, and came back for breakfast the next. I had the Savory Thai and Guru vegan burgers. They come in a waffle instead of a bun, though you can ask for a bun if you prefer.  All the veges were fresh, and the sauce on the burgers was amazing! The waffles (also vegan) are crispy on the outside with a fluffy center, and slightly sweet. Probably the best waffles I've ever had, vegan or not.  The blendies (smoothies) were also yummy - I tried the strawberry sunrise and banana peanut butter. If you like PB, definitely get the PB blendie!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Liked the vibe. It was perfect for a break from the office. Food was better than I expected and I was delighted at the light and tasty fare. Enough protein to get thru day. I'll return...for dessert! Don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Awesome veggie burger
Awesome waffle :)
Great guy on the counter.. Totally enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best craving around for sweet waffles and amazing tea and coffee... Very friendly... Helpful... Always good..."}
{"text":"Went this weekend and had some breakfast for dinner. Great meal and friendly service. Very creative menu!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this place, the wait was 30 minutes I was the  not so busy until after I ordered, table beside me all sandwiches,  look nothing special or exciting, got up to complain about the wait, plain looking waffle sandwich appeared less than 5 minutes, cut into it and took my first bite, super surprised on taste, West coast, juicy, seasoned  and simple but good, I rated to the FACT all items including  whipped cream on counters left warm , coffee took 15 minutes, dirty tables and a continuous  line that 3 people could not manage or give great customer service.  Why do you make fresh waffles and put them in an oven, doesn't make sense, unfortunately  I will not be back, too bad Very cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enjoying a nice breakfast with the family. 
Food was good. Options are great. And best part is they didn't up charge me for substitutions.
The pistachio latte is very light flavor.
Great portions too. 
The only complaint is dry waffles. Need sauce for sure."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Maryland, tiabi offers good breakfast food and smoothies at a good price. Good customer service and good music, I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hilton Grand Vacations and Ubered here with my daughter. Located in a strip mall, don't let the location fool you. This place Rocks!!! Unbelievable good Iced Coffee, I had the Coconut Truffle Iced Coffee. Ordered the Breakfast Sandwich and Strawberry Kisses waffle... we ate it so fast we forgot to take pictures of it!!! Get here NOW."}
{"text":"Small seating area. Menu is on the left side when you enter. Order at the counter and find a table. 

Utensils are very dirty. Bad dishwasher/ dish washing? I used napkins to wipe them down. 

Decor is boring. 

Food didn't take long to come out, maybe 10 minutes. 

We ordered a pistachio latte; delicious flavor, lightly sweetened with a beautiful nutty aftertaste. 

Bananatella: these waffles are different from what I have had else where. They are on the thinner, slightly doughier side. Nice crunchy exterior and softness as you bite into it. The almonds on top added a nice texture to the bite. Fresh, firm banana slices. 

Veggie breakfast sandwich: they use the same waffle for these sandwiches, which works great. The veggies were fresh, great tasting. No complaints. 

We enjoyed this place but for $16.XX I don't think we will be coming back. I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of my go to places when I'm in Vegas and need some good flavorful coffee with some food as well. Today we stopped in before we hit the road time travel back to Cali and I ordered TIFF'S Waffle  Macchiato and it was amazing the hint of vanilla in the macchiato made it even better...I also ordered the Butter Pecan Waffle with ice cream on the side a must try..I could have ate a whole one by myself but I decided to share with my sister...lol"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great location right next to campus. So on long school days, plan on stopping by especially during happy hour and grab a great coffee along with a little snack (the waffle that comes along with the drink!) Service is amazing and the baristas are always super friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee spots here in Las Vegas. Wonderful breakfast sandwiches, waffles, at that waffle Macchiato is unbelievably good"}
{"text":"If you want amazing coffee and waffles this is the spot.
My favorites are the pistachio, lavender and honey lattes. 
Bacon stuffed waffle with a cup of fruit and butter is my jam.

I called ahead it's faster service. Amazing staff. Try the home made baked goods peanut butter and jelly cookies!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!! The man at the front counter was extremely helpful, as this was our first visit. We came here Tuesday afternoon for lunch. I had one of the wafflewiches and it was so delicious and filling. Also, all of their food is very reasonably priced. I wish we had some of these restaurants on the East Coast. I know my friends would love it! Such a nice concept and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place . Everyones friendly, and the food/treats are amazing, try the the rebel punch you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best vegan waffles we have ever had!, That have an even greater drink selection than Starbucks as well! The viva Las Elvis has coconut bacon that taste amazingly like real bacon. Must give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here very early on a Sunday morning for coffee.  The cashier was friendly and very helpful especially since it was our first time there.  She even made recommendations and provided excellent customer service.  I ordered an iced hazelnut coffee sweetened, but no cream and also a maple & bacon infused waffle.  The coffee and waffle were a hearty and delicious breakfast, which surprised me as they were very flavorful!  The place has a nice coffee shop vibe, music was good but not too loud, and it was the perfect spot to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Yelnel was a super nice person. I probably murdered her name though. Sorry lady lolol"}
{"text":"A couple of months ago on a beat the street campaign (as I like to call it) a young lady came into my gym and handed me a flyer to this coffee and waffle bar.. Well, fast forward to today and I decided to come in for a coffee and bite to eat. I was instantly met with a lovely charm that was warm and refreshing to my soul. Adrian greeted me with a smile and kind patience as my indecision kicked in. I ordered a white mocha with almond milk (huge win) and the flavors that came from my cup tickled my senses and angered me because I deprived myself for so long from this treat. Anyway.. I look forward to being back soon and seeing where else this Vegas gem can take my senses..

Thank You Adrian!"}
{"text":"This place is a must when you visit Vegas. Its a little way off the beaten track but worth the short trip from the strip.  My husband and I got the west coast and hash tag breakfast sandwich and strawberry sunrise smoothie. The west coast was good BUT the hash tag breakfast sandwich was hands down..the best waffle sandwich I ever had. The waffle was so airy, fluffy, and buttery and the sausage and egg was puuuurrrfect. The smoothie was the best I ever had.  The guy at the register was so chill and patient while we couldn't make up our mind! We also had a red velvet lollie and it was was such a treat. I give this place 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place with an awesome staff! The menu is very creative and have options for everyone-- from carnivores to vegans. 
Although my order didn't come out how I had ordered it (hence the 4/5 stars), I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Came across this cafe on yelp on my weekly Monday breakfast adventure...and I was definitely happy with my visit. My husband I went shortly after they opened and we were the only guests dining in - there was a couple take-outs while we waited and dined (their website permits for online orders).

We were assisted by Mae (one of the owners) who was incredibly friendly and welcoming about our first visit.

My husband had the red velvet waffles, I had the #breakfast sandwich. I had a Carmel apple cider (by far much better than Starbucks) and my husband had a mocha latte (great also). 

While we did wait about 15-20 minutes for our food (not bad by any regular standards) - Mae was apologetic for our time waiting and treated us to a sample of their Churronimo (delicious!).

Will definitely revisit in the future!"}
{"text":"I literally just left this place and already ready to come back for more! I had the kale champ smoothie( which was actually amazing, with 2 full cups of kale) and the Elvis Belgium waffle: peanut butter, banana, savory crispy bacon, and honey drizzled on top of this light flaky waffle! I'm glad it wasn't burnt either because I HATE burnt waffles! Friendly staff and if you're a Unlv student you get 10% off your bill! I WILL be back to try more things off their menu!"}
{"text":"I really like this place very simple inexpensive. Food is good real friendly staff Excel they should increase their waffle maker I think it be a little bit more efficient. But other than that I think this is a great place to eat very tasty simple. Behind the strip"}
{"text":"Heard about this place the other day . Wow the prices here are awesome. I had the lolly waffle it's a turkey sausage wrapped in a waffle it was great. I also had the west coast wafflewhich a avacado blt so good. I als had a great smoothie. I highly recommend this place the service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Bravo! Excellent! The waffle is handmade and is so tasty. The special sauce of them is amazing. I'm a tourist from Taiwan. If i have enough time, i would like to come second,third,many many time even live near here!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years. First time we came was because we found out that Tiff the owner was from Guam. Of course us people from the same island support each other. It's at the outer edge of the strip so no need to worry about traffic so much. Located in a strip mall on Maryland parkway and across Seafood city. You have to try this place.  The waffles here are exactly how I like them. Thin and crispy in the outside but as you bite into to them has the moist texture. I love their honey latte topped with a slice of churro waffle!! The portion is so right and I don't have to feel guilty for those times your watching your calories."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I had had in Vegas. EVERYTHING was fabulous. Worth getting there early. Service was great and super friendly. 
Avocado smoothie, kale waffle salad and the chicken sandwich are delicious, not the traditional waffle combination."}
{"text":"Tiabi is a small-chill-cafe type of joint. It's nice for if you're in a hurry or want to hang out for a while.

My only cons are personal preferences mostly. For instance, I had a large iced pistachio latte with non fat milk, and the flavor was delicious but it was too damn sweet. Next time I will definitely be more specific about how I want my coffee.

I like the concept of the \"wafflewich\" but it's just not my cup tea. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order it again. Does not reflect on the business by any means.

To me, Tiabi is kind of expensive but I think it's similar to Starbucks prices.

I will definitely be back to try a hot coffee and one of their many waffles (:"}
{"text":"I had a green tea latte and they strawberries and chocolate waffle.  Both were yummie!!!"}
{"text":"So it's located in the plaza with Target on the Maryland Parkway side. It'd be easy to miss it if you don't know where to look! 

It's a small cozy cafe with seating for around 30-40 people? It's super close to UNLV which makes it a prime place to go to for a coffee break and possibly to study. They do have free WiFi! And the owners are pretty cool and really nice.

I ended up getting waffles and tea, more specifically I got the vegan version of Viva Las Elvis with vegan ice cream. It's a waffle with peanut butter, honey (agave if vegan version), and coconut bacon with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. The peanut butter melted into the waffle which was pretty awesome, because I mean melted peanut butter on anything is delicious! And the ice cream was well vegan vanilla ice cream and wasn't too special to me. 

I'll probably not get tea again, only because it was $2 for a bag and one cup of hot water. I'm not sure if they'll give you more hot water, but one bag and one cup of water doesn't seem like it's worth it. 

My biggest gripe was that it was DIRTY. I mean the tables, I went through two tables and they were both dirty. There was dried syrup on them and stains from the last customers. I looked down to see if there were any other tables, but most of them seemed like they were dirty to me. I tried cleaning some of it off, but most of it didn't come off with a napkin and some water. That to me is disgusting especially since it seems most people leave their dishes and the owners clean it off. That's just how it looked to me, when other customers ate and then left. When I got there the whole cafe was empty but as I sat there there were people that came and go. So they didn't really have an excuse to be dirty. 

I do however want to try some other menu items the next time I go. I just hope it's cleaner this time. I like the owners, they're pretty nice to talk to. I like the atmosphere. I like the location. I like some of their food so far. But I don't like dirty tables where I'm going to eat especially at cafe/restaurants/etc."}
{"text":"I had the honey cream latte, breakfast sammich with no cheese and my guy had the West Coast sammich with a caramel machiatto...everything was delish. Cute little coffee shop with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice service, quaint place. Coffee, teas and various waffles. Great for groups of two. Small inside."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! Husband and I went here today and this little coffee shop was incredible. We got the coconut truffle iced coffee and the tiffs waffle macchiato and both were delicious. For food it was the west coast and maple bacon waffle. The west coast was like nothing I've ever had. The flavors were so yummy and you would think with it being a waffle sandwich it would be hard to eat but no way everything stayed together perfectly. The maple bacon waffle tasted just like the Waffle House nice and fluffy and sweet. The service was fast and super friendly. We will definitely be returning here soon."}
{"text":"Delicious waffles. I always go for the guru burger, a vegan waffle sandwich. Friendly service, cool hang out spot. Did I mention their waffles are delicious?"}
{"text":"They have the best tasting waffles I've ever tried. It's just like a hole in the wall but they offer the best breakfast ever. Will definitely be back with more friends in tow."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place near UNLV. West Coast and Mocha is my go to. Great music and service too!"}
{"text":"Tasty and inexpensive, this little gem is a great spot for a coffee or yummy waffles.   Be sure to note the Vats of Nutella.  :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast or lunch spot. Got the waffle chicken sandwich with avocado. Also had their iced coffee. Price point was fair friendly service and good portions will be back."}
{"text":"Waffle bar. Those two words were what initially lured me into this place. I mean, who could resist the thought of personalized-topped waffles? Add the incentive of a groupon, and I'm on it...but unfortunately, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed both times I went.

I had gone to eat here when they had opened a few months ago. I didn't particularly have an optimal experience - my boyfriend's hashtag waffles were served a little cold, and though we were the only customers there, I remember we had to wait a good amount of time for our food to arrive. I understand that this place was just starting out and just getting into the groove of things, so I chalked it up to that factor and refrained from writing a negative review. Additionally, the location is kind of sketchy, but they have no control over that really. 

Flash forward. I decided to give it another shot a few months later. I ordered a dirty mocha chai and a West Coast waffle sandwich (bacon, chicken strips, avocado, tomato and cheese), which was the same exact order I had the first time around. The sandwich is what I'm giving the extra star for. It's worth a try, pretty good. It was better this time too as far as the amount of toppings go. Very filling. 

The bad news: Service time is still pretty lousy. I even added the pre-tip in hopes of speeding up our food, but it was in vain. The employees are friendly, but I was expecting a smoother and more efficient delivery. They should train the people in charge of preparing the food a lot better. It shouldn't take long to make a waffle and add the trimmings. Especially if the trimmings don't require much maintenance and cooking at all. I'm all about trying small businesses and was really rooting for their success, but it was just disappointing to see that this place hasn't fully quite worked out its kinks yet."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon in order to give this place a try on my most recent visit to Vegas. I did not get to use all three coupons, but I was able to try this place a few times. The wait can be a bit longer than expected, but the food is rather good. I had a smoothie my first time, which was delicious and filling. The second time, I had a Red Velvet frappe, which was amazing and a sandwich. The sandwich was my least favorite item. I don't know if it was the batter used for the waffle of the sandwich or the fact that it took 20 minutes to be served the sandwich, but I was not pleased. I would recommend this place, especially the Groupon if you plan on being in the area for a few days. I do suggest more staff to accommodate the orders. The same guy who took my order, also made my meal which only made the wait longer"}
{"text":"This place was alright, I liked that they had a vegan option however it was not that great. It had avocado, tomato, and spring lettuce (I think) with their \"special sauce\". I didn't like the sauce at all, and it just wasn't anything special at all. I think it was around 6 bucks, however I also got their pistachio iced coffee and LOVED that. My friend got a regular waffle which just tasted like a waffle lol & got the peach tea which she said tasted like water but I thought it tasted good. So overall good place if you think waffle sandwiches are cool and you just want to try one but don't expect anything outstanding."}
{"text":"I adore this cute little coffee shop on the North part of town. My favorite drink to order is the coconut truffle latte; I don't know what it is, but it's super sweet and yummy and it totally keeps me going when I have a lot to study for school. Waffle sandwiches are also great. I really like the Thai basil with extra sriracha :) 
Service can indeed be a little slow depending on the time you go, but expected from a little coffee place with only a few people working at a time. If you need a little pick me up and if you're tired of Starbucks, I recommend trying out Tiabi!"}
{"text":"It was really good I loved the waffles I got the service was great they were all friendly and patient. I definitely recommend it !"}
{"text":"I love that there's a breakfast place near UNLV that has vegan choices! Actually their yums, including waffles and smoothies are great all day long and their dishes are artfully displayed (like their vegan waffle with strawberries and bananas on top)! I love their vegan waffle burger, and my go to smoothies of theirs are the kale champ and the banana berry ones. Mae and Tiffany, the owners of To Be Inspired And Inspire are always happy and positive and their helper bees are great too! They also play a great mix of great tunes in their shop!"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in Vegas and checked Yelp for a place to go for breakfast. All the good reviews on here made us check it out- and we ended up going twice during our short stay. I had the west coast and a waffle macchiato. My fiancé had the golden waffles and a honey cream latte. All of it was amazing! Yes- it took a while to get our food, but they the food is so good that it's worth the wait. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and needed a good breakfast. This place hit the mark! I had the Elvis waffles (pb, banana and bacon) and a Snickers coffee. Both were delicious!
The only reason I'm giving it a 4 right now is that I still need to explore the whole menu!"}
{"text":"I'm all for helping out small, locally-owned shops, but to get me to visit a second time the food has to be good. With Tiabi, I'm on the fence. On one hand the B.A.T. wafflewich ($4.95) with its bacon, arugula, and tomato was delicious. I don't know what the Tiabi sauce in the wafflewich consisted of, but in combination with the other ingredients it made it unbelievably tasty. On the other hand, the Break-The-Fast wafflewich ($4.95) was a complete disaster. The whole thing looked sad. The sausage was barely warm, the cheese looked like it was straight out the fridge having had no contact with any heat to melt it, and the scrambled eggs looked like prepackaged/pre-cooked eggs found at McDonald's.

Somewhere in between in quality were the two waffle dishes I tried. Ordered as a Belgian waffle, the maple bacon waffle ($5.99) was thick and soft, as expected, with large chunks of bacon in the batter. The savory and saltiness of it in combination with the sweetness of the batter and syrup made it a solid choice all around. The red velvet waffle ($5.50), ordered as a classic thin waffle, lacked any crispness around the exterior. The flavor was well balanced with a moderate amount of chocolate chips and whipped cream giving it enough sweetness without making it too overindulgent.

With classic, Belgian, and vegan waffles, specialty coffee drinks and frozen drinks, there's plenty of promise here. Unfortunately, some of the execution on my visit was lackluster. And, don't expect fast service. Even with three employees hustling in the back we waited a while for our orders despite being the first ones through the door in the morning."}
{"text":"I noticed this place opening up next to Roberto's and was curious to try some of the drinks once it finally did. The first visit there weren't any tables out front and just 3 inside. The tables were dirty, so I cleaned one up with some napkins to sit at. The guy who took my order was friendly and helpful with questions I had about some of the drinks. My second visit I noticed they put a decent amount of tables and chairs outside making more room for customers which is nice. The one thing that was the same is the tables were dirty again. I had to clean a spot to sit and enjoy my coffee and breakfast, not cool. If the tables are left dirty then how clean is the meal prep area? Also the same guy took my order on the second visit and he seemed more eager to chit chat with another guy that was working than he did about answering my questions about the latte art or menu items.

Tiff's Waffle Macchiato ($4.75 for a large) - Cinnamon vanilla macchiato, whipped cream and a churro waffle. I loved this! The drink tasted excellent and the churro waffle was very good! Definitely try this one. 

Iced Honey Cream Latte ($4.65 for a large) - Honey, steamed cream latte with a dash of nutmeg. I asked for this one iced and it tasted good and was a nice change from the same flavors I usually pick. I noticed they promote that they do latte art and so I asked the guy working about it. He said that only he and the owner,Tiff know how to do the latte art right now until more people get trained and that you have to ask for it or your drink is marked to-go meaning it will be put in a to-go cup. It's not like it makes the drink taste different, but it is a nice touch and since this guy said he was one of the two who knew how to do it, well it would have been nice of him to have done it. 

White Chocolate Mocha Latte ($4.65 for a large) - I asked for this one hot and it was like the previous drinks very good. 

Golden Waffle ($4) - This is a waffle with butter and powdered sugar. There is an option to add seasonal fruit for $1 extra, so I did that. The waffle was hard and dry. I only made it through 3 bites and I was done. The seasonal fruit I added was sad looking and didn't appear very fresh, so I skipped on even trying any of it. Since the waffle I had with the coffee on my previous visit was so good, I was disappointed with this one.

I really liked the drinks a lot and they are 4-5 star worthy, but my experience with the dirty tables, waffle/fruit breakfast and the inconsistent customer service leave me on the fence with this one."}
{"text":"Best waffles I ever had! Nice and crispy on the outside with a beautiful golden brown color to it, and absolutely delicious fluffy insides~ Just as a waffle should be! Menu is very healthy, me and my boyfriend visited for a small breakfast and it was wonderful! I got a waffle macchiato, which is a splendid coffee toped with whipped cream and a waffle piece on top. The waffle was covered in a cinnamon sugar, so yummy! We also tried some kale chocolate chip cookies, don't be afraid of the color (or kale haha) they were soft and mosit and very delicious! You can't even taste the kale that much~ Great place for waffles or coffee (or both ;D) we will be visiting again to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The food was great but I waited for 35 mins just to get my west coast sandwich and plus its not even busy!?"}
{"text":"Fairly inexpensive    quick service  no smiles ever seen though   food is good  coffee is decent   typical local college food place    great deals thru Groupons and living social"}
{"text":"Taibi is AMAZING!! The staff and owners (Tiff & Mae) are super friendly and make some awesome food! This is gonna be one of the main things I'm going to be missing now that I've moved away from LV. 
For UNLV students: there is wifi and electric outlets for studying AND a discount if you say you're a student. 
For vegetarians and vegans: there are some great options and the variety keeps expanding. Also, they have almond milk options for all coffee drinks!
Hint: try the \"Maddie in a Basket\" (vegan wafflewich made with a kale waffle)"}
{"text":"Hastag breakfast is surprisingly McD like, just with waffles instead of buns! West Coast Wafflewich is delightful, just right for those who like small morning bites. Maple Bacon Waffle has Bacon made into the Waffle! That's another pleasant surprise. 

Strawberry Sunrise and Banana Berry is both very good healthy smoothie."}
{"text":"I found this place randomly about a year ago when I was craving some breakfast food on the way to UNLV. Just a quick search for \"waffles nearby\" and I came across this lovely gem, and boy, I am glad I did!
I've come here often enough for the staff to recognize me and have tried a number of things off their menu (and there's still plenty more to try!). I've recommended this place to people and have brought friends and family here, each trip ending up in a generally positive reaction the the food, atmosphere, and service.
The waffles and drinks offered here are numerous and delicious. From savory wafflewiches to sweet treats, theres something for just about anyone. The most popular item amongst the people I've brought here is probably the West Coast wafflewich or the Bananatella waffles. But if you can't find anything tempting on the menu or can't decide, you're welcome to create your own. And that can be anything--drinks, waffles, sandwiches, salads--if you can think it, they'll make it for you. Just to prove it, my boyfriend decided one day that adding chicken to their Bananatella would be a great idea (he's an interesting one). And while our server found it an odd request, they fulfilled it anyways. (Surprisingly, it didn't turn out that bad!) For the less daring, my personal favorite is a customization as well: the Strawberry Kisses waffle with bananas, paired with the Snickers iced coffee.
As for the place itself, the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. They have a nice rotation of music playing and a deck of cards on every table. The furnishings are quirky; tables with mismatched chairs, antique-style lights, and plenty of photographs and waffle-and-pop culture inspired paintings on the walls. It's a perfect place to eat and chat with friends or to catch up on some studying while sipping on some coffee. The servers are nice and friendly, always up to explain the menu and the new, seasonal items they're promoting at the counter (ex. Egg Nog Latte at Christmas-time or the Pumpkin Spice Waffle during the fall). The downside is that it gets pretty busy in the small space during peak lunch hours, and service can begin to get slow. The place isn't usually meant for a take-out and run, it's definitely better suited for people willing to sit, eat, and chill.
I definitely recommend this place to the Leslie Knopes of the world. In other words, it's the perfect place for a waffle-lover with time to chat."}
{"text":"Came here on my recent trip to Vegas because I didn't want the traditional pancake breakfast. This place is located in a strip mall so it was a little tricky to find. No menus just stand up and order from the board. The iced macchiato I ordered was absolutely delicious & came with a piece of churro waffle. My waffle breakfast sandwich was also very tasty and my grandparents loved their meals as well. My grandma had a red velvet waffle and my grandpa had a blueberry waffle. Cute little place and I would return next time I'm in town for your not so traditional breakfast experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Their waffle sandwiches are so so good, and their prices are definitely affordable. I had a Waffledilla wafflewich. The Tiabi sauce is so good. It honestly didn't look like much when I got it, but the delicious taste will pleasantly surprise you. My parents got the West Coast wafflewich and the Savory Thai Basil wafflewich. Both of them loved it! I also got an iced Twilight Lavender Latte, which tastes like a lavender white mocha. It's on the sweeter side, so I personally LOVED it. However, if Starbucks type coffee drinks are not your thing, perhaps that's not the drink for you. ABOVE ALL, even if this place is a little out of the way from where you live, I still think it is definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! It has a great atmosphere, the staff is really friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick snack and bumped into Tiabis which is right by my place. I've never had a waffle sandwich before and boy it is delicious!"}
{"text":"This Waffle joint is a bit off the Strip in Vegas but well worth the time! Service was good and food was fresh. Coffee is locally roasted and very good! Toni B and I enjoyed the place and food. I recommend taking the time to find this olace."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice now after buying a Groupon worth $8 each for three visits. My first visit was early in the morning on my way to work and I decided to try one of their lattes and salads out. I ordered the green tea latte to drink there and the kale salad to eat for lunch later on. The green tea latte was very good. The size was reasonable and the price is what's expected even without the Groupon discount. The kale salad was also very good, decently proportioned and reasonably priced. The lady that was working there was very kind and helpful. It's good to say that my first experience there was rather pleasant and I was excited to drop by again to try the waffles.

I came in the second time with my boyfriend so that we could both try the waffles. I was looking forward to purchase the red velvet waffle since red velvet is one of my all time favorite flavors lol. After ordering, I sat down and waited for our waffles to be done. I noticed an uncleaned table the table over us. This table was not cleaned the entire time we were there. Now, I used to work at a food establishment and I can be very understanding in certain situations. One, the place wasn't busy. There were probably 4 people eating including us with a few customers coming in to order. Two, there were three people in the back because I counted 2 guys and 1 lady. One of the three could have easily cleared out the table the entire time I was there. It's just professional to keep your establishment clean. The workers seemed rather distracted and too busy talking to each other rather than checking the dining area for mess.

We finally got our waffles after 15 minutes or so. I feel like that's rather a long wait for just two small orders of waffles. I ordered the red velvet one (of course) whereas my boyfriend ordered the regular golden waffles. We both agreed they were good after finishing them. They only gave us two waffles per order and you'd have to pay an extra $2 for another one. But for the price, you get what you paid for so it was fine. However, on the website's menu, it says that you get more with the waffles like bacon and eggs. This is very misleading because I did not. It doesn't say on the menu at the store so I wasn't so surprised when I got my food. I just think that the website menu should be updated so that future customers are not mislead.

Overall, the waffles were good, the coffee was good and the salad was good. The customer service may need a little work however."}
{"text":"Couldn't stop talking about these waffles on our road trip. Luckily our trip began and will end in Las Vegas, so we are going to get some more waffles before we fly out! My brother loved the maple bacon waffle and I like the waffle sandwiches with turkey sausage.
Note to owners: One waffle is not enough....The waffles are so good, they should be sold in pairs.
Coffee is good also. It's nice to be able to get good coffee and breakfast in the same place! Staff is very friendly as well. It's located near Target if you need RT supplies, so a great place to have breakfast to begin your road trip!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, unique & all around great. Also reasonably priced. Cute little spot with amazing coffee & waffles for coffee & breakfast lovers like me! They even have vegan & vegetarian options. Love the friendly, super welcoming & helpful staff. You must try this place. I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Came here since we heard good things about their other location.

We tried their West Coast Waffle and the Elvis one...the filling in the west coast one was good, as was the Elvis, but the one  thing I didn't care for was both of the waffles...spongy texture with barely any crispness. I like waffles with a  crispy exterior and a sft interior and this was like eating a pancake in waffle form.

The Snickers coffee drink we ordered didn't taste that great either. Very artificial tasting...The Churro waffle was okay too. Service was another issue...wrong things were sent to our table,  and when our food arrived,  there was no silverware down which took a while to get as well.

So-so first visit with a possible chance of returning.  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"This place was sooo good and plenty of vegan waffle options to choose from. Great great coffee. I got the churro waffle, with cookie butter vegan ice cream, and strawberries and bananas (which were super fresh). It was delicious and so flavorful. My sisters all throughly enjoyed there's too! Highly recommend it for vegans craving anything waffle."}
{"text":"Yummy!  From their speciality coffee creations to the waffle sandwiches...everything was so good!  The two ladies working also seemed to enjoy their job and life in general, which is nice to see. The only deduction made was due to the wait time.   Only one worker to prepare food?  Seems inefficient, particularly during a morning rush."}
{"text":"Great waffle place. Nice area. Cashier is great ! Will come again !  I tried the waffle is really good. And you get 10%iff if you check in ."}
{"text":"This place is really cute- the atmosphere is hip and eclectic, and they even have decks of cards to play with at the tables. The establishment is clean, and they have a few  yummy looking things for vegans on their menu. The staff is passionate and friendly, and I loved the small business vibe that it had.

I didn't personally have a great overall experience there, but I realize from other's reviews that my experience was definitely not the norm.

When my fiancé and I ordered our food, I didn't think it would take much more than 20 minutes to get it on the table, but the guy working there did warn me that it might take a couple extra minutes. No big deal. After waiting about 45 minutes, I needed to leave for work but we had already paid for our food- which I found out hadn't even been started yet. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, so I went to find out what was going on. It turns out, the one person working there was filling a 30 sandwich catering order before making our 2 sandwiches. The owner/manager person came out to see what was wrong, and ended up basically yelling at her employee for not offering us a free upgrade to Belgian waffles so that he could use the other iron and get our sandwiches out quickly.

Now, yes, that would have been a smart thing to do, but what about the possibility of putting the only two waffles ordered in the last hour in front of the 30 catered waffles? Or the possibility of not charging for the meal we had to take to go and I still ended up late for work? Or at the very least not chewing out your employee for a unfortunately handled circumstance that could not have possibly been covered during training? 

Also the manager/owner lady was worried that I would give her a bad review on yelp, and kept bringing it up and asking that the employee's mistake wouldn't cost her a good review. I don't go on yelp just to give people bad reviews, but it's not often that I have an experience this bad either.

The sandwiches and coffee themselves were absolutely fabulous, and since the service was definitely situational, I would not be opposed to going back sometime to give it another shot. Even more than being late for work and not getting any sort of complimentary item as an apology, I just really don't appreciate the lack of professionalism that the management showed the day I went in. I've been in situations where my boss embarrassed me in front of customers before, and it's really the worst thing.

But like I said, it was just a poorly handled situation, and the food was so dang good that I would not be opposed to giving them a second chance- I'm just not chomping at the bit to walk through those doors again."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place was so delicious. Go. Just Go."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try! 

The waffles here are the bomb but what really surprised me that I loved was the coffee. As a barista, I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to it but every time I have gotten the coconut truffle iced coffee here it has 1) woken me up and 2) made me want to come back for more. This is a small feat considering how high my tolerance is for caffeine. I love it. 

The atmosphere is great for having a conversation, grabbing some lunch, or lounging about and I love the Guam seal incorporated in the back drawing! Also, Tiffany the owner is often working along with the other baristas and is great to have a conversation with, always remembers me, and the other baristas are friendly as well.

My fiancé loves their black coffee and waffles too. I am pretty sad that I'm not near UNLV all the time any more during the day so stopping by for now will have to be a treat but whenever I'm in the area I will make it a point to swing by!"}
{"text":"Waffle looked and tasted great!!  Lots of options if you like waffles, Just wish the bacon was thicker. The staff was very friendly and made sure you understood your options or would make something for you."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and tiabi was recommended by my cousin who lives here. A few minutes away from the strip but well worth the drive. Terrific prices for excellent waffles that are healthy too!"}
{"text":"Delicious and friendly staff/owners! I went here with some friends after a hike with at Mt. Charleston and this was definitely what we craved! The 'Waffle macchiato', which was actually a cinnamon vanilla latte that came with a delicious cinnamon sugar covered waffle was PERFECT. We all enjoyed (this is a very modest statement because everything was fantastic) our food. We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here for brunch probably around 10:30am, and it was amazing! We both had the Dirty Mocha Chai, she had the Kisses and for me, Churronimo. Dirty Mocha Chai had good flavor, right amount of strength and not too sweet. The waffles were delicious! The staff is super friendly and the place had a great atmosphere. When we went it was easy to find seating. It was a really nice place to chill and hang out. I would definitely want to stop by again."}
{"text":"I really wish I could take this coffee shop back with me to Los Angeles! Very accommodating to a plant based diet. I got the lavender coffee and it was amazing!!! The ambiance and the workers were both very nice. I am impressed with this place :) this waffle is amazing. Best waffle I have had since I've been vegan."}

{"text":"Passed by Tiabi so many times. I Finally got in for brunch with my siblings. Nice and close environment with friendly staff . I absolutely loved the menu especially the vegan option. Ordered a waffle with bacon, egg and cheese, don't recall what I ordered but good portion size and flavor. I recommend coming here for breakfast with some friends or just to hang out on your day off."}
{"text":"OMG!   The best waffle ever.  Had a Belgium waffle. It was light crispy and DELICIOUS!  I love waffles.   But it is hard to find a good one.  This is the place!  Every thing is made here including the whipped cream. Got a chai latte coffee.  It was perfect."}
{"text":"Random place my friends and I chose while yelping brunch, after getting gas. I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with brunch because he always misses breakfast. Right when we came in, they greeted us. Since it was our first time here we took a while to choose what we wanted.  I ended up ordering a West Coast. It was okay! I wish they put more chicken. The cheese melted with the waffle which made it taste good! I also ordered a honey cream latte. I'm no coffee person so I can't tell what coffees are good but my friends and boyfriend said it was \"really\" good. The last thing I ordered was a Red Velvet. I personally liked it because it wasn't as sweet. It kinda bothered me because it was so perfect... (Hahahaha). I had a weird urge to stab the holes... When I'm near Vegas again, I am definitely coming back! 

Stars for the customer service! There was one lady who was kind of rude but then two other employees took her place right away when they saw our faces from smiles to me and my friend looking each other giving \"She's so rude\" look. (Yes, it's a thing haha.) Usually they would charge for Avocado and Chips but they just gave it to us for free with a smile. Thank you again! :D"}
{"text":"Rate: 3.5

So glad I came here!! There is a variety of different type / style of waffles. ..from breakfast to lunch/ snack.

Southern waffle: diced ham, melted cheese, w/ avocado. 

Prices: very affordable. 
Environment: clean and friendly"}
{"text":"One of our fav breakfast places- you order and sit so it's a great place to go with kids because you won't have to wait a long time. Healthy options as well as sweet ones and we've always had nice customer service."}
{"text":"Wow. SO glad I stopped by this gem on my way out from Vegas! Small place with big flavor! I tried the West Coast with an added egg....delicious their coffee is pretty on point too, great morning after food options and the staff is simply awesome"}
{"text":"#breakfast sandwich was super delicious. Waffle with scramble egg and maple bacon. Jon had the strawberry Kisses breakfast. Both were served hot and scrumptious!  We shared a Strawberry Sunrise smoothie.  Oh my gosh, it was just the right sweetness from the fruit.  All the people  working here a are great, so friendly!  I really appreciate that.  The cherry on top of this put stop is the prices. They are so reasonable.  What you need after a three day stay in Vegas!  Lol. Let's just say I am super satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is soooo yummy but ad for a diet.....yikes! Waffles & Coffee was so good. Only down fall is they need more staff and use plastic disposable utensils and plastic disposable cups for water. I will definitely be back. I have to bring my son here. Oh and there is. Groupon.....bonus"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and need a quick breakfast joint. Tiabi is the place to go! The customer service is wonderful and super friendly. Not only that but they're vegan waffles so I can't complain! Especially since my boyfriend is super picky on what vegan food he will eat with me since he's not vegan but he loves it here! They have great smoothies and a awesome choice of waffles. But definitely let them know you're vegan maybe tell them twice because I told them I was vegan and they made my waffle completely not vegan so I had to order something else and by the time I got it my boyfriend was already finished and ready to leave. :/ The Viva La Vegas is super filling and yummy. The waffles also feel very light and not heavy in your stomach! Defiantly check it out if your in town!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with sweet treats. Enjoyed my coffee, I forgot what it was called, something like a Joe Special I think. Remembered it was sweet and satisfying. My friends had their own coffee and waffles and were happy. This place will make you smile :-)"}
{"text":"I used to hate waffles once upon a time. I've never been a breakfast gal, so waffles never tickled my fancy. 
But in 2014,I found myself pregnant and working in Alaska. I happened upon a waffle house and ate there with my co-workers. They had the best pancakes I have ever had, with a ham and egg waffle that was divine. 
Since then I've been on the hunt for a waffle that could compare. I thought maybe those waffles tasted good because I was pregnant, like how many foods taste better when under the influence of certain substances. 
But I persisted. I have eaten at a few waffle places here in town and the waffles here are the best ones I have had yet. The maple bacon waffle reminded me so much of the waffle up in Alaska that it is all I can think about wanting for breakfast. The only thing that stops me is that I live in green valley and I already drive for a living so I avoid it at all costs. 

COME HERE AND EAT THE WAFFLES. Take it from a formerly-pregnant-lady-turned-mom-who-used-to-hate-waffles-but-now-only-likes-the-really-really-really-good-ones."}
{"text":"Great waffle bar, very affordable. Go for the great choices & yummy buttery waffles. Family friendly, nice environment. The sweet & savory choices were very good. Mocha latte & wild berry lemonade were delicious. The only negative was the bacon. My family loves breakfast and the bacon tasted like microwaved bacon. The staff was awesome & they even brought my baby girl warm soy milk...lifesaver.(that's like her morning coffee-she can't function without it) Overall we really enjoyed this place & we will be back, everyone gave the waffles a 10!"}
{"text":"This is a cute coffee shop that makes amazing drinks and food. The atmosphere is very nice. The food is made so fresh and it is a great breakfast and coffee shop! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some buttermilk chicken wings and waffles, this is not the place but If you are craving a wholesome vegan made to order waffle with grilled chicken, this place is for you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have great waffles, shakes, sandwiches, salads, espressos and cookies!! There are tons of vegan friendly dishes too. It's a great spot, really happy we found it!"}
{"text":"Best darn waffle I've ever had! If you're visiting Vegas, this place is definitely a must! Good food, great service! I subtracted 1 star only because they are so busy, they can't clean off the tables fast enough and seating is limited. Still, I would return in a heartbeat, it's so good!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Great place if you have any dietary needs! Their gluten free waffle was amazing, Adams their vegan ice cream was quite delicious as well. Pretty good coffee, although a little burned. The inside was mostly clean, but kind of run down."}
{"text":"Can I have a waffle, a waffle, and a side of waffle? :D

This coffee/waffle inspired shop is a hidden sweet tooth haven. It's tucked away in a plaza off by UNLV. When you walk in the aroma of hazelnut, baked goods, and coffee tingles your nostrils and it's goood. I ordered Tiff's Special which if memory serves me right is a caramel vanilla machiatto topped with a waffle and I had to get a loaded waffle dish (Toppings include: bananas, Nutella, almonds, and whip cream). You get two waffles which is perfect if you're hungry or to share if you're just looking to snack. The coffee was fresh/strong/sweet/milky which made for a great combo. If you're looking for sweet, comfort food on a chilly day this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Best waffles in town hands down!!! And they are veggie & guilt free too. I will be going back a lot for the iced coffee too!"}
{"text":"Came in for waffles at 6:00pm on a Monday. Place was dead. I thought this place had a lot of promise. But, it seems the kids behind the counter were distracted with their social lives and dating. My waffles came out cold as shit with no butter. When I got butter, the waffle wouldn't even melt. Really poor time management, we watched as our waffles sat on the counter waiting to be dressed while they did other things. Waffles weren't terrible, but who likes cold ass waffles? I asked if that's how they normally do and the apathetic kid said no, and would I like them to heat it up. Who like nuked waffles?  I'll stick to places run by adults. Too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent mom/pop Cafe in the Central area in Las Vegas near UNLV. The few times I've been here in the past months have been amazing. The Baristas are very engaging and accommodating to your needs. The owners are very passionate with Coffee and inventive with their food items that they offer. 

**A little FYI, I'm good friends with these former green apron workers for years. If your interested about their background ask about their story and how they come to have a coffee shop. Personal favorite is Stiles Java Jolt and West Coast Wafflewich, must try items along with Tiff's Waffle Macchiato and Coconut Truffle Iced Coffee drinks. Ambience is pretty much straightforward with emphasis on artwork and pictures of random travels of the owners with a hipster vibe. 

Cool place to hangout with friends and expect a lot of millenials and tourist here since it's near LV Blvd."}
{"text":"An extension of there original Maryland Pkwy. Location. The staff is friendly and manage by Tiffany S. one of the owners. She will always make you feel welcome and aims to pleased everyone she meets. Everything here is great and finally tried their Thai Basil Wafflewich today which was simply amazing, must try.

It's great to see an independent coffee shop in an area that is underrated. Kudos to Paul and Tiffany Stiles!!! for being part of a community that deserved something unique and truly TIABI - (To Inspire And Be Inspired)."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. I will definitely be back. Lots of Vegan options and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I never knew how much I needed churro waffles in my life until today! My friend and I split a Strawberry Kisses, which was absolutely delicious. The waffle was crispy and definitely reminiscent of churros, but not overly sweet. It was nicely topped with a chocolate drizzle, whipped cream, and strawberries, and tasted just as good as it looks. I got the Snickers iced coffee, which was fairly yummy - more on the sweet side rather than having a strong coffee flavor. My friend got the lavender latte, which was presented with a cute latte art heart. I'm eager to come back and try more items from here!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Fast and friendly staff. The Elvis waffle was to DIE FOR!!! They have a huge selection of coffee drinks, waffles and waffle sandwiches. Leave room for dessert!!! Even the bathroom is adorable."}
{"text":"The waffles are very crispy and good! I got the lavender drink and also the peach drink but neither was very good. Both felt like there was something missing. The vibe of the place wasn't there; and it wouldn't be somewhere I'd sit and enjoy eating at. Especially since they are going for a cafe type place. The customer service was subpar as well. It took the person 5 minuets to actually acknowledge us even though we were the only people there."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for some waffles and coffee, but VERY WELL worth the money (and wait, since my boyfriend and I had enough time to play solitare and a couple of games of speed before our food came). The lady noticed that I was vegan when I asked for almond milk with my mocha frappe and she gave me a heads up and let me know they use milk for the base so I ended up just drinking water instead (which is free, they have a cute little water station). I ended up ordering the guru burger and my boyfriend got the vegan wafflewich and we also decided to get the churronimo. It's a quick little breakfast bite but it was so good! I know I'll end up coming here from time to time now that I know about this place."}
{"text":"Nice place, close from my house!!
Update review
- Slow day no  to much people sitting, slow service; 4 people in the kitchen they talk to much don't work, using the cellphone. Bad service today!! 
I ordered breakfast Sandwich 'cause they're out of avocado, It came first my waffle and then my coffee . I returned the waffle the egg was overcook tasting like plastic with a lot of black pepper.
The waffle machiatto was really good.
Then I received My waffle, honestly didn't like it to much, the turkey sausage very dry I believe the used the same that came at the first time. 
Maybe bad day, but the service is the same slow when is not even busy .. 3stars"}
{"text":"The unique menu options and affordable prices make this place a great breakfast joint in the Las Vegas area. Though the preparation of the food isn't speedy by any means (~15-20 minutes), it's well worth the wait. It's uncommon that you find a place with exceptional coffee options AND tasty breakfast food. 
The breakfast sandwich I chose was well crafted with the perfect balance of each of the contents inside. The coffee was also noteworthy. 
Another aspect of this gem of a restaurant is the prices. For being situated in Las Vegas, the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and looked on yelp. We found this place and decided to come. It is kind of a hole in the wall and a little hard to find. When we came in  though it was really cute. The person at the front was really nice. We got a kisses waffle that was really good. Not like a waffle i have tasted before also got a vanilla latte with whipped cream that was super good. The bacon waffle also looked good. Next time."}
{"text":"I keep on coming back every time cz I started to crave waffles now that I know what they are. I actually had waffles for the first time in my life at Tiabi and I don't regret it at all. 
Girls that work here are so welcoming.  Feel like I'm invited to their house, and they're such amazing hosts. CLEAN and healthy. Very tasty .. The owner gave me this vegan cookie to try as a sample and I tell you.  It tastes amazing.  I'm not vegan nor vegetarian but I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"Great little place near McCarran Airport. If you need to catch a morning flight out of Vegas, do yourself a favor and spare yourself the airport food and have a great waffle and coffee here before your flight!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot!  Fun, fresh, funky great waffles!  Fantastic service from the fun and extremely nice employees!  You should order two things though if you like to eat a little more than average.."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be a little different. I thought it was going to be more like a diner and not a cafe. I had a bacon and maple waffle and it was delicious. My two year old ate most of it. I also got the pistachio latte. Amazing!!!! The things I didn't like, there was only two people working so it took a long time to get our food. Each meal came out one at a time. My youngest fell asleep before his breakfast came. The other thing I didn't like was that they didn't have high chairs. That means that I can't bring my kids back. So I would say great food but not really as family friendly as I was expecting for a waffle place."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE. First, the waffles - slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Combine that with a wide assortment of their toppings and you're golden. Go for extra decadence with their drinks - boyfriend ordered their tiff macchiato (comes with 1/4 churro waffle!) and I ordered their tuxedo frappe, both of which were fantastic, if a little on the richer side. We are visiting Vegas only for a few days and so far we just haven't been able to have something other than Tiabi for breakfast. Kudos to the guy behind the counter, who was really friendly and made sure we enjoyed our stay!"}
{"text":"I searched for the best breakfast in the local area I was staying a got here. Our first impression upon arrival was a very small coffee shop and nobody behind the counter working. No worries because we had never been here before and wanted to check out the menu. After 5 minutes and no signs of employment in this place we asked the only people in the place if this was usual to have to wait and asked if we needed to ring the bell to get service. So we did and a girl who looked like she wasn't to happy to see us came around the corner and asked what we wanted 10 ft away with no greeting. We proceeded with our order and our awkward exchange with this unhappy employee who appeared to be working solo. I was horrified when my food arrived the hashtag breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage. See attached pic and let it speak the words that I don't want to describe. Lets just put it this way, just stop and get a Mcgriddle from Micky D's and save yourself time, $$ and not to mention your taste buds."}
{"text":"Delicious local spot. Lots of sweet and savory options. I had the west coast and it was the perfect combination. My kids had strawberry waffles and my husband had the breakfast sandwich. They were happy to customize it and everyone was happy. I wish I lived closer. I'll def. be back next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Totally random in a weird little shopping plaza. Quaint inside, but everything we ordered was delicious. Hard to find a good vegan waffle and this place has it! Also, the woman behind the counter that served us was super nice."}
{"text":"I wanted waffles for breakfast and this was close to school so I decided to go check it out. I ordered the the Banana Nutella Waffle from the classics and it was delicious! They have many options: sweet, savory, waffle sandwiches and dessert waffles. It was filling and a good breakfast. The prices were about $7-9 depending on what you get. You can sit in or do to-go. I did to-go because I had work. I'll definitely be back and would like to try the Red Velvet Waffle and waffle sandwiches next time. You also get a discount if you show your UNLV Rebel Card."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan options and jay was knowledgeable and friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place.  Great food selection and prices.  My waffle was delicious, but it was so hard to decide which one to order.  There were so many delicious and unique options that you will not find anywhere else.  There is an equal variety of coffee drink options for those wanting to get coffee somewhere other than a national chain.  You will not be disappointed.  The only caveat I have is that the tables are small and there are few of them.  Seating is limited, although there was outdoor seating for when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"I love tiabi it's one of my favorite restaurants, the honey I'm home waffle is seriously so good it doesn't even need syrup. All the waffles are incredibly moist and delicious. I wish the prices weren't so high though! Without the groupon I would never go"}
{"text":"Been her a week! Ate a lot at multiple places! Best food I've had! This place is delicious!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A quiet lovely place away from the noisy casinos for good waffles and coffee. Love my red velvet waffles with bananas and strawberries, drizzled with chocolate syrup. The wafflewiches were also delicious, although was not big enough portion for big eaters like us for lunch, more like a snack size. Didn't have a chance to try their smoothies. Will have to visit again."}
{"text":"I love it! Almost all options are available in a vegan version. Yum!
I am moving, and am so sad I will not longer be able to come here. So I made one last trip today. I hope they consider expanding so I can enjoy the yummy items here once again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the service here and the food. They have really perfected the art of the waffle!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both with Groupon or LivingSocial vouchers. The food is very reasonably priced without them, so I'd probably go back anyways. Around $6 for a delicious waffle sandwich. I'm not a huge waffle fan, but these are light and fluffy and make a great base for a delicious egg and sausage sandwich. Staff is super friendly. Last time I was in there I ended up chatting with them for quite some time before heading out of town. A+"}
{"text":"The customer service was great. 
The shop was very cute.
The coffee was delicious.
However, I was not impressed with the food. I had a breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage and it leave me with a huge tummy ache."}
{"text":"Heading out of Vegas and was looking for light fare that was reasonably priced (unlike everything on the Strip).  Came across this gem on Yelp and had to try it out.  Had the veggie breakfast sandwich.  Yum! Girls had dessert for breakfast, which is fine because we are on vacation!  Would definitely visit again when in town."}
{"text":"Came in here cause of the reviews , I was expecting for this place to be soooo good and to be worth the drive , but I didn't like there food at all , the sausages  looked like there are just put in the microwave and they just tasted horrible .!!!!! I also had asked for one of there ice coffees and was expecting them to give it to me in the jar like the  pictures I've seen in Yelp , but they gave it to me in a to go cup !!!!! I seriously won't be coming back here again. There food is just nasty !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little Cafe, The Waffles and Coffee were great, as was the service. Also dug that they had a Vegan Waffle Option!"}
{"text":"Good creative waffle combinations. The churro w mocha almond chocolate ice cream was spot on. Awesome drink choices too. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place was super awesome! I got a South American Wafflewich which was amazing-it had a little spicy flavor but still super good! I also had a Honey Cream Latte iced and it was very sweet & super yummy!! I defiantly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Closest thing to Bruxie here in Vegas. Captain Berry Crunch a must!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had Viva Las Elivs and a wafflewich - and they're both fantastic. I grew up in Europe and we don't have anything remotely similar to the waffles at Tiabi. 

I'm definitely coming to Vegas to have these again. 
Actually - I'm in the car right now driving to Taibi to get another wafflewich"}
{"text":"Really cool set up inside. I like the vibes it gives off. I got the banutella waffle and I would say it was okay. I would recommend the Elvis one."}
{"text":"Even though I'm only giving Tiabi 3 stars, I'll be back. Why? 
-The prices are fair
-the atmosphere is clean, welcoming, and work friendly
-the employees are extra helpful
-the food is just okay

While the waffle alone is tasty, there's nothing extremely unique about it. And when put in sandwich form, the only unique thing is that it's sandwich stuff....inside a waffle. If you're expecting to be full, you may need to order another menu item as well. 

Here's what I've had:
-Golden waffle- tasty basic comfort food
-Vegan Tiabi Waffle- no difference in taste/texture so also tasty
-West Coast Wafflewich- bland and not filling 
-Tokyo wafflewich (i think that's what it was called. pretty much chicken, lettuce, and special dressing)- bland and not filling
-Avocado Dream Smoothie - not my jam
-I had a really delicious Coconut/Lime drink not listed on their menu online

Like I did state before though, the atmosphere is top notch. Everyone is warm, friendly, and very helpful when it comes to making food decisions. The other day I was there to pick up the golden waffle and I was kindly offered syrup, utensils, a back, all with a smile :-D The service definitely makes up for the okay food, and I'll probably just stick to ordering things on the sweeter side as opposed to the savory (bland) sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite for breakfast or lunch. Their waffles are EXCELLENT, and who knew you could make a slammin savory sandwich or burger with waffles? SO FREAKING GOOD!! The smoothies are also delicious. I'm vegan and gluten free. The waffles are already vegan, just ask for the gluten free mix. They are super friendly and accommodating. Try the coconut bacon and the banana peanut butter smoothie. And the Tiabi sauce is great. Yay, waffles...!!"}
{"text":"Food on point, service not so much. 20 minutes just to order and another 25 minutes to make it. Not sure why they have 2 people working on a Sunday morning but they definitely need more employees to man the long lines. Waffle breakfast sandwich was good, a little over cooked on the egg but the waffle was perfect. The coffee drink was tasty as was the chips and the fruit. I indulged in the banana chocolate almond waffle and that was the icing on the cake -great way to end a brunch."}
{"text":"Our Churro Waffle with Seasonal Fruits was Delicious.  I'm not exaggerating  my husband and I enjoyed it til the last piece .  My Honey Latte was very flavorful.  My husband and I will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"I hate leaving negative reviews, but hopefully this well encourage management to make some improvements.

First of all they're basically a self-service breakfast restaurant. I wish I would have known that before coming, because the last thing I want to do when I go out to breakfast in the morning is carry a bunch of stuff to my table. For instance, my order required 3 plates, how was I supposed to carry that, they didn't provide a tray. 
The floors were dirty, my table was dirty and the tables all around me were also dirty. It's hard to enjoy a meal when there's so much uncleanliness around. Please clean your floors more often and take the time to clean tables once customers leave. Small details like this say quality.
My waffle was also crunchy and cold...
Sorry, again I don't like leaving negative reviews. The restaurant was super cute I think the self serve concept might be good enough for some people but when you're half sleep and just want some food it's not ideal. They did complete my order very quickly."}
{"text":"I really want this place to succeed (who wouldn't want two young entrepreneurs to be successful?)  but some improvements are needed. We were lured here by a Groupon offer. I hope this critique is viewed by the owners and taken into consideration with this in mind. I love the concept of a waffles and coffee shop. Our coffees and waffles were very tasty and we did enjoy the food (maple bacon and red velvet). However, a place that specializes in waffles really needs more than one regular waffle iron and I would also like to see the option of a Belgian waffle added. Heck there are even waffle irons that make waffles shaped like the state of Texas...that would be a fun addition. Invest in more waffle irons! When ordering coffee to drink in the restaurant it is much, much better served in a glass coffee cup/mug. The paper plates and very cheap plastic utensils did not provide the best presentation. At the very least try to budget for a better quality of eating utensils. Again- the coffee (an iced snickers coffee, a latte and a cupcake coffee) were all very good, so maybe glass mugs can be added to make them perfect. The atmosphere is okay but I would encourage the addition of some cozier seating and décor...I would have ordered another coffee and stayed longer. I liked the chalkboard wall. The place was a bit cluttered with trash, overflowing trash cans and our table was sticky with dried syrup from what seemed to be days old. There were no pastries in the pastry case which made me sad. The music was too loud at first but was adjusted and included a nice variety of genres. This place has big potential. I realize it takes a lot of money to open a business and hopefully the owners can make some adjustments and improvements to make Tiabi a place to return to. Good luck girls!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of seven and all of our dishes were great. Their smoothies are large and super refreshing. Great vegan options, highly recommend the Elvis (yum!) The workers took their time to perfect all the waffles which made the wait time worth while."}
{"text":"My TIABI experience was top notch! It's locally owned by these two young girls from Guam who works there too. Mae is one of the owner & greeted us with a genuine smile. She gave us recommendations for a health nut like me and I was not disappointed! I always opt for the gluten free options and I tried their Hashtag Waffle with turkey sausage & eggs- it was delicious!!! My friend had the West Coast Waffle that had bacon, chicken, avocado with their TIABI sauce & she was speechless! The waffles had the right amount of crunchiness & sweetness at the same time- & the portions are huge! We had the Kale Champ (kale, bananas, orange, almond milk) & Tif's Waffle Macchiato that came with a cute tiny churro waffle with the drink (like an umbrella in cocktail drinks but you can eat the waffle & dip it in your coffee- yum!). Kale Champ was a champ! No bitterness & just a tad sweetness. The macchiato- Wow! Smooth, aromatic with a hint of cinnamon. The price is very reasonable- where can you have gourmet coffee or shakes with an out of this world waffle entree for just a little over $10 bucks?!  The place is simple with a local vibe touch to the interior- chalk board with cute drawings, a locker that has graffiti signatures from customers, and couches to relax or study. It's right next to Target near UNLV.

We came here after our Spartan race yesterday because we were craving for some good waffles. We heard about this place from the locals & drove there from the race site as fast as we could without getting a speeding ticket :-) We were still wearing our medals. It was such a perfect place to celebrate another successful Spartan race!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent local coffee and delicious waffle sandwich. Not greasy or heavy, left me full and not feeling like a fat ass. I look forward to coming back again, especially after a recent  terrible breakfast fail at Bruxies (gross!)."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed... I search good coffee on Yelp and show this shop. I got signatures drink ... coffee was okay. Maybe I should get waffles... next time I'll get waffle not coffee
And takes 15 min to get wifi"}
{"text":"This is the best place for waffles and they are so good. They make waffles with whip cream and strawberries with chocolate. The waffle is so good that you don't even need syrup. Then to the drinks I tried the snickers coffee drink and it actually taste like snickers in drink form."}
{"text":"I have been to Tiabi a couple of times now and I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the service you get here. Of course the waffles are awesome and the drinks are to die for (Twilight Lavender Latte is amaaaaazing) but the folks working behind the counter are the real stars here. Whether it is systematically breaking down the menu so you get exactly what you want to eat or trying to accommodate food to your dietary restrictions, they are TOP NOTCH! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to treat themselves."}
{"text":"This place just happens to be right next door to my favorite sushi spot in Vegas (see review for Sakana) so i'm really surprised its taken me this long to try out.

The girl working the counter was super bubbly and nice which is exactly how I want to be greeted first thing in the morning. There is nothing worse then someone working at a coffee shop in the morning who hates mornings.

We ordered:

Tiff's Waffle Macchiato- 4/5

Great flavor and I loved the cute little churro flavored waffle piece that topped off our drinks! My only disappointment came when they were presented to us in plastic drink-ware instead of the cute little mason jars we saw pictures of here on Yelp.

Bananutella Waffle- 4/5

Came out perfect with just enough crunch on the outside and soft fluffy waffle goodness on the inside. Covered in Nutella drizzle, bananas, and sliced Almonds. It was very, very rich. I ate 1/3rd of it I had to take the rest to go. I feel like this would of been better for dessert, too heavy for breakfast for me at least."}
{"text":"I will and forever have a soft spot for TIABI. When they first opened, I LOVED the welcoming vibe the owners gave me and my friends. They stopped by our table and shared with us that they were UNLV alums (go rebels!) and friends who decided to open up this cute spot together!

Since their opening, I've tried plenty of their menu items. With my go to being the West Coast. It's savory and refreshing (thanks to the avocado). Other notable favorites include Kisses and the Red Velvet Waffle for those with a sweet tooth.

The only thing about this place is that you never know what to expect with service. There are times when it would be swift, friendly, and efficient. You are going to be welcomed with a bright smile from the cashier and get your order in a reasonable time. But there are times when you are greeted with a blank, cold stare as if you've obviously interrupted them with their cleaning and get your order after a longer than usual wait.

Do yourself a favor and if you are return guest, do a call-in order. You wouldn't wait as long and you have more time to eat and less stressing."}
{"text":"I think this has to be the most California place I've ever found in Vegas and I loved it regardless. Waffles, coffee, smoothies- what more could you want from your neighborhood cafe? Service is pretty fast and super friendly. 

Wish I took a chance to try more items off the menu, but I'll just have to wait until next time I'm in Vegas. Glad I ran into this gem of a place."}
{"text":"I want TIABI.  I want To Inspire and Be Inspired, but first coffee.  

TIABI has become one of my favorite spots to satisfy my caffeine cravings.  My drink of choice is their Espresso Frankenstein (4 shots of espresso & agave blended with ice).  I will usually Frankenstein my Frankenstein by adding some of my own MCT, protein powder, and some heavy whip cream (only if my fat intake is too low).  This drink is enough to give TIABI the stars that I say they deserve.  First of all, the beans they use is local and comes from Colorado River Coffee Roasters.  If you're not familiar with CRCR, then look them up. CRCR can be found in other coffee shops around Vegas like Grouchy John's.  TIABI's Americano alone is good. Having it in their Frankenstein Espresso is the best.  There really is no reason for me to try any of the other drinks since I'm sold on their espresso.  

TIABI also serves waffles in a bunch of fun ways.  They got waffles with fruit, bacon waffles, red velvet waffles, Vegan waffles, a churro waffle, waffle sandwiches, and a waffle named Viva Las Elvis (banana & PEANUT BUTTER). I've tried their Waffledilla (chicken & cheese wafflewich) and the Break-The-Fast (bacon, egg, & cheese wafflewich).  The proteins inside really hit the spot. I'm more of a pancake guy, but still liked both wafflewiches.  Besides, waffles are just pancakes with Abs anyway. 

As for service, I think it's the best.  I have never had a bad visit and it's always nice when you're greeted by name.  TIABI is very small and there's usually only one person working.  If you're getting a little more than just a drink, then you should also expect a little bit of a wait.  Waffles can't cook themselves, right?  Overall, I'm more than just a fan.  I love the coffee here and after just one sip, I'm ready to inspire. 

TIP #1:  Hours 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM.  Closed on Monday.  I would be here a lot more if they were open earlier. 

TIP #2:  Get the Espresso Frankenstein

2017 Yelp Review #69"}
{"text":"I used to visit the Aliante location on a weekly basis and I'm still bummed that the location has since closed.  My go-to drink is their Espresso Frankenstein (4 shots of espresso & agave blended with ice).  This location doesn't have it on their menu, but they're willing to create it on request.  I love this drink and will add my own scoop of protein powder to it. TIABI specializes in latte's and great coffee.  I'll make the trip out here at least once a month for their Americano.  They also serve waffle sandwiches with a creative touch. As for service, it's the best. The owner, Tiffany, and the staff at TIABI know me by now.  They know that I'm here for either the Espresso Frankenstein or a large Americano.  TIABI, I will see you soon."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop close to UNLV. Awesome food and nice place to come and study or just hang out. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend for anyone who loves coffee and/or waffles."}
{"text":"Very solid little cafe off the strip to get a waffle and coffee fix that won't leave you broke. The creations are also pretty darn creative so you don't really lose with any choice, sweet or savory.

I went with the Viva las Elvis cause peanut butter, bacon, and honey are a match made in heaven. My only complaint (and I feel like I'm disappointing so many people saying this) was that there was too much peanut butter. It completely overwhelmed the bacon. I also had visions about adding some chocolate to this dish so I stole a chocolate chip off my brother's waffle and yes, it was 100% worth it. Also, paired it with a honey cream latte - yum!

Brother went with the red velvet waffle. He said it was pretty simple, but it was still very good. Mom and dad shared their choices a wafflezilla and west coast waffle with a fruit cup. Both enjoyed the savory/sandwich twist for their breakfast and they were also impressed with the fruit cup which featured fresh chopped fruits. Mom had the pistachio latte, which is definitely more on the sweet, not really coffee side. The only caveat was that food prep was a tad slow. Each person's meal came out one by one. Hard to have a holistic breakfast this way....but it's a small operation. 

All in all, it was a delicious experience."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, good coffee waffles were a bit crunchy for my liking however that's just me. The Churro waffle has the perfect blend of cinnamon sugar, add some banana on top and a scoop of ice cream makes it perfect. Would recommend to any waffle and coffee enthusiast. Picture: (Churro waffle with Birthday Cake ice cream and Banana, Coffee: Snickers iced coffee)"}
{"text":"A very cute coffee shop with amazing food and of course coffee. I tried their Viva Las Elvis which is vegan when taking out the honey and it was delicious! I keep coming back just for that waffle. The atmosphere is calm and it's clean!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty average, not really seeing the hype.  Got a breakfast waffle sandwich with basic food vendor bacon and eggs that looked like maybe they were frozen in a previous life.  The waffle itself was way too sweet in my opinion for being made into a sandwich.  The place is too small to be comfortable to sit and eat, and outdoor seating was taken at the time.  The owner I'm assuming said goodbye as I was leaving as he was conducting business at the table next to me, but that was as friendly as the service got."}
{"text":"The waffle was really good !
I would recommend this to a friend. 

Shout out to Jay for the good customer service!"}
{"text":"This place really took a beating on Yelp from some of my friends. Did they have a bad day or what? Maybe they've just improved overall? I love this place so far.

TIABI has been over on Maryland near Flamingo for a quite a while now. Maybe it's just out of sight, out of mind for me (since I haven't been to neighboring restaurants like Sakana that often), but it's certainly not too far from one of my workplaces. I was able to stop by for lunch to try their menu at long last.

They seem to be having some issues with music skipping (streaming lag perhaps), but it's a pretty quiet place either way with plenty of seating for studying or just enjoying food and drink. Baristas have all been friendly so far, and it was easy to use the Groupons that I'd recently purchased.

The iced Snickers coffee ($3.35 for 20 oz large size) is appealing, even mildly addictive. Although it doesn't perfectly capture the peanut-y essence of the candy bar, its chocolate and hazelnut combo are a reasonably sweet flavor fusion that provide both fuel and happiness. Plus, it's quite reasonably priced compared to other places.

The West Coast waffle sandwich ($6.59) is an obvious choice for a savory lunch. I was pleased first and foremost by the lightly crispy and spongy, fluffy waffle that's creased so that you can just pick it up. The chicken and bacon satisfied my carnivorous sensibilities. The delicious, fresh veggies (avocado, tomato) brightened the dish up. Finally, although the sauce wasn't that distinctive alone, it served as a perfect complement. Nothing was limp about any of this.

I went for the Pumpkin Truffle Latte ($4.65 for a large) on my second visit, opting for hot rather than iced. What a treat. It's a perfectly sweet, creamy drink with a moderate spice accent, and I wish it wasn't just a seasonal item. Maybe if I just ask nicely and bat my eyes, it won't be just seasonal? It's the drink that has finally sold me on that whole annual fad.

I also had the seasonal Zombie Waffle ($6.50). This red velvet waffle has bacon cooked on the inside. I had to ask because they're not immediately visible, but using a knife (obtainable at a station near the counter) to cut and even cross-section the waffle, I saw the thin fatty strips. This dough otherwise had the same texture as my wafflewich, which means it rocked. Flavor-wise, it's actually mostly savory, with the chocolate syrup drizzle serving more to accentuate the red velvet batter than to tilt the balance toward sweetness. This also needs to be a year-round treat.

TIABI has impressed me so much on my two visits that I wish I hadn't been so apathetic before. It's a great spot for caffeine and fuel to carry you through the day, and I'll be back even after I use the last of my Groupon 3-pack."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vegan Wafflewich and a Pistachio Latte both were very delicious! Staff was super friendly and helpful if you've never been there before. I didn't realize until after I ordered that you can substitute the waffle for ciabatta on the sandwich. I would definitely recommend doing it if you aren't a fan of waffles."}
{"text":"I love this place, everything is so cute & it seriously feels so hip, the food hits the spot & the teas are super perfect"}
{"text":"What a delightful find! We're semi-stranded waiting for a tire change and Tiabi came to the hunger rescue! Loved out waffle-sandwich and kale champ smoothie!"}
{"text":"Found this place thru a friend. At first I wasn't too sure about stuffed waffles butttttt oh my goodness! Heaven! I had the Bananatella waffles. Nothing but amazing. Peach tea is def on point. My husband had the ALL American waffle and added egg to it, delicious!"}
{"text":"It's really chill here, and the food is tasty. Everyone is very attentive and kind. There are great vegan options, and the food is fresh. Large variety of coffees. Try Wednesday bogo 1/2 classic waffles."}
{"text":"Tasty, but realistically 5-7$ for a single thin waffle is a little steep. Can't comment on any of their drinks, but their waffles were very light and crispy. 

To the guy who gave them a 3 star rating for their decor alone, I don't know what you're smoking but you really ought to stop."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in this place... You are transported to Seattle coffee house that has mated with a gastropub (if there is such a thing). Anyway it goes, I loved it. The food was so good and the culture is one all it's own. The service was top notch; friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. I'm really impressed and look forward to the new menu."}
{"text":"It's a great place. I was sad when they closed the one down in North Las Vegas. I have noticed that the portions have gotten smaller. Especially, their waffles. I mean how much are you really saving by cutting down the batter? I gave them a three because I called for pick-up one morning (in a rush/tired/hungry due to finals and lack of sleep) and I was on hold for five minutes. It gave me enough time to enter the freeway and exit. I hung up and tried calling back and no answer. It was 7 in the morning.. I can't imagine they were swamped with people. I didn't even receive a callback."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the ladies working, I believe owners a well, were so nice. I have had better coffee but I am from Seattle, and I hanger had much worst coffee here on Vegas. The vegan waffles were so good and moist as well. It is out of my way a bit, but could be a special treat every once in awhile"}
{"text":"Every single thing we had was A*MA*ZING! We had the Tiff's waffle macchiato and it come with a churro waffle, kind of reminded me a pumpkin spice latte, must've been because of the cinnamon spice the kids had the bananatella with vanilla ice cream and my partner and I shared the viva las Elvis, I will definitely be coming and we highly recommend this place! Just look at the last pic to see how much we enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This little gem was amazing!!! We found it on yelp. It was off the strip which was a nice change. It's by a target shopping center. The place is small and intimate. The menu is on the wall and very easy to read. I got a coffee and it came with a churro waffle! See the picture. It was sooo delicious! My banana waffle had bananas, nuts, and nutella drizzled on it. It was so amazingly good. I would have gone again if we were staying longer. Definitely will go again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I Bookmarked this Place earlier, I had some time so I decided to give it a shot! 

It is a Cozy little Cafe located on Simmons & Centennial on the North side of Las Vegas. Right between Roberto's Taco Shop & a Little Casino ( don't know what the name was, sorry) Anywho, The Customer Service was Excellent, Tiffany who is also the Owner of this Establishment Greeted me, I told her it was my First time there, She explained how the drinks are made. You are able to see your drinks & Waffles being made, if you sit close to the Order Counter (there is a little window where the Kitchen is). BTW: Their Baked Goods are Vegan!

The little cafe itself is very clean, there are only a few seating areas inside, and on the tables are Playing Cards should a round of Poker, Go Fish, or Crazy 8's tickles your fancy...lol! They have added more outside seating if you prefer.

Parking stalls are a little crampy, so just be careful opening your car doors, lol!

I have found my little getaway, Sorry Human Bean & S'Bucks....This Lady is Supporting this Cafe instead!"}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time and decided to try the pistachio latte, it was so incredible, sweet but not too sweet, smooth and creamy that when I finished it I decided to try the waffle macchiato as well. That was also great. The place was clean, bright and not overly loud. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and the prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be back and would absolutely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a super cute hole in the wall coffee shop. I had to try the churro waffle. Jay was friendly and helped guide us through the menu. They have traditional coffees as well as signature drinks. My boyfriend tried the snickers. I tried the Twilight lavender latte. I also got it with almond milk. As someone who can't have dairy,  I love when I have other options beside soy milk.  They also have an extensive waffle menu and a vegan friendly menu, including vegan treats. I tried a kale chocolate chip cookie and was impressed with how tasty it was. I also tried the churro waffle. I would recommend getting it with ice cream I got it without ice cream, and it was a little dry but other than that it was really good. If you want to be adventurous, and try a churro waffle, you can add a quarter waffle to any drink for a dollar. It is a smaller Cafe, so it's much more friendly to smaller groups and more intimate settings. They also have Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. No, seriously, it is.  Where else can one find green smoothies and scrumptious waffles in ONE place?

So eat the darn waffle, and then repent by drinking blended kale. Yup, pretty much,

As we walked in, we were greeted by happy faces and the scent of warm, delicious waffles. I was very impressed by the selection of vegan goodies they offered. But luckily, im not vegan, so it was time to indulge with deliciousness. We ordered the Banana Tella waffle and sat down. They make the waffles fresh for each order so we had to wait a couple of minutes. When the waffles came out I had one regret: we had ordered one to share. And although one is actually pretty big, this is the kind of dish that should never be shared with a lived one. Its seriously good enough to break friendships and end marriages. Luckily for my husband, I had a big lunch before it, so it  wasnt so bad (the sharing, that is).

If you like waffles, GO. If you like smoothies, GO. If you like coffee, GO.

Just go. Seriously. And order the banana tella. You are welcome."}
{"text":"Great waffle! Good prices. I had a vegan waffle with strawberries, whip cream and drizzle in chocolate. Amazingly tasty. I had a similar waffle on the LV Strio for a lot more. There are other vegan choices as well such as the guru burger. Well worth the drive to find this place. Will definitely return when back in town. Wish I had one near my home."}
{"text":"Super delicious and super friendly, plus their mantra is one that is close to my heart. I got the Viva Las Elvis waffle with Nutella added and it was an explosion of sweet and salty goodness in my mouth. The Snickers iced coffee was also good, but not as impressive as the waffle. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend is an expert barista at Starbucks who knows everything about coffee, so when she asked me to meet her here for a cup, I knew it must be good! I'd never had vegan food before, so I figured I'd be adventurous and order one of the vegan waffle sandwich thingies - it even had a veggie patty on it. To my surprise, it was delicious! Everything was fairly pricey, but it was a fun new experience that made it worth it. Definitely the kind of place I'd go to right after getting paid. Oh, the coffee was great, too!"}
{"text":"Like mentioned before, it's a hidden gem in Vegas. Their coconut basil tea was amazing, very refreshing! I've tried their west coast waffle which was great, not heavy nor greasy. Defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes because I believe that waffles are the ultimate breakfast food, but I was sadly disappointed in every aspect of my experience at Tiabi.

The gentleman taking my order had visibly unwashed hair with very bad dandruff. 

My waffle sandwich was extremely dry with a poor quality of sausage patty and overcooked eggs. 

My iced coffee came after my meal was served and was watered down.

I still have high hopes. I'd like to see Tiabi turn it around. They have a great concept, but they're not executing it very well."}
{"text":"I got the groupon for this place and decided to try it out with my family and another family after church. I can say that this place was overpriced for the amount of food that you get. We got the south american, the waffledilla, and the bannanatela and I was not amused. the food did not have any flavor and the chicken tasted like it came out of a can. It tasted like a watery sponge. It was very chewy. it also lacked flavor. the Waffles that came with every meal were over cooked and very dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Once I finish of this groupon I will never go back waste of 40$ P.s. their self proclaimed Frankenstein espresso wasn't not even strong or filled to the top. I got a large and it was filled halfway. Did I say it was expensive??!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!! They have the best peanut butter smoothie and my kids love the waffles! Gabby is super sweet and always knows exactly what to recommend of the menu! Great service all around!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Vegas and had picked up a friend in the area. I searched for breakfast places and this place popped up. I'm not a big fan of waffles but the signature coffee drinks looked good. Both coffee's that my husband and I got were amazing and the waffles are Incredible!!! Need to come back with the whole family."}
{"text":"Making this my ritual stop when visiting Vegas!  You are welcomed with the hip hop music and the cozy eclectic vibe. The staff is very helpful and patient with your abundance of menu options. Love how they offer Daisy Mozzarella option. The Pistachio Latte with almond milk hot, iced, and frappe is full of yummy .  The West Coast Wafflewich is good eats!  Crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Tiabi sauce was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Ok let me start off by saying i absolutely love this place super offbeat in the best possible way, the quirky decor and i love the huge chalk wall the message is totes me. Right away when you step into the doors you feel relaxed and welcomed. Between the chill atmosphere friendly staff you never want to leave, bonus they have playing cards on the table to entice you to stay a while. Perfect for an after work chill spot or rejuvenate after a long day of shopping!  The prices for the portions are redonculous! Averaging about $6 buck. I got the Banatella Belgium waffle and i know you can see my face but its covered in drool! the waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy warm goodness on the inside i had mine topped with a scoop of Thriftys (yes i said Thriftys) ice cream and my waffle stood up to the scoop the bananas, delicious Nutella drizzle and almond slivers without ever getting mushy! My friend got her own creation (she's a bit of a mad scientist) She had the traditional waffle with chocolate chips, strawberries and caramel and she had no complaints. I will definitely be back hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Found this nice little place. The service was friendly.  The waffles were tasty.  I had the red velvet waffle.  I really enjoyed my peaches and cream latte.  Not too pricey of a place either."}
{"text":"Absolute best. Must come in and have the waffle macchiato. Just perfect. A Vegas staple for us. I also have the viva Las Vegas waffle. Great!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. Purchased a Groupon which got me in the door but I will definitely come back. I ordered an Almond Joy iced coffee which tasted more like chocolate to me that any notes of almond or coconut but I still found it to be delicious. Had the break the fast and the South American. Came cut so that way my bf and I could each get a half of the sandwich to try it out. I like the crispiness of having a waffle as a substitute for bread and both of the sandwiches were satisfying. 

Recommend this place as the service was amazing. Everyone was very nice and welcoming from the moment you walk in. Also, they have a deck of cards at each table to play some games while you wait for your food. The bathrooms were clean and appealed to my inner nerd by having a Star Wars sign outside of the bathroom to indicate the gender."}
{"text":"This little waffle bar is adorable. It has a cozy ambiance. It is clean and the staff is friendly (hugely important). 

The waffles and sandwiches are warm and light and infused with amazing flavors and unique combinations. They are healthy comfort food stepped up a notch!

Add coffee, tea, smoothies and a laptop or a friend and you've got your morning or afternoon neighborhood place to go if you just want to kick back and you're not in a hurry. 

Bravo! Well done Taibi! You get it!"}
{"text":"First off, Tiabi has both a Groupon and Living Social deal. The Groupon is $14.25 for 3 $8 deals. The Living Social is $4 for $8 or $6 for $12. 

The shop is in the same plaza as the Target on Maryland Pkwy. It is to the right of Target if you're looking at it straight on. The shop itself is cute with some couches and drawings on the walls. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I have to say. 

The girl at the counter did not know how to use the Living Social deal we had. After calling 2 other workers over and charging us the wrong price she had to refund the entire order and start over. Also she never scanned the app so if I were not the good person that  I am, I could re-use the deal and get $12 of free food haha. You should probably teach your workers what to do with it!

After our food was made they placed the food on the counter and called our names, however we didn't hear them and the food ended up sitting on the counter for a couple of minutes. There were four workers in the store all standing around behind the counter talking. Take the time to bring the order out guys! It was obvious we didn't hear you and it wasn't like you were busy- it was the only new order you had.  I thought it was a little rude that you would call our name out again instead of just walking it over. 

We ordered the bananatella waffle and pac man waffle. The bananatella was good, but nothing I was impressed with/would want to go back for. The presentation of the pac man waffle was horrible. I hope there's a picture of it on here, because I forgot to take one. Who wants a waffle that's a quarter missing? 

The dirty mocha chai sounded amazing on the menu board, but it was all disappointment in my mouth. It was just a strange combination and did not work for me."}
{"text":"My first visit. I had the waffle macchiato with a churro waffle. It was delicious. Great combination of sweet and coffee. The menu has a lot more fun items to try. The place was inviting and had comfortable chairs. There are not too many tables so I am not sure how it is when it is super busy. Check it out."}
{"text":"Staff were really friendly and welcoming. They have really yummy drinks, teas and coffees. Their waffle sandwiches are really tasty. They serve their drinks in cute little mason jars. A great little hangout for friends and also a cool place to study."}
{"text":"Their churro waffle is amazing. Warm and crispy and the coffee is really good too! Tiff's waffle macchiato is my favorite. The place is nice and cozy, staff is super friendly. They are good for breakfast or brunch with their different waffle selections."}
{"text":"So very disappointed.  Maybe we came on a bad day.  It took 10 mins before either of the guys behind the counter bothered to look up and say hello.  We ordered waffles and regular coffee.  25 mins to get the waffles and when I asked about the coffees, the guy behind the counter got really snarky.  He said the were slammed and the coffee would be up soon . Seriously??  It was regular non fancy coffee !?  It finally came 10 mins after we got the waffles.  Coffee was like warm and the waffles weren't very good .   Oh  and there were maybe 14 people in this place, and 7 of them was our family !"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and even came around with free dessert samples...which now I may need to get because the churro waffle was incredibly good.  The prices are cheap (2 people 2 lattes a waffle-wich and a waffle was just about $20).  The lattes are great and unique (never saw a pistachio latte before) and the food is great.  If you want a cheap great place with a very relaxed coffee house type atmosphere check it out!!!"}
{"text":"found this gem via living social.  
Break fast waffle (waffle, egg, cheese, bacon).  Simple and yummy.  I can see some people preferring some kind of sauce on this but this was right up my alley... perfect.
Ice cream taco waffle (waffle with ice cream, chocolate chips, and nutela drizzle.  Amazing!  I wish I didnt have to share this with the wife.
This was probably my favorite place I visited on this Vegas trip that included some much more pricey places."}
{"text":"I just love this place and the prices you can't beat. The employees are always super nice and welcoming. This was my first time getting an iced caramel macchiato from here. Its delish, espresso is strong and the caramel is buttery. Once you mix it all up, its perfect! Oh and the icing on top was the churro baby waffle (paid extra) but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Cheaper than Starbucks. I had the frankenstein espresso and hubby had the signature iced macchiato that comes with a waffle. Both delicious and huge drinks for under $10.  Minutes from the strip. Will def be back."}
{"text":"New coffee gem on the north side. I had the Tiff's Waffle Macchiato and it was so delicious with the little wedge of waffle and whip cream. Can't wait to go back and try the pistachio latte. Will definitely be a frequent flyer."}
{"text":"came here for brunch with my mom and loved it! We tried their Coconut Truffle Iced Coffee and had the West Coast with Chips and #Breakfast Sandwich and delisciously fresh baked Pecan Hazelnut cookie...YUMMY! Mom really liked her Pistachio latte and said it was creamy and complimented the espresso. The weather was perfect today so we also decided to sit outside. We love this location because it reminds us of the first location on Maryland Parkway and we're so glad that we can come here when we're in the Aliante area!"}
{"text":"Delicious waffles, great coffee and amazing customer service! Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"The place was playing classic rock which was an immediate plus. We were the first customers that day and the woman who was working at the time was very nice. I ordered a bananaetta (a waffle with bananas and nutella) and was not disappointed. The banana's were delicious. I also enjoyed the vanilla chai latte. This is one of the few places where I felt like I paid the right amount for what I received."}
{"text":"Great waffles, coffee and vibe. 5 mins from UNLV can't wait to go back and try a waffle sandwich. The waffle macchiato was amazing! Wish the cashier was a little more friendly considering it was our first time. Didn't really give any suggestions.  Deff worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My review solely relates to the waffle sandwiches. I LOVE waffles and love idea of sweet and savory food but my craving for a yummy sandwich and chicken was only faintly satisfied. The problem was the flavor, or lack there of. I got the West Coast, which comes with chicken, avocado, bacon, tomato, cheese and Tiabi sauce. Somehow the sandwich was really dry and missed the flavor the mentioned ingredients should have given. The waffle had no crispiness or flavor at all. Super bland. This is my second time having Tiabi, the first was probably about a year ago and as i remember it was underwhelming as well.
I will try ONE more time and see if sweet waffles are better."}
{"text":"Best customer service in town! Delicious waffles i broke up with Starbucks to get my lattes here at Tiabi best coffee ever come try !"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. Officially one of my favorite spots to visit whenever I get back in town.  Waffle pack so much flavor however remain light and puffy. No one wants to feel sludgy and overfull at brunch time! According to society i have a tight restrained lifestyle of being a vegan. Tiabi provides many many options for me which don't include me yawning as i chew down, if you know what i mean. :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing and awesome and this is my new regular spot. I'm glad Ian told me to stop by and the Vegas option was great. I took a bite of her sandwich and was already prepared to be disgusted but it was actually amazing. I got a west coast and had to come back for the breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"This will definitely be a go-to whenever I'm in town! I ordered an iced coffee with the West Coast waffle sandwich & it was amazing! Chicken was tender, avocado ripe, bacon was perfect, & waffle was soft with a nice crisp. The staff was very friendly & Israel was helpful in suggesting items on the menu to satisfy my cravings. Atmosphere there is was casual & cozy with good music playing."}
{"text":"Not bad. I come here because it is so close to UNLV. Good drinks- try the waffle macchiato! 
Food is A-OK. I like that they have vegetarian and vegan options, but the waffles and sandwiches aren't anything too amazing or memorable to me. It's worth a try if you're really into waffles, but for me the food menu items are just whatever. So far I've had the cinnamon waffle, elvis, and vegetarian wafflewich. I'll keep trying more items and update if anything deserves recognition.
The location is a bit shabby so I make sure to bring my stuff with me. I wouldn't think of this place as comfortable- so it's not a place that you would want to study at. Eat, chat a bit with friends, and go. 
As for customer service, don't expect too much. They get the order done. 

Groupon has some deals for this business ($24 for $12 or so), so be sure to check that out."}
{"text":"Never had a waffle sandwich before. Exceeded expectations. Waffles were light and soft. Plenty of delicious looking options to keep us coming back"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the drinks are even better. A little pricey but totally worth it. I recommend the Butter Pecan Waffle with infused Bacon and ice cream. Also hot espresso with a scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a simple Mother's Day lunch at this fun spot in the Target shopping center. We each got a different waffle and shared. My daughter always goes for the breakfast sandwiches and got the Hashtag sandwich. She loved it. I got the Waffledilla and the hubby got the West Coast Wafflewich. All were very good. Unfortunately, their Belgian waffle machine was down, so we couldn't try that type of waffle. Also, the drinks look yummy, but we just opted for water. Service was very friendly and there were games and cards around the tables leading to a killer game of War (I did not win).

Looking forward to returning soon to try one of the sweeter concoctions."}
{"text":"Just disappointed with 2 out of 3 of my experiences here. Food is good, when it's served hot, but very inconsistent. I'm not sure if this place is owned by a teenager, I know they have to work too but proper training is definitely necessary here. My first experience my food was cold and they forgot the strawberries and syrup, really it's waffles. My second time was perfect, hot food, good coffee. This third time,c'mon who makes a dirty Chai with hot chocolate. And it was cold, so when I asked to steam it hotter he brings it and it was basically a hot chocolate, then argues that dirty Chai is made with chocolate. I've been drinking coffee longer than he's been alive and anyone knows dirty Chai is with a shot of espresso. Anyway this will not detour me from giving a LAST chance, however I hope training is in order. Thank you. I'm not mad at you, but consistency is key, \"consistently good that is\"."}
{"text":"Great waffle spot! The butter pecan waffle is really good. This is not a full service breakfast spot, just waffles or waffle sandwiches. Great treat, good coffee selections!"}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER! Crave the west coast for days!! The waffle macchiato is amazing! Tiabi is so wonderful and a great vibe. Wish they stayed open later!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with their pistachio latte.  awesome.. I had their sandwich which was awesome too."}
{"text":"Great little place, food was good, coffee was excellent. No-frills fee, limited seating - but a great breakfast. Waffle breakfast sandwiches were good. Will be back for sure. First had TIABI at the Maryland Pkwy location."}
{"text":"Good breakfast...the waffles are okay, not great but well made...all the items we tried did not disappoint...if you want a change in breakfast this is good alternative..."}
{"text":"Traveled off the strip on our Vegas trip to this cute little waffle shop and we were not disappointed. We got the Viva Las Elves waffle and the Bananatela waffle. (I substituted the Nutella  for chocolate) Both were excellent !!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place when I need a carb (waffle) fix.  LOVE the recipe (though they could bring back the almond flavor) and they have vegetarian selections which is great for my friends who follow that lifestyle.  We can all enjoy a day out together."}
{"text":"Offers vegan options 

Had the vegan wafflewich and the twilight lavender latte... Amazing will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place early in the morning & might I say I'm pleased I did the breakfast is amazing I ordered two waffles one for me and one for my boyfriend I didn't eat mines so my boyfriend added ice cream to it overall he said it was good I got the waffle sandwich eggs avocado tomato it was delicious just wish they had some type of sauce to add to it imagine eating a breakfast sandwich with no sauce just dry the food here is great but the wait time various i waited over an hour for a sandwich one time & the restaurant wasn't packed so give yourself some time when here"}
{"text":"Food is good, but how do you serve a waffle with no butter  not as enjoyable so there's that, hopefully my server is more aware next time"}
{"text":"Great coffee drinks horrible service. Wait over a hour for waffles and fake eggs. Under manned and over priced . Not sure if I would go back. But the coffee cake BZB was fire! Luke the thought of the wafflewich but dry and needs a real egg....  which would also make it less dry if the egg was over easy."}
{"text":"Another win. I love finding hidden gems when home, traveling for business or pleasure. From the moment we walked in until the \"Goodbye\" we received when we left Tiabi, i was called to tell the world, from my Instagram post and first snap of the morning. The atmosphere is refreshing. Music was on point. Food and coffee were flavorful and unique. They have vegan and vegetarian options. Tiabi really caters toward any pallet. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very convenient and friendly atmosphere,2nd time coming here and it's great to walk in and order right away"}
{"text":"The lightest, crispiest waffle I've ever had wrapped around delicious bacon, basil and a perfect, flavorful tomato. Friendly staff, cool artwork. Great environment to enjoy a fantastic breakfast. You simply have to try this place."}
{"text":"Best place for coffee !! Better than Starbucks !! Mika and lueck are always awesome sorry but don't really know everyone else's name yet lol I work next to them at Sakana. So I always get big orders from them and they are always awesome and everything I try is always good ! Gingerbread man frappe with expresso is my new favorite must try !!"}
{"text":"I came to Tiabi to scope it out for future use with my dessert meet up. I am not hugely familiar with that area, but it was easy enough to find. Up the street from the Boulevard Mall, in the Target parking lot. 

When I arrived I was kind of nervous because we were the only people there on a Saturday around 4pm. I took the lack of business as a bad sign, but I was wrong!! Maybe not enough people know about it?? I'm not sure, but if you aren't going to Tiabi, you are totally missing out.

As I said, this was a recon mission, so I had to order a little of everything, right?? We ordered 3 of the Wafflenuts - the white chocolate macadamia, the red velvet, and a vanilla one that wasn't listed on the menu. For waffles we got the Strawberry Kiss, but instead of strawberries we subbed bananas (on a Belgian waffle) and customized a classic waffle with blueberries and white chocolate. Everything was fantastic!! Everything was cooked to order perfectly. Hot, melty, sweet and so delicious!! I almost always get a to go box, and this is one of the few times ever that it was so good...I couldn't stop. No to go box needed.

The have lots more on the menu I would like to try...including their coffees. I am excited to go back. I, also, heard there might be ice cream coming in the near future. Fingers crossed!!

You should definitely check them out. They are worth a drive even if you don't live down that way. They are pretty affordable...$20 for everything I ordered plus a bottle of water. Portions are perfect...not too big or too small. The establishment is clean and relaxed. They have games and decks of cards on the table should the mood strike. Staff is super friendly and helpful.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is extremely particular when it comes to his morning coffee and this place was as close to his Illy cup he makes at home. We weren't planning on eating breakfast here until the owner told us they had gluten free waffles!!! The chef thoroughly cleaned the waffle maker for 10 minutes before making our waffles. It was well worth the wait and he did it right in front of us ( the kitchen is open).  
The owner is welcoming and told us they have vegan and gluten free items. I also noticed they had bakery items (from a different maker) that are gf and vegan. 
I ate the wafflewich with eggs, cheese, and turkey sausage. Yummy! Best of all, The (regular) waffle was flawless: warm, crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Even better dipped into the tasty maple syrup!  
My boyfriend got the gf waffle. He loved  that the whipped butter was soft and spread evenly. Melted right away!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Fantastic coffee (pistachio and their notorious waffle coffees were amazing!) Waffle breakfast sandwiches were terrific. They ran out of turkey sausage which sucks, but even with bacon, the sandwich was really good! Would highly recommend! Affordable and great tasting food and coffee."}
{"text":"I'm glad I came across this place. local spots are much more engaging with customers and the vibe and atmosphere is great if you want to enjoy some good espresso.  

Super friendly and the food is tasty...crispy to perfection."}
{"text":"The vegan waffles are to die for! My only complaint is that the service is quite slow, so make sure you have plenty of time scheduled for your meal."}
{"text":"I've had a waffle sandwich!  Bucket list item completed.  The West Coast Wafflewich was excellent.  Great combination of chicken, bacon and avocado.  Nice coffee selection as well.  Tiabi is a nice spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner or anywhere in between.  Fast Wifi connection too.  Sign me up."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique! Their selection of both coffee and waffles is nothing I have ever seen before. I love that. We got the Snickers Iced Coffee and Twilight Lavender Latte. Snickers Iced Coffee is smooth and tasty with chocolate and caramel. My husband's latte was out of this world. Never would I have thought Lavender in a coffee would taste so amazing. It's a subtle end note that really makes the drink shine. Our Maple Bacon and Strawberry Kisses Waffles were perfectly crisp. The toppings were just enough to add some except flavors, but didn't over power the delicious taste of the waffles themselves. Overall, very impressed! Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We just discovered it and ate here twice in two days. The waffles are the perfect mix of soft and crispy. I had one folded into a sandwich with bacon egg and cheese. The bacon was crispy and eggs fluffy. So good! We also tried the butter pecan waffle with candied pecans on top. The best! To top it off, their coffee drinks are delicious too. And in cool flavors like coconut truffle, honey nutmeg, or lavender latte. They aren't too sugary, and the espresso is awesome. They have cool tea flavors too. I want to try them all!"}
{"text":"This is a very small place with two ladies working the orders.  They are pretty slow, but everything is made fresh to order. They have playing cards on the table, and after a 20 minute wait, we found out why. 

I got the Mango tea, which was very good.  I am not a big sweets person so I put very little sweet and low in my tea if any.  This flavor did not need any sweetener. 

Then I ordered their B.A.T. on waffle instead of bread. It was just ok.  The waffle seemed overdone to me and the sandwich was lacking taste.  Nice fruit side bowl, but strawberries were on their last leg. 

I think most of the positive reviews were for the waffle desserts. So if I ever come back again, then I will stick to the sweet side of the menu, even though sweets are not my favorite."}
{"text":"Awesome! Very delicious , try the maple bacon waffle. I'd say if you came here on your work lunch and it's crowded, you might not get out in time, but otherwise it's a great place to cone chill, have a great coffee and a waffle."}
{"text":"Well done guys! We had the kisses and viva la Elvis and they were great!!! The viva bacon and not too salty although I was expecting really salty. We didn't have any of the gourmet drinks but definitely enjoyed the cafe like feel."}
{"text":"Still full of Awesomeness...no matter which waffle I try I have yet to be disappointed.  And you can get anything you want gluten free and vegan.

On this particular visit 3-7-16 I believe one of the owners was in the store because the staff was not as warm and friendly as in the past.  There was a totally different vibe in here then in the past 3 or 4 visits.

Not sure what was going on but the food was still amazing, the drinks were amazing and this is a place I not only highly recommend but will come back to as well.

To me this is one of those places you just cannot seem to get enough of.  You can get breakfast or lunch stuff anytime and you always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"There's too much to say about this place! I absolutely love it if they were open longer I would be spending more money there than waffles are simply amazing tasty sweet and just hold off we should be they make their own syrup with some funky way and it's delicious always asked for extra encourage them to make bottles to sell. My favorite thing about this place is the black lemonade also known as charcoal lemonade. It's literally black and it's delicious anyone I'm way as I put drive-by I instantly think of them and have to stop so they can try it and they all love it, I wish that they came in different sizes but at this point I'm just glad that I discovered it. It's a must try, must go, must experience!"}
{"text":"There's only one waffle sandwich I order here and that's the waffledilla. It's exactly what you think it is: a waffle quesadilla. It's a subtly sweet, overly savory serving of food heaven layered in a healthy serving of cheese, chicken, and their very own Tiabi sauce all densely packed in a crispy yet soft waffle, usually accompanied with a side of deliciously flavored kettle chips (add $1.00). 

I guess the only complaint I have is that the sandwich isn't big enough to satisfy my hunger, and at $5.79, I really wish it came with two waffledillas. Heck, I'd pay a little extra if there was a special two wafflewich combo. Make this happen, guys! There are too many times where I just end up ordering two anyways."}
{"text":"I stopped in here at about 7:45am on a Tuesday to a restaurant with about 3 people seated inside.  
I was warmly greeted upon entering the door. The somewhat nondescript, simple interior had the menu on the wall.  The lady gave me a run down of the 5 Wafflewiches, point out her favorite as well as the most popular West Coast Wafflewich. 

I ordered the #Breakfastsandwich and was somewhat underwhelmed. The waffle was soft but the flavor was very distinct and there was no sauce to liven it up.  I ask for a side of the Tiabi sauce, a basil based sauce that was ok, but not a compliment for the entree but probably pretty good on another entree that had Chicken. 

I guess my biggest disappointment came from the limited menu selections and the fact that there was only one \"breakfast-like\" sandwich.   A lunchtime meal might be perceived differently. 

To their credit they had quick and friendly service, but I would have to try something else to \"wow\" me.

Would I go back? Sure. Would I make a special trip to visit this specific place? Nah."}
{"text":"Decent little spot for coffee and waffles. 
Tried this place out for the first time today. First impression as you walk in sort of an island feel. Good amount of tables/seating. Friendly customer service. We ordered a \"bananatella waffle\", which was basically a decent sized waffle with bananas, whipped cream, and a drizzle of nutella. Satisfying, however, seemed to have skimped on the nutella a bit. For my coffee, i ordered a small size drink (two shots of espresso blended with almond milk and ice) It was made perfectly to order. 
Two stars missing are for the price, my small coffee beverage cost over $5 and i was just a little disappointed by the meager amount of nutella on my \"bananatella\" waffle. 
Overall, would probably not return due to the price of the coffee, even though i did enjoy it. :/"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Nothing better then eating at a place with good food and smiles from the whole staff. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Churro waffle is really good! Cute little shoppe! Glad it's in North LV! Wish they used real eggs and bacon. The eggs are microwaved I think? I just think those little extra touches would make this place a 5 star eatery. Overall, good experience! Friendly staff. Espresso is good as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to do some work i with tables and Wi-Fi and came across Tiabi.

Had a great early dinner here consisting of the recommended West Coast Wafflewich with housemade chips and a Just Peachy iced tea (with less sweetener).  The Wafflewich was good (wasn't the biggest fan of the tomatoes, as I felt it was too much of a soft component, I took them out and replaced them with some chips and added the crunch I was looking for) and the peach tea was great. (next time, I'll get all the sweetener--who am I kidding). 

Later, I additionally had an Almond Milk Green Tea Latte and it's possibly my favorite Green Tea Latte I've ever had.  It was refreshingly nutty and not overly sweet.

The owners who had served me were great and friendly personalities and I can't wait to come back here again with others."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! the food is delicious and the service is always so friendly and welcoming. i'll recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Waffle flavor is on point. Vegan options are available. They were out of vegan ice cream last time but I'll be back in to try it soon. Try the Oreo coffee. Soooo delishiousness and the environment is chill. My only complaint is that I wish they had longer hours."}
{"text":"Amazing small business owned by 2 women of Guam!! I first found this place in search of white espresso! I moved here from Seattle so you can imagine we are well known for our love for coffee. Anyway, the yummy looking food and coffee pictures is what summoned my family and I! As we pulled up we seen a Guam sticker proudly represented on the entry way! It made me feel proud to be a Chamorru but even prouder to see a small uniquely owned island business in sin city! Strange how this place stuck out and so happened to be of the same cultural background. Amazing customer service by the young lady and man who was working. She thoroughly explained good items in which we were interested in regardless of how many questions we threw at her. I myself being a server in the food industry know how tedious it could be. We ordered a few items off the menu! 
Red velvet waffle 
Maple and beacon waffle 
Southwest waffle sandwich
Banananutella
And the Tia waffle iced mac. Coffee

All tasted lovely and reasonably priced! Go support a small island owned business!"}
{"text":"Really cool they have real freshly made waffles. The works are super polite. Got the breakfast sandwich with beacon and eggs. Too bad the eggs and beacon are industrial made thousands of miles away. They taste and look totally unfresh. Too bad."}
{"text":"It is a cute little cafe. I used the yelp eat24, and it was ready by the time it say it would. I ordered the red velvet waffles, and it was soo good. This food here is really good"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite and pick me up so decided to try Tiabi's on my lunch break. It wasn't busy at all and I was glad that the service was great! The guy who took my order was helpful and friendly, it made the ordering process easy. 

I ordered the signature drink - Tiff's and it was good, I like the top off of a cinnamon waffle! I ordered a savory sandwich (forgot what it was called but it had chicken cheese avocado and the house sauce) it was pretty good. 

They have a decent selection of drinks and quick eats, I'd go back if I was in the mood for waffles.

Overall the quality of food was good, the staff was friendly. The only critique is when I sat down the bench was wobbling and the table was sticky."}
{"text":"One of the reasons I love living mid town! Had the west coast wafflewich, sooo good! Something about a fresh waffle folded around seasoned chicken breast, avocado, tomato, bacon, melted cheese, and with the signature Tiabi sauce. Do your taste buds a favor."}
{"text":"This has to be the best place to get waffles. They always come out perfect. I ordered through postmates and it still came perfect. Even the iced coffee. Usually when you order a drink through delivery it gets watered down by the ice but nope still great!"}
{"text":"Absolute best place to get waffles in Vegas. The waffle has an excellent texture and is soo tasty. The whipped cream on the top is one of the best parts.
The sandwiches are also really good. 
The kale champ smoothie is good if you're a fan of kale. If you don't like kale try a fruity smoothie because you can still taste it.
So far I haven't had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"SOOO good! I got the Elvis waffle- very good. Great staff!!! The manager is literally the nicest person in the world- Recommend this 100% !!!"}
{"text":"Service: Quick, friendly, and helpful. 

Our banana berry came out within a few minutes of ordering ($5.25). The smoothie wasn't icy at all and you could actually taste all the ingredients they put into the drink, unlike most places. IMO, $5.25 is a lot for a smoothie, but I would say it was well worth it's price.

I also ordered the west coast ($5.99). I was torn between the steak and egg waffle (a new addition to the menu) vs the west coast. I went with the west coast since the person at the register suggested it and I'm glad I did.

The west coast was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The avocado didn't over power the sandwich which I feel most sandwiches do. It was definitely enough to make me full since I also ordered a side of house chips. The house chips tasted like kettle cooked mesquite bbq chips, but they season it themselves kinda like potato corner. Would recommend. We have a place like this in Cali called Bruxie's, but I'd rather come here because their items are more flavorful. 

P.S. They play a variety of girl power songs from Ciara, Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, Destiny's Child, etc... lol"}
{"text":"I love visiting the location off Maryland, great staff, friendly environment, exceptional food! This location is another story. Same look except for the quality and environment, was very disappointed by the staff and quality of the food. Sad that this location was so terrible as I love the other location."}
{"text":"Nice little spot off the strip, 5 minutes away. Located in the same center as Target. Workers are very welcoming and hospitable. Waffles are fresh and crisp. Very delicious."}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe that I found on Groupon. I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon & a sugar free vanilla latte. This place really does a good job catering to gluten and sugar free lifestyles. The food is delicious, the portion size was a bit much but its something that can be saved for later and still taste great, if you go for lunch it's best to order ahead of time, everything is cooked to order. Love This Place!"}
{"text":"Smells great and decent pricing for a waffle bar. Busy staff so may take a while to get food."}
{"text":"I died and went to red velvet heaven! Place is amazing from the customer service, their drinks to their waffle. Would definitely be back"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I wrote a review, but I wanted to write one about my favorite cafe - TIABI.

TIABI - \"To Inspire And Be Inspired\". I discovered this little place through a student organization at UNLV. They are super close to campus and an excellent place to \"be inspired,\" in my case this is the only place where I know I can sit down and focus on writing and studying. I've been here several times already and have accomplished so much (yelping reviews is the bottom of my list up until now). 

First, the only downside I can mention is that there is only one wall outlet (that I know) where I can plug in. That little area has become my personal spot. Other than that, I thoroughly love this venue.

Location/Open times: TIABI is down the street from UNLV. It is in a secluded area of the Target shopping plaza right next to a great sushi place. As a potential schoolteacher, the 7am open time is right when I have to get to class but it is open until 8pm on most days making it a good place to have breakfast on my off days, lunch, or chillax after class/work.

Aesthetics: Local art, waffle \"hashtags\" everywhere, a couple of couches and sturdy tables and seating. The wired art light fixtures  add a nice rustic look (though they tend to accumulate dust quickly). Nothing is too distracting, and I can zone into my work or a conversation easily. Their playlists are provided by Pandora and varies by the people working, but I have enjoyed the musical tastes of the staff thus far, ranging from islander to indie.

Food: In the words of a lego dude, \"EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!\" There are plenty of options, especially health and allergy conscious, handcrafted on the spot. I have always enjoyed that \"fresh\" taste and have never suffered a regretful feeling leaving (as is sometimes the case with Chipotle or even Starbucks). As I am writing this review, I am having their red velvet waffle (so sweet and delectable) paired with a new beverage, the Frankenstein frappe, a cool and refreshing drink lightly sweetened with agave but not so much as to overpower the taste of the coffee. I am enjoying myself and am getting my morning kick (which is why I can write). 

Service: The owners, Tiff and Mae, are both super awesome and have taken care of me on numerous occasions. Their staff are just as kind and sociable, and I haven't had a problem striking up a conversation as I am often here alone. I feel as welcome as sitting at a desk in my own living room. I'm surprised that not as many people come to just hang out, but I'm certain that will change as more people come to know about TIABI.

I like small hole-in-the-wall local places, and I feel especially at home at this one. Hope this review was inspiring!"}
{"text":"Small but fun. Extensive waffle menu. I had the Viva Las Elvis (banana, peanut butter and bacon). Their coffee and latte selection is also extensive and way less expensive than STARBUCKS. The only negative is, since it's all made to order, it's not quick. But still, really good and fun and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Cool ,cute, unpretentious lovely little place with wonderful workers, chef making waffle with his heart , taste all good ingredients are using for the creative waffle sandwiches , the honey creamy latte is fantastic 
The owner and workers there so pleasant, friendly and passionate about what they are doing, I respect people like that. They got it right , focus on few things and make it toward perfection!
I am going again tomorrow try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My Viva Las Elvis was amazing and my snickers coffee yummy loved the bathroom  great find"}
{"text":"All the things I love: coffee, tea, and waffles!! Once you walk in, you immediately know that you're in for a great experience. With everything prepared to order, the food and drinks are fresh and high quality. 

They have a very interesting coffee menu with things like red velvet lattes. The flavors offered are rich and well executed. 

This has a small cafe environment with open seating for all people. The clean and friendly environment makes for a great meeting or work space. Free Wi-Fi is offered for your internet needs."}
{"text":"The location is not the best however the customer service was stellar. Cleanliness was fair. We had Tiff's Waffle Macchiato. It was excellent! Sweet, decadent, full of flavor and the waffle was delicious. I would definitely return to restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but both were good experiences. I ordered a caramel iced coffee but she heard it as an iced caramel macchiato. I didn't end up correcting her since I figured it wouldve tasted the same lol. I also ordered the red velvet waffle with no whip. The food and the coffee was good but nothing spectacular. 

When my waffle came out, the girl put whipped cream on it. I didn't complain about it but I was a little irked lol. The girl did apologize later on so it was fine. The workers are really nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I love that it's not super busy. The waffles are so soft and fluffy and perfect. I plan on coming back many many times. I attend UNLV and it is so close to campus that it is perfect for an after school lunch, snack, coffee, etc."}
{"text":"This is a small 3 person operation.  My wife ordered the bananatella Belgian waffle with a nutella drizzle, slivered almonds and whipped cream topping.  I sought nirvana by ordering a hashtag breakfast sandwich - Belgian waffle with turkey sausage, eggs and cheese.  I enhanced my sandwich with a generous douse of breakfast syrup.  Both entrees were very good as was the strawberry sunrise smoothie that we ordered to go."}
{"text":"I really like the concept and service at TIABI. Laid back atmosphere where you can hang out solo or with friends. There are people working on their laptops or hanging out with friends. Their specialty is their vegan waffle. Either sweet or savory they have options for both.

There is a a big board on the left when you walk in for the menu. The customer service at the ordering  counter has been consistently friendly. I've had the West Coast waffle sandwich and that has chicken, avocado, bacon, and their signature aioli sauce. I really like it, but sometimes I get it without the bacon. Their chicken waffledilla is a quesadilla made out of waffle instead of tortilla. Very cheesy and hits the spot when you're in need of comfort food. The only drawback is that sometimes the food takes a while to come out. I've tried calling ahead for pick up, but was put on hold for a while and ended up driving there instead. However, I'm never disappointed when I get my food though. 

I do want to differentiate that this particular shop has a more soft and fluffy texture than a super crispy outside kind of waffle. I personally like the softer version, but for some people the waffle texture was too one noted. I have yet to try their dessert versions, but the strawberry and whipped cream seems to be very popular when I've dined in. The prices are very affordable too. Lunch with a drink will be around under ten bucks. All in all, it's a cool and casual spot worth giving at least a try. May call way ahead of time before the busy lunch hour, but it's definitely on my rotation of lunch options."}
{"text":"Needed to kill some time yesterday in the area so decided to give this place a try. Had the Elvis waffle which was ok but had way too much peanut butter for my taste and pretty much overwhelmed everything else. Also tried the snickers iced coffee which was excellent. Service was friendly but slow. We waited about 15 minutes for our coffee and then at least another 20 for the waffle. Definitely not the place to come if you are in a hurry. Luckily I wasn't in a rush or starving. Overall decent but not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"Table was wobbly and not cleaned off, vegan burger came without sauce and was just two boca burger patties with tomato and lettuce between a waffle. Dessert churro waffle came with perfect scoop ice cream but only one waffle for $7.50.  Not worth the drive in my opinion when there are much better places nearby."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan options! The guru burger is great. I'm not the biggest fan of Daiya but it's good on this burger. Iced coffee is also great. It's also very cute inside and quiet, which I appreciate because I went in for breakfast. Much better than some coffee shops with loud music or loud customers. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"After seeing other great reviews for Tiabi on Yelp, I finally ventured out to check it out! Parking was a bit of a tight squeeze as this location is crammed in with other small businesses next to Target, but the restaurant itself was quiet and laidback. 

I decided to try the Red Velvet frappe, which the employees upgraded to a large for me for free because it was my first time! Nice! The frappe was delicious but a little too sweet for me to drink the whole thing. 

Now that I know where Tiabi is and have had a good experience with the employees, I definitely want to come back and try the waffles and other drinks."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time! Nice and clean on the inside. I order the West coast waffle it was delicious. Everyone in our group loved the food. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite cafes to study at! They have a great selection of food, especially my favorite, the West Coast. Definitely can't go wrong with a waffle sandwich to begin with. The music isn't too loud and the feel of this place is very relaxed and chill. Their WiFi is good and not laggy whatsoever. They have lots of table room, which I definitely like taking advantage of when needing to study and catch up on homework. Wished they stayed open longer, but what can you do? Overall, a great place to grab a bite while studying for those exams. Always leaving focused and content after coming here! :-)"}
{"text":"Introduction:
Always looking for a good coffee place. Came across Tiabi on Groupon and decided to try them out.  I must say, it was delicious. 

Quality: 5/5
We had the snicker \"iced coffee\" and  the honey \"I'm home waffle\".  They were both equally good.  The coffee had the perfect sweetness and so was the waffle. However, if I must rate between the two, I enjoyed the waffle  slightly better. 

Quantity: 4/5
For the price, I think it's good, but not great. Although the large coffee was plenty, I usually see that as a medium size. So fyi, in case you are considering a small. It's really good, so I recommend the large.

Customer Service: 4/5
Nothing spectacular, although there was only two parties in there including us, we were not acknowledged when we walked in like most places do with incredible customer experience.  However, they were good once we were assisted.

Atmosphere: 5/5
It was kind of cold in there, there were us and one other couple that was in the shop. Mainly because we went about 4:30 p.m. Coffee shops are not known to be busy during that hour.  The music volume was however perfect tone. Not too loud or too soft.
 
Cleanliness: 4/5
The place appeared a little older, but was clean and organize.

Price: 5/5
The price was good, however, we got Groupon promotions, so it made their pricing exceptional :)

Tips:
You can get three $8 groupons for $14.25.  So we have two left to utilize. Will definitely be back to try out their other items.  Keep an eye out,  It's located in a plaza, so it's not a stand alone coffee shop. We almost missed it. Enjoy! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this venue as it's a small business & the items on the menu seem fairly tasty,  but the service was lacking. 

We came with a family of four. The kids were served their food & finished eating (20 minutes) before the other food arrived. I was truly floored!  The kids initially wanted to wait for our food to arrive, however, had they waited their food would have been cold. 

We also ordered a side of eggs & bacon to accompany the waffles we ordered. That too was served 20 minutes apart. 

The hostess/owner apologized & said their was a \"mixup\" but I wasn't impressed with the lack of concern that was given with our poor dining experience. 


I know this is a new venue & only opened a month ago but sometime & effort really needs to be put into the flow of business. We came to eat as a family & that did not happen. I'm extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is cute. It is catered to college crowd. The prices are pretty darn good. I ordered Tiffs special that included a caramel macchiato and small waffle garnish. You can get it iced or hot. It was 4.25! My friend ordered a waffle with chocolate and strawberries and a green smoothie. The waffle was a bit dry and smoothie was very light. But the prices and vibe in here was good enough to try again."}
{"text":"Second time at Tiabi and we keep falling in love with the menu. The fresh brewed coffee is amazing. If you are Vegan then enjoy the Veggie Waffledilla that's on the menu. The snickers iced coffee is also a must. 

Come here...enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy the food. Tiabi has the best waffles in the area...and they're 100% Vegan!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was actually a little bland, waffles had no flavor to them unfortunately, my sister & I got the red velvet waffle to share, she got the vegan sandwich & I got the breakfast sandwich. If the breakfast sandwich didn't have bacon on it, I would've tasted like I was eating nothing. 

Coffee was excellent definitely would return just for the coffee alone. Great atmosphere & the ladies working were very pleasant. Just wish the food had more flavor."}
{"text":"Best waffle spot in Vegas.  Hands down. The waffledilia with avocado is always a good choice.  The Thai basil waffle is also tasty and zesty"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The staff is so nice and welcoming but the best part is the variety of unique waffles. You must try the Maple Bacon Waffle and the Red Velvet (so yummy and to die for). 

I can't wait to return and try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Um can I just start by saying this is freaking delicious I was suppose to be on a diet but that has failed as of today. Greta little shop, friendly staff. The west coast was beyond amazing. The sauce is delicious over all. I just have to say that this is an amazing place to come grab a sandwich or a drink it's just delicious."}
{"text":"Time to update. Yesterday's visit wasn't very pleasing. I cannot believe how long it took to get my food...and the nice gal at the cashier took down my name incorrectly so after waiting an excruciating long time for my food, I wasn't sure if my name was being called. They keep calling \"Maria\" when my name is \"Nadia\"...I looked around and noticed no one was responding to \"Maria\" so I went up to the counter to clarify the name...With an attitude, one of the girls making a drink said \"isn't that what you  ordered?\" (as if the sandwich was exclusive to me alone)... I said \"yes, but before I take the food I want to make sure it's actually my order and not some Maria that could be nearby\". After taking the food I sat down and immediately overheard the same girls  gossiping about me, laughing and saying my name. Whatever. At least wait until the customer leaves to trash talk. The Thai sandwich was just okay. The waffle was too soft and when I bit into it it was unpleasantly soggy. It's been that way on each visit. The idea of a waffle sandwich is good, by if it isn't cooked crispy enough, it ends up tasting like dough. I think I'm going to scratch this place off my list."}
{"text":"Cool spot + unique menu but not the best service. My mom had 3 things wrong with her simple order and five minutes after she we began eating someone else came in to return their meal as well as their Togo order was cooked improperly. Maybe would be better if a new cook were in the back."}
{"text":"Dang ... finally a place dedicated just waffles ... The Bananatella and Waffledilla is awesome..."}
{"text":"I wanted to pick up some morning macchiatos, so my friend suggested I try out Tiabi. I was greeted by the friendly cashier who was open to answering all of my first time client questions. I ordered two regular caramel macchiatos and also received a macadamia/caramel Lolly waffle for checking in. The macchiatos barely had a caramel taste, but did showcase the fresh coffee it was made with. Definitely better quality and more refreshing than any chain coffee shop. The Lolly waffle was satisfying but had an awful amaretto after taste and was undercooked in the center. If they gave their waffle maker a good scrubbin' and ditched the almond tang, I think the lolly waffle could have a chance to be great. Overall, the customer service was friendly and coffee was tasty, but the lolly waffle and cleanliness of the establishment need improvement."}
{"text":"This place is near the UNLV campus and is amazing. I go about every other week with one of my good friends. 

I really like this place and the food is delicious and all fresh made. I am a big fan of avocado and a lot of there waffle-witches have avocado on them an its so appetizing and filling. They have man options too, including vegan options which is really nice. This is perfect for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. They have amazing coffee too. The drinks are so yummy and cute. They have a special menu in front of the cash register as well. They have a lavender vanilla latte that is so yummy and it has a soft lavender flavor. Also, I am not a big fan of honey but they have a honey creme latte that is so soft and decadent. It makes me smile and it is perfect.

The workers are also very friendly! They are also so nice and help out.

This place is serve yourself though, so they make the food and the coffee but you get the utensils and the maple syrup on a table across from where you pick up the food. 

They are always packed in the morning when I go and I really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"We found this place on Groupon it is Delicious if you are in Vegas you need to stop in we (4 of us) had the Butter Pecan Waffle, Wafflewiches, Strawberry kisses, latte, macchiato OMG this was awesome.  The staff was the best J is so cool. Will visit when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that the waffles were 100% vegan! It's tough to find good breakfast places with vegan options. The coffee is great the waffles are great and the vegan ice cream? Awesome. I'll be coming back here every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service / good vibes / great food.


Pros: 

-Both Vegan & non Vegan friendly

-They have a all flavors for those who love sweet & savory as well.

-good music

-comfy seating

-VERY CLEAN 


CON: 

I can't find any to be honest"}
{"text":"The waffles are magic in your mouth. I'm not a big waffle fan, but this place does it right. Crispy on the outside and nice and airy on the inside. There's a variety of waffle sandwiches and waffle desserts and the coffee choices makes it hard to pick just one."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab lunch before heading on our long road trip ahead.

We ordered a coffee, Snickers drink, 2 wafflewichs.

We sat and waited and waited. There were 2 people working only.

We waited about 30 minutes before getting our drinks. Then another 10 minutes for our food.

My drink was okay, but my guy said his coffee was good though.

The wafflewichs were okay, but a bit soggy. Definitely use the syrup since I think it enhances the flavors. The fruit were strawberries and bananas, but the strawberries weren't that ripe. I did enjoy the chips."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I ordered the West Coast waffle sandwich and my first bite was the bomb. This place is tasty and affordable! Definitely get the West Coast!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful coffee spot with reasonable prices! Super friendly staff! Definitely gonna come back and chill :)"}
{"text":"Not particularly fond of this place. 

My friend got the lavender latte, while I got a cappuccino. The lavender latte was good, not too sweet and had a good taste of the espresso. Mine tasted only like a shot of burnt espresso.

I'm giving 3/5 stars for the concept, but I won't be a regular"}
{"text":"Food was good, place was decent, waiting for waffles to be prepared was a bit tooooo long. With lots of good reviews, they need to buy more waffle makers to speed up service"}
{"text":"A churro waffle?? What a goldmine! Was craving a midday snack so I dragged Mom and sister out to try it out. 

Looking at yelp reviews, I expected it to be more or less a Belgian waffle with cinnamon and sugar (which still sounds delicious). However, this waffle was much thinner than a Belgian. This kept it nice and crunchy, even with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

Super delicious! And the staff was very friendly. I'll have to again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Veggie waffle is dope. Good job on the flavor and the yummski factor. The tiffs waffle macchiato was tasty!!! 

Friendly people clean place!!!"}
{"text":"Walking in you are bombarded with the smell of deliciousness that is waffles. I would go there just to soak in the aroma, it smells that good. Unfortunately, I can't eat the food there because it's not gluten free, so my review is based upon the coffee I got. My friend and I decided to come here because it was a local coffee shop and it wasn't Starbucks. Not a fan of their coffee. Tiabi's coffee selection was pretty good but their waffle selection was better. They had creative coffee drinks like the Jolt and the Snicker's bar which I got. My drink was ok...it a little more on the mocha side than I would've preferred but my friend's drink was amazing. I would definitely go back and get the Jolt next time I'm in Vegas. Definitely check this little coffee shop out. It's got a cool concept going on and who doesn't love waffles?!"}
{"text":"Omnomnomnom. We came here after reading a review on a vegan website. I'm the only vegan so we love finding yummy places that have vegan options. 

We had the new vegan waffle burger, a caramel syrup macchiato with almond milk, a hashtag breakfast sandwich with bacon waffles, kisses waffle, and a strawberry sunrise smoothie. Everything was nom to the max (see first line). The sauce with the new vegan burger sandwich was amazing and we loved everything else. 

The employees were very friendly and we loved playing cards while our food came. Thanks, Tiabi, for a great breakfast and living up to the hype! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! My boyfriend and I got waffle breakfast sandwiches: one bacon and the other turkey sausage. Both reasonably priced and delicious!!! We also got a strawberry chocolate waffle, yummy and fresh berries. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Great first time experience, great customer service, food was amazing. I would definitely recommend others to come and enjoy the vibes. My meal of choose today was the Strawberry KISS Waffle, substituting the chocolate for caramel and adding bananas. I definitely enjoyed the food and it is inexpensive and offers cafe vibes and music. It is also great that they offer vegan friendly options. This is the perfect brunch restaurant and a great way to start your day.    The atmosphere is wonderful."}
{"text":"First time here and they are really good. Super nice, make modifications with no problem. The ambiance is cafe-ish and has a friendly vibe to it. The food is fresh and tasty. #awesome"}
{"text":"Well, it's lunch time again at the office. Joe came in my office and asked if I wanted waffles for lunch, I was like that seems odd, but Joe is a standup guy so I trusted him, and I was down for an adventure after my extremely boring day so far. So we loaded up a couple cars or coworkers and we rolled on over. The inside of the place was cool, actually it was a little cold. I liked the painting of princess leia and Vader. They have a waffle sandwich named the West coast, which is what I got, mainly because I like to say \"West Coast\" in my white \"Gangsta\" accent. They have Mexican coke in \"medio litro\" sizes, that was good. Exp date on it was august of 2017, so that gives it plenty of time. I liked the music, it was like a funky sax beat that got my jiggy flowing. Jami got the Guru Burger, she said \"it's delicious\" Joe said his waffle was \"primo\" he got the strawberry kisses or something. \"The kettle chips are delicious\" - Jami. Alex said the Guru burger was \"good so far\" Jamie said the Strawberry kisses was \"really good!\" Byoungha said about the WestCoast \"it's good....real good\" In addition they had playing cards at our table, me Jordan, Alex, and  Sarah played \"go fish\", Jordan won with 8 matches."}
{"text":"Omggggg!! I didn't like waffles until this place!! These crispy light waffles are a winner! I had the butter pecan waffle and it was delish..I'll be bringing all of my family and friends here!! The selection is great for vegans which isn't something I often see. They are nice too!"}
{"text":"Guru burger is the best veggie burger ive had in vegas (besides the ones I make) 

Its just a boca burger i think, but its just so delicious wrapped up in a fresh waffle! 

The vegan viva las elvis was tasty, but a bit skimpy on the toppings.

The lady who helped us was very friendly and helpful. I forgot to get her name but we went at 7 or 8 am on thursday.    

Lattes with Lots of unique flavors here (like pistacchio) 

Next time ill try the churro waffle!

I wish the prices were a bit lower or the portions a bit bigger, but overall i was very happy with my visit and cant beleive i waited 2 years to try it!!! Will def be a regualr!"}
{"text":"Tried it once out of curiosity and had to have my guests go complete their tasks while I waited for my waffles. No communication or compensation for the wait either. Food was good but the wait was not. Either the prices need to come down or the wait times do."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Churro waffles. They were luke warm. Wasn't busy, but a long wait on cooking the waffles. I watched it get peeled from the iron, placed on a cookie rack, place in a toaster oven, then peeped before serving. Simple order, but somehow it turned out mediocre. Service without the smile."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Nothing more to say than EXCELLENT! Waffles are so good! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend recently decided to go vegan, being one that would eat anything and everything he's now very cautious and needless to say I can't think of places he'd actually eat from! Searching yelp for vegan places I found this place, and I'm sooooo glad I did!!
The guru burger is what he went with and he was very satisfied! I went with the west coast and oh my goooodness
It was delicious!!!
The waffle was PERFECT
He also tried the green nut smoothie and loved it!
So happy I found this spot!
We'll definitely be stopping by again soon!"}
{"text":"Pistachio latte is bomb! I get the #breakfastsandwhich every time I come and it never disappoints. They have vegetarian and dairy free options which is a huge plus! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Pistachio latte mmmmm. The owner is super nice! I drive 40 mins to come here and it's worth it every time."}
{"text":"Delicious most unique coffee and waffle shop. With a friendly and helpful staff. Came here a couple days ago. Can't believe what I've been missing. Although I didn't have the waffle, the lavender latte was a hit, bought my daughter the charcoal infused lemonade. It's black and taste like a fantastic glass of lemonade! Pretty exciting. My husband had the java jolt. He loved it, gave him the kick he needed. We'll definitely be. Everything tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Had Groupon I purchased. A friend and I went about 10:00am. I ordered red velvet waffle, she ordered a waffle sandwich.  No one was there except us, my waffle came out in about 20 minutes, friends didn't come until about 10-15 minutes later.  Hate to start eating befire she got hers. My red velvet waffle was awful, not only missing flavor but it was dry and just had chocolate chips scattered over the top,  no butter, syrup very very dry, it was terrible, friends sandwich she was just OK. You do have to get up to get your silverware, condiments, water and napkins. Drinks are good but really need to work on flavor and moist texture. Mat just inside very dirty looks like they never vacuum it. Would not go back."}
{"text":"A delightful experience! Excellent espresso, bright environment, and it smells like the most fantastic waffles."}
{"text":"This place earns its five stars. It is so delicious.

I can't eat dairy, so waffles are often off the table for me. When I found out about this place on my last trip, I was excited but I had no idea what was waiting for me. These aren't just waffles. They are delicious, fluffy, soft waffles with just the right amount of crisp and crunch on the outside. I got the Thai chicken waffle sandwich without cheese. It was the best food I've had on my vacation by far. You can get a more classic waffle dessert with different batter options and customized toppings if you want more of a dessert. Also, yes, they have vegan ice cream. 

The drinks are nice too. I've tended to stick to tea blends to hydrate on hot days, but they have a few interesting looking blended drinks and, of course, fun coffee options.

The waffles take a little bit of time to make, so go in with a little patience, but know that it is so worth it.

I fully recommend this place to anyone with a mouth who enjoys food."}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon and had to go back! I've never tried waffles with anything other than syrup because I always thought it was weird any other way but this place proved me wrong... Their sandwiches are sooooooo good I tried both the South American and west coast & they were Delicious!!! Their coconut truffle ice coffee is LIFE! If I didn't live so far I would totally replace my everyday Starbucks with their ice coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after reading Yelp reviews (thanks!) and was so glad I did!  The Westcoast was amazing! Staff was so friendly. I'll def b back."}
{"text":"They have the best coffee in town, and if it's waffles you're after, then this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Gluten free waffles at affordable prices in Vegas? What? And Nutella? Sign me up! Great coffee for an amazing price. Staff is friendly. This hole-in-the-wall coffee shop is definitely worth venturing off the strip to go try."}
{"text":"I am seriously impressed by the quality of these waffle sandwiches - they're not just tasty, the avocado and all the ingredients I have regularly are top notch. Amazing. They may take a little time to make, BUT I promise it's worth the extra couple minutes. The owner is extremely genuine. I never review stuff - but I really am singing high praise. Been back about six or seven times. Waffle breakfast sandwiches for the win!"}
{"text":"It's been a while where I go to a new breakfast place and order something new and like it. Everything is fresh which is amazing. 

I was amazed that they had vegan options as well. 

The honey cream latter was exceptional. It blew my mind. 

I ordered the vegan waffle with daiya cheese and egg. Omg, I just can't believe how good it was! 
They should open a location in Los Angeles :))))"}
{"text":"OMG this place is so good!!! I loved their red velvet chocolate chip frappe and wafflewiches! I had the west coast wafflewich!"}
{"text":"This is the spot!  Would be nice if they went organic- and some better options for sweet syrup, but great for vegan selections while passing thru Vegas on a road trip.  

lots of fun options, especially the Churro waffle.  we had the vegan wafflewich too, it was super tasty.

chilled out space, cozy seating, good music, wifi, and outlets.  good for travelers and study"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! they have great coffee and delicious waffles! id eat there every morning if i could! the place is small and quiet and the service is friendly! give this place a shot if you havent already!"}
{"text":"We drove 20 minutes from our hotel to get to this little spot and I'm glad we did. It's unique and the waffles were worth the wait. West coast waffle and the chocolate coconut latte were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Two vegan wafflewhich choices, The Guru which I have had multiple times and always enjoyed, and the Savory Thai Basil can be made vegan with The Guru's patties and daiya vegan mozzarella. Scream for vegan ice cream!"}
{"text":"Not only does Tiabi do amazing waffles they also hold the coffee game down! \"To Inspire And Be Inspired\"! I love the quote and your food and coffee are inspirational to me!!!!

So far I have not tried the sweet waffles, but on the savory waffle front I'm in love with the Waffidilla add the avocado and the West Coast. Both full of cheese and meaty goodness inside a perfectly cooked waffle. 

The coffee is amazing! On your first visit you must have the Tiffs Waffle Macchiato. It has a churro waffle in a very strong, slightly cinnamon flavored coffee. My favorite is the Espresso Frankenstein. It's perfect if you enjoy the taste of coffee. Plus, as sweetener they use is agave. Yay!

The service is spot on and everyone is talkative, energized and helpful. If you go in often you will get to know them and how sweet they really are. The atmosphere a is pure coffee shop, random tables that don't match and chairs that are odd. I do love the long wood bench that runs the length of the wall. Plus, the cool art on the walls are really unique and cool. 

My love of coffee shops runs deep and Tiabi Coffee has definitely become close to my heart!"}
{"text":"Second time here and second yelp review. This place let's you basically make your own smoothie!! You can pick what goes in it and what you want to leave out. Plus it's very decently priced. Ironically cheaper than Jamba Juice and Tropical Smoothie even though it uses real fruit when the other chains DON'T."}
{"text":"I ordered the West Coast. It came with chicken, tomato, bacon, avocado, and their tiabi sauce. The sauce was really good! I was a little disappointed with the waffle itself. Very bland. Luckily the filling was tasty! My boyfriend ordered the Viva Las Vegas. Very good but again, not the best waffle. 
We ordered a Red Bull iced drink which was pretty tasty if you like Red Bull. I had the caramel mocha coffee with a pinch of sea salt. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Just had a sugar free frappe , hazelnut. Quite good. They give you a choice 5 of many different types of milk, so that's nice to be able to choose.  Nice atmosphere. .. no smoking.  Music not too loud."}
{"text":"TIABI is in a niche of its own! Where in the valley can you find great tasting waffle sandwiches??? Nowhere! Love, love, love them! You will too!"}
{"text":"I love exploring new vegan friendly places when visiting Vegas and this is def one to try. They are friendly and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I had their best seller, Banana Nutella waffle and Caramel Machiato. 
Waffle was good, coffee too. Ambiance is alright, casual but the music was a bit too loud. 
I'd like to come back to try their savory items."}
{"text":"I had the Thai Basil (vegan) and the Honey I'm Home (vegan version). SO DELICIOUS.
That Honey I'm Home had my cravings going for weeks!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is definitely my new favorite breakfest spot!!! The restaurant is tucked in behind the target shopping center. Tiabi is decorated way beautifully and have a very interesting beverage, smoothie, and food menu! I wish I could try everything on the menu so I will be back! The food was amazing and the staff were SOOOOOO nice and friendly!! :)"}
{"text":"I went here only because Waffle Cafe was closed. We got there 45 mins before close and they told us they shut down the dining area 15 minutes before closing time. They honestly looked shocked we even came in at that time. As a family of four, we spent about $60 four waffles, four drinks and the thinnest pieces of bacon I've ever seen. Needless to say we left hungry. They brought out one waffle at a time and my husband almost didn't get his food in time for us to eat there. We rushed to eat and get out in time not to get kicked out. They weren't flat out rude but I wouldn't call them friendly either. Well that is until we were leaving and then it was like \"bye have a great night!\" Honestly I would never go back. I get way better service, way better food and for less at Waffle Cafe. I've never left there hungry and I have even heard them training their staff and the owner repeatedly mentioned customer service. Plus it's much more comfortable and cleaner in Waffle Cafe. I wouldn't waste my time going here unless you aren't that hungry and you have money to blow."}
{"text":"Very good! I got the bananatella waffle it taste Soo good. My boyfriend got the vegan veggie burger and it was decently good to for someone who doesn't like vegan food at all."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM WAFFFLLESSS!! But really, the waffles are amazing. And the lattes I had were pretty darn good."}
{"text":"This was an unbelievably pleasant surprise. I stopped in for a cup of coffee and felt indulgent so I added a Maple Bacon waffle to the order. Holy moly!  Best waffle I've ever had!  And the Americano was delightful as well. I'd return in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"First time here in Vegas and this place was recommended. . My fiancé got the guru burger and I got the bananatella.. apparently Wednesday's are waffle Wednesday's!! Anyways this place is great! The environment is soooo welcoming and they girls that were here were so friendly ! I didn't get their names :/ the food was just as great as the service !! Thank you guys for being part of my first Vegas trip !!! I'll be back when ever I'm in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it is great! The waffles are really good, I never know what to order because everything sounds delicious. Would recommend if you are in the area! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day and really enjoyed it. I got the Guru Burger and thought it was quite good- this is definitely a compliment from me because, honestly, I'm not usually a huge fan of waffle sandwichs! My previous waffle sandwich experiences have always left me feeling like I could have made the sandwich at home with two Eggo waffles (and it, honestly, would have probably been easier to eat than the folded, taco-ish style they all go for!). This waffle sandwich blew my Eggo creations to the wayside- their waffles are really flavorful and fluffy, better than I've had in ages. I also had one of their seasonal lattes- the Fa La La Latte, because I'm a sucker for anything mint!- and a bit of the lavender latte on accident... which, leads me to my only complaint about this place. I came with a friend who has a very similar sounding name to mine and when the barista called out her name, we both thought it was mine because I had ordered a few minutes before her... well, we were definitely wrong! I thought the latte didn't have much mint to it (but it was damn good, either way!) but didn't think anything of it until the barista called out my name followed by the name of my latte about 5 minutes later. That could have been avoided so easily just by writing the name on the cup. Having to remake a drink sucks way more than taking the 5 seconds to write a name on the cup! Either way, great coffee and great waffles- would recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Today was the second time going and it was yet another bad experience. This time I drove 10 minutes there to find out they were closed when their hours posted were 7am. It was 730 with no one in sight. Last time I stood there for 15 minutes to get two coffees. Customer service is awful there and the coffee is subpar. They will not be getting another chance."}
{"text":"The setup of the cafe is nice, there's large tables for big groups to comfortably sit at, complete with a deck of playing cards to entertain you until your food is ready. There's lots of chalk writing on the walls with a bunch of UNLV references and other scrabble, which gives it a local and laid-back feel. It was kinda cool but the colors get obnoxious if you stare at them for too long.

I was pretty impressed with the waffles here. I ordered a sugary cinnamon one, and my boyfriend had one of their waffle sandwiches. I think the only thing slightly disappointing was the coffee. I got a pumpkin spice drink, and the espresso/coffee they made it with tasted burnt and old.

I'd probably return here, but not for the coffee."}
{"text":"Gluten free waffles were delicious! Next time I think I'll get it well done for a bit crispier bite. The West Coast waffle sandwich was super tasty as well. Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like the smell of fresh waffles and coffee in Tiabi!!!
As soon as I walked in I was engulfed by the smell of butter, sugar, and the smell hot irons. I thought I walking through heaven, this is intense.  

These guys have a great list of waffles ranging from sweet to savory.
My favorite sweet waffle is the Vivas Las Elvis
Bananas, peanut butter, chopped bacon and honey on a Belgian waffle. Vegan version-sub bacon and honey for almonds and agave.

I believe the place stands out for the Wafflewiches.  
The West Coast wafflewich is chicken, tomato, avocado and bacon in between a toasted waffle.
The lightly crunch with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon combination is over the top.
Definitely something you must try!

On top of that they make fabulous coffee too, complements the food.
They carry all types of coffee you would expect with few specialties the one I'm eager to try is Tiff's Waffle Machiato; Cinnamon vanilla latte, whipped cream and caramel sauce and served with a churronimo waffle on top. 

The customer service there outstanding!! 
Mae is a delightful person and shes cool to have conversation with. I was fortunate to have similar food interests with her as far as finding new things in town to eat. 

I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Waffle me, please. 

Once your senses are completely overwhelmed from casino dwelling on the LV Strip, head over to Tiabi for something a bit more down to Earth: smoothies, coffee and waffles. 

It sounds a lot more decadent than it really is: an honest to goodness cafe. No gimmick, no half naked servers, no gaudy decor or slots. Plain and simple good eats, drinks, wifi and everyday people.

Tiabi opens early, around 6:30 am on weekdays. Which is good because I arrived around 7:45, parched and hungry. Strawberry banana smoothie took the edge off for a few hours, then the West Coast waffle sando took care of the rest. 

A few hours of normal does a body good. I headed back to my hotel feeling recharged and ready to take on the Strip again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee shop in Vegas! Coffee is amazing every time!! You have to try the Tiffs waffle macchiato and the Red Bull cider, they have an amazing waffle bar with the freshest Ingredients. Their expresso beans are roasted locally in Nevada and are 1000000 times better than Starbucks! I only wish this place had more locations"}
{"text":"First time here & I loved it!! The girl at the register was super sweet and informative . She recommended couple items ( we ended up getting them picture shown) . Prices are reasonable plus we got a 10% for checking in !! Food tastes great you can taste the flavors from fresh strawberries whip and all that !! If I lived in Vegas I would definitely be here all the time !! Definitely recommend !! :)"}
{"text":"I had the red velvet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. One of the best waffles I've ever had.

They had a bunch of really unique weird ones. Like bacon with bananas which you don't think would work but it actually does.

Anyways, highly recommend if you're in the mood for something sweet."}
{"text":"Tiabi is located in the heart of Las Vegas on Maryland and flamingo in the target shopping mall. I like to support independent coffee shops, Tiabi is unique, and they have a variety of coffee flavors and a very large variety of waffles. I ordered the Churro-mon in which was a waffle with cinnamon sugar, I asked for the non-vegan waffle and whip cream on the top. I also ordered the lavender latte hot with almond milk. I had an enjoyable experience the waffle and the coffee were good. The place is clean and the staff is warm and friendly. My only issue was the location. I went early Sunday Morning around 830. There are some homeless men in the area but this part of Vegas has not gone through the revitalization that Freemont East has enjoyed yet, I do like the fact that Tiabi is located there, the area needs businesses like Tiabi to revitalize the area. I would like to support this local business, but I won't return. I was very uncomfortable with the homeless men in front of the shop. There was even a homeless man inside trying to make a purchase with change, he didn't have enough money and went back and forth with the cashier half the time I was there. I wanted to make sure I left the restaurant before Him so that I could get to my car. While He was talking to the cashier I quickly grabbed my purse and went to the door to leave, the homeless man was right behind me. Luckily He went the opposite way from where I was going. I was a little scared by this. I went to my car and locked my door. I noticed the homeless man that I saw inside was near the shop yelling and cursing at an invisible person. Also noticed that there was another homeless man in sitting in the parking lot singing very loudly to himself. Unfortunately I won't be back unless I go with a group. The neighborhood is too sketchy."}
{"text":"Leslie Knope is my spirit animal and one of the traits we share is our love for waffles. As a vegetarian who dabbles in veganism, Tiabi's wide array of sweet, breakfast waffles satisfies my sweet tooth and my dietary needs. Thank you ladies for opening your shop and making Vegas a little sweeter :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! There was a quite a wait before receiving our food but they warned us. It's a good think we shared because we ordered a sandwich and a waffle and they came out separately. Both were good. It's nice see them making everything fresh in front of us."}
{"text":"Went to this place during a birthday weekend after I bought a Livingsocial deal, pretty awesome little spot! 

Exceptional customer service, great food, and cool atmosphere. I love small businesses like these, especially in a place like Las Vegas, they are diamonds in the rough!

Trust me, we went to some pretty bad spots using Livingsocial/Groupon deals before here.

John, our cashier was very polite and friendly, and the food was pretty unique. Definitely recommend hitting up this little gem next time you're in Vegas and don't want that tourist Vegas service. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the coffee.

Got one of the smaller stuffed waffles from the front case- It was pretty and cute but I didn't really like the taste- kind of mushy on the inside. But I will prob. try something different next time. Super friendly owner and I love the idea. I will most differently be back for the fairly priced delicious coffee and espresso!"}
{"text":"I found this place Yelp and with a shining review from my fellow Elite-er I decided to give it a try. I kept it simple...large coffee and a coconut orange muffin. DELICIOUS muffin and a great cup of coffee. Small spot with counter service and easy parking. I'll be back for more !"}
{"text":"Excellent staff, very friendly and eager to make sure the customer is satisfied. I'm impressed. I had the bacon maple waffle, it was very tasty. This is very much a cafe, so the portions are smaller, if you're hungry order a couple servings."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and a yummy selection of waffles! There are so many toppings to choose from! Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you're looking for amazing breakfast and lunch this is the place to be! Very trendy and the environment is fun! We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It seems to be so rare at times, but they've got it here. Perfect customer service. Friendly, cheerful, helpful, inviting. Felt like I'd known them for years or were neighbors. Food was great too. Need more tables, but place was clean. Music cheerful and modern indie. They thanked everyone too as they left. This was our last stop on our visit to Vegas this trip. I'll be back in a week and likely swing by for breakfast again. I got the golden waffles."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my Twilight Lavender Latte,  hubby was ok with his Pistachio Latte, but he's used to heavy sweet flavoring from Starbucks.  I thought it was nice and smooth with enough flavor, not overpowering art all.   Waffles were nice,  not heavy,  well cooked.  Just a little on the small side for seating,  but it worked out. Pleasant employees and a groupon helped!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of TIABI's other location on Maryland. 

I've recently moved closer to this side of town, and while I was out with my mom on Sunday, I decided to pop in for a coffee.

This location is much smaller than the other, but its cozy and clean. 
Service was great.  The guy who took my order was very nice, and service was quick!

Loved the Twilight Lavender coffee iced!  So delicious.  

I will definitely be coming back soon to have some waffles!"}
{"text":"Oh Tiabi. 

\"To Inspire and Be Inspired.\"  My visit yesterday was definitely inspirational.

I came out here last month for the Yelp Coffee Cruise event, and have been trying to make it back since.  Yesterday, I was in the area for a birthday party a little early, so I popped in for coffee and a waffle.  

Tiabi is an adorable little coffee shop, hidden away in the strip mall near Target on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway.  Before the Coffee Cruise, I had no idea it existed, even though I frequent that area all the time. 

Yesterday, when I stopped in,  I took a look at their drink and waffle menu, and decided on the Twilight Lavender Latte, and the Golden Waffle. 

Service was super friendly.  The cashier was polite, and the girl who made my waffle had an infectious smile.  Tiffany, the owner, remembered me from the Cruise, and said hello after I had been seated.  We chatted for a minute, and then my waffle was ready.

So...the coffee.  
Light.  Flavorful.  Aromatic.   Delicious.  I may have done myself a disservice in ordering the Twilight Lavender Latte on my first time back, because I may not ever want to order another drink as long as this is available.  It is SO good...I shared a sip with a friend when I arrived at the birthday party, and her whole face lit up, it is THAT delicious.  Home Run, Tiabi.  Home Run. 

The waffle.  Oh, the waffle. 
The Golden Waffle is simple.  Its a light, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, golden, perfect waffle.  Its dusted with powdered sugar, and served with butter on the side.  There was syrup on the table, but I didn't need any, and I normally drown my waffles in syrup.  

Sweet.  Delicate.  Awesome.  

Tiabi, I'm so glad I had the time to pop by yesterday.  You've excelled at making me feel welcome, and the quality of your offerings is truly inspiring."}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious here! Perfect spot for a brunch break! Super small and cute but very organized and clean! Great customer service! They messed up on my order one time and gave me a free wafflewich for the inconvenience! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"My first time trying a pistachio latté which did not disappoint. Tiabi is a nice cafe with great food options. The interior could use a little sprucing up as I wouldn't want to spend my day here to work/study, but if you're in the area and looking for good coffee and food this is a great option."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! The nice man there gave me 20% off because of an order Grubhub had to cancel, which wasn't even his fault so he didn't have to discount my order but he still went above and beyond to do it. That's first. Second! THE FOOD THERE WAS AMAZING!! Me and my friend ordered the west coast waffle sandwich (amazing) and also the pistachio latte (super amazing). I highly recommend this place for amazing service and amazing food altogether. You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Everything we had was absolutely amazing. We ordered a couple of different waffles and sandwiches and none of us could decide on a favorite. They were all so good! The lattes were also delicious and the staff was so kind and helpful. We'll definitely come back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a really great place if you are looking for something unique. Its on the smaller side, but its very welcoming. The prices are fair and the coffee and waffles are great! I will deffinetly be returning."}
{"text":"I've always come here for drinks. First time I tried food there was yesterday and had that West Coast Wafflewich. Amazing! Not too heavy for all those flavors and that Tiabi sauce was out of this world! Had a Sirena Tea to go with the wafflewich, very refreshing. A must-return-to-restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"Was in town for a concert with friends and wanted to eat breakfast/brunch somewhere not on the strip as we normally do and try someplace new. We found this place on Groupon, turn out our Groupon couldn't be used but still decided to try it. Walked in, staff was very friendly, spacious place, good music playing, cool art on the walls. Lots of different waffles to try! If you love waffles you'll love this place. I got the \"Golden Waffle\" with a side of fresh fruit and my friends both ordered the \"West Coast\" Waffle Sandwich. Everyone loved their food, the waffles are made to order. Will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Tiabi's new Aliante location isn't quite up to speed compared to the Maryland location. The small eatery lacks the quirk and style of the second older location, and is bare and white. Hopefully within the coming weeks the new Tiabi will spruce itself up. 

VIVA LAS ELVIS ($6.99): I got the vegan version with coconut bacon and agave. The waffle was a bit overcooked and the peanut butter was also dry. The sliced bananas were the best part. :/ 2/5

WAFFLEDILLA ($5.59): This chicken-waffle sandwich looked pretty plain. Avocado is $0.75 cents extra, but we're not fans of avocado. I think lettuce and tomato could have made the waffledilla more interesting! My husband said it was just okay. 3/5 

COCONUT TRUFFLE ICED COFFEE ($3.50): We ordered a large. This drink was sweet and had a delightful coconut aftertaste. 4/5 

AMBIANCE: Oldie music and Sinatra played in the background, which is fine by me! However, out of three tables inside, two of them were dirty. On the plus side, there was a cute self-serve water station available. Napkins and silverware are also self-serve.

Worth a Return Visit?
We probably won't be rushing back anytime soon, but will give it another whirl once Tiabi works all the kinks out.

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #16"}
{"text":"Items ordered:
\"Snickers\" Iced Coffee
Lollies - Red Velvet, Nutella & Almonds
Kisses - Sliced strawberries, chocolate drizzle and whipped cream, served Belgian style
Viva Las Elvis - Bananas, peanut butter, chopped bacon and honey
Honey I'm Home - Vegan Churronimo waffle tossed in cinnamon and sugar topped with vanilla ice cream and honey

Tucked away in a small strip mall off Maryland Parkway and dotted with cute décor plus paintings from local artists it was alongside two friends that I sat down for a midday snack at Tiabi Coffee & Waffles and as much as I really wanted to like the kitschy little spot and their menu of made-to-order takes on the European classic our experience could best be described as mixed, an effect of dogmatic rules regarding the use of discounts and coupons alongside batters that proved utterly unremarkable, the toppings alone serving to save the day in the case of standard and $1-upcharged \"Belgian\" options, both.  Apparently named as an acronym of the underlying motto \"to inspire and be inspired\" with free WiFi and an innovative drink list including a rich caramel and cocoa infused iced coffee for myself plus a heavily praised honey cream iced latte for my friend it was after only a few moments of indecision that our order was placed and chatting while we waited the tasting soon began with a duo of $2.50 \"lollies,\" the single strips of spongy dough pressed between hot metal proving paltry in portion and largely flavorless save for the sweet finishing drizzle that unfortunately warned of things to come.  Entirely eschewing savories in favor of items far more sweet it was after perhaps a twenty minute wait that our proper order arrived and beginning first with a doughy Belgian topped with fresh berries beneath artificial tasting chocolate I quickly turned my attention to the alternatives, the Elvis faring a bit better by balancing sweet and savory over a slightly more study base while the \"Honey I'm Home\" proved the best of bunch in its sugar-crisp coating overlying a somewhat dense crumb - its \"veganism\" thoroughly compromised by honey and ice cream but the result all the better for it."}
{"text":"This place had me at muffin tops. No, not that kind when jeans are a bit snug;)
Friendly staff, always important!  The staff makes sure that one is satisfied  with your drink order. If not- they will correct that for you:)
Tasty treats, and oh yes tasty caffeine drinks!
Fours stars, it's not close and def out of my way or I would be here more often than not. 
My latest visit I ventured out of my espresso shot habit and ordered a pistachio latte:
Half the sweetness 
Non fat milk
End result: pistachio delight!
I've been here probably a total of ten times, always with a tasty caffeine pick me up."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a Sunday breakfast/brunch. We ordered the Red Velvet waffle, Bananatella, Pistachio latte and the Guru Burger. Added some fresh fruit on the waffle for a dollar more.All of them were just so good! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Tiabi Waffles was really good. Worthy the drive. Hidden on the side of a strip mall with a a Target. I had the Banana Nutella waffle as. Late afternoon snack along with a Coconut Truffle Iced Coffee. Bother we're very nice. The coffee was very sweet. The waffle was just right. Sliced bananas whipped cream and Nutella. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Wait time was way more than expected, 38 minutes for a waffle is insane. When my partner and I finally got our waffles, they were cold and hard.  

My partner requested no whip cream due to her being lactose intolerant. Watching you guys scrape the whip cream off is lazy and unprofessional. There's still traces of whip cream on there...

Customer service wasn't very friendly. We found Tiabi through Yelp based on their reviews and the overall experience was NOT up to par. It was very disappointing. 

Environment was overwhelming crowded. The layout is a bit compact and not ideal for a large group of people. We had to sit at a dirty table until 2 mins before we received our food. It was disgusting. 

Our drinks (teas) were also not given to us until 2 mins before our food arrived. Water wasn't even offered. 

Don't get me wrong, we weren't expecting Ritz Carlton service BUT the basics of dining at a cafe. We might try it again when it's less busy, but I would give our overall experience 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Vegas and is in dire need for caffeine, opt for Tiabi instead, their handcrafted coffees are sooo good. My favorite is their Pistachio iced latte. (sad that I don't know where to get the exact blend in CA) The waffles and sandwich waffles are pretty dang tasty too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was so so good. Got the pecan candied vegan waffle just for kicks (not vegan) and coffee with almond milk and vanilla. So fantastic. Can't wait to try this place again. They seemed to have a fantastic variety of fresh juices too."}
{"text":"I got the West Coast, and it tastes awesome! Couple it with syrup and it tastes amazing! My wife got the Banatella with strawberries instead of bananas and a side of vanilla ice cream and milk. Overall, I'm from Cali but I'm hitting up this place every time I come! Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had a groupon which landed me here on a Sunday morning, well morning for me, which was 1 PM. The place was slammed and the four employees behind the counter were busy making fresh smoothies, espresso, waffles, and the like.

My iced honey latte was perfection. Fresh espresso, cream, and a touch of honey. It wasn't overly sweet and it still tasted like coffee. Really enjoyed it. It was just too small. I had to order another.

I got the Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich. Really nothing too special about it. Fresh made waffle, egg, cheese, and sausage. Wasn't awful, wasn't knock my socks off. It was offered with either a side of fruit or house made chips for $1, I opted with the fruit (because this was a total fat kid breakfast).

As I stated previously, the place was slammed. My friend and I snagged a table after a group of four left. We stacked up the dishes and ate at the \"dirty\" table because we are savages and needed the immune system boost.  We sat at that dirty table and the place had died down, not once did the 4 people behind the counter begin to clean the place up or even clear our dishes. 

Decent spot, coffee was the bombDOTcom, food was meh. Definitely would go back for the coffee, but I'd skip the food."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but their vegan waffles are so good! And there coffees are creative and delicious. I love going back there!"}
{"text":"pistachio Iced Coffee is better than #sex this place has so many creative options from down right satisfying to vegan options. I'm in love   Banana Nutella Waffle"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!!

It's surprising how much this place has grown on me. It's really not a bad place coffee, small bites, etc. nearby UNLV. I've tried multiple items and have been satisfied each time - never have I felt I wasted my money. 

Hot White Mango Tea - I was having a huge headache and getting this hot tea definitely made me feel better. I'm not usually a flavored hot tea person but this will be my togo when I'm craving a hot and healthier beverage.

Iced Caramel Macchiato - The coffee taste here is suuuper heavy - not too much of my thing, will skip this for the future.

Tropical Siena and Just Peachy Tea - they are separate teas and I've tried them both. The taste for both were a bit subtle, can live without it in the future.

Red Velvet Frappe - holy crap is it good here or what. Per me since I don't like too much chocolate, I've asked them to lessen the Cocoa and oh my, it is delish. Per bun it's probably the best we've found out here so far.

Waffle Sandwiches:

The Waffle Dilla - add the avocado. You'll thank me later.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Um the frankestien coffee has five shots of expresso and it made me tired...  It's over priced coffee and I've tried a few flavors for 5$ really isn't worth going there.  It's good to try it once and try a unique coffee.  Waffles are weird"}
{"text":"Great savory waffles. A little stingy on the fruits with the paceman. Delicious place overall"}
{"text":"We tried the ice coffee, peach tea, Viva las Elvis waffle and the Breakfast Waffle Sandwich with Turkey sausage instead of bacon. 
Overall the coffee was better than McDonald's, 7eleven, dunkin iced coffee but I didn't enjoy it more than Starbucks. The price was also a bit higher. This is just my personal taste preference but my opinion nonetheless. 
The breakfast sandwich was alright but didn't come with any sides like salsa. Also the Viva Elvis didn't have butter but was acceptable with the toppings. The tea was freshly brewed and I admire that. 
Overall I would not give this place a second go anytime soon as what they offered wasn't out of this world or a game changer. I have had far better homemade waffles and coffee in my time and seeing this is the bread and butter of the business it should exceed all others and then only add to the greatness with other optional dishes. The place could use a bit more outdoor seating, however the place is in not in the largest area for seating options."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super chill coffee shop with the best vegan food around. Their special coffee drinks are all worth trying but I recommend the lavender latte. It has a good vibe for doing work in or for a casual date. Definitely stop by this place if you're in the UNLV area."}
{"text":"The Good : We had the waffles with fruit and a bananatella waffle. They were all delicious!! We also had iced coffees which were great as well. The staff is super friendly. 

The Bad: they forgot to make one of our waffles. We had to remind them. 

The Ugly: the restroom was a bit dirty and we went right when they opened. 

But, yes , I recommend this place. Flaws were minor."}
{"text":"When I came to Vegas on vacation, this was my last breakfast stop before headed back to NYC and I wish I could have taken it with me! :( I miss this so much, I crave their mixed coffee drinks! They've inspired me to try out recipes and maybe open up a food truck. HA love it though and can't wait to come back to Vegas and make this my go to breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and good waffles.  Impressed with thr vegan waffle.  Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Order the kisses with bacon. Its the best thing you will every place in your mouth. Think strawberry and bacon infused waffle with whipped cream and nutella to top it off. It is fabulous and they make it super cutsie. Staff here is awesome, they really know what they are doing and have a knowledge of what people like."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My favorite restaurant hands down! Vegan options, fair price, and delicious fresh food. It usually feels like they don't really have quite enough people on staff, but I don't think the wait is ever unreasonable. Most employees are friendly and listen well. They give student discounts and have cool lil events every once in a while. They have also a Leslie Knoppe quote on the wall, so they clearly have it together. Definitely give this place a try. True Vegas gem"}
{"text":"Yummy! We decided to find something to eat for breakfast of of the Vegas strip and thanks to Yelp found this great cafe! Great waffles and great coffee! Oh and the people working there are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"The Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich was pretty amazing. I didn't quite enjoy the cold brew as much as I wanted, it was a bit too bold and not very smooth. Prices were good since I had a student discount. Would definitely stop by again for the breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Dropped in for coffee and glad I did.  Ordered a caramel macchiato, which was amazing!  I was also very impressed with the quality of customer service.  I look forward to returning here soon."}
{"text":"Very yummy! The vegan waffle is so light and has a great flavor(: I think I had the vegan waffle with the cheese if that's what it's called haha? Don't remember it was really good!"}
{"text":"It's super cute inside with magazines, games, and good music and the staff was super sweet and helpful. The coffee was sweet but good (got the cupcake latte and the iced dirty mocha chai... The second was too chocolately to be a real chai honestly)
But for a healthy place, they had no egg whites! Which to me is silly. 
We ordered the white macadamia waffle nut which was good but they put the toppings on top, not inside the batter which would've made it better. The toasty Tokyo was good along with the waffle club.  
The groupon and punch cards are a nice touch. Giving it four stars because it's great that a place like this is by UNLV where there are no breakfast places or healthy places."}
{"text":"If you like candy and everything sweet, then this is a good place for you. Their churro waffles are good, but the coffee-and I've tried multiple different ones-all taste like Bonnie Bell lip balm. They're also insanely overpriced for what they are."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews and the one $. Definitely lived up to our expectations!!!! While we were staring at the menu the cashier asked us if we wanted help with ordering (LOVE be asked as opposed to someone just jumping in!!) he asked what my taste preferences were and offered examples, sweet, savory, etc. he then made suggestions based on our answers. We took his suggestions and we were very pleased! He was totally on point!! I also had the coffee of the day, Guatemalan. Smooth and robust! Not bitter like another coffee place we all know and love ;) ! I cannot wait to come back try a few other items! I definitely want to try their Kale smoothie next, sounds divine!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfst!! Waffledilla and west coast are bombs.  Will be coming back for more in this place"}
{"text":"This is probably the best coffee and waffle place in Las Vegas. The best thing about this place is they have lot of basic stuff that you can expect at a waffle shop but then their own creations AKA Wafflewiches kills it. Their espressos and lattes are nice. More of the darkers side. Being a vegetarian, I tried the Guru burger. It was good size and I was set for the day. Try it with their special TIABI sauce."}
{"text":"So cute and so yummy! Always have gotten the West Coast sandwich and check in for a free lolli"}
{"text":"Amazing waffles and coffee. Service is great.  Staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is awesome.  We are in town for a few days and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Coffee and waffles? YES PLEASE!

Came across this great spot on the Yelp app - on the hunt for something sweet. We skipped the coffee, but sure got our sweet tooth craving fulfilled with one of their delicious waffles.

They have various waffles to choose from with toppings such as nutella, banana, strawberries, chocolate and other sweets. Then they also have savory waffle sandwiches with bacon, turkey - and even egg and cheese!

We stuck with the Banana Tella which has banana, nutella drizzle, almonds and whipped cream. You can make any waffle a \"dessert\" by adding a scoop of ice cream. YES PLEASE! The waffle was incredible. I would of liked more of a \"home made\" whip cream - this one was possibly from the can - but it was still great.

We got the chance to chat up the owner and she was so nice! We asked her about the concept and apparently it started as a coffee shop - then they wanted to add some desserts and decided waffles would be a good fit - then decided to hit the lunch crowd so they added the savory waffles. Genius!

Awesomee concept - great folks working there - and a delicious product! Wish I had tried the coffee! Aw, well - gives me reason to come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Probably the best waffle ever. Perfect amount of crispiness. The butter was just enough and light. The guys that run this place already have the reviews to match the restaurant. The mix of healthy options to compliment the waffle are a bonus. The service was top notch. Super friendly and customer service oriented."}
{"text":"This place was pretty packed for a Saturday morning.  The prices are really good for the large waffle breakfast sandwiches, probably just a little more than what you would pay at a fast food joint.  I really enjoyed my chicken BLT waffle sandwich, the waffle just had a slight crunch on the outside but was still soft on the inside.  They have a special sauce...that didn't quite come through, it could have used a little more sauce to balance the sandwich out.  Overall, cute atmosphere with a lot of good breakfast options and drink options.  The service was a little slow since they were so busy.  I think it took them almost 10 minutes before they took our order =(, but I would still go back for a lazy Saturday breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Super cute shop, great menu variety, decent food, but SLOW AF. 

Came here for what we thought was a fast breakfast option. Just to take our orders took a while. Ok, whatever. Got coffee orders quick, a good sign. Then we proceeded to wait like 45 minutes for our food to come out. How long does it take to toast a damn waffle and put some toppings or sandwich meat and eggs in the middle? 

The service is friendly. The atmosphere for the restaurant is nice. It's laid-back and relaxed. Clean bathrooms are a plus. But perhaps the laid-backness is what caused the slow food. 

We got the Green Nut (?) the super green smoothie, the breakfast sandwich plus sausage and bacon, and the western sandwich. The green smoothie tasted like what you'd expect of a green smoothie, I wouldn't really want to get it again cuz it wasn't much of a wow. The breakfast sandwich was tasty. Not too flavorful but I didn't mind it. The western was delicious and the highlight. The waffle was perfect. 

3 stars because it doesn't deserve lower. But I don't think I'd come back based on how long it takes to get a WAFFLE."}
{"text":"We had The West Coast and 2 Hot Chocolates and Maple Baci  Waffle.    Everything was absolutely delicious we will definetly be back... I wish they had a patio to smell some fresh air and open later like midnight.  The staff was cool!!!"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of this place! Quality ingredients that you can taste for a fair price! Everyone that works here is super friendly and upbeat. Try the West Coast sandwich as soon as humanly possible!"}
{"text":"What a spectacular find! The lady working was so friendly and helpful. There are different waffle sandwiches you can get or you can do a build your own waffle with custom toppings. I got the classic golden waffle but I want to go back to try the churro waffle! They also have a pretty expansive drinks menu that range from creamy espresso drinks to light teas with basil! The prices are pretty good, for two customized waffles and a coffee was about $16. This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!   We had the Vegan Waffle with coconut vegan bacon and Strawberries.  It was perfect."}
{"text":"My friend's backyard is this strip of businesses. I don't even know why he drove? Lol. We were way due for this so-called monthly promise of getting together no matter what. Life happens. I got children...he has none. So really it's me who has been slacking. Now that I'm done with confessionals...

I show about 936am. There was only another couple who were ready to be done. It is not big in there. Just a few tables inside and one outside. Or two? Dang, forgot. Since we agreed to this spot the night prior...I had all ready scoped the menu online. I opted for the vegan wafflewich--which has tomatoes, spring mix, avocado, and their Tiabi sauce for $5.50. Call me boring, but hey...that's what I wanted! The waffle itself was cooked very accordingly for what it was holding inside it. I wondered if it'd be too crispy/overcooked would the tomatoes and avocado along with their sauce sog the waffle..but no it didn't! I mean, I had it sitting there while chitchatting so it definitely help up. I completely forgot to ask if the waffle is literally vegan, because if not...they should change the name of that sandwich. I don't exactly know what the TIABI sauce consists of...I thought it was rather light and peppery, but it blended well with the vegetables in my sandwich. The vegetables were very fresh and crispy. Love that. If you don't have a sweet tooth or feel like consuming anything with meat, I think this is a great meal choice.

I also ordered their honey creme latte as an iced drink. Honestly, I don't know shit about coffee and lattes. Lol.  I just thought adding such a drink to my morning breakfast with the homeboy felt like I was completing the tone. So if you're like me, it tasted like a light iced coffee that's been creamed out. Coffee lovers don't frown! Lol. HOWEVER, I thought it was pretty good. It even sat for a few hours after I left Tiabi (yes, I didn't finish it) and I was seriously amazed it didn't taste watered down. It definitely got my day going without feeling whacked out. I would order it again.

So my friend is on a diet...he had a smoothie! I can't even begin to tell you how sideways I looked at him. Make it a cheat morning and get the Viva Las Elvis you retard!! Says the person who ordered a vegan wafflewich. He thoroughly enjoyed his banana peanut butter smoothie .

There were two people working that morning and they were certainly friendly and humorous. I did think my wafflewich took just a tad long than I'd imagine it taking considering what i was ordering. I kind of excused it because the other worker had just started. Training mode i assume. There were only two things that got me curious that morning...1)I wasn't sure where the hell to put our trash and the workers were in the back for a bit to even ask 2) I see a case for vegan pastries but twas empty? Boo. Not that serious, though. Those 2 things are stuck in my memory bank from that morning. Oh! so we just left my plate on the table. I'm assuming that's the drill.

As we exited a couple mothers with their jogging strollers and one of their dogs rolled in. Dog outside, obviously. Other than that, it was fairly quiet and the place wasn't dirty. If you love waffles, then I highly recommend it! Definitely kid friendly, but I'd skip bringing the stroller(s) in.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great little place. My Belgian style bacon waffle was perfect! Plenty of parking, fast WiFi, & super-friendly folks."}
{"text":"We chose to eat here at tiabi before our first day at Edc, with my husband and I from Sacramento and a bunch of our friends from Los Angeles, we were really excited to try out this really cute waffle shop. Seeing the pictures and menu on Yelp, I already super intrigued by the banana and Nutella waffle. 
With a big group entering the shop, we were sort of aware that maybe we would have to split up our group to sit down and eat. 
It was self serve, so we each ordered our meal, standing around at first trying to find a spot to sit. Eventually we found a table big enough for us if we all squished together. 
The food sort of took a little while to get to our table, but we did get our drinks first. 
I ordered the Serena tea (or something like that I don't remember), but it was super refreshing. Especially against that Las Vegas heat. Some of our friends had also ordered several other drinks, and they loved theirs as well. 
When our food finally came, we got the sandwiches first. Most of my friends had ordered the west coast sandwich, and they were super pleased with it. Another one of my friend ordered the Thai chicken and he was really glad with that one as well.
Overall I'd say that tiabi was pretty satisfying for my group of friends. Although small, it does give off a comfortable vibe. Very easy going and relaxed, the customer service was also pretty great."}
{"text":"Really awesome breakfast experience. 
From now on, our first breakfast option in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. I ordered the West Coast waffle sandwich and it was delicious! I also tried their snickers iced coffee and in my opinion it tastes just like a snickers bar. I will return. Recommended."}
{"text":"Loved this little coffee shop in the middle of a not so great area. Was looking for a caffine lift and found this place nearby where I was. When you walk in it is a very cafe vibe-not so much coffee shop. The decorations are super cool and there is a lot to see inside this small place.

They have a nice variety of waffles both regular and vegan. I think this is a good choice for breakfast and even for vegans and non vegans so they can eat well together. They also have meat waffles such as bacon, fruit waffles and tons of other tasty choices. 

 They have a hot lavender Infused latte which I loved, and many options for cold coffee as well. If in the area its a great choice for a nice homemade waffle and a good coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee drinks and great food,  as long as you like waffles.  Freshly made waffles, smell so good.   Tried the pistachio coffee, excellent."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to eat this west coast wafflewiche. Got big reviews that it's the best sandwich. 
Shoutout to Jessica for her awesome customer service and helping me because I've never been here. 
She was a true help, THANKS :-)"}
{"text":"This place had delicious food, tasty coffee and a cool vibe. The people working there were friendly and helpful. It was my first visit and I am glad I found it. It's a local gem and I will be frequenting this place often now! They suggested \"The West Coast\" sandwich for lunch and it was very tasty. I paired it with \"Tiff's Waffle Macchiato\" and a cool glass of ice water. I sat and read my book, ate my lunch and enjoyed the chill atmosphere and my tasty food/beverage. Thanks guys and gals for a great experience."}
{"text":"The coffee and food was delicious! Ambiance and prices are wonderful. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the speed of service, they were just really slow at getting the drinks and food out. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"These vegan waffles have been on my radar for a while and I'm glad I finally got to try it! 

My bf & I came in on a Friday at about 8:30am and we were the only ones in the restaurant at this time so we were served right away. It's cafe type ordering so you just order and pay at the register and seat yourself. 

Since it was our first time, I asked the girl which items were vegan and she told me the only one was \"Viva Las Elvis\" which had coconut bacon, peanut butter and agave syrup on top. I'm not a huge fan of PB but decided to give it a try since she said it was the only vegan option. Little did I know, after I ordered I saw on yelp reviews that they do offer vegan butter to top your waffles which sort of bothered me as to why she didn't give me the heads up on that since I could've technically ordered another \"non vegan\" waffle and just customized it to be vegan. I mean I did like my waffle but it wasn't the greatest and wished I had opted for the butter pecan waffles instead but maybe next time. 

My bf absolutely loved the Guru Burger and couldn't be more satisfied! We liked the fact that the patty isn't made of soy and is made of superfood ingredients that make the burger so much more enjoyable. We also got a free \"snickers\" iced coffee with check in which was also pretty good. 

Overall, we had a good first time experience. The staff was friendly, I love how big the cafe is and it's a perfect place to study for students especially since it's right by UNLV!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and was not let down. Simon greeted us and helped me out with what to order. Very friendly and knowledgable. Great food and we couldn't believe the awesome prices. I had a breakfast waffle sandwich, and my fiancé had a Nutella waffle with banana. Not to mention we both had specialty coffee drinks and the whole bill came out to practically $20. We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This small, locally owned eatery is close to UNLV.  It is in the Target shopping center and is difficult to find the first time.  But it's worth it!  The food is spectacular! 
The waffles are crispy and chewy, the coffee is delicious, and the ambience is fun and quirky.   It is apparent that customer service is very important, as all customers are treated well.  Both the savory and sweet waffles are fantastic!  It should be a must go for every Las Vegan!"}
{"text":"Great place. me and my lady tried it. food was delicious. service was very good. the woman was very thoughtful and took care of us. forgot to leave a tip though. felt bad about it. looking forward to returning even though its far from my house."}
{"text":"Really, really slow. I know this isn't McDonalds, but 30 min. to get half our order and another 20 to get the rest? This was 9:30 am and there were only 6 other people in there the entire 1:15 hours we were there. Really cute place, small portions at great prices; but it just doesn't matter when they are so slow. Seriously, the woman behind the counter was even moving slow, no sense that people might be coming to her food establishment because they are hungry. And - the reason for 1 star- I could see her work because I was facing the counter, she was handling all the food with her bare hands. Picking up waffles, slicing strawberries, AND taking cash, answering the business phone, texting on her cell phone, never putting on gloves to handle food AND never washed her hands. Disgusting, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Still love you Tiabi but I've been coming here for a long time and the restaurant just looks dirty and things look worn out and yeah... still love you though  food 10/10"}
{"text":"Don't usually go out for breakfast. I had a friend in town and she didn't want McDonald's . I had the west coast and an iced snickers . Will get again. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here first time. Foods are okay. It just took so long to get our two orders. Waited abt.20 min. Long long waiting while not many customers and its Monday late morning. 

I received the reply from the owner to my review bi think we have to try the place one more time. Hope it will be good next time.  

Since the restaurant left me msg, we will try one more time when we go to LV next time. At least they care of review. That is good to know."}
{"text":"I don't know why I've waited this long to write a review but I should have a long time ago. I LOVE THIS PLACE. The coffee is great, the waffles are delicious, and the place is spacious and great for working or studying. Music isn't too loud and the service is great. 

If you get a chance stop by this place and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place serves good coffee in different fun ways! Oh and the waffles are are delicious as well! No too sweet, savory options as well!"}
{"text":"First introduced to TIABI Coffee at their first location on Maryland Pkwy for a Yelp Coffee Cruise event, I was happy to learn that they would eventually open a second location in our neighborhood.  I told co-owner Tiffany S. at that time that I couldn't wait and sure enough, we frequent TIABI quite often since they opened.  My usual order is the Honey Cream latte with almond milk, but the other drinks that I also like are the Twilight Lavender Latte and the Pistachio Latte.  Waffles are a specialty here as their name says.  Try the Red Velvet or the Bananatella for a sweet treat.  
There are still several other items I have yet to try, but since this is TIABI is so close, I'll get around to them sooner or later.  A great addition to our neighborhood and an excellent coffee stop for the locals."}
{"text":"New find thanks to a friend that posted on ig.  I had the breakfast wafflewich.  I added a side of bananas with churro dust with chocolate drizzle.  Had my regular iced coffee with 3 shots.  The music was upbeat and the vibe is super chill.  I will be back I will be back to try a build your own waffle :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, amazing waffles and the coffee was epic.  Try \"Tiff's Special\"!  It is a cinnamon latte topped with a churro style waffle.  Amazing!  Can I move the restaurant to the East Coast?!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. I don't know if I would go back. I didn't find the food to be very tasteful, it was pretty bland. It was also kinda pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Went here from the Strip on my vacation with the Groupon deal and enjoyed it!  Had the Waffle Breakfast sandwich and it was pretty good, could have used more sausage though.  The owners/cooks/cashiers were very friendly and helpful and really made us feel welcome on our visit.  They explained the whole menu and asked where we were from and were very helpful in deciding what we should have.  You should check it out!"}
{"text":"Is there anyone here willing to argue that waffles aren't delicious? That's right, I rest my case. 


Anyway, this place was not exactly what I expected when I read the Yelp reviews... I was picturing a cute little café with table service. What I got was essentially a coffee shop that happened to have waffles in a strip mall. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it just was completely unexpected. I was planning on getting a waffle and egg sandwich, until I found out that they use those weird egg patty things (they don't, you know, cook an egg), so that was out. Ended up getting the Elvis, waffle with peanut butter, bacon, and banana.... of course this was good, how could that be bad?!?! I also had their specialty latte with the cinnamon that comes with a triangle of the cinnamon vegan waffle (got the latte sans vanilla syrup, you know, being healthy and all... lol).... oh ya, super tasty. Definitely a dessert. The waffle was crisp and delicious, the latte was sweet and dessert -y. The breakfast was cheap and satisfying. I would return!"}
{"text":"First time here, greeted with good music, a \"hi ! Welcome in! and a simple but clean menu. Mainly focusing on waffles (Awesome) they offer their own twists to iconic breakfast food including a churro style or red velvet waffle, make it a viva las Elvis and you got one wild treat. They have daily lunch specials for around $6. so i ordered the signature tiffs waffle macchiato (its topped with a CHURRO WAFFLE!)  And a waffledilla ( yes a quesadilla but with a waffle! With chicken and bacon in it! What!) 

Overall:    sollliiddd"}
{"text":"Omg. Hidden gem. I had the bananella waffle replacing the almonds with candied pecans because i didnt want almonds. This was amazing. I chose to eat the sweet waffles and it truely did not disappoint. I had a side of turkey sausage patties. I really didnt care about those. It was dry. I should have gotten bacon. Cant go wrong with a side of bacon. We had the Just peachy green tea. That was pretty good too. Nice and refreshing. My sister got the West Coast. The tiabi sauce is to die for. I would come back for that sauce. If you want savory, get the west coast. Overall great place to have breakfast. I would come back. I would have given 5 stars. I subtracted a star for the turkey sausage. My only disappoint. Dudes that work there was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: naturally well lit, café style layout with open counter and free WiFi.

Beverage: pistachio latte with no expresso. Very tasty and addictive. Dipped my strawberries in it and was great.

Food: chicken berry salad with waffles. Super fresh and abundantly flavorful. Waffles make a neat crouton like crunch. Waffles are light and crispy crunchy with light soft inside. 

Waffle breakfast sandwich was delicious. The cheese was great.

Service: very friendly and bubbly like. Offered more dressing and asked if we needed any else a few times. No gossiping behind counter unlike most casino cafes. They seemed all very happy, adding to the light atmosphere. 

Clean restrooms

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing, the iced coconut truffle is my favorite! 

The breakfast sandwich is what let me down. Plain dry waffle, with 3 strips of bacon, small slab of cheese and barely an egg. Not worth $6 in my opinion. I could definitely find any jack in the box and get the same exact thing for HALF the price and drive."}
{"text":"Really amazing service and food. Ordered the guru burger last time I was here and it was one of my favorite vegan burgers ever !"}
{"text":"Great coffee, waffle was outstanding.  A bit of a wait for everything, but worth it!
I ordered the Tiff's waffle Macchiato and a butter pecan waffle.  My son ordered the West Coast and a Rebel Punch.  We both agreed we will be back!"}
{"text":"I like it. My friend got me the hashtag breakfast sandwich and I like it! I can't speak much for their service but my friend said she had to wait a awhile for the food and her waffle was too crispy and overdone. However I will come back to try their coffee and other tings"}
{"text":"Came in with my family of 4 (including two kids)...ordered Tiabi Red Velvet, Hashtag, two Hash Tag Sandwhiches and two mocha latee's...food was pretty good...coffee was sweet...ambiance was cute...seating was lacking...staff is nice...service was super slow...50 minutes to get 1/2 our order out!!!  Over an hour to get second half of order!!!  It's a fairly new establishment...hopefully they pick it up...it has a lot of potential.  I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim now I'm dying to go back for more. Waffles with Nutella and banana are my fave and the coffee was good too."}
{"text":"I decided to come here on a Friday at 1 p.m. while visiting Las Vegas. The pictures on Yelp looked absolutely wonderful which made me really want to go.

Parking is free and was easy to find. The store is located in a strip mall with okay ambience, but nothing that I was too impressed with. 

I decided to order Tiff's Waffle Macchiato because the combination of a coffee and waffle seemed amazing. While the churro waffle was tasty, the coffee was super gross and I could not finish it. It made me wish that I had only ordered a waffle and not gone for the coffee.

While the service was friendly, I was not asked whether I wanted my order for here or to-go and their default was to make it to-go. It was only after they tried to hand me the waffle in a paper bag that I corrected them that I would like it for here. That was sort of disappointing and I wish I was asked while ordering instead.

If I come back it will be for the waffles only and to try some of the vegan menu items. I would definitely not recommend getting coffee here."}
{"text":"Wooo! Wow what a treat! Wonderful rich coffee and a warm greeting from the staff! The food and coffee were to die for."}
{"text":"It's a waffle heaven place, the must try things here for me is a west coast waffle that has chicken, bacon and avocado on a classic waffle and for dessert order a Belgian waffle with banana, strawberries and of course some Nutella. You haven't lived until you'll had some!!!"}
{"text":"Tiabi aptly stands for \"To Inspire and Be Inspired\" and I was inspired to stuff my face hole with waffles.  

Visited on Sunday 6-26-16 at 10AM.   $28.34 got us a breakfast waffle sandwich, two drinks, a side of fruit, a cookie, and a variety waffle. This restaurant is located two doors down from Sakana on Flamingo & Maryland behind Target.  

I had the viva las elvis waffle for $6.99 which is a waffle topped with honey, peanut butter, bananas, and chopped bacon.  I was literally in heaven.  It's one of the best things I've ever eaten.  My only complaint would be they serve real maple syrup which I hate...I'd rather have the fake Aunt Jamima stuff clogging up my arteries and killing me slowly.  #DIABEETUS

I also had the Tiff's Waffle Macchiato for $3.95.  I had the iced version and it was wonderful.  I loved the whipped cream topping and the waffle on top was still warm and covered in cinnamon and sugar.  

Service was fast and friendly.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"love the decoration in this place! super rad star wars paintings near bathroom done by Patrizia who I randomly know from bikram yoga! the staff was very friednly and helped my boyfriend and I picked the perfect drink.. we got their khale drink and it was refreshing and delicious! we weren't hungry enough to try a waffle but we are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Food is rlly good, tastes fresh & not greasy or fattening. A little pricey, but worth it, you get what you pay for. They also have vegan options which is cool (:"}
{"text":"As I sit here recovering from the prior nights festivities, relaxed, content, and belly full from a hashtag breakfast sandwich(photo will follow), I'm actually debating whether to have a waffle dessert.  Being that I'm always in search for new and exciting places to experience, this place is now my goto coffee spot for the Vegas Road Trips. 

If you love Belgian waffles, you will enjoy these.  They make the Vegan batter here in the premises.  I'm not Vegan, but I am for the period of time it takes to scarf one. They have many of sandwiches and desserts to choose from, all made with waffles, including the Churronimo(a waffle churro), which I wolfed down yesterday.  

The coffee items that I've experienced so far are the Red Velvet Latte, speaks for itself, and the Espresso Frankenstein.  One would think the Frankenstein to be a very strong and intense drink, one would be correctamundo.  Four shots, ice, and agave, all blended together into a very light and frothy monster of a drink...don't be scared, try it!  Even though it's strong, it's not bitter strong.  You can really taste the roasted smoothness of the beans. 

Yes TIABI has hit a home run with me.  The staff is lively, informative, accommodating and diligent.  To the owners Mae and Tiffany I thank you."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon to try a new vegan option in Vegas. The PB&Banana waffle was tasty and I appreciated the house-made coconut bacon. My friend really liked his chicken and avocado waffle. The atmosphere could use a little love and I'd love an outdoor patio, but all and all a cute little spot."}
{"text":"I recently went to Tiabi with my wife. She had the kisses waffles, and I had the viva las Elvis waffles.  We also shared a west coast waffle sandwich. Everything came out well-presented, and the food was delicious. Not too sweet, not too salty, just right.  And although we ordered three items to share, it was not too heavy.  The service was superb. I only wish I lived closer so that I could make this a more regular thing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. Trust this picky Vegan...you're in the right place for waffles and coffee drinks. My wife likes the RedBull drink, I think it's called Rebel Punch?. I liked their waffles so much I had to recreate them at home. You can tell they are into the craft, and you have to respect that. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Decaf coffee flavorless. Was told that people don't know the taste of coffee that order decaf. Bacon was microwave, waffle thickness of toast. Two drinks and two waffles for over 20 bucks could have make better at home with my money. Guy at counter was super nice but he service wasn't enough to want to ever return.

The remark about the decaf coffee was made by the young lady who made the coffee. The flavor of your waffle was good. It was the quanity and quality of your other ingredients used that were not good especially for the price."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The best Waffles ever. Went here with my beautiful daughter and ordered the West Coast sandwich with house chips and a red velvet waffle with a 20 oz Coca-Cola and a 20 oz Dragonfruit Vitamin water.

First both waffles were cooked to perfection with a crisp crunchy texture and served warm fresh from the waffle iron.

The West Coast was loaded with chicken slices, bacon slices, avocado slices and tomato slices with Tiabi Sauce and cheese. 

The house chips were very good with a awesome seasoning that was a little sweet and savory. I'm glad I ordered them and I would recommend that everyone must try it for themselves. You'll thank me later.

The Red Velvet Waffle was topped with of chocolate chips, hot fudge and whipped cream. 

They have some great coffee drinks and other beverages to choose from.

There is free wifi and a roomy seating and study area and outlets to juice up your gadgets.

We will definitely be back for the best waffles that I have ever ate."}
{"text":"I was craving a good breakfast place when I found this little beauty. Oh man, did this place not disappoint. I got the maple bacon waffle. First off, I like bacon, but most of the time I feel like people overdo it. This, however, was the perfect amount of crisp, fresh bacon mixed into the BATTER and then cooked into an amazingly soft but crisp waffle. Offset the saltiness of the bacon with a sticky sweet maple syrup and you have a perfectly balanced waffle. I also got the honey cream latte. I do feel like the honey needed to be intensified a little more to cut through the bold taste of the espresso, but overall it was a nice fresh taste on a normal latte. Will definitely track this place down again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great selections and coffee! Waffles are too crispy..almost burnt! I would recommend asking for them not to cook your waffle so long, unless you like them that way!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp. we found this local waffle house before we headed back home. Attentive staff and a place with characters. Decent coffee (had to have their Waffle Macchiato...its dessert) only one thing missing was they could of roasted the almond on the Viva Las Elvis. 

Side note and its kind of unrelated: Why can we have a place like this in Tucson? Last time we had the lemon puppy seeds waffle at Mother hubbard's it was disaster...They effing poured the lemon syrup and sprinkled the puppy seeds over the plain waffle. And we waited for 45 min for that lousy waffle. Still pissed me off today!!! 
 
Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great fast service. Nice relaxing enviroment, especially if you are staying on the strip. Reasonable prices and portions."}
{"text":"Super yummy waffles and a great selection for vegans. Wish it wasn't so far from my side of town!"}
{"text":"Great vegan options and reasonably priced! Had the viva Elvis waffle with vegan coconut bacon and savory Thai bail sand which with vegan cheese. Both were really good!  All waffles are vegan so that's great to know. Coffee was really good ;)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I always try to find unique places in Vegas and this placed sounded just like that.

Why three stars? Well, it's a great idea for a business using waffles on every single plate but unfortunately their waffles are not unique.

We ordered:
- Kisses Waffle
- Golden Waffle
- Waffledilla 
- South West Sandwich
- Breakfast Sandwich 
- Americano
- Chai Latte
- tuxedo frap
- waffle caramel ice coffee

While the whole menu idea is creative, some of the waffles were burnt and crunchy. The kisses waffle, golden waffle and Waffledilla were so toasted that it would hurt to eat them.

All others were soft and done the right way. Flavor was ok but nothing to wow anybody. I just feel that they are missing something that makes their waffles in general stand out.

Their drinks were amazing. I would definitely come back for drinks. Tasty and several options available.

The Good:
- Great cafe in a random strip mall
- Nice Staff
- Great Drinks
- Only one of the very few places that have Stevia

The Bad:
- Burnt Waffles
- We got all coffees on to-go cups although we ate there. 
- No High-Chairs available"}
{"text":"If you are really hungry. This is not the place to order, waited for my food about 45 minutes. It was not as good as the reviews made it seem. I deff recommend Bruxie on Las Vegas Blvd, I mean it's very Good."}
{"text":"Just the way we like it!  

Nice and crispy waffle and bacon!  The waffle churro on Tiffs Waffle Macchiato was yummy.  The Waffledilla sauce was like a chipotle sauce and my son said really good!  Will be back...need to try desserts next!

Return visit:  always good!   Came here after a disappointing breakfast elsewhere...thank you Tiabi for saving me (and saving my husband from me being a crazy hungry caffeine deprived wife)"}
{"text":"My constant companion and I decided to try this place after an excursion to Target.  Despite living in the area, and walking as my primary mode of transportation, I hadn't noticed this place before as it is tucked away on the East side of the Target shopping center.

What a delightful find!  This corner of Las Vegas is not known for it's culinary delights, and Tiabi Coffee & Waffle is a gem.  We ordered a nutella, banana, and almond waffle which was delicious, and my constant companion ordered some sort of coffee.

Honestly, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but my constant companion didn't seem overly awestruck by the coffee.  The waffle was delicious, though, and the waffles at the tables near ours looked equally scrumptious.  I look forward to slowly eating my way through the entire menu in future visits.

I definitely recommend as this as one of the better breakfast places in the immediate area, and the waffles beat any of the waffle/crepe places I've eaten at on the Strip.  Definitely worth moving off the Blvd for a better breakfast meal at a much better price."}
{"text":"Saw a Groupon for Tiabis, decided to try it. It was very good. Using Waffles for the sandwich bread is great idea. Tried the wafflezilla and now the vegan burger. Tremendous! They're homemade are pretty amazing as well. Will be hurting this place up when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I came here about two years ago but the impression left on me was so great that I've been thinking about this place and had to write a review. My friend and I came here for some grub before a music festival and thought this place was unique and had great reviews. Those reviews did not disappoint.

I ordered a West Coast wafflewich and since I'm not the biggest fan of bacon, they allowed me to sub it out for ham. This one entree was freakin' amazing, and I need to come back to Vegas to eat here again. I think my friend ordered one of the sweet waffle entrees, and I'm sure that was good too but I don't quite remember.

The place itself looked nice, and the service was great. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on 3 separate occasions. Loved everything we tried! The 3rd time I came, service was a bit slow and had to get my stuff to go, but it's because so many people enjoy eating here. 
1. Green smoothies are always good.
2. I love their lollies."}
{"text":"Fantastic waffles.  Good coffee.  Chill atmosphere.  

Tried all the Tiabi Classic waffles.  No complaints.  U don't like their preselected options, you can create your own.  

Staff is always chill.  

People sometimes complain about the wait, but that's what happens when your food is fresh and made to order.  

If you're short on time, this is not your best option.  This is a dish best served when you've gots time to chillax... and then go hit the pools and get turnt up."}
{"text":"Decor: 4/5
-looks like a local coffee shop with large tables and benches

-Service: 5/5
-Israel greet us as we walked in and took our order. Our drinks were done in a few minutes and the food was ready in less than ten minutes

-Food: 4/5
-Snickers ice coffee didn't taste like snickers however it was a good sweet ice coffee drink
-The west coast wafflewich was great. I'm a big fan of avocado and bacon. The chicken was not try at all. Recommend this one
-Savory Thai Basil - I tried this one because it was unique. Overall I felt the flavor was slightly lacking but can't put my finger on it. I think it needs more crunch and flavor.
-I was impressed that the waffles stayed crispy on the outside, soft on the inside"}
{"text":"Sad to see that the location in North Las Vegas closed. There's no way I'd go all the way to Maryland Parkway to get my coffee fix though. Their coffee is amazing, their waffle sandwiches are okay. A little pricey for what it is. I'm really gonna miss the coffee on my side of town!"}
{"text":"Great waffles & nice ambiance. Service was friendly and the food selection was pretty good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but not a place I'm dying to come back. Very low key place. Staff are friendly. Still on the hunt for a waffle place that meets all expectations for sweet and savory."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday and it was really busy. The wait took forever because the amount of people there. There's also a limited amount of tables available. And from what I saw, they only had three waffle makers. You would expect a waffle place to have more waffle makers than just three, which probably added to the wait. Unless, they have more waffle makers hidden from view, which makes the waiting a little worse if they do. However, I suppose the waffles were worth the wait.

They are pretty cheap for a big (at least for me) sized waffle. Here in California, waffles that big cost about $9-$10 but in Vegas, they were half the price. They have a variety of different waffles to choose from if you prefer waffles or a waffle sandwich. They even have a vegan menu if that's for you. They also have a huge variety of drinks.

I'll definitely be back here again when I return to Vegas. I look forward to trying the different waffles and drinks on their menu."}
{"text":"Skip the strip people, this place is so cool.  It is almost impossible to please my little family when we are traveling.  My main concern is always getting a good cappuccino and coffee house food is not a satisfactory option for my teen so this gem of a cafe was an awesome find!  Everyone got what they wanted, the food was delicious, and made with love.  The people were super friendly and the ambiance is both casual and welcoming.  I've eaten at many of the well known places on the strip and have frequently been disappointed.  Venture out to Tiabi Coffee and Waffles, you will be so glad you did"}
{"text":"Great lattes and frappes. Good waffles. Prices are reasonable and they have vegan options. Waffle sandwich was good and so was the red velvet frappe."}
{"text":"I've tried this place for the first time last week. A friend of mine and I came over to grab dessert and I have to say we made the right choice. 

It's very cute and clean inside. There are magazines and couches to lounge on and there are decks of cards to play with on each table. They also have board games to keep you entertained.The staff is also very nice and helpful on their suggestions. 

Their waffles are delicious! They are the perfect texture and go well with ice cream. I will definitely be coming back to try their Churronimo!"}
{"text":"The coffee was the best part of my meal! My husband and I both got waffle sandwiches and the waffle itself was thin which is perfect and tasty but I had one with chicken and the chicken tasted like that pre-packed stuff. Got the coffee with the cinnamon waffle on top and the waffle was awesome on that so I would go back just for sweet waffles and coffee."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had the #breakfast sandwich, west coast sandwich, red velvet lollipop, and strawberry sunrise smoothie and everything was delicious. Employees are helpful and friendly too. Matter of time before lines are out the door!"}
{"text":"BY FAR MY FAVORITE FOOD SPOT IN LAS VEGAS!

The food, drinks & service are AMAZE BALLS! lol.
Saw that there was a Groupon but we wanted to try it out first.
We ended up buying the Groupon because we knew we would be back for the remainder of our stay :)

You walk in & the menu is to the left. 
I love how it's set up, cafe & you can see them making the food.
They take your order & ask for your name (they will call you name when your order is ready)

The FOODS:
- Lemonade: So yummy! Sweet, just how I like it!
- Tiff's Waffle Macchiato: THE BEST DRINK EVERRRR! lol. It comes with a waffle that is dusted with cinnamon sugar, it's messy but worth the mess. So yummers!
- Pac-Man Waffle: Exactly what it sounds like. Pac-Man shaped waffle with blueberries & raspberries as the thing that Pac-Man eats. Lol. Super cute!
- Vegan Wafflewich: Tomato, spring mix, avocado & Tiabi sauce toasted. Pretty much like a salad in a waffle, sandwich styled. Sooooo good! I ordered this with the Macchiato every time I went here.

The employees are AMAZING! They remembered us & they're super friendly.

I totally recommend this place, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here consistently due to the aesthetics of the place, the service and most of all, the food.

This place brings out elements to food and combining it together and it turns into one hell of a dish. No lies. Good stuff.

Shouting out John/Jay? for ALWAYS giving bomb recommendations! First timers, ask them. They'll surprise you."}
{"text":"OMG I would be here every day if Tiabi were in my neighborhood!! Waffles are one of my faaaaaaavorite foods and these waffles do not disappoint. I think these might be the best waffles I've ever had. And when they are made into a wafflewich?!? Wowwwww, that's just.....wowwwww. So freaking good!!! We ordered the breakfast wafflewich, the Thai basil wafflewich and the bananatella on our first visit here. We came here twice in 3 days. Luckily it wasn't hard to convince my husband to come back since he thought these were delicious too! Yessss! Waffles FTW!!! :)

On our 2nd visit we got another Thai basil wafflewich (obviously our favorite!!!), the west coast wafflewich, the maple bacon, and the Elvis (with bacon, honey, AND peanut butter! All were delicious, can't say a bad thing about any of these waffles. 

Thank you Tiabi for the awesome service too, we will def be back!"}
{"text":"Bomb waffles! And great (nutty) tasting pistachio iced lattes. I had just a the plain waffle, it was super tasty. A dance party for my taste buds :)"}
{"text":"Quiet, clean, friendly and delicious! What more could you ask for?

I stopped by when I lost my voice. I got the most amazing green tea and I'm addicted. I also give a thumbs up for the churro waffle; I just wish I had eaten there while it was still piping hot. (I didn't want to get anyone else sick )

Very nice hidden gem."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our first breakfast after we got married! It was SO GOOD. Really fun and friendly staff - tasty waffles and great options. I was worried it might be too sweet because I don't have a huge sweet tooth but it was perfect! I couldn't recommend it highly enough! And it's not too pricey either."}
{"text":"My last visit was not on par with my other visits. Service was okay, waffle was okay, and it was pretty slow getting my order even when the place was empty. Plus, the waffle wasn't the gloriously crispy goodness it usually is.

Maybe it's because it wasn't breakfast time, but it was a disappointing meal and I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What is tiabi you ask? \"To inspire and be inspired.\" What an awesome statement. This little waffle shop/cafe is a vegas gem. It's one of those home town places where you want to bring your friends. You can hangout and have brunch or stop by for a late snack and dessert. They have all different types of waffles that will satisfy your craving. I personally love the waffledilla. It's the cheapest waffle sandwhich and will melt in your mouth! It's chicken, cheese, special sauce (that is sooooo yummy) in between a waffle folded in half and is super scrumptious. You can add a fruit bowl (variety so I'd ask what kind they have that day in case you are allergic or don't like a certain type of food) or homemade chips just for $1! Sweet deal! And it's pretty much a meal. They have a water pitcher towards the back. But they also have teas and smoothies. I haven't tried the smoothies but I want to! I like the \"Just Peachy\" tea. It's not too sweet but has a good taste. I always suggest this place because it's very central, it's cheap, they have dessert waffles too (try the red velvet) and they're friendly. It's located inside the Target plaza so there's a lot of traffic goin on around the place. But definitely a place to try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"AMAZING WAFFLES! I love to come here for coffee and waffles on my mornings off work. The employees are always friendly. I sit down with a book, and someone brings my food to me. There isn't a lot of seating, but I have never seen it completely full (yet). This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Vegas."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a poor review for them because they are super nice and cute concept. We have tried this place multiple times wanting to love it. We always have a super long wait, I'm talking 45 min for two waffles, there is no consistency (order is ALWAYS different) and our orders are always wrong. To wait 45 min for cold wrong food is just so disappointing. Missing key items that are listed on the menu like whipped cream on a waffle that literally has 3 toppings is just sad and inexcusable or missing items you specifically ask for every single time is just not good."}
{"text":"Really rude service, drive 4 hours to Las Vegas and look for a sweet treat after a long trip, and they tell us \"we're closing early so we can only make drinks to go.\" You might as well tell us \"we don't feel like working; we wanna go home and enjoy our weekend even though you're paying for our paycheck. Really rude girl at the counter, said something about having to close early because it's slow day, but you can't stay open for 10more minutes ?? Keep in mind we got here at .7:30 and they're supposed to close at 8."}
{"text":"This place is very quaint. It reminds me of a small business in northern California. My favorite is the West Coast with a Kale Champ. This it's my favorite new spot. I hope the Las Vegas residents appreciate the new private business Tiabi has to offer. Both Tiffany and Mae are awesome and super sweet. The customer service is enough to keep you returning. Thanks ladies."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today and already I can't wait to come back. The waffles were simply delicious! We got one with Nutella, almonds and whipped cream. It was actually pretty big too, and not expensive at all. The menu was pretty big for a tiny place like that. Another good thing is that they make a real Italian style espresso. The staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy their work."}
{"text":"Very good food and service! The waffles are perfect consistency and the drinks flavorful.  Please build one in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"My Vegas family and I met here when we were visiting Las Vegas. Great,simple delicious food! It's like breakfast sandwiches,but served on waffles! The coffee's wonderful too! The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had a group of seven adults and two children,and no reservations,as none of us made them!They let us sit at a large table that another group had reserved.(Some of that party had an emergency;and it was ok with the half of the group that was there.) Some of us waited a bit to get our food,but I didn't mind, as we were visiting.Our family was there for two hours!-I'm surprised they didn't ask us to leave?! The staff was just so nice!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends yesterday and we shared a number of items. As I walked in, I noticed how lovely it smelled and was excited to try their waffles.
 
We sat and perused the menu for a while and I was a little disappointed that no one really checked on us or even asked if we wanted waters or more menus than just the one for our group of three. We finally figured out what we wanted and went up to the counter to order.

The lady behind he counter kept interrupting my dining companion as he started to order by yelling behind to another person who worked there. I thought that was a little rude, so that definitely put me off.

Our food took a while to come, but it looked really pretty. 

What we ordered:
-red velvet wafflenut 
-Nutella and almond wafflenut 
-The Fat Elvis waffle
-Strawberry and chocolate waffle
-Vegas churro waffle with honey, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla ice cream

Everything was solid. The consensus was that the churro waffle was the favorite and I personally enjoyed the strawberry waffle, minus the chocolate sauce. 

Service needs work and the location is awkward, so I don't see myself making much effort to come back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious pumpkin latte best I've ever had. I order this at many different coffee shops and always get a sugar punch to the throat. This one is not over syrup grossness, it's perfect. The organic toasty Tokyo is light and delicious too!"}
{"text":"The West Coast and Kettle Chips are life changing. Love this place. Their juices/smoothies are good too."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have delicious cold brew coffee, and several different amazing vegan options.  My absolute favorite thing on the menu is The Guru Burger.  After I tried it once I haven't been able to order anything else, I'm totally hooked!  A tip for ordering the Guru Burger is adding avocado and daiya cheese, now you have the perfect waffle sandwich!  Also make sure to check the cookie case on the counter for a variety of fresh baked cookies!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place with style. I ordered Kale Champ blendies. It pretty awesome. Taste good and feel healthy! Little hidden gem around Target
 building."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place for when I have a sweet tooth. The establishment seems very clean and has a mixed modern but slightly rustic feel to it. It has plenty of seating and I find that even if it's full, it's never too loud. The food is always great! I usually get the bananutella with a churro waffle and ice cream (a 10 year olds dream breakfast). The coffee is also exceptional. I find that for the price, this is the best of the best if you want a quality waffle meal in a quality waffle place."}
{"text":"Eagles with pecan nut and caramel are the best!!
Special \"star\" giving you for coffee guys.
Latte was great!"}
{"text":"Full from a weekend of eating buffets in Vegas?  Think again.  While you may be stuffed to the core, what you thought was going to be a to go stop at Tiabi Coffee & Waffle will end up being a sit down eat everything on your plate once they serve it to you no matter how full you are kind of afternoon.

It's just that good.  While you thought you were full, you didn't realize how hungry you were once you take a bite out of one of their delicious desserts, that they serve to you on a plate since it looks better that way than to go."}
{"text":"Came her with my hubby and grandma for the first time. I was impressed with the Viva Las Elvis Waffle with in house made Vegan Coconut Bacon! The sweet and salty combo makes it a delight. Order an extra one to go for my mom to try. Will definitely come back again!"}
