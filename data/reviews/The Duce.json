{"text":"Had an outing with the girl's, and it was great first time here and I'll definitely be going back. Great food!!!! The Duce  itself is quite different,  but food. I recommend it"}
{"text":"Unique environment. Good food (meatball and brisket sliders) and lemonade cocktails on a sunny fall afternoon."}
{"text":"I love this place! I think it's totally yummy and fun!!! The staff is 100% rad. I felt like I was at this amazing place with all types of neat secrets~ kinda like home sweet home;)"}
{"text":"My first trip to the Duce was to see the Scandalesque show there.  I had no idea what to expect, which was good, because I would have been wrong.

Inside The Duce, you'll find the following:  a very casual restaurant, a boxing ring, a vintage (REAL vintage, not the fake-vintage hipster fodder) clothing store, an ice cream bar, a tiny boutique-ish grocery area, a caf√©, and (coming soon) a pie shop.

I can only review the restaurant part. The dining area has walls, but no ceiling, making the atmosphere interesting. It also made the atmosphere REALLY COLD ... half of the propane heaters weren't turned on.  The menu is small, with mostly brunch items and sliders, but they do have a few salads and larger plates.  The salads our group ordered were delicious, and the sliders were original and surprisingly fresh. I also had a side of their homemade beans and cole slaw.  The beans seemed to be sweetened with maple syrup to the point where I almost couldn't finish them.  The slaw was just flat-out odd; I still have no idea what was in it.  But it was also incredibly tasty! 

On the down side, I think the management is still trying to figure out how to run the place; they seemed overwhelmed by the crowd even before it got very crowded.   But I have faith that this will work itself out. Parking is pretty sparse, but this is downtown; you should expect that. And some of the pricing on the menu doesn't make any sense:  a gourmet salad was only $5, but a tiny dollop of baked beans was $3.50? I hope they make some adjustments soon."}
{"text":"Great concept, poor delivery.  This place is very confusing.  We went on a Wednesday around 7:00 p.m.  When we entered, we weren't sure if I needed to wait to be seated or find our own table.  There are very few tables, most seat 8 to 10 people and are very large picnic style.  There is no wait staff. We eventually found our way to the bar,  The bartender told us he could take our order, but it would be better to go to the \"girl\" standing by the trailer.  We ordered at the bar.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food, as advertised.  They call your name over a loud speaker to  pick up your food at the trailer.  There are no signs where to pick up.  The cook finally yelled to us to go to the back of the trailer.

We had the Mac and Cheese muffins, chicken pot pie in the jar and maple ribs.  The mac and cheese muffins were very bland.  The chicken pot pie was just okay.  The ribs were covered in sauce which seemed to hide the real favor of the rib.

This place is trying to be a trendy, hipster place, but got lost along the way. The boxing ring and clothing store are great concepts to help entertain.  Staff up, put in seating for smaller parties and revisit the menu."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. They also make great drinks! I wish they had live music though"}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews of the Duce before agreeing to meet loved ones there for brunch.  The reviews would have told me everything I needed to know.  Rude, inattentive staff, confusing lay out, ridiculously priced drinks, and good food if they aren't out of it.  $12 for a bloody mary?  I don't think they even charge that at the Jade Bar at Sanctuary.  We should have gone to Windsor which has $5 bloody marys for brunch.  No wonder we were the ONLY people eating brunch. I was infuriated with the lackadaisical attitude of the order takers and the \"cooler than thou\" vibe of the bartender...wow...muddling an olive into \"organic\" vodka is really cool! and the fact that there was no effort at all to assist navigating the confusing layout.  Drinks and food from separate areas..just a clusterf*** of a concept.  I don't think the owner is reading these reviews because the only thing that is constant is how bad the service is.  I will never waste another dime there."}
{"text":"Great times and drinks. Their pancake event that happened earlier this year was not very good. The pancakes were not fully cooked and they only had two people cooking."}
{"text":"Ended up at the duce on NYE right before the ball dropped. They were serving hot cereal, Skillet scrambles, baked pancakes and hot coffee drinks along with all the other goodies they create in their 65' Airstream trailer turned kitchen and cocktails from behind the bar of what the owner told us used to service Chicagoans before, during and after prohibition. 

This place is to cool for school.  Everybody that worked there was donned in pajamas, robes and slippers as were many of what appeared to be \"duce regulars\".

 Food, cocktails, old school gym, amazing clothing store, ping pong, shuffle board and corn hole...or as they call it...\"duce bag\". 

best NYE ever!!!"}
{"text":"A Trip Down Alice's Rabbit Hole,....

My first beer was literally spent just trying to take in what was before my eyes.  This is a place not to be judged by it's cover.  Upon entering this shanty with a vague sense of hesitation, I was immediately overwhelmed by the insanity of colors, objects, and decorum that resided behind the door.  

After my senses calmed and I started to focus on specifics, the classic tunes were the final cap to an overall very unique and enjoyable atmosphere.  One in which you have absolutely no choice but to smile.

The fact that the place makes you smile probably has something to do with the fact that everyone, and i mean everyone looked to be having a good time.  I'm a people watcher by nature, so noticed which people were initially interacting.  As the evening progressed, the canned music and karaoke actually spawned a ton of intermingling of the group, random couples dancing, a couple of trains, and a whole ton of fun for all.

This is truly an atmosphere that welcomes all, old and young.....I saw everyone of all ages, up to, I swear, a 90 something with a walker.....who was sporting that smile I mentioned previously.

The staff, amazing....friendly and professional, and will remember your name if you give it.  They clearly show this is an establishment built on love.....The only thing I noticed that was a negative, mentioned as a warning for your mind before hand, there can be a bit of a wait for the drinks......Why?.....they are hand made, and i don't mean poured from a bottle, hand made,.....i mean, if you order a greyhound, the bartender hand squeezes the grapefruit fresh from a basket.  I saw a couple that had to wait a bit in line for their drinks, you could see a bit of frustration for the wait.  However, upon tasting their drinks, each one was well satisfied.  One man said, 'OMG, this is perfect.'  another lady said, 'this is true heaven, whats in here?'  So tolerate a wait if you must, because you won't be disappointed.  The reason, told to me by the Carol, the mother of the owner, they use all fresh, local grown produce in everything....They make it all, nothing comes from a bottle, from salad dressing on up.  The booze is organic if they can get it.

Hopes this helps, and please, stop driving by it and wondering if it is some kind of weird flee market.  Before you walk in the door, leave everything that is bothering you there, step through looking for a good time, and I promise you will find it."}
{"text":"I'm not looking to go back, despite a few positives.  This place just wasn't for me - some of that is on me, some of it's on the place.

The place is trying really hard to be different and doing in a way that all looks the same.

Beer list was overpriced and awful.  I'm OK with that though, because they had a good list of mixed drinks.  Cheap beer in cans at a large markup or crafted cocktails.  That is what this place does and I don't mind paying for a cocktail.  Except most of the cocktails tasted were just too sweet or not really well balanced.  Also, while I get trying to keep up with that whole mason jar retro thing that used to be interesting - if you are hand crafting cocktails then you should put some care into how you serve them.  Glassware makes a difference.

Another thing that makes a difference is having bartenders that actually seem like they care to take your drink order - I just couldn't find one and it's a huge part of the reason why we left.  Our group went 3 rounds and each one took forever.  Not only to get the bartenders attention when you are pretty much the only one there waiting, but to have them actually made.

Another reason for leaving was that the seating was flat out uncomfortable.  Again, I get the vintage project feel they were going for.  It just isn't enjoyable.  There is a reason why those designs were left rust.  

The parking, as mentioned by many others, is awful.

It was nice sitting outside.  It was a very open space.  If you enjoy dancing there was a large area for it with people actually dancing.  Although poorly executed there is potential to have a decent cocktail scene.  There is a pretty diverse scene there.

However, so much of that space brings no function to actually enhancing what I want when going out for drinks with friends.

A gift shop with other novelties - yeah, no.

A boxing ring? - I love boxing, but pointless other than to say that you have a boxing ring.

Ping Pong, cornhole, etc?  Sure - I've been known to play at bars that have these things - just not that many options to play for such a large space and watching strangers play games isn't exactly as fun as playing yourself.

That weird retro kitchen art type installation - again, why?

The place can get away with a lot of these space wasters, because they have so much space and it's easy to just walk past to find what you do want.  

However, for what I would want - a comfortable place with tasty drinks and good service that is easy to interface with - this place fails.

It was an inconvenient mess from the moment I entered the valet chute........."}
{"text":"Great drinks and cool food!! Mac n chz muffins are off the hook!! Ping pong, karaoke, random boxing ring, clothing store and DJ make this place super unique. The only downfall is there is no a/c and the drinks are a little pricey but other than that it's a cool spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Inside has so much going on, we went exploring while we were waiting for our food. The entire staff was very friendly. We had strawberry lemonades, chicken pot pies, and the noodle kugel. All delicious!"}
{"text":"Weird, mid-2000s Portland attempt. Loud music. Slow service. Cool vintage army clothes. However, I give them credit for giving me my $ back when I complained that the food was taking too long (40 minutes with zero other orders before me)."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times , love it here, music, drinks, food, desserts are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! It's something different. Love their food, music and the vibe. I recommend the meatball slide sampler. The only reason I'm not giving it a five is because I think their menu is a little over priced. But overall good place to hang out with your date and friends."}
{"text":"I live in Albuquerque and want a 'Duce location here!!  I was in Phoenix visiting some friends for my birthday and went here for breakfast/lunch on a Sunday.  I love the old converted Airstream kitchen and the antique and vintage touches all over the place.  The food was excellent, atmosphere so fun and the service was super friendly!!  They even heard us talking about it being my birthday and brought over some amazing s'more sweet potato cheesecake with a candle on top and sang to me!  It was too-die-for!!!  What a great place, although I did feel a lil' guilty watchin' the people in the room next to us breaking a good sweat doin' a circuit-training class.  But they all were smiling and happy to enjoy the delicious menu after.  On my way out I wandered over to the clothing shop side of the restaurant and bought a cool funky t-shirt.  I am sold on the whole building and vibe of The 'Duce and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"We went to The Duce for a group, family dinner this evening. This place has it all! Original scenery, drinks, and food. Great for all ages, with a verity of fun games
to do. The owner gave our kids (and some parents) a little boxing lesson. He is a class act. The Duce is a gem in this desert. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just went dancing at The Duce. DJ Tiger is THE BEST! I'd love to hire him for my wedding. Also the drinks are delicious. Love the vibe here. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The Duce is magical. My first time I was introduced to the place was on the London Bus Pub Crawl, got great drinks, danced and poof had to leave. Came back for a Friday night Karaoke, met up with some friends and just relaxed and enjoyed the evening, so much to do, games, ping pong, bags, you name it. My hubby and I loved The Duce so much that we got married there (we also shared our first kiss on that Karaoke night). Ellen is awesome, the owners are amazing people, our most important day was perfect, every person had a great time, young and more wise alike. Best food, super shakes and old school beer with premium bar, I cannot say I love this place more! We are patrons for life."}
{"text":"I like the venue itself-cute vibe and all that. However the older blond bartender I encountered ruined my evening there when I went last Friday. First off I went to order the special, strawberry lemonade, and they were out of strawberries. So after waiting FOREVER to be helped she made me a raspberry something or other - which was awful I might add. So I tipped her a buck and walked away. Then my bank app alerted me that instead of charging me the $11.91 for the shitty drink she charged $111.91. So I go up calmly to ask about it and she was totally rude telling me she already had voided it. No apologies or anything. Basically... shit bartender+over priced bad drinks+mediocre dj+heat = lame experience"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a different change of pace this will hit the spot. The food is great and the portions are huge. We went on a Sunday morning and there was like cross fit type of thing going on which was a weird site for such a cool place."}
{"text":"I had a below average experience during my first time at The Duce. First off, 2 of the menu items I asked for they were either out of or they no longer serve.  The salad I ordered for 7 dollars was as basic as a 3 dollar add on at a comparable restaurant.  The challa bread brisket is a great idea and tastes pretty good.  The alcoholic beverages are unique and taste great. I will also mention that the items in the vintage store are over priced.  The clerks there are not very friendly, in fact, they kept starring at my group of 4 as though we were going to steal something (which was very far from the truth). I may not go back, but I recommend that others check it out purely for the unique venue and good drinks."}
{"text":"Really cool place if you're ready to hang out and party. Went there on a Saturday night, they had a fun dance floor going with a DJ playing some 80s & 90s throwbacks. In addition, they have 3-4 ping pong tables, boxing ring, corn hole and a retro clothing shop for entertainment. You definitely need to check this place out if you're in Phoenix for the weekend. Super fun and did I mention they have Old Style?!?! Heeeeeck yea"}
{"text":"Nobody puts Baby by the dumpster! 
They have no bike racks, or any place that is easy to lock up too. Their solution is the chainlink fence by the dumpster and a shrug of their shoulders, ugh. No thank you."}
{"text":"After having high expectations from hearing many friends rave about The Duce, I was EXTREMELY disappointed after visiting. To begin: no parking. Whatsoever. For a sunday afternoon at 3, I had to park a block away. Upon arrival, it was very cute. However, walking in was just as confusing as parking. The place was hectic, which is understandable, but no employees were anywhere to be found. Finally, we had to walk up to the bar to ask where to order. After being told where, we looked over the menu. Alright menu, small selection, a little expensive but we figured we would try something after all the effort to come here. Upon ordering, I asked the cashier if I could have a certain drink. She replied \"I can't make that right now\" okay... Asked for a pie jar \"sorry we are out\" okay.... Asked for the egg sliders \"okay that'll be a 45 min wait..\" Okay time to go. We are now eating at a nearby Jimmy Johns - and we are MUCH more satisfied. Cool concept, but needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"I have been to the Duce a number of times for get together. Huge eclectic space, awesome comfort food and awesome service, lovely organic prohibition era cocktails, really wonderful eclectic open-air atmosphere. Next Time,  I would try at night to see the vibe and have drinks at their antique bar. This place is great, try it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"This place is a blast!  I came here for the first time for my birthday and everyone had so much fun- we had a big table and enjoyed sliders, alcoholic shakes, organic and freshly squeezed drinks, karaoke and dancing.  There is so much to see and do here! No A/C in the summer and parking is limited, but this is hands down one of the best and unique places in Phoenix!  I want to go back for the swing dancing!"}
{"text":"Great place and experience. Food and beer cocktails were great. The scene is laid back and fun. There is something for everyone here. Enjoy it for what it is a great retro bar serving old school beer you wont find anywhere else so don't be whining for the latest micro brew or looking for the Scottsdale scene here. Parking is easy in the back alley and side streets. On weekend nights I'd like to see a separate entrance if you want to go just for the food and not have to pay the cover for the band. A fun place for kids too."}
{"text":"Love this place! All the food I've tried is tasty- get the Chicken Pot Pie or any of the sliders. The mac and cheese muffins are tasty, and darling. Everything I've had has been delicious. For drinks- I am on a makers mark kick so I loved the Old Fashioned and the Brown Derby. Fresh juice, so tasty. The decor is a little insane, like some chick's pinterest account exploded on everything, but there's so much to do, so much to look at! There's a freaking boxing ring in the middle! You can play corn hole (beanbags) and ping pong. I have been bringing people here a lot lately. It's just such a fun place!"}
{"text":"This place is very intriguing!  I love the old-reclaimed atmosphere in downtown Phoenix.
There is ALOT going on at The Duce and it is hard to take it all in at one visit.  The staff there were very helpful and introduced us to different venues.
We had dinner and enjoyed the variety of sliders, salads and corn coins.  I think their lemonade is some of the BEST.  They are very reasonably priced also.
4 stars?  No diet drinks!  You would think that they would at least carry a TAB!
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in downtown Phoenix! There's a little something for every one there and we sure needed a place like this. The clothing store has an Anthropologie vibe to it along with the high prices, but it's fun to look! There are fun home accessory items too.

After you finish browsing you can have a soda at the soda fountain, coffee at the coffee bar, a drink in the lounge, cartoons on the vintage bleachers or some grub outside at the vintage travel trailer. Oh, and I forgot to mention the vintage gym area! 

I opted for some food and had the pear and pecan salad. It was actually a decent size for five bucks, but was nothing memorable and the greens were wilted and brown. I enjoyed the corn coins very much though as well as the lemonade, which is sweetened with honey. The ordering process though is a bit confusing. We were greeted by a very helpful guy who told us all about the food but he never took our order. He finally told us we needed to come up to the trailer and order. There should probably be a sign - especially since the menus are at the table. Also, you can't order a drink unless you go over to the lounge area in another room even though there are also drink menus at the table.  If you want lemonade though you can get it yourself at a counter next to the trailer, but you have to walk over to the lounge to get ice. You also have to give a nickname when you order your food. It's a cute idea, but by the time my name was called to pick up my food I had forgotten what my nickname was. And it's also hard to come up with a clever nickname on the spot. 

Even thought there are some kinks to be worked out, I'm already thinking of some nickname options for another visit soon. I want to try the apple pancake next!"}
{"text":"We were referred by a friend and had a great night out at The Duce. If you are looking for a unique experience out with clients and friends The Duce will not disappoint. Check it out next time you go to downtown Phoenix for a concert or sporting event.
Good time fo sho."}
{"text":"Very good experience, the vallet boys that park your car are very cute. Also burger sliders 10/10."}
{"text":"The May special, buttermilk breaded chicken sliders, is excellent. Be prepared to wait a little longer for the order, they don't rush it. The side order of crisps was very small and expensive. I would not recommend it, especially for sharing. Over this place is great for family and friends. I will visit again."}
{"text":"I have read about the creation of this place almost two years ago and made a note to visit it.  Opened as a surplus store with vintage clothing, but now offers malts/shakes, brunch, happy hour type menu, kuegel, retro drinks, boxing ring, etc.  Stopped by on a Sunday after a disappointing visit to a downtown festival.  Loved it.  The building is gorgeous.  The staff was helpful but not overly intrusive.  The owner, Steve, took genuine interest into our insight and satisfaction regarding his place.   I don't like the reviews bashing their old-school beer offerings.  That is what they tout, and that is what you will get.  We love Hamm's, Schlitz, Old Style, and PBR (even though so many places offer it now) and love the matching, retro beer glasses they are served in.  I also had the best Greyhound I have ever had.  If you don't like the pricing, you obviously are oblivious to the cost of freshly squeezing juice, organic liquor, muddling fresh fruit, etc.  The patio next to the gulfstream trailer is adorable and can't wait to come back at night!"}
{"text":"Really fun place. Corn hole, ping pong and a whole lot more. Atmosphere was great but the food not so much. May have been an off night as there were several parties going on. Took over an hour to get our food. First order of mac n cheese muffins arrive cold.  Chicken pot pie was pretty good minus the crust. Sliders, nothing to write home about.  Over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place!!!! When I first moved to Arizona I didn't know where to go party, but then I was introduced to this awesome place.. I love it everyone is super friendly and their food is delicious.... they have a lot of fun stuff and when I come here to party I just feel alive :) I'm glad to have the Duce in my life :)"}
{"text":"Eccentric place, pretty cool... But the drinks are over priced and you can't taste the alcohol AT ALL."}
{"text":"This place was really fun. The bar is limited but the drinks they do have are very tasty. It is like a Playland for adults. Food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Been a fan since we walked through the door and explored 14,000 sq ft of fun.  Tips for others would be 1-come with a nickname 2- order drinks at the bar, food at the airstream and 3- don't be afraid to ask someone what the story is if you aren't sure how to navigate the grounds...  

Love the Duce in that it is community friendly and very inclusive.  For those who like to work before play, join a small group of fitness friends for Punch, Crunch and Brunch Sundays @ 10am.  Get your workout in, and then your drink on... great way to kick-off your Sunday."}
{"text":"Ok let me just say (like I am sure many before me have) What is this place? It is something that you just can't quite describe, it looks like a cross between one of the gyms rocky trained in that was in a warehouse somewhere, the auction block and seating at the county fair, with sprinkles of a garage sale that has a DJ rocking out to shopping for a used t shirt for .50 cents. But seriously I give these guys a huge thumbs up for originality, there is no place I have EVER seen quite like the duce or even close for that matter. We didn't eat so I can't review the food, but my margarita was really good and made with all fresh and organic ingredients. It is definitely an interesting way to pass a couple of hours before a Sun's game It is worth a stop and check it out."}
{"text":"Slowest service of any place I have ever been. Never prepared for the crowd. Wait 45 mins for sliders, then another 20 minutes to get a drink. If they had faster service to get food and drinks out, they would sell way more every night. Instead, I ate my food and finished my one drink and left. I watched people walk away when they heard 45 mins for food at 730. For sliders.... Come on! Didn't have their signature dish on a Saturday before 8?!? Great concept, but horrible service and wait times. Get staffed properly and maybe I'll be back."}
{"text":"The places location put me on edge but the atmosphere inside made up for it. However, when I went to order my food I found it over priced and the server threw away my ticket after I had paid. This meaning I did not receive my food for another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes for an order, the rest of our party finished eating we went to check on it they said another 10-15 minutes. Tried to get a refund and that was an ordeal as well. Just horrendous service, I would not recommend ordering food here."}
{"text":"My wife said and I'd have to agree with her, \"it's a pretty cool concept, better to enjoy during the winter and if you can stand the smell of moth balls!\""}
{"text":"The Good: 
The restaurant has a nice theme, the food is okay, and they play good music. Overall it is a pretty neat place. There is a nice outdoor theme with a retail area.

The Bad:
I had arrived at 7:00pm and sat at an open table. Note the table behind our group was label \"Reserved 6:00pm\". Even though is was 7:00 we sat at the adjacent table that was not labeled. After many of our friends arrived, we had ordered drinks and food and were seated and eating. At 8:13pm, a group of people began sitting at the reserved table across from ours. The wait staff came by and told us we had to leave because the table we were at was reserved. Not only did the party arrive two hours late, but the wait staff was willing to honor their reservation. I spoke with one of the manager's to hopefully find a way to accommodate our party. After asking one of the managers what time the reservation was for, she stated it was on the paper on our table. I had informed her there was no paper except on the other table. She apologized and said she would find us other seating, then she began to tell me the reservation was for 8:00pm. I would have been fine with the situation, but the manager had to lie directly to me. As nice a time as I had with my friends, I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone. The treatment I had received was very rude and did not provide good customer service."}
{"text":"Pros: cool atmosphere, lots of activities, interesting food, sustainable/organic alcohol 

Cons: HOT. They must not use a/c... Lack of parking, overpriced drinks"}
{"text":"We had our wedding and reception at the Duce.  Ashley did a wonderful job of helping us plan and then managing the event.  Our guests loved the venue and raved about the food and drinks.  It was a second wedding for both of us and we wanted something different, fun and casual. The Duce was perfect!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Saw it on DDD and have been waiting for a chance to go ever since. I had the Mac and Cheese Muffins and the Chicken Pot Pie Jar. Both did not disappoint!  I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese Muffins. There's enough to share with others as it is almost a meal by itself. Another friend had the cheeseburger sliders and they were not just your average slider. Had a pesto flavor with it and the meat was very high-quality tasting. The Maple BBQ ribs were very tasty. We also sampled the Duce Lemonade and Mojitio. Both were spot on, the Mojitio had a nice flavorful twist that made it stand out from what I normally have tasted. I recommend either one. We can't wait to go back again and try out the rest of the menu. Hopefully we can try out the pong pong tables too!"}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers,we had no trouble finding a parking place. But our big problem was trying to figure out why anyone would want to come here in first place. 

During recent lunch-hour weekday visit (place was essentially empty except for two guys at bar, a bewildered tourist trying to figure out what was going on and a few employees, one on floor painting signs), you may well feel you have  stumbled into some sort of boho work-in-progress in an old block-long warehouse in charm-free neighborhood south of downtown proper. 

Cheery young female employee who greeted us tried to explain what the mind-reeling business operation was all about--but it was pretty clear she wasn't very sure herself.  Is it a bar? A  gym? A restaurant? A clothing store? A concert venue? A tax write-off? Take your pick.

Walk into this industrial cavern and you must immediately navigate a weird obstacle course fronted by a boxing ring (a souvenir from a past tenant? who knows? and why put it right in front there when rest of building has plenty of other space?) , followed by a few makeshift kiosks stocked with a smattering of tee shirts, vintage clothing and several faux retro cookbooks. 

On one side of building is a non-operative supposedly soon-to-open soda fountain. . .or so we were told, even though other reviewers have raved about it. On other side  is a bar where we unsuccessfully attempted to order iced tea (probably only place in Phoenix that doesn't serve it) and got dirty look from surly young bartender in the process.

Appeared to be some sort of dining area in open storage yard/garage  to the rear but at this point, who cared? A very bizarre, over-hyped establishment attempting  to fill a merchandising niche that probably doesn't even exist."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday morning with a friend who hadn't been there before, it was just opening and everyone was very welcoming and friendly.  I am an oatmeal maven and I can rate theirs very highly, delicious! The pecan french toast was scrumptious.   also great coffee served in real diner cups.  It's really fun to walk around and see the merchandise.  The bartender Cat and the server Brandon were especially nice.  This would be a good place for an informal party."}
{"text":"Amazing!  My husband and I visited today and has definitely become a place we will take visiting friends from out of town. Also a great place to hang before D-Back games. Thank you Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Never knew a boxing ring, dance floor, ice cream shop, clothing shop, and restaurant could all be in one bar! 

I was even more pleased to see a Moscow Mule on the drink menu. It only ran me about 7$, but I didn't mind paying it as it came in a MASON JAR - love!! 

Hula Hoops were accessible as a unique dance accessory :)"}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to its hype!!! Although there was LONG wait for the food, it was worth it. I had the mac and cheese muffins and a strawberry lemonade a d my stomach was as happy as a clam. The place was very crowded but there is lots of space inside that most people were not using. We had never been there a d it was hard for us to find the entrance, once we did, we came in and no one greeted us, we sat looming for staff for about 10 min and as we were about to leave we decided to walk around and we stumbled on the court yard and the ordering hub. It was a weird set up and it seemed like although it's a tourist attraction their system of ordering was very confusing. ...but all was forgiven once we tested the food."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a Saturday night at 6:30. I was reluctant to come here because I thought it would be too hot inside-it was over 100 outside and the restaurant isn't air conditioned. 

There was no need to worry. We sat outside in the courtyard and it was very comfortable, 20 degrees cooler than the street. Inside was also comfortable-we never felt hot at all.  Even when we left around 7:45 it wasn't overly crowded or loud. All in all it's a great, fun atmosphere for families. After eating, my son and I played ping pong and bean bag toss. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful, and very welcoming. An A+ for the staff. 

We ordered a chicken pot pie, mac and cheese muffins, and a Duce Salad. All were excellent, unique without being weird. The mac and cheese muffins were the star-the perfect combination of gooey cheese, soft macaroni, and toasted, buttery crumbs."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! Dancing and music were pretty fun. We must have caught them on a bad night because the food (sliders and chips) was really greasy and service was super slow. Place was busy but not packed. Bar was quick and efficient but food service needs help!"}
{"text":"Confused is the way I can describe this place; more confused and inching it's way to befuddled. 

To start off with good: there are plenty of games and it is very very open. You won't be crowded end to end like a typical. Scottsdale bar. Their custom mixed drinks are good, even if a little on the sweet side. 

The bad: it is insanely hot in the summer, as it is in an old warehouse in a seedy neighborhood with no ac. Parking can be weird as the gated parking lots are not used to for parking in this place. Food is lack luster (cold pies Served in jars and beyond greasy Mac and cheese bites), not able to order mixed drinks and food at same time, and for some reason there is a vintage store inside. 

To be honest, this place has always been a little \"meh\" in my mind. I have wound up here a few times over the years, but the negatives always annoy to the point I out weight positives. Even though featured on triple d, the food is lack luster and lacking a real identity. Not quiet american, not quite BBQ, not quite diner......just all over the place. There is also a gym, vintage store, and two bars.....all in all the theme seems to be somewhere between disjointed and a Pinterest girls exploded dream. 

Not a bad place to change up the scene if you are local, but not a place to make a priority if you are visiting or new to phx."}
{"text":"Fun vintage little hotspot. Parking is very limited and the drinks are way overpriced. About $10-$14 if you get one of there specially made drinks. 
I do love this place for dancing though! It's right between the feel of a club and a bar. They play old school through current hits! I first found this place and now my friends have fallen in love with it as well."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and was underwhelmed. The brisket sliders are very tasty, but everything is a la carte, so expensive. For that, two chicken brats, and macncheese muffins  (oh yeah and the sip of diet coke- they serve it in vintage 8 Oz bottles), it was $36.  I can see why the place was nearly empty.  I would suggest putting green chilies in the macncheese muffins, for addl flavor, and creating some $15 combos. And, for God's sake, get a soda fountain! That alone would garner one more star."}
{"text":"Went for a girl friend's bachelorette party. Interesting place to say the least. So much going on, boxing, ping pong, hula hooping, and of course, dancing and food. Verrrryyy hipster crowd, which is good or bad, depending on your style. 

Food: 50's style picnic area/diner. I had the chicken sausage sliders which were delicious! Yummy lemonade and other drinks served in mason jars. 

Music: DJ was okay, could have cut short some songs people didn't seem interested in and kept playing more popular ones. Overall, had a good time, definitely a unique place in the valley."}
{"text":"The Duce is a disaster. 
As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. 
However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this place the first time I went due to the customer service. Its very different, you walk in and seat yourself. It's such a beautiful place with vintage decor and amazing american food. There sliders were killer. The drinks were so good too! Slightly on the higher price but worth it. My first experience was a thursday about a month ago and I was bummed because I felt like the \"server\" seemed uninterested with helping us and not thrilled to be at her job. But the second time in, last Wednesday was a completely different story. The server or trailer girl/hostess was fantastic. Has an amazing personality perfect for the job. She greeted us with smiles and laughter. Made us feel extremely comfortable and new a lot about the place. We sat on the patio because it was nice out and began chatting with her like we were old time friends. It seemed like every customer or group that came in had the same experience, our table would actually envy the other tables if she spent to much time with them. She engaged customers to chat with one another too. She gave so much info about the place we told our friends to join the gym! I say find out when she's working before heading in! she'll make the difference for ya!! Great place, have to take in relative or out of towners and maybe get back into the fitness game. You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Wow this place dropped a deuce on my company's Christmas party. We tried multiple times to make a reservation with no one calling us back. We go any way and they run out of all food???? On a Sunday during Holiday times?? Ouch that's a horrible look! Not to mention after they tell us what we ordered we can't have, they \"gave\" us sliders that were left over from another group?! This is the first time I've ever been here but no need to come back. Pretty damn pathetic."}
{"text":"Stopped in here once just to check it out. I asked the bar tender if he had anything on special. Immediately  he told me to \"Get a job\". Then he said he can understand some locals coming in and wanting cheap drinks but not someone with an ASU hat and an American Eagle shirt. I apologized to the guy because I didn't mean to come across as being cheap. Blew it off and he got me a drink.

Other than that one incident, the place looks pretty fun. Perhaps I just had a stressed out bar tender. However, it's not okay to treat friendly customers that way. I don't plan on going back or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The drinks are AMAZING! Everything is fresh and hand squeezed in front of you. Only downfall is it is a little pricey. Huge building with a boxing ring and different things to see in every corner. 
Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here after the Critical Mass bike ride last night.  We had so much fun!  It was a great night to sit on the patio.  There was 80s karaoke.  I've only eaten breakfast here, so it was good to check out the other offerings.  My friends got a salad that looked fantastic.  Another friend got the biscuit sliders, and said they were yummy.  I wasn't hungry, but I did sample the homemade chips, both regular potato and sweet potato.  Both were delicious, but I thought the sweet potato chips had a more complex, interesting flavor.  We drank too many mojitos and mingled with our fellow bicyclists into the night.  The venue was very accommodating, and had set aside an area for us to lock up our bikes.  Fun!  Oh, and news flash!  The Duce will soon carry Rock Springs famous pies!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful place, great ambience, even better food and it oozes style. Try the sliders and a well crafted cocktail with all organic ingredients. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not an awesome experience. We ordered our food and then ordered drinks. We were told food would be about 25 minutes because we got the pancake. Drinks took about 15 minutes. Our food took 54. The pancake was hot, but the rest was lukewarm. Not impressed and the kitchen didn't care. The cherry on top was when we were ready to leave. Valet told us someone backed into our car. She left a nice scratch on the front. They did get the lady's insurance information for us, but now we get to deal with that, too. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cool place to stop in and check out. Grab a beer and relax. However it took over a hour for cheeseburger sliders... Seems way to long to wait! Hope they get the kitchen speed faster, otherwise it's a good place"}
{"text":"Everyone knows rooster fighting is illegal and usually breaks up early on Sunday morning. Last week having lost my shirt at the fights, I was topless and hungry wandering around South Phoenix and found The Duce. 

The place had everything Companion and I needed. First, being shirtless, there is a clothes store.  I purchased matching vintage gray sweatshirt from my Alma Mater, \"Tech\". Second, alcohol. Waiting patiently until the clock struck \"10\" and the bar opened, I ordered two spicy Bloody Marys, which did not disappoint. 

What DID disappoint was the celery stick which was the size of a Louisville Slugger. I should know, because it felt like a baseball bat when Companion whacked me across the head with hers because I said she DID look fat in the sweatshirt. 

Finally, nourishment. The egg/bacon/cheese sliders were a good choice for reconciliation between Companion and I, especially on the sunny patio. The sun did not shine for long, though, because to make a long story short, her second Bloody Mary ended up forcibly on my new sweatshirt, leaving me alone at The Duce. Not a bad place to be!"}
{"text":"Parking is awfull. Small lot gets overloaded. I parked on a side driveway. I asked the worker if it was OK. He said yes -- there are no signs. I end up with a $50 ticket! 

Food is very good. 
No air conditioning!! 
Fast food type dining. Order at a window or the bar. Pick up your food when ready. Play some games while you wait. Its hard to hear your name called. 
Seat yourself anywhere."}
{"text":"This place gets four stars because of the atmosphere and the food. The atmosphere is unlike anything else in Phoenix with picnic tables, mason jars, hula hoops, and a good DJ on the weekend. Don't be in a hurry here though, as all the employees seem to take their time to get anything done, regardless of how busy it is."}
{"text":"We went one Friday night, it was kinda dead... They had karaoke. The music was a bit too loud for the ratio of people that were there. It was way too hot even with the \"big ass fan\" on full blast. I know Phoenix had the hottest August this year. Installing misters would help to cool the place. The old fashion cocktails was yummy! I had the grasshopper, it was like eating a chocolate mint patty. Hmmmm....mint patty....The Duce is a fusion venue. There were clothing and bags for sale. Ice cream and juice bar. Boxing ring and punching bag. LOL Get drunk then go take the frustration out on the punching bag. LOL I thought the place was really cool except for the temperature. It definitely needs more promotion and marketing to bring the place to life."}
{"text":"I emailed the Duce to make a reservation for my roommates birthday on a Tuesday night for 7 people at 8:00 pm and they emailed me back saying no reservation was needed. We get there around 8 and the only parking is a block or two away; pretty sketchy for 7, 18+ girls to be walking around downtown phx at night. We walk in and are asked if we are there for the dancing lessons and when we said we were just there for dinner the lady was very rude and gestured us with a sigh to the dinning area.. okay? We start ordering and someone asks to see one of our ID's. Apparently after 9:00 pm it is 21+. Awesome, we have one hour to hangout eat some sliders and play some corn hole. For the record it doesn't say anywhere on their website it turns into 21+ and the kind man who emailed me back also failed to mention. Now it's 8:30 and we have all finished quickly chowing down our sliders and ($8 small milkshakes!) we head over to the games and at about 8:45 the staff is hovering over us waiting to kick us out. We were already done in the dinning area just hanging out by the games and at 9:00 sharp we were asked to leave. There was maybe 10-15 people in the whole joint so it's not like it was a poppin place where we could sneak some alcohol we literally just wanted to hangout and enjoy my friends 19th birthday. Won't be back again because they obviously don't care about their under 21 crowd! :)"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week for a company holiday party. We were only on the patio, and a large group, so keep that in mind as you read. I was pleasantly surprised - The atmosphere was awesome. The DJ played a great variety of songs - from the Beatles to Bruno Mars, which suited our group and made it fun for everyone. They staff was all very friendly and helpful. They have a nice selection of seemingly original cocktails - all made fresh right in front of you, and a big selection of beers that seem rare to find.  My favorite thing was the multiple ping pong and corn hole games set up around the place. You feel like your at someone's backyard party, but no one had to do any work to cook or make drinks!"}
{"text":"Visited The Duce before the ASU/WVU bowl game in downtown PHX. Very cool set-up and atmosphere but the service was severely lacking. I understand these are specialty cocktails & they're not twisting a cap off a bottle and handing it to you.. but the bar was under-staffed and in a pissed off mood, as were the patrons. Food was decent but did not make up for the drink service, we left after one round."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here since no one else wanted to, just snooped around for a minute and was crushin' on Anna.. I'm gonna go ahead and assume the food is exceptional..."}
{"text":"Amazing place to meet up with friends or date. Good music or karaoke, and where else can you play ping pong and foosball next to a boxing ring and 50s diner."}
{"text":"Glad we checked this place out whike in Pheonix. Saw quite a while back on Diners Drive Ins and Dives and wanted to see it in person. Fun atmosphere. We played some oversized Connect four after ordering our Bacon MacnCheese muffins. Service was fast and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"23 year old asu student. Always been one of my favorite places in phoenix. I brought my out of town family here and they were treated to an unbelievable night of drinking and fun. The OWNER treated my mother some FREE boxing lessons!!!  Could not have asked for a better night!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went on a The Duce website to request information about holding my wedding reception at their venue.  I received a quick response from Steve Rosenstein on 12/4/16 asking for me to provide a few more details which I did the same day.  Since then, I've received no response about my inquiry.   Poor customer service.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible selection. We went with a group of about 16 people. We had tried several times over the course of about a month to make a reservation and we never received any follow up or feedback. We should have taken that as a big red flag. The parking was terrible. We had to walk several blocks half of which were unlit. When we arrived it became apparent that there was a big corporate event taking place. This group only took up a small portion of the floor space. They should have closed their doors to the general public. Every food item we tried to order was sold out. We ended up having to order 16 Sheppard's pies. When they arrived they were all cold. When we asked if they could be heated up we were told that they didn't have a way to do that. You can't serve us a hot dish any other way than room temperature? The ambiance was kitschy and tacky with a \"gift shop\" selling more kitsch. Apparently the boxing ring they have there is used by some private fitness group. I'm sure it's very hygienic to have people sweating and fighting in close proximity to where food is being served. The cocktails are really good but pretty overpriced considering we had to go get them ourselves and wait in line at a tiny bar. Usually I will give a place a second chance but I have no inclination to do that with this place."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to be! First time here and had a blast! Loved how the place was designed vintage and there was a variety of music. Had the cheeseburger sliders and a spiked root beer float... DELICIOUS! My friend and I do a lot of social dancing and were looking for a new place to dance... I think this will be a new hang out for us! Definitely going to recommend this place to friends :)"}
{"text":"First time there today after seeing  a year prior Guy F. Triple D
Order the mac &cheeses bisquits they were delicious, yet took nearly 30 minutes to get. Cool setting but the eatery having a \" Pit bull Adoption \" not cool. Disappointed at the establishment for allowing animals and food to be combined."}
{"text":"The Duce has a nice atmosphere, a great menu, good drinks, and reasonable prices.  It is never dull, and usually good fun.  They have put a great deal of thought into the details to make it a cut above the usual warehouse-turned-bar.  They have exercise equipment, clothes for sale, and frequent events.  I am absolutely impressed that these things can coexist in a bar, where it only takes one guy saying \"hey, look at this\" to ruin a great deal of stuff.  It is well managed in that regard, and unfailingly friendly.

The people who show up are usually interesting, and I have met fun people just chatting with others.  It is a large place, but the space is divided into nicely-sized areas.  It was not too crowded nor too empty.

That said, they miss on a few points which is why I rate it with three stars.  They have separate counters for drinks, food, and milkshakes.  This means you will spend a good deal of time waiting in line. Ordering food, they ask you for (and insist upon) a silly name, which then they announce using a badly distorted loudspeaker which is approximately half the volume of their music.  I had half a mind to give them a horribly offensive name, just to have them announce it; this sort of forced cuteness is rather annoying (it is probably done because there are bound to be many people named \"Emily\" or \"Jeff\" at the bar, but there are better ways to get around this). The food is good, but unless you happen to be seated right next to the food cart, it will be cold by the time you realize your \"name\" was called. 

The music was somewhat mysterious--they had a band and DJ going, sometimes simultaneously and loudly.  It is not a quiet place, but competing sound systems does not help; it merely makes noise.

Nevertheless, I will probably go back again (I have been several times before).  It is a good bar and with a little work, could be a great bar. I have only been there in the evening, but they seem to have a good breakfast menu.  It would be interesting to visit at those times, I think."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Love the charm. Lots of stuff to do without being a hassle. To compare it to The Yard which is similar in concept, there's much more to do and it's much easier to gain access to it. Foosball, boxing ring, hula hoops, dancing, bean bags. It's like the party I would want to host myself.

Atmosphere is charming; they were playing 90s pop and hip-hop, fun classic group dancing songs, the lighting was nice.

A food menu! I love to snack while out. I'll have to try their brunch menu too.

Giant mason jar drinks were very refreshing. I can't speak to the strength as I was sweating so much-- which leads me to...

Cons:
It was SO HOT. I learned about the no A/C deal the hard way.I drank quite a bit, but felt nothing at the end of the night, probably because I was sweating it all out.

Tight parking-- I don't mind valet parking but I understand some people prefer not. It is not very well lit around the block, either, so finding nearby parking may be a bit risky.

I can't wait to come back at the end of September when it's not hot anymore!"}
{"text":"We threw our wedding here, and it was amazing!  We worked with Keeley, the events coordinator, who went above and beyond.  She made it very easy to coordinate with our vendors, and we were impressed that she remembered all of the details that we discussed to help make everything run smoothly and stress-free on our wedding day.  The level of person attention that Keeley gave throughout the entire year of planning was more than we could have asked for.  Our guests raved about how fantastic the cocktails were, and everyone loved how warm and unique the space was, and how elegant it looked for the event.   

One of the reasons that we chose the Duce was for their delicious food and cocktail menu, and they did not disappoint with the quality.  The bartenders went out of their way to give amazing service, and really added to the atmosphere.  We chose Brandon, who is the house DJ, who did a great job as the MC, and kept the party going.  

Overall, we can't thank the Duce enough for making our wedding day so special!"}
{"text":"I went to the Duce last night with a friend. The food was great, the drinks were great as was the atmosphere.  I had a hard time with the lack of air conditioning and not enough fans. This place would be amazing and would get 5 stars  if it were cooler inside. I will return in November ( or later)to try more food  choices for sure. The bruschetta, was my favorite but the salad and pulled chicken sliders were all really well made."}
{"text":"After living in Phoenix for almost a year, I finally got around to visiting The Duce. This place is great! It's like a tiny village of funtimes. Not only do they serve food and drinks, there is also a boxing ring in the middle of the place. Need to buy some new clothes? Shit they've got that too. I could probably live in this place. Food-wise: I tried the mac & cheese muffins and some hand-squeezed lemonade. Both were delicious. I'd like to go back and try some of their cocktails and brunch. Go here."}
{"text":"The Duce is the Urban Outfitters of the Phoenix Bar Scene. That being said, it's still a great bar! They play pretty awesome music, and have three(ish) areas to socialize. I'm a huge fan of this place when the weather is nice. Try their milkshakes and appetizers."}
{"text":"I visited The Duce a second time to watch the Suns game last night, and I was super happy with everything they did. Food and drink specials, the game in HD in the food area outside, a friendly chick bringing out drinks from the bar. I appreciated that even though there were a lot of kids there they had a place to watch the game inside. They even improved the food, they grill the chicken and ribs on site now instead of just roasting them, I got the maple glazed chicken and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This is a wonder land for your senses.  It is what I call a hipster cracker barrel.  Lots of spaces, free valet, interesting shop, delicious food, lots of space. It is a wonderful place for a drink, bite, boxing, taking your kids. It is nice to have to be so crowded, the crowd is diverse and let's you into a it of kitschy Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok I m giving this three stars because the meatball slider really needs help. Tough meatball n bland. The short.rib sliders very good, brisket sliders.also good but could have had more brisket.  The ribs we were.split on 2 people said not fall off the bone and tasted weird, the other 2 were.ok. The service was great even know we were the only ones in the joint we had a great conversation about food. Bartender also great they made the meal fun since we r visiting from NY. I would go back when it is perhaps a tad cooler out."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese balls. Enough said. Great atmosphere with nice outdoor seating. Also burgers are great."}
{"text":"Where else can you grab some BBQ, have a drink freshly made and put your friend in a camel clutch in a full-sized wrestling ring?

I was in there on Sat and watched the bartender press ~2 fresh grapefruit into my greyhound (served in a mason jar).  I'm not a huge fan of grapefruit because they remind me of old people but this was damn good.  They understand the importance of quality.  

The music is also phenomenal:  Otis, Marvin, Stevie, Aretha...all the hits.   

I wish this place had a better location because it's missing a crowd.  I would have thought the hipsters on 5th would be all over this place on a Saturday night.  Bring the crowd and I'll give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place can be a lot of fun, but it also can be LOUD which is really grating! Don't sit at the big table right by the bar as you won't be able to hear your friends. The other areas of the Duce are still loud, but not as bad. Also they should stop YELLING in the PA system when someone's food is ready. Seriously it put our whole party on edge. 

Other than that, it's a fun place to go to eat, hang out, and hula hoop! Seriously the addition of the corn hole game and a hula hoop had us cracking up all night! Good call Duce! Add some alcohol and you've got a party. 

I've also been to a wedding here and it was lovely. They just put up a white curtain blocking the store area, and the guests sat in the section of bleachers. It was SO CUTE and we loved it. 

They should add a couple pool tables, I think that would be fun. 

Overall this place is like... A honky-tonk minus the country music for hipsters."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what The Duce is -- a bar, a restaurant, a gift shop, a bakery, an entertainment complex?

When I learned of The Duce and checked out their website, it seemed like an eclectic place with lots of character. What we experienced was a place that doesn't quite know which way to go or what to focus on (and forcing a hipster vibe), and because of that, nothing was as good as it could be with such a great warehouse space.

We went for lunch on a Saturday and sat outside. Of course, just figuring out where to go to eat once at the front door took a few minutes. We ordered at the counter and sat ourselves. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. We waited over 30 minutes for some melted cheese sliders and mac-n-cheese muffins, which I might add were meant to be a starter and came out after my husband was done with his main meal. Yes, not only did we wait over 30 minutes, but they brought out my husband's meal 10 minutes before mine and the appetizer. The only thing they offered to compensate was a free Coke. Wow...thanks.

The food was okay. Certainly not worth the wait or the cost ($10 for three little grilled cheese sliders and no side). And I'm still not sure why we waited so long, because it was not busy. 

Overall, we were very disappointed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday 8/6 and boy was it BUSY! What a crazy experience. This place is HUGE and there is something to do for everyone! I came with a large group of friends and we were able to split off and do our own things. Ping Pong anyone? And I don't have to sacrifice my ID for a ping pong paddle! (I'm looking at you, Culinary Dropout)

They had beef brisket sandwiches which were to die for. There was a long line, but I met some fun people so I guess it wasn't so bad. I didn't know what drink to order, so the bartender made me and my friend a GIANT margarita. It was incredible. My other friends were super jel. The bar was so busy, I don't know how 2 people managed that. Luckily I found there were two other bars in the place! Crazy, crazy place. 

I will be back here for sure! I want to get in that boxing ring!"}
{"text":"Different food several kinds of sliders, but everything was great tasting. I had short rib and the pulled chicken in a lunch special it came with a couple of their Mac n cheese muffins which were excellent. Although there are ping pong and bag toss areas needs a couple of big TV's to show ESPN or sports on..."}
{"text":"I liked the space, though I am sure it will be more enjoyable when it's not so hot. Mac and cheese muffins were greasy and flavorless, not worth the $9, for sure. Food orders took a long time. The strawberry bruschetta was much better, but that seems like a hard thing to screw up. Good music early in the evening, mostly Motown, that was a mixed bag as the night went on. (Outkast, yes please, country music, not such a fan.)  I would go again, my friends and I had fun."}
{"text":"Awesome bar with great ambiance, drinks, and food! Anytime I have my Chicago friends visiting I make sure to take them here! I finally tried the food yesterday and it was amazing! The Duce spiked lemonade, sliders, and cheese dip are my faves! A little pricey but so worth it!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite joints I've been to. Great menu. Great venue. Awesome time. Jake and Sarah were really great bartenders. The rest of the staff was friendly and helpful.The funny nicknames to pick up your food was a nice twist. It's a great place to hang with friends and chill. The games were fun too. We really enjoyed our time at The Duce and I can't say enough good things about it. Thanks Phoenix for allowing us to experience this gem!"}
{"text":"Based off of the reviews, I was a bit hesitant to visit, but I am beyond happy I did.

My friends and I were looking for a karaoke place to go to, but had trouble due to the fact that we aren't 21 yet. Luckily, I came across The Duce and gave them a call to see if we could still get in and they just said we couldn't buy alcohol. I was down. 

Though the location was a tad sketchy, parking was great and we had no problem getting in. Immediately when we got there, we were greeted by some loud throwback Backstreet Boys and friendly staff. We were overwhelmed by how many awesome things they had going on (clothing store, milkshake bar, ping pong tables, bars, bars, bars, fully functioning kitchen, boxing ring, etc), but what attracted us the most was the dance floor. Though we expected karaoke, we were totally down for some dancing (karaoke is more of a Thursday night thing, apparently).

After a few songs, we settled at one of their rad tables and ate some rad mac n cheese muffins, cronuts, and melted cheese sliders. It's a little on the pricy side, but so worth it. What's also great is that they had some tanks of water right next to the dance floor with some nicely-sized cups that we could pour for ourselves.

Everyone they're was super chill and had a pretty wide range of age. Also, it's half outdoors, half indoors with massive ceiling fans, so I wasn't even that hot (unless I was hardcore busting a move). I'm going back all of the time because of how dope it was!"}
{"text":"Entrance was confusing but when we went it was in the back (entrance sign was pointed opposite of entrance). We arrived at 4:45 on a Friday before the Dbacks game. Great outdoor seating on a nice weather and great things to do inside. We took our kids and they enjoyed the corn hole and boxing bag. 
We tried the orange bloom beer $6.50 and it was light and pretty good. Wish we had enough $ to try other drinks. We bought the beef brisket, sampler plate w brisket/chicken sausage/meatball, Mac muffins & the bacon Mac muffins. $55 total and had water available at the counter. Great atmosphere especially with a group! Food was tasty, Brisket is a must have n Mac muffins for sure. See my pics."}
{"text":"Fantastic Drinks - I had several Brown Derby drinks - served in an awesome Mason Jar. They made it with fresh ingredients right in front of me - and that includes squeezing two Grapefruits into the Mason Jar for fresh grapefruit juice. Great sliders as well."}
{"text":"Came form Cali and let me tell u this place is like home! And Courtney girl crush and eyebrows on point but definitely a place I'll visit again. Thank you Courtney for your amazing service and drinks"}
{"text":"I love this place and I live in Seattle and always stop by when I'm in AZ. Cool place to see the game and have the best food out there."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed any other time there, although it's been on busy weekends... Tonight was a different experience. An event I was part of... Has been booked way of time, talked about, confirmed for tonight. Everything going smooth, drinks and food bring bought, people showing up, etc. An hour into our event we're asked to end the event. From the moment there I felt uncomfortable with the staff, other than Rachel, she was awesome & the only one who truly did get job with a smile. The whole set up we were being accommodated just fine, if there was a problem this should and could have been resolved. It hurt my feeling; because this was a heart felt occasion for alot of people. For whatever the reason, whoever would make a decision like that, is just sad."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hangout with friends. I recommend the cranberry cobbler cocktail"}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. It feels like they are trying way too hard to be cool or hipster. That said, everyone else I meet loves it."}
{"text":"The most interesting places I've ever visited in Phoenix!! All I will say is you need to see it for yourself! Fun Fun Fun!!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was pretty cool and decided to check it out on my birthday. I was so disappointed. I wasn't disappointed by the drinks or food, but the DJ was just RUDE! It was a saturday night and there was no one there and the DJ guy was a total dick to all my friends. All my friends wanted to do was sing karoke since that was the only thing they could do. I asked the DJ when it was my friends turn to sing, and he was like when its her turn! (Not even in a nice way). Granted maybe he was having a bad day, but dont take it out on us. My friend and I went up to talk to the manager and he wasn't that much of a help either. He told me he didn't own the place! Well I would figure that! We were just letting you know our concerns to make this place better, because it does have potential to be AWESOME, but a staff like that, it most def put a sour taste in my mouth. We ended up going to BARSMITH afterwards, and enjoyed by birthday there instead!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of months ago and the bartender was very friendly but the drinks were expensive. Its a good place to go to on a night out for dancing but expect to spend about 15$ for a drink."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an upbeat spot with a great atmosphere and a stellar drink menu, this is the place to choose. A few friends of mine and I stumbled upon this place. There was corn hole, a dance floor, plenty of seating, great social scene, and decent music. Drinks were decently priced and very tasty! We stayed for about two hours and left very happy. The mason jars and hula hoops were a nice added touch."}
{"text":"First have to start with the parking sucks. \"Free\" valet parking.... yeah sure. Itty bitty lot where cars are jammed together. So don't take your Lexus or corvette. 
It's interesting on the inside but you get by that pretty quick. The food? Please, don't bother. Greasy and cold. Yes, went for a party and the hors d'oeuvres were nasty. Cold and stiff. Just like my first ex-wife. The main course... what a joke. The mashed potatoes and corn came out 40 minutes before the sliders. Mashed potatoes leaking greasy butter or margarine on the top. Needless to say that by the time everything was out... it was as cold and nasty. 
Suffice to say I held off 24 hours before writing this review. After my fourth friend called and told me about the day spent in the bathroom I figured warning was in order. 
I did give this place one star simply because I could not give it zero stars. I tried. Oh, the do have entertainment and the D.J. was among the worst I have seen in years...."}
{"text":"The coolest place to go for wonderful creative and fun fare, killer drinks, music, a piece of chicago, people, GAMES, hula hoop, boutique shopping, milk shakes, swing dancing, wobble dancing, jarred deserts, airstream trailers, group workouts, and boxing!!

Yeah, thats right - this place has all of that and all wrapped up in a trendy - hipster, urban, neighborhood joint.  Love everything about  The Duce."}
{"text":"I love the Duce! The drinks are super expensive, which is a bummer, but the atmosphere is great and they have something different going on every night. This is a great place to go with a large group. Wednesday nights are throwback nights--cheap cheap beers!"}
{"text":"This place is super. But VEGETARIANS beware:  there is gelatin & animal based protein ingredients in most items, including the desserts, like the cheesecake :/"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS drinks! everything is super fresh. great food also. i recommend the meat ball sliders. wash it down with a greyhound while you're at it...just don't leave you beverage on the windowsill in the dining area. it opens up to an alley and bums WILL steal your drink. no joke. i watched a bum steal my friends drink. aside from the area the duce is at...it's a pretty awesome place. i'll be back.

..and as for the bums?i will be watching...oh yes, i will be watching."}
{"text":"I think the idea of the place and the games and overall atmosphere are a great idea.
The old lady that was serving in the back bar was a miserable person and very very rude!
The drinks are not cheap which is fine as its all organic fruit, but when I request a meddled drink smash the fruit like your supposed to...."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Food was great, i cant choose a favorite from the sampler platter.  The mac and cheese muffins are a must have."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service. I waited at the bar of 8 people for at least 5 minutes, then decided to create a Yelp account just to leave a poor review. Had some sign up issues but as of this moment I've written this review and still no sign of a drink. Seems the bartender is enjoying flirting with a girl at the end of the bar. Love the place but this service is the absolute worst"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place! It's perfect for a big group of people or even just our family of five. It's really fun, the food is wonderful and the drinks are delish!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for awhile and thought the pics looked really amazing. I didn't understand why no one had ever suggested going here. Now I know why.

It kills me that the atmosphere is listed as \"hipster\" and multiple reviewers described it as such. This is one of the least hipster places I've ever been. I would describe the atmosphere as \"trailer park chic\". Although the chic part is a little bit of a stretch. 

This place doesn't work for me, but I give them credit for trying hard. It has a universal studios /cracker barrel type vibe to it, with lots of shabby chic elements mixed in, but it's too much -  there is random stuff and signs/writing everywhere... and feels very overwhelming and is sensory overload. 

We came in the afternoon and had a few drinks and lunch. They were blaring oldies and the average customer was 65, and that includes kids skewing the average. Clearly there is nothing wrong with being in your sixties/seventies or children, but it's not exactly hipster. 

Valet at 12 in the afternoon in an empty parking lot when it would have been easier to  park ourselves just 5 ft away...that always adds to the annoyance. 

I had the chicken sausage and pickle slaw and I did not care for them. Sausage was dry and slaw tasted like it had 2 cups of sugar in it. What's good: my boyfriend had the sliders and they were awesome and they have an extensive list of creative cocktails and both the old fashioned and margarita were excellent.  Service was good - everyone was very nice. 

I would describe it as a family friendly spot with an interesting/novel atmosphere. Food is southern/home cooking/heavy.

Boxing ring in The middle and cornhole (aka bags) which is cool, but I couldn't stand to hear the music for more than 30 mins to stick around. I was disappointed because of the area and pictures gave me hope, but NOT my scene. I'm giving it 3 stars because it may be great for some people but not for me."}
{"text":"I see the attraction in cooler months. Loved the vintage industrial feel. It's a feast for your eyes.  I will be back & I'm hoping have a 5 star review. This time just a 3. 
My hubs ordered the mac n cheese bites but I gotta say for the caloric intake not impressed at all. Shame on you Guy from DDD. You steered me wrong again. We also had a couple of the organic cocktails & LOVED them both. Not the price but hey you get what you pay for right & they were refreshing. The bartender was knowledgable & funny. They also had some Chicago beers that were cost effective if on a budget that I know would go excellent with the Chicago Dog we had. So stay tuned for the Fall review."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place! As a foodie who likes to try new places, I always keep an open mind going in.
We went on a Wed night after work.We were never greeted by anyone. I finally got up to ask someone who I thought worked there. You can't tell because everyone that does looks like they just crawled out of bed! I was told that all orders are taken at the bar.So we head to the bar to order a drink and food.We placed order for the fod and waited for 10 minutes for a beer. The one and only person behind the bar was busy mixing two cocktails and had one speed, verrrrrry sllloooow. The only thing he had going for him was his looks.I continue... No one tells us that are food isn't going to be delivered to us from the diner /camper /car in the back. So it sat there for a while and finally someone came and asked if we ordered food, that it was \"over there\". Again, Are you kidding me? Two of us had meatballs sliders, OK tasting, but cold. One of us had the ribs. OMG, 5 ribs , nothing else came with them, mediocre at best and $14.00! Again, are you kidding me? No one asked us how anything was, picked up plates, nothing! We had no idea if we were to clean up after ourselves or what. We just left everything sitting there , in the rain outside. As far as leaving a tip..to who? and for what? Are you kidding me?
I watched the video from the owners on their website. They say they are going for some kind of gritty , Chicago feel. Well I'm from the midwest and have been to Chicago many many times over the years and I can honestly say I have never been in place like this there or anywhere in the miswest! #1 in the midwest , service is key, here , not so much. 
If your are looking for grungy, no service, uncomfortable go ...if not , stay home, or go somewhere else. If I could have given this place a -10 stars I would have. You have been warned!
On a side not: I always wonder if the Owners read the reviews? I would love to hear a response if so......."}
{"text":"The best place I have ever been to ever.

I was walking by, then I saw a boxing area which I thought \"how random and cool !!\", then when I peaked inside and saw some random t-shirts, old soda's, a classic food truck, old movies playing,,, and all put together in a great way.

I tried their jack daniels pecan pie, with a cup of coffee,,, the best thing that I have ever had,,, it's a to die for."}
{"text":"What a damn good time!! Lots and lots of dancing with ransoms, loud music, hula hoops, games, maybe food ... can't quite remember!! We started out pregaming at a friend's house, then hit a party bus and ended the night with the Duce!! 


I wish I could give you more in this review, but I had such a good drunk time that I can't remember much besides the good drinks and good dancing with random people. I hope the pics illustrate exactly what I'm saying .., see you next time at the Duce!!"}
{"text":"I had such a good experience here. This place is perfect for a large group that needs to pay separately. They have indoor and outdoor space for seating. It's super eclectic! My group ordered the spinach mac n cheese muffins, the breakfast sliders, the brisket Reuben sliders and the ribs with corn. The sliders were actually pretty large and came with 3. The bread for the Reuben sliders was really soft. The breakfast sliders used cheddar biscuits. The ribs fell off the bone. For drinks at the bar on Saturdays, they have a bar with fresh ingredients. We ordered a black and blue mojito, a regular mojito, a grapefruit schlimm, whiskey sours and mimosas. All had fresh juice incorporated. It was fun to watch our bartender make them!! Very nice staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diner, Drive-In and Dives. So a bunch of us went there for lunch. It's funky alright but not as cool as I thought. WAY over priced food, $3.50 for 8 oz bottle of diet coke. The slider sampler platter was $12 no frys or chips... The Mac  and cheese muffins were over cooked and dry. Service, well... You order your food and pick it up yourself, our parties food were ordered at the same time but there was a 15 minute lag time between orders. Being completed, unacceptable. I was embarrassed for suggesting this place, there is no air condition and being in a warehouse it was just too hot."}
{"text":"CONS: over-priced food, greasy food, cockroaches , too loud
PROS: Unique atmosphere
I tried this place out last night. A friend and I had been meaning to catch up...and yikez, this was not the place to do it. It was very very loud. I think it was karaoke night or something because people were volunteering to sing horrible songs in horrible voices. It was TOO NOISY (considering only 15 people were there) and very hard to make conversation. 
I ordered the chicken pot pie which was delicious. I would get it again next time I go, which will probably be never.
My friend ordered the melted cheese sandwich which she said was just okay. 
We shared the mac and cheese muffins which were horrible! They were luke warm, flavor and saltless, basically tasteless, and kinda made me nauseous after. We only ate a couple and left 1/2 of them for the roaches. 
I feel like i'm wasing my time writing this review. Basically. DO NOT GO FOR THE FOOD, check it our for the atmosphere...probably a fun place to show up drunk to."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great drinks and sliders. The ambience is laid back and fun. They have 3 or 4 different bars and ping pong tables, a boxing ring and a cool nostalgic boutique. It was fun to see everyone having a good time seeing karaoke. Even I had to get in on the fun and Sing-a-Song. Come and check this place out it's fun and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Hannah, one of the Duce's team members.  Great conversation and a truly enjoyable atmosphere made me a believer.  I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie, mac/cheese muffins and a jar of cider. Great atmo... more \"old skool\" than \"hipster\". Wish I was from Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It depends on when you go. During the week awesome, fun. Great place for groups period I went on a double date and it was a zoo. The staff was not very helpful. We couldn't find a table period want to relax went with the flow, it was fine. Not as much as a weekday outing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor, yet needs a lot of improvement on service. My party waited for over an hour for our food. 

People standing around the kitchen complaining about slow service!"}
{"text":"The Duce was a fun, happening spot. The DJ was excellent and really had the whole place going. Delicious drinks and great service! I wish our party stayed their all night because I had a blast!"}
{"text":"My friends and I all love going to The Duce! They have great cocktails (although a bit expensive for college students) and they have never charged a cover when we go. We always have a great time and it never gets ridiculously crowded like some bars. The one issue I have with the place is their lack of music variety. They play catchy music that almost everyone knows and that is easy to dance to. This is great, but the 4 times that I've been there they literally place the SAME EXACT songs. What's more, every time we try to talk to the DJ (it's been the same guy every time we go) he says they don't take requests. My boyfriend tried to get him to play a popular salsa song so our large group of friends could dance to it and he said \"sorry we don't play that type of music here\"... he then played a Pit Bull song and said that's the closest to salsa he can do -.- Overall I love the place it's just somewhere I wouldn't go that frequently because they never change up the music."}
{"text":"Worst Food in the Southwest?

This is a very unique  place. I'm sure there are good reasons to go there, but please, don't go there for the food. And if you do go there, make sure you eat first. Go to drink, dance, party ... but not to eat.  Horrible food, egregiously overpriced.

We went for lunch.  We were the only people there at noon,  not a good sign.  The ribs were simply terrible. For $14, you got  ... six small ribs; that is all.  They were clearly warmed over, and appeared to have been cooked day or two or a week? earlier. And they were barely warm. Simply dreadful.  One of us ordered the sliders, and they were equally ghastly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great food!  Great company!

We first saw this place on DDD and though it looked interesting. We then found it in the Best of Phoenix and were intrigued. 

Their dips were great for starters. The meals and desserts we had were good as well. The atmosphere was awesome. While you are waiting for your meal you can enjoy the live DJ, play ping pong or corn hole. They offer karaoke and boxing on specific nights as well.

Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Not worth the cost. I have absolutely no problem paying more if I get more, quality not quantity wise. The Duce didn't deliver. I spent over $20 for 3 sliders, a bag of chips, small lemonade, and a slice of banana cream pie. Plus I had to walk up to order and pick up my meal myself. 

The pie ($5) was good, but not good enough to salvage my meal. The bag of chips ($4) were burned and salty. The sliders ($8 for 3, no sides) were alright at best but served a little cold. My lemonade ($3 for a small mason jar) was way too sweet.   

I really wanted to like this place. It has tons of potential. The decor is cute. The building is great. But the layout is difficult to navigate and doesn't really maximize all the services being offered. Multi-purposed spaces are not a new concept! The execution is just off. So is the cooking."}
{"text":"The Duce is one of my favorite spots in downtown Phoenix. Unfortunately, the drinks are somewhat overpriced in my opinion, and they still don't have A/C. So the drinks are just ok, I've yet to try any of their food, and the service in my experience has always been very average.

Now that I've got all that out of the way, The Duce is still a cool place to hang out. It's a truly unique atmosphere. They've got plenty of games (including ping-pong tables and cornhole!), they've got hula hoops, they've got punching bags, and even a boxing ring (although this is out-of-bounds for the general public most of the time).

The on-site retail store is trendy though (again) high-priced. It's fun to look at, but I would never shop there. If nothing else, it does add to the general ambiance of the establishment.

NOTE: be sure to check their calendar for a list of weekly events. They've been doing a lot of really fun events lately, not the least of which is the every-Tuesday South Central Swing Night which consistently draws a large and interesting crowd of regulars."}
{"text":"Made it to the Duce for an after party after a wedding on Saturday night. 

The bar did a great setup for the group allowing us to have exclusive access to the bar just inside the building to the left. 

While I can not talk to prices (open bar) the drinks were great.  How can you go wrong with a muddled drinks made from fresh ingredients. Our two favorites were strawberry limeade and a basil mule."}
{"text":"I go here to swing dance Tuesday nights with my boyfriend which is always a blast. I am never able to make swing classes because I get off work. This seems to be the only venue that serves alcohol which helps me get over my swing dancing jitters (I am much more attuned to salsa, belly dance and hip hop). I like the hoola hoops and games in the other room so that friends who don't dance can still be entertained. They may want to move one of the tables out of the way to make the dance floor a bit larger. 

I have eaten here once. Rachel was super helpful. She was bussing above and beyond and accidentally took my sliders before I was done, which are delicious. When I asked her about it, she ordered me a whole new batch. The bartenders are half descent. The older lady is cute but a bit slow and the other one looks like a bar back and isn't aggressive at all. He didn't say hi to us at the bar so I waited for the older lady and he ended up serving someone who came to the bar after me. I bartended for years and would never let something that happen. I will definitely come back though as this place is super fun."}
{"text":"We pulled into the so-called parking lot which is very narrow and full of potholes (in Phoenix? ), so we pulled out and parked on the street.  We went in through the store, the place is cavernous. We were directed to the food truck.  Saw pEople working out in the boxing ring.  It was chilly,  headed to a table with a heater to wait for the food.  There is table tennis,  cornhole, and foosball to play while you wait.  The food was very good,  We tried the pecan French toast,  mac and cheese muffins,  homemade chips with onion dip,  strawberry bruschetta and pb and jam sliders.  They were out of jam,  so they used honey and bananas. The hot chocolate was made from scratch,  so it took a half hour to make.  Other than a few glitches,  it was a fun place to go with tasty food.  Next Time,  I would try at night to see the vibe and have drinks at their antique bar."}
{"text":"This place deserves a great review for it's concept and uniqueness. Don't come here if you are expecting the norm.  This multi purpose building (boxing gym, bar, clothing shop, bike shop, bar, pie shop, restaurant) can be a one stop shop for just about anyone.  I have not had the pies but the food and drink menu is definitely up to par with the great detail that has been put here.  Don't let the area freak you out, yes its a bit dead and maybe not the best place to ride your cruiser too but definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"DRESS FOR THE WEATHER! Luckily for us, someone gave us the heads-up that there is no AC, so we showed up in appropriate desert attire. So, if you don't mind the glimmer of sweat on your forehead then this is the bar for you! I think this place is pretty Avant-garde in comparison to the typical phoenix bar scene. You do feel transported to Minnesota circa 1960 on a hot summer day. The indoor decor looks like it's been purposely chosen from a garbage dump but that's the point! The rusty old designs combined with a bit of pinterest-inspired barn chic decor really give this place it's personality. So, don't be a hater and just go with the flow. The drinks are pricey but at least you get what you're paying for! The salty mad dog is so delightful and refreshing, especially after you've worked up a sweat playing ping pong, foosball, or hula-hooped 'til you dropped. Maybe that's the point...more sweat = more money spent on drinks! And if you're a fan of the Cubs there is a whole section of the gift shop dedicated to Cubs paraphernalia. Lots of other goofy shirts for sale as well, if you're into that! Also, they have a large projector screen hanging down in front of some bleachers; the first time I went they were playing an old movie, and then the second time they were playing a sports game. I would love to come back again when the temperature comes down a bit, I'm sure this would be a very fun spot to hang out on a Fri/Sat night."}
{"text":"Used to love this place...cool environment.  But, the staff of amber crombie frat boys are beyond terrible. Never have I ever been treated so poorly downtown than I have here. Worst moment: valet guys tried to pick a fight with me and flicked me off as I was leaving...I did nothing to provoke. Advice: get staff with customer service skills not a bunch of pompous frat boys."}
{"text":"Truly a unique space! The food was 3-4 stars but the drinks are 5 stars hands down. The bartenders for the event we were at were true artists! I love all the fresh fruits and unique ingredients that go into their signature drinks. Great selections as well. I have been twice now and both times had appetizers and they were all good but not great. The chicken sausage was not good at all however. The meatball sliders were the best and the brisket was pretty good. Services was attentive and fast considering how many of us there were. They have all kinds of fun games to enjoy, boxing rings for certain nights, some kind of salsa or other dancing lessons on the night we were there, etc. Unique place to have some fun when you are downtown or want to have an event or just a few drinks. They do valet the cars, no charge just tips :) Always a bonus when trying to find parking downtown!"}
{"text":"My party and I happened to find The Duce while waiting for our conference to start. We were smitten when we walked in to the open eating area. The hostess greeted us and explained how to order food and to look around at the fun retro stuff. Where else can you find corn hole, ping pong, and boxing in one place?? The food was amazing! We ordered the family slider sampler and picked short ribs and brisket. They were both so delicious and very filling. We also enjoyed the Mac n cheese muffins-heaven!!! I just wish we had saved room for dessert!! I guess I will have to wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"I visited the Duce during the Urban Wine Walk  April 20.

When we arrived there was an A-Frame sign up notifying patrons about the Happy Hour Specials.  It was the beginning of Happy Hour and we were excited to save a few bucks on some cocktails.  We waited at the bar and there was no rhyme or reason to how the bartenders were taking orders from guests.  We waited, and waited, and waited, and literally had to flag down someone to allow us to pay top dollar for drinks.  There were no mac and cheese muffins as advertised on the Urban Wine Walk website and map.  

https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=212580392842748430696.0004cd4c1e46626d4526f&msa=0

When we were told our total we asked about it being Happy Hour.  The female bartender said there was no Happy Hour even though there was a sign.  So, we paid our $4 extra to avoid a scene.  Interestingly enough, the A-Frame sign with the specials was gone.  I believe some people were being charged happy hour and others were not.  We were not provided any receipt for our cash purchase.  I called The Duce at 4:54, during their supposed Happy Hour, and asked about Happy Hour.  The bartender, Brandon, said they did have Happy Hour.  I asked where the A-Frame sign went and he said he didn't know.  I gave him my name and number to give to the owners because I wanted to discuss the situation with the owner.  I did not receive a call as of 5/17 so I emailed the address listed on the Duce's website. 

Within an hour of my email, I spoke to the owner and instead of saying, \"Gee thanks for notifying me to this\" he ripped me a new one and said he does charity work and has been open for three years and he was asked to support the event.  He never acknowledged my concerns. 

Update:  The owner called me back to tell me off about this post.  

You can listen to the voicemail here:  http://youtu.be/is34g74NZw0

I'm sorry sir, but I can afford to drink at your place or anywhere else I choose to spend my money.  I do have a job, and it pays quite well.  Rest assured, I will never be returning to the Duce.  Aptly named, Duce, as in a fecal movement."}
{"text":"On the Ale Walk I try here in Phoenix. Off the beaten path. Super cute inside! Something fora all age groups to look at! That's at best to say! Ordered the Mac & cheese biscuits as shown on Triple D. Super disappointed!! 25 mins later cold cold cold!!!  Hate to take back but we all walked to sample (not nice area). Booo!!! I sent back got back luke warm sample but worse condition. Crowd was much more pleasant than staff  and food nothing great.  Head closer to stadium action. This place isn't ready for prime time!!"}
{"text":"So had heard about The Duce many times prior but never believed the hype. Went over there last Saturday night after a couple of other stops throughout the day and the DJ was rockin' it from the moment I stepped foot in the establishment until they shut it down!!!  Great atmosphere, kind of on a younger tip as it relates to the clientele and the staff but great energy and a lot of fun! We ordered food, they were really down to barebone minimums by this time so we ordered a combination of the sliders: meatball sliders, which were my fave-brisket sliders, and chicken sausage sliders. Each of them were good but in my opinion the meatball were the best! Definitely recommend this spot if you're out to have a good time and dance the night away. Also, there are other activities on site which are really cool as well. So go have fun and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Duce!

This is a pretty cool place. Very unorthodox bar. It is a bar that doubles as a retail store, a boxing gym, and a middle school basketball court. Not really, but it may confuse you the first time you walk in. 

But seriously, this place has a boxing ring, a set of bleachers, and a bunch of shirts and clothes that I still do not know if they are for sale. It's a large warehouse building that is split into many sections all with different themes. They have a game section, with bags, foosball, ping pong and hula hoops. There's a dance floor behind the boxing ring, and a large open patio area with a dessert station. 

I haven't yet been hungry at the Duce, so I haven't tried the food, but from what I hear, it's pretty solid. They call your name on the PA once it's ready. Thought that was cool. They also have alcoholic shakes if that gets you going. 

I cannot see how one can be bored at all here. There is too much to do, which in the Duce's case is not a bad thing. The best way I can really sum up the Duce is by calling it a clusterf*ck of cool sh*t. Call an Uber and pop in (there is like no parking...but it's a bar and you shouldn't be driving anyway.)"}
{"text":"Terrible food!!! good ambience but food is horrible. Great music and it was a fun place with good service. everyone is friendly they just need to upgrade the food."}
{"text":"Loved it!

Sliders were awesome! Very unique concept that works!

Go for date nite, drinks, or bring the kids!"}
{"text":"Best part of the Duce is  the Karaoke host Luis! Was there last night and the crowd went wild when Luis did what he does best, host Karaoke. Great night, good crowd, good times."}
{"text":"This was a very neat place. Restaurant, shop, games, etc. I tried to the chicken pot pie in a jar that was featured DDD. Lovely people and awesome food. The atmosphere was so, so cool."}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix and have heard about this place so we stopped there for lunch today. It was 110 degrees outside and I would never think any place with no a/c would be open. The place had fans, but it was just blowing hot air throughout the tin roof building. I read through these reviews and am surprised the air conditioning was only mentioned once. We were literally sweating the whole time and couldn't enjoy the atmosphere or food because of the heat. Granted we were the only two there eating lunch so locals probably know to not eat here when it is hot outside. But why the heck would you be open and put your employees through the torture?!"}
{"text":"Some good ideas...zero execution. Literally the biggest shit show I've ever experienced. Food was quoted as an hour wait. We were here for a bday party so accepted it. Waited over an hour and a half. I would recommend coming on a week day if you have to subject yourself to it at all"}
{"text":"I have to be honest...if you're going for the Mac n cheese muffins, then go. Those were the ONLY positive experience myself and 3 friends had at The Duce. Maybe it was an off day for the restaurant, but I felt there were too many issues to give it a good rating. The atmosphere and decor is pretty cool though!

1. There were two weddings going on. We accidentally walked through one to the \"Sweet Shop\" after the hostess/bartender told us we could order dessert there. We were talked to by another employee who was upset we did this. We tried to explain that we were told the opposite. When we went to order dessert from the food truck, we were told we'd have to wait 20 minutes.
2. They were out of so many things. Could've been the fact it was Sunday night and a holiday weekend, so it was understandable. They had none of the pie jars, which was upsetting.
3. There were multiple over-served customers (not part of the weddings) that were seemingly not asked to leave. They were stumbling around and displaying way too much PDA for a family-oriented place.
4. We were told we'd be brought our food because they were not using the microphone due to the wedding. About 20 minutes later, we hear our name called for pick up. This was confusing.
5. Almost none of the baskets at tables had any forks and all of the water stations were empty. We had to ask for plain water for my friend with a fruit allergy and were met with unfriendly help.
6. When we finally ordered two milkshakes and asked for to-go cups, we waited another 15 minutes only to get them delivered in jars. Cue another 5 minute wait for the transfer.

Overall, the food was decent but the lack of communication amongst employees was extremely discouraging. We wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Fun place for sure. But very un organized. Ordered ribs and they lost the order. My girl ordered banana bread somethin and it was suppose to have ice cream. ... no ice cream. Not to mention they didn't even give her utensils. Hopefully I'll get my ribs soon."}
{"text":"Years ago, we met up with some friends for a going away party at The Duce, and my husband and I were thoroughly impressed. It was one of the first times we experienced craft cocktails that require a fair amount of labor to create rather than the standard stuff we used to drink in college. The food was good, and the atmosphere was fun. We started recommending The Duce to people based on that one visit.

Since it had been so long (5+ years) from our first visit, we decided to hit up The Duce after a Suns game. The atmosphere was still great especially with the beautiful weather, and it wasn't too crowded. In fact, the bar was missing its bartender. We waited for awhile and was told by another employee that he would return, but we started giving up hope. He finally returned while I placed our food order.

I experience the same delay at the food trailer. A couple people told me the cashier would return. After some time, the cooks finally paged the girl overhead. No apologies for the delay, just like with the bartender. The food did come out quickly, but it was wrong. We ordered plain chips, but the kitchen was out. Of course, the cashier failed to inform me. They told me I could get a refund which normally I wouldn't do for $4, but considering the minuscule portion size (just a bit more than a handful), I waited yet again to get my money back.

The drinks were much worse than what we experienced on our first visit. My husband's old fashioned was more of a cooler because it had soda in it. My brown derby was drab and overly sour.

Next time we're downtown, we'll head over to the Palomar where we can get much better food and drinks for the same price."}
{"text":"This place looks awesome. What they have done to this dusty building is amazing. I love the vintage look and the decorations. The bad... $4.50 for a PBR? At happy hour? Are you kidding? I'm no beer snob but I like an ipa or even a pale ale. Nowhere to be found. They only had these old Milwaukee beers. I mean that's cool if you're going with the theme but have more beer maybe? A pint of Santan epicenter was $6.50. No thanks. I'm outta here."}
{"text":"I am in love with this space. It is amazingly awesome. Um, why isn't there a place like this in SF??? Seriously, you would think that SF would be cool enough to have a place like this, but I sure as heck haven't found out about it in the last 6 years. 

Anyways, enough venting. The Duce is super rad. Why? You just need to see it. My mom took us here, because she was meaning to check it out herself. It's basically a large warehouse space that has everything vintage/modern. There are tables outside to eat at, as well as a food truck. Inside there are more tables, and a tasty lookin' selection of grub. There are little counters around the edge of the rest of the space, for milkshakes, etc. Ahhh it would be sooo much fun to go to an event here at night, or just a cool place to hang out. I also liked the items they had for sale, ESP the adorable pink polka dot girly aprons. I really should've bought one, what was I thinking?? 

Basically it's awesome. Period."}
{"text":"Dinner and dancing, both are top notch. The pie crust is perfect, I had the chicken potpie.  Trust me, anything will taste great in that little pie crust lined mason jar.   My wife had the sliders wrapped in lettuce, between the grilled onions and seasoned beef there is a ton of flavor in those little guys.  

On Tuesdays they East Cost Swing and Charleston.  When we were there the crowed was a great mix of 40-60 people of all types and skill levels.  It was a super cool sweaty celebration with more smiling and laughing then a comedy club.  

Until you are inside this place is sketchy; the downtown location, parking and the building itself give off a vibe after dark somewhere between urban decay and warehouse district.  The payoff is inside and well worth the adventure.  See you there!"}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience coming to Duce. I couldn't tell what the place was. Bar part restaurant part boxing gym part clothing store.  It would have been nice to have gotten an explanation as to what Influenced the design. 

The service was some of the worst I have ever seen. The woman who took our order was very rude and unhelpful.  Several times everyone in our party saw her giving us evil looks from behind the bar. Very awkward. 

On the bright side the food was great. The rib and brisket sliders were delicious. Another let down was that there were no free refills. That would have been fine if the drinks weren't served in kid sized glasses. 

To conclude, the poor service cost Duce a good review and a repeat customer. There. Good food is not enough to get me to go back. Instead next time I'm on that side of town looking for bite to eat I will go to Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles across the street."}
{"text":"If you like hipsters, hippies,and over priced shit food with bartenders who cant even make a Greyhound or White Russian then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"So fun, but it is pricey! Boxing ring, ping pong, corn hole...plenty to keep you busy all night!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I were in Phoenix from So Cal visiting. My buddy who lives there said we should check this place out, super cool vibe; music, atmosphere, drinks and the staff were all spot on! I travel a lot and have never ran into a place quite like this. Great service from all the staff there, especially two really cute girls who worked at one of the bars by the door( Briana and Maddy) if you decide to stop by, Deff look out for them! I'll for sure stop by next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the space is fantastic. Steve and Andi Rosenstein have put the time into this place to make it great. The attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed.

I've been coming to this building for a few years now, both for events and to occasionally check out the couple's retail concept, R&R Surplus, which has occupied the heart of the building for a while now. When they trucked in the bar from an old Capone Chicago haunt about a year ago, I knew something special was brewing. 

I love the patio space, with ample hangout room, close proximity to the bar area and easy view of your food cooking on the open grill or in the airstream trailer kitchen. The flat-screen TV has become a go-to spot for Suns games, which I'm totally cool with.

Inside, it can be a bit of a sensory overload -- let's see... there's a bar, a coffee bar, a soda fountain, a produce stand, the R&R Surplus area, a flower shop, a milk stand (yes), a gym, bleacher seating and rehabbed old school Schwinns littered about. There's even foliage in there, so it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I respect what they're doing, but I can't imagine many people will be walking up to the coffee area's streetside window. We'll see.

I'm not crazy about the parking situation. I'm not sure if it's out of necessity, but it seems the place at least shares a couple of adjacent lots, and the fences and blockades around the parking areas make it a bitch to get in and out (seriously). I've been here a couple of times now, and when it's packed, you can wait a long time to get your car back, even if it's parked within eyesight. 

Yes, the cocktails are a bit pricey. But, I've been impressed with each I've tried so far (Moscow Mule, screwdriver and a punchy spiked lemonade). The $3 beers ain't bad, either.

They seriously need to do something about paying at all the different sections. I don't know if they need a computer system or what, but opening a tab at the bar, then closing it, then paying for food at the kitchen, then paying for food at the grill, then going back to the bar (and that's just food and drink!) is absurd. I offered this suggestion to an employee and pretty much blew it off. Not what I was hoping for.

Yes, there are some kinks, but the potential of the concept is hard to ignore. This could really be a shining jewel of the Warehouse District. And no, it's not really off the beaten path, people. It's three blocks from US Airways Center."}
{"text":"Imagine every hipster, Pinterest-inspired wedding you've ever seen. Then mix all that into an overblown cliche. The Duce would be the result.

Mason jars everywhere. Park benches as tables. Barnyard and rustic \"chic.\" And they ask for your \"crazy nickname\" when you order. I was waiting to find the photo booth.

Overhyped if you ask me. I can see why Guy Fieri would recommend it.

Mega overpriced menu with very limited options. The kitchen is an airstream trailer.

Also, it's half gym...? Weird."}
{"text":"Many mixed signals at this place. This could be a duffer or a must-go depending on what you want:

2 stars - process. You have to go up to one window to order your food. You have to go to a different place to get your drinks. You spend more time away from your table than hanging out with your friends. The bar drinks are delish but they take forever and you are standing at the bar the whole time waiting for them to be painstakingly crafted.

5 stars - vibe. Super chill, laid back, a little hipster. Certainly come-as-you-are. Chill picnic tables, both high and low tops with hangout-type yard games. Loved it.

2 stars - service. People seemed irritated often, especially those who you have to collect your food from when they shout your nickname over the loudspeaker (and yes, a nickname is required. They ask guys to come up with a porn star name; girls, just any nickname will do).  

3.5 stars - food. I had the egg sliders. Delish. I also ordered, as an extra, their pickled slaw. Not great. It is not mixed together (the cabbage is separate from the slaw topping), but they serve it in a container way too small to allow me to mix it up myself (this might be a new pet peeve of mine...food served in bowls and plates that are clearly too small). 

So you need to decide what you're looking for. If it's a chill atmosphere with yummy drinks (that you get yourself and take a bit of time), then this is your place."}
{"text":"So yeah!!! This place was recommended to my wife by friends who lucky I still call them friends after my experience.  The setup is cool, it is swanky and hip.  I dig that. 

The food I give 4 thumbs down. I had eggs, only thing I could eat pretty much. My wife had the ribs, which I will suggestion you avoid at all cost. They, the ribs, straight assaulted my senses. And we had to 30 minutes wait when nobody was really there. 

Customer service was okay. Really nice bartender. Very helpful.  The girl who took the order, helpful.  

Parking: it sucks! 

Drinks are good though but pricey. 

Overall: I more than will not return and my stomach hurts from the food."}
{"text":"I went with my friends and family and had a great time. I got the black blue pancake for dinner. It was so delicious. But you are ordering from a permanent food truck. (Stays in one spot). And there is only one kitchen, so if you are going and it is packed then your food may take a while. When I went there was a reserved party for like 125 people who were all like 26. So it was crazy and really loud. There are fun things to do like ping pong, cornhole, boxing, and connect four. There desserts are really delicious and when you order you have to create a funny nickname for when your food is ready. Overall it was a fun place with delicious food, so I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Dinner before the basketball game. Mac & cheese muffins - must have. Sample slider all good but personally loved the brisket. 3 cheese dip delish. The dice lemonade which is homage and worth it not too sweet or too tart and you don't taste the alcohol. Love the ambiance!!!!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience planning and hosting my daughter's 17th birthday party with the help of Frankie in Event Sales. She was extremely accommodating and a pleasure to work with. She went beyond the call of duty in answering my questions and helping me make decisions.

The Duce was a perfect location for a party with all ages. The teenagers had a great time playing corn hole and ping pong and the adults had fun cocktails. Everyone loved the decor.

Now on to the food, this is why we wanted to plan the party at The Duce to begin with. We have not had anything at The Duce that was not amazing. The sliders are great and the mac and cheese is delicious!

All around The Duce is always a great place to go."}
{"text":"A funky bar with food is the best description for this little joint; . it's actually a huge Warehouse build in half indoors and half Outdoors with funky drinks made with fresh fruit and delicious pot pie served in a mason jar .We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a tough one. I first heard of this spot a few weeks ago and have been dying to try it.

Today I decided to take my Mom out for breakfast and we hit The Duce. Getting there early, we had the place to ourselves. As others have mentioned, there is a LOT going on here, it can be a bit tricky to navigate/comprehend what all is going on, but it's very well done.

The Duce is housed in a beautiful old warehouse in downtown, and if you loathe strip malls like I do, you'll find The Duce a welcome change. Concrete floors, old brick, reclaimed wood, it's great.

We were warmly greeted by a friendly woman who explained how things worked and gave us the lay of the land. The staff member told us about the great food and told us to either order at the bar or trailer.  We wandered around, taking it all in and then went to the food service/bar area of the business.

Because we were having drinks with breakfast, we decided to order at the bar. After waiting seven minutes to get someone to come over, an angry looking guy ambled over (picture a chubby Amish guy with terrible prison quality tats)

I say hello to the .bartender and tell him we wanted to order breakfast. He grunts, looks displeased and says that we're supposed to order at the trailer. I inform him that we were told we can order here, and since we want drinks we decided to take care of it all at the bar. Speaking of booze, I ordered two bloody mary's. The bartender made a face that would have made sense if I asked him for a kidney. He looked under the bar and said he would only be able to make ONE bloody mary. Keep in mind we are the FIRST customers on a Sunday morning. I was truly puzzled that they could not have the basic ingredients for a breakfast drink staple, much like how it would be if In-N-Out ran out of hamburger.

I pay for our stuff and he mumbles something that could be Mandarin, or Pig Latin, I was unsure. I asked him to repeat himself and he was able to use his words and tell me to listen for my name to be called  when our food was ready. We found a seat and my Mom was asking what the guy's problem was, and I told her I wondered the same thing. Fellow Yelpers, please know- I am a really laid back guy, I don't get stressed, and can tolerate a lot! That ends when you're treating my Mom poorly, that is NOT okay, especially when we passed over 100 different breakfast spots just to try out The Duce( Matt's Big Breakfast anyone?).

Moving on, sorry this is sooo long, but it was so shocking how shitty the service was, really! The place was really cool, the food was pretty good, and the other employee was SO sweet, but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender. He truly was a turd. Yikes.

I will be giving this place another shot, and hopefully they find the bartender a personality transplant and/or the right combination of meds so he no longer a prick. If not, they will need to change the name of the place from The Duce, to The Douche."}

{"text":"Overpriced drinks. Terrible service regarding food. I wish I could review the food, but I waited over an hour and didn't get any food. The atmosphere is cool and the concept is alright, just poorly executed."}
{"text":"Everybody calm down. Put your Two Door Cinema Club and Andrew Bird albums away. I see you have the newest Apple product...   alas, they are no auditions happening at this time for Portlandia in this place.

Ok now I have that of the way. Aside from the iconic NW drab and decor, the Duce is the best place you dont want to enjoy. Reason being is, the place cultivates trend, and epitomizes liberality from the AZ Scottsdale gilded cake faces and shiny car Dbags. 

A centralized focus on passive cult trends and proactive enthusiasm for the antipodes.

I see the NW, where the happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good, and against some greatly scorned evil.
 
Welcome to AZ.

NOte, Trying to cover the overhead? PBR? 3 dollars?  Easy breezy...it is just beer. Kinda $$$."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe....old warehouse turned in to this funky bar/playground....the staff were a lot of fun, and I bet the place gets CRAZY on a Friday or Saturday night!! The food is decent as well and everything is priced accordingly....will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar that brings back the old school vibes of Chicago. Met the owner over the weekend and you can tell why the poace is so beloved. Great drinks and beer selection. A must if you are in the PHX area."}
{"text":"At first I didn't find any appeal in dinning at a place like this. Best way to put it, the duce is more  like a place for single people who drink, eat, and dance. It's good for parties and what not. It's gets really busy and packed at night! They have a complimentary valet. Overall, despite the unusual experience, it wasn't bad. I didn't eat anything, but the drinks are good. Food can be a little pricy. Drinks are average priced. I'll probably be back one day..."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with a lot to do. Great bar and drink selection. Great food too! This is a great place to come and hang out."}
{"text":"Ah \"The Duce\"! I was fortunate enough to attend a company event here with a concert. This rating is not for the event because the company who put it on did a great job! The concept for this place is great, the feel is very cool. It reminds me of several of the old music spots from when I was a kid back east. We did not eat any food so I can not comment on that. Some advice I have to whoever runs this place. To start the night we were crammed outside waiting for the main doors to open. Drinks were sluggish and hard to obtain in general. It took 20 minutes to get our first drink at a walk up bar. Once inside loved the idea, but execution is lacking. Again, drink service was lacking. Add bartenders! Bottle fresh squeezed juice instead of squeezing each drink! Now....the drinks were outstanding! A little light on the pours, but the taste made up for it. The layout inside is confusing. I liked it but success is in the details. It seems like the owners or operators have a great idea but they may not have any restaurant/ bar/ music experience. Last, as the band was playing we could hear the food orders over the PA system...... Uh I don't care who's order is up. It is rude to the band and hard to stay focused to the music for the listener. I will go back which is why I gave this place 3 stars. Not sure how long they have been open, maybe it's just issues with a new place."}
{"text":"This is a really unique place. If you just want to hang out and have drinks in January, this may be a great option. However.....My co-workers and I tried to have lunch at Duce during the week because we had heard the sliders were scrumptious. We ordered lunch at 11:30AM and left with no food at 12:30PM. The kitchen is just too small and disorganized to produce meaningful amounts food during lunch hour. There was also no evidence of any management on site. Waiting for an hour without A/C for no food was a real downer and has soured our opinion of this joint. Triple D got hoodwinked on this one."}
{"text":"We had my daughters graduation party here. I must admit after emailing back and forth with the party planner I was worried. She seemed a little negative and we were getting opposite answers from her than what we had been told when we visited in person. We couldn't afford the packages they offered and I was hesitant after that not so positive emails, but decided to go with our original plan- we ordered giant pitchers of tea and lemonade, as well as, several appetizers. The girl at the trailer was super helpful and accommodating. We were originally told we'd need to arrive early to save spots since we were doing the party on our own. We got their an hour ahead of time and while my dad was checking out the place he stumbled across some saved seats with my name on it- pleasant surprise!! All in all it turned out great! We got several compliments from our friends and family that showed up, some even stayed after the party had ended to continue having fun with all of the games! I would have given 5 starts, if not for the party planner, as she was not very helpful, and was the main reason for any stress surrounding the party! Also- would be nice to be able to bring in our own cake!"}
{"text":"It's located in a sort of run down area. I was unimpressed with the amount of food and quality that you get for the price. It was really loud and I ended up tipping (push the smaller no tip button on the bottom of the screen to not tip) assuming they bring the food to you, but you stand there for your silly made up name to be called. This place pales in comparison to the 5 other places you pass to even find it. I was thoroughly unimpressed, but I guess it's a great place for hipsters to hang out."}
{"text":"The Duce has great food and a fun atmosphere. I love the swing lessons on Tuesday nights, the macaroni and cheese muffins are to die for and their mixed drinks are always amazing!"}
{"text":"Not too crowded after a day game at Chase Field. This place is located just outside the \"ballpark\" zone, so probably doesn't draw that kind of crowd. The additional parking sign could have been better as we ended up having to pay for a few hours at the meter instead of finding the overflow parking. Inside, the place does have all the fun stuff and we played pong, foosball, cornhole and checked out the shop and boxing ring too. We had no line ordering and food was out quickly. 
   Mac N Cheese Muffins - what else can you say..these are top notch and filling.
Brisket Sliders - great brisket, no fat and soft rolls with a tasty unknown BBQ sauce
Shepherd's Pie in a jar - another winner. The potatoes were so creamy (and colorful) and each bite was pretty wonderful with the slightly greasy meat and other ingredients just coming together in a good fashion.
   There was no AC (swamp coolers) in this giant warehouse (rough in July) and the famous pot pie uses mixed dark and white meat, but otherwise this was a pretty fun experience and great food. Oh yeah, happy hour has $2 beers, but Hamm's was a bad choice."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch! The mac & cheese muffins were awesome. We also had a basket of various sliders, yummy!!"}
{"text":"The Duce was our 2nd stop of my family's quest to try as many of the Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives restaurants located in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  If you want to take the entire family to an adult and kid friendly restaurant, you won't be disappointed by this fun and foodie friendly destination.  

Don't be deceived by the old looking, warehouse-like appearance of The Duce.  You'll be pleasantly surprised by all the quirky things found inside.  Prominently displayed as you enter the restaurant are the spray painted picture of Guy Fieri and his framed picture next to a Coca-Cola bottle fridge indicating that The Duce was featured on Triple D.  I took my son, niece, nephew, and in-laws and their eyes widened with joy as they saw all The Duce offered.  There was a full size boxing ring, boxing heavy bag and punching bag, ping pong tables, fooseball table, bean bag toss games similar to horseshoes, apparel store with quirky tshirts, hats, and shoes, bicycles, soda shop, and old school bleachers.  You have to check out the restrooms, which have corrugated fencing for toilet stall dividers.  Right where Guy's spray painted face is, there's a DJ platform playing classic, old school music.  My family loved this place so much that they would have been content taking selfies and photographs of all the cool, picture friendly sights.  I really loved this place because of the ping pong table and the really fun games.  My son and nephew would have rathered play all of the games then eat.  I'll take both the food and games.

Fun, interactive games and delicious food. Sign me up.  The Duce did not disappoint and once again, Guy Fieri knows great food.  Don't let your eyes order the food because if you do, you'll order more than you could eat.  My son and I ordered the family sliders comprised of your choice of 7  delicious sliders.  Honestly, this family meal is more than enough to feed a family of 4.  I picked the cheeseburger, egg, brisket, barbeque rib, and chicken sausage.  I loved the egg, chicken sausage, and cheeseburger.  My family loved the brisket.  The egg was dripping with finger licking yolk and combined with thick, savory bacon, I wanted another one.  The sausage  was thick and juicy.  I know, I know, that's what she said.  Cheeseburger was tasty and had yummy, melted cheese.  The bread used for the sliders were inconsistent, some hard and some soft.  Wish all of them were soft.  The one thing that is a must order are the cornbread, mac and cheese muffins.  These moist, cheesy and fluffy delights were morsels of foodie goodness.  OMG multiple times.  One thing I forgot to mention are the shakes.  My niece had the s'mores shake and my one slurp made me regret not ordering it.  Wow, it was sweet, smooth and I loved my tease of this delicious drink.

If you're looking for a fun, interactive restaurant that serves delicious, tasty and filling food, drop into The Duce.  After the tummy busting food, you might have to drop a Duce.  Their restrooms are clean and fun to hang out in, so you'll be alright."}
{"text":"I have heard about the Duce for a long time so I came in on a Saturday during the day. Other reviews have mentioned how cool the place is. Totally true! Very little parking. 

Highlights: the drinks. The bartender made the drinks in mason jars and would put on a top and shake it in the jar and serve it to you. The Bloody Mary used locally produced Bloody Mary mix, fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice, muddled olives, celery salt, and a pickle. 

The Mac and cheese muffins are sinful and delicious with panko bread crumbs. 

During the day it's pretty empty and laid back."}
{"text":"Duce's Wild! Me and 4 girlfriends came here Saturday for drinks and food and had a blast!
All the drinks were made with fresh ingredients, my favorite has to be the Cherry Sidecar made with strawberries. You can't taste the alcohol but I was feeling great once we left 
The d√©cor is very vintage and unique. I highly recommend this place especially for a big group."}
{"text":"I LOVE this spot! It is one of my go to places now! The drinks are great and the atmosphere is even better. They have multiple bars inside, dance floor, games, little place to shop, great music! I will definitely be back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is for the younger crowd, but we found ourselves visiting for a company party. It is a great place to meet up with friends and play games. There are several ping-pong tables, toss games, checkers, and foosball! 

I guess cocktails are good as well. The beer selection is generic macrobrew, which means typical American beers. 

The best thing was the valet parking! They are on top of it. www.EpicValet.com Waiting for our car which did not take long at all I had time to talk with employees and found out they offer valet service to Phoenix Sky Harbor! New service. Drop off car at the airport and they pick it up and park it in their secure location. You can have it washed or what ever while in their care. Car is dropped off when you arrive at the airport ready to go! Can't wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm undecided about this place.  I heard about their drinks made from fresh fruit and was interested to try.  What I did not expect was that it was going to be an old school gym/boxing ring/ping ponging place serving food out of an airstream.  

I can't lie, the drinks WERE good.  They seem a bit spendy but given the size, it feels like a decent deal.  However, we later concluded that they aren't terribly strong and they use ice to make it seem like you're getting much more than you actually are.  

The food was surprisingly good.  The mac n' cheese muffins were pretty tasty and the s'mores cheesecake (which, be forewarned, is an actual small cheesecake) was quite delicious (although maybe a skosh too much marshmallow)."}
{"text":"Place is kind of cool. Restaurant, bar, boxing and they sale clothes. Also have a place to play 4 square. drinks are awesome. haven't tried food yet.  No air conditioning so dress the part."}
{"text":"Really recommend Tuesday Swing Dancing. A lot of fun -- cool people throughout All levels of dancers -- it was my first time. Good date night :)"}
{"text":"This place is so friggin' cool, I am surprised that more people do not know about it!  Um, I think you HAVE to love beer (specifically Wisconsin beer) memorabilia, you have to love Anthropologie like clothing, you have to love good old fashioned drinks, like Greyhounds, Old Fashioneds, and Sidecars.  You have to love home made potato chips and a wait staff who want to call you by a nickname.  You have to love cool, old warehouses and funky people, and the unexpected.  I'm in love."}
{"text":"How do I explain the Duce? Sometimes I think Phoenix is what Brooklyn could be if it had more space. 
The Duce seems like an experiment- it's a bar/dessert truck/boxing ring (?)/dance floor/general store/wedding reception space and probably other things I'm leaving out. Here's what you need to try: apple cider beer- it's locally made and crazy-delicious. The bartender told me all girls love it! My boyfriend and I were silly enough to split a smore's pie we saw off the menu of the cute little aluminum dessert truck. We thought it would come in a mason jar situation, but it was the size of nearly a regular pie!! My fork had greater staying power than his, but even I had had enough of marshmallowy goodness. I'm not sure if we'll be back but it's definitely worth a visit. I'm still dreaming about that pie."}
{"text":"Great place! Dropping my son off to college and thought we would try it out. Came in on Saturday afternoon and it was the perfect time. Not packed at all. Order you food and play the games while it is cooked to order. Everything was cooked perfectly and the taste was ridiculously good. Walked out happy and full!"}
{"text":"The place isn't hard to find, just keep an eye out on the left when you're heading south on Central. Get to Lincoln and take a left.
 My first impression, parking is waaay tiny and seemed to be first come first set-the-rule-for-everybody-else.
 I guess after 5 it's valet, so add a second tip into what you expect to spend when comin' out. I'm not cheap but I dislike the valet in your face idea that seems to be creeping up to casual places. But hey, that's me.

 Your first experience is the retail area. Some of the clothes look fun but it's pretty much greys, khaki's, and greens in various rugged incarnations. Kinda wish I'd have gotten some of those boots though. 

 The produce area was an afterthought. I'm at a place that has a a portion of the word 'Produce' as it's name and the only thing that I considered taking home was a lemon...to clean my garbage disposal. I had been hoping for some jalapenos or cabbage or pickled something. The salsa in the mason jar was tempting, I'll probably get some next time. And those boots.

 A  nice fella came over to chat me up when he saw I was poking about. He explained to me some of the highlights of the place, the old school bus they'll use to ferry people to first friday and home games, the stadium benches they have in front of a decent size projection screen for watching games (and a larger flatscreen in the booze area!), etc. etc. He was warm and genuine and told me that they really want to be a place for locals. Come down, bring a book, get a soda or a beer, take a nap, hit the heavy bag for a bit and grab some grub before going home. Like a YMCA for the hip and spendy. 
 When I was there two guys were doing a pretty legit workout. Pullups, speed bag, timing each other, etc. There is something ultra satisfying to be sitting at a bar, drinking a beer, with the *real* sound of a slappity-thump-thump badass on the speedbag.

 I could see doing that. I got a vibe of  potential hang out, regular friendly, new social experience. 

 The staff was great at handling somebody who was trying to figure out what was what with a place that is wearing so many hats at once.  
 The bar has a great selection of drinks made easy. If all else fails you can pickup a chalkboard menu at several spots and just point at what you want. The beers are on ice right in front of you so when you take that first drink you're reminded that not all beer should be Sono-err-Sun Up Brewing style and served a fistful of degrees above room. If it's triple digits outside and you're in a big brick building an ice cold beer can kick ass. 
 I gotta say though, a can of Old Milwaukee, for $4? Really? I can get a six pack of Simpler Times at Trader Joe's for less than that.
 I didn't get to try the food, I was still stuffed from lunch, but the smells coming off the grill were great.

 If this place gets some decent happy hour specials I'll be there pretty often."}
{"text":"We did not have a good time, we waited 15 minutes at the bar and the bartenders ignored us and went straight the the caucasian customers. Eventually we got fed up and left."}
{"text":"Worst place ever wouldn't let us inside because of some event...was not told before hand. Patio smelled terrible...sewer issue never come here!"}
{"text":"What the hell is this place? Hipster heaven, bring the kids and babies to drink night?  I can't even imagine work get togethers here with all the kids running around. Had a beer until my party arrived so we can leave together and thought about food. Line was long for no reason and on top of that, the food wait was one hour! What is going on here and who had the idea for this place? I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I love this place in every way. I tried to read recent reviews to see if there was a temperature issue since I have never been there in the summer and I know they only have swamp coolers. Well tonight it was quite warm and only fans were used. I saw they got new swamp coolers but they didn't seem to be in use. Bummer. I agree that their drinks are expensive ($5 for strawberry lemonade that was mainly ice.)  but the ambiance is awesome and fun. We had to ask the DJ to turn down the music so we could talk."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place but tonight was just lame. The DJ sucked & the live music was awful...no dance music, nothing. I used to be totally willing to pay a ton of money for drinks here but now that the vibe has changed I probably won't be back. We came with a large party & we were all just praying for the band to be done and some fun music to dance to. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Yet again triple D doesn't disappoint. This place is great the atmosphere is contagious and the food was great. I will be back and I'm bringing friends"}
{"text":"Super fun environment! I had a great time. There's a lot of activities, great food, and good fresh drinks! I would recommend this place for the weekend. Great place to have a great time with good company!"}
{"text":"Interesting place, many activities for families to do. It took two hours to get our food order due to some in-house computer glitch. Kids were starving and we received two free orders of Mac n cheese muffin shareables, which were out of this world delicious. The adult lemonade and vodka was tasty too. Our sandwiches were okay, not great. I would return for those fabulous m&c muffins!!"}
{"text":"This is a magical place.

I was here on a Thursday night when it wasn't very crowded and I assume it can get crazy. This is a massive space, like an old boxing gym (there is a ring and punching bags). You can have drinks, play cornhole, sing karaoke, buy vintage clothes, whatevs.

This is the grown up version of the place you design as a kid. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun. The DJ on Saturday was brilliant. The food is a bit expensive but the mac and cheese muffins were incredible. There is an amazing open roof section, a cool dance floor, a bunch of games, and a boxing ring right in the center. The atmosphere is more casual and almost like an upscale dive bar. If you want to let loose in a t shirt and some jeans, this is the place. A little low on bartending staff but those try keep know what they're doing."}
{"text":"We sauntered down here after a ballgame to grab a drink on a Saturday night. Like other have said, it is in a dark part of town, so make sure you have a buddy or two if you are parking there. The place screams hipster, but is tolerable for a few hours, especially since there is so much going on to distract yourself. The snack food was decent and the drinks were original and decent. Since the place is essentially a giant warehouse it is great for larger groups, however, as others mention it might be uncomfortable staying there for a few hours given the AC situation. One thing that really confuse me was having a boutique-like store in the middle of place that is essentially a bar and adult playground. If I was ever interested in buying a $180 sweatshirt, I doubt it would be from the same place I order a GnT from. I probably wouldn't make a special trip, however, will keep it in mind if I am ever looking for something different downtown."}
{"text":"I was at a running event and I happened to see a warehouse surrounded by chain link fences and with christmas lights on the doorway. I walked in to quench my thirst for adventure and expected to get stabbed, but I was greeted to what appeared to be a mix between a 50's style fountain shop, people dancing to swing, and a scene from Million Dollar Baby. 

I ordered the short rib sliders expecting some cardboard white castle knockoff, but what touched my taste buds was pure meaty tenderness melting away like butter with a kiss of apple leaving me wanting for more. 

The service seemed great to me. The girl near the trailer area, she rocks and was about as high spirited as you can get without drugs.

In short, this place has a lot of soul. It reminds me of some places I use to go to in Austin. I'm glad places like this exist in Phoenix and hopefully stay around so that my options aren't limited to yet another sports bar with patrons staring slack jawed at the plasma screen ahead periodically grunting loudly when something happens."}
{"text":"Fun and very inventive dishes that taste amazing.  Tad pricy and drink refills aren't included, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Not sure if you'd call this place a restaurant, an amusement park, a vintage clothing store, or a soundstage for a '30's Chicago boxing movie.  I just know I love any excuse to go there and have fun! Steve and Andi have created a one of a kind place with something for everyone.  If you're looking for some place memorable to take visiting guests, think this place.  I think this year's Christmas wish list is going to be \"anything vintage from the store at The Duce.\""}
{"text":"First time I went it was a weekday happy hour in January. I absolutely loved it with their unique ambiance and their food truck kitchen and their creative yummy drinks. But my recent visit in a hot and humid summer afternoon changed that completely. It's a warehouse turned into restaurant, so there's no a/c in there. In Duce's defense, weather was bad. But that wasn't the only problem. I was at the bar for a good 10 mins. I didn't even get a \"I'll get you in a minute\" from the bar tender. I decided to be a teetotaler (for the day, of course!) and moved to the food counter. The line was bog which is ok. I ordered a scramble. ETA - one and half hours!! It actually took more like 2 hours. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS!! I had ordered avocados in my scramble. I got none of it, nor an apology or even a mere mention. Bottom line - the restaurant looks cool and unique. But all that becomes irrelevant when it fails in the primary objective of an eatery which is to provide food and drinks to its patrons. This is also in a not-so-great neighborhood. So if they don't get their act together soon, people will just stop going."}
{"text":"We enjoyed awesome cocktails and some kick butt sliders! Our favorite was the brisket sliders! Then, for desert we had the cinnamon cheese cake. It was a little too much for 2 people but we brought the rest home and will be having it as a midnight snack! Yum!"}
{"text":"Really a cool set up....mostly outdoors or at least open to the outdoors, boxing ring, good bar, picnic tables (you can bring the pooch!), small retail area, etc.  The mac & cheese balls were so good, the sliders were good, the drinks a little on the pricey side but they had some unique ones to choose from.  Overall, a fun place to visit!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Love cocktails and music. Food is yummy but takes a long time. I left my wallet and they put it behind the bar and nothing was missing when I went to fetch it."}
{"text":"I went there a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend and we decided to order the french toast and a side of scrambed eggs with spinach and chicken sausage. The food was pretty good especially the french toast, but the service didn't match. Well I guess the service did match...the name that is. If the food wasn't as good as it was  I would've given this place 2 stars. My girlfriend wanted to order coffee and they told her that they were all out. There was only one pot sitting at the counter and it was empty. One pot??? For a place this big they only make one pot of coffee??? A couple of minutes after we ordered our food a two people walked up and ordered theirs. Our food came out somewhat fast, but theirs did not. They didnt get their food until at least 15 min after we ate ours. A couple of others walked up to order coffee and the host/server said they were out. The guy asked if they could make more but all the server could say was \"we've been getting orders for coffee all day and we keep running out.\". The guy asks if they could make more and the server just throws his arms up. The man looked pretty upset and just walked away. He couldve just took a couple mins to brew a fresh batch but didn't. This place needs to get better training for their servers."}
{"text":"This is one of the best hangouts in all of Phoenix! Great for anyone and kids. As a parent, you can hang out get good eats and your kids will have some entertainment. They have bean bag toss, ping pong, space to run, a store to explore and the best part. An amazing selection of craft drinks and adult beverages ;). The food is served in adorable mason jars and is hearty and delicious! They have a good cover of gluten free items for folks like me. This will always be my anytime hangout in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I love it.  An amazing multi-use building full of all kinds of cool things.  The food was fantastic, the music was fun, the fresh squeezed lemonade was tasty and the atmosphere was super cool.  No poseurs here."}
{"text":"So unexpected, so fun, so yummy!

The venue is a huge space.  Retro w/o being trying too hard.  Loved having a DJ spinning motown.  I'm struggling to think of a place in town with drinks as terrific as these.  All are made from scratch as each drink is made.  Fruit cut, oranges squeezed on a per drink basis.  And the sliders are a treat, especially the brisket.  

We were there on a slower night and still had a blast.  I'd love to see what it is like when it is really hopping.  Can't think of a better place to take a big crew."}
{"text":"Looking for a fun place to throw your birthday party or even just wind down on a Friday night? I LOVE the retro-chic atmosphere of The Duce for any occasion! It's fully equipped with a delicious food truck {best sliders ever}, fabulous mason jar drinks, activities, art and really anything that your heart desires. You and your guests are sure to have a fun time!"}
{"text":"Hosted 30 people. A good time was had by all. Music was fun and danceable. Enough space and things to do that folks with children were comfortable. Food was good. Everyone raved about the Mac and cheese balls. Skip the Chile though. Dips good, deserts good. Sliders okay. 
Good thing they have fans cause it was warm in thete. Good hoop dancing was great. All in all a fun venue and I would recommend. Kudos to Keeley."}
{"text":"What a hidden friggen gem! From the outside you have NO idea what to expect but I was very pleasantly surprised. Around each corner is something new and exciting from the kareoke to the dance floor, to the boxing ring, to the food truck, and the store. Tons of fun!!! I can't wait to go back. My only complaint but also a compliment is that the drinks are pricey. Most likely because they're made with all organic fruits or veggies, etc. They're delicious - don't get me wrong! I tried their lemonade with vodka and also their bloody mary - YUMMMM! But they're pricey ($12+) and they take FOREVER to make. I sat at the bar for probably 20 min before I was even acknowledged. The bartender wasn't being rude, just really busy. I would have drank a lot more if it didn't take so long to get served. 4 stars for the ambiance & the cool vibe. 2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"This place is really unique, lots of games, lots of sitting areas, great dj, two bars a place for food even up until 11 (maybe open even later than that not sure) overall, I really like the layout. The reason why I had to take 3 stars away was because it was dangerously hot (112 degrees no airflow no breeze indoors) and there was only one large fan for that huge enclosed game room area and dancing area. I don't see how the workers were okay with such poor conditions. Everyone was sweating and my friend so dizzy and so sick that she threw up because of the heat. It's unacceptable to work in that kind of condition! Workers were running around doing their job with sweat dripping down their face! There were people walking around with under boob sweat (men and women). Even the bartender was so busy quickly wiping his sweat several times before it could possibly fall in your drink!! I'm telling you the heat and lack of ac or air flow in a huge venue holding about 100 people absolutely CAN'T be unjustified. If Arizona doesn't have any strict building codes for providing proper air flow or air conditions for communal places, then I feel sorry for the workers!!! I hope this post can help spread awareness to the owners on how uncomfortable my experience was and provide a better working condition for those hard workers there. Couldn't even drink (no business) because I was so focused on hydrating and keeping my blood pressure low from the anxiety. Horrible place for the summer time. And I feel bad because like I said in the beginning, lots of great perks for a fun night out in downtown. Just no ac!"}
{"text":"Loved this place from the second we walked in! So much going on. The drinks were delicious and the whole chicken was amazing. We also got a couple sides, both of which were also fantastic. There is an area where they teach swing classes, which was a lot of fun to watch while we ate. I would love to come here regularly. I would like to try other drinks and menu items, as well as try a swing class."}
{"text":"Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!"}
{"text":"The Duce is without question one of the coolest adaptive reuse spaces I've ever seen.  Located just south of the Downtown Phoenix high rises on the northeast corner of Central & Lincoln, The Duce has breathed new life into a warehouse building that likely would've otherwise stared down the barrel of a wrecking ball.  Built in 1928, the old Anchor Manufacturing building was bought in 2007 by Chicago transplants Steve & Andi Rosenstein who then poured years of rehab work into the structure while adding tons of nostalgic touches.  There are so many personalities in this one spot that it really does need to be seen to be believed.  I've known about The Duce for years, but wasn't sure what to make of it prior to coming here.  Reviews I'd read about the food in particular were mixed, so I wasn't sure what I'd be getting into.  Finally, I made my way here for an early Tuesday dinner.

Parking at The Duce, as others have accurately noted, is a challenge.  The main parking lot is super tiny with room for no more than a dozen cars (& even then its a tight squeeze).  There's supposedly an overflow lot on Central & Grant (about two blocks south), but I didn't confirm that.  I did notice they started complementary valet parking at 5pm so if you're coming anytime after 5 it appears they've got you covered.  Enter through the building's east side onto the main outdoor patio where you're greeted by a bar on the right & an airstream trailer on your left.  Order your food at the counter in front of the trailer & then proceed to wander.  Once inside the warehouse, there's so much to explore you'll forget how long it took to get your food.  Among the things to see & do inside: Another bar, a dessert bar, corn hole toss, ping pong, hula hoops, vintage clothing & accessories, a boxing ring, foosball, shuffleboard, & tons of seating (including bleacher seats).  For those of you who've been to Sam Fox's The Yard, think of The Duce as The Yard on steroids (& at least 3 times bigger).  This venue has big events written all over it.  If I were having a big reception or get together, The Duce would be an ideal space with lots of food & drinks to choose from & tons of activities.  

The menu at The Duce is all over the map, but I had seen from Guy Fieri's visit here how so much of what they make here is put in jars.  So okay, let's have something out of a jar.  How about their Buttermilk Mashed In A Jar?  And yes that would be mashed potatoes with copious amounts of butter, & I got them loaded with creme fraiche, bacon & cheese.  I also decided to go with their Slider Sampler plate.  A meatball slider, a brisket slider, & a chicken sausage slider to be exact.  While I waited for my dinner I walked over to their dessert bar & ordered one of their pies in a jar.  In this case, an Apple Caramel pie in a jar with whipped cream seemed appropriate.  Total cost for all the food including tax came to $24.

First, the Buttermilk Mashed.  Superb dish served piping hot from the trailer with nice chunks of bacon & lots of cheese.  I wasn't kidding when I said there was a lot of butter in these, but I'm not complaining.  Great starter.  Next up, the sliders.  The chicken sausage is simmered in PBR (just the way I used to do sausages in college, actually) & topped with peppers & onions.  Not bad, though from my experience a brat is the way to go when cooking in PBR.  The meatball slider is a mix of veal, pork, & beef & coated in tomato sauce & what I believe was shaved parmigiano reggiano cheese.  No qualms about this one.  Super juicy & the meatball was plenty large.  Lastly, the brisket slider.  The gal at the front hyped this one up quite a bit for me.  Though if you've been to Little Miss BBQ as many times as I have, that's a pretty tough standard to top.  The Duce's brisket is quite good & the slider portion was hearty, but c'mon we both know nothing beats Little Miss brisket.  All in all an okay slider trio.  Lastly, the Apple Caramel Pie.  I have to take some of the blame on this because I should've insisted on having this heated up.  Because getting through the crust of the pie was brutally tough.  The crust was thick & pretty rock hard.  If I had nuked it for a minute, this pie would've been perfect.  That said, once I did penetrate the crust there was plenty of delicious caramel mixed in with those apple slices.  So lesson learned:  If you get the pie, ask them to heat it up just a bit.

In terms of a venue, The Duce is 5 stars all the way.  Super eclectic, super unique, super fun spot that would appeal to pretty much any age group.  Heck I'm thinking I should take one of their swing dance classes on Tuesdays.  As far as the food, I'll give it 3 stars as it was a little hit or miss.  The menu is as creative as the space itself, though with somewhat more mixed results.  As a whole, a venue that everyone should come see at least once.  Its a marvel of creativity, innovation, & nostalgia.  And big enough to invite your whole neighborhood over"}
{"text":"Giving one star took effort! Moving forward I will ALWAYS read reviews. AMAZING drinks, hands down! A little pricey but fresh organic ingredients make it worth the price! Swanky spot with a dope atmosphere. Good music too! Very slow service, below average food and small portions. My hubby & I are gluten free and most of the menu contains sliders. I ordered the ribs and my husband had an egg skillet. I took one bite and left my food on the table. I may go back but it will only be after dinner and for drinks only! And...I plan to email the restaurant about my concerns."}
{"text":"This place is something else... Hidden just south of Downtown Phoenix right behind US Airways Arena. You'll miss it if you're not looking for it and you'll be glad if you drop in. Hard to explain the concept but it's an old historic warehouse --turned gym/bar/diner. You walk in and you'll see an old Airstream parked inside, cooking some great sliders and desserts! Walk into the next section and you'll enter the bar area...very vintage look to it, with karaoke the majority of the times I've been there. They offer organic liquor and it's actually not bad. If you order mixed drinks or anything of that nature, they use fresh fruits and will make everything fresh! Look into the next room and you'll see the boxing ring, then a little further you'll see vintage clothing for sale! This place is definitely somewhere to take guests from out-of-town or a place to grab a great drink with friends. Just go there!"}
{"text":"Great concept!  Something Phoenix sorely needs.  A creative approach to retail.  Kind of a Fred Segal wanna be on a small scale.

Now the bad news.  If they don't get the retail side of this concept going right off the bat they will blow it.  A space this big needs some serious energy!!!  Get rid of the gym area as no one will use it for its intended purpose.  Pump up the retail!!!!  I get that you want to sell your own brand but when that brand is mainly thermals and army pants it is not gonna happen.  Don't put all of your eggs in this retail basket.  This is AZ bring in some great t-shirt lines, flip flops, athletic gear!!  And the #1 seller in AZ JEWELRY!!!! Lines to consider; splendid, C&C, Seneca Rising, James Perse, Rene Garvey jewelry, Lost Bird jewelry (a local)))
that kind of vibe will do wonders for this place as these designers have a huge following even in Phoenix!

This space is crying out for cool trunk shows on the weekends by great local designers!  I'm not talking Grandmas knitting I mean cool stuff.   Think Renegade crafts people!! This is also a great way to build up the customer base as you put some of the work onto the crafts people.  Choose locals who have a following!  Not only do you get a % of what they sell but you get their customers!!

And the music!!!  C'mon!!!  Have to find good bands.  No more Joe Shmoe and his keyboard.

I'm hoping this place figures it out cause it could be really cool."}
{"text":"I first entered The duce on October 15th, 2009 when Mayor Phil Gordon hosted a tour of renovated downtown buildings.  Steve and Andi Rosenstein have taken a vintage 1928 produce warehouse and turned it into a mixed use building containing a bar/restaurant, retail space, coffee bar, florist shop and gym. This is a very cool project that will be a staple of the \"new downtown\" scene in Phoenix. Check it out!

Revised Post Opening:

Opening weekend went well although by all admissions another two weeks of setup was needed."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just too old for this place but as a 30 year old, I felt like an outsider.  Everyone there seemed to be between 18-22, which to me, seems strange at a bar in downtown Phoenix.  I would have expected feeling that way on Mill Ave! Not that I go to Mill Ave ;) but seriously.  I was with a group of people ranging from 26 to 35 and we all felt extremely old and out of place.  It's a young, hipster place where there's only one beer on draft (it was some vanilla Hefeweizen.... I never heard of Hefeweizen with vanilla and I think there's a very good reason) and nothing good in bottles either (budweiser, miller high life, PBR, schlitz, etc).  How couldn't I find even a Bud Lite or Miller Light?!?!? We stayed for about 10 minutes before calling it a night."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I can't wait to come back and bring some girlfriends.  This place is so different, I told my husband this is what I imagine a bar in Alabama might look like, kind of Hillbilly cool without the banjos.   LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.  The drinks are amazing.  I had a couple of the mojitos and they were delicious.  The drinks are made with fresh squeezed juices and you can taste it. My hubby had the Duce Margarita and he said it was fantastic.  We ate a selection of the sliders.  My favorites in order were the egg, brisket, cheese, meatball, chicken sausage.  I also had the sweet potato crisps.  Yummy sweet potato chips, Andy the owner told me they baked them not fried, bonus.  Music is loud, and the ambiance is so much fun.  Andy is so nice and friendly, can't wait to share this experience again."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place. Let me count the ways:

THE PLACE: Its beautifully industrial, vintage-trailer-park-chic, best-friend's-backyard sort of place. There is no roof, no windows and no overhead lighting. The white Christmas lights surround the walls all-year round and the rows of pinic tables are decorated with fresh flowers regardless how many times people grab them as hair decorations. The food truck is located inside the metal-sheet walls and the makeshift yet beautiful bathrooms remind you that a lot of care was put into this place. On the other side of the bar a whole warehouse of vintage furniture, farmer's market items and games (like hula hooping and darts) make it the larges adult playground ever.

THE DRINKS: Mason jar placed and perfectly executed, they have a full built-in bar with an extensive original cocktail list and a patio bar with a smaller one. The cranberry cobbler is sweet, tart and not overly girly. The mojito is tart yet well executed and the drinks are very approachable at a $8-10 for liquor $3 for beer. Every single cocktail is made with fresh fruit, as you see the bartender grab an orange/grapefruit/lemon from the baskets and cut/juice them for each glass, adding agave nectar for extra sweetness. Its as fresh as it gets and incredibly surprising at a night time bar.

THE PEOPLE: Pretty awesome, both for the working folk as well as the attendees. The bartender in the patio area was very nice and funny and managed to keep a smile despite my friend's glass-breaking, drink-spilling, loud-acting debauchery. She deserves a gold medal for that crap. The strangers were friendly and everyone seemed very open to meeting each other.

THE KARAOKE: Damn that DJ has a voice. A very sultry sultry, should've-joined-a-90s-boy-band voice. All the basics were covered, from Celine Dion to Mariah Carey to Tina Turner. Everyone did an excellent job at background singers/dancers and many rocked our socks off with their crazy good voices. The song book was extremely extensive and the DJ did a great job at keeping the mood positive and fun.

THE OVERALL: The vibe is chill, its drunken, its party mode, its hang-out mode. Its everything you want and more. There isn't a bouncer to stare you down and threaten to kick you out if you don't behave, nor a server that clearly hates her life but is still there serving you a PBR, nor the slutty cocktail-dress dramaholic looking for her pop-collar jersey shore prince. The people want to be there and the image of people riding vintage bicycles around the warehouse is unique, kinda like this place. 

No hipsters, no douchebags no yuppies. Just people. Its good to see that once in a while, ya know?"}
{"text":"Great place. So much to do. Great food and drinks. Friendly staff. Food took awhile and they ran out of some items."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has only 3.5 stars. It's amazing! All in one. Ambiance. Music. Delicious food. Customer service was great. Ping pong, corn hole, foosball. Super rustic and funky looking inside. Seriously?? It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Nate is the best! I highly suggest you order whatever be suggests! Stumptown Smash or basil gimlet...everything is awesome"}
{"text":"I will NEVER be back. Was here for my sisters birthday, I brought her a cake for a gift, wasn't going to eat it there and it was a fully packaged store bought cake. The management would not allow it in the restaurant, not even for a few minutes so she could see it when she arrived. The manager was rude and unreasonable. Then, we ordered drinks and headed over to the corn hole area and we were told no alcohol is allowed in the game area. There is no air conditioner, in Phoenix, and had to sit outside. The drinks are crazy expensive, I don't know why anyone would go here."}
{"text":"First time at The Duce. Small parking lot but not an issue at 11 AM on a Sunday. 

I ordered a cheeseburger from the menu and she said they only serve sliders. Okay. I ordered the famous Mac N Cheese Muffins and she said they only have Bacon Mac N Cheese (for a slight upcharge). Okay. I added an Iced Tea and it came to $20.25 plus tip. That's a lot for sliders and 'fries'. 

My lunch was ready in 8 mins. You have to find a table in the open-air place but then leave your drink to go back outside to get your food. Okay. 

The sliders were a good size. They were juicy, with plenty of caramelized onions. They were very greasy tho. You can make juicy burgers without being greasy. I think they had the grill too low, so they pooled in fat. 

 The Bacon Mac N Cheese bites were okay but not spectacular. Again, extremely greasy. No topping crunch and no 'brown' spots on the bottom. They were either cooked too low or were old. 

Probably won't return considering the price and quality."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Bar and food service is sooooo slllooooooowwwwww. After an hour from time of order and multiple times checking on our order, we received our sliders and were asked by a friendly staff member if we knew \"it was an hour and a half wait time for food\". Clearly we were never told during ordering that was what the deal was or obviously we would have gone somewhere else but maybe that's why we weren't informed. The bar tender seemed like he really didn't enjoy working and after 20 minutes I finally was able to place my order. The drink was delicious but upon receiving my change I realize he had charged me much more than stated on the menu. I didn't care because I just wanted to leave, tipped him anyway and we left. Highly understaffed for a Saturday, cute decor but won't be back and highly surprised that for the size of the building there is only one tiny kitchen for that many people. I'm sad because I had great expectations and it didn't come close. Maybe it's better in the daytime or if you rent it out?"}
{"text":"This bar is so cool!! I felt like I was in some sort of movie when I was there with all the swing dancing going on. I also love how they have a lot of different games and things to do besides stand around and drink. They have ping pong, wrestling, that game where you toss the bags etc. Their cocktails are also amazing! I got the organic margarita and it did not disappoint. I also wasn't hungover the next day (and I usually get bad hangovers). I think it was because it was organic and fresh! The bartender, Luke, was so cute! Told us the history of the neighborhood and place. Too bad he's only 21, ha. I don't live in Phoenix but will definitely come back to this place when I'm in town!! We were here for a company gathering and the event organizer did a great job putting together a fantastic food menu. Loved all the carb and cheese options (my favorite.) Definitely one of the most unique bars I've been to."}
{"text":"Kool place but you'll be waiting a loooong time for your food.  It took an hour and ten minutes for them to cook my ribs.  I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely great atmosphere.  I had the slider sampler for lunch, I felt it was a tad overpriced.  I looked at the drink menu and felt that was tad overpriced as well, $10 for a 16 ounce drink."}
{"text":"Three stars, may have been four if there was some type of air conditioning system (it's at least 100 degrees in the summer, all day and night, how do you expect me to eat in that weather?).

Order food at an Airstream and they'll call your name/nickname when your order is up. 

I enjoyed the Strawberry & Pecan salad, the Coca Cola came in the tall version of the old bottles, glass. I also ordered the Brisket Sliders, which were really nothing to write home about, save for the bread which was delicious. 

Had I been drinking, their cocktails looked particularly fun. They had some specials posted around also. 

The decor is certainly neat to browse, has sort of an \"amercian gypsy\" or \"high class retro trash\" feel. Had it been in the fall/winter/spring I would have found the unique bench-seating more appealing, however I was sweating profucely on the vinyl and had to sit on a few paper towels so that I wouldn't slide off (I am also 5'3 so I felt like I child in a booster seat bc my feet did not reach the floor). The fan was particularly awesome, must have been an airplane propeller, as it was HUGE yet not effective in cooling. 

Shop merch was fun to scan, but nothing that I would purchase. 

I will try again when I can drink and when it isn't above 90 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Eh, not my cup of tea. Although the environment is super chill, this place is not the place for food. It takes forever to get your food! Also the girl at the register forgot to ring up my chicken pot pie!!!! Ahhhh.... I was so mad and they we not apologetic about it and assumed the blame on me. I guess the girl at the register was new. Ummm.... New people should not be put on to train on a busy Saturday night. The only thing they said was we will get you one but we don't know when it will come out. So I said, forget it. 

I give two stars for the environment but zero stars for the food. I'll probably try it out on the not busy night."}
{"text":"Headed over to this hyped joint for dinner.  Saw lots of different people here.  We ordered the three top popular sliders, the meatball, brisket and chicken sausage.  I enjoyed the meatball the most and the others enjoyed the brisket since it was sweeter.  We all didn't think much of the chicken sausage.  We ordered the baked mini Mac and cheese muffins.  They were interesting but I think a stronger cheese would have been better.  We had floats and shakes which were decent.  We then ended the night with the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  We all enjoyed that after playing some ping pong, foosball and the bean bag toss, yes they have loads of options for people out there including shopping, dancing, hoola hoops and more."}
{"text":"WOW--What a cool concept! They have a humongous, funky retail space, thats maybe half full of vintage fatigues.....old school soda bar....produce stand....home accessories & nic nacs etc..... On the other side there's an eclectic old bar that was transported to AZ from a Chicago jazz club(Super cool), old timey cocktails & beers.....The Margarita was a bit too tart(due to--too much \"fresh lime juice\"-def ask for a lil extra agave nectar) but the brisket sliders were to die for & the Noodle Krugel (SP.) was by far, one of the most amazing  mouth experiences I've had in a while!!! Thank you Ellen for the Suggestion!! On in all--super cool new DT Hangout spot! Ooooooooh & apparently on Wednesday nights their doing a \"60's themed party\" with funky decor & drink specials-they suggest coming in costume! I dig it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty incredible, it is a very large open space almost like a warehouse they converted into several different parts of a restaurant.  I actually went there for a company Christmas party, and it was really cool they had lots of trays of food sandwiches little salads in Mason jars, lots of different appetizers and really fun drinks. Desserts were pretty amazing Smore's cheesecake was to die for. It was a lot of fun a good large open venue they have games and even dancing lessons."}
{"text":"Such a fun vibe here! The environment is perfection. We came on a Friday night & it was PACKED! It was disco night & they had a really fun DJ. We tried a few different items but the chicken pot pie stood out the most, it was delicious! The cocktails were also on point. Parking was a pain but it was definitely worth it. Such a fun place to come let loose."}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit if you are into cover bands and 21 year old wooh girls. They charge 10 dollars for a rum and coke in a mason jar. It's all over the place. I personally can't stand it. Nice cars in the lot though. Scottsdale with a throwback Phoenician name like the duce. To say this is reminiscent of the old produce section of Phoenix is like saying David Duke rally is a perfect representation of the Apollo club. Nightmare. Glad I only had to go there once. The employees were rude. They shouldn't run a barn."}
{"text":"Yum. Not too healthy but something for everyone. Great venue. Totally cool and rad etc. People that run the place are really cool too - whatever cool means ?"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the strangest places I have ever been and it is very difficult to describe.

My wife and I took the light rail here from Tempe to meet a few friends Friday night.  The walk from the light rail station to The Duce took about 10 minutes and it wasn't too bad.  The area looks a bit sketchy but we made it there in one piece.

The place is a huge converted warehouse.  I'll try my best to describe it.....

Bar/restaurant area - plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Great old fashion bar serving great old fashion drinks.  Gin Fizz, Rusty Nail, Old Fashion, Gimlet, etc....Sinatra stuff.  They serve each drink in a jar which is pretty unique and adds to the charm of this place.  Their food menu is pretty limited.  I sampled the bbq chicken, brisket sliders, egg sliders, chips, and corn coin things.  Everything was excellent and made fresh to order.  Nothing too fancy.  Just good ole' fashion bbq stuffs.  One minor issue though....their desserts on the menu look excellent but they didn't have any of them except for one.  Total bummer but it was ok because of the soda fountain thing inside.  Oh...and the entertainer of the evening deserves a special shout out.  It was one guy singing hits from every era while jamming on his retro keyboard/guitar combo thing.  Awesome....just awesome.  

Soda Fountain - at least I think this is called a soda fountain.  Here they make old school sodas, floats and fizzes.  All excellent and bring me back to a simpler time.  A time way way way before I was born, but a simpler time nonetheless.

Inside the warehouse there is also a small movie theater thingy where they were playing some 3 Stooges episodes.  I sat on the bleachers and watched for a bit.

Other than that and a coffee bar the place is pretty much a retail space.  Old school treats, a farmers market, dry goods and clothing.  Probably a bit more random stuff than I remember but that is all that comes to mind.....those drinks were strong.  There is plenty to keep you busy there for a few hours at least.

I liked it that the place wasn't very crowded for a Friday night.  Also, everybody who worked there was very very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"3.5* rounded up, because we have always had amazing service here, and that counts. The Duce was on my radar for a while, and then we were invited to a private event for the American Cancer Society's Rising Star Awards; it fell on my birthday, and The Duce staff went out of their way to put a Hello Kitty Carvel cake the COO of an org we volunteer with bought in the freezer so our group surprised me at the end: Carvel cakes are a NY tradition and this made me feel even more at home in this very home-y, eclectic spot. They even packed it on ice for me so it would keep on the way home. 

It is quite eclectic inside, and during the summer-hotter early October it is a bit warm. There's a gift shop, a boxing ring, FOOSBALL! (I love balls of foos) I haven't done the outside thing, because it has been too hot when we were there. 


Overall, the comfort food isn't going to please anyone trying to watch what they eat, but the IIFYM (if it fits your macros) and carb cycling bros will truly dig it. I like it more as a place to grab a couple of drinks and hang with pals. It is a repeat visit spot for us, and will continue to be."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cool atmosphere.. Good crowd.. Fun music. But as said in the other reviews, service is pretty poor. Even when it is dead I stand around waiting for 15 mins to be asked my drink order. Ill be back though because it's a great little place. Drinks are expensive too (unless you stick to beer)"}
{"text":"Very interesting place...we stopped by last night after we heard it had its grand opening the week prior.  They weren't officially open (decided that was the soft open and would hold the grand opening on 5/23 instead), but they invited us in to have a beer.  All of the beers were throwbacks - PBR, Schlitz, Hamm's etc.  The menu looks unique and the whole concept is very interesting.  They told us the target clientele are families, but I see it more as young hipsters - will be interesting to see how it pans out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!  Went for second time last Fri night...first time i was there for Sun brunch
Everybody had such a great time....such a fun crowd!
And the food is to die for...here's my favs...egg sliders, apple pancake, meatball sliders(best in town) & their pie jars are to die for!
Don't miss their organic cocktails...love the cranberry cobbler:)...and my friend had the peach cobbler...both so yummy!
Check this place out...something for everyone...to eat & do!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time after hearing great things from family members. However, I have to say I would never go back. I was there for a company Christmas party, approximately 10 ppl. One server. Half the table received their food, half the table were still waiting. When all the food finally arriced, there were  no utensils or plates on the table, so most of us were eating and taking the food from the baskets with napkins that were already on the table. By the time the plates came I was nearly finished with my food, but the plates were wet! I was so annoyed that they would not dry plates after recently washing them. Lastly,  I don't remember once seeing a waitress come to out table and ask \" how are doing,  do you need anything\". The highlight of my day was looking at the cute bartender prepare an over price drink for a patron. The bathrooms were disgusting I walked right out! The meat sliders were ok, but the sweet potatoes chips were dry, burnt and tastless. Overall the food got a 2 from me"}
{"text":"Really cool unique place.  Warehouse turned in to a bar, clothing store, ice cream parlor with a boxing ring.  They have an awesome list of mixed drinks, that they do a wonderful job on.  This really is a cool place to go and I would suggest it to anyone as long as the temp is under 90 degrees as this place isn't equipped with A/C.  The only complaint I've ever had was the way they price their drinks.  The prices on the menu are pre-tax.... so instead of rounding up, each drink requires the bartender to calculate the change..... seems silly, but besides this small quirk it's a great place."}
{"text":"My new favorite hangout when I visit downtown Phoenix. We got a tour when we first walked in and the bartender Sadler was super amazing to talk to and we never had to wait for drinks. The bacon Mac and cheese bites were delicious!  They have a super cute retail area too. Definitely will go back anytime I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to coming to this place for sometime, and I was not too impressed.  We came here after going to a concert downtown and wanted a little late dinner.  The place was pretty dirty and struggled to find a place to sit to enjoy or dinner."}
{"text":"Last week we wanted to try a new place for lunch. 
 We found the duce near the stadium. Upon arrival we found a driveway they call a parking lot. We had to use the valet.
 Once inside we found you have to go outside to order your food. After 25 to 30 min. in the cold and wind, we made it to the register. 
 We ordered soup and salad, and were told the wait would be an hour and a half. WTF.  That would have been nice to know BEFORE ordering, or standing in like like cattle for almost a half an hour.
 Our group decided to go somewhere else. (as did many others in line) After three tries to return my money to the card, this girl had to get the manager.  After her three tries, she finally said \"this is as close as I can get. Here's a $1.85 in cash, the rest will go back to the card. whatever. I just wanted to leave.
 The next day, my bank statement showed, not only the original charge still on, but a totally different charge added as well.
 When I showed the manager my statement the next day, she looked it up an said, \"our records don't show that\" Sorry.
 Sorry????  After I pitched a little bitch, she suggested I send a copy of my statement to them. Why? I've got it right here. 
 Called my bank from the \"parking lot\", and they had all my money back to me the next day.
 If you can't find a burger king, and you have alot of time to kill,  this place might be............... oh screw it, If you have to go there,
                               DO NOT USE YOUR CARD"}
{"text":"The food was super good! We tried a little bit of everything from the Mac n cheese balls, the short rib sliders, egg+spinach+cheddar scramble, hash browns, and bacon cheddar biscuits. Everything exceeded expectations! The bartender Brian is also really good, he truly takes pride in his drinks :) . All the drinks are made from real/ fresh fruit juice and are delicious. It's definitely a cool place to chill... Today is Thursday and I think I'm up next for karaoke ! So if you'll excuse me......"}
{"text":"The vibe was great really unique place.. However, the clothing was so overpriced $150 for a no name brand hoody. Drinks are extra as well. And the worst part is the food took 1 hr to come out 1 hr is way too long to wait to deserve more than 1 star. The food was average in the end. Despite the compensation we still left with more to be desired."}
{"text":"Love the Duce!!! Welcome back Go Green Valet, best in town!  Best downtown restaurant and valet company.   Looking forward to nights at the Duce."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Awesome environment and cool place with some antique and unique things to shop. I liked the hang out place on the back which is open and also the space inside has some room for indoor activity.

Great drinks and good food !! One of my favs in Phoenix,"}
{"text":"I feel like the owner has ADD. There is clearly an identity crisis going on in the Duce. Is it a restaruant? Bar? Thrift Store? Gym? Rec Room? Who knows, why are the bathrooms so small? I'm so confused, but my gimlet was tasty and made the experience so much better. Would I go back? Maybe"}
{"text":"I was here earlier in the week for a family event and the the staff was attentive and the food and drinks good. I decided to bring a couple of friends for the experience. Although it was much busier I am very disappointed we put our order in and promptly went to pick it up when called. However or entire order was cold I'm talking cold not even lukewarm.  We gave back the order and the sliders came out again like warm and as I write this we are still waiting on a single item which I have seen multiples of that item come out to others. Im giving two stars because the drinks are good"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I feel like the atmosphere could have been really cool but it seemed like there were way too many parties going on. My boyfriend and I felt intrusive on the parties because they were so large. The staff didn't really seem to know what was going on either."}
{"text":"HORRENDOUSLY overpriced
I cannot believe that we tipped with the suggested tip on the screen since we had to order at the counter then pick up our own food."}
{"text":"Awesome concept! Thank you Megan from Michigan for your wonderful hospitality! Fantastic food, great music, VERY clean and great staff."}
{"text":"After seeing a few pictures on line I've decided to check this place out.  The facility is amazing, (noted that i did not come here for the food) they have a boxing ring, corn hole, ping pong table and a Foosball table.  

The drinks are great, had their mojitos, peach cobbler and a few other.  

The vibe, the dance floor, the dj, and the crowd were amazing...it was a very friendly environment, you dont have to worry about pretentious dbag roaming around the bar or people that think you are just not \"hip\" enough.

all in all i really enjoyed this place, and will definitely come back for another adventurous night!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and a pretty sweet vibe, very laid back and a good place to chill

Definitely would come here again"}
{"text":"SUCH a cool place. 

I feel that my words are not really adequate to describe it. 

Is it a bar? A gym? A store? A restaurant? A warehouse?  

Yes, and no. It's all of those things in a place that obviously defies description. 

If you want a Schlitz while doing hula hoop. They got you covered. 

An excellent mojito along with a game of indoor corn-hole? 
Yup. 

A Mason jar of pot pie, a used bicycle and to hit a punching bag after karaoke?  

But of course. 

What is this place? 
I don't know, but I love it."}
{"text":"Very very cool place to hang out!!!! 

Good Stuff:
The atmosphere is fantastic!! 
So many fun things to do inside like ping pong...workout equipment...bean bag toss...boxing ring...etc. 
Drink was delicious! (Pomegranate margarita)
Bar staff friendly

Not so Good:
They do not have air conditioning so we were sweaty and overheated our entire stay (it was approx 110 degrees that day). 
Drinks are extremely expensive!!!!!! $24 for the 32 oz drink!!!!! (that was mostly limes/fruit)
Food was at a separate counter and you have to stand in the 110 degree heat/sun to wait in line/order/pay.

We may go back...but not order drinks."}
{"text":"The Duce is truly a diamond in the ruff for Phoenix...you can't find anything else like it in the city. I am wholeheartedly in love with the ambience. They miss no details in everything from the *outstanding patio* to the adorable Airstream trailer (the kitchen), down to the style of cooking (comfort food with a modern twist) and food quality itself (superb). 

A friend and I strolled in for a late lunch. We ordered a combination of sides and dishes (everything sounded so good we had a hard time deciding!): slider sampler (4 out of 5 stars), Mac n cheese muffins (A MUST TRY), apple and feta Caesar, and corn pudding. Everything was wonderful and we enjoyed rockin out to their perfect selection of old school classic tunes. Can't wait to go back for the night scene!!"}
{"text":"So fun! Great atmosphere and great food! The mashed potatoes in a mason jar were amazing for Gfree lovers as well as the strawberry and goat cheese salad!!"}
{"text":"We love going to The Duce. It is one of the most unique bars you will ever visit. We live near it and always take our friends and family here whenever they are in town. They have great old fashioned drinks and beers here.  Their food is also pretty good, and one of these days I am going to try their ice cream.  The only thing is that they are pretty expensive. The drinks average around $10 for the cocktails, but they will literally squeeze the juice for the drinks in front of you! They are absolutely delicious. Also, we always walk, but I believe they only have valet parking. There is plenty of parking throughout the downtown area in easy walking distance. Definitely stop in here if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Food is so good and drinks even better. Very cool place to hang out and have fun.  Mac n cheese muffins are heaven!"}
{"text":"Was at The Duce last night partying with a group of people from my husbands work (it was a surprise party for the owners birthday). Although my husband and I had a really good time, I think it was mostly because of the entertainment which my husbands company hired (Doors cover band flown out from NY, hello, hella good!). But when rating the actual food, drinks, service, and venue of The Duce, everything was very mediocre I felt. The drinks were ok although made pretty dang strong. The food had its ups and downs. We were pretty much able to try everything from the corn coins, to the maple ribs, to the Noodle Kugel, to a majority of the sliders (Meatball, Brisket, Caprese, and Chicken Sausage) along with 2 salads (I believe one was the Duce salad and the other was the farmers market salad) along with their home made see through greasy potato crisps. The only thing that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed was the Brisket sliders which were absolutely delicious. Problem was that the Brisket sliders went fast and there was no effort to refill them until close to the end of the party. When we did notice there was more, we grabbed a few and even though they were ice cold, they were still the best thing there. The meatball sliders were ok as well...Aside from those two things, not impressive food wise. For dessert, they were passing around smore cheesecake which was alright I guess but not anything spectacular. Now on to the atmosphere... it was kinda a shmorgusboard (however you spell it) of random stuff in a big warehouse. There were not very many tables although they could have been cleared out for our event, not sure. My husband and I agreed that this place could be really good as a concert venue that sells food and drink as it was a good place to see the show last night. However, it doesn't sound like they have bands there often and The Doors cover band we saw last night was at my husbands companies expense. Finally, the parking seems like it can be a bit stressful if you are not using valet which was complimentary for us last night (not sure if that was on the company or not). I will conclude with this: The Duce was a decent place to host a party and have a band come in and play. They seemed to cater to the party I attended very well although the people hosting are rich so I am not sure if or how much money played a part. Would I go here again on my own though to have a meal or drink? Most definitely not. It is a really far drive from Maricopa and totally not worth it."}
{"text":"I can't put into words what The Duce is. They have three bars scattered around a large warehouse-like compound. Upon walking in, I perused their open space with a shop, bleachers, ping pong tables, boxing ring (used only for events like a wedding), and the trailer outside that serves food.

I sat outside, which is actually covered. It was not packed at all on a Friday night. I had a conversation with the couple next to me and our bartender Jake for over an hour. Jake made me a couple of drinks, a strawberry lemonade that had a lot of strawberry pieces in it. He also made me something like a greyhound. Both drinks were made with minimalist and fresh ingredients and serve in mason jars. 

The Duce is a fun place for all ages actually and very reminiscent of some New South bars (think Nashville). Definitely come here with friends when you're in town."}
{"text":"Awesome environment. The place is in a warehouse,  which sets a very unique interesting and fun atmosphere. Friendly staff, delicious fresh squeezed juice cocktails, many games, such as foosball, corn hole, ping pong, and hula hoops... the list goes on. They also have  very nostalgic shops with unique items to purchase. Great way to spend you days at and relax."}
{"text":"Over crowded.. not friendly staff.. they made us get our own water.. told me they ran out of a certain beer when they didnt.. food is terrible.."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and excellent customer service. I am here attending a company function and the staff is amazing and very friendly. The decor is unique to what I am used to, but the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Definitely an awesome choice for our function."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  We went there in the middle of a 110 degree day.  The atmosphere was cool though.  With that said, the soda was warm, the service was slow, and the food was poor... at best.  We saw one of those food shows that highlighted this places macaroni muffins, which were \"good\", I should add.  We also ordered their hot dog and the sliders.  You could easily make a better hot dog with a package of store brand hot dogs and a microwave.  The sliders weren't bad; however, the bread was stale.  So if you're looking for warm drinks, slow service... but a cool atmosphere, this is your place.  If your'e going at night, don't go alone... cruddy neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party last night! I was so awesome! The Duce staff was very good and helpful. The bartenders rocked it. And the food was awesome! We had the Duce Dip and Strawberry bruschetta, mac'n'cheese muffins, brisket sliders, chicken sausage sliders, duce salad, and finished with shake shots, pumpkin pie, and s'mores pie! It was a nice place to visit, listen to great music, watch swing dancers, and to have fun! Thank you The Duce! :-)"}
{"text":"We came here Friday afternoon since we had a layover in PHX and this place is so cute!! So happy I was able to find this place!

The decorations were awesome! Outside is vintage and inside was so interesting! Boxing ring, some hipster clothes on sale, lots of games to play and a bleachers for people to sit around. Lots of fans to keep it cool. Should be a very fun place to hang out at night. 

We ordered outside and you have to make up some funky name for your order and they will overhead page it when its ready. 
We got the:

Mac& Cheese balls- yummy! eat while its still hot!
Sliders: Brisket- my favorite, cheeseburger- a bit dry.., meatball- it wasn't too bad
Pineapple Rum cake- I can definitely taste the rum! Oh man! 

Check this place out! Pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"I am giving them a 3 because of the delicious mac n cheese muffins they are amazing, however..... Two of the items I began to order are no longer available (ribs and the chips). I ended up ordering the cheeseburger sliders and I was so dissapointed that the meat patty was less than half the size of the bun, OK flavor but certainly way overpriced sliders. I also got the buttermilk chicken sliders but they weren't crisp as you'd expect Panko crusted stuff to be and they didn't have any flavor (seasoning). Lastly, I ordered the arugula salad with palm hearts and balsamic dressing but my salad was way drenched in dressing. If I had an option of a 2.5 I'd definitely give this place a 2.5"}
{"text":"The Duce is fuckin' rad.  They make the best screwdriver.  Screwdrivers are typically boring, but I urge you to get one here.  So bomb.  So goddamn bomb.

I've been here a few times and I've always had a great time.  Great desserts, great drinks.  Some of the reviews say they got shitty service.  Not I.  I've always had great service.  Ordered a shot one time with my girlfriend, there was a bunch left over and got quite a bit of free booze."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool place. It's a neat layout with a interesting concept. The food was really good. The Mac and cheese balls were delicious and I had the biscuits and gravy and it was pretty good as well. I think we just went for our first time on a bad night. There were about 25-30 miniature cheerleader kids running around, jumping on the cornhole boards, tossing bags literally all over the place, and hitting ping pong balls all over the place as well. It's not that all that was going on, I get it, it was that it was soooo loud. The music was killing me. We had to yell at each other at the table just to have a conversation. Otherwise it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Pretty much loving this retro place in central phoenix. The location is pretty easy to find and the place looks really unique. Combination of a bar with gymnastic studio and a boutique. Pretty much a different kind of hang out place! Love the fact that the food was taste good for a bar. I tried brisket sliders which was on a very good portion, 3 mini sliders with a great amount of meat and it was wonderful. This place offer so many entertainment as well. I love their open mic night and yesterday when I came it was a swing dance night. So much fun.

The only reason why I don't give 5 stars is because this place is an open space and even though it has a lot of fans, it still won't take away the heat of brutal AZ summer. Other than that I think this is a very good spot to hang out :)"}
{"text":"Oh how I loved visiting the Duce yesterday .  I  really want this place to become something special in Phoenix.  What cool retro vibe we got going on here.Areas for eating , music and shopping all have a hip vitage feel that makes you keep checking whether things are for purchase or design.  Soda Fountain is as cute as can be..can't wait for your Farmers Market and candy store to shape up in the fall.
Out in the dining area you have a casual long table area inside and a picnic table sensibility outside. The place makes you feel like you want to hang out with your friends all day and just chill.  I had some tasty sliced potatoes  that were half fries ,half chip ,yummy  . This place screams potential.  I am coming back very soon to try their dinners which look really great on the menu...Oh by the way they cook up a bunch of their food in a on site  Jet-stream trailer.  Nice touch.  

Oh and by the way the girls bathroom was completely adorable...I 
actually took pictures of it. It feels like a country powder room . I found it completely charming. 

Rumor has it that they have a school bus to run people up to the stadiums for big events after eating.. great idea."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I Yelp! I start with a disclaimer. I almost did that here because I don't want whoever reads this to think my opinion of The Duce was clouded by my affinity for the team that won the World Series. Then I thought \"screw it!\" I can more than justify the five stars without referencing baseball.

My co-workers are full of good recommendations. The same guy who picked the last bar we visited in Scottsdale, chose The Duce for viewing game seven. I had heard of The Duce on Guy Fieri's (Triple D) show. So naturally, I wasn't going to resist this suggestion.

I love old buildings, especially old warehouses. Take a dash of quirkiness (the food is served from a trailer inside the building) add some variety (there is a DJ, outdoor games and vendors) and you'll have The Duce. The atmosphere here is better than most places you could visit in the downtown area. And the food and drinks are amazing!

To make you feel like you never left the mid-west, you can enjoy ice cold cans of Old Style, Schlitz, Old Milwaukee and Hamm's. If that doesn't float your boat, there are other fine choices available in a bottle or draft, plus a tempting, long list of drinks.

And the sliders are to die for! My friend and I split the Family Slider Sampler which consists of seven sliders of your choosing. Most of the sliders (the egg, the cheese and the chicken sausage) were really good and some (the brisket and the short rib) were beyond good! Seriously, the short rib was heaven on a bun!

There wasn't very much of a crowd on this Wednesday night, plus the Suns were playing a few blocks to the north. It didn't matter. The staff and bartenders were great and they enjoyed watching the game with the patrons. And the DJ played the Cubs victory song. It would be a stretch to say I felt like I was at Wrigley Field. But it certainly didn't feel like Phoenix. Thanks y'all! Go Cubs!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in Phoenix! Nice set up, food was okay, staff was friendly. If you are ever in Phoenix, you should stop in for a drink!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Really relaxed! Super cute decor. The bar tender was SO NICE. They have different events every day of the week. I usually don't love ribs but I got theirs and WOAH it knocked my socks off. So amazing. Mac n cheese muffins are a little dry, but tasty with the BBQ sauce from my ribs."}
{"text":"This bar is really cool. They have a wide range of activities and areas to hangout in. You can play ping pong or hula hoop, be inside or outside and there's a section that you can pay 5 dollars to enter where you get all you can eat pancakes. 

There is also a huge boxing ring in the middle of everything, it's cool but so disappoints that you can't go in it. 

The dj played top 40 stuff and a few random 90s songs. 

The drinks are strong but don't taste amazing, the lemonade shot is gross. The other drinks were fine and they have 3 dollar beers and 6 dollar shots. They don't id you until you try to get a drink which is annoying because they make you show if every time. 

There is a large hipster population here and if you dress too fancy you will stand out. 

The only other complaint I have is it was super girl heavy in there with a few unattractive guys. It may not be like that every night though. The hula hoopers made it difficult for the tiny dance floor to fill up. Once they stopped it was pretty good. I had fun but it got old after a while so we moved on to another bar."}
{"text":"After seeing The Duce on DDD we (5 of us) had to try it during our trip out in AZ.  It has limited parking but the whole layout of the place and atmosphere was really cool. It was 11 am on a Friday. Near empty. The hostess/order taker stated she wouldn't take out order for 20 minutes. \"So look around and then comeback and order.\" So we did. Dropped $56 on 2 sliders, macncheese muffins, chicken pot pie in a mason jar, some corn thing, 1 beer, 1 pop, and an Arnold Palmer. I wasn't concerned till I saw the portion size. Sad... Not to mention it took a while and the service came with some attitude. I will say the food did taste good however.
I was really excited about this place. The owners are from Chicago and so are we. I don't think they were there though. 
Giving them the benifit of the doubt we ordered dessert. Served in another mason jar it shattered as soon as my Father in Law put his fork in it to take a bite. Yikes...
I think Guy built it up a bit on DDD.
High prices. Small portions. Attitude from staff. Equals Bad recipe. I'm really bummed about this. I had high hopes. 
Make your own decisions though. This place could be really awesome."}
{"text":"OMG I was very surprised when my family and I enter the place . The place looked really Country but the food and drinks were really good.  First of all , the food was very well cooked. Our group had :baked artichoke, asparagus and goat cheese, cheeseburger (grass fed beef),short rid braised in wine with sauteed onions, carrots, mushrooms; meatball sliders made with beef,pork , veal and organic tomatoes,bacon Mac  & cheese muffins. All made to perfection, cooked well done. Oh man , the drinks: old fashioned, makers and coke and a strawberry shortcake. The bartender,Luke ( very cute) skills with making those drinks ( please always ask for him; he is a cutie). The staff was very friendly. We wanted the chicken pie jar ( featured On\" Guy Trippled D\" show) but they where out of it.  Overall, I will visit this place again ,next time I am in Phonenix."}
{"text":"I love this place, but the drinks are expensive. I suppose that it's good that the drinks are organic, but there are a bit pricey to make it a regular visit. I have not yet been for happy hour and generally the place is empty which surprises me. 

What I like... 

The DJ is awesome (after 9). He plays oldies that are fun to dance to, karaoke then top 40 dance songs. He always gives me a good energy. 

The food is delicious. Sliders are yummy. The Duce salad is yummy. Homemade chips are yummy! 

The drinks are delicious, yet some are pricey. My drink of choice here is the large Moscow Mule. It's so yummy. 

What bothers me... 

Not a lot of people there. Sometimes there's a bunch of teenagers. 

There's so much going on... Soda fountain, food in a trailer and drinks at the bar. I can't just order everything from my table. 

Honestly, it's more good then bad. I love the atmosphere and energy and everyone who works there is super nice. I would like to become a regular."}
{"text":"We came tonight to hear #Urban #Poetry in #Downtown #Phoenix. Supporting the arts instead of thug life, we were shocked to see the owner call and kick out the poetry group for curse words on their t-shirts and poetry they do not like (no one even took the mic). Meanwhile, the empty venue was filled with patrons the comedy troupe brought in ordering drinks and dinner that would have been better down the road. The Duce may have censored our evening, but they have now also censored their clientele.

My husband said it would've been more proper to let the event happen and then not allow it to happen again if it was something that bothered you but once you agreed to it and this many people put in effort behind it put it on their calendar mark it off as a night to go out on the town you don't screw your customers that way. and yes of course he should've done his homework which I'm sure now he will put a process in place but that doesn't affect all of the people that were there last night. If he wants this kind of white homogenous restaurant he should've opened in Chandler not downtown Phoenix. So rude, so uncalled for, so done with that place and their TERRIBLE parking and $160 vest sweatshirts. Who do they think they are? Solace was watching the entire place empty out into nothing as we left."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here last night and I enjoyed it very much. The place has a retro feel and then they surprise you with a boxing ring that can be used by customers. We had sliders to start with and just ordered a combination of them. I tried different ones and they were all very good. My friends ordered the Pot Pie for dinner cause it was featured on Diners, Drive in's and Dives. They said it was delicious. I had the Shepard's pie parfait and it was very good but had a lot of green peas. Just a little less would have been better for me. If your in Phoenix go here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely perfect. Awesome service, lovely organic prohibition era cocktails, really wonderful eclectic open-air atmosphere.  The Duce is absolutely adorable.  Perfect place for an event.  Also the food is beautiful and they have old school games like corn hole, ping pong, and fooseball... Also on Sundays, boxing!  You gotta check it out!!!"}
{"text":"The place was fun but the service was slow and the food was not great. I guess I was expecting it to be more kid friendly with all the games but they didn't even serve French fries. The prices were high I felt. $54 for two drinks and two family orders of sliders that took almost an hour to get.  Maybe as a bar scene this place would be more fun."}
{"text":"OK. Prior to stepping foot inside I remember passing by this metal shed each time I would go to a D-Backs game. I always felt like I would either get raped or shivved if I strolled in here. I told this to the bartender, who laughed and said \"Well that is a possibility\". So, being a pasty white boy, how could I possibly have fallen in love with The Duce when death is so certain? Well, its because this place is like a loving pit bull: Looks are deceiving!

~What to Do?~
You can drink....because it's a bar. You can enjoy a variety of eats and treats, if they have them. You can sing karaoke, if drunk enough...and you can entertain your large group of friends, if you have enough of them. Besides the wide open space in the main area near the bar, they also have Corn Hole and Ping Pong (or as they say in China: Ping Pang) tables ready to go!

~The Good~
Service is great. The bartender was relaxed and quickly made me a drink after I looked at him bemused by the mason jars and high-end liquors. All the liquor is high-end (blow me, Baccardi) and just adds to the utter ironic nature of this place. A big shed, slinging high quality cocktails in mason jars? Like Marv Albert would say: \"Yessssssss!!!!\" They also offer old-school beers which like dinosaurs I thought were buried long long ago... So long that most of us never would think would be offered at this point. So wrong! You can find them here! It's just different at the Duce. The drink menu is huge, and the drinks are as well. Prices are a bit steep, but these are top shelf liquors we are drinking and the sizes are huge. Do the division, the price is right! Food looks serviceable, it's a give and take menu filled with fun items that will fill most gullets. I am on a diiiet, as in, I die inside when I look at the items on the menu. Looks yummy, I must say. Dessert is off the chain, from regular pies and shakes to spiked floats and shakes as well!! 

Plus, the atmosphere is so chill....so chill. Ping pong and Corn hole in the middle room is an awesome touch, as is the random boxing ring, which I imagine numerous drunks crawl on. Karaoke on Thursday (when we went) was totally fun, even when only 15 people were in the joint. The staff all know how and when to buddy up and talk to their patrons, and make the place even more inviting.

~The Bad~
So the desserts were pretty much all out. I was going to get Laura I. a surprise pie in a cup, and they were all out...lame. That's about the extent of the issues I had with the food itself. As for the venue, it's a tad dingy outside and inside (I mean, come on). I still am not sure about hitting this place up all by myself on a raging Saturday night.. Really though, this place has few flaws and sets itself apart because it rolls to its own beat.

~The Low Down~
There is so much space here! You can take huge groups and bring them for a good time. Whether its karaoke or just because, if you live in Downtown/Central Phoenix, The Duce is an awesome and ironic spot to grab a drink (or 10). I am yearning to go back and fight my fear of being shot. I am curious. Maybe that's why my friends call me whiskers. Because I am curious like a...

4 stars for well-made eclectic drinks, a solid and mouth-tempting Menu, A+ atmosphere, and another star because it said so! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Cool setting.  Decent food.  Speakers are so loud, it's hard to enjoy a conversation.  Got there for brunch, and staff I asked for help (since no one was helping me) seemed really put out.  I'd never been there before and didn't know how you're suppose to go to one bar for drinks, another for food, and that no wait staff came to you.  Lady at drink bar ignored me, so I just settled for water instead.  Liked the ambiance the best out of the experience."}
{"text":"Ok let's talk about the Good first

Good: large place with lots of places to sit and drink. Fun atmosphere. They had a hula hoop competition. Plenty of places to play games like ping pong and corn hole. Fun variety of cocktails. 

Now the Bad

Bad:
TERRIBLE waits. You waited for 30-40 minutes to order a drink. But wait. There's more. 
I waited In line for 30 minutes to order food (separate line from drinks). I ordered Mac and cheese and chips and dip. But that's not even the bad part. I waited OVER AN HOUR AND 15 minutes for my food.  The lady standing with me waited even longer than me and eventually complained to get a refund. Absolutely Awful! Keep in mind they never once told anyone \"hey the wait for food is x minutes.\"  They were incredibly understaffed. 

Totally not worth it. I don't care if you say the food is so good I would think grandma made it or not. Grandma would at least feed me."}
{"text":"I know my reviews of the Duce are all over the place, but I am now starting to think my good experience was a fluke.  The food is good, and they have fresh squeezed grapefruit juice...a must for a serious greyhound...but the service is ghastly.  The Duce is mostly counter service, but there are no signs indicating that, so customers are confused (which typically makes people uncomfortable).  The owners and people who work there will come up to you, but it's mostly to chatter or punch you in the shoulder, then they wander off.  There is no guidance about how to order or how things work.  It's as if you are in someone else's house and you don't know how to behave and your host is offering no guidance.  If fact, I think this is the primary issue...the owners run the Due like someplace they'd like to hang out, forgetting that their vision may not be intuitive to others.

I've had a good experience with the food and the drinks, and I still think it is a cool hip space, but I find the service issues so disruptive that the Duce has dropped to my \"in a pinch, can't think of anyplace else to go with a group\" list, which is a bummer, because if this issue were corrected it could be a great hangout."}
{"text":"If you like shuffleboard, boxing, cornholing, ping pong, parallel bars, shopping for antiques, Hamm's beer, Shlitz, Old Style and Thrifty ice cream, (whew) this is your place.

An old (1928) Phoenix warehouse on the national register of historic places, this venue is uniquely eclectic with all of its weird offerings. 
The kitchen, an old Airstream trailer (polished to the nines) plays host to two chefs, both of whom you can spy on as they frantically prepare your meal.

There are bars everywhere including an ice cream bar, and, a converted hay trailer for what purpose I haven't a clue. 
Parallel bars, with which you can deduce you have no upper body strength. 
Wooden pallets adorned with small herb gardens hanging on the walls.

Lighting consists of inverted peach baskets hanging from the open rafter ceiling. 

There's a boxing ring, complete with gloves and I presume a no-fault waiver should you decide to jump in and beat the shit out of someone. There's even a bell to signal your knockout round. 

Vintage army fatigues from WW2, (the original cargo shorts) hang from the many clothing racks.
Tables are converted warehouse racks. 
And did I mention the bleachers overlooking the shuffleboard, ping pong and cornhole games? Well there are. 

On the day I visited, there was a running club pounding beers at one of the bars. At the other end of the warehouse, a wedding reception was in progress. 
The running club was really a drinking club, outfitted in running gear. They came to get hammered and haplessly jog around the block before returning to slam more brews. 
I like the concept.

In short, this has got to be one of the weirdest places in Phoenix, but I like it.
It's truly a visual extravaganza.... a feast for the eyes. 

Try this. 
Grab an Old Style and head for the bleachers where you can sit and cheer-on your favorite shuffleboard team to victory. 
Really fucking weird, but totally cool."}
{"text":"Quite a place, the first time my friend tooked me there with our group of friends was great, at first sight is kind of weird because the place is just a huge warehouse in teh middle of nowhere and it was even weirder 'cuz as we stepped inside there was like a flashmob or a class of swing with a big cordinated group of people,  decorations were kind of retro (My friend told me the place was kind of hipster, i didn't believe him, he was totally right), food is as weird as is good; kind of expensive but it totally worth it.

Walking by the place the retro/hipster athmosphere really makes the experience unique, the warehouse (Inside) is divided in 3 sections: Food court, dancefloor (With bar) and the big game area were you can find tables to eat your meal, a store with tons of cool stuff (Clothes, shoes, souvenirs, etc), ping-pong tables, and a freaking boxing ring (Really cool) and even more retro decorations (old transistor radios, 80's cafeter√≠a style), definitely a most if you're in Phoenix you'll love it."}
{"text":"Father's Day.  Place is cool, who's in charge?  Wondered around for a few mins before we asked someone for help.  Bartender was cool.  Ordering food sucked , 1 person handling taking orders and making drinks and she's in a mood.  Should have not ordered, but, Mac and cheese bites were pretty good .  Took over an hour for slider and not busy?  Sliders....  under cooked, bread hard as can be, 0 taste.  Place is super cool but food and service suck.  Common guys you can do better.  

Talked to the manager before pasting this, i showed her all the food we didn't eat.  I pointed out how hard the bread is that you can't even bite it, she said yeah we get that a lot..  and you still serve it?  I was told I could get a desert.  I passed.   

I'm guessing management must have been here when the dude from dinnners and drive in must have been here cause there's no pride in the food or customer service."}
{"text":"This was my second attempt to go to Duce.  The first time we didn't check before we went and turns out they are closed on Monday's - not their fault.  We finally made it for lunch and it was great.  The atmosphere is really cool, the retail space is way over priced but its on par with Anthropologie and people seem to like to shop there.  I like the concept of the entire space and its very different than the 8,000 Subway's that are Downtown and accessible at lunchtime.  

The patio area was great, I went just two weeks ago and there were plenty of umbrella's and it wasn't too hot - only about 105, so it was nice to be outside.  I ordered the Meatball sliders, my friend ordered the Tuna and we shared a giant lemonade.  

It was really expensive - but anytime you are at a place that serves local & organic food and its non-corporate owned, its not going to be cheap, what was surprising were the portions.  The portions were actually quite sizeable and more than adequate, so in that respect the pricing was appropriate.  

Meatballs were really delicious, the bread was great, everything was very fresh.  My friend really like her tuna sliders.  The lemonade was actually really good, even a bit sour rather than sugary sweet, which is my preference.  

I would for sure go back for lunch and will likely hold an event here as the rest of the space is so huge. 

On a side note, my car battery died in the parking lot.  The owner came out - during the lunch hour and jumped me to get my car going again.  Pretty good customer service if you ask me."}
{"text":"A really weird place, definitely a hipster place. This really isn't a bar or a restaurant... Its more of a venue. I went with my girlfriend for her coworkers graduation party. No one had been here before, and it was very confusing. Seating, what there is, is either reservations or first come first serve. Where you would think there is seating there is theater seating with a projector and screen that drops down over a huge area dedicated to corn hole. Then there are ping pong tables, fooseball, and a clothing store. If you want to get food there is a back patio that has an old streamlight trailer that has been converted to a kitchen. Their beer selection is awful. You can choose between pabst, miller high life, shlitz, coors, and a few others. We asked a bartender how this works and was told to go to the trailer to order food and that they would call out name, anywhere in the building. We were at the furthest part in the building from the kitchen and after about 30-40 minutes and not hearing any names called I went to check on our food. When I explained to the guy that I did hear our name called and was checking in he acted annoyed that we didn't pick-up our food when he called our name. Needless to say by this point our food was cold. I got the bacon Mac & cheese muffins, because they were sold out of the regular ones, I guess they aren't made fresh if one with fewer ingredients are sold out. I was unimpressed with the ball of Mac & cheese with bacon bits in it. The burger sliders I ordered didn't have enough meat on them to overlap the mini buns. This place is so weird, the floor plan has no thought put into it. I forgot to mention there is a boxing ring in there too. Everyone is bumping unto each other because the few tables (for the size of place) are already taken (I was told 1.5hrs to get a table). The music was so loud we had to scream to talk to each other. I absolutely hated this place but if you are into the hipster scene and want to do all kinds activities besides eat and drink (the lines are ridiculous and we had people try to cut us) then I guess this place might be for you. The only reason I'm giving more than one star is the DJ played good music."}
{"text":"The food is terrible, worst dinner I've had in a while and it takes forever to come out. Atmosphere is pretty cool minus the thrift shop in the middle."}
{"text":"The Duce is a truly majestic place. If there's a place even remotely like The Duce in Los Angeles, then I need to know about it, RIGHT NOW. Please? 

Their whole set up is unconventional, which I love. Confusing, but wonderful. I'm rooting on their team for sure. 

Where else can you watch a guy practice boxing in a real boxing ring, shop for vintage goodies, sit on wooden bleachers your grandparents probably sat on in high school, buy a pie from a pie bar, get a soda pop from a soda bar, order your food from a trailer AND eat an out-of-this-world brunch, all in the same building. That's incomparable folks! 

Let's talk about their brunch. Fresh squeezed OJ? Divine. Cinnamon pecan french toast? Count me in! A bowl of fresh fruit? You'll never have to ask me twice. But the egg sliders? That's some crazy deliciousness goin' on right there. My sunnies are off to whoever came up with that idea. You did my stomach right and I wish I could shake your hand(s). 

I'll definitely be hanging out at The Duce when I'm in Phoenix again. Until then, I'll be recommending this place to every. single. person. I. know."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, last place I'd go for food or drink.

Went in last night with friends. I got there a few minutes early and waited 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar. It's great that they fresh squeeze the juices but that leads to long service times, at least with flow last night. It doesn't help that one cash register was not in service and only one credit card machine. I saw the bartenders spending a lot of time waiting to do a transaction.

Next, take a look at their mason jar glasses - ALL of them are cloudy from not being properly cleaned. My drink tasted like the last person's drink. How do I know? Scotch does not taste like fruit juice. I paid $13 for that drink, before tip.

Later, I got another round and paid $9.75 for the same drink. Don't know why they would charge two different prices but that's a risk that occurs for restaurants using cash registers vs. point of sale machines.

Food - 30-40 minute wait time last night after ordering. I can't make heads or tails from this menu. Essentially, there's almost no side dishes. Lots of food served in jars. More gimmicks than substance.

The entrees are served in wicker baskets with liners. These are not food safe - the baskets will absorb food, grease, etc from being stacked on top of each other (like when we put them at the end of the table because apparently no one ever busses the dirty glasses or baskets from tables). When you carry your food out your hands could be in contact with bacteria that can't go away between uses due to the nature of wicker. They cannot be sanitized.

I like the free valet, the fun (un-airconditioned) place to socialize, the creative drink menu but I can't see going back here."}
{"text":"Always has a great energy and a happy crowd of folks - lots of good juju.  DJ is usually pretty decent and keeps the music mix flowing enough to keep everyone's attention."}
{"text":"Great venue, really well appointed, perfect for big events but a bit too quiet on our other visits.  

We most recently went there for the Pancakes and Booze Art show, which was lots of fun and drew a nice crowd.  The art was pretty interesting, and the music (though totally blaring in one section of the show), was pretty fun.  The place was lit up beautifully and offered tons of places to grab a seat or grab some drinks/food.

When we've eatern there, the food was pretty decent - the breakfast sliders are simple and tasty, and they sometimes have pie from Rock Springs - try any cream pie!  

So, why the 3 stars?  The parking sitation is atrocious unless there's literally no one else there.  For the event, they had complimentary valet, but my friend's car was blocked in and they parked it somewhere they didn't have a right to call a tow truck.  They also handled the situation badly by not addressing it for like 30 minutes.  

Aside from the time we were there for an event, the place has a tendency to feel like a really cool ghost town.  The food and drinks are dispersed at different counters around the vast place, and those counters are often closed or unmanned.  The pie counter was closed a few times (if you're there and it's open, try any cream pie - they're from Rock Springs and they're yummy).  

Although there is lots of cool stuff everywhere, the merchandise is painfully overpriced (so not a great shopping spot at all).  

Overall, a super cool idea with just ok execution.  I am hoping to go to more events here!"}
{"text":"Tried calling to make a pick up order but kept ringing and ringing. Looked forward to giving this place a try for the first time but will give them a 2 star because their hours of operation were unclear over the answering machine, strange! Better to call before hand to avoid wasting gas."}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed.  It was okay.  The atmosphere was a bit strange, I felt.  The building seems to be in the middle of nowhere (well, \"nowhere\" meaning the dark and dingy outskirts of the city, where streets are unlit and homeless folk meander around, where I would be afraid to park my car along a side street and especially afraid to walk by myself from said side street to building...).  While my husband drove around to find parking, my friends filled me in on the complimentary valet situation.  We wouldn't have known otherwise; it really wasn't clearly visible on the signage, if it was stated at all (not sure).  

The building itself is huge, and therefore seemed empty.  Bright fluorescent lighting and retail clothing displays are not really my personal idea of a fun, party atmosphere...it was a bit odd.  But the other side, where drinks are served, was more fun.  Drinks were good, the mason jar theme was quirky and unique.  The music being played was alright, but nothing to get me racing over to the dance floor over.  (Backstreet Boys, anyone..?)  I didn't order food, but partly due to the fact that everyone warned me it would take nearly an hour to get it.  (Really..?)  And the valet situation at the end of the night was absurd.  We waited in line for at least 20 minutes before asking for our keys and walking to get the car ourselves.  That's what you get when the service is free, I supposed.  

I'd say the main reason I had fun there was the people we were with.  Maybe I just don't get the whole downtown Phoenix thing...not really my scene.  Guess I'm not one of the hipsters, but I'm okay with that.  Although I'd go again if that's where the group wanted to go, I probably wouldn't otherwise."}
{"text":"I have a lot issues with this place. I want to like it. Prob good as a bar.  The food concept interesting obviously why it was on ddd. But no excuse to have cold sliders. And three dollars for an 8 ounce diet coke that was warm. After waiting half hour for the food I obviously drank it all.  I could go on. They need to work on how the place is run.  Also no ac its basically outside so avoid in summer. I'll leave my complaints here I don't want to be too harsh I just didn't enjoy my experience at all."}
{"text":"Super cool, vintage, UNIQUE. I LOVEd the vibe, decor and pretty much everything about this place. Attended an art show tonight. Pass on their potato chips, super oily and burnt. Requested a replacement for something else equivalent and was suggested the corn appetizer. Believe it or not took over 40 minutes to receive it. I didn't realize it was just a little ear of corn and during my visit it was fairly slow. High rating with the ambiance and everything else that made up for it including their brisket sliders. My friend had the Vienna Dog? He said it was very good. I would say PASS on the mojito drink and the potato crisp chips."}
{"text":"The Duce is a special place, indeed.  My friend took me here when I visited from Austin and we had a blast!  The place is big enough to just kick back and relax with good conversation but there is so much more to this place.  For one, the games.  They have a whole range of retro games that anyone can play like foosball, hula hoops, sandbag/bean toss, ping pong (where were the balls?), etc.  There is a bunch of old school exercise equipment with which you can mess around as well.

They have a dance area with great music pumping out of a solid sound system.  They also sell shirts and stuff.  

The drinks are phenomenal.  They make everything from scratch - including freshly squeezed fruit.  We got a Greyhound.  It had a double shot of vodka and freshly squeezed grapefruit.  It was one of the best ever.  We also got an adult milkshake.  Same thing - one of the best ever.  Most of their drinks are stiff ones (though you wouldn't know it) so be ready!  Their beer selection is composed of almost all old-school beers like Old Style so this is not the place is you are all about craft beer.

We got the mac n' cheese muffins to nibble on.  They were worth checking out.  I wouldn't go crazy over them myself but that is just my preference.  I can see their allure.  They have a bunch of sliders that looked interesting.  I will have to have them next time around.

All in all, this is a place to go if you want to have fun.  If you want a place to sit and quietly sip cocktails then don't come here.  But if you want to get a little goofy, drink some amazing cocktails, have some interesting food, and just enjoy spending time with your friends and making new ones then this is the place.  Truly a gem in the Phoenix scene, or any scene for that matter."}
{"text":"Took a customer to lunch here. The gal at the order desk was great. The place is really different. Unfortunately the lunch was horrible. Disappointed and over priced."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for The Duce any earlier. I've been here several times for the past four years or so and I've always enjoyed myself. 

During the evenings, there are so many things to do. You can play corn hole, eat food from a permanent food truck, Dance, hula hoop, shop. There are a few places that I can name that can do all these things. 

During one Saturday or Sunday morning, I had a yoga class there and there was an awesome brunch after. At the end of the yoga class, a group of people were taking boxing lessons. Yes, there is a boxing ring here. I think this is the only place I've danced and hula hooped next to a boxing ring.

My most recent visit to the Duce was a couple of weekends ago when my group of friends was doing a 24 hour adventure challenge Questival race. Some of the challenges involved strangers and so we knew we'd find fun people willing to participate along with us to complete the challenges. One of the challenges was to do a hula hoop contest with a stranger. Well, my friend Laura won the hula hoop contest that The Duce hosted that evening while we were there!! It was amazing! We also had to challenge someone to a dance off. We met so many people with unique dancing skills! We had soooo much fun!! The Duce is such a cool venue! I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Pit stop before the Suns game seats at the effen vodka lounge. This place is pretty interesting not boring at all."}
{"text":"Service Quality: The Service quality is spectacular.  They have friendly staff members throughout Duce. 

Atmosphere: The atmosphere of Duce is to watch you would consider \"old school\". If your looking for something more towards the country side of things then you'll enjoy it. The parking lot is kinda of unique, in other words it kind of packed. 

Pricing: In my personal opinion the prices of the food, beverages, and clothing are very expensive if your on a budget. If you are someone that can afford to splurge in life then it's gonna be a blast.  

Other: The music selection isn't to my needs and the targeted preferred customer would probably lean more towards \"southern\" or \"country\". It's a cool place to hang out with friends though."}
{"text":"Time for someone to tell the truth about the Duce. Before today, even I had given it 3 stars because I wanted to give it a chance. No more.

The Duce gets one star for numerous reasons: 

1. In an effort to be retro-cool, its beer list is comprised exclusively of crap you would drink at a dive bar in Chicago, in the 1970s. And I can appreciate that, and even favor it. But at least offer us a choice. This is the American West. Many of us will drink PBR once in our lifetimes for kicks, conclude that it tastes like carbonated piss (which it absolutely does), and promptly go back to our Kiltlifters and Fat Tires. 

2. I live in the neighborhood, just blocks away from Chase Field. I am 100% judgmental of baseball fans who live here but cheer for any visiting team, and rest assured that I'm in very good company as a downtowner. Anyone in tune with how our city works knows that this is a major pet peeve of its long-time residents. So, I can only conclude that the Duce is out of tune with us on this point, too: it advertises itself as a venue friendly to *another* team in the National League that I refuse to name here. Strike 2.

3. A friend texted me not too long ago to say that he and his girlfriend were in my neighborhood to check out the Duce on a Saturday morning, and would I care to join them for breakfast? Before I could answer, I got another text: \"wtf! It's closed!\" The Duce has horrendous, laughable hours. Right now it doesn't even bother opening on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays at all. On the 4 days of the week it's open, it still shuts down at 10 pm on two of them, and even earlier on Sunday. Therefore, I have no reason to go there to enjoy what should be the cool bar scene. (Setting aside its atrocious beer selection.) 

As much as I initially liked the concept of the Duce as described by its owners in the media, it has been poorly executed from what I've seen so far. Get rid of the anti-Dbacks status, create a better bar situation for people to enjoy in terms of drink selection and hours, and it might stand a chance in the long run."}
{"text":"Our party of 8 (5 adults, 3 teens) visited on a recent Saturday afternoon. Visually, it is an incredibly interesting place for all ages with lots of fun activities. It's kinda like a playground on steroids. And loud! Food was good, but we had to wait 2 1/2 hours for it after we placed our order. Cool idea to have the kitchen in a trailer; might consider adding another one! When we finally did get our food, not everyone's order was ready at the same time; we ate in shifts. After a while, the place cleared out a bit but the staff was in no hurry to clear off and clean tables (place looked like a war zone). We had been wanting to visit The Duce for a while but it was a disappointment. A return visit is doubtful."}
{"text":"The Duce is an ultra-eclectic joint that's part store, part bar and restaurant and part work-out center. Yep, there's a massive boxing ring surrounded by handmade cooking aprons overlooking the bar, with the venue taking space in a old spacious warehouse.

The energy at The Duce is interesting, with a decidedly retro vibe coming through both the vintage handmade cocktails and the fashionable finds throughout the store, including cruiser bicycles.

The cocktail menu is full of handcrafted drinks, ranging from dirty martinis to grapefruit mimosas.

You can enjoy your drinks on the patio, which also includes an organic produce stand, or in the bar, with simple long tables and some retro furniture filling it up.

Live music takes place on the makeshift stage, which doubles as the boxing ring. When I was there last night, lights were strung up to light up the platform, which was surrounded by old school punching bags and giant tires. When we first arrived to the mixer and sat down to drink, I noticed a trainer and his client doing shoulder presses. It was one of the quirkiest places I've experienced.

And that's why The Duce is so charming. You can wander around and check out the unique finds throughout the space, you can enjoy good food and drinks (I heard the noodle kugel, $4 off the small American menu, was amazing), you can work out, or you can listen to live music. There's also a Chicago soda fountain, and on top of everything else, The Duce hosts ice cream socials and birthday parties.

I'd definitely like to go back during the day some time for brunch, though their brunch menu is served all day long. I bet sitting on the patio in the sun would give a whole different feel to the place, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time in there, was a bigger group in front of us so we knew it was going to be a little bit longer. Chelsie and Alexis were helping us in food faves and directed us to the games while we waited. Mac and cheese bites were awesome and brisket. Great service and such friendly employees will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with my description of the Duce. I guess I will start with my first impression. 

I learned about the Duce about a year ago so decided to stop by and check it out. I drove to an industrial area of Downtown Phoenix behind the stadiums and found myself at an old warehouse claiming to be The Duce. I parked in a tiny parking lot and walked through what looked like use to be an old garage door entrance. As I entered, I didn't even know where to begin looking! It's filled with every fun and quirky element around. There are small pods owned by different vendors who sell things like vintage college attire, natural products like soap and lotions, locally made jewelery and yes, even items like vintage beach cruisers. They have a huge vintage boxing ring in the middle along with other antique workout gear that's still able to be used (and it is used!). To the left, they recently brought in the famous Rock Spring Pies! You've GOT to try one if you haven't yet. They melt in your mouth. Especially the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie. Then to the right lives a garage-like restaurant with great drink specials, a picnic/backyard atmosphere with a large patio and they host a variety of special events and live music throughout the year. 

This spot is definitely cool and worth checking out many times over again."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to this place!

Came here on a weekday early evening, so there were not many people.  

What a great place to come hang out! So much to do and see!

We ordered the family sliders that came with 7 of our choice! I, being the only girl volunteered to only eat one and let the two guys I was with have 3 each.  I quickly regretted that after trying the first bite of my burger slider.  SO DELICIOUS! I don't know what sauce they put on it, but my taste buds LOVED it!

I tried the meatball slider, it was average but the bbq one was great as well!

We also got the mac and cheese bites, which were very good, but semi overrated.  

For dessert, I got the smores shake, and loved every bit of it.  

My boyfriend got the pecan pie and it was way too sweet for me, but still yummy.  

I would love to try their breakfast foods and cheese cake next time! 

See ya soon!"}
{"text":"This place was super cool!!!! 
The minute you pull up you know your in for a good time. I had two awesome alcoholic beverages (forgive me because i dropped the ball and forgot the names of them) one was a minty drink the other strawberry. There is a food truck outside so we ordered mac and cheese muffins. The young lady working asked me for my unique nickname so hello Curly Sue was the name i gave :) 
We came on a good day they were hosting an art show called Pancake and Booze. overall a very fun place to go to! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the trendy top of the town place right now in Phoenix. For me, the food is easily a 4 star or even 4.5 star product but in other places they just fall short here if you are looking for a complete package. 

Whatever you do, don't make plans that need to happen after you are dining here. I debated writing a review about this wondering if my delay was a one off but clearly others Yelpers have seen this same problem that they cannot seem to clean up or address. It probably took us 20 minutes to order and about 70 minutes for mac n cheese in a jar and a burger show up.

Food was quality like I said and parking here is also a headache, they do have valet which is nice to solve that problem. Would probably come back again abut need to have a good amount of time to not be in a hurry and just hang out when I show up."}
{"text":"Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!"}
{"text":"I passed this place one night while leaving Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and thought it looked like a cool spot. One of my Meetup groups was having an event there so I decided to go check it out. 

This converted warehouse has a vintage clothing store, bar, dance floor, boxing ring, and food truck. I went on a Saturday night and the DJ was great. He played hits from the 90s to current hits. Later in the evening the DJ opened the floor up for anyone wanting to sing karaoke. He had pretty much any song you would want to sing. 

I decided to try the brisket sliders because everyone on Yelp was raving about them. They came out quickly so I was happy because other Yelpers said service was slow. Unfortunately, the sliders didn't taste too good and were cold. They do serve Miller High Life so I guess that made up for the cold brisket. Who doesn't love the Champagne of Beers? Their mixed drinks looked great. I didn't partake but my friends said they were tasty. 

I would certainly come again as I had a great time. I just think next time will be for drinks,dancing and karaoke."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place, everything from the drinks and food, to the music and decor are all old time classics. 

I went with a friend to their Tuesday night Swing Dancing lesson. Everyone was very friendly and encouraging, some music was contemporary rehashed in a swing style which was fun! I hope to visit again soon, and definitely recommend it for a night out of the ordinary.

Drinks are served in different sized mason jars, which add to the atmosphere even though prices have inflated a little since the 50s."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place! The outside was so cute, great bar and patio...the inside got a little confusing with a boxing ring and...shopping? 

The drinks: fine, good even, but way overpriced at $12 for weak margaritas. 

The food: atrocious. My brisket sliders were 50% fat, my potato \"chips\" were soggy and the Mac n cheese muffins were in desperate need of flavor. 

Also in a really shady neighborhood. Yikes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and danced the night away! The Duce is so much fun. Here's what you need to know:
-Huge open place, used to be an old boxing gym
-Cool, funky decor. Reminded me of a picnic in the 50s
-Quality, yet inexpensive drinks
-Its an all-ages venue but the dancefloor area is SUPPOSED to be 21+. I wonder how/if this is actually regulated
-Fun DJ playing a wide variety of dance-worthy music
-Good crowd 
-Big game area with foosball, bags, and more

Will definitely be back for a good time"}
{"text":"The number one thing is no air conditioning in the middle of Phoenix the food was good we had the brisket sliders very good the hamburger sliders okay the macaroni and cheese biscuits!!  The store was filled with high-priced old clothes over $100 for a shirt without a hood all the clothes in the store were very expensive. Ice-T is three dollars for an unrefillable pint jar. Overall I would give it to an a  2 &
half stars it was very hot inside and lots of flies a ...The flies are really gross."}
{"text":"I have no idea how long this place has been open but it is fantastic.  I went with the Phoenix Social Group from Facebook a few weeks ago.  It is a really fun and cool environment.  The outside area is spacious with lots of kitsch to to look at.  Outside and inside bar.  The drinks were a little pricey but the bartenders were very friendly and attentive.  I would love to go back soon.  A great place to bring a large group of friends."}
{"text":"Our daugther and son-in-law had their wedding reception at the Duce this past weekend.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a unique venue. It fit perfectly for their 50s retro themed wedding.  The staff is awesome, the food was great, the venue is amazing and so much fun.  Thank you Steve, Ellen and Staff for a very memorable night!  All the guests raved about what a wonderful place it was.  Much success to you!"}
{"text":"SO glad I checked this place out!  Awesome, fun atmosphere.  You DO order at a stand and then have to wait for your food.  However, the environment is so cool you won't care. Mac & Cheese muffins were definitely amazing!  Staff was fun."}
{"text":"Really its a 2 1/2 just not deserving enough of a 3

The good: 

The place itself is pretty rad and eccentric!
The lemonade is soo yumny and perfect on a hot summer day! 
The sliders are tasty and flavors are inviting. 
Family friendly.

The bad:

My chips were completely burnt and i mean they looked more like charcoal than sweet potato chips. 
I took them back and was promised a new set, which i never got so i pretty much gave away my money. 
That alone threw me off. 
The cups offered  for water were dirty.
the water was hot. for their prices atleast some ice and lemon wedges would be nice.

Customer service was ok other than not bringing me my darn chips. 

I would go give it another try for the heck of the sliders and lemonades but it will be a while."}
{"text":"Give 4 stars cause took way too long to get my food. I had the famous chicken pot pie in a jar and the Mac n cheese bites. Both great!
U also have to try the strawberry bruschetta... Mmmm good!!"}
{"text":"Finally a Place to dance and have fun.  The music and the vibe was great.  Not too heavy on hip hop - thank you - little bit of everything.  
Yes there is a lot going on here, but the place is awesome.  You could spend all day here just hanging out.  Though I was confused about the boxing ring?"}
{"text":"Whether you're a resident of the Phoenix area or just here for a few days, The Duce should definitely be on your list of places to venture to. They offer a unique experience that is fostered by an open concept floor plan. They have a wide variety of games and other activities to partake in and the selection of music is very eclectic so everyone can find something to dance to. The food and drinks are amazing and not outrageously priced."}
{"text":"I've not had so much fun in a long time. The games, great mix of music, delicious drinks, eclectic interior design, this place has it all."}
{"text":"Love this place when it's not summer.  It's a converted building (used to be a boxing gym back when buildings were built of chewing tobacco, brick and fear) so it is hot.  There is no cool air circulating in the place.  Food is tasty (sliders, fried mac and cheese) etc.  But really just come for the cocktails.  It's nice to have another place that takes pride in it's mixers.  They make their own lemonade, they steep some of their own liquors.  More importantly, they make one of the best grey hounds I've ever had in this town.   Granted it's a little far south and can get warm, but the good news is, you can come on over, pretend that you aren't an aging hipster and order a few cocktails that will remind you of why it is you still work that 9-5 job."}
{"text":"I was in need of a joint that was somewhat close and offered karaoke on a Thursday night.  I had heard about this place from friends, and watched the DDD episode a few years ago.  I hadn't yet gone due to the reports of the long waits for service and higher than average prices.

The valet service is nice since the parking there is tricky, the fellas were friendly and quick when we arrived.  I walked in and immediately was entertained by the idea that people go to The Duce and spend $120 on a pair of sweat pants, which are for sale in the boutique near the front entrance.

Next we wandered over to the bar and realized we had infiltrated a private party, to which we were immediately invited to leave.  Walked past the boxing ring, which I find both awesome and bizarre, and on to the karaoke area.

Immediately I noticed that the other folks there were better than average, which I'll be honest kind of intimidated me.  I ordered a couple of drinks, they were about $10 each and come in a decent sized mason jar.  

After I had a few sips, the prices made sense and I had zero buyers remorse (which happens from time to time whenever you're spending double digits on a freaking drink).  The servers were as quick as they could be, as crafting handmade artisan cocktails isn't necessarily easy!

The dj was cranky, but he warmed up to us after a while, and we all had a great time drinking and singing until the place closed down.  I didn't get to experience the food, or any of the other random and cool things there, but I did have a great time, and would recommend coming on a school night to avoid the big crowds and long waits."}
{"text":"4 stars for this spot as a bar/hang out spot to come with friends, but 2 stars for their desserts. The Duce is an interesting hipster/eclectic space where you can eat, drink, and also play games (ping pong, fooze ball, corn hole, hula hoop). They even have a boxing ring available on the weekends! We came in on a Thursday night at 10pm, and it wasn't very busy at that time. Their parking lot is really small, so they have mandatory valet. From what I could see, there isn't much street parking available. We already had dinner before coming, but decided to order dessert since they had cakes to choose from. We tried:

-Hot Vanilla Cake (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BrzfsBWAmpAuXIerY9DMuw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uuOzYCOMHhbASGwMETqNdA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Way too sweet, and the cake was really dense and not at all moist. Skip!
-S'mores Cheesecake (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CJ4wTEKLmiY5qd5q-APXnw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cLAUFBbK6zX3Hu3AqfItvw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok. I liked the torched marshmallow on top but the s'mores flavor didn't really integrate well as a cheesecake. I wouldn't get this again. 

We spent a couple of hours playing the games here. This is a giant space so it's nice that you can walk around and go to different areas. I would come back for the games and to hang out, and give their food a try, but just pass on the cakes."}
{"text":"What The Duce!?

For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasn't sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area that's when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!   

We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.  

I enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of it's odd ball nature.  It's definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Duce never fails to impress. The Mac and Cheese Bites, the Short Rib Sliders and the Meatball Sliders are a few of their best. All guaranteed to give you that you Ratatouille movie moment with a single bite. Do your mouth a favor and go there now."}
{"text":"After flying in to Phoenix, my friend picked me up and suggested we head over to the Duce. I had never been there before and got there around 10:30pm on a Tuesday night. By the time we got there the crowd had thinned out but there were a few stragglers dancing and having a good time. The decor is decidedly retro in a good way. There are ping pong tables, shuffleboard, a boxing ring and corn hole to be played. I think they serve food too but we apparently arrived too late to sample their wares. They do have a full bar though and that seemed to be the draw for many people. If I get in to town earlier next time I will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"Let's start at the top, the drinks are outstanding.  There's no other place to get a 24ish ounce jar of Old Fashioned that was perfect for two people, and not just the volume was impressive, the drink itself was top notch.  Followed by some cranberry drink with enough vodka to knock out a horse, but tasted like I was drinking straight juice, very well done.  For food we ordered three items off the menu, all were good, but the surprising star in the food category was the home made chips.  No doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been a patron of.  If you give it any less than 5/5 stars then you hate things that America stands for!  

The decor is awesome!  The food is served out of an old airstream trailer named dutchess.  It seems like everything around is collected from local thrifts.  It's mainly retro and hodgepodge.  There is a boxing ring you can step into and a store as well.  They do different events on different nights to include swing dancing, boxing, old school workouts.    

The food is spectacular!  There is a wide range of sliders, salads and drinks.  They have salads and shareable dishes to include Mac n cheese muffin bites and chicken pot pie in a mason jar.  All the drinks are served out of mason jars as well.  They have 16oz jars and 32oz jars if you're looking for a little more liquid courage.  

Give this place a shot!  You won't be let down.  They do group events and functions and can be reserved for just about anything.  So cool!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't awesome, it's an order on your own at the food truck or bar and pick up your own order. No waiters or waitresses. But the vibe is awesome. Nice mix of people. Awesome music (old school 90s, 80s,70s, etc). Karaoke was super fun. All in all a great time. Also the drinks are awesome :-)"}
{"text":"My friends & I came here Friday night after going to the river. The Duce is right near the Diamondbacks' stadium, so we were able to see fireworks as we pulled into the parking lot.

This restaurant/bar is cute! It's in a former warehouse, partially outdoors with the metal sliding doors wide open. It doesn't get hot inside as there was a giant fan. 

The streamline trailer dished out eats, and the drinks were served in Mason jars. Everything is made from scratch, and drinks use fresh squeezed juice. There was a dance floor, karaoke, boxing rink, hula hoops, soda fountain. It was random, it was retro, it was cool!"}
{"text":"Eclectic decor provides an awesome atmosphere. It's something that Phoenix seems to lack, that rustic feel. A contrast from all the new and modern decor bars and lounges that scatter the area. There's definitely something inside that will catch your eye and worthy of an instagram post. It's a large open space that is nicely sectioned into smaller areas by clever placement of bars and yard games and patio space. 

My only complaint is the prices of drinks seems pretty steep for even some of the most simple cocktails. Ginger and whiskey came out to be a little over $9."}
{"text":"Loved it.   Food came out in a reasonable time.  Person taking orders was friendly and helpful for first time eating there.  Mac and Cheese Muffins  are fantastic."}
{"text":"I just happened to watch the TRIPLE D SHOW featuring the Duce...whow..the chicken pot pie I had barely resembled the one shown on Triple D...my crust..was raw and the pie barely had any ingredients..along with chicken scraps...wow..Guy was rooked and so was I...could not believe what I was seeing...just not the same at all"}
{"text":"Talk about a great time!! Went here on Saturday night for my birthday and I  was immediately impressed by the whole place. They offer corn hole, ping pong, and other fun games, an awesome dance floor, but better yet.... The drinks! Dan, the best bartender in the world, took great care of myself and my entire group. He was a mastermind behind that bar. All the employees are extremely friendly and involved, but Dan and David stood out the most. The only downside was how hot it was.. But hey it's the middle of July. We ended up eventually leaving due to the heat, but found ourselves wanting to go back that night after other bars just didn't measure up. The Duce is awesome and I want to thank Dan and David for making my 21st birthday so special!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I didn't want to do this.  I had a bad night there for St. Patrick's Day, but I gave it another shot for Mothers Day brunch.  This is not the same Duce I first stepped foot into two years ago.  Defrosting cheesecake is not the same as last years Rock Spring Pie, and last but not at all least YOU DO NOT SERVE ALCOHOL IN CUPCAKES TO KIDS!  Even worse, with out them marked as containing alcohol, I sent my poor mother who is in recovery and allergic to alcohol, to go ahead and eat one!  This was the worst experience yet at the Duce.  It is just not the same place it use to be.  At 20 dollars a head for brunch, I could not even find juice and had to pay for lemonades at the bar.  So for the second time this year, I spent too much money for mediocre drinks and bad cheesecake.  The sliders and fruit bread were dried out.  I am soo disappointed, I loved this place at first.  When a show turns a bad corner, they say it has jumped the shark.  Well I am sad to report that the Duce has definitely jumped the shark."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the week and was so glad we came here! The food was fantastic and the drinks amazing! Highly recommend the bacon Mac and cheese muffins, chicken pot pie and the amazing s'mores cheesecake (to share). The black and blue mojito was tasty as well. 
Love love the games and atmosphere! Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Very funky place. 
I'd been wanting to check it out for some time and took the opportunity last week.
Was surprised to find it fairly empty on a Sunday Funday afternoon. There were maybe 8 guests...it was a bit odd.
My girl and I took some time to explore, and finally made our way to the trailer to order some food.
Staff was very friendly. We had a tuna melt and a Chicago dog. Though the tuna was good, it was not what I expected in that it was in a hoagie roll and so was not a melt in the traditional sense. The bread was dry and crunchy. It'd have been nice to have this information beforehand. So, good but disappointing. The dog was good. We also had corn which was good.

Additionally we grabbed Bloody Mary's at a bar stand. Very full of stuff but the mix was especially bitter, or vinegary. I am not a fan. Another quirky disappointment that might best to be explained to newbies, which I proclaimed.

Also, valet parking for an empty parking lot? No thanks. 

I enjoyed some of the quirks, but would've preferred a more traditional tuna melt and bloody mary or would at least have liked to be told otherwise.

Meh."}
{"text":"Very interesting establishment.  Not a lot of parking but they do have valet.  We walked in to a very large space.  There was a gift shop to one side, boxing ring straight ahead and lots and lots of tables.  Very eclectically decorated.  It was a bit overwhelming.  From the initial space, there was a dance floor and bar, beyond that here where tables and the places to order outside. The ordering process was confusing.  We needed to go outside to order and wait to hear our name called. The music was loud and made it difficult to hear. I don't know how that would work out if they were really busy. The food was good. The alcoholic drinks were excellent. If the ordering process were clear, music at a reasonable level and parking situation better, they would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"Saturday night. Drink was ok. Bartender slapped a 27% tip on there. Signed for it then realized it later - not pleased, considering I was at a bar counter and not seated. C'mon. Drink was so so. Parking is a pain. Was here only because a friend's farewell gathering was here. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Great fun place to go with a group.  We loved the fruit filled drinks and the ping pong!"}
{"text":"You will either love it or hate it. 

Awesome old fashion drinks

Awesome decor and history

Not your daily radio top hit remixed music. They play all kinds....I mean Nsync and Journey. 

Just try it out....will be warm during summer time."}
{"text":"I too was at the Duce during the latest wine walk.  We were also told that there was no happy hour even though the sign out front clearly indicated there was one.  Tried to get s drink from the bar but it was chaos.  Ended up outside at the beer cart. 
There seemed to be enough folks working the bar but they did not have their act together.  I seriously doubt that I will ever see the inside of this place again.  After listening to the recorded voice message, I guess the owner does not care anyways.  Must be nice to be that independent."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Phoenix after reading about it from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. What a fun place! My boys loved playing all the games-ping pong,  corn hole, connect 4-while waiting on the food. Lemonade was excellent, as were the Mac and cheese bites and chicken pot pie. The Shepards Pie was also good, although a little hard to dig down past the green lease at first. Great music and a super nice and fun staff made for an all around good time. So glad we went!"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon and some friends insisted on visiting the Deuce since I haven't been there before. We made the trek across town and showed up to what appeared to be a large hangar on the outskirts of downtown. I didn't know exactly what to expect, as my friends had given me an eclectic array of things that happened there.
Little did I know that they were right.

We walked in after the Valet took the car, and I took a look around. The high rafters of this place made it quite spacious, the decor was a bit of everything. There is a boxing ring for fight nights, some trendy distressed looking stuff and a place to purchase their Tee shirts, which have some smart quotes and sayings on them. 

We wandered around the corner, and Lo! A bar!... But it was Sunday and we needed food before beverages. In the courtyard is a food truck, and we ordered Ribs, sliders and some other stuff. The Ribs were delicious, the Barbecue sauce was sweet and tasty. The sliders were not as good, but they were still tasty. To finish lunch off we had some mixed cocktails.

I enjoy a good bloody mary, so I ordered one, knowing the ingredients were all fresh and 'wholesome', but it lacked a bit of spice for me. Thinking I had the solution, I added a few drops of the hot sauce to it, only to discover I way overcompensated. 

I would definitely recommend this place to bring some friends and have lunch, but I've also heard great things about this place once the sun goes down. It turns into more of a party venue, and they have boxing and burlesque on select nights, and from my friends' stories, it's an awesome time!"}
{"text":"It's a food truck, essentially. The ambience is kinda cool - eclectic & fun, there's a lot to do; ping pong tables, hula hoops, etc. but there's also kids running around, so there's that. As a food truck, I suppose it's ok, but it's WAY overpriced. We got a hotdog, meatball sliders, \"Reuben\" sliders that turned out to be a bbq beef w/cole slaw & shredded cheese, hamburger sliders, 2 lemonades, a tea & a coke - for $59! All sides are extra. No free refills on anything but tea & all soda & beer appears to be served in cans or bottles. You pay before you eat, & they ask you for either a 15% or 20% tip! You order at the counter, you pick up your food when they call you, & we waited nearly an hour from the time we ordered until our food was ready - what service exactly am I tipping for? Cocktails range $10-$13 - EACH, & shots are $7-$8. It's VERY loud, music playing constantly & loud enough to be heard inside & outside, making conversation almost impossible. Parking is almost impossible, but they do have \"complimentary\" valet service, which you also must wait for. Power is provided by several large (& loud) generators - maybe that's why the music is so loud?"}
{"text":"The cocktails here are seriously next level. The fresh fruit realllly makes a difference and it's totally worth the price! I just wish they had A/C and some better tunez"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what it was.  The food was pretty good but not great.  The ambience felt like hipsters trying to be cool and different, but it didn't quite come together for me.  Drinks were too expensive for the venue and I can't get over their abbreviation of \"Ou\" for \"ounce\".  There's already a standard abbreviation--Oz--and it doesn't sound cool or hip to use something else; it just sounds lame."}
{"text":"I love the Duce it is super fun and they have great drinks. They hold a Hulu hoop contest every Friday night where you can win a drink unless I'm there then I'm going to win the free drink. Please check the Duce remember to have a designated driver you will need it after all the hula hooping corn hole and pull ups. They have an organic produce lemonade available but unfortunately not a ton of vegan options on the food menu hopefully they will have some coming soon!"}
{"text":"The Duce is by far one of my favorite spots to visit and my go-to when showing friends around Phoenix. I mainly come on Thursdays for salsa and always have a blast.

The food is also amazing. The brisket sliders and spinach mac and cheese muffins are some of my favorites. I LOVE the s'mores cheesecake but it is way too big for just a couple people unless you have a massive sweet tooth. I would only get it if I have a large party with me. 

While the staff are friendly, the service for food can be slow at times, especially if it's a busy night.
I would recommend to order food first before doing anything else. So while you are waiting for your name to be called, you can go off dancing, hula hoop, play ping pong, or shop."}
{"text":"Rally in the Valley was in full effect for the visiting NY Mets fans part of the \"7 Line Army\" supporter group. Really excited to have been a part of this exclusive event with mostly Mets fans, pre-game festivities. The venue was a perfect selection for the amount of fans that were in the establishment, and the service offered from the staff was outstanding! How many places that serve food and drinks have a boxing ring inside...that in itself is impressive! Very wide open floor plan with ping pong tables, and other outdoor recreational games. 
As far as food I did have a classic hot dog, sprinkled with freshly cut onions. My drink was the strawberry limeade, which came with Vodka, mixed with smashed strawberries, limes, soda and agave mix. This drink was specifically refreshing for the humid day! Talk about a memorable sporting event in a cool location in downtown phoenix!"}
{"text":"The Duce was awesome!  Teenagers loved it. Food was great. Amazing atmosphere and great place to hang out with the kids. One warning, we were there in July, and it's hot!  Just dress accordingly because it's worth it. Great time!"}
{"text":"Solid four  stars for the drinks and atmosphere. A little bummed that they didn't live up to their offer on urban wine walk event . Actually, really bummed bit I'm about to give up on the walk and have a strawberry shortcake cocktail... Maybe that'll make it better. We do love the Duce!"}
{"text":"The Duce was the last stop for my last night of 39 and got their before the midnight hour forced me into the Fab & 40 club. I have never been to The Duce and had been looking forward to going.  As soon as I walked into The Duce, I was awe struck, I absolutely love this place! 

At the last stop my friends and I were at, I left a lil tipsy and was in need of some food, so when we 1st got to the Duce, 1st item of business that needed taken care of was order some food, after surveying the menu and debating on if I wanted something sweet or not, I went with the cheeseburger sliders.  Let me tell you, these were the best cheeseburger sliders I have had in a very very long time, the bread was soft, tender yet held the sliders together well, the cheese was perfectly melted over the burger, oh it was just delish!

The Duce has plenty to offer everyone, corn hole, foosball, Ping-Pong, hula hooping, dancing, singing, drinking or just chilling, The Duce has space for it all!  Only down side I have is that it's hot, but that's the Phoenix summer weather, I am sure when it's no longer summer ticket, The Duce would be rocking! I am looking forward to coming back and playing some games for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here twice. The first time was not bad. Since we were the only customer, we did not really notice the speed of the service, even though it was not very attentive, we figured it was kind of the attitude of the place. Food was great though.

The second time we came back, thinking it is a decent place to get a bite and recommended to our friends to come here for lunch, was a mistake.

There was a swing dance type event, however, most people seemed to be ordering drinks. And there were lots of empty tables. So we figured that there should not be too long of a wait because we were all pretty hungry.

It took 20-30 minutes just to get someone to attend to us and take our orders at the bar. The staff taking our orders were constantly distracted and very slow.

We waited for 45 min then found out we had to go to the bar and ask for our drinks. None of them were made or served without us continuously asking about whether our order was getting made or not. 

After we finally got our drinks, we entertained ourselves at the play area that has a ping pong table and couple of other games, but after another hour, we were running out of patience.

We waited 2 hours for our food, and the last person that ordered waited 2.5 hours, which is after everyone had already finished eating. Again, the food was great, but the service was not very attentive. It did seem like they were a little under staffed for the crowd, but still... there was not a real good system for getting your food or drinks after you have ordered, especially when the music is blaring. Your \"nick name\" was called over the muffled speaker for you to either pick up or someone from the staff \"might\" bring it to you, if they know where or who you are. I'd recommend checking periodically to make sure you did not miss it if you go.

The food got 4 stars, when we finally got them but the service was so bad that I had to take two stars off. And the food was not really worth the 2-hour wait, especially when the service was really little to none during the wait. 

It really was sucky for us because we paid upfront when we ordered and even tipped, and finding out later that we weren't really going to get much service at all, we regretted that we included the tip.

My advice for this place, make sure they are not busy before you decide to go there hungry... or if you have hours to kill and not super hungry, not a bad place to hangout if you do not expect to be serviced.

I want to like this place~ Unfortunately, given this place two tries, we will not return again, due to lack of service."}
{"text":"The best Moscow Mule in town. It's gotta be ginger beer and we don't need a fancy copper mug; just give us the Duce Jar.  Two rounds will do ya good.

For what it's worth, I don't care how many rounds I have, I don't see myself ever spending $58 on a graphic tee. That's just nuts~"}
{"text":"I love the idea of The Duce and had a blast hanging out with friends here, but the service was very lacking. We had a group of 15+ people by the end of the night. a handful of us were here from 7pm- midnight. We enjoyed many handmade cocktails that were freshly muddled and served in quart size mason jars - at the tune of $15-21. But a quart does last quite a while...but is watered down by the end. One friend was trying to get the bartenders attention for a while before moving onto another bar to try to get a drink. A couple times he disappeared from his 'station' (the small bar near the food counter). We joked that we should just hop in there and make our own...but he finally came back. 

I was in the party with another reviewer who mentions our food taking an hour and a half to get ready...and after that hour and a half we still had not heard our name being called. We go to the pick up window and ask if it's ready and it's there. Freezing cold. The cook says, oh yea, that's been sitting there a while. No offer to re-make, warm it up or anything. And our group was hanging out right near the food counter. How did we miss it and why didn't they get our attention when the food was ready? I'm sure we didn't hear the name being called because it was later in the night and the DJ had started blasting music for the dance floor. A better system is in order for serving food when we have to rely on a loudspeaker that is drowned out by the dance music. 

The valet situation was horrible at the end of the night. I've been to many other downtown spots that have valet and crowds but never a line that takes 20 minutes. We finally asked for our keys and were directed to where the car was parked so we could walk and get it ourselves. 

I'll probably be back but hope The Duce can improve their service, pay more attention to paying customers and figure out the valet situation. It's not the best area so I don't want to walk a block or two on this dark, sketchy block."}
{"text":"Very random. Boxing Rink, Mason Jars and Mixologist. You have to try it to get it. Good Soild Food, Great Drinks. Alot of RANDOM FUN!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about our experience at the Duce. We searched for weeks for a good venue for our party of 650 people. We were coming in for a convention. We stumbled upon the Duce. It was absolutely perfect. 

First, the pricing we paid to rent the whole place out was very reasonable. There were bar stations set up everywhere. You literally never had to wait for a drink. If one bar was crowded, there were 6 or 7 other ones set up around the place. 

This place is huge. Some people wanted to sit and have conversation by the food truck. Some wanted to dance. Some wanted to box and play games on the other side. There was something for everyone. The hula hoop contest was a big hit. 

The DJ did a pretty good job or playing a good mix between stuff the older crowd wanted and dance music later on as the older crowd left. 

The only minor \"complaint\" I have is if you know 600+ people are showing up at the same time for a party, maybe some other way of taking orders and getting food to patrons should be worked out. The food line was long, and some people waited well over an hour to eat. And it was hard to hear the names as they were called out over the music. Bigger bathrooms would also be great. 

Other than that, everything was perfect. We've thrown many parties after conventions, and this was by far the biggest hit amongst our group. I just wish you guys had one of these in Nashville for our next party!

Bravo."}
{"text":"Too busy, this place is just not my demographic.  The music is great but it just feels like a going to a large estate sale in the Midwest where people are drinking cocktails while shopping for that eclectic item that no one else wants besides themselves.  Drinks are good, little spendy considering the vibe.  Great eye candy for me, kinda of like an old school Dr Pepper commercial, great for thirty seconds, you can look but not touch."}
{"text":"Location: Not my favorite at all!  I hate walking down here from downtown.  

Food:  Pretty tasty! I have enjoyed all that I have ordered.

Drinks: Super pricey but super delicious!  I had one of the strawberry lemonades, and a friend got the basil something drink.  They put quite a bit of produce in the drinks.   

Service: The bartender was rather friendly and interesting to chat with. Of course, the friend I was with talks to everyone, but still, it was fun! 

The concept of the Duce is a bit confusing to me. The boxing ring, rope and weights seem out of place.   Also, the clothing / goods here are rather overpriced.  

Parking:  is a pain! Meters are now not as free for as long as they were before August of 2014, and there's a teeny tiny lot near the Duce.  Walking is OK if you're with someone - but still rather sketch."}
{"text":"Fun & funky. We went there on a Sunday late afternoon, so it wasn't very crowded. I'm sure it's a MUCH different vibe at night or on the weekends. Lots of retro kitsch all over the place, in a good way. Plenty of games to play and things to see. A couple of craft beers available, but I decided to go \"ironic\" and get a Hamm's and a Schlitz. Yup, just as crappy as I ever remembered, but brought back great memories. Food was good - ribs and housemade chips, sliders and salads for friends and kids. Servers were super-friendly. My only complaint -- on a 100 degree day it gets HOT in there. Uncomfortably hot. Could really use some A/C or even some much stronger fans."}
{"text":"So far I'm not exactly impressed. I know that I should give it a few more goes until I write up my review but I just couldn't believe how rude and pushy the men were behind every single bar counter. On my birthday seriously. I could not believe it. My boyfriend had ordered me a drink n walked away because the bartender at the main bar was taking forever to make my drink until he was finished to pay for it for my bday.  The bartender finished and looked over me and asked rudely excuse me do you want a drink? I said that's the rio verde right? My boyfriend ordered that for me and then he asked me for my id and barely looked at it. Then handed it back quickly asking if I wanted to close or leave the tab open, since my boyfriend was the one stuck on his phone not paying attention I decided to close and pay for it since I did not want to be anywhere near that damn bar before I blew a fuse. I've had it with rude people and the second bar guy near the bar close to the kitchen was rude as well when we were trying to leave. Which I refuse to get into because the bartenders were just ungodly rude and I personally don't want to go back but my boyfriend says he will only go back for the drinks since we can make the food so much better than what we tried. We tried the brisket and short ribs sliders and were kind of disgusted in a way because they lacked flavor along with the Mac and cheese muffins since my home made Mac and cheese is amazing.

If I were to return would be some kind of nonsense because my boyfriend would like drinks. I would not enjoy being in the establishment to say the least."}
{"text":"This place has it all!  Pot Pie. Mac and cheese muffins. Sliders. A boxing ring. Table tennis. Bleachers. Clothing store. Outside sitting. Great staff!!!  Wow!!!  Go there now!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food but not worth the wait....very slow to take your order and excruciatingly slow to get food out.  Even a slightly slow lunch crowd"}
{"text":"It was a friend's birthday outing and they chose this spot. I was a little skeptical of course because out of all the years I've lived in Phoenix, I've never heard of this place. They have self parking and valet there. I suggest valet though because some of my friends got tickets that night. Walked in and I think there was a private party going on in one end. 

Then, we walked over to the other side. I noticed a boxing ring in there and that was different, lol. There was a dancing area, had their own little DJ booth, and even corn hole. Also, a ping pong table and two bars, random to be, but I really enjoyed it! You served your own water too at the water station, lol. If you were hungry they had it to where it was a food truck style place. Some variety on the menu. I was bummed out because they ran out of pot pie. I settled with some sliders. I had the brisket and meatball. Those were pretty good!  Some of us also shared an alcoholic beverage in a big jug. I forgot the name of the drink, but that did not disappoint either!

It was really a chill spot. Everything was roomy, i felt relaxed, and most importantly there was just plenty of diversity there. A cool thing about it was that when you order you HAVE TO provide a nickname so that the DJ can call you on the mic when you food is ready! Speaking of the DJ, a lot of oldies, but every song was just the right kind of song because of how the mood was there. Chilled and relax. Should be back here for some drinks soon."}
{"text":"The Duce offers the right vibe for everyone. We got there a little early so it was still kid friendly. The yard games and plenary of places to sit made for a unique and comfortable backyard environment. I ordered a vodka lemonade with their fresh squeezed juice but it wasn't very cold... anywhere. They could have used a couple more swamp coolers and fans, but it is July in Arizona after all."}
{"text":"The food was very good the lemonade was delicious it's very big and open, it's a fun place to be with a group of friends or family they have many games you can play such as corn hole or ping pong also Foos ball they also have a section where you can buy clothes and shoes you can also work out in the boxing ring to"}
{"text":"Great spot near the Suns and Diamondback games.

Everyone is ordering labor intensive drinks, so the bar moves somewhat slowly, but that's sort of the Duce's thing... these drinks are real good and everything is made from scratch. The specialty drinks are worth the wait, but know that you have to wait the same amount of time to pay over $4 for an Old Style 12 oz can..."}
{"text":"Love love love this spot! Try the chicken pot pie in a jar! Delish. I've had two birthday parties here! At night they have a DJ and music. Mac-n-cheese bites are superb. I really dig the nostalgic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Awesome place especially when the weather is great. Higher prices in drinks but the corned bee sliders are pretty amazing. Like Leprechaun and a U I corn having a golden baby that becomes president amazing. The rest is good. Be sure to take out a small loan or bring a good cosigner I you're making a night o it because you'll need it. Maybe. Second mortgage. They have a $25 mojito with berries n stuff. They sell baby butt soft t-shirts for $33 dollars. I could have a Thai child build me a house for the price of a shirt here. Anyways they have ping pong so it's all worth it."}
{"text":"I was there this weekend for the first time and I love so many things about that place. 1. The space is lovely. 
2. DJ was amazing.
3. So many things to do. Played ping pong, foosball. Never got to the bean bags.
4. The teen with us loved her pot pie
Not so great things
1.  I was not impressed with the customer service when ordering dinner. I explained we were newbies and I didn't get the warm and fuzzy, let me tell you now things work here feeling. Very disappointing. 
2. We played ping pong near the big floor fan/boxing ring. Both my niece, 14 yrs old and I fell chasing the ball. That raised area tripled us both. My knee still has some swelling. Btw, I don't drink.
3. Dinner for 3 without drinks (we drank water) was $52 + tip. My niece thought her food was great. My daughter had the sliders she said was lukewarm. I had the ribs and I felt like they were drowned in sauce. Sauce was tasty but the ribs didn't taste grilled. More like they were baked or boiled. I was not impressed considering what I paid for them.  And it took about 45 mins to get it to use. Corn and potatoes were good.
I will be back as I really had a great time. Even after I fell, I suffered through the pain to finish my ping pong game."}
{"text":"Was going to goto last exit till I stumbled upon this place , pretty big place and had some girls inside so I gave it a shot,  music , karoke, clothing store, tennis , bean bags, boxing ring,  weird setup but cool at the same time , great elements for a place to chill , eat, and get drunk"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. I suppose maybe I needed a warning and didn't read the yelp reviews ;) the atmosphere if this place is amazing!!! Yard games to play, a boxing ring and punching bags. A dance floor with a love dj on a Saturday night. Lots of space which is perfect for anther crowd. So is the fact that they have picnic tables to fit in your larger group if you plan to eat together. The drinks weren't cheap but each was individually made. The juices all freshly squeezed and lots of fancy garnishes! The Moscow mile was very tasty and the Cranberry Cobbler was sweet but very good also. The food...another story. We weren't hungry upon arriving so we decided to have some drinks and hang out with friends. We checked out the place and decided we should order some food since a friend mentioned hers was going to take 20 minutes. By the time we got to the line to order the wait was one and a half hour. 1.5 hours?!?!?! WTF!!!!! I was completely shocked. Do they only cook one meal at a time? I know the kitchen is on the smaller side but I'd just never heard of such a thing. I work in the food industry so I brushed it off, enjoyed a couple more drinks while patiently watching the clock. Right around that 1.5 hour mark we notice food sitting in the window, although not wanting to be rude we didn't want to bother anyone to ask. About 10 minutes later was walk up there since we hadn't heard our name and were starving at this point. The man said the food had been sitting there for quite some time. Our sweet potato chips were completely cold and our sliders were not appetizing at all. He didn't offer anything for us or to maybe reheat the food we had waited the hour and a half for, just blamed us for not listening for our name well enough. What a disappointment!!! Can't say I'd eat there again, the cold food was terrible, even after having a couple drinks!"}
{"text":"You walk in and are surrounded by music, clanking of games being played, and laughter. The food was top-notch and the atmosphere was amazing. The set up to get your food and drinks was a little different but I felt that is what gave the place a unique vibe. We had the sliders and macaroni bites. They were absolutely delish."}
{"text":"So eclectic ... shopping, hula hoops, boxing, ping pong, bags - oh plus food and drink.  Super Fun for a summer active outing."}
{"text":"After the endless bro-bar scene in Scottsdale  this is a really nice change of pace. Friendly staff, great music, and so many activities. (Insert step brothers joke here) boxing, ping pong, shuffle board, karaoke, and many more.  plus, ever spill your drink on your date? Awkward right? Never fear, full clothing store in the bar. That's what I call solid foresight."}
{"text":"This is one of our faves for the fam! Ping pong, cornhole, BOXING! What? Why? How? Our preteens  love it as much as we do! Drinks are speakeasy style and the bartenders / mixologists are pretty much pros! My only, only, only thing that keeps me from a five star is that the prices are very steep."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Came with a group for a company event. Everything went off flawlessly- service, food, drinks: not one hiccup. When we got there we weren't sure where our tables were but it gave us time to walk around and check out the place while looking for our seats. Games  surround you and they even have special events in the boxing ring. Tonight people were playing bags and ping pong- nothing going on for boxing. We got our seats and off to the bar! The drinks here are phenominal. All craft cocktails made fresh. They have a specialty list of mojito's so that's what I got while my friend got a whiskey sour. Both garnished with fruit and both really yummy! (they also have quite the extensive beer menu)

As we chatted the food started coming in.. bites of mac and cheese muffins, Duce dip, 3 cheese dip, beer can chicken (roasted on a can of Old Milwaukee!) and little mini salads in tiny mason jars! The spread was incredible! Side note- you will not be on a diet here! Even the salads are dressing heavy but when here make it a cheat nite! 

While parking is challenging here we were lucky to be on a night where they had complimentary valet.  

Everyone needs to check out the Duce in its uniqueness and all the funness it provides!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing wish we had one back home love the atmosphere and people are really friendly. 
We will be coming back again,for sure."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place because it's now my ultimate favorite! I came in on Friday night on a double date and it was non stop fun! You get corn hole, fuse ball, ping pong and many other games. Plus a dj and a dance floor! What topped everything off for me was how good the drinks were! Plus the whole place is so so nice. The only downfall is that they have no ac. Yet even then you totally forget that it's hot because of how much fun you're having!"}
{"text":"I was here for a family birthday party recently. The grapefruit mimosa is great. I had some chicken was which was okay and the brisket was not so good."}
{"text":"I like this bar. 

Seriously. Karaoke. The theme. The boxing ring. The games. And the drinks are so cheap.

Honestly, this bar is perfect. If you read my reviews, you know I am not one for hanging out in bars that are overly crowded (Sorry. I like to have my personal space to myself). The Duce gets pretty busy, however, it has the floor space to handle it. It's a pretty large bar with a couple of different areas to hang out in. This is awesome because if you want to dance, you can. If you want to hang out with friends and chat, you can. If you want to go browse the random marketplace that is attached... you can...... random. But whatever. I do have to say that this bar will continue to be one that I will return to."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The location is perfect. Yes at first you are like, \"Is this the place?\" The atmosphere when you go in is like a smooth, chill, relaxed, breathe of fresh air. I need to go when there are more people like on a weekend. I went on a Wednesday and there were a few people there. I ordered the chicken pot pie, the brisket sliders, and I have to tell you it blew me away with how much I loved it.  The staff were awesome with me and they were very friendly. I will definitely be back to try out their swing dancing, if anyone wants to go, and their karaoke, if anyone wants to go."}
{"text":"Sadler and Frankie were exceptionally great service. Thank you!!! We will be looking forward to coming back and enjoying the drinks....soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to celebrate my 22nd birthday here a few weeks back with some good friends. I couldn't have picked a better place! We arrived around 9 and stayed till closing, alternating between dancing, drinking, and trying out the games. The drinks were delicious, and I loved drinking out out of mason jars. The ice cream shakes were also really good! The drinks are kind of expensive, (about $8-$10 per drink). However, I am totally alright with paying those prices thanks to the great staff, fun atmosphere, and excellent dancing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Funky place! We shared the slider sampler--7 different ones--favorites were the brisket and the egg slider which sounded boring, but was surprisingly flavorful and loaded with bacon. The s'mores cheesecake is incredible and could feed at least 4 hungry people which  were not after eating the sliders. We passed on the overpriced drinks. Great music in the background, interesting retro items for sale--a fun change and we will be back. But do go early and avoid the sun."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to dine. Had our last dinner there after a weekend in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. Had to get the Mac n Cheese muffins after watching Guy freak out over them on triple D. They were yummy but definitely need to be shared by three or more! Would love to stop by when the ring is open for sparring! Really good food and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just ok. We went on a mid day on Saturday for our first time,The concept is great - eat, play, drink. Parking is valet and not much room. Metered street parking available a little further away. A bit confusing when you walk in. From what we could tell there is no table service only self service. Food was mediocre. We ordered Chicago dogs but the bun was too heavy and plain and the dog itself was overloaded and messy. If we return again, we will try something else to see if food is always just so-so. Very fun vibe and whimsical decorations."}
{"text":"Gosh I want to I really want to give The Duce more stars but sadly that won't be happening ...
We came here tonight for a work holiday party.. and let me say this place is freaking weird it's like hipster spot or something i really can't tell.. but 19 salons all on one side of the place.. 
so this girls walking around with macaroni muffins topped with goat cheese. Omg they tasted so bland. The goat cheese over powered it take that off. So now the lines of \"buffet\" style food more like small appetizer bites of buffet style food.. not sure if this is how the are here with just small bites not a real meal?
Ok so let's start with the chicken in a beer can. Not bad it had a ton of flavor the skin omg the skin so tasty .. then a build ur own mashed potatoes now this was so good tons of flavor and so cute it was in a little mason jar. We got salads again in cute little mason jars only thing was the vinaigrette was nonexistent. Then again the ladies walked around with my little bites this time it was a cheese roll which was good if it didn't have a huge dollop of goat cheese..it didn't need the dang goat cheese it really took away from the roll... and a meatball roll which was more like a dry meatball with no flavor...but the best thing out of tonight was the little chicken pot pies again in a Manson jar lmao.. but that was the best best little bite of the night.
So not sure if we would come back here like just because but it was nice to get out of Glendale and have a fun Sunday night with the comp"}
{"text":"The Duce is a great place to have some fun! Whether you want to play corn hole, ping pong, have dinner, drinks, dessert, or just dance, they have it all! You can spend as much $ or as little as you'd like. I've been here a couple times. If you go late, leave your little ones at home. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't come here in the summer. It's very hot and they don't have AC running. Food is great and have tons of games. However, lack of staff. Takes forever to order drinks from the bartender, and it's awkward to just stand there and wait at the bar since there is no server at the table."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Good drinks, and great staff. Family friendly, and amazing Mac and cheese muffins. Will recommend this place more and continue to be a guest."}
{"text":"Different and fun, good amount of parking. Great date place with lots of fun folks"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party in which my classmates rented out the whole place.  This place has awesome decor and im happy with the location.  I wish Phoenix had more original bars like this.  The food was tasty, the cocktails outstanding, and the beer service was good."}
{"text":"WOW! I want a place like this in Chicago. What a cool space. What friendly staff. What incredible food! 

We stopped by here for a few light bites and a couple of drinks during our first day in Phoenix and were completely blown away by everything about The Duce. I only wish we had more time to hang out longer and sample more of the goodies they had to offer. 

Not to mention the fact that it was super cool to see a couple casually stroll in with their canine companion. My wife and I were missing our four-legged friends something fierce and we would've loved to enjoy their company in this chill atmosphere. 

Next time I'm in the area, this is a MUST visit. No complaints. 

Oh, and be sure to order the mac & cheese muffin bite things. They're so good, they should actually rename them \"AMAZEBALLS.\" (I hate myself for saying that). ((But it's true.))"}
{"text":"Can't really leave a fair review as they were out of like 75% of the food menu. Strike one
When food was ordered SOMEHOW part of the order was missed (even tho the cashier answered a specific question about the food that she forgot to order) Strike two
Couldn't access half of the place due to a private event. Strike three
The drinks were ok and the atmosphere was pretty laid back. Not enough to bring me back again tho...I'm sure there are plenty more patio bars around"}
{"text":"Should you ever find yourself in need of a vintage french military jacket, a deviled egg platter, a pair of PF Flyers and a quick spar in the boxing ring, all with a side of delicious meatball sliders and a gimlet, The Duce has you covered.  
Love it.  Love that it's close to work.  My new fave! :)"}
{"text":"The Duce will be everything you put into it. It's a Rorschach Test. If you're a lame, it's gonna be lame. If you know how to have fun, you won't find a better spot to let loose in. 

Quality here is key. The ingredients, the accents, the care in preparation. Ask their staff, their cooks, on what they make their food with. Down to the slightest detail they will provide you goods (and they are surprisingly health conscious when approaching even the \"comforty foods\" that would seem otherwise). 

THEY HAVE THE BEST CUBA LIBRE IN ARIZONA. Not even joking. Rum Bar in downtown couldn't even touch the Rum they have in the well. Organic, spiced, incredible. Best of all: Served in a Mason Jar, big daddy style. 

Try the chips. Prepared on the spot. Ask them how they're made, the health considerations they've made in the approach. 

The Sliders are must-have fare. 

The pies in a jar... UNREAL. Go here for dessert. Go here for the pie. In a jar. Take the jar home. Drink booze in said jar (winning formula right there). 

Okay, back to the booze. Old school spin on all of it. Their mint and other garnish: gorgeous. Nothing shoddy looking. Juices squeezed right in front of your eyes with some old school hardware: a press afixed to the bar itself. 

For the lo-fi: plenty of PBR, Schlitz and the like at a dirt cheap price. 

If you're man enough: make one of the workouts with Steve \"Coach\" on Wednesday, Friday and/or Sunday. Old school style, featured on now a couple of TV shows (I want to say the Travel Channel...?). Legit. The camaraderie there is incredible. The personal care is unmatched - I don't think I've met two owners who care more and POUR MORE of themselves into a place. These two (Steve and Andi) have the touch. 

Tell them GECKO sent you and you'll get love.

{"text":"ok. man. 

i'm on yelp pretty frequently, and although i usually just opt for posting photos of restaurants and their food instead of actually writing reviews, my experience of the duce just has to be told. 

so it's your average sunday. the weather outside was perfect and i wanted to get out and try something new for lunch and possibly get some day drinking in.  after looking over a few places downtown on yelp, the dude and i settled on the duce.  

WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, MISTAKE. 

now don't get me wrong, i knew that the duce was going to be in an old warehouse downtown that someone had turned into a restaurant.  in fact, that's what drew me in in the first place.  that and the menu sounded like they had some choice lunch items. meatball sliders? yeah man, let's do this.  that and in addition to the restaurant, they also sell clothing and other accessories. it was all sounding pretty good. 

when we first entered the warehouse, we were in the area that sold clothing and other knick-knacks.  because the place is pretty huge, we weren't exactly sure where the restaurant was, and were hoping one of the MANY employees who were standing around might steer us in the correct direction. but no, not a single word from anyone. ok fine, whatever. 

so we locate the restaurant portion of the warehouse, and see many long bench style tables, a bar, and an outside portion with more seating.  we spot the bartender and say hello as we're walking up, hoping that she'll inform us of how this all works (do we just sit wherever and have a waiter take our order? do we order at the bar? etc.). the bartender shoots back a quick hello and then immediately begins to chat it up with another waitress, completely ignoring that we're even there. ooook, i guess we're just supposed to figure this out ourselves!  we see that they've got their menu posted on the wall, so we begin looking at it, trying to figure out what we're going to order since we're assuming at this point that we just order at the bar.  after deciding on what we wanted, we stood around for literally another five minutes while the bartender and the waitress continued to chat and totally ignore us while we were just standing around clearly looking confused. oh, and did i mention we're THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE? 

eventually we became so annoyed with this that we decided to go outside and have a seat at one of the tables hoping that would get the attention of someone.  so we have a seat and anticipate that maybe one of the ten or so people outside who clearly worked there would maybe attempt to help us or even acknowledge our presence at some point, but again, no! literally no one said anything to us! 

after a few minutes of discussing how severely uncomfortable this was and whether or not we should just leave, the bartender comes rushing out and says, \"so did you guys want to order or what?\".  uh, ok! whatever! let's order now that you've decided we exist!  she then tells us that we're going to have to actually get up and come back inside to the bar to order, and that they'll call our name when the food is ready.  the hell? you can't take our order here since we're already seated and were too busy having some chit-chat time when we were standing inside trying to order before? screw. this. place.  and i haven't even tried the food yet.  oh, and you would also assume that since we ordered the food at the bar, we would pick it up at the bar as well, but again, no. you pick it up at the trailer that's parked outside where they're cooking it.  and yanno, this would have been fine had the bartender taken five seconds to actually mention this. 

so the food was surprisingly quite good (shocking!), but honestly, who even cares at this point.  i was so angry at how annoyingly awful this experience was that it just didn't matter to me how the food tasted, and i really just wanted to get the hell out of there.  upon leaving, no one said goodbye to us or even acknowledged that we were exiting, but i was pretty much expecting that.  and just in case you forgot,  can i say again how we were THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE?  

the concept of the duce may be a good one, but with such extremely rude employees that can't take five seconds to tell you how the restaurant works (oh hey! you order at the bar, we'll call you're name, you pick up the food at the trailer!) or even acknowledge that they have customers, i really can't understand how this place is going to survive.  i honestly do hate to be hard on a local restaurant, and wish i could say that maybe this could have been an isolated incident, but based on a lot of the other reviews, i can see that it's not. 

so in summary: i would never, ever, under any circumstance, go here again. this was truly the worst restaurant experience i've had in...uh, ever."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I would come back.  We went to The Duce around 7:45pm and parking was hard to come by.  Maybe I'm too cheap to do valet but we had to hoof it cause something was going on downtown because the side streets had alot of parked cars.  The environment was loud and fun.  It was kind of hard to find our way around.  First we wandered through the store and found ourselves standing in front of a boxing ring.  After throwing a few punches into the body bag we wandered to the bar.  We were trying to decided where to place our order.  

Food was different as far as taste and blends.  But it was okay.  I was really hoping that the food be dang good but it was just okay.  We ordered the half rack ribs and Chicago dog with potatoe crisp with bottled root beers.  Not impressed.  The root beer was awesome!  When the food was ready they called out our orders on a megaphone.  We couldn't hear it because of the DJ and karaoke.  Oh and the serviced sucked too.

Alot of social bugs showed up on a tour bus and the place started jumping.  It was fun and a great place to socialize and drink some expensive beer."}
{"text":"This spot is like no other place I've been. Bags, boxing ring, ping-pong, beer, dance floor, karaoke, bar, apparel shop, and the list goes on. They play truly good music and everyone really dances. I mean REALLY DANCES! None of this grinding all over one another crap. Real, having a good time, good vibes, moving bodies, dancing. Great spot if you are wanting a change of pace from the club or bar scene. I love coming here with a small group of friends and just enjoying one another's company."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I checked it out a year ago and I love it even more now that I've seen they've made improvements. I went dancing there quite some time ago and the air circulation was nonexistent so it was impossible not to get overheated but last night (April '14) I never thought twice about the temperature and I danced to their sweet swinging tunes all night long. Swing nights are probably my new favorite night of the week. The only reason that I didn't give them a 5 star review was that I was a little concerned about their bar tender. She was nice and made good drinks (freaking delicious actually) but she was very slow at making just two drinks and she used her hands to handle all of the ingredients. Like, tipped the jar of blueberries into her hand to put them in my drink. Don't bartenders typically use those spears to out that stuff in? It just seemed a little bit of excessive touching of something I'm going to be drinking."}
{"text":"We spend most family birthdays here. We come early to avoid the lines and to grab a table. While the adults enjoy \"crafty\" beers and hand-muddled cocktails, the kids blow off massive amounts if energy on old exercise equipment, shuffleboard, and ping-pong. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is great. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the fact that this isn't the plastic type bar and people you find in Scottsdale.  The Duce is in an unusual area of town but is worth the drive.   Great vibe, eclectic crowd of all ages, fantastic hand crafted cocktails, and fun dj/music.   The food truck inside is a nice change up; chicken pot pie is amazing, as was the cheesecake I heard.  The sliders were pretty mediocre though...tough bread.  There's a cute little shop, art to browse, and fun games to play as well.  Oh, it is almost all open air so when the weather is perfect it's awesome but I can't imagine its very comfortable throughout the summer months.  

It's a hard concept to explain but our group loved it and I would totally go back."}
{"text":"DJ WAS AWFUL!! I came with 15 young ladies last night for a bachelorette and he refused to play any music (karaoke night!) we wanted even though we were basically the only people there. He was insulting and rude and just beyond awful. The manager named Brian was very nice when I complained but also said there wasn't much he could do because the DJ had been at the location forever. I can't believe that such an establishment continues to pay for such poor service. Waitress was very nice and drinks were good if a bit over-priced but all of that is completely overshadowed by the rude DJ. I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"This is a super hipster hang out place. It seems pretty family friendly as we saw families here with kids dropping by for dinner and a chill night. The music does seem to get loud so I'm not sure if it's good for kids to stay long here. 

There is a variety of food trucks and drinks you can get here as well as a dance floor. My friend took us here on a Friday night and they only played '80s & '90s throw back songs so not sure what other songs they play here other nights. The outdoor area does seem to get hot in the summer so make sure to dress cool (even at night)!"}
{"text":"Just your typical historic building turned into a great restaurant, bar, boxing gym, vintage clothing shop, dance hall and boxing gymnasium---no big deal. The Duce is awesome, it's a Phoenix gem and something we should all be proud of. The owners of the Duce took a  chance on the Warehouse district long before most people and are on the vanguard of bringing downtown Phoenix back and making it awesome. The food is delicious, the drinks are cold and yummy, the staff is great. I love the Duce."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! The macaroni and cheese muffins are a must have. The chicken pot pie in a jar is the best I've ever had by far. Such a unique vintage place that plays great oldies and has such a positive and fun vibe."}
{"text":"This place had the coolest atmosphere!  The outside is very deceiving- looks like an abandoned warehouse but you step inside (patio area too) & I was just amazed!  Food was great & service was spectacular!  We went for an early lunch but started filling up as we left.  Can't even imagine the fun at night!"}
{"text":"Come here on a saturday night and the place was totally dead. 
Ordered Ribs and a Salad and my friend had the sliders. All three were terrible food. 

The $21 vodka mixer was good but not $21 worth. the $6 Sluggs were great value. 

All in all just not a happening place!!"}
{"text":"We saw this place during the zombie walk on Saturday 29th and we came back for drink after.
This place is cutely retro. We didn't eat at this place since we already eat before we came, but the drinks were excellent!  I had basil cocktail, it was deliciously fresh! I wish they have more wine list since I'm not beer drinker. 
Love the retro decor, it was just perfect!"}
{"text":"Holy hipster Batman!

How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. The service is absolutely terrible. And if there's one thing you should focus on above all, it's the service. It gets 2 stars simply for being unique and interesting. It's a very large place and has a ton of knick knacks everywhere. They also fresh-squeeze all of their juices, which is pretty awesome to watch. The drinks are all unique, but slightly overpriced in my eyes. But the bartenders - oh the bartenders. Seriously, pick the pace up. I waited for 25 minutes just to even order my drink. Most bartenders will ask you want you want to drink WHILE making the previous customer's drink to help move things along more quickly. Not these guys. Nope. They have all the time in the world apparently. And it gets to the point to where you just simply want to leave because you're growing tired of just standing at the bar, waiting to order a damned drink. I'm a fairly patient person and I understand things get busy and you have to wait your turn, but this was just annoying and frustrating. My friend did order the sliders and they were rather tasty, although incredibly greasy. Nevertheless, I have no desire to spend a ton of time standing at the bar waiting for a frou frou drink that's costing me $11 when I could just go elsewhere and get a vodka cran for $4 in 5 minutes or less. Pick up the pace and I'd love to come back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with someone special. Dj played that funk music (according) to my bf. Food is excellent. Try their slider sampler and mac n cheese muffin. We we're satisfy with all the food. You can also play games, dance (YMCA lol) but it is def hot hot hot outside in the summer time"}
{"text":"This place is very strange. Weird seating arrangement. They also have a boxing ring inside. I've never been a big fan of going to a place that runs out of something in they're menu? How do you run out of sausage?"}
{"text":"This place... omg is the cutest. I love the rustic vibe throughout the restaurant. Service was great, food is really good! I love how they ask for a unique name for your order to be called out for. We will definitely be coming back even if it's just for deserts"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!
Yummy cocktails and food! (macaroni & cheese muffins). I'm not a fan of the parking and it can get super crowded at night - but I can deal with that with all the fun games, food and drink, and people watching."}
{"text":"The PotPie was off the hook and the space was relaxing I could find myself back. Drink prices a little high though $23.00 seemed.... Well"}
{"text":"This review could be really long because this place has so much going on. I will make it short and to the point. 

1) Food was delicious. My only complaint was that is was luke warm when served. 
-Mac and cheese balls, brisket sand, breakfast sand-all really good. The kugel was almost as good as mine, and I am critical. Dad had chicken pot pie and liked it a lot. Some items served in mason jars-really cute touch. 

Service was really slow. Staff was friendly. 

2) There is so much going on. Music playing, table tennis, boxing area. It was a lot to take in, but would be a ton of fun to go again now that I know what to expect. 

3) It does get loud, but my 75 year old dad enjoyed himself."}
{"text":"This place is trying, but failing. The whole concept is cool, but they are just not pulling it off. Very unorganized, and mismanaged. My husband and a friend went in for drinks and food, and after settling in to our table were informed that our table was reserved and we were going to have to move. Even though there were no signs on the table stating the tables reserved, they forgot to put them up. As my husband joked- that's nothing that a beer can't fix- the girl rudely told us that would not be possible, and we were going to have to move before the party showed up the table is reserved for. Horrible customer service. Untrained staff. And then later one of my clients informed me that she had gone to this venue with her friends and one of the free weights had rolled off the shelf and fallen on her hand, her finger broke through her skin-there was blood all over- she passed out. and the manager on duty just offered her a cup of ice. No other assistance was offered. This client has since had several surgeries and now her finger has been amputated. As far as I know the Duce  has not contacted her to at least apologize or try to offer any assistance with all of the medical bills that she has incurred."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food was tasty!!  And the atmosphere is so cool!  If you haven't been before, you really need to check it out.  Unlike anything in the area!"}
{"text":"It's a bit out of the way and in a dicey neighborhood. Once inside it is like a big playground. Liked the feel. They have ping pong, shuffle board, bean bag toss, a boxing ring, shopping for too expensive fatigues, etc...... That was fun. However for me the Happy Hour food was just okay and so was the orange blossom beer. Have had better. Not a good value. HH only goes till 6 so it is difficult to make it there after work. Liked the music. A good mix of the new and old."}
{"text":"AMAZING and Unique!!!!!! Last Thursday was my first time at the Duce and I can't wait to go back.  Valet parking was very convenient.  

You can order drinks from any of the bars.  All drinks are organic with fresh squeezed juices.  I started with the Duce lemonade which was not my  favorite.  I was not fond of the taste so I decided to go with a bloody mary for the second round.  The bloody mary was very tasty just a little to spicy for my liking so I ordered  Mule next.  The Mule was just what I was looking for in fact I had 2 more.  

One of the downfalls is servers do not take food orders.  When you are ready to order you have to go place your order at  the trailer.  For me, I like the convenience of having a server come to my table, take my order, bring the food and drinks.  As for the food it is mind blowing delicious.  The strawberry brushetta is do die for and is a must as well as the mac and cheese muffins.  

Thursday is Karaoke night and DJ seems to wide range of music from 80's and 90's. Make sure you know what you want to sing because there is no book to choose from.  I was a little turned off when the DJ made an announcement that everyone needed to get the F*@& out of the place.  Just not the greatest choice in words.

Overall it was great experience and I WILL be going back."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites!  I live in California and every time I'm in Phoenix The Duce is a must. The only thing is the prices are pretty high.  Other than that this is a great place...cool atmosphere and fantasticly yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"Pros: Unique hipster hangout. Good food  (only had 200 calories left for the day, so I had the egg scramble). Fun drinks (spiked root beer float). Cute decor. Easy system to order and pick up food. 

Cons: They sell super cute clothing items; unfortunately I find it difficult to pay $80 for a t-shirt. Complimentary valet; no private parking. I feel compelled to tip a person to perform a service I normally perform myself. Hate that."}
{"text":"Wildly inconsistent experiences, but it definitely delivers in the uniqueness category.  The bartenders and staff are really great, though the drinks take forever mainly because they go a little over board with the fruit muddling and the like.  Jamie makes me Old Fashion's the way I like them, so I keep coming back, no matter how long it takes to make that drink.  

Overall, this place has nearly limitless potential, they just need to stop being so stubborn and stop being different for different's sake (with regards to the bar)"}
{"text":"Very chill place to go with a group of friends that aren't into getting super drunk or all dressed up for the club. Fun games for everyone and great DJ on Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on triple D and had to try it. The atmosphere is different, very open patio sorta layout mixing country comfort with modern and industrial, I dig it. Being an open layout makes it a bit uncomfortable during the summer. As a newbie it was a bit confusing where to start and what not. The staff is nice and full of energy. First, I ordered a Strawberry Limeade. It was absolutely delicious and very refreshing however a bit pricey, the price would not stop me from ordering again because it was so yummy. Second, I ordered Mac n Cheese Biscuits and Pot Pie in a Jar. The mac n cheese biscuits were good but something seemed missing though, maybe a sprinkle of salt or some other spicy would fill in that void. Also the price was reasonable for the Mac n cheese biscuits. The pot pie was very good. A bit small for the price but no complaints on taste or anything like that. Over all everything was good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"An annex full of open seating, ping pong tables, corn hole, and a foosball table. Good cocktails, creative bar food, decent looking boozy desserts and a small clothing shop. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Cool, unconventional place. The brisket sliders are a must. The meat is so tender and just yummy. The bun was also so good. Tasted like a fresh bakery roll. The cheese sliders also had great flavor. The macaroni and cheese balls/muffins were tasty, too. 

The cocktails - oh my. I tried the Southside and the Cherry Sidecar. Both were amazing. I love that all the cocktails are vintage inspired."}
{"text":"Interesting place, Went here for a party. Had a lot of fun. The place is a center of activity. You can play corn hole, ping pong, box your friends, or shop at the surplus store. Lots of space, long tables mostly, as far as seating goes. To stay with their retro style, you are limited to retro beers such as Schlitz, Miller, and Hamms. Not really my thing. They have a couple drafts as well. We had fun knocking around the punching bags, tossing the medicine ball. The place turns into a cowboy bar later in the day, lots of hats and boots, if you are into that,. Its trendy, really crowded on weekends and a must-do at least once...It will only be once for me, unless there's another party...then I will get my Schlitz on!"}
{"text":"Awesome place so cool and fun could use a few more ping pong tables some shuffle board and foos ball though but such a good atmosphere we all really loved it and really cool dj ."}
{"text":"This place is the type of place that you want to go with a big group of friends. There is a lot of cool things to check out like the corn hole area, the shuffleboard game, and pingpong tables Not to forget the abundance of hula hoops that are just hanging around. It's very cute inside with the food truck being the main source for delicious food like fried mac n cheese bites. They make all their cocktails concoctions with real ingredients. You want a grapefruit margarita? Well prepare yourself for the freshest one you'll ever taste! 

One downside is that it gets pricey FAST. I ordered two cocktails and one appetizers and wound up spending over $40 (with tip) on MYSELF. I love good food and booze but I can't afford to come here every weekend. This is a place I'll save for the special occasions. :) Or at least until I win the lottery then I'll go EVERY WEEKEND. 

There is something different going on every day so check their online calendar to see what's going on that night. Overall, a very lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great spot! High energy incredible food: chicken pot pie and beer can chicken were the choice tonight. Both were amazing! Nate the bartender was amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved it!
Very fun place to hang out with a group of friends. Prices are a little high but the food and drinks are great. 
Took them a while to make an appetizer that i ordered  but it was delicious in the end."}
{"text":"Fun place. Drinks are pretty freakn pricey. Stick to the beer and your wallet will be okay. They have things to do here though which is awesome! drinking beer, playing a number of games like cornhole, shuffle board, ping pong. who can ask for more?

great place to hang out with some friends for sure."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service. I really enjoyed  the ambiance but I don't know when I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the ultimate COOL place!  Wifey and I walked into this joint and, after looking at each other, both of us said \"wow, cool!\"  The first thing you see is the ping pong tables!  Then you see the boxing ring...yes, boxing ring!  And it is a restaurant/bar...kind of...it is also a gym, kind of...but...overall...just cool.

We were on our last few hours in Phoenix...and this was a great choice of place to hang out until our flight...

Ok...so...we were there to eat...

First, you go outside to the trailer and counter order your food.  We decided to go for three appetizers...the Mac and Cheese Balls, Pickle Slaw in a Jar and Chicken Pot Pie Jar.  So, how were they?  Very good!

High expectations for the Mac and Cheese Balls...I was not a fan, but wifey thought they were very good.  So, I guess that rounds out to be a balance!  Probably just personal preference!

The Pickle Slaw was interestingly good!  Fresh cabbage, cinnamon pickles, golden raisins and pineapple.  Kind of a crazy mix of things...but...really good...after that first bite of introduction!

The Pot Pie?  OUTSTANDING!  Wifey and I both really liked this one!  We almost licked the jar clean...just get it!

We also just relaxed for over an hour and half, it was that comfortable!

While in Phoenix, we ate at several great restaurants...this was, obviously, one of these...and...we both ranked them...out of the 8 restaurants we ate at, this one ranked...

Wifey - #1 for atmosphere and #1 for food
Me - #1 for atmosphere and #4 (but the top 4 are separated by very, very, very little!)"}
{"text":"A really interesting and trendy bar, with actual local color and one of a kind flair. Tasty drinks and special atmosphere that is family friendly and fun."}
{"text":"This is a nice kick back bar near my work that's a nice place to hang with the guys and throw back a few cold ones. They don't necessarily have the best drink specials but they do have craft beer and good food to enjoy. I enjoy playing some bags in the air conditioning and the mood is right. Service was good no real complaints besides getting a warm beer from the outside bar. I would recommend this place if your not dressed up and just want something casual. It's overall a decent bar. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wow! What a space! Sadly I can't see going here all that much due to the location. 

And I'm guessing that the prices on clothing are about the cost of the local residence's weekly wage. 

I'm hoping for the best but fearing the worst."}
{"text":"I don't like giving Bad reviews, so I will try to be as accurate as possible. After hearing many good things about this restaurant, Thursday afternoon I decided to stop by and finally give it a try. After spending $22 on a side of corn, a hotdog, and a margarita I was already somewhat unsatisfied with the price. However I did see organic listed on many menu items. After my food arrived it looked very appealing, garnished well. I tried the margarita, it was good but I questioned if the drinks were measured or free poured as I couldn't taste any alcohol. Moving back on, the corn was simple corn off the cob with butter, at this point all mediocre. The bad review started when I bit into the hot dog to discover the casing on the dog was soggy, chewy and not crisp. This hot dog was like rubber, I had to rip it apart. I'm used to a good hot dog having a \"snap\" when you bite in. Also the hotdog was so drown in relish it's all you could taste, and the rock hard bun couldn't hold in the toppings.  So after gnawing through this under/over cooked hot dog (I'm not sure which it was) I quickly wrapped up and left. Safe to say I will not be returning solely on the price of this below average food. I've honestly had better food at a dive. This place should shut down their kitchen and just be a bar with the ambiance factor. 
That's really the only reason there's 2 stars, it's got a nice hip feel to it. There's too many good restaurants in the area to waste time or money here. Additionally I would like to note there is zero service here. Unless you walk up to the workers you will be entire left alone, some people might like that, I thought it was poor service for how slow it was on this afternoon. A simple follow up with \"how was your food\" would have avoided this review but like I said, zero service. Avoid this place if you've heard good, evaluate who told you it was good and ask, why? Clearly not because of their food. How do you mess up hotdogs? I could have boiled a better hot dog at home.  The only thing they seem to be doing right is creating a good initial environment, so good job to whoever put this place together."}
{"text":"They really could do a much better job. Great location and great venue but just a lack of execution. Over priced drinks and awful food. 

The bathrooms are dreadful both male and female. 

Also...what the hell are kids doing in this place after 7pm. 

The wait staff was constantly carrying dirty/clean dishes right through the flow of the building. Not there fault at all in fact the servers and bar tenders are the only reason it's not a one star. 

Do better"}
{"text":"Good cold  beer real nice people who are friendly and polite and good at what they do.
I had a couple 24 oz beers 10 bucks apiece whoooaaa
Did I mention it was cold,,,, that's a good thing
I ordered the shepherds pie parfait which is a shepherds pie in a parfait glass.
The problem is that it's not a pie and it's not a parfait and it is 10 bucks
It was a side dish at best
It's served in an ice cream fountain glass layered mashed potatoes hamburger and peas shredded cheese on top
I guess I expected to be fed a meal of some sort for ten bucks
One of the people I was seated with had the family pack of sliders which looked enough for 1 maybe 2 people
It is an interesting place but not worth the money, I had to go home and get something to eat"}
{"text":"This place was way cooler than I expected. 

First of all it's HUGE. They host events (an art gallery when I was there). 

They have a prohibition theme, so they have all these drinks from \"prohibition era\" that are pretty rare to be made today. 

Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Again mixed feelings - came here as a customer and loved the entire concept but noticed they needed a lot of help behind the bar.

Asked for a job bartending and they offered it to me on the spot.  Came in to train for bartending and they had me train as one of the trailer cashiers instead.  Wasn't really happy about this - plus I disagreed with a lot of their customer service practices, and decided to leave after a couple of weeks.

As a week or more went on and I got to know the owners I also found out that they used to be primarily clothing designers and had sold their Fatigues brand to Chicos and had then invested their time and money into the Duce.

Again I love their entire concept and really think it could be an amazing place one day.  My only two suggestions would be to bring in bar and restaurant manager with lots of experience with a FOOD not RETAIL background."}
{"text":"came here with family on a Thursday night and was pretty busy but not overly packed but only one guy running the valet so the cars are backed into the street and he is running with his head cutoff, he did a great job considering. 
I ordered the mac n cheese muffins and chicken pot pie in a jar. I would have bet $100 that I would like the mac n cheese muffins over the pot pie but I loved the chicken pot pie and didn't really care for the mac n cheese muffins. my cousin liked them though. the kids loved playing ping pong etc..."}
{"text":"The Duce is really unique. It's like a big warehouse full of most of the stuff I could ever want. The store has some pretty cute stuff, but it can be pretty overpriced for just adding one embellishment to a plain white pair of  long underwear. I have sucked it up in the past and purchased an old French ammunition bag that had a couple embellishments added onto it and to this day it's one of my favorites and gets tons of comments when I bring it along with me.

They have stuff for men, women, and shoes and housewares as well. Lots of nice vintage sports wear for men, purses and clothes for women, perfumes and body lotions and the like, vintage glasses, bowls and cookware as well as cookbooks. 

But.. it's not just a store. There's also a soda and coffee shop which are vintage and adorable. Every time I've been there though, they've never been open :(

Also, there's a boxing ring. Yes. A real one.

When you made it past the wares you'll find a huge gorgeous antique bar with all the typical drinks as well as the vintage. You can get an Old Fashioned here. A real one. I introduced a friend to Old Fashions for the first time here. He couldn't take them. Ha.

Outside and inside has seating to drink or eat or chit chat and the patio out back has a food truck for the cookin'. You can get sliders, appetizers, breakfast... and nothing I've had is bad.

Beware on hot days though, there's no air or wasn't last year and we roasted in July."}
{"text":"Steve and Andi Rosenstein have taken on a large space and given it more personality than Meryl Streep on steroids.  You have to see it to really understand it, but this review will attempt to offer a written tour.

The first thing Steve and Andi did was to plant a lemon tree and an orange tree right in the middle of the building, in homage to the neighborhood's once being the produce district of Phoenix.

Then there's the vast retail area.  The couple own R & R Surplus clothing and sell it at The Duce.  It's comfortable vintage with a little special bling added.

The kitchen is housed in an old silver Airstream trailer, on a large patio filled with long wooden picnic tables.  Even the extra beer is iced in vintage coolers on the patio.  And The Duce provides the same beer brands that are served at Wrigley Field. 

The menu is small but select.  Brunch and sliders are served all day.  And \"supper\" is served from five until closing.  Brisket beef sliders are one of the house specialties.  Besides the regular menu, each night the grillmaster decides what he feels like cooking.  They were offering hot dogs (my personal favorite) the night I was there so I took advantage of that.  The fixings included the freshest, greenest, most delicious relish I have ever tasted, and the coleslaw is made with cinnamon pickled dressing.

The whole experience combines to make guests feel as though they are at a neighborhood barbecue, albeit one where your neighbor presents a check at the end of the night.  But that's okay.  All fun comes with a price.  And The Duce is nothing if not fun

{"text":"The place overall is cute and has some fun things to see and maybe do along with a great variety of music.The drinks and freshness of the fruit they use to make the drinks are awesome... And that's it! The staff rating I choose to give is about three stars (fair rating). The bartenders are meh, with no attempt to really be friendly or try and make some type of good relationship with their customers. I get you might be overwhelmed and busy with bartending and making drinks, but these people are the ones choosing your gratuity- be friendly or atleast make an effort! Really no main issue with the staff since they just come off as impersonal and not really approachable or approaching to their customers- so it's a blah there. The atmosphere is awful. Unless of course you enjoy surrounding yourself around snobby individuals. When you go out for an evening (anywhere) to a place with good music and awesome drinks, it's normal to maybe have a conversation starter with the bartender, person next to you at the bar waiting for a drink, or out by the dance floor. Not here. People look at you as if you're an alien from another planet or as if lobsters are Coming out of your ears. And the funny part is that youre no where near Scottsdale. Lol!
Oh yeah, and if you want some special kind of pajama pants, go there, they're at a whopping great deal for $106.00!!!"}
{"text":"The Duce is truly an adult playground. As I walked into the warehouse-turned-bar, I was surrounded by folks playing pin pong, foosball, and baggos. A boxing ring caught my eye, though it was not in use at the time. 

I immediately felt at home as I was welcomed by employees in CHICAGO CUBS GEAR!!!! Go cubbies! They played the Cubs anthem and had a wide range of Chicago classic beers, including 312s & Hamm's. 

I decided to venture to the outdoor seating area, where I immediately saw a vintage metal food truck and a lit up bar filled with people. 

I ordered the brisket sliders, the Mac and cheese muffins, and a shandy. Everything was delicious but I especially loved the muffins. Lightly dusted with Parmesan cheese, the dough to cheese ratio was perfection. Enjoyed every bite of these babies. 

The best thing about this bar? The atmosphere. I couldn't help but dance along to Stevie Wonder and the classic rock songs that were booming from the speakers. Everyone there looked so happy and my mood was immediately brought up thanks to this place. 

The only negative- It took a LONG time to even order my food. It wasn't excessively crowded enough to excuse the wait. I waited for over 20 minutes to order, then another 15 for my food. They only had one lady taking orders, getting everyone drinks, and giving the orders to the cooks.

Overall I'd for sure come here again. Loved the atmosphere and the perks this place offered!"}
{"text":"I just went there for a visit, and it was half an hour till last call (which is midnight there on a business day), so my review can't really comment on the food or the drinks. BUT the atmosphere was really cool. To get to the bar, you have to walk through the whole shop and \"gym\". It's certainly interesting, different than any bar I know. It's kind of an open area, so cold at night - but they've got heaters (yes, inside). Considering the sketchy neighborhood, I would never imagine something so cool there. Tons of vintage drinks served in big drink glasses and an awesome food menu. I'm excited to come here when it's open for a bit longer to indulge! I would recommend longer hours though, especially around the holidays. It's definitely someplace different to go to, and in Downtown Phoenix, there's not many of these places. Take a break from Lost Leaf and check this place out."}
{"text":"It's hipster haven! Located in a refurbished warehouse with a modified vintage Airstream camper serving as the kitchen, this place has something fun for almost everyone: hula hoops for use, a boxing ring, bean bag tosses, a foosball table, a great craft bar with a list of killer cocktails, and some old beers available (think Hamm's, Coors, PBR, Miller High Life) as well as some craft brewery suds too. Daily changes in music and entertainment also add to he vibe. If you can't find something to occupy your interest here you should probably should check yourself for a pulse. The vittles offered are eclectic and all over the map so unless you are a complete hater of food, you can likely find something you can eat. Portions aren't huge but prices are not stratospheric either. The one thing that I can recommend is the Beer Can Chicken which promises an entire local bird with a can of Old Milwaukee shoved up its nether regions. It is basted on the outside with some type of sweet siracha BBQ sauce. I recommend drinking the remnants in the beer can once you've gnawed off all the bones. It mortified the server but then she told me later she thought about it and it sounded pretty good. She was right as it was like adult chicken soup! Go during nice weather and sit under the open roof for a fun different place to spend some time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food! Love the drinks there. DJ is a nice touch if you're looking to just eat, drink, and groove."}
{"text":"Went there many times and the latest was after a busy Cardinal's game at Wrigley. We went about 3 hrs after the game ended and I cut my foot on a rusted piece of metal that is bent outward. We asked the waiter for the attention of management to put a cone or something up that would prevent others from suffering a cut by rusty metal like ninjas and after one hour we got their attention. They asked if I needed an ambulance which they admitted they have to by law and then put a cone up. I refused that option as I can walk but will need to see if I need a tetanus shot."}
{"text":"First off, this place was NOT air conditioned. The only thing they have are large fans. So the whole place is hot and humid. Secondly, all of their chairs and tables look like they were from a junk yard. I figured they were trying to go for a outdoor, maybe country, vintage look but it looked like the tables were falling apart. Also, since it was hard, all the tables and chairs were sticky. Thirdly, food was not great. I got a chicken pot pie in a mason jar and it was not worth the $7 I spent. Not only was it almost watery, but it was teeny! If anything, it was worth $2 or $3. I also tried there sliders and nothing special. If you want overly priced, mediocre sliders, then this is the place to go. Last but not least, were the employees. The only reason this rating was 2 starts instead of 1 were the employees. Very nice people."}
{"text":"This place is hipster haven. I kinda love it.

The decor is perfect for instagram photos. The tiny shops are like a pinterest board filled with etsy items. There are hula hoops, bag games, old person shuffleboard, a boxing ring, adorable picnic tables... I mean, wtf is this even.

Drinks take a while to be made, because the bartenders actually put effort into each cocktail you request. Muddling galore here. It's lovely. I got a giant mason jar of a raspberry mule and it was in-fucking-credible. Highest of recommendations. Be warned, you'll be spending a good amount of your hard earned blogger cash because this place ain't cheap. twenty something bucks for my drink, but it was damn tasty. Also, I was already halfway to drunk, so I couldn't be bothered to care.

Grab your fixie, don your favorite fedora, and good luck pretending not to be impressed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place the atmosphere and the food was delish the macaroni bites are so darn delish!!!!! My husband had his company party there and it was so much fun. There are games you can play corn hole , Foosball, ping pong. I will be back with friends music was great too and don't forget the drinks with their fresh selection of fruits..."}
{"text":"I came to the Duce for a work happy hour and loved this place. The corky decorations, gift shop, bleachers, cornhole and drinks in a mason jar. 

Really awesome hang out - in a strange location behind the ball park. I'll return"}
{"text":"I'd like to give a review of the food and the establishment itself, but I never really got the chance to experience it. It looked like a ton of fun with some unique fare, but we only managed to spend about 15 minutes inside before giving up.

My Dad has mentioned seeing The Duce on Food Network a couple times, so I decided to take him there after my family attended an event at the nearby Talking Stick Resort Arena. When we arrived there was some sort of a private party taking up nearly half of the place. That's fine. But it took sometime to try to secure a table inside since the temperature was a little more cool than usual that day. Then when I went to grab some menus, I heard the cashier tell the people ordering at the time that it was going to be an hour for food. No. We didn't have that kind of time. We're going somewhere else.

I don't want to tell anyone how to run their business. But if you are going to host a private party and remain open to the public, you may want to make sure your kitchen can handle the load. I would have been much happier and more understanding if we had just been turned away at the door."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go here ever since I saw Guy Fieri's take on the place on Triple D. He correctly touted it as retro, kitschy and funky. What he failed to mention was that it is also uncomfortable (ridiculous table and bench setups, tables and chairs with torn upholstery from the 50s, no air conditioning or heating, etc.), tight fisted on servings and....well, dirty. The dining area is open to the elements, even when you choose to eat \"inside\" so whatever flies, drifts or blows in....does. The tray our food was served on had a glob of grease underneath right where my fingers came to rest as I carried it. Our table had probably seen soap and water maybe several days earlier. In the middle of the warehouse (yep, that's what it is) is a boxing ring which we knew about, and a clothing emporium which we didn't know about. Too much going on to feel comfortable. This warehouse didn't know what it wanted to be when it grew up.

Now about the food. The brisket sliders were awesome! The mac & cheese muffins were fun, tasty and we had enough left to take home. That's where the good part ended.  The sweet potato chips were almost microscopic and we could not figure out where they got such tiny sweet potatoes. Most were sized between the size of a dime and a quarter. Several chips were burned beyond recognition. The iced tea was served in a small mason jar and there were no free refills. If you prefer a non-nutritive sweetener, make sure you bring your own. They only have raw sugar and agave. And everything is ala carte. If you have a huge appetite, bring a sizable wallet with you.

For the hype from Triple D, this was not worth the trip for us. We have no desire to go through the discomfort of sitting in that place again.  If I get a strong jones for those brisket sliders I will definitely call ahead for take-out."}
{"text":"This is a super cute restaurant/bar/sweet stop/playground for adults! And the perfect way to end my vacation from Havasupai falls!

I came here in a group of 6 on a weekday a little bit before 4pm for an early dinner. There was barely anyone here (as most people were probably at work) and it was really easy to find a table for us. The outdoor bar/station was where we ordered food and beer, the bar inside served more drinks, and there was a soda fountain for ordering dessert! We made it just in time for happy hour ($2 off the sampler slider and select beer) so I got the sampler sliders with a mango beer by Papago brewing. My group shared their artichoke dip & five cheese dip as well as their sampler mac& cheese muffins that were rated to be a must-try at this place. The sampler sliders consisted of 3 sliders; one meatball, one chicken sausage, and one brisket. Brisket was definitely my favorite. One of my friends got the breakfast sliders which were literally an egg and sausage patty, and she wasn't much of a fan of the bread they used.

While you're waiting for food, they have a bunch of games to play such as cornhole, giant connect four, pingpong, or a boxing ring if you're trying to throw some punches. This place doubles as a workout gym too! And they have a lot of picturesque spots here that will probably look good on your IG such as a herb wall and a little garden in their outdoor patio. Check out their merchandise section too, as they have some funky stuff to sell."}
{"text":"What's your name? Whatever you want it to be baby.

Asking you to pick an alias for your order and awaiting it over the intercom is just one of the fun details to be found at the Duce. Mac and cheese muffins and alcohol infused milkshakes are the icing on a delicious cake. The strawberry shortcake kind, with vodka, muddled strawberries and whipped cream. Oh yes. 

This place is a smorgasbord of so many things. A boxing ring with your brunch, a backyard BBQ of ping pong and corn hole, a serene Sunday of yoga?  It never ends. It's a warehouse-o-joy with no room for the snoody foodie kinds. OK, there's so much room. But it's reserved for those that like to dance and smile and hula hoop. The food wasn't my favorite ever, but it was an eclectic experience. And I enjoyed it. Hard to sit and savor when surrounded by this sweet sensory overload anyhow. 

Go. Eat. Don't Eat? Drink. Sing? Doesn't Matter. Just have fun. So-much-fun."}
{"text":"Always love coming to The Duce.  Not only is the environment great, the food is yummy and the drinks are awesome! There's always something to do, even if it's just people watch.  They have ping pong tables, a dance floor, a couple bars, and even a boxing rink.  

The employees are very nice and helpful whether it be your first time or 17th.  It's in a quieter part of downtown but still close to all the busyness.  Perfect spot to include on your next bar hopping adventure.  May I recommend renting an Ofo bicycle for only a buck an hour and cruising down here?  Doooooo it!

It's a little quiet on the weekends sometimes, but every now and then it gets quite crazy with everyone piling in to have a good time :)"}
{"text":"This is such a great hang out spot and their drinks are freshly made with real fruit probably one of the best drinks I've had is here. Super friendly environment and you'll definitely have a great time"}
{"text":"Great place with lots of interesting aspects. Fun with friends and plenty to do there. The food is wonderful, especially the chicken pot pie in a mini jar! The drinks are ok. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a blast at The Duce! We had the strawberry kiwi mango bruschetta and the pot pie in a jar. Both were absolutely delicious. The pot pie in a jar tasted so warm and comforting with a creamy, rich base. Very herby as well. The bruschetta was refreshingly sweet and desert like with a tang from the goat cheese and balsamic reduction. Nice crunchy baguette bread too. We also enjoyed the bars throughout The Duce. Nice to be able to move around and go to less busy bars. The cocktail were fresh and fun. I loved watching the bartenders create my drink before my very eyes. Fresh fruit and interesting flavors. Fun games and fabulous DJ. Big dance floor and boxing ring. Lovely, sweet and nostalgic atmosphere. Not to mention the to die for merchandise. Superb candles. I will be back to The Duce!"}
{"text":"01/20/11

A group of girlfriends and I met here for happy hour and really enjoyed ourselves!  I arrived first and so was able to secure a parking spot right at the entrance of the venue.  The shopping area of this establishment was an eclectic mix of \"vintage\" and contemporary items ranging from leather jackets that sell by the pound and tree-hugger organic tees to hand-painted glasses and nostalgic candies in old-fashioned wrappers.  There's even a boxing rink for those who suddenly feel the itch to go a few rounds!  (Back to those vintage jackets- I took this to mean that every jacket was weighed and charged a fixed price per pound, but this wasn't so... Each jacket I tried on had a different dollar amount per pound assigned.  A gimmick that initially piqued my curiosity suddenly made me want to leave the shopping area and just head over to the restaurant and check out the drink and food offerings.)  The indoor dining area was set up for community-style dining, w/ long rectangular tables and high benches.  Outdoors, there were picnic tables and chairs on one side and a silver streamliner at the other where all food orders are placed, w/ people lining up to order, pay, and then retrieve their orders when called.  Another gimmick that I probably wouldn't mind if I were dining outside, but didn't care for since I was dining indoors w/ friends, a couple who'd ordered food and a couple who didn't, away from cigarette smoke and the cold air...

Two of the three girlfriends had arrived before the 6p HH cut-off, but one, Linda, had to take a call, and she was therefore left out of the \"duce off\" each drink deal.  This was the first time I ever had a grasshopper (cremes de menthe and cacao and cream over ice), and I enjoyed it very much!  So much, I bought my own supplies  to make my own version a few days later!  The friend who was not given the discount had originally wanted a light beer (@ 5:50p), but was told none were offered here.  We all liked our selections and agreed that we'd very much like to meet again for HH.

One of us is allergic to gluten (no, not me!) AND a vegetarian, so after she had asked HER set of questions, she ordered the omelet skillet, first w/ ingredients that the kitchen was out of (asparagus?), so she settled w/ mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese.  She enjoyed the dish, and stated that the veggies were very fresh!  I had the Brisket sliders and an order of house-made potato crisps, which I was told were coated w/ EVOO and baked, not fried (the streamliner kitchen was not equipped w/ a fryer).  I found the chips to be too greasy and overcooked (see photos), but my gluten-free vegetarian friend found them addictive!  I liked the brisket sliders (\"the best you've ever tasted,\" said a co-owner) at the restaurant, although I did find some of the meat tough to chew so I put those aside, but found the leftovers fatty and sinewy- a chore to chew- the next day.  Not worth ordering again.  Linda decided to order dessert to share- the baked cinnamon-pecan French toast.  This sweet looked so enticing that I finally broke down and tried it, even though I have a pecan allergy.  I ate the caramelized toast pieces around the nuts (which doesn't prevent an allergic response since the oil is baked throughout the dessert) and found THIS delight addictive!  I hope the kitchen comes up w/ other versions that use other nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, even hazelnuts...

Those of us that sampled the food agreed that while we may not be in a hurry to come back for a meal, us meeting here for happy hour is certainly not out of the question!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here were amazing. I had the baked cinnamon pecan french toast with maple syrup. My boyfriend had cheeseburger sliders both had great flavor. Reasonably priced. Tons of different varieties of drinks both alcholic and non. I got a pomegranate margaritas and the boyfriend got an old fashion. Atmosphere is great. Family friendy and a relaxing place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go to The Duce!  I've been meaning to come here for a long time, but we just never got a chance to do it.  Well finally, after a Dbacks game I suggested to my group to finally check it out.  Glad we all did!

The Duce is a giant historic wearhouse with lots of activities to do.  We were lucky enough to park right out front, and from where you walk in, hint it's in the rear, you walk past a Streamliner trailer that you can order food from.  I've seen the Triple D esposide where Guy loved the mac and cheese muffins, so I had to try them too.  $4 for 9 mini muffians seemed like a great deal.

After putting in my food order, I was told that it was happy hour all day and bottles of beer were half off.  I ended up ordering a round of PBR.  If anyone follows my reviews then you have to know that I'm a craft beer fan, not PBR!  But the Duce only had 2 craft beers on tap which didn't really appeal to me.  At first, I was thinking that The Duce wasn't going to be that good because of the lack of beer choices, but after I ordered a spiked lemonade for my wife at the the main bar I realized that beer doesn't matter here at the Duce, it's all about their speciality drinks!!!!  

The lemonade was amazing.  On our next round I shared a Greyhound with my wife and it was the best!  Just 2 ingredients, freshly squeezed grapefruit and vodka.  It took a few mins to make the drinks, but that's because they are all freshly made.  I was very impressed.  

While waiting for the mac and cheese I saw my friends had grabbed hula hoops and started to play with them.  I went back to pick up the mac and cheese which came in a basket, perfect for sharing.  We then walked around and went to station to station.  I mean, we saw punching bags, so we put on gloves and hit the bags.  Saw corn-hole, then played a doubles game. Then saw foosball and had to play.  

Thats where the fun of the Duce comes in.  You have get involved.  There is really so much to do.  I saw ping pong as well but we were worn out after all of the activities they have to offer.  I'd like to add that the music they were playing was a lot of fun and there were people dancing on their dance floor.  This place is so huge that you can sit right next to the speakers, or in a corner that is quiet, or outside on old fashion lawn chairs.  It's all up to you.

I saw the owner walking around, picking up gloves and putting away weights and talked to him briefly about the activities.  I told him that I really enjoyed what he had done and told him that I would be back.  He shook my hand and thanked me.  He also explained that in the afternoons they offer boxing classes.  That explains the ring they have.lol.

To sum up the Duce...thats hard...I would say if you are wanting a good time with a super cool concept then come here.  I could see if you just went to eat or drink and just sit there then it might not be that good for you..

We all had such a great time that we couldn't stop talking about it.  Too bad they had to close early on our visit, 5:30 for a private wedding.  While we were leaving we saw the wedding party and it appeared that they were actually going to use it as a ceremony and reception place.  My wife and I looked at each other and said that this would have been awesome!"}
{"text":"Really cool place to go with a big group! Love the vibe. I recommend the black and blue mojito!"}
{"text":"Great food, great music and cheap beer! Life doesn't get any better than this. 

Come here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place, so fun! Food can be hit or miss, but cool vibe, great music- unique!"}
{"text":"Ohhh The Duce, I was SO excited to check you out, and you left me heart broken and feeling a bit abused. I never read yelp reviews before I go somewhere because I am a firm believer in trying it for myself, but for those of you that are avid Yelpers, here's a lil review for ya. Myself and my fianc√©, along with our photographer friend and his wife were downtown shooting engagement photos and I heard this place had a very eclectic, hip vibe, totally our style. So we walked in and took a look around. We totally loved the decor and all the funky props. We decided to belly up to the inside bar where there were 4 others waiting. No bartender in sight, not even at the outside bar... We sat for about 10 minutes looking through their amazing craft cocktail list, salivating and hoping to order... Finally a rather surly bartender asked us \"what do you want\"? Ummm hello to you too! We ordered two cranberry cobblers, a Moscow mule, and an orange blossom beer. $42 later we decided to attempt some photos when we were told there is a fee to photograph in their space. We agreed that if the fee was a reasonable amount it would be worth it because the space is THAT COOL. A manager quickly approached us and said the owners do not allow photos to be taken there. Period. The place was not busy so we would not have been bothering anyone, we did not have a big obnoxious set up, just a Nikon and two subjects... This no picture policy was hard for us to comprehend because it's basically free promotion, and isn't word of mouth one of the best ways to promote your establishment?! The manager tried to explain to us that it didn't make sense to her either... Blah blah blah, fake attempt at trying to please us. All in all the service was rude and slow, but the atmosphere was really cool, the beer was flat, but the cocktails were yummy, even after waiting 10 minutes to order, and another 10 minutes for the bartender to make them. I get it, craft takes time, but part of the craft is the experience, rude staff makes for a pretty crappy experience. We tried. I won't be recommending this place, nor will I ever return. Better luck to you all!"}
{"text":"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!

This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. 

The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!

i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it's not packed all the time!"}
{"text":"This place confuses me. There is A LOT happening here between a boxing ring, boutique, dance floor and food. I am not a huge fan, but can see why other people would be. I will likely not return, but if I do I will definitely try the food."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Pub Crawl last night. It's  my new favorite spot. Hipsters galore, an ice cream parlor, great DJ, a boxing ring and I can pick up some vintage salt and pepper shakers....sold! It was 80's night last night and it was totally rad. :) I will come back here on my next trip for sure."}
{"text":"We recently went to the Duce for a company party. We had part of the venue sectioned off with two bars and a dj dedicated to our group. We were served toasted bread with cheese spread and spinach artichoke dip to start, the appetizers kept on flowing with cheese and veggie boards. Eventually the big guns game out! We had roasted chicken with a mashed potato bar, ceasar salad, and sliders (meatball and beef). The beef sliders were just fair but everything else was very good! We had drink tickets for the bar but the drinks were overly muddled with fruit that I would have been very disappointed if I had paid full price for them. The service was absolutely fantastic and on that alone I would highly recommend this venue for an event."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and family. Very unique place, love the music. Will recommend this place. I dont put 5 stars cause the parking in downtown really sucks."}
{"text":"This place is a 11/10 . The people who work here are nice, and the owner shows his appreciation towards customers, I had the cheeseburger sliders, they were really good, and I also had the mac and cheese balls that were outstanding"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance but it's way to hot. I bet if there was air conditioning it would even be busy than it is now. I like that it's kid friendly and my girls had a blast okapi big."}
{"text":"The environment is nice but I didn't get to eat because the waiting was over 1 hour. We opted to eat desert . The vanilla hot milk cake was super dry and is not hot as the name suggests .. I honestly didn't like it at all :("}
{"text":"Just spent my last Friday night here. It was so fun!
The drinks were great and the food was good. Did I mention the drinks were great?!??!? They fresh squeeze the citrus for your drink right then and there. So yummy. 

The food was good, very country down home cookin.
The reason for the 4 stars is the menu. It would be nice to have a few more menu options, like vegan or gluten free (that's not just a salad). Yes, I know how that all sounds, but the option would be nice.

Fun games to play, very relaxed environment. Great decor. Great band.

Good place to go for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Great place!  Dismiss the haters who are whining about the fact that they ran out of ingredients for items they just saw on a Food Network rerun, all of whom raced out with their culinary lemming friends the next day to try the \"as seen on TV\" items.  Get out of your comfort zone and try some of the other great menu items (the egg, tuna and short rib sliders are phenomenal).  Don't ding them just because they've had a run on the one or two items that you had your heart set on because they're the ones that Guy Fieri ate on TV (causing every Phoenix couch potato to rush out to get one for themselves).  This is a very cool space with a great vibe. If you're looking for a great place to chill and enjoy, you've found it.  However, if you're wound tight and like to have everything be very predictable, I recommend that you take your business to Outback Steakhouse or McDonalds."}
{"text":"Maybe I was overcome by my first visit yesterday, but I was shocked that the Duce only had 3.5 stars. I would smash a place if the people were jerks, so I get that review! And yes, the menu is limited, and the food took a while to come out, but that did not make a difference to us, because we loved the atmosphere and the people. 

We had some amazing cocktails created from fresh fruits with vegetable garnishes. The old fashioned was solid. He didn't spare the bourbon and he was easy on the soda. Delicious!

This place is supposedly known for their sliders and I can see why. The sparerib sliders were tender and tasty. They have a lot of options, but we only got to the one. The artichoke dip was average, but I'm not a huge fan of the artichoke flavor (yea, dumb order, then) and it is prevalent. Probably good for artichoke lovers. 

Finally, I had the pot pie. If a place has a pot pie, I'll order it. Also, beware that I rarely meet a pot pie I don't like. This one is no exception. The sauce is on the runny side, but full of flavor. Usually, I like a thicker sauce, but this was good. Also, the crust was amazing and full of fat ... just like it should be. The heat from cooking makes it nice and crispy wherever the crust touches the little glass jar containing the pie. 

Just a couple comments on the building. There is a great space inside the barn and outdoor patio. The barn (maybe I should call it a shed) had a DJ playing really good 80s music, which is normally terrible, but the DJ had great control over the music. And they had hula hoops. Who's does that? Well, about 20 people while we were there. Funny stuff. 

The adjacent building seems like fun with foosball, ping pong and some other things to see, or shop through. They have a boxing ring for something and it appears they have classes for yoga and other exercises.

Loved the Duce. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"The Duce is one of my favorite date night hot spots. The ambiance is unique, theres always something cool going on and theres so much going on you won't find anywhere else. 

Drinks are good at reasonable prices. The food is unique, each thing has a little twist on it. My favorite things are the sweet potato chips and the Kugel Noodle. 

What I really liked / appreciated at the Duce which brought my rating up to 4 stars is the customer service and friendliness of everyone there. 

I saw that on the warehouse side there was a movie screen and projector and asked if I could hold a private date there to screen the favorite movie of the girl I was dating at the time. I spoke with a manager and she asked me what the occassion was and actually let me have the space for FREE. When we came in they had setup a private table for us with fresh flowers and it was the coolest thing ever. 

Although the girl I took on this special date is long gone the memory of taking someones breath away will always remain and for that I will always be a big fan of the duce!"}
{"text":"Excellent time at the burlesque show last night. Chris did a great job organizing and I was happy to meet her. Great Axe the girl with the fire the girl on The Hoop all the dancers and singers even the LL Cool J guy who helped with the ring was awesome. 

Great food, we enjoyed cinnamon cheesecake, they had complementary roasted chicken, the Green-Eyed Lady cocktail special was really really good... Made with fresh lemonade. Lots of different areas to explore and games to play while you're waiting between shows, lots of fun! 

Oh and additional bonus, complimentary valet parking after the evening of fun!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the duce because it has great sliders and cheap beer.  The setting is different but very enjoyable.  My recommendation is to get a brisket sliders with a miller high life.  You will be loving life after that.  If you are looking for a cool, new, but different scene this is the place.  I will be going back for punch and pie."}
{"text":"This place is very laid back. When we walked up we were greeted by a very friendly waiter whom have us menus an that we could sit anywhere than come up an order when ready. The food is really good it's bar/dinner type food sliders side dishes pie  milkshakes. The pie in a jar is fantastic There is a boxing gym inside sometimes the music felt it was being turned up (a little loud)"}
{"text":"Giving three stars for the nice indoor bartenders and delicious grapefruit shammy. Other than that, this was probably one of the more confusing service experiences ever. 
When you walk in, it's not readily apparent what you are supposed to do...it's like you walked in to a hipster house party and everyone else knows the drill. You can sit wherever you want, but you place food and beer orders at one counter and other drink orders at another bar. Then you have a seat and wait to be called to come pick up your food. Well, most people do. I noticed the couple behind us had food brought to them by a staff member. Maybe VIPs, who knows. 
We placed an order for the artichoke dip and the beer can chicken at the outdoor cart. The person taking the order actually had me wait while she indulged this drunk idiot who barged in yammering on about White Castle sliders. She was nice enough, but that was kind of off putting. This is definitely the kind of place where the service improves if you are a regular. Anyway- placed an order at the indoor bar for a shimmy drink and a beer. Bartenders were very nice and engaging and drink was delicious. 
The food itself was a bit of a letdown. The artichoke dip was good, but a really small portion for the price. The beer can chicken was not very meaty but had a delicious glaze. It tasted good, but for $20 you'd think they could have thrown in a side of sauce or something. We weren't even given plates with the chicken and it was hard to eat without making a mess. 
I'd return for the drinks, but the food isn't outstanding and it's overpriced for the portion size."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I was looking for a place to have a quick drink and came in around 1pm. Although I've been here before, it's been many years. Parking is limited but we were lucky to park by the doors today. We were greeted as we came through the door and said we were here only for drinks. There were only a few patrons inside with us but it had a nice vibe. I ordered a Moscow Mule and was happy with it. Although my girlfriends and I was there for a little bit, we were able to catch up without the music being too loud. There is an assortment of things within the building to keep anyone from being bored. We opted to play ping pong & attempted a game of cornhole. I remember thinking that this would be a cool place as a wedding venue. After being there for an hour, we rolled into Happy Hour which was from 3p - 6p. I saw the sign but thought it was funny when the bartender didn't know it was already HH. 
I really like the vibe here and looking forward to coming back with a bigger group and trying out some food."}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party at The Duce, it's a cool, relaxed place and food was delicious.  Keely was our server for the evening.  She was amazing with an undeniable welcoming personality and is very customer focused....\"No\" was not in her vocabulary (not saying it shouldn't be when needed).  She was readily available, incredibly organized ensuring the food was well timed with when our group was arriving, we had lots of food and she helped facilitate the ease of to-go arrangements for our folks and so much more.  Planning the event was not a great experience with the sales/event coordinator we worked with but I put this aside solely due to Keely, the other staff that helped her and the yummy food at the party!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere! The music was great!  Was not a fan of the mac n cheese muffins but the pot pie, brisket slider, and hamburger slider where AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Still live in Flagstaff, still love The Duce, and I'd like to think DJ Luis is still my bff even after all these years. While I love the overall atmosphere and drinks, Luis and his karaoke/music playing prowess are basically why I go out of my way to stop at the Duce whenever I'm in town. He has pretty much any song you' d ever want to hear or sing and he's totally cool, no better place in town to sing karaoke and there's plenty of room on the dance floor to get down!"}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you have 45 minutes to wait for a cold ass fake Chicago style hot dog."}
{"text":"The Duce is always a fun experience! My friend and I went on a Wednesday night for appetizers and drinks. I love a good Mule but decided to go with the bartenders recommendation, a Basil Gimlet with Raspberries. It was beyond delicious! 

We split the mac and cheese muffins and the baked artichoke, asparagus, and goat cheese dip. It came with veggies and tiny pieces of toasts. 

We also experienced karaoke! The DJ was rad and the singers surprisingly good. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am changing this review as we went in with a party of 10 last night & we are very certain 7 of us have food poisoning. The atmosphere is great but I've never gotten sick at a restaurant before. The atmosphere is the best! We took the family & there were swing dance lessons, games, ping pong, hula hoops & more. I'd proceed with caution on the food."}
{"text":"Great Vibes! Big area to do lots of things like hoo la  hoop, play cornhole, shop for some vintage/hipster gear. They have a plethora of PF Flyers to choose from?

Food here is cool, like literally coolMac n cheese muffins, and slider samplers. ..they also have a drink menu that can take you through time as they are specific to the times...

Indoor and outdoor so it fits everyone's needs! Two bars! And the food is served out of an old trailer! I personally love the boxing ring and workout equipment within the area! They hold classes during the week! Come check it out, great for everyone!"}
{"text":"It's a tough call here. The drinks were awesome, the staff was friendly, and the building is pretty darn cool. 

However, it was loud and got louder. And the food...well...it took over an hour and a half for our hot dogs (two of them) and chips and dip. We also ordered the Duce Dip, but they decided not to give it to us. We tried to cancel our order after we passed the 90 minute mark. The cashier was friendly and tried to be helpful. The manager was cranky, rude, and unapologetic. Eventually the found our lost order (most of it), refunded our food, and let us eat our hot dogs. Good on them for trying to make things right. 

The food was okay. Nothing special. The hot dogs tasted like hot dogs, the chips tasted like chips. The prices were fine. 

Had we gotten our food in a timely manner (they estimated it would take 45 min to an hour, which we were okay with) and/of had the manager been as friendly as the staff, all would have been good. 

We would go back again if invited, but probably not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Beer list is bad and I just don't understand this place. It seems to have a lot of potential and is in a cool location - I'll probably come back just for these two reasons. But Ive never understood what brings it all together (could use Lebowski's rug, right?). Lot's going on, and I'm not sure it makes much sense or has the appeal that I'd think the owners are after. Nonetheless, worth popping in, I guess, just once.... just to confirm that Guy Fierri isn't the only one who loves this place. Speaking of Guy Fierri, why do they have his face on a baking pan that hangs on the wall? I think that turned me off more than the country-meets-RnB dancing that was going on when my wife and I stopped in last weekend. And why did they get rid of the Rock Springs pie bar? That was one good thing about this place that I miss. Oh well."}
{"text":"Brandon is an awesome bartender! He makes the best basil gimlet! He gives The Duce a quality name that convinced our group to come back the next night. Love this place! It's must experience!"}
{"text":"Insanely fun place for a group. Food was so delicious! We got a little of everything but missed th chicken pot pie because they were sold out. Mac and cheese muffins and brisket sliders were a must! Cocktails were super strong and tasty. Would definitely recommend for anyone in Scottsdale or Phoenix"}
{"text":"Fun place to hangout with friends, play backyard games, have some cheap beer.   It is open air more or less, so bring your heat tolerance with you.  One fun part (besides the boxing ring, ping pong, cornhole games is the food truck permanently installed in the middle of the venue."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place of ALL TIME! It's the most adorable and surprising place you will stumble upon in Phoenix--I can guarantee you! First, you'll walk into the cutest little courtyard, decked out with a vintage trailer car that serves you food-cart style. When you place your order, they will ask you for a creative nickname for which to announce your order by, which always makes for a great laugh later when you hear all the hilarious names called when the orders are ready.

But the awesomeness does not end there!! Oh no, not even close. If you continue on indoors, into their garage/warehouse-like area that simply looks like it houses more seating for customers, you will discover that it's so much more. Once you turn the corner, you'll find that this place is HUMONGOUS. Not only does it have a bunch of quirky little items and clothing on sale, there are also vintage decorations decking out the entire room, plus a real boxing ring (whaaaat???)!

The food is also great! Their sliders are delicious, and their drinks are served in mason jars (very in-keeping with their vintage vibe). I've also had their mac & cheese muffins as well as their sweet potato crisps, which are all scrumptious. I've only come here during the daytime for lunch, when there aren't a lot of people, so it's a good time to relax and soak in the ambience of the place. But I know they have a lot of interesting activities on different nights, and they also have karaoke!

The Duce is just such a creative and unique spot. Duce yourself a favor and come check this place out! ;)"}
{"text":"We were here for a private event and had half of the building. I liked the wide, open space to mix and mingle with ~300 folks in our group. We had two bars and the milkshake booth in our roped off area. Agree with other reviews that this place tries to be many different things... beer, lemonade, milkshakes, plus gift shop, boxing ring. It goes on. Seems like the venue will try anything to see what sticks. We had apps and pulled pork sandwiches. all were tasty... when hot. Wished they would've paced out the distribution through the night, vs. leaving everything on the tables early on, so there was only cold food available later. Like the look/feel of the place and the valet parking was a nice touch."}
{"text":"The Duce is such a cute place with a lot of potential. When you walk in you really aren't quite sure as to what you should do or where you should go. There is no one there to direct you. As you continue you into the warehouse there is a \"hostess\" stand on your right that helps you. It would be better if this station was at the front entrance. I was unimpressed with the game offerings with only two ping pong tables, foosball, and some corn hole. There were also a lot of children running around. If I go back it'll probably be later in the evening to avoid all of the children."}
{"text":"I love the Duce! Such a fun place with something for everyone. Seriously- they have corn hole (aka Duce bag), ping pong, a dance floor (they play like the best of the 90s), a boxing ring and a store. And you can dress super casual! Love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with an eclectic atmosphere with much to keep the eye entertained including a boxing ring. A good mix of classic rock and pop music was lingering in the background in an old brick and tin warehouse setting. We made our way back to an outdoor eating area that hosts an old shiny aluminum  travel trailer for a kitchen with  rustic wood benches for seating and shabby chic d√©cor.

We ordered our food from the counter a cheeseburger sliders and a brat. And here's why I didn't tack a few more stars on the review. It took a long time for the food to come out, over 30 minutes. Which seems like a very long time in an uncrowded environment on a cool and breezy Saturday. The food arrived and is served in a very basic way, no fries pickles or garnishes . My son said the Brat was good, the sliders were okay but bland and the bread was dry, some mayo and seasoning would help. Add a couple of diet cokes and tip and the bill was $26 seemed a bit high for basic food with minimal service. I'm not complaining as I like this place and hope to go back for beers but I think more care could be taken in food prep and delivery time."}
{"text":"What a unique place and setting for games and fun. Our group ordered drinks which were very good from the mojitos to the bloody Mary's all served in Mason Jars. Took us 30 minutes of patiently waiting for a food server before finding out we needed to go outside and order at the trailer. This explains the annoying, loud calls of names over the speaker system which ruins all songs playing and makes conversation impossible. The games, Foosball, Cornhole, Ping Pong and Hula Hoops looked like it would be fun but each was occupied by 6-14 year old unsupervised children. (A Bar with Daycare) We ordered food which they were out of chicken, brisket and pot pies so we opted for the short rib and cheeseburger sliders which were ok except for the stale and crusty buns , another had a hot dog which was good and one ordered the cheeseburger sliders with egg but the cook forgot the eggs. We had apps of the mac n cheese muffins which were tasty but overpriced for what you get. The 45 minute wait to get food after ordering, the missing items as well as the lack of quality on a slow Sunday evening is the reason for only 2 stars. The drinks were great, the place seems fun and interesting but next time I want to spend $400.00 on my group of friends, it won't be here."}
{"text":"Such a fresh, fun place! It was enjoyable to hula hoop, play ping pong and corn hole while waiting for your food. The vibe was totally shabby chic. I would have given it five stars but it was quite pricey (easily $10-$16 a meal) and I got my food as nearly everyone else in my group was finishing. We ordered on the same ticket! I would still recommend this to friends and return. :)"}
{"text":"Came to The Duce today and it was a great! Other than the wait times for food, the atmosphere for brunch is so much fun. Between the random hula hopping, workout session in the boxing ring, and oldies music, you will not be disappointed coming here."}
{"text":"The reviews are great but reality is this is just a normal burger place. The mac n cheese muffins are just muffin rolled in crunch and baked in muffin tin. Nothing special. The clothing is way way over priced. My suggestion is to skip it. I went because i saw it on triple D. Not impressed. The pot pie was not the best I've ever had. It was delicious though.  I like Marie calendars better."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Pop the Soda Shop I had to come by here.  I had the original Dr. Pepper and my hubby a chocolate shake.  He makes his sodas fresh at his old school soda fountain.  Both were delicious.

It is an interesting little place with a lot of different things going on.  I'll be back for a soda and perhaps for a meal one day."}
{"text":"Love this spot, it's a converted warehouse so there is plenty of room. The place has a great atmosphere awesome drinks (best Old Fashions in the game), good spot to go with a group. If you want to experience a truly unique bar ethis is the spot for you. It's a breath of fresh air from the Scottsdale, Arcadia or Tempe scene."}
{"text":"Dropped in on Saturday night, cocktails are always fresh and perfect. All the different spaces offer a little something for every mood. With the cooler weather there isn't a bad spot in the house. Great service all the way around."}
{"text":"Boasting faux-southern comfort food and old-timey vibes, The Duce is a jack-of-all trades sort of establishment and event space left perhaps marred by service and environmental issues. 

Make no mistake, there's a lot going on here. A LOT. We're talking (kick)boxing, yoga, ping pong, weights, Latin dance nights...it's a pretty vast warehouse, so they're constantly innovating ways to utilize it all.

I'd stepped in on a sweltering Wednesday evening to meet up with some colleagues. no more than 10 steps in, an employee ran...literally RAN behind me screaming \"wait! You can't be here!\" It turned heads. I'd stumbled onto a private event, rendering all that fun stuff I'm talking about unavailable. How they were so sure so fast that I wasn't supposed to be in a section with no signs and no name tags of sort is beyond me, but the unwanted attention was actually kinda embarrassing. I felt uncomfortable in less than 30 seconds--a record for sure--but I don't hold a grudge. Moving on. 

I walked around and found my table of 15 or so. The table was nice and spacious, leaving unobstructed views of all those fun attractions we'd save for another day. Reserving a portion of an establishment for a private event is cool. Alienating other paying customers by having absolutely no games of any sort on the other side of The Duce came across as poor planning at best. There were menus here, but no one is taking your orders. You wait in line at a trailer outdoors and place them. So while I waited for my order, I visited the bar. It has a decent beer selection, and a great assortment of everyday cocktails like the Grasshopper, Old Fashioned, etc. These aren't the most stiff, which is great since they're huge and served in mason jars. The bar was actually my favorite part of this experience, along with the very cool DJ. 

When you order food, you're not given a number or anything...they just call your name. From where they call it, I have no clue! I never heard mine and neither did most of my colleagues. We just had to kinda see someone who ordered before us grab their meal and then hope ours was ready shortly thereafter. My sliders, however filling, were just OK, with rock-hard rolls that disappointed everyone at my table who ordered them. 

The disappointment doesn't stop there. 

Most (keyword: MOST) of our party momentarily left for the dance floor for a quick round of happy birthday singing. In that time, staff swooped in and began cleaning up at our table. My friend's food was thrown away! We had a couple people left there at the table and were by no means finished, but they were just so eager to take care of this that writing an account of it irritates me. Naturally, my friend was upset and complained like \"heeey you threw away like half my dinner\". She was met by some prick who did nothing but repeat \"WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE IT BETTER\" several times, in perhaps the most annoyed, almost hostile tone I've heard from an industry worker who is clearly in the wrong. They did not bother comping her meal. 

The food is so-so, and I think the heat makes staff more brusque than courteous. So do I think The Duce has potential to be cool? Yes. I'll totally give them another shot...eventually. I really want to believe I'd have a better experience dancing or something here instead of just eating. But my co-workers probably won't, and and they're unlikely to suggest it again. Until then, I can drink and dance in cooler places downtown."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer* we went on a Summer Night when it quite possibly was 190 degrees inside this place - That said, the fact that I'm still giving it 3 stars should be seen as a testament to the Duce's charm.  And by \"charm\" I mean 32 ounce Old Fashioned's.  

The Duce is a cool spot on the south side of downtown Phoenix.  With the outside look of an old warehouse and the inside look of a full service bar that just happens to have a boxing gym, ping pong / cornhole stadium and a boutique inside of it - the Duce is a great place to come away with an interesting story.  (*second disclaimer* I am not drunk while writing this review, I am giving you an honest description)

I can't speak to food, as I was drinking my dinner this evening - but I can say that if you're looking for a place to drink a meal, they serve cocktails in 32oz mason jars which are up to the task.  Also, when I ordered a 32 oz greyhound - the bar tender split and squeezed the grapefruit directly into the vodka before my eyes.  Top Quality bar, No complaints on service.  

I want to complain about it being hot.  Partly because it was, but mostly because I'm self centered - BUT then I remember that the wait staff was still attentive and friendly even though they 1) were probably hotter than the customers were and 2) they have to deal with it day in / day out while we are able to come and go as we please - so I won't.  

I will come here again, preferably when it's under 100 degrees outside - and I have a feeling it will earn a few more stars in my book."}
{"text":"This is really a huge warehouse with many different bars and seating areas.   They make excellent hand crafted cocktails using fresh fruit & herbs.  The beef brisket was very tender.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Spend time checking out all the different areas of this cool place.  We are going back today before heading home."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, most recently a Saturday night with a group of friends killing time before we could go to a nearby cocktail lounge. The place was lively, we were greeted with 80s music as we walked in and made our way to a bar (there are a few located throughout the area). I got a strawberry limeade with was just ok, the bartender was fun to watch and the ambience was cool so it made up for the lackluster drink. There was a dance area going in one side, people hanging out and talking at another area and a section for games. Overall the space is great, but the drink wasn't anything special. I still chose to give 4 stars because it's a fun environment to hang out in for a bit."}
{"text":"What a fun place to be! I've been to The Duce a couple of times - 1st one was for an art show event and 2nd time for a casual Sunday afternoon. The space is large and there's various things to do here: bars, desserts, food, games, and more.

For brunch, I had the scrambled eggs and fresh-squeezed lemonade. The eggs were organic and a large serving, but they were ok. The lemonade was refreshing for a warm morning. I do wish that the food menu could be bigger. 

We wanted to grab some desserts at the dessert bar, but after standing around for 10 mins and looking for someone to serve us, nobody ever came. It was not a busy day at all so I was surprised .

Overall, I think this is a good place for drinking and hanging out with friends, but I wouldn't come here to eat."}
{"text":"The Duce is a pretty cool spot.
Taking on this huge warehouse is quite a challenge, but I think they did it nicely.  
The airstream they serve the food from is a cool touch, marking your order with a nickname (they have a list of some if you can't think of one) is kinda neat too.
The old timey bar, soda jerk fountain, and boxing ring are cool touches.
The drinks, while pricey, are pretty darn good.  My husband loves a good old fashioned, and its a pain to find one, the Duce didn't really deliver there, but their Tom Collins made up for it!
Everyone was friendly and fun.
The food was good.  The sliders were amazing and I will be coming back for those corn coins, so so good.
I also hear they have swing dancing on Tuesdays, can't wait to check that out.

Down sides:  the old fashioned needs some work, its was unbearably hot when the gigantic fan turned off for no apparent reason, its was just bearable when it was on, but that to be expected in an old ware house during and Arizona summer.
Also, the corrugated steel bathroom stalls make me feel like I am hunkering down for the zombie apocalypse when all I need to do is tinkle."}
{"text":"Courtney's drinks taste like pure happiness.  I'll go back just for her amazing mojitos! The Duce has a great vibe with hula hoops and corn hole.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique places I've ever had a drink at. From the triple D representation to the boxing ring and bag toss/corn hole it's worth having a drink at.

Unique libations w/ a twist. The food wasn't for me but I enjoyed the vibe.

Good for groups"}
{"text":"- Pretty cool environment. Fun, open space.  Surprisingly large and not too crowded
- Could use more and larger TVs
- Service is friendly (and persistent!)
- Parking sucks
- The food was very good.  The dips, especially that magic cheese one were savory.  The spinach one was a little watery.  Nice variety of sliders.  I particularly like the one that was like pot roast on a bun.  The sausage one was relatively flavorless.  The burger had a nice salty bite"}
{"text":"I joined @PatrickEm and @PaulValach at @TheDucePHX for brunch this morning.

I had their cinnamon pecan french toast, but without the pecans.

It was simply amazing!

Amanda was our server, and she epitomizes what I think a server should be. Keep her around, Duce!

Also had fresh-squeezed orange juice. Delicious!

I think the Duce would do well to add a few fans, just to move the air a bit.

But I really enjoy this place, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.. it has decent food and a good drink selection.. nice place to hang out With ur friends.."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing atmosphere!! The food is by far my favorite in phoenix! And the ping pong tables along with the corn hole provides such amazing entertainment!!"}
{"text":"The positives; the place is cool, decorating is on point, the mix of clientele was fun, the amount of seating was perfect, the variety of bars was excellent, the food tasted fantastic. Overall the vibe and flow was very easygoing. Negatives; we did separate food tickets and asked if our sample mac and cheese muffins could come out first. We had ordered the beer butt chicken and were told there would be an hour wait, no problem since we would be snacking on the muffins while we waited. The cashier said this was how to do it, separate tickets. Nope, all the food arrived at once. We had one muffin each (2) and decided to have the chicken, corn and potatoes because they were getting cold. We loved the chicken, I'll bring my own chicken shears next time because cutting it with a serrated steak knife is silly. We pushed the ten muffins aside intending to get a to-go box. Nope, bus-lady came by and took them away. I had turned my back to see a ping pong match heat up and she just swooped in. Left a bunch of trash but the metal vessels were all gone. So much for my ten mac and cheese muffin breakfast. 
The food is really good, I really enjoy the atmosphere, I will return and be better prepared for the minor shortcomings."}
{"text":"Very fun vintage place with awesome food! Brisket is delightful the drinks are fruity and good! A nice place for a fun afternoon!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I want to love The Duce. It has an awesome concept, and I love the atmosphere in the place, however, my experience, has not been the best. My biggest issue is the booze. I get the retro muddled feel, but on a bloody mary? Not quite the best. Also the bartender took forever. I want to try the food, but I fear similar experiences. The staff in the store area was super nice, and they have a cool assortment of goods. Hopefully my next trip will yield better results, however for now its just a-ok."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself at this place!! I absolutely loved the strawberry limeade drink I had. I never tried the food but the atmosphere and drinks were totally worth visiting!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and enjoyed it... Then I had dinner there. Pretty terrible. I ordered a Moscow mule and it was unrecognizable as that beverage, the waitress never brought the silverware I requested, and instead of delivering my food to the table where my dining companions had already received their food, my food was left at the bar in the midst of all the swing dancing as it got cold until finally someone announced it over the loud speaker for me to come get. Do not get the tuna or tuna melt sliders. It was basically tuna straight from a can, sprinkled with some cheese and a little mayo on hard bread. It was cold and gross."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of atmosphere, that's for sure. Sixty year old mid-century dinettes? Check! Vintage marble soda counter? Check! Antique phone booth? Check! Boxing ring? Check! But at the end of the night it's all just an un-themed collection of hipster nonsense. The drinks are heavy on sour fruits like grape fruit and lemon with a scant spoonful of agave syrup to \"sweeten\" it. They have well over two dozen drinks on their menu, and the four of them that I tried were undrinkable. If, on the other hand, you like your liquor served straight with bitter citrus pulp, you will definitely love this place. How is it that hipsters can take a cocktail like a Sidecar and make it into something that tastes like prison Pruno? As for their food, I am pretty sure everything has some form of goat cheese in it so that's a plus if you like goat cheese. So in summary, go for the boxing, stay for the Pruno."}
{"text":"The Duce was a really good experience for my family and I. At first, we felt like we did not belong there on a Friday afternoon due to the slow feel. I guess we were some of the first people there. However, once we got through the order process with Bree's help and Hannah taking care of our organic drink order, we felt that the staff took really good care of us.  The food was awesome and the atmosphere was fun, yes, even for the kids.  We tried a new menu item, the Apple/Pear crisp for dessert, and it too was delicious. Overall I would recommend The Duce if you are looking for a different, laid back, good flavorful food experience.  Oh, and bring you appetite."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a Saturday - what a great find!  We all tried some of their vodka berry cocktails which are served in a mason jar - all of them were tasty and could easily have had a few of them.  They have ping pong, corn hole, and many more games.  Also, they have a cool little market that sells quality shirts and other stuff.  The highlight was probably the service - we had someone in our group celebrating a birthday.  I asked the server if she could put some candles in their bacon mac n cheese muffins and she did that and helped us sign happy birthday! The Duce rocks."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! Random layout, you can do anything from play ping pong, to drink, or karaoke. There's something for everyone. 

I really appreciated how awesome the staff was. They have a shop there, and Ashley was running it. She is the most adorable person ever! so sweet, friendly, and professional, she could practically be running the place. 

The owner is awesome too. Just a great atmosphere, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For a hangout drinking joint, this place is a good alternative to the typical bars. The atmosphere is very casual. The music they play is an eclectic arrangement from whatever time period. It's not too loud, and it's brightly lit compared to most other places. There are activities, such as, ping pong and cornhole to keep things fun.

The food and drinks are quite pricey, but they use fresh squeezed fruit juices if the drink calls for it. So it's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Had a blast! I had never been before and went out for margaritas and dancing. The DJ was great played a nice variety of music. The bartender was a little rude he was more interested in some girls at the bar. I didn't let it ruin the fun, I actually started going to the other end to another bartender. I had no idea until now it was also a restaurant. I loved the retail items you could purchase, T-shirt's, hats, jerseys etc. It was a really unique concept. My friends and I danced with hula hoops that they provided while on the dance floor. Next time I will try the food and hopefully it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Went on Tues. evening around 8.  Free valet.  Fresh squeezed juices.  Warehouse...Other reviewers who have rated it high have said it all.  I just wanted to add that if you go during the summer months, it is HOT!  They have swamp coolers that work hard, but don't quite make it cool everywhere.  Neat that on this night, they had a huge line up of bands and there were two stages.  While one band played, the other set up so there was literally no downtime.  Would like to go back."}
{"text":"The Duce. Really like this place and becoming a regular. Sadler is a great conversationalist behind the bar and Frankie's awesome. Great spot on weekends and weekdays when it's more low key."}
{"text":"Awesome place.

Warehouse style.

Good tequila.

Ping pong.

Bags.

Good pre game place!"}
{"text":"We went to The Duce to kill some time before our flight home based on seeing them on DDD.  We weren't disappointed.  We tried the Mac and Cheese bites, as well as the Shrimp in a Jar and Sliders.  All were delicious.  The bartender working in the afternoon was very helpful giving us the lay of the land and making a great drink.  She even remade it without being asked to because she wasn't 100% happy with it.  I'd for sure come back here.  Cool place with a neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Duce is a  great place to get a taste of the urban side of dt Phoenix. It is a converted warehouse that is a food trailer/bar/thrift store/ice cream parlor/boxing ring? Their bartender is a DOLL, probably from the same era as when the warehouse was built. There are ping pong tables and bags set up inside, and they have different events on different nights. This place is a hodgepodge of different things and definitely hard to describe. Your best bet is to try it out for yourself.

Overall. The Duce is perfect if you want to try somewhere new and get a different feel for this city."}
{"text":"After an evening at the Duce, when I told my husband about this place, I felt like \"Stefan\" from SNL (Please note that all of the below are 100% true from my single 3-hour visit):

\"Phoenix's new hotspot is called, 'The Duce.' They have EVERYTHING - wedding rehearsals, sorority costume date parties, fancy fruit drinks in mason jars, old refrigerators, a boxing ring, 13-year-old youth group members dancing to the oldies, hula hooping, lots of signs written on chalkboards, local celebrity Lin Sue Cooney, a newborn baby, an indoor food truck that takes 70 minutes to serve a hamburger, karaoke, a giant gift shop, ice cream floats, and lots of bearded twentysomethings.\" 

I see how this COULD be fun, in theory. However, in practice, there was just way too much going on and this place can't seem to figure out what it is. It honestly seemed like someone spent about a month pinning everything they saw on Pinterest and just threw it into a single location.

All this said, at 35, I'm probably older than their target demographic, so maybe I'm just crotchety and out of touch. :)"}
{"text":"\"The Duce\" Great Food, Great Cocktails, Great Atmosphere, Great Spot! I would definitely come back again. My husband found this place on Yelp for date night and to my surprise he found a gem here in Phoenix. Love it!"}
{"text":"The duce exceeds expectations! Went out to Phoenix  with a handful of friends and we all had a hell of a good time. The setup of the place was very creative. It felt like a huge bar with gym like qualities intermixed! Such a fun atmosphere with a good variety of people enjoying themselves! There was literally something there for everyone.

 I didnt eat much but the drinks were made to perfection! The cranberry cobbler was my favorite but they had tons to chose from! The staff was very accommodating. I actually had the pleasure of meeting the owner Steve. Very cool guy! My friends and I were hanging out by the ring and were beating up the punching bag when Steve asked if I'd like to box in the ring with him! That alone was a thrilling experience. Very genuine to take the time to treat the customers with such hospitality! But besides all that they had Foosball, ping pong tables, and hulla hoops set up in the middle for entertainment! There was a good variety of tunes and I really liked the different sitting areas they had available!

 I'll be coming back for sure.. I need to try their food and sweets and I want to see how good I can box before all the drinks! Seriously if you haven't been here, take a group of people and check it out. I throughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great on everything. Handmade drinks with natural ingredients made right in front of you. The food portions are small but delicious. Coolest inside of a bar or restaurant I've ever been too, similar to Camp Social but bigger with a boxing ring."}
{"text":"Interesting place, lots to do and look at. 
I love places like this but not when the drinks are around $8-10 for a pint of beer.
Service was poor when we went, two bartenders at a not very busy bar, one was more focused on chatting up women at the end of the bar while the other did all the work."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Sunday evening... It wasn't busy but waited close to an hour for food... Half of the food was cold (I think they forgot our order)... But the drinks were good. Music was to loud..."}
{"text":"This place is an out of the way jewel! A little hole in the wall that takes you back in time through their 50's, 60's, and 70's atmosphere! The food is excellent. They serve American fare in fun packages. The flavor is mouthwatering and the portions perfect!"}
{"text":"I came in with 6 people and ordered Chicken Sausage slider. The cups for water were all wet and looked dirty, the place also was swarmed with flies. Everyone got their food except me. So I know they might have forgot my order. I talked to the cashier girl who got my order to check if they do. She comfirmed they're making it so i continue to wait. After everyone done eating, my order still hasnt come. I checked with the cashier girl again and she finally said the kitchen staff lost my order. I gave this place 2 stars since the manager was decent enough to get my order to-go with an extra apple pie and get me a refund as I demanded. I highly doubt that I would ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Great shakes, ok food and service sucks. It doesn't matter what time of day you go service is always slow.."}
{"text":"Cool place definitely would not have come here if I hadn't seen it on yelp. Looks like a dump on the outside but they definitely get their clientele through word of mouth. Nice place to grab a few drinks and hang with friends or significant others they have games like pong pong and cornhole which is also cool. I only give it three stars because I'm a beer guy and they don't have 1 ipa and their selection is less then stellar. It would be nice to see them add some craft beers to the menu but their cocktail list is extensive. Also it gets pretty hot in their in the summer they have fans but it only helps a little. Will definitely be back in the fall"}
{"text":"Before coming to the Duce, I had heard some decent compliments about the atmosphere and drinks.

I don't live close by for the night life, but a co-worker and I decided to try it out for lunch.

I am not a teacher, but I would give the food a \"C.\" We decided to split the slider sampler. This proved to be messy and was no fault of the restaurant. It is hard to cut a meatball in the bread... And the short ribs... Even the chicken sausage. Aside from that, the food was just ok.

The tuna was meh, not like mamas! The short ribs were ok. The chicken sausage: ok. Just all of it was ok. 

The highlights for the experience was the staff: super friendly and helpful. I like that there are drink stations around that I can help myself to. The building and decorations are really great. I can certainly see why it would be so much fun to hang out and enjoy company here.

Unfortunately, the lunch was just not the best. Not for the price at least. I would try it again, but at night, when I am not hungry."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Loved the booze. Loved the vintage, hip vibe throughout the whole place! Can't wait until the future hubs starts wanting to go to more baseball games this summer! We're definitely going to hit up this place a lot! :o)"}
{"text":"This place wasn't quite what I expected. I had heard good things but this place just confused me. You walk in and you're immediately in some kind of shop. And once you walk through that there is a wide open warehouse room and a lot of long picnic tables. I finally found the bar which seemed disproportionately small for the size of this place. It got very crowded fast so I decided to order a bucket of PBRs for my girlfriend and I. I could see the place went further back where I've heard food was, but after finishing the bucket we left. I wouldn't come back, not because of anything negative, it's just not my cup of tea. Seems like a hybrid dive bar/club. So it definitely seems geared towards younger people."}
{"text":"We had 2 company dinners at the Duce. Food was ok and the service was slow. The main problem was manager. He was rude and very uncooperative. He made it clear he didn't care about us or our business. Avoid the Duce because of the manager."}
{"text":"I've been here three times...

First time, I came on a Saturday night...it was completely dead...DJ, Karaoke..there were maybe five people here...the fresh squeezed drinks are a good concept. Clothing is ridiculously overrated and priced. As for the food...The sliders were okay. Not half bad...

Second time, I had take-out since the I thought the sliders were decent the first time...but, I unfortunately got the food and it was super greasy and cold...only good thing were the cupcakes for dessert...

Third time, I said maybe it was a fluke...I'll try to bring my kids..since it's suppose to be \"family friendly\"...took my kids to the ice cream bar or what not. No one was there to help us. Had to walk around the place, finally found someone to help us and the customer service well, let's just say they were obligated and it showed..also met the owners..decent people BUT it seems they allow anyone to work here. Overheard employees In the trailer where the food is prepped and cooked...not trying to eavesdrop, but there are felon's on probation working here. Not ideally \"family\" friendly. Maybe they should rethink their hiring process. Makes me wonder if they allow sex offender's to work here, too? Guess they don't require background checks..."}
{"text":"Anything goes at The Duce.  This is a warehouse, trailer park, and backyard all rolled into one.  Everything in The Duce is vintage.  I love the picnic table concept and food truck kitchen.  The food has some serious down-home feel to it.  They have Mac & Cheese muffins, Sweet Potato Chips and Noodle Kugel with Granny Smith apples.  I didn't know what Kugel was but it was delicious.  The Chicken Sausage Sliders are my favorite.  The Duce knows how to makes some serious cocktails.  They use fresh ingredients and serve up their cocktails in Manson jars.  I don't think I've had a drink on their menu I didn't like.  Old Fashioneds and Moscow Mules are my favorite and The Duce's creations are perfect!  The Duce is a unique place that will be great to meet friends before a game or just a night out for drinks."}
{"text":"Very, very hip, trendy place to hang out.  They have it all here. Great place for families and hipsters alike.  The shopping looks really cool with vintage clothing galore.  The PF Flyers were especially interesting.  Tried the famliy pack of Sliders, Brisket, Sausage, Meatball and Tuna. They also have Egg and Chicken I think.  Also tried the Apple Fritter desert.  Very good.  The night I went was the first night they tried music.  it seemed to go over well and the owner, Steve told me they plan to have more music acts in the coming months. 

Since I mentioned Steve, the owner, Let's go ahead and mention the staff.  The second I walked into the place I was greeted by an employee.  Welcomed and given the nickel tour.  The Staff at the bar and the trailer-kitchen (More about that in a min) were very friendly.  

The creative use of the space was so interesting. Its one of those places that the first time you are there you just sit and look around the space.  Vintage records hang from the wall, An authentic Hamm's Bear beer statue. Original Brick walls and exposed building trusses. 

Now to the vintage Airstream travel trailer.  They use it as an outdoor kitchen. You order your food from a picnic table and they make it in the trailer/kitchen.  Very Cleaver.  

For me, the best part was the vintage cocktails. I have been reading a lot about the trend to recreate old style cocktails that for one reason or another are not made anymore. Drinks like the old-fashion, the Cuba Libre, or Rusty Nail.  I could go on about the authentic soda fountain, the bakery and ice cream if I had more time. I will just say go to the Duce and see for yourself 

One slight bummer is the prices.  Slightly expensive. $8 bucks for 3 sliders.  $10 for a desert that was pretty small.  Cocktails are all $10 and above. They seem to try to offer some inexpensive alternatives $3 for PBR's and Hamm's beer.  That may be a fun novelty but the reason those beers are nearly defunct is because they suck. I guess if you want to save some cash by chocking down some horrible beer, Knock  yourself out.  But if you want to get something decent, you need to be prepared to pay just a little more at the Duce. 

All in all I highly recommend this place. Go check it out for yourself.  I know I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The Duce defies my expectations of what it exactly is... hipster event space? restaurant? bar? 

Reminds me of the Step Brothers movie quote \"So many activities!\". Perfect for anyone with ADD and/or a short attention span. Corn hole, boxing ring, dancing, foosball, and ping pong!! Oh and a fun hula hoop contest!

One of my friends organized an outing for our Meetup group to have \"adult homecoming\" one weekend evening. He negotiated a few drink tickets + finger food apps + reserved table space as such, and it was roughly $30/person. Compared to their menu, I figured that was a great deal! 

Unfortunately it was also the night of a Dbacks game, so the parking & local driving situation was horrendous- no space for the valet service to take our car and my friend who drove had to park blocks away... and of course they don't have much of a parking lot to begin with. 

Once we got into the building they gave our group wristbands to identify us... although since we were all fairly well-dressed it wasn't hard to point us out. Our tables were altogether with the food beautifully displayed. The plates were odd- just like a plain metal mini serving tray. Lots of bites including their famous Mac n cheese muffins, bruschetta, dips, and sliders! 

The most disappointing part of the night was their drinks. Yes, they are served in really cool mason jars and their bartenders know how to make slinging them into a show, but the taste left a lot to be desired. Between my friends and I, we tried a lot on the menu (sampling amongst ourselves the Strawberry Limeade, Duce Limeade, Moscow Mile, Cranberry Cobbler, Mojito, Basil Gimlet). If the drink wasn't bland, it just wasn't that good. Not really sure what could be done to make them better. It was the one thing that stood out above the fun night that was a buzz kill."}
{"text":"Love the concept! I've been to the Duce a number of times for get togethers. Huge eclectic space, awesome comfort food (features on Diners, Dives and Drive in) churned out from an airstream trailer, and hand crafted prohibition Era cocktails. 

While its a great place to visit during the fall, winter and spring, we found it is not as comfortable during the summer. Because its an old warehouse- they rely on fans to cool... Which can make summer months sweltering. 

Drinks: hand crafted, and served in mason jars!

Food: love their wide array of sliders. I had heard great things about their macaroni and cheese. While at first I was hesitant about fried macaroni and cheese balls, I discovered their awesomeness."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The owner Steve, rocks!  It's an eclectic mix of 1950's antiques, movies in the background, boxing ring, outdoor patio, unique clothes line and forthcoming \"Pie Hole\" for fresh pies!  He has a blend of everything for everyone and the atmosphere is local, urban, energetic, and tons of space!  Food and drinks are excellent and Steve talks to everyone!

If that isn't enough, go on a Sunday for his Punch & Crunch Brunch!  That is a workout you won't forget and work up an appetite for a great brunch!  You aren't a Phoenix Hipster unless you've been here!"}
{"text":"Great place - love how cute the venue is! Got the mac & cheese muffins & sliders (comes with 3 of them) for 2 people which is more than enough. Sliders were delicious however mac & cheese muffins were good but not as amazing as described in these reviews. They were fried so they turned out a bit oily...

Cute place however... I did spot a few cockroaches scurrying around on the ground :( I was in the outdoor seating area...but still was not a pleasant sight."}
{"text":"The deuce has a pretty cool spot to hang out with friends on the weekend or even for happy hour. drinks are handcrafted with fresh local ingredients which is also a plus for me. I love their mules and  Margaritas are on point. Definitely go on happy hour.. take advantage of the cheaper prices.  in my opinion they are a little pricey. I think it's cute how you can go up and order your food and give them a fake name for an interesting dining experience,  but  make sure you are paying attention, can be easy to miss your food order. And who wants cold food? I'm obsessed with their macaroni and cheese muffins they are so delicious so flavorful that's really the only thing that I order when I go. It's cool because this spot is close to home, so it's convenient little spot to drop in if I want to have a nice drink.  I bring my daughter here sometimes and we play table tennis so it could also be a cool spot to bring teenagers or even little ones to indulge in cornhole as well."}
{"text":"I love that this place. Is an old warehouse converted to be a night club. Early in the evening the place wasn't as packed. There is a nice little dance floor for some fun and pool tables in the back.  Also available is a small shop for t-shirts and other items. The bartender I dealt with was not the most personable. There is great outdoor patio and indoor seating so large or small groups can just chill during their night."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like to unwind on the weekend nights! The ambiance was great! There is a little bit of everything! From playing games to dancing and eating."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an interesting, fun and all-round party of a time, then come to The Duce. Seriously, the environment is pretty out of this world. The owner is a trip. He is really invested in this place. From the Milkshake bar to the boxing ring to the wing dances to the face floor. This vintage gem in the heart of downtown will leave you wanting more. The only reason i am leaving 4 and not 5 stars, is that the food could be better."}
{"text":"Pricey drinks and food but an undeniable different spot to go to. Wish they had cocktail waitresses but I'm just being picky. You definitely need to hunt down your own drinks and food. Drinks are garnished generously and you will pay for it. The spot is definitely worth going to if you want outside of the regular."}
{"text":"I dare you to try and describe the Duce in under 50 words. By far the most unique bar/venue/ restaurant in Phoenix.  The food is really good. Chicken apple sliders, milkshake shots, hand made organic drinks, brisket, schlitz beer, hamms beer, PBR etc. all excellent. 

We love it so much we decided to have our wedding there. Everyone was fantastic to us from start to finish. We could not be happier that we had our wedding there. Our pictures turned out AMAZING!!!!  And I say that as the groom. You can't imagine how pumped my wife is. All ofthe guests were blown away by the place. 

Andi and Steve are true visionaries. What they have done with an old produce wear house is almost a miracle. Ellen, who helped us plan everything, was fantastic. Thy have turned a once sketchy part of Phoenix into a gem. 

Everyone in Phoenix has to at least try this place. If you don't fall in love its not for you. Stay at the ultra lounge you are used to. It's creative, unique, and incredibly welcoming. 

Yes, drinks can take a while to make, but they are hand squeezed juices and organic cocktails. Somethings take minute."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and thought I'd give it a try. Can't say I'll go back. The food was gross and expensive. I got the brisket sliders and they were gloppy and sickeningly SWEET.  The people seemed nice enough. Very groovy decor. I wandered around a bit. Not much was going on as it was 6 on a Friday night. They had some groovy clothing on sale and there were vintage tank tops for $120. I think my eyes may have been playing tricks on me. I'm glad they are trying to do some commercial venture in this area but unfortunately it doesn't work for me...."}
{"text":"I had the French Toast along with a mimosa or two and both were delicious!
I love the patio of this place and can not wait until the weather is cooler to frequent it more often. 
The only things that i might do differently are
 1. Not have SO many things going on, it makes it a bit overwhelming. Cool concept but also confusing.

2. Fresh squeezed juices are AWESOME but take a LONG time when done to-order & there are a few drinks requiring it. I suggest to perhaps just prep some fresh squeezed juices that are ready to go for the day?

3. PBR is supposed to be cheap... it is cheap... keep it that way.

4. I too think it would HIGHLY benefit if the hours were later and had more of a bar scene... Heck I'd even stay open at 3 am a bit and experiment with late nighters who need a bite to eat after drinking."}
{"text":"Each and everytime I come here, I am happy for being able to be here and thankful that Get to have my favorite  Mac & Cheese bites. Service is a lil slow because they're legitimately busy, but plenty of social things to do and games to play for all ages."}
{"text":"Fun place with amazing drinks! Highly recommended and they also have a ton of games! Ping pong, shuffleboard, & cornhole!"}
{"text":"The Duce is an awesome place to go for day drinking, groups of friends, and celebrations, but you have to just reign in your expectations before going. 
Things to know: They are not that great with event planning. I tried twice in the past to try and have an event with them, one for my Engagement Party and two for a separate private event. Never heard from them both times, so my events never materialized.
In addition, the most recent time I went, we ordered food and they messed up our order. They DOUBLED everything we ordered. So instead of one order of mac and cheese bites, we got two. We went home with a billion mac and cheese bites because when we tried to tell them the mix up they pretty much dismissed us. 
Finally, the parking is horrible. They have valet sometimes to help with the situation but on a busy night this can be a crazy show.
Okay now that those things are on the table, the drinks are awesome, albeit a little overpriced, depending on what you order - but they are sure to get you tipsy in no time. The food is delicious! I particularly like the mashed potato parfait and the mac and cheese bites. We tried the sliders as well but they weren't as good. 
If you're in it for the 'gram, this place is totally Insta-grammable. But again as I said, just tailor your expectations before you go."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here I have had a blast! From foosball to bags to bike riding, you never really know what's gonna happen, but it is a guaranteed good time."}
{"text":"I love The Duce! I'm super bummed a place like this does not exist in SoCal. I have been here two times over the last year once for the Phoenix Lindy Exchange and more recently just to grab drinks and hang out. 

Pro's: 
It's true the drinks are expensive but yummy, fresh, and strong, totally worth it in my opinion

Lots of activities to do if you are not dancing, drinking or eating. They have a bean-bag toss, vintage board games, and retro exercise equipment to play with and explore

The music and DJ were awesome on Friday nights, no attitude and open to requests

Have valet, and plenty of street parking not dangerously far from the venue, I felt safe

Overall a great place to dance, drink and eat with friends, check it out at least once!"}
{"text":"The Duce is a great place. Excellent food, fun games and unique decor. Of course, it's owned by a former Chicagoan so I would expect nothing less. The place has atmosphere. We came here after the Cubs lost to the Dbacks and there were plenty of Cubbie fans here having a beer and playing some cornhole. Definitely coming back here. This is our kinda place!"}
{"text":"Very cool and lay low place. They have ping pong, bags, foozeball, and punching bags. Karaoke is fun to watch. The drinks are good but a little on the high end."}
{"text":"I really have a mixed feeling every time I'm at the Duce. Last night, I was here for a birthday celebration. They had a wedding and another special event so it was crowded, especially indoors. We ended sitting out in the patio area. I just wish they had more heaters turned on. Burrr, it was cold!

If you ordered food, you can't hear them calling your name on the patio. You constant have to go to the trailer to check your order. They need speakers or better notification/service. A few of us had waited a bit for the food. 

The energy and the unique vibe make this a happening place in this neighborhood. It's still a sketchy area at night. If you don't valet park, park at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time we didn't have the best experience. They were out of about half of the food we wanted to order so we had to quickly make some second choices. We had stood in line to order for 30 minutes so  just wanted to get something coming. Waited an hour for our food. Food was good not great but okay. we thought the atmosphere was very cool so tried them again this past Saturday night. Got there at 5:30, they weren't extremely busy,just a few tables going. They had three specials on the board and they all sounded yummy. Tried to order all three... they were out of TWO of them. Really? Are you serious? Okay then give us the chips with onion dip. Nope. Out of the dip too. If the Duce thinks they are being exclusive or exotic by not having half the food offered,they are missing the mark. Too many other great places to go in Phx. We won't be giving them a third try."}
{"text":"Limited parking, fortunately I was able to valet but no one else in my party was able to. The mixologist really gets into his job but is very slow and by the time you get your drink, the ice has melted in the hot sun. Definitely need to put the bar and the whole outside deal under cover. This is AZ! 
Someone in the group had ribs and did say they were very good. I had the Mac and cheese muffins. Greasy but tasteless, really. Plenty good portion. Prices are a bit high on the food and the beverages. When they call your name it is difficult to understand what they are saying. This is a great place for the 20-30 crowd. Really a disorganized after thought. It wasn't very busy; I can't imagine what they do when it is."}
{"text":"Maybe if we didn't have to wait an hour for our food and watch at least three different parties who arrived after us get their orders before us, I might give this place more stars. The food, when it finally arrived, was good but pricey. What got me is why the wait? You place your order at the front and pick up your own food. But what really got me was the girl that took our order gave us an extra drink and some popcorn but neither time did she apologies for the wait. Twice I went up to question the wait. Twice I was told ours was next. Twice it wasn't. Maybe a little more acknowledgment of the situation would have me giving the a second chance. But not after just pretending there was nothing wrong."}
{"text":"This was exactly what we needed after working at a conference. Everyone in our group was ragged and worn but this place was so upbeat and whimsical, and in no time we had a mean game of corn hole going. Next sliders, with cold beer and pie in the jar. Great for groups of all ages who want to engage in great food, hula hoops, lawn games or just people watching."}
{"text":"Great revived space, awesome hidden location right near the ballpark downtown.  Ice cream, alcohol, boxing, soda, sliders, foozeball, ping pong, the list goes on and on.  I never thought it eating in the gym would feel so hip!"}
{"text":"The Duce is located just south of Downtown Phoenix, in an old Boxing Gym that was converted into one of my favorite places in the Valley.  This is an inside/outside restaurant with plenty of activities and spots to sit to enjoy your surroundings. 

The service may be slow, but only because all the drinks are fresh made.  Citrus is squeezed just for your drink, but everyone is super friendly.

The food from the Food Trailer located on the property is too die for, and just a reminder during your summer months tip extra the food trailer as the cooks have no air and working their butt off for your appetites. The macaroni and cheese muffins are absolutely my favorite, and the 4 cheese dip is addicting.

Summer Months *** Dress for the weather"}
{"text":"It's been a long day at work, it's Friday night, and I want to chill. Then my wife reluctantly tells me that we're meeting friends tonight. I say, \"OK... I guess. What about the kid?\" No babysitter. The kids is coming along...so much for chilling out. 

We end up at The Duce. Chill is written all over and we immediately fell in love with this place. After a short stop at the vintage soda fountain (and it really works), we headed to the bar and ordered a round. Then sat down in the atruim-like area and ordered the Whole Maple Roasted Chicken (they were out of brisket, which is supposed to be really good), baked beans and a salad. The kitchen is an old Airstream and the BBQ is out back. Total bill - less than 20 bucks with a tip. The chicken was killer, so were the beans (portions could be bigger). Best part - instead of giving you a number or taking your name when your order is ready they ask for a nickname. After taking longer than normal to place our order we went with \"Indecisive\" as our nickname. Seemed to fit at the time. 

My kid was so enthusiastic about the soda fountain that we had to stop and have a malt. Apparently it was really good, because my wife and daughter finished it before I could have a taste. 

The Duce has something for just about everyone - food, drinks, candy, candle, produce, vintage bikes and heck, they even had the D-backs game on next to some old school gymnasium bleachers. The Duce is an awesome place to chillout with friends and family (very kid friendly). Certainly going back for more."}
{"text":"Awful service. Awful way to take orders. Awful parking. Don't try this place unless you enjoy waiting 20 minutes to order and 20 minutes for cheesy hush puppies."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was expecting a lot more. We went Saturday night for a 40th birthday, to get some food and drinks. It took over an hour to get the fresh corn, sliders, and two salads - but, they forgot one of the salads so that took an extra 20 minutes. It wasn't even that busy. Nonetheless, there were kids (ages 5-9) running all around, in between all the tables. The music was along the lines of middle school dance, and it was just a fairly odd group of people (adults who want to drink and a daycare center??). The food and drinks were really good, but the wait was ridiculous. The restaurant itself was very cute and the games looked fun (we'd have played, but there were literally kids on each one). I suggest setting an age limit after 5pm on weekends - it's really not a family restaurant."}
{"text":"I walked in and was just confused.  There was waaaaay to much going on.   It was like a dive bar, shake shack, farmers market, food trunk, night club with hula hops, a boxing ring, corn hole, and ping pong.  I couldn't get into it because I could focus on one thing.   It was just overwhelming."}
{"text":"We came here for a weekend brunch & had high hopes.  The parking confused most of our party & the place is huge so it took a minute to find our group. The waitstaff doesn't come to you, you go to them. Yes the drinks are fresh but crazy overpriced. The Mac and cheese muffins were super dry. The sliders were ok but not worth the price. Will not be going back because it is overpriced."}
{"text":"congrats i just saw your restauarant on craziest restaurants in America on the food network channel...,,,,i read some of the reciews and your restaurant sounds like fun and great food and company,,,see ya soon."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I really hope it becomes a staple to the downtown scene.  I suppose, in a sense, it already is.  But, as other reviewers have commented, the service this past Friday was atrocious.  We were there this past friday while the Beer and Pancake Fest (?) was going on.  I can only imagine the thousands of dollars being lost by terrible service that was going on behind the bar.  

If you guys are going to figure out how to handle a decent sized event like this, please get some pros in behind the bar!  I'll be back because I really want to support the burgeoning downtown scene.  But, I might not stay very long if the drink service doesn't get it's act together."}
{"text":"Reading the negative reviews I almost didn't check this place out. Stopped in on my way back home to California. Prior to stopping I had read if your not a regular you'd receive terrible service this was so far from the truth. Super neat place food was good, service excellent, drinks amazing loaded with a ton of ripe delicious fruit! Yes it's a little pricey but it's not your average place. I will definitely stop by again! Thank you Duce for stepping outside of the box and coming up with a super unique dining experience!m"}
{"text":"The duce seems to be everything you want it to be really. Picnic table, boxing ring, vintage items, gym, karaoke, wedding reception and a dance floor. :) 
The atmosphere was was awesome. The set up to this place was funm

I had the cheesy sliders, it was a great flavor. their roll was phenomenal. Yummmm.

I shall be backk."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a rehearsal dinner. The atmosphere was pretty awesome.  My four kids loved it. They had a ping pong table that kept them busy. They do offer healthy food choices like grass fed beef and organic eggs but as far as ingredients go, I don't know.  Their food tasted good, their staff were phenomenal and it appears pretty clean.  They did  have a broken Foosball table that may be way beyond repairable. They seem to do well enough financially to be able to buy a new one. Their prices do look a little pricey especially for the amount of food they give you and they also have a complimentary valet but I'd rather park the vehicle myself. You just can't not tip the dude!"}
{"text":"The Duce, is nothing but short of awesome. Great food, your basically in slider heaven, with drink concoctions to keep your mind stimulated and wanting more, the Duce offers a nice haven for getting away. Whether with a group of friend or just a few drinks with a friend, the Duce has even a quite good collection of pf flyers and vintage shirts to keep any hipster at bay. It's definitely worth checking and super approved by us here at cafehunters."}
{"text":"The Duce - a boxing ring, etc.!

Knock-out:
- s'mores cheesecake \"for four\" \"people\" blowtorched to order.
- bacon mac 'n' cheese muffins because don't be a sociopath just get them.
- the chicken pot pie that will accompany Marie Callender's resignation letter.
- ping pong, hula hooping, karaoke, vintage kitchen, bleachers, memorabilia, nostalgia.  

Other boxing term for decent:
- banana cream pie milkshake brings a few boys to the yard.
- noodle kugel, served cold and fruity for instant \"Shabbat moment\" flavor.
- breakfast and meatball slider rated edible by 9/10 gastroenterologists.
- tons of seating only it's hot AF and everyone wants to be at the 4 cool tables.

Third boxing term for not preferable:
- chicken sausage reminiscent of wet cat food in a tube.
- corn hole.

I don't know sh*t about boxing. Not all the food is awesome, but pretty much everything else is, and the festivities are free. Also, all the food was made in a trailer so stop whining. Now get up in the ring and lemme hear ya sing \"ROXXXXAAAAANE.\""}
{"text":"Stopping in here while I was on a Sunday morning Downtown bike ride,  I wasn't prepared [with cash or cards] as I wasn't expecting to stop anywhere.  I parked my bike and walked in.  Roaming through their retail area I was surprised to see that there were alteast 8-10 cars outside and several people inside.  The clothes....hummm I will reserve my opinion.  Glanced over at the bar and a seperate soda fountain.  I finally made my way to the patio to check out the airstream kitchen.  Cool!....I had heard they had a statue of the Hams Bear in here somewhere too....did I miss it...Bummer!

I will have to check out the food some other time maybe on my next ride that way...as I wouldn't feel too cozy walking solo that way even in the light of day...It's pretty dead downtown on a Sunday but there was still someone lurking around just about every corner."}
{"text":"Last night a group of us went to The Duce in downtown Phoenix. It. Was. Fantastic. An old 1928 brick warehouse, the space is all indoor/outdoor, the food is roach coach style, the speciality \"vintage cocktails\" are served in mason jars and the overall vibe is uber hip & comfortable. We bought some vintage Love Button jewelery, ate Chicago style hot dogs, meatball sliders and waffles while mingling with a magician and singing along to 60's tunes. What more could you ask for? Oh, bottomless fresh squeezed grapefruit mimosas for a dog friendly Sunday brunch? Sign me up. One of the coolest spots in Phoenix for sure. The service was a little slow but that didn't bother me as everyone was super nice and quite frankly - I wasn't in a hurry and didn't mind waiting for a drink. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Like the idea- cool spot. It was hot when we got there but I would enjoy returning after sunset. Loved my whiskey sour- pricy but good. Skip the food- had the chips & onion dip, 3 slider combo & chicken brat- eh wasn't impressed with any of the food to be honest. Skip the food come for a cocktail, maybe a shot or two! Nice atmosphere! Loved the cashier- blonde, skinny gal with tattoos- she was new & so nice!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated. A really comfortable place to get a beer and some dinner. We ordered their chicken pot pie, grass fed beef sliders, a Chicago dog (legit neon relish on that) and Mac n cheese muffins. All of which were really great! But that chicken pot pie was our favorite. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll most definitely make my way out there."}
{"text":"I had so much fun with my friends here. The music they play is awesome. Drinks are a bit over priced for the amount of Ice the bartenders add. But I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Neat!! This place has the most random set up as you will find in other reviews. Menu is all organic, our bar tender/ server was very entertaining. The location was a bit hole in the wall, but once inside very worth it!"}
{"text":"The Duce is great during our beautiful spring weather!!  Loved listening to the Rolling Stones AND The Bee Gees while drinking my delightfully fun Sunday Rose'"}
{"text":"Took my brother and sister-in-law here to see the live music and enjoy the finally cooler weather central phx has to offer...we had a good time.  I heard there was karaoke here though, and i guess we came on the wrong night, we would of really loved to see some ppl go crazy on the stage--which is a boxing ring!  

We had Whiskey Sours, that were served with fruit and mint on the rim in mason jars--really good!  The potato crisps were not that great---and really expensive.  

Overall, the place wasn't too crowded and we were able to enjoy the music without ppl stepping on our toes and decent seating. 

Oh, and i love how they have Valet parking---didn't have to worry about finding a parking on the street in case the very tiny parking lot was full."}
{"text":"I don't care how good your food truck cuisine supposedly is, when there are a dozen people standing around \"working\" and none of them can take your order, there is a problem. I don't care how \"trendy\" your establishment is, bad service is just that. Indifferent employees, potholes in the parking lot the size of swimming pools, and an empty water dispenser were only a few of the items that have ensured I will not come back here."}
{"text":"We went there last July or so, this place gets one star because this place HAS NO AC.
No AC in Phoenix.  Lol it was 192 degrees in there at night. No thank you."}
{"text":"We had our Best Western corporate mixer here what a great spot food was good and we had a lot of fun very cool retro place."}
{"text":"This is a really chill spot. Came here after work and had a awesome experience. Environment was really laid back they have a boxing ring ping pong table dance lessons it was all of the above.. lots of room for a big group. Customer service was great food was really good for bar food scene. Overall I would def put this on my list to come back to when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks but that's about it. Waiters, bartenders and even managers are not only incompetent but quite rude also. 

Yesterday I set up a poetry set to showcase a few local Phoenix artist. I had told the management on multiple occasions what we where going to be doing and the nature of our show. We had the spot reserved for over a month and a half! Not only where they not ready (understaffed and one of their bars closed) but once our audience started showing up (most of color), all of a sudden there was a problem with our show. 

What makes the whole situation worse is that the place was DEAD, maybe 10 people at most. My group had about 50 people with another 40 expected to show up. All ordering drinks and food. But the owner Steve still decided to kick us out because we where going to \"offend\" his clientele. The same clients that were coming up to me and my group wanting to take pictures with us, some even asking to buy tickets to the event. The shirts that Steve claimed to be offensive to his clients where all BOUGHT from us by his clients at the place. Some even going as far as buying the shirts off our back Literally! 

As a successful Real Estate Investor it is obvious to me that this place does not know how to run a business. And further more this place is willing to give up a very profitable night turning away close to 100 customers willing to consume food and drinks, just because we look different than their normal audience."}
{"text":"I don't care what other people say or write. I haven't read a thing anybody has said before starting this.

As long as the season allows it, bring all your out of town family here. This is as original destination. The ambiance is unlike anything you have ever been too for a dinning experience. Not sure I would bring kids too young here.

Food is simple; sliders and macaroni muffins are all you need to order with your choice of an adult beverage. 

Come in, take a seat, then find the trailer to place your order. You and your guests will absolutely love."}
{"text":"Love how the drinks are made as everything is fresh and they are amazing... wish the bartenders were more friendly. I always order the brisket sliders as they are delicious! It's more of a hipster crowd lacking more of a diverse crowd... still a good time! Music isn't great but again it's a hipster crowd so more main stream music."}
{"text":"This place was great! The atmosphere was not \"clubby\" which is great! The karaoke was also wonderful.  I would defintely come back again to dance the night away."}
{"text":"Booo! Arrived at 5:30, ordered food at 5:45 as it took 10 minutes to get drinks..and it's now 7p with no food. One person in our party got a refund, the rest of us are headed in the same direction. They have a wedding going on on one side and a bar Mitzvah on the other and the rest of us are just sort of in the middle looking for a spot to sit. We have music and announcements coming from both sides which is distracting. Just too much happening at one time so maybe one event at a time? Anyway, the place is packed so you would think they'd have more staff but not the case. The ordering process needs serious improvement as you just stand in front of a small station for food or another one for drinks. Maybe it wouldn't  be an issue if there weren't so many people and there was room for a line. Not the case so people are sort or piled in and the girl taking the orders doesn't know who supposed to be next. What a cluster f*#*! While the drinks are great, again, the ordering process needs improvement. So some food arrived before all was canceled. Sliders pretty good as was the cheese dip. Guess we'll have to try this place again....and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Seems like a great place to be I absolutely love it the atmosphere and the people I saw a father dancin to Beyonce with his beautiful two young daughters it was great vibes I have to come back, earlier we came close to ending time ugh love it here I don't wanna go home


So I stayed till they closed and I'll tell u i had  5 drinks the margarita was so bomb great do if try whatever u like then the mark you'll love it"}
{"text":"I went to the Duce this weekend for the first time and can not believe I have not gone before! This place is so much fun. They have a boxing ring, hula hoops, exercise equipment, shuffle board, corn hole, a fun and lively dance floor and ping pong. They serve beer like Old Milwaukee....so, in other words, the BF's dream bar. But he was not there, I went with Erin B. for her bachelorette party. The drinks were very expensive, but they were fresh, tasty, and packed an alcoholic punch. My philosophy is that if I am going to pay upwards of 10$ for a drink, it better be all made in house with fresh fruit and this was, so I can't complain. A few of us went up and did a few exercises on the wall where you hold up your body and lift your knees to your chest, I did 3 and was very proud of myself....then a couple girls came over and really showed us up...they were aerial pole dances and were hanging upside down by one arm and whatnot....very fun to watch. I think the best part of this bar is that it can be whatever you want it to be....it can be quiet and laid back in some areas, full of games and entertainment in some areas and a dance club in others. I will definitely be back to this bar again.


PS funny story....I had already had a good amount of alcohol upon arrival. We were all standing by the trailer waiting to order beers. I saw that there was a satellite dish on the wall and thought 'wow..that's an odd thing to use as kitch...' I continued staring at the ceiling like an idiot when a plane flew overhead and I realized we were still outside...obviously it was a good night."}
{"text":"I visit Phoenix fairly often.  We decided to check out this place at the recommendation of a friend on a Friday night at around 6pm. First thing we noticed was the whole walking directly into a storefront thing. Okay cool, but no one around to guide newbies. It looked like an event was being set up next to the store section. Great music drew us into a fairly open and empty room with amps and great 80's music. We did not see anywhere to order apps or drinks, so we walked to the outside, where it seemed the majority of the patrons were. One member of our party went to the circular bar in the center to get 3 drinks. It took over 20 minutes for him to return. Another member of our party went to the food ordering stand thing. Again, over 20 minutes for bacon mac muffins and cheese dip.  Our first 3 drinks came to over $40 without food added on. I went to get another round for our group, spent another 20+ minutes being ignored by the bartender, until finally he turned to me and asked if I was with the wedding party. I had no idea there was a wedding party. No signage, nobody giving out that information. I replied no, and was told that there was another bar inside of the building that would give me better service - all after sitting for 20+ minutes, watching him drop his juice squeezer on the floor and pick it up without washing it, and being pretty disappointed by how other people's orders were being taken before mine when I had been standing there much longer. My party had gotten their appetizers while I was gone waiting for this guy. I had a cold muffin and a few scoops of cold cheese dip, then, with one muffin left in the basket, an employee picked up the basket - sticking his thumb in the muffin - and asked if we were finished as he did not even wait for a response and turned away with it. You can bet I won't be going here again. Too bad the music was good."}
{"text":"This place has been on DDD a couple of times and friends have recommended it several times. I have now tried them twice and must say, I am not impressed. Both times I visited they were not busy and waited over 45 min each time for lunch. REALLY, not a place for lunch, if you have to go back to work. Food was decent but nothing to write home about. Service is cold and tries too hard to be cool and laid-back, just comes off as unconcerned and indifferent. Maybe next time I will arrive with Guy Fieri, then I can get service and food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place!! It has such a unique and fun vibe! The decor is so eclectic, it just screams \"Let's have fun!!\" This would definitely be a fun place to hang with friends or have a party, it's a great place to be a kid again! 
However... there were some disappointments. We sat outside to enjoy the weather, but were completely inundated with flies. We couldn't keep them off us or the food and we had to move inside. Additionally, the outside courtyard really smelled badly of sewer or trash, I honestly couldn't decipher. Not appetizing at all. 
My husband had the pot pie which was super yummy! Great flavor and unique with the sweet corn! 
The Mac and cheese muffins would have been good, but they were cold... 
I ordered their thanksgiving special and the description clearly said, \"turkey, stuffing and gravy with a side of cranberry\" perfect! Except the cranberries were All inside the stuffing inside the sand which. Which is fine, if you like cranberries. The sand which probably would be super yummy for those who enjoy that. I understand this is my personal preference, my frustration was their signage was completely wrong. I would have ordered something else. 
Finally the desserts weren't bad, but just ok! Just milkshakes, nothing to write home about! Kind of a bummer for the price."}
{"text":"One of the cutest places I've ever seen. Stumbled on to it after a Diamondbacks game. Tuesday night is swing dancing. 

Friendly staff. Great cocktails. Great concept. Wish they had a place like this back home. 

Thanks for making depressed Giants fans welcomed"}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Duce!  I used to drive up Central and see the sign, not knowing if it was a restaurant, bar, gym, or store.  The fact is that it is all of the above.  Upon entering The Duce has such an unexpected element as you walk in.  When you walk through the old warehouse you stumble upon one surprise after another.  Looking for the most satisfying Mac and cheese?  You'll find it here!  Boxing and yoga on a Sunday morning?  Yup, it's here.  If my description of The Duce has you intrigued or even confused, pay them a visit!  You will not be disappointed.  Make sure to check out their hours of operation.  Monday's they are closed, but they make up for it with being open late every other day!"}
{"text":"This place was very lame. Crowd was dry  and the staff were aggressive for no reason. Just trying to have fun and chill, wouldn't recommend to a anyone. I was with 4 others. And they agree. Wasn't welcoming at all."}
{"text":"I had heard such great reviews from others about this place and was excited to try it.  So excited that I invited other friends to meet up there before heading over to a concert nearby.  I checked to make sure it was wheelchair accessible for a friend who was joining us for dinner and the website said, \"yes\" only to find out when we got there that there was NO handicapped parking available nor was there enough room for her to unload herself in her chair.  Not cool, we left immediately."}
{"text":"Fantastic area to eat and play in. The environment is amazing and the food is equally amazing. I would say the environment reminds me of the fallout games in a nostalgic and fun way. The best thing to order there is the macaroni and cheese muffins. They are my main reason for visiting this place, but the friendly staff and environment make for the perfect atmosphere with their amazing drinks and of course the Marconi and cheese muffins. YUM"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My favorite thing to eat here are the mac and cheese muffins!  

Such a cute area for a happy hour or dinner with the family.  Outdoor patio seating, yet it is all covered with trees and coverage.

There is a cute shop inside and a boxing ring, along with an area to play ping pong, foosball, and cornhole.

Fun place for kids and adults!


Also, I have been here for a wedding.  Super cute!!!"}
{"text":"Will not return. Rude employees from the start. I would have left but we already did valet and were meeting friends. The ordering system is not ideal nor the food pick up. Non alcoholic drinks are pricey and there are no refills. Served in small Mason jars. The whole set up was confusing and its hot and humid inside. 
Food was okay but overpriced. 
Tried the Mac & cheese deals and they were awesome - that's where the extra star on my review came from."}
{"text":"Had the sliders tonight- bread was too hard.  DIfficult to eat. With a softer bread, would have been tasty.   Friend had Mac/Cheese muffins.  Pretty tasteless.  Great concept, but not very good.  Will stick with salads if we have to go again with friends or something

  Understaffed tonight- wait for food was 30-40 minutes, Wait at bar was over ten minutes.... and it was hot inside and it's only MARCH.

  Wouldn't go back unless i had a reason to- special event planned there or something."}
{"text":"Super Hipster, and awesome healthy yummy eats. great fresh drinks, and a total casual place to be.... only downside, no A/C... so it's super hot, when it's super hot outside, because it's basically outside and inside a warehouse. loved the place though, had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is so so unique! All drinks are served in large mason jars and made with FRESH fruit. There's tons of options and the food is good too!"}
{"text":"Ok..... where do I begin.... the Duce is by FAR my favorite date night place of all time!!! The atmosphere is incredible, the options of activities is endless, the drinks are AH-MAAAAAAZZZZIIINNNNGGGGG, and the DJ's always know how to get everyone on the floor. My boyfriend and I come here Fridays after 9 (which is only 21 and over) to have a couple drinks and to play fooseball, ping pong, bean bag toss, get our grove on (did I mention there was tons to do?) and we always leave talking about how much fun we had for the next week straight! My boyfriend also discovered here he is a professional hula hooper and won a free drink for his newly discovered talent. The owners are so so nice and interacted with Matt and I the whole night- we even had a ping pong challenge which if I would have won... would have scored myself a free drink.... #soreloser... anyways if you are looking for a fun date night- a fun girls night out- a place to discover your next hidden talent- a place to have the most fantastic drink of your life- a place to have a blast- or a place that will put the kid back in the grown up you who has worked all week and needs to let loose.... go visit the Duce"}
{"text":"This place does a really good job at offering Phoenix something it doesn't have.  It brings dancing, hoola hooping, boxing, ping pong-ing?, corn holing, and drinking all into one spot.

  There are probably a couple of places like that, but not many.  With the music they play, and the different scene they offer, this place is one of its own.  I am happy to come here and smiling when I leave.  

The prices are a bit much, you can drop plenty of money if you are buying at a whim.  The drinks and cocktails are ok, I didn't really click with any but the experience I had was unique."}
{"text":"My favorite place of all time. The Duce serves great hand crafted vintage cocktails and has so many fun things to do - cornhole, shuffle board, dance floor, etc! This place is always chill and never too crowded with fun friendly customers and staff! Nestled right downtown with a few nice skyline views! The Duce is the way to go if you are into something a little different and less snooty than Scottsdale bars."}
{"text":"The Duce is probably the coolest bar/restaurant/smoothie shop/boxing ring/clothing store/trailer you'll ever go to!

In the mood for mind-bowing short rib sliders? Check.

Need a new pair of Chuck's? Check.

Thirsty for an ice-cold PBR? Check.

Feel like punching someone in the face? Check-ish...

My only gripe would be drink prices. If you're down to slam some PBR or old school Budweiser, the you're drinking for $3 a pop. Fancy a Mojito - that'll run you about $12 for a 6oz-er. Focus on the cheap drinks and the amazing food, and you will love this place forever!"}
{"text":"Must update my review- the owner of this place is a d-bag! They were so concerned with their lame karaoke night that they wouldn't let us sing any songs that involved \"bad words\". Also 90% of the people there weren't even drinking- which isn't a big deal except for the fact that my friends and I's $50 bar tab a piece (for like 4 mediocre drinks) didn't warrant more leniency for karaoke. It's not like we were trying to sing Wu-Tang. But seriously every 10 minutes the owner or manager was running over like a total prude yelling at the dj. Lame lame lame. Will never come here again. This place is like a church retreat- but even worse. Also- their clothes and boutique totally suck. And they're bathrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"This is a awesome little funky spot!

It seems to house a bar/restaurant, a boxing club and some other space that was having some kind of yoga thing the morning we went.

The food and service were both outstanding. I ordered a skillet scramble with mushrooms, bacon and gruyere. My gf ordered the cinnamon pecan french toast with bacon.

This place is great, try it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"I love the inside decor and atmosphere.  The food was to salty for my liking, but they did have free valet."}
{"text":"I came to the Duce again this past weekend.  Based on my last visit, I didn't really want to eat here again, but a friend was having his going away here and I was starving so I ordered dinner.  I got the chicken pot pie in a jar and the sweet potato crisps.

The pot pie was good, although pretty small.  I liked the flakiness of the crust, but at the end of the meal the glass jar it came in broke!  The bottom corner of it came clean off.  I think the glass might have been weakened from being baked.  Not sure if the jar it came in was made to withstand high heat like that....

The sweet potato crisps were a pretty big let down.  I thought they would be more like savory fries, but they are actually like potato chips.  And burnt chips at that!  Also, they were covered in brown sugar.  I would've preferred for them to be savory.  I expected them to be savory bc the lady who took my order asked if I wanted a french onion dip with them?  Sweet chips with a french onion dip sounds like an awful combination.  I'm glad I turned down the dip.

Oh and eating all that hot food in a warehouse with no A/C was no bueno.  I was sweating and trying to fan myself, but it didn't help!  They need more fans or maybe some kind of indoor mister system...

So yeah, I should have listened to the advice from my previous review and just stuck to drinks and the games here!  Everything else is only okay."}
{"text":"I'd been here once before but this time it was even BETTER!  Drinks are great...I had the raspberry gimlet. Food is amazing. Mac and cheese muffins were to die for and the slider sampler was very flavorful.  Along with the games and good music (although it was a bit loud for conversation) I would recommend this place for any group gathering."}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this restaurant to us and told us not to be fooled by the outside. We pulled up and thought what the heck is this place? It does NOT look like your typical eatery. We walked into a courtyard with tables and a \"Duchess\" 1968 streamline camper that serves as the kitchen. Then we walked into the warehouse area and we were greeted by a boxing ring, hula hoops, bean bag toss and a couple of ping pong tables. Oh and they have an old soda fountain area. So unique and eclectic! You won't want to miss the diamond in the rough in downtown Phoenix, AZ. 
Not only was the vibe super cool and fun but the food totally rocked my taste buds! Diners, Drive ins and Dives even had a show at this place. 
 2 thumbs up from me and my hubby!"}
{"text":"this may be my favorite bar in all the Tempe/Phoenix/Scottsdale area.

1. live band karaoke. they have a limited list and it's higher register / challenging stuff but not so much that we novice karaokeers can't hang. regular karaoke is fun too and much bigger selection but get there EARLY because the list can be shut down as early as 9/9:30.

2. have your cupid shuffle, wobble, electric slide, boot scoot boggies and thrillers down. you will use them. trust me. and everyone here knows them.

3. hula hoops are WAY harder than you remember them being at age 9. so practice and try to be the last man/woman standing.

4. the huge jar drinks are fantastic. sugary for the most part, but fantastic. I love the 1.5 liter white russian personally.

5. come ready to dance like nobody is watching."}
{"text":"Didn't get what the Duce was doing AT ALL - almost seems like they found cheap warehouse space and decided they HAD to use ALL the space.  Then they used ideas 11-20 as well as their top 10 just to not hurt someone's feelings. Boxing ring? OK! Gift shop? Sure! Lawn games? Yup. Put a trailer inside? Fine. And a fancy bar? Yes. But with just 1 small TV? How quaint! After we get all that, can Pinterest throw up all over everything?

We had to talk to 4 people to understand where the food was and how to order it, then another person to order drinks. The food was the solitary high point - brisket sliders and mac n cheese muffins - quite good. Drinks were a bummer - the bartender put alot of show into the mixology - muddling stuff, scooping, shaking, pouring - took his time. My drink still came out watered down, impossible to stir because of the awkward, squat mason jar packed with ice, and there was barely anyone there to boot.

Just start with one thing done well, Duce - I've heard if there are fights, it's alot of fun, but seeing how poorly organized it was for just the 20ish people that were there, don't know if I'll trust them to manage a crowd well"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'll be the one. The idea is fun I suppose. But even a good dive should have at least something going for it. So not the people, not the service, definitely not the music-they have a lot of seating? Yeah because there was absolutley no one there on a Friday night. Stay weird Duce people. No thanks."}
{"text":"I am so mad that I spent $40 here for horrible food and a stomach ache. I had the breakfast sliders. Eggs were burnt and the sausage and biscuit has no flavor. My husband had the trio of sliders and said they were not good. You really don't have a server. You go up to the bar and order. No one checked on us to see if were enjoying our food. The \"cheap\" beers were $4. This is $4 for a PBR, Hamms or Old Style. I had a Moscow Mule which was flavorless and $10. I should have complained, but I just wanted to get the h*ll out of there. Will never return."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint, from the eclectic vibe to the mac and cheese muffins, amazing! I had the sliders, one brisket and one chicken, both were really good and was the right amount of food.  Music was also eclectic mix, very upbeat, for lunch crowd."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Great environment! The mashed potatoes in a cup is my favorite! They also have to die for sliders. And great cocktails!"}
{"text":"Had such a blast here! Karaoke on Fridays and Saturdays with a dj and dance music. Food and drinks til 1am and such a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I drove 3 hours to give it a try, and see if it would work for a wedding rehearsal party but found it overpriced, and the kitchen clearly unable to keep up with the flow of customers.  First the environment: BUSY. So much going on. Retro and unique.  Fun.  I can imagine the \"stepping back in time\" feel is part of the charm.  Games here, tables there but unfortunately everything appeared to be reserved so seating was hard to find.  We were there in late June, on a Saturday night, and it was hot inside.   Uncomfortably hot.  
The service: we arrived around 7pm. There were only two couples ahead of us at the food truck.  We ordered off the menu, but had to wait 15 minutes for the lemonade.   Did I mention it's hot?   We didn't see water anywhere and no offer of a glass of water.  To be clear, you order your food and pick it up. No one brings it to you.  So, we were told it would take about 35 minutes for our name to be called to pick our food.  About 35 minutes later we were called but that was to tell us that the kitchen ran out of one of our items so we needed to order something else.  20 minutes later still nothing.  So once again went to the food truck to see what the problem was.  The kitchen apologized to us and gave us 1/2 our order and told us the other half would be ready in 5-10 minutes.   I waited again and then walked back after 10+ minutes.   The server at the food truck window apologized again and got the rest of our food together.  Most of our food  was lukewarm at best.  The ribs were ok, the chicken sausage Rueben was awful, the chili cornbread jar was hot and okay, the roasted bacon bruschetta had no bacon on it that we could detect.   For the price paid the food was very basic- nothing spectacular.  Yes we could have walked it all back to the food truck to have it reheated, etc...but then it would have taken even longer.  When we left, no one asked if everything was ok or said goodbye. This place appears to be understaffed.  
I wanted to like this place.  Heard so much about it, but ended up being disappointed.  Wish I had the experience that all the other people on this post had.  Maybe we just visited on a bad day."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Atmosphere, food, extras, Love it!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday hundred 15 degrees outside 4 in the afternoon environment is so pleasant definitely a fun place to have groups or families with adult kids. However the service and fortunately was below standard we were there for a good 30 minutes without even being offered something to drink once you realize you had to wait in the line to order our food the cashier was with the same customer for a good 15 minutes mind you it's 115 degrees outside! Young lady knew it was our first time here she saw sitting at the table and did not give us Direction on how to proceed with ordering a drink and food we left without even drinking water unfortunately we will not be returning but good luck to the next"}
{"text":"Oh man, I hate this star rating thing! Food and service are two completely different features of a restaurant. So I'll do the average and give the Duce a 3. It doesn't sit well with me but it is what it is. Starting with their food- delicious, savory, never disappoints. Tried majority of their menu.... most sliders, Mac & cheese bites, etc... all delicioso! Now moving on to service. At the bar, expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes before being acknowledged. After that, expect another 10 minutes for your actual drink to arrive. I've been here at least 10 times and this has been the case each and every time. Doesn't matter if the bar is slow or hectic, expect a wait. If you're pressed for time or want a quick drink, this is NOT the place for you. Couple of reasons. 1.) There is only 1 person tending bar. 2.) All cocktails are made to order, as in fresh squeezed juices, freshly chopped garnishes, etc... 
So what you end up with is almost always a delicious and perfectly fresh drink. BUT I feel that their prices are a bit absurd. For example, here now and I ordered a spicy Bloody Mary. $13.03. That's just silly. Phoenix is full of craft cocktail joints & mixologists. The reason we don't come here as much as we'd like is for this reason. We can throw a few down and don't want to pay $13 per drink while doing so. Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"The duce has been on my list of must-try's for months now! I was so glad I finally checked it out, but also glad I waited until the weather cooled off a bit! 

This is a throwback, retro, hip...kind of spot. It can be kind of confusing if you're not with someone who has been at least once before. I walked into the part of the building where you can buy clothes/accessories. There are tables and some kind of smoothie spot to your left and a boxing ring in the back. See what I mean by confusing? Aside from not knowing where to go, it is in a very conspicuous spot so it could be easy to pass and somewhat of a challenge for parking.

We poked our heads around the corner and it looked to be just a hang out and someone was celebrating a birthday. Finally I asked the girl behind the cash register where we could order food.  She explained a bit about the place and showed us around. I appreciated that and further confirmed my confusion statement assuming others had felt the same way before. ;) 

The patio is GREAT! Mismatched retro chairs, wooden picnic tables, hanging records and who could forget the silver trailer they serve food from?!  It took a minute to find the menu because she pointed around to random things and said, \"menu is written all over the place\" and that was it. Well, she was right...it's written on old tattered doors and wooden fence. Finally we went and asked for a real one..much better.

We got the meatball sliders and strawberry pecan salad. Both were DELICIOUS! Drinks were served in a glass coke bottle and what other than a mason jar. Cute. 

Now being somewhat familiar with the way things work I look forward to returning. Combination of good food, good weather and great atmosphere I can't wait to take someone who's never been. This is definitely an experience.(:"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to The Duce and just about as enjoyable as the previous two. I love the vibe here - great cocktails, good music, and comfort food. Next time I'm going for the beer-can chicken and forcing myself to wait the 25 minutes. It looks amazing! We had the sliders, roasted corn, and special of the day - Sonoran Hot Dog. All were delicious. Their cocktails are amazing though and I cannot get that fresh margarita (no mixer) out of my head. Going back for another sometime soon for sure. The only down side to this visit was the music from the wedding in the back half of the building. I love how they divided the place off for the wedding, and the sheer panels looked beautiful blowing in the breeze. But the music... Two sides of The Duce playing competing tunes was confusing. If there's a wedding and they have great music and a DJ - let it flow outward. Otherwise... it's just too much."}
{"text":"What a joke. Went there for \"happy hour\" on Friday and paid $16.00 for a 16oz drink that was 90% ice.  No AC and no waitresses. No!! I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Fun, Unique, Urban ambiance & a little bit of Average Joe's gym with amazing food. Pancakes to die for! Thank god for all the work out equipment, ping pong, corn hole ... Kept us busy while we waited for an hour for our food (and it wasn't even packed...) would definitely come back... But only if I had a couple hours to spear. Food = 5, service =1"}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night for karaoke. The dj flat out told us that he doesn't care and he just wanted to play music all night. We talked to the manager, and his response was that the dj was just being a jerk and walked away. Then, the dj did a karaoke song himself! It was way too loud to even talk. The small drinks were $11. Not a good experience, and definitely not a place to go for karaoke."}
{"text":"This is a long one but I think you will get some good info....I hope. 

I had a blast at the Duce on Saturday night. However I don't think the Duce had anything to do with it. I was there to see super happy fun time burlesque show. It was amazing! The only reason the Duce received 3 stars instead of 2 is because they allowed this show to go on. 

Lets start from the beginning. 

Parking - Free valet - Awe-some! I had read past reviews that said parking was an issue. I am not sure if the free valet is for show nights only or if it's just a fix based on past reviews. Either way it's good work!

Entering the Duce- It is pretty cool to walk into the outside. You really can not tell you are still outside unless you look up. The decor is old school and I love it. 

You order your food in the first leg of the Duce race. It's a little streamline trailer that cooks the food. When we arrived we stood in quite a line. Everyone coming in or leaving were bumping into you in line because the douchy scottsdale people decided they would stand and fist bump each other right in the middle of the isle way. I really felt like I was in Scottsdale for a minute. I mean they had tons of seating in that area that wasn't in the direct path of EVERYONE. I guess they wouldn't have been noticed as much though. Uhhh this is why I stick to Phoenix. They shouldn't be allowed in our hood! ;)

Food - We ordered our food and it suuuuuucked. We got the brisket sliders and the sweet potato chips. They put brown sugar on the sweet potato chips! They need salt to balance them....not more sugar. The sliders had a sauce that was not pleasant at all...even my partner in crime did not like them and he eats anything. 

* read below about the horrible employee who takes your food order. 

Saving Grace- Pudding Cake with banana, walnuts and whipped cream on top. Oh my .... it was one of the best deserts I have ever had. It wasn't too sweet but just the right yum a yum yum. That same partner in crime is not a fan of sweets but he helped me with it. I was bummed because I wanted to try the baked apple pancake but they said they didn't have it. So I got the pudding cake and I am happy I did. 

Next you enter the bar area. It's your typical bar area with an old B of a bartender. Thank goodness I got the nice guy. I was able to order my drinks really quick even though the place was pretty crowded. I decided to try something different and went with a Moscow Mule. It was really good! They do not skimp on the alcohol which is fantastic for all involved. 

They are all made in super cute mason jars and garnished to eye catching perfection. They also use a lot of fresh fruit etc. Awesome! One of the best I have experienced. 

Then you move into the boxing ring/ store area. They have vintage military items and old girly trinkets. It's very cool. They didn't have any of the lights on to buy anything which I thought was crazy. I would have spent a ton but oh well. 

Then the show went on in the boxing ring. The show was awesome!

Later on in the night I wanted a strawberry lemonade so I went to where we ordered our food because that is where you get the fresh lemonade. 

The same two people were there and one had 5 people she was helping at her little mixed drink bar and the other was just standing by the lemonade. So I asked her can I get a drink from you? She said in a nasty tone \"not a mixed drink\". I said how about a strawberry lemonade? She said NOPE you need to get it from her. I was thinking how weird that was because she was standing by the lemonade and just needed to grab 2 strawberries. But I guess I was interrupting her doing nothing. 

So I slid back over to the line and the nice lady put 2 strawberries in my cup and that stupid younger girl with the blackish/reddish bob brought over a glass of lemonade! WTF?!? The only reason she did that is because the bartender supervisor/manager guy had come over to check on things. I was so pissed. Lazy! Avoid Her!!!

Oh, and I am dying to know why the owner was interrupting the leader of the group at the end of the show. He looked mad so it was either he was mad it ran a bit over or it was too much. I think he was mad it ran late. I mean who wants to make a ton of money and only have to stay open until 12:00am?

So to sum it all up - Service terrible
Food- Terrible
Environment - Good 
Parking - Good"}
{"text":"Happy New Year indeed! Or should I say in DUCE! Doctor and absolutely delicious meal at 'The Breadfruit' nearby, I was anxious to see the inside of this place. You see I initially found out about it thanks for perusing meetup.com... In usual rebel form after finding out that there was no cover charge, food options, and would look like a big open space full of wonder I was intrigued to visit the venue without going through the motions being approved to hang out with a group of strangers first. Sure enough right at half past eleven my beau and I traipse in, half asleep to discover some amazing 90 days party music, lots if games, a shop and even a massive gym fully equipped with a boxing ring smack dab in the middle of the place! I quickly got my second wind, found a lovely place to post up and start dancing and enjoy the black and blue mojito twice. Before I knew it we were counting down to midnight and then made our way over to enjoy a game of foosball, cornhole and some ping pong! Needless to say it was a great fun yet relaxed way to bring in the New Year. I'm looking forward to seeing what future events may happen here."}
{"text":"The Duce hosted the @instagramaz World Wide Instameet. It was my first time here, it was such an aesthetically beautiful place. Very unique. Great service and inside and outside seating. Some shopping too. Loved everything about this bar/lounge. They serve food too,  but didn't order anything. Definitely a must place to go if you go downtown. @theduce #theduce #yelp"}
{"text":"This is yet another urban indoor/outdoor market place that is becoming very popular in the Valley.  Think of the food court at the mall.  Independent counters to order services/food from.  Then think of a circus.  Then think of the arcade  Then think of a bar.  Ok, got all those things in mind?  cool, you've got the picture.

Things I like:
1.  My sliders were great.  The Mac and Cheese muffings were just OK for me.
2. The craziness of it all.  its like walking through the mall food court.  You might see any kind of activiy on display (i.e. Mall fashion show, Mall concert, Mall boxing ring.)
3. Those drinks:  they are winners!
4. do they have concerts here?  Geez Louise!  I'd love to attend one there.

Things I'd like to see changed:
1. Nothing.

I loved this place.  so unique and so cool."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit The Duce for a real long time. Family visited and we meant to stop in for a drink, wound up staying the whole night!  Great vibe to the whole place, the staff is efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. Great concept of local produce used in their delicious beverages and entrees.  
Being in the fitness industry myself I can appreciate the work outs they put on as well. 
I take every visitor I have to this place!  Try the mojito!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about my experience at the duce. I took my mother, sister and girlfriend there on a Tuesday night and had a fun time overall. The positives are that the food is good, the building was large, and they had a unique list of beers: old style, schlitzz, and other Chicago-only beers.

Unfortunately, the waitress that took our order was very rude, the bartenders were blatantly talking about how to get more tips out of their customers,  and the macaroni and cheese muffins were not as good as Guy Fieri made them out to be. 

I would not recommend this place because of the service, the limited parking, and the uncomfortable seating. I could not see myself coming back unless they improved their menu, and worked on their customer service."}
{"text":"Everyone was awesome, except the bus boy. Over and over I and my friends hate how the bus boy prematurely clears unfinished expensive beverages from table when we're playing games even though our belonging are still on table and other people are chatting near the table. You literally have to guard your drinks with your life. Food was 'eh.'"}
{"text":"A sure most try, The Duce is a very hipster family fun place were you can also enjoy a throw back beer and listen to awesome funky music and is perfect if you have younger ones in the group that hold you back from a regular bar/club I have seen children on a Friday night with family. Not a very big selection on drinks and I would not recommend the food, mostly a fun place to hang out after dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly an amazing place! I had seen it on diners drive ins and dives and i had a road trip to arizona so it was perfect! Yes it has a lot going on but it's so different from anything I've seen. It's something you can go enjoy with your family (day time) and something u can enjoy with friends/significant other at night. Hula hoop, boxing, ping-pong. And AMAZING food! That mac n cheese muffins r really good and the chicken pot pie! Yum! And the egg sausage and bacon sliders to die for!! It takes a while to receive food but I mean there's a lot going on so it will go by fast. Oh and think of a nickname because they will call u to pick up food by that name (;  and the drinks are really good too! Everything so fresh! Overall an amazing experience."}
