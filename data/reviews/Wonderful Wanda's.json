{"text":"Wonderful service and food. The waitress brought a huge pitcher of coffee over for us. Love that. Also my husband loved his spinach and bacon omelette. He substituted for egg whites and added avocado. Amazing."}
{"text":"I debated giving this a 2 for the price - it's very OP, but I saw this week you can get coupons in the val pack. It's a cute 'local feel' place - everything tasted fresh and adequate - I enjoyed that the toast from their bread was more than just your soft boring typical toast bread."}
{"text":"Cool little find. Average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in. I noticed nobody even needed a menu lol. They were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their \"usual\". Family feel for sure :)"}
{"text":"I stopped at Wandas Yesterday....and AGAIN this morning! I live down the street and always wondered about this place. Its a small unique, quaint,clean place. The food was great and the service was even better. There were 2 waitresses and they were both fantastic!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My office co-workers and I have been going to Wanda's every single Wednesday morning since 2008. All 6 of us stopped last week, after 5 years, because the service has gotten ridiculously bad.

Wanda's goes through employees very quickly, because, from what we've been told by a number of waitresses, the owner is a complete jerk. The newest round of employees, probably disgruntled, do not even try.

You'll never get a refill on your coffee, iced tea, or soda. What makes this ridiculous is the place is so small and never busy. The wait staff mostly sits in the kitchen, and many times recently I've had to go back there to find them to get a refill.

Wish we could still go there, but instead we've switched to U.S. Egg down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent stop for breakfast! We had veggie frittata and raisin French-toast among other things at the table. Great service and grub!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years since it's close to my work. It's a nice break from some of the other neighborhood offerings. I generally like to treat myself to a breakfast burrito on the days when I have to go to work extra early since they open around the time I start getting hungry for food. These things are heaven in a tortilla. Absolutely love them. I always get the original with potato, egg, bacon and cheese. Thankfully today is an early day and I am headed over in a couple of hours to get one."}
{"text":"No Fish Called Wanda
By The Rue

What's there not to like about Wanda's, 
I have the hot's for that chick LaFonda,
Kip rides the bus, doesn't drive a Honda,
And Shelby takes a bath with Rhonda.

Waitress asked what can she get me,
So I went with the Tiajuana turkey,
My iced tea was never half empty,
When I got back to work I had to pee.

My side order was potato salad,
This poem is the next big love ballad,
Inside it certainly wasn't pallid,
Good thing my debit card was valid.

My friend went with the southwest chicken club,
It came on sourdough and wasn't a sub,
They don't serve beer it isn't a pub,
Just a good place that makes good grub.

I RULE!!"}
{"text":"Their Eggs Benedict always delicious. Fast seating, fast friendly service, best food."}
{"text":"Hits the spot! Good size portions and their eggs benedict options are so yummy!  Worth the price.  Next time I will take a picture. I cleaned my plate!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is amazing and always makes you feel at home. I'm obsessed with their breakfast burritos. And the biscuits and gravy? Amazing!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast fair, served up in a casual setting. Best option when you're in this neighborhood. Table service is quick and friendly, or you can order it to go."}
{"text":"Very good, generous potions and the waitresses are always nice and friendly! Great place for breakfast- pancakes are very large!"}
{"text":"We would drive from Maricopa when we first moved to the valley to eat here. Then we moved to Mesa, and we would still drive to Wonderful Wanda's for breakfast. Food is tasty and the service was exceptional with Melanie and Ashley.  Unfortunately, neither one works there anymore, so we probably won't be driving back to eat there."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast here for the first time and it was amazing! Mom and pop type of place. Great customer service, great food and good portions! Our server LeAnn was so genuine, sweet and on top of it. The owners of the place were working along side of everyone, busing and serving tables. I had the redneck Benedict which was so delicious and more then I could even eat. We will be back to say the least!"}
{"text":"No bueno, nothing to write home about. I prefer US EGG or good egg . Had Biscuit and gravy , and it was ok. Inquired about corn beef hash and it's from a Flippin can."}
{"text":"I was happy with the service of this quaint little place. It was a very clean and neat place but I was a little shocked at the prices for the breakfast.  The bacon was very good and so was my blueberry pancake.  I was not too happy with the hash browns but all in all everything else was ok. I will visit again"}
{"text":"Small little place down to earth quiet setting awesome biscuits and gravy you have to come before 11 or you won't get breakfast"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible the owner is in no way fit for customer service and or customer satisfaction the dish I had ordered no one including myself had no idea 2hat it was I tried very politely to explain my thoughts should would not heart meet me half way it was an experience I will continue to proceed until. The nessecary satisfaction is met"}
{"text":"I haven't yelped in a long time but my experience this morning was so great, that I have to. My boyfriend and I are house sitting this weekend in the neighborhood and so we wanted to find a local breakfast place this morning. I checked my Yelp app to see what was around and this showed up.

The staff was phenomenal. The inside is kinda small and was pretty loud (it was busy) so we sat outside. We interacted with three different staff members (1 who sat us inside, the waitress who would have been waiting on us had we kept our table inside and then our waitress when we moved to an outside table). All were friendly and had smiles on their faces. Genuine smiles. 

The menu was wonderful and everything sounded great. The salsa is made fresh daily and it was to die for so if you can get something that comes with the salsa, do it.

One breakfast burrito, a side of sausage, eggs Benedict w/bacon and two cups of coffee was only $21. Great prices, great staff, amazing food.

Even though we live downtown Phoenix, we will be coming back to Wanda's!!"}
{"text":"We wanted a quick breakfast that wouldn't break the bank, as we just moved into the area.  Menu was okay, had some good options.  Service was quick, not many people in there on a Monday morning at 8 am.  We went the cheap route and just ordered eggs and hash browns with a cup of coffee.  I don't like really runny eggs, so I ordered them over medium - they came out over easy with goopy white-stuff - YUCK.  Coffee was meh, as well.  Hopefully it was caffeinated.  We won't be going back.  Glad others have had good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered here from Uber Eats for breakfast and got the original breakfast burrito with no bacon. It was a decent size and certainly filling with potatoes, eggs and cheese. It comes with delicious fresh salsa and quite possibly one of the best breakfast burritos I've had."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Chandler and have driven past this place a lot and have been wanting to try it for months. Yesterday (Wednesday) morning I went with some friends (picky friends)to eat breakfast and we all enjoyed every bite. Service was great and she was the only server working at the time and the food was delicious and came out perfect and fast. It is very nice because you can see the chef and the kitchen from the dining area, which looks very clean. The dining area is very small but cute and charming with local art hanging on the walls. I will be returning here for breakfast again soon."}
{"text":"I had previously ordered from here on Uber Eats. Requested no eggs in a burrito. I received the burrito as ordered with no complaints. Today, I ordered again through Uber Eats and requested no eggs in a burrito. Once I got my food, there were eggs in my burrito. I called the restaurant to see if I could get a replacement. I was told my first person and the manager that they would not offer a replacement because there screen didn't show the no eggs request. I told both individuals my screen did. The manager's said it was Uber Eats' fault and to call them. Major disappointment. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment."}
{"text":"Got up early.   Went out for breakfast.  Was not sure when we first went to the door seemed to be slow for business and that's not a good sign.  But we stayed.  what a great breakfast we had after all.  The French toast was to die for.  Would we go back ?  Absolute we would.   And to end this the traffic was pouring in while we sat and people watched"}
{"text":"My family and I go every Saturday morning we get the chance. It's not the cheapest price, but the waitresses know us by name and it's a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've seen this place forever but never had time to check it out. I love simple solid roadside greasy spoon style eats and this place did not disappoint. 

Staff was pleasant and efficient serving up working folks style eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy done right, in a pleasant no frills yet comfy setting. Clientele ran the gamut from drywall guys, a couple lawyer looking dudes to two moms with a baby. Also love that it's not a chain as I am always partial to supporting local mom and pop ventures. Reminds me of those middle of no where places you might find along Route 66 or something. 

And in my book it all adds up to two big thumbs up for  Wanda's."}
{"text":"Great service, but everthing else was just ok. I had the pancakes, which were huge and tasted like they were made 2 days ago. My family agreed that I make better ones. My son had the French Toast - he didn't like it. The restaurant is very small but cozy and family friendly. Too bad the food was just average and there are other better choices around."}
{"text":"It seems like breakfast place but not anytime like most places open for just breakfast and lunch. Was pretty bummed to be told no eggs! Also kinda rude."}
{"text":"Love this place small, simple and good food the best deal is their omelette   Friendly staff and it's locally owned."}
{"text":"Great little place! Don't miss this gem when in Chandler, AZ area. Jalapeño cheddar pancakes w prickly pear syrup!!?? YES!!!"}
{"text":"The western burrito was amazing! The salsa they use is so good! Good coffee, fast and friendly service and very good food! Will go again :)"}
{"text":"Thought it was a little odd you waited outside to be seated. But man oh man was the food good. They have a lot of selections to pick from. Pancakes are massive. Good place to stop at!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Wanda's about 4 times since moving here and always enjoyed it.  I wouldn't classify it as an overly greasy , greasy spoon.  I think it's a very comfy place that reminds me of little Mom and Pop's from back east. Since I seem to stick to the breakfast MO... it's been good each time.  They have good diner coffee, nothing exotic, nor was I expecting it.  The waitresses are all very nice, with just the right amount of chattiness to make you feel at home, but not too much.  My breakfast today was a mushroom and cheese omelette + spinach.  My plate of food was huge and very tasty and with Coffee and Tax only $10.  I'll have to stop by here more often.

- Mushroom and Swiss Omelette + Spinach"}
{"text":"Excellent for highly recommend for anyone looking for a good breakfast. Local restaurant small but the food is great"}
{"text":"We found this little place by accident.  OMG the food was so good and exactly what we were looking for in a hearty breakfast.  Next time we'll try going for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. We were disappointed. The service was great and people are friendly but the food is very plain. If you don't like seasonings in your food and like your food very plain then you will like this place. We like our food very seasoned so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Although Wonderful Wanda's is not what it used to be, It's still pretty darn good. Anyone would be missing out if they did not order one of their fantastic breakfast burritos with their flavorful salsa."}
{"text":"This place was busy when we arrived, but we really only waited for about 10 minutes max. Once seated, it was very clear that this place has many regulars, which I love. The food was not anything out of the norm, but more importantly it was good, home cooked breakfast food you would get at your grandma's house. I enjoyed the friendly staff as well as the fact that they gave me an entire pot of coffee for the table..no need to wait for a top off!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast sausage. Tastes like home made sausage from the old days. Appears to be hand formed patties and taste so good. A meal is sausage and a sunnyside up egg sandwich. Service is always good. Not the most glamorous place but I just drove 5 miles out of my way to get that sausage.  Wife got pancakes and sausage. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Traditional menu. Food was good.  Bacon was crispy just how I asked for. Will definitely come back.   The restaurant is smaller so it gets a little loud."}
{"text":"Was disappointed years ago but thought it was time to try again. Bad decision. Over priced,no ambiance,had to sit at a very small table, greasy left over hashbrowns and paper thin bacon. so many better choices within blocks"}
{"text":"We LOVE Wonderful Wanda's. The menu has tons of yummy options. Our waitress was wonderful and made me an Iced coffee even with it not being an option. (I got one to go for free as well.) Our meals came out quick and were soooo yummy! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food, very large portions, and talk about FAST service! I really enjoyed how they leave the coffee carafe at the table to allow you to refill. Will try here again. Many different menu items to choose from. I had the breakfast combo (eggs, hash-brown, OMG BACON 6 pieces-yum!!, biscuit and gravy) and my Hub had the cinnamon raisin french toast."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! Mushroom Swiss Burger was perfect! And the fries were delicious!! The southwest chicken was very satisfying as well! Definitely getting food from here again!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful little restraunt!  Quick service no matter how busy, very friendly employees, clean. I highly recommend this place for breakfast- I always get the Redneck Benedict - there is nothing else the menu for me!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast here today, I have to it was not wonderful and it was pricey. I won't be going back. Very generic subpar food at high prices."}
{"text":"You know I could eat breakfast food every meal of the day.  Well, the meals when I'm not eating hot dogs, pizza, tacos, burgers, or gyros.  We hadn't been to Wanda's in over 2 years and I really have no reason why.  It's a nice little local joint that cranks out some good standard breakfast food.  They've remodeled since I've been there and the colors inside are very pleasant.  

We rolled in this morning and ordered the King breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, and a pancake.  We also got the two egg combo which is the same but with a biscuit and gravy instead of a pancake.  Now granted, we were hungry, but once the food arrived there was very little talking.  Just eating.  Great breakfast!  And we hustled on out of there because the joint is small and our server said a party of 30-40 would be arriving around 9:00.  The food is always good and the staff is always friendly.  I'll be sure to go back more often."}
{"text":"I have to say I've seen this place so many times but I was unsure of entering. I'm so glad my husband suggested going in. It's super quaint, yummy fresh tasting food, clean and has quality customer service. Family of three ate for $25. 

The biscuits were soft, buttery and warm. Try one!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Wanda's is a great family owned business.  Homemade food, hearty sandwiches and yummy cookies. Great breakfast at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We went to Wanda's for Mother's Day Breakfast with 6 in our party.  My Grandson has a severe peanut allergy so we asked if there would be any cross contamination in the kitchen.  While the waitress was checking on that we were served water, coffee and 3 apple juice drinks for the 3 kids under 8 years old.  Before we could drink our drinks, the waitress came back and told us peanut contamination is a real possibility so we excused ourselves and prepared to leave, when we presented with a bill for $16!.  Now I don't mind paying something for the 3 apple juices but I did not get one sip of coffee.  I deemed this policy as poor customer service.  Basically, we got charged $16 because they could not guarantee the safety of their food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! If you want some good old fashioned breakfast food at decent prices stop here. All of the good was tasty, the service is amazing, and everyone is friendly. What more could you want? Keep in mind this places gets super busy on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Love it. Delicious. My girlfriend and I would go here for breakfast nearly every Sunday morning. It's not over the top delicious but everything is good. After going for a few weeks in a row the waitresses knew us and treated us like regulars which was great.

Southwest omelette is my favorite. Whoever makes the salsa does it right. Their biscuits are amazing. If you don't mind your heart stopping the Redneck Benedict is a must try."}
{"text":"Not to be mean but my fiancé and I have been eyeing this place for a while and finally went to check it out ... As we approached the place was very small but there was a lot of people, the older couple standing in front of us was finally seated and we were waiting for about 10 mins in front of the store literally two feet away from the table with guest eating... Nobody ever acknowledged us or greeted us, everyone made eye contact but no one seemed to take the time to let us know they see us standing there .... I can see people feeling uncomfortable because we are literally standing next to the door and no one said anything... As much as I wanted to try the place despite it being small we will probably never go back ... A simple hey I see you, it'll be a moment ... Was all it took, but all the staff continued to ignore and run around ignoring customer eye contact...."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! My husband and I are constantly looking for new breakfast places to try and this one was a home run. It was nice not having to wait 45 min or more to get a table. Food was yummy and came out of the kitchen fast and hot. I had the French toast and my husband had the breakfast stack. Both were really good. Our server was awesome! He had a great personality and spent time chatting with us a bit. If you like holes in the wall and are willing to try a new place, this is it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Wonderful Wanda's after Keegan's redid their breakfast menu and changed it for the worse. My first impression was that the dining room was extremely small and crowded. I then faced an even more unpleasant surprise when I had to go to the bathroom and realized that I would have to walk through the middle of the kitchen to get to it. The bathroom was about the size of a closet and pretty dirty. The service and the food did not do anything to improve my opinion of the restaurant. The service was slow and disorganized-- I watched my food sit on the counter for a good five minutes before the waitress brought it over, and when she finally did, it was barely warm anymore. The food itself was pretty mediocre. I will not be back again."}
{"text":"NOT CORPORATE
Simple menu, Simple prices
Nice service, clean little place, Patio service 

This is my new Sat morning hang-out to meet the gal pals!  Easy in. Easy out. Nice pot of coffee on the table.  I DO WISH they would decide to make homemade corned beef hash. Fresh fluffy eggs (not greasy)."}
{"text":"Good home cooked tasting breakfast food. I have been here twice and have enjoyed the food and service both times. The staff is very polite, even the cook serves up a few smile you can see through a service window. If your looking for a reasonably priced home cooked meal defiantly give them a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful Wanda's was a nice spot to grab breakfast. The servers were friendly and pretty attentive. I ordered bacon, eggs, sausage, and toast. The food was brought out in a timely manner and the food was tasty and there was plenty to eat. The only real concern I had was that the extra meat cost a hefty $2.50 extra, so if you get more than eggs and a meat be prepared to pay for it. The meal came out to be around $11 a person. I would recommend this spot for a nice breakfast. Just be attentive to what you are ordering."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast! We decided to take a chance on this place ... because it got such good ratings online.  This place did not disappoint!   The food is soooo yummy and the people are so friendly!  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Usually service and food are very good. This morning they were a little crowded and no room for 3. We said we would wait outside for a table. They sat 2 other groups. We went back inside and there was no room. We said we were going elsewhere as it was appearant they were not interested in our business. Denny's sat us right away and the food was better anyway."}
{"text":"Wanda's is OK. Being a small independent diner, they have a lot of breakfast options, and at very reasonable prices. I pass it each day I go bowling, when its closed. I have never been on this side of town when they are open until yesterday. This is the review for a Sunday brunch at Wanda's:

~Fud/Drink~
I went with family, who love to eat breakfast the traditional way, with a lot of eggs and carbs. Their dishes were huge, and they were satisfied. I asked if they had any complaints, because I needed their perspective, and their was not a peep from them. So this spot is awesome for generic omelets and pancake options on the cheap...BUT, as for me, I choose to eat healthy...This, of course, back-fired on me. They only had one reasonably healthy option on the menu, oatmeal. That's it. I kinda figured that would be the case, why would they have healthy options when it was just waste in their fridge? I asked for the Oatmeal and a side of egg whites. I asked for TWO egg whites scrambled. But, what I got was a shriveled piece of something on a plate. Four bites and it was gone. I was not thrilled, I expected at least a little bit more on the plate... As for the Oatmeal I ordered, it was generic, as was the shriveled egg whites. It tasted good, the nuts they gave me however tasted old, I did not use them. They are a breakfast/lunch diner, and in being this, do not serve alcohol, that's a give in. My family told me the coffee was very tasty for a small joint, they would all come back to eat here again if in the area. I would listen to them, it is a nice option for a traditional American Breakfast. 

~Atmosphere/Service~
The waitstaff make this place a great destination. 
were quick to get the food out, and were personable when coming back to check in. Despite being a full house, they were diligent in check back in with us. You can tell they care, the waitresses all had smiles on their faces as they came around filling coffee cups and handing out dishes. You come to expect that at a mom & pop spot, good customer service. As for the atmosphere, its the usual set-up for a small indy diner, a small space with a few tables and outside options. Not much decor, which is fine. 
~Extras/Rating~
 If you like breakfast and are in the Chandler area, there are a number of spots to eat at. They get get crowded quickly, and most locals know that Wanda's is just down the road. I highly recommend it for the average person wanting a cheap breakfast in the area. Don't stop in if you are on a diet. I enjoyed my time with the family, but unless I am in the area and really hankering an omelet its not my kind of spot. The food is cheap and the plates are tasty and large. Support local, eat local! Skip the IHOP's and try Wanda's out. At least you know you will be treated better. Average food gets average ratings, but a solid 3 stars go out primarily to waitresses who did a good job!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some home cooking this is the place to go. 
Locally owned and operated Wonderful Wands's is just that, wonderful. 
The staff is friendly and efficient and are willing to accommodate any changes to your order. 

I have come here for lunch and usually call ahead to have burritos ready before heading into the office. 

The food is savory and tastes just like grandma made. I especially like coming here for lunch because there is never a wait, the prices are affordable and service is quick. 

Great little hole in the wall spot that will soon become your favorite place"}
{"text":"So delicious! We had already eaten there yesterday morning, and decided to return again this morning! We've been in Arizona for three days now and it's our new favorite spot! It's a small diner, but we sat outside both times, and dropped a couple ice cubes in our coffee and it was great! The service is incredibly fast, and the rumors are true-the salsa is fantastic! I had the original burrito the first day which was completely homemade, including the tortilla! It was pretty heavy and I could only finish half of it, but delicious nonetheless! The second day I ordered the Ham and Cheese Omelet and it was one of the best I've had, it came with REAL hashbrowns and nicely buttered toast! Such a yummy little spot! It has a wait on the weekends, but during the week we sat right down and had our food minutes after our waitress scribbled it down in her notepad! It beats denny's, cracker barrel, and any other chain around! Super satisfied :)"}
{"text":"They had the opportunity to win my business. I go to breakfast every Wednesday and Thursday in that area. This places opens at 7, when I walked in at 7:05 - nobody greeted me, I sat my self while two cooks, cleaned and wash dishes. Is at myself and searched for a greet or waitress but there was none. 

I finally grab a menu, the lunch menu because they didn't have the breakfast menus out. 

Still waited until I went to ask one if the cooks \"you guys are open right?\" - to which I got no reply then the waitress came out. She have me the breakfast menu then told me to sit at a two-top since I was alone. Mind you, I seated myself. I told her I was charging my laptop and I wanted to leave it plugged in. She said ,\"okay we're not busy that's fine\". 

Of course it's fine, I sat myself at this \"full service restaurant at she called it.\"

Service is a 1 star only because I couldn't rate it as a zero. 

The food was a 1. I had a Denver omelette, orange juice and French toast. It was at best a 2. I am grateful for the food so I won't give it less. The waitress checked on me 1 time to make sure everything was okay, she smiles and told me to have a good day upon leaving...

Don't go here.

There's a US Egg down the street. Go there."}
{"text":"Apparently they don't allow motorcycle riders here any longer as we hurt their regular business. Well the food is terrible, service is even worse so we will gladly take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the Eggs Benedict at Wanda's and it was very flavorful. The downside was that the egg was fried and no poached. The service was very good and the people were friendly! Definitely a place worth checking out. I was referred by someone from the DMV."}
{"text":"AWESOME breakfast burritos !! I always order the Blue Ribbon Breakfast Burrito, it's like a little farm warped in a tortilla!!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed coming here for Sunday breakfast. Their hash is excellent and my friend likes the red neck Benedict plate.   Biscuits are spot on !"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and the portion are huge. The price is fair and I recommend the biscuits and gravy. They are the best I have ever had, the biscuits are very moist.
It was a bit on comfortable to use the restroom do to the fact you have to walk through the kitchen and its also very tiny. This is my only reason I would give it a 4 and not a 5"}
{"text":"What happened to Wanda's?  The food is decent, but nothing amazing. I remember the service being very friendly and the prices fair. I've gone there a few times with coworkers for breakfast over the past few months, and each time there has been \"something\" like the food sitting on the counter for 5+ minutes or the orders being wrong. I remember one co-worker asking for an extra piece of bacon instead of the 2 eggs in his combo, and the waitress got a bit aggravated and said, \"sorry, we don't do substitutions\". Really? 

Today was probably the last time I'll go there. I took my daughter and dog there this morning and sat outside. Our waitress was nice, and the food came out fast, but once we were done, I waited for 10+ minutes before I had to go in and ask for the check leaving my 4 year old out with the dog. Then I asked for a to-go container for our leftovers, and the waitress took our food to go box up.  When she came back with the credit card receipt, I asked for the food and she didn't know what happened to it. Turns out she just threw it away. Oh well. Then, I don't usually worry about the price of my food, but the total was almost $19 for my breakfast combo and a kids plate.  I think I can get a much better breakfast for 1 adult and 1 child for $23 (after tip)."}
{"text":"Food average at best.  Service was quick but server not friendly at all.  Small place.  Water glass had food on the inside of it as if it wasn't cleaned properly.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Fast service, excellent food. 
Today was my first visit. I found the restaurant just by driving down Chandler Blvd. Upon approaching the restaurant there is a sign outside that says \"please seat yourself\", maybe it was because it was my first time, but I think I was the only one who came inside to be seated. Everyone else remained outside waiting for a server to open the door and greet them. It was a little bit weird but a nice touch. I had the breakfast special White Chicken Chili Omelet. The omelet was topped with the chili, I didn't expect beans in the chili, but they were easy to pick out. My meal arrived within moments of ordering, which worried me due to the speed of service; but the food did not feel like it was pre-prepared. The Omelette was good as where the hash browns and side of toast. The staff was polite. 
My one gripe if I could find any, was that you had to ask for water if you ordered coffee or juice, unlike other restaurants that provide it for every customer. This makes sense from a business stance, so not a big deal. 
I will definitely return and this is likely to be a weekend favorite."}
{"text":"The breakfast (ham & cheese omelet) was the best, but the service was not the best. The toast was cold, my wifes blueberry pancake was terrible."}
{"text":"This was my first and definitely last time eating at this establishment. My friend and I came in for breakfast at 8:40am and there was nobody there except for us. Our waitress, Sarah, walked up to the table and instead of saying good morning or even asking us what we would like to order she started telling us all about her diet. My friend and I ordered one breakfast burrito to share which ended up taking over 20 minutes to cook and bring out to the table. While we were waiting on our food 3 other parties showed up and had all gotten their food before us. When we asked why everyone else who came in after us had already gotten their food and we were still waiting Sarah's response was, \"they all got something that didnt have potatoes\" and then just walked away. When the food was finally brought out to us Sarah never came back to ask how it was or if we needed anything else. She brought the check and then just ignored us when we tried to pay for it. Hands down the worst service I've ever received from any establishment."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here a few times and always thought the food and service were good. I think the prices are reasonable. My only complaint is the place is too small. there have been many times the hubby and I go there and there is simply nowhere to sit, so we end up leaving. I wish they would expand the dining area as I would love to eat here more. I hate chain restaurants, but when this place is too crowded I end up at a crappy chain."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive place to have breakfast or lunch.  The service is pretty good too.  We walk here for lunch."}
{"text":"Not That Wonderful Wanda................

I walked into a small and stuffy dining room that was hot and smelled like Grease.........I Left the same way.

I did end up staying for a sandwich, since I was starving!

I ordered a tuna sandwich (see pics) comes with a pickle and a cookie for $4.99...not bad.

Surprisingly the sandwich was quite good the pickle was fresh and crisp too, the cookie.....meh.

So even though I liked my lunch I 'm not sure I could go here again just based on the fact that I don't like leaving smelling like a dirty french fry. 

Maybe they could get a better exhaust system to accommodate me?"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to give this place a 4-5 star rating but I didn't get an accurate order. The omelette was perfect!  I ordered the Heartland and switched the mushrooms for green chilies and it was better than expected. I also switched out the hash browns for home fries and that's were it went wrong. I ordered \"well done-extra crispy\" as I always do for bfast potatoes. They were cooked but no where well done. When I asked about that when she delivered the food she told me that it would take long to do that to the potatoes and my omelette would get cold. 
SO IT WAS MY FAULT. once I got the bill my specifics were not on the tix so the cook never knew what how to prepare my food. I STILL GOT CHARGED THE UPGRADE for the home fries. And that's where the stars were lost. I get my home fries didn't get prepared like I asked but to still charge that person? Either she doesn't know how to handle this situation or just doesn't care enough to pay closer attention. Sad because it takes away from the food that is really good."}
{"text":"Owner is absolutely horrible. Called to see if they were looking for servers and his only response was \"no.\" before hanging up on me, without even giving me a chance to say anything else. I used to be a frequent diner here before it got under new management. Whoever took over got rid of all of the friendly servers are replaced them with mediocre, unkind servers who seem miserable. This place has seriously gone downhill... shame."}
{"text":"Magical Melissa took good care of us.  Great food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Don't get offended Wanda...but you're kind of a greasy spoon type of place. I usually love these types of places so it's not really a bad thing. Small dining area so you may experience a wait on a weekend. The biscuits and gravy had an odd flavor to me. I always expect restaurant gravy to taste like my dad's gravy from the cast iron skillet and it rarely does. The sausage patties I sampled from the BF's meal were great! 
I'll give you another try Wanda...if I'm in the area and hungry but probably won't travel out of my way. Sorry."}
{"text":"Old school tiny little place. Server was nice, the place was clean. Menu was simple enough, it had all the classics. We were getting our car fixed and this place is right by the shop, so we stopped in. 

For us, the food was not memorable. The biscuits were a decent size, but they were dry and the gravy was bland. Hubby's burrito was also a decent size, but there wasn't much bacon. Salsa was good. 

Ultimately, the food was filling and edible with a little added Tabasco, ketchup, salt and pepper. Just not anything to return for, in our opinion."}
{"text":"It wasn't \"wonderful\" but not awful. Wanda definitely knows how to make biscuits and gravy! (Not many places in AZ do and that makes me a sad-yet-less-fat panda.) I came here on a suggestion for that very reason. Delicious!

As for the rest of the menu, it's very inexpensive, and expect what you are paying for. It tastes and looks like most things are cooked in large batches (hashbrowns particularly). The bacon was very thin and salty, and the coffee isn't quite burnt, but tastes like it's been sitting in one of those 5 gallon commercial pots. 

The building is very small and only seats about 20 inside, if that many. It gets very stuffy and the furnishings are very cheap, so not exactly a great atmosphere. Service was good and fast, and again the biscuits and gravy were done properly and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing great.  I think they use cheap ingredients.  However, when they charged us for water for our dogs I couldn't believe it...   then I ordered eggs for our two dogs, they brought our food in a half of a Togo styrofoam container and charged us twice for the containers...   how f@@king cheap.   The only reason they didn't get 1 star was the hostess said she had to charge us because her boss said so but she wanted to pay for it out of her own pocket...   we refused the generous and gracious offer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite.  Service was quick and efficient.  Food was delivered, in short order, no pun, and was good.  For a greasy little spoon place, it works."}
{"text":"While visiting the area on vacation, we stopped here for breakfast. Huge portions and yummy! Prices are a little high, especially for side meats. I'd rather prices be a couple of dollars lower and get portions that a diner can eat instead of oversized portions that are more than you can eat."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. I drive by it almost every day, and have heard good things. One day I decided to check it out when I was craving corned beef hash. Sadly, I was unimpressed. It was okay, not bad, but just fairly bland and disappointing. I shouldn't need to salt and hot sauce hash to give it flavor. I might give it a go another time and try something else, but it was a pretty meh experience. Everyone was great and nice, but I know I won't be going here if I'm craving hash again."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but good is a stretch. Basic ingredients, the food was something anyone could have easily made at home. They messed up my friend's salad, twice. I ordered the Tijuana sandwich which had no flavor. The fries looked like something from McDonald's minus the quality, and that's assuming you think McDonald's fries are quality. Overall I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"stopped in for breakfast after a race! food was great service was quick. found it on yelp with the cool name! Kinda disappointed Wanda didn't make my omelette (;"}
{"text":"Really good food, I got the breakfast combo which is 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and 1 biscuit and gravy. It was delicious.  The service is amazing, very kind. I would recommend this place! Prices are a bit high"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! My mother in law and I stumbled across Wanda's one weekend and are loyal customers!
The breakfast is a stick-to-your-ribs-what-my-mama-used-to-make experience!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great atmosphere! It was my family and I's first time here and we loved it! I had the California breakfast burrito with bacon, egg, cheese and avocado with salsa. It was delicious with a really great homemade-tasting tortilla. They had a super stack special with both my mom and my sister had. And they loved it as well. The staff is friendly and inviting. My family and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"this is a mom/pop place. pretty good food for a cheap price and you get a lot as well, the staff is friendly and the service was really fast which surprised me as i sat down the waitress took my order and not 60 seconds later it seemed my food was being served. that's quick fast service i was real impressed. keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Tried the heartland omelet which was pretty good. Good first impression. The service was quick got our food in like 10 minutes. Waitresses are really nice. Its a small place and there were a few regulars there."}
{"text":"Ok, so, I finally ate at Wanda's.  It is located right near the Chandler Harley Davidson, and its alright.  The seating is really intimate, and rather small.  The largest table in this place is for seating of 4. I didnt care for how small it was, in regards to limited seating.  They do have outdoor seating, but again, they lost points with me for only having tables for either 2 or 4.  What I DO like about it, is that the service was quick, and its not the usual chain resturants like IHOP or Waffle house.  Limited menu, only open a few hours a day (like 7-3) and primarily have a breakfast and lunch menu."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Prices are very affordable and the food is ok. If I were to go back though it would be more to support an independent restaurant over a chain rather than for the food. On the plus side, the vegetables in the omelet were generous even if it wasn't the best omelet I've had for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went in for a late breakfast. Had a hard time getting a coffee refill. Omelette was pretty good. Hash browns were nasty. Almost a two but I will round up today."}
{"text":"Wanda's is a basic Diner with a Mexican twist.  I've eaten here once and it was good enough that I'll be back.  

The food was fresh, fast and good.  I had a very basic scrambled eggs with cheese, hash browns with onions, toast and bacon.  This breakfast for me is the yardstick for judging Diners.  The eggs were perfect-not firm and overdone, not the least bit runny.  Toast, bacon, potato's were just right as well.

As Amy B said, the space is on the small side and seating is limited.

A hands down winner over IHOP, Denny's or any other chain Diner."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! Staff are awesomely attentive and friendly. The restaurant has a family friendly vibe. Their prices are great and he food is well, wonderful! I highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite breakfast places!  When we lived in Chandler (miss you so much) we used to go to Wanda's before Archery lessons right next door.  Great breakfast menu and a wonderfully friendly staff.  Its always good to have a home town breakfast eatery and for us Wanda's will always be it!  Stop by and sit outside.  Wonderful is a great word for this place.  I've had everything on the Breakfast menu and its all good.  Outstanding coffee too!"}
{"text":"This place used to make the best breakfast burritos- I always get the farmers burrito.  Unfortunately ever since this restaurant changed hands the burrito went downhill- 95% potatoes and a hint of sausage.  This is no exaggeration.  Maybe their other breakfast items are better.  But, I will say they still make the best salsa."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a close authentic breakfast and lunch restaurant and wonderful wandas is the place to go 
their burritos are delicious especially the California 
Give them a chance you will not regret it"}
{"text":"My family and I go every Sunday after Church and we love this place. In the world of chains like Ihop and The Good egg with their grumpy servers and mundane food, this place is a welcome change. Yes, the place is small and the bathroom is tiny and behind the kitchen (really, who cares, I don't come for the toilet) - biscuits and gravy are great and the servers are efficient and friendly. Never had a bad breakfast there."}
{"text":"Was fortunate enough to visit this esablishment 3 times while I was in Arizona for bike week 2016. I absolutely loved everything about it! The food was excellent, the service friendly and prompt and the coffee hot and unlimited. It's a small place so it can get a bit noisy but it's a small sacrifice to make. This is an old school breakfast place just like you grew up with. Needless to say, next time im in the Chandler area I will be starting each day at truly Wonderful Wandas!"}
{"text":"Great - inexpensive little diner. It is cozy - but better that than pricey.  If you're the claustrophobic type try eating outside, it's often quicker anyway.  They do stay pretty busy at peak hours, but the wait is never more than a few minutes. The family and I have a weekend breakfast there 1-2 x month and while the food is not fancy or especially memorable, it is good and consistent. So, for the price you really can't go wrong with Wanda's."}
{"text":"A decent stop for breakfast. The pancakes look great. My egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich o English muffin was good but could have used more cheese. My wife's Southwestern omelet was really good but spicier than my taste; she loved it. Coffee is reasonable commercial quality. The ambiance is straight from the Midwest or rural New England. Given the absence of a side, I thought it a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Fast service and excellent food. It's not over done meaning the portion sizes were perfect. The corned beef hash gets two thumbs up. The eggs Benedict was perfect as it wasn't drowning in hollandaise sauce. Great breakfast without being stuffed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely got a bang for our buck here! The amount of food given was plentiful and the staff was very nice. However, it was pretty cramped and hot in this location, i'm sure that this contributes to its \"homey\" feel but eating here in the dead of summer was not a good idea. The amount of food was impressive but ultimately flavorless."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Glad they still served breakfast at 1! We sat outside in the patio with our pup. We had the King Breakfast and the egg combo. Service was excellent. Will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast in the north Chandler area, and best deal as well. Super cozy place with a back east feel about it. I've taken groups of 8 plus in there before and they've all been super accommodating, great service and food check it out!"}
{"text":"It was our server's third day on the job but she did fantastic.  The food, which was great and home-cooked tasting, was delivered quickly and hot even though the place was packed and there were six in our group."}
{"text":"Food quality, quantity and service never disappoint. The prices do. 1 meal with drink and a tip = $14."}
{"text":"Grabbing some lunch after archery!

We stopped in here for lunch since it is right next store to Archery Headquarters. This place is tiny, has about 8 - 10 tables and a few tables outside.

The place was packed and now we know why. They only serve breakfast and lunch. I personally had the Philly Cheese-steak - which was good, wish the cheese was melted more. I didn't feel that the inside of the sandwich was hot. That was a bummer, but it did taste good.

Both Heather and Austin had a BLT and the fries. The BLTS' were VERY good! The Fries were the skinny ones and they were very good. Lightly salted which made them even better.

Over all this place is good. I will return and try something different next time though."}
{"text":"What a great find, in the land of the chain restaurants. 

After lots of drinking and gambling, we we're driving around, and thought let's give it a try! I try very hard to support small places like this. And, yes, as mentioned before, the place is very small. 

Service was excellent. They brought coffee and water right away, and they have flavored creamer. Always a highlight for me. I ordered an omelet w/ham, spinach, mushrooms, and swiss. It was delicious. The hashbrowns came out nice and crispy. Hubby had the cornbeef hash, and it must have been good, because he downed it in no time. Great prices also. Under $20 for the two of us. 

If I'm ever in the area again, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Wanda's for many years. The menu use to be very limited but the current ownership has expanded it for the good. It was packed this Sunday but a table for 2 was available and I was able to jump the wait. Ordered the Avocado Benedict and it was outstanding. Spend the extra $0.79 for the home fries. The only reason I did not give a 5 out of 5 because I turned my table for it to be wider and read the Sunday paper ( yes, some of us still do that) and the owner turned it back because she said it would restrict part of the walkway area. Alright I might agree but when I moved it , it appeared ok to me ( never had anybody do that before). A minor complaint but not that big a deal. A special shout out to Casey who although the place was packed and he was busy, got my coffee, took my order and at the end thanked me for my patience.  Last suggestion would be to put a clip board out front to allow patrons to put their name on a wait list when they are busy !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service!!!One of the best egg benadicts I have ever had.   absolutely enjoyed my Sunday morning breakfast"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot! It's small and cozy. Quick service and the kitchen churns out good food very quickly. The corned beef hash was amazing and my eggs were perfect. Highly recommend if your looking for an awesome small business breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. Eggs runny and cold, nothing seasoned, service so slow you think everyone must be on heroin. Rude wait staff, manager, and cooks, it's as if a crew of trailer park tweakers opened a breakfast joint.  And cooks that look like they were just released after serving time for child molestation.  And a dead cockroach in the corner. What a disaster, never again."}
{"text":"We only went to this place once and I wasn't very impressed.  We had to wait outside in the hot sun for a table since the restaurant is so small.  The food was nothing exciting and it is not a comfy atmosphere at all.  The only good thing is that the prices are low and I am sure it would be fast service on a weekday since you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Excellent home cooked style breakfast - the ham is twice as large as you'd expect and of excellent taste and quality - eggs toast hash browns ham and coffee will be $10 you won't leave hungry and you'll be happy with the quality - servers are always friendly - always packed on cool weekend mornings"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Conveniently located next to the motorcycle shop we were just at. Food was good. Ordered a BLT and a Patty Melt. On Fridays they include a fresh baked cookie with your order. Casual place. Will definitely come back. We here the breakfast here is good too."}
