{"text":"Street parking right on Brookline Boulevard-- don't forget to feed the meter! 

My friend and I stopped in to this place around 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday (we'd skipped lunch, but were hungry, so we figured we'd have \"lunner;\" I was craving pasta and we saw this place as we were driving by and decided to give it a try).

This is a BYOB establishment with a $5.00 corkage fee (which I feel is an unreasonable rate, but that's me).  NOTE:  There is a Wine and Spirits store 2 doors down!  We weren't in the mood to have an alcoholic beverage with our meal, so we didn't take advantage of this perk at this time. 

The menu is one page-- there are only about 30 items listed.  The dining area is small, but clean and quaint. 

We were the only customers there (again: it was 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday) and there were two gentleman working, one who said he was the owner and (I guess?) the cook.  They both greeted us warmly and both took turns serving us-- in chatting with them we learned that the special of the day was gnocci, that their sauce and meatballs were \"the best,\" and that they had only opened about 2 weeks ago.

We ordered a Sprite, water, a tossed salad ($4.95), a 7\" Garlic Bread ($3.00), spaghetti and meatballs ($8.75), and rigatoni with tomato sauce ($7.00).  Each pasta dish came with plain bread and butter, but we wanted garlic bread too, we were both craving starches.

The food really hit the spot.  The salad seemed fresh, the pasta dishes were yummy, the bread was good.

The bill came to $27.50 for the two of us.  I tipped 20%, even though we weren't technically served by a server, I wanted to make certain I showed my appreciation.

The only criticisms I have is that I asked for a glass of water and was brought a bottle of water (which I was charged for) and a glass of ice; they don't have any dessert options, and I didn't notice any kids' menu options.

They also offer hoagies and \"thick square\" Sicilian pizzas, I plan to go back and try that the next time I'm in the area and craving pizza.

It's not fine dining.  If you're a foodie who needs ambiance in your restaurant, flair in your service, and/or a lot of pomp and circumstance in the preparation or presentation of your food, you might not enjoy this place. 

If you want a good, well-prepared, reasonably priced, no-frills meal while experiencing some honest, simple, friendly service, you'll be very happy patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"I stopped with a friend remembering how delicious it was when the owner was Italian. He served the best zucchini cakes in the city. His marinara was incredible. Every thing he served was a work of art. He was from Italy. The new owners told me Frank was no longer cooking. Needless to say, the food was less than mediocre. A step above eat& park, but way more expensive. The clencher was the white sliced bread with sprinkled garlic salt. The pasta was overlooked. Two dinners thirty seven fifty, on paper plates and napkins used at a picnic.l hate wasting money on BAD FOOD."}
{"text":"Lets start with the positive as there was a lot.  This is a cute Italian BYOB in a great location on Brookline Boulevard. It is a welcome addition to the neighbor after the closing of the previous Italian restaurant that located this store front.  We made reservations for a Saturday night and were greeted warmly by the owners when we arrived as they were just cleaning up from a large party. The menu is not huge but enough items that everyone will be able to find something.  The prices are very reasonable with entrees from $8-$9 and specials which include a salad from  $13-$14. Our wine bottles were quickly opened and the service the entire night was fantastic.  I love a small local place where you get to meet the owners.  We started off ordering the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer. It was delicious but I was a little put off by the paper plates it was served on.  Also the napkins were what you would buy at Target and have in your own home.  Anyway once I got over that our orders came out quickly. I went with the spaghetti and 2 meatballs which you also could have gotten with penne. Honestly it was not fantastic and a mediocre pasta dish-the sauce was a bit watery.  My fianc√© ordered one of the casseroles and I was expecting something similar to lasagna. Instead it was a bowl of your choice of noodles and meat with a ton of cheese melted on top.  They had way too much cheese on top which was overpowering.  Others in our party ordered a salad and lasagna which got good reviews.  The cork fee was $5 and they were nice enough to let us relax after dinner and enjoy the evening. We were not rushed out which is rare these days!  I really would like to go back and try the Sicilian pizza on the menu.  They do have take-out and another family shared a large pizza and it looked tremendous. It is hard to fine Sicilian style pizza in Pittsburgh.  The place is very small but the owner said it is very kid friendly which is a plus."}
{"text":"The owners are absolutely some of the nicest people I have ever met. Every customer was greeted with a hug or handshake. This mom and pop places is a treasure to the community of Brookline.

Inexpensive good food. The zucchini appetizer was great. The rice balls and eggplant are absolutely home made goodness.  I would recommend trying them.

Excellent place. A hole in the wall gem you don't find often anymore."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite to eat looking for some pasta for take out.  The restaurant is small with about 6 or 7 tables, some for 2 or 3 and a couple for 4. It use to be another restaurant that we had been to once years ago.

Found out it is BYOB for $5.  Yea!

I had the rigatoni with hot sausage and tomato sauce.  The rigatoni was cooked al dente and the hot sausage were very good.  I thought the tomato sauce was OK, could use a little more seasoning for my taste. Received some warm buttered bread with the meal.  We were talking to the owner and he grew up in the neighborhood and had a shop on the Northside but closed that and then found this space.
Will have to stop back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"Ate here this evening with my son and father.  They both had gnocchi and said it was very good with a wonderful tomato sauce.  I had rigatoni with hot sausage.  Sauce was very good,could have drained pasta first, but delicious nonetheless.  Sausage was good.   For an app we had stuffed hot peppers that were to die for.   Only gripe is pop in cans that each of us paid for 2cans each.  Finally a real Italian restaurant in a predominantly Italian neighborhood."}
