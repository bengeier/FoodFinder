{"text":"First time  having a Viet Sub . I love it.  The bread is fresh  and very tasty topping are whole like a celery  stock and a bunch of cilantro.  With some meat . Best part is it  only cost $3.00 This place looks a bit shady  But if you want to try a good  Viet Sub it's a must try."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite. As a vegetarian, my go-to is the tofu sandwich ($2.50), which I think are best enjoyed with some sweet soy sauce and sriracha. What I would recommend, are these packaged, refrigerated, dessert balls made of spices and lemongrass. Forgot what they're called, but as someone whose awareness of Vietnamese food is relegated to bahn mi and pho, they had a complex blend of flavours and fragrances."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, my favorite Banh Mi place. The bread is perfect, it's a bit on the softer side but still has enough of a crunch (personally find other Banh Mi places can be a bit too hard on the teeth). Also I find they are generous with the sauce, which is skimped in other places.  Fillings tasty, and does not have cucumber (perfect for me as cucumber is my enemy). I always get original #1 for $2.50 (whereas most other Banh Mi places are $3 for the standard).  For price and flavor, can't be beat. Also very friendly staff working there taking your order. No frills environment, for takeout really as there isn't really much place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches. I had to try these vietnamese sandwiches everyone talks about....i just had to. Today I had that opportunity. The older lady was very sweet and friendly she asked me to have a seat while she offered me a warn bun that had just come out of the oven. It had meat and sausage and pieces of boiled egg in it and the outer shell looked like steamed raw dough. I also tried the satay chicken with vermicelli and it was delicious  The vietnamese rolls were 5$ for 2 sandwiches making it a good deal for students or someone just looking for a quick snack on a budget. I felt like her warmth left such a good impression on me overall that ill be sure to return whenever on a budget."}
{"text":"Neat little gem in Mississauga's \"Chinatown\". Got the assorted (#1) bahn mi. The pickled radish and carrots are not too sweet which complimented the mayo/lard sandwich sauce and slight hint of fish sauce, the meat cuts are pretty standard in my opinion but the bread is amazing when fresh out of the oven. This is one of the few places that bake heir baguette on the spot. Most bahn mi places their breads are stale which becomes tough and chewy.   Great service as well the guy at the front counter always tempting to sell me more sandwiches eveytime I get there.  Prices are great as well bahn mis range from $2.50 - $3 50"}
{"text":"So after a trip to NYC's Canal Street, I came back to Mississauga determined to find me a good Banh Mi sandwich and a great Vietnamese coffee. This little hidden gem has both. I'm not Vietnamese but if you go to any ethnic restaurant and the majority of the people coming in are of that ethnicity, you know it's passed the taste test....and I was the only non Vietnamese there.  I had the Satay Chicken Banh Mi and a hot Vietnamese coffee and hot dang, it was good. And the cheapest meal you can have anywhere in the GTA.  It's in the Chinese Centre in Mississauga on Dundas East, next to two other Vietnamese places with their names written in their native script....so don't walk into the wrong one!"}
{"text":"RATING FOR BAHN MI ONLY  I really wish I could give this little hole in the wall place a higher rating but I can't.   What brought me into this eatery was the smell of their fresh baked baguettes. I ordered a #2 Bahn Mi with pork roll, bacon and pate for $2.50. The baguette was very skinny which made it too crusty and hard with not enough of the soft, fluffy inside. There wasn't enough veggies to give it that fresh crunch to the sandwich; it was also missing that sweet, vinegary twang from being pickled. There was no fresh jalapeno slices which adds the spice. The mayo was too thick and sweet; they had too much of the salty pate and the meat was meh. The balance of the flavors was just off.  The only thing that would bring me back is to try their other food items because the servers are just great, really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hi fellow foodies I decided to stop by this little shop nestled in the chinese center after reading some of there reviews on there Banh mi sandwiches and since I love Banh mi I had to give this place a try ... It's kinda hard to find this vietnamese shop but well worth it . First the staff is owner operated and run and they are supper friendly and so nice to deal with..customer service was number one in my books ... So I ordered two bang mi sandwiches spicey chicken and there bbq pork , they were so alternative to my order and literally had my sandwiches done in few minutes including custom changes that they were happy to accommodate.  The bread was incredibly fresh crunchy and so tasty the chicken sandwich was perfectly spicey but not overkill just perfect and the bbq pork was just delicous in every way with its blend of fermented veggies and the crispy pork just amazing and the price was the best at $ 2.50 each , I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try banh mi first class food and service at dirt cheap prices for what you get...can't waite till my next visit"}
{"text":"I just came back from Chicago and had the best Vietnamese sandwich ever. So I was craving one when I came home and found this place. The bread was freshly baked. Crispy, soft, and chewy at the same time. Price is cheap! Three dollars for a sandwich. I had the Satay chicken sandwich and it was delicious. Service was great but they only accept cash so go to the ATM before. There were only two seats in the joint so be prepared to eat in your car. I loved the bread so much I bough six olaces for two dollars. He threw in an extra loaf because one looked a little small. Great place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"great place for banh mi! Really great taste and quality. But they recently bumped up their prices :("}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Mississauga I stop by here for a bang mi sandwich. This last visit I had three visits! I love their freshly baked bread and numerous combination if banh mi sandwich. My favorite is no.1 and 4 from experience. They don't pack their sandwich full BUT for $2.50 it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I've lived in Mississauga for 13 years and not discovered this place before.   This is a hidden gem that needs be to known to the entire GTA.  I ordered   BBQ pork (maybe mixed) BBQ chicken Grilled pork   My fav had to be the BBQ chicken. Sooo fuggin delicious!"}
{"text":"Love their bahn mi, especially when their in house bread is coming out of the oven. I like the lemongrass beef the best. I've taken friends here, who now have made it their go to Bahn Mi place. At $3 a bahn mi it's pretty cheap. Don't forget to try the other goodies they've got. There's a hot table at lunch, didn't try it but looks tasty. If you want a caffeine boost go for one of their iced coffees; it'll give you the shakes!"}
{"text":"Yeah it's small but it's $2.50 CAD. The people behind the counter are always so nice to me. It is supposed to just be a snack. BUT since it is so cheap they will encourage you to order more 4 for $10 CAD is what they were telling me...hahah I can do the math. That is not a deal.   It took me trying Banh Mi's all over Queens, NY and Manhattan to realize how much I liked the Banh Mi's in Nguyet Minh Lo Banh Mi. I miss their Banh Mi's right now. Ugh why is it so far? I am having dreams right now of them. I grew to really like them after a few tries. I liked it more and more, the more I ate them. When we were going back to NYC, we made sure we stopped by before we left. We were standing outside waiting for the doors to open..I guess I like it a lot.   I never been to Vietnam but these sandwiches feel like they might be close to what you'll get in Vietnam. The Banh Mi's in NYC are way more expensive which is fine but the Banh Mi sandwiches in NYC do not give me a feeling of Vietnam, what it would be like. I have seen a ton of travel food videos about Vietnam. Banh Mi's from Vietnam look similar to the sandwiches at Nguyet Minh Lo Banh Mi. Could be my imagination but Nguyet Minh Lo Banh Mi makes me feel like I might be ordering from a real Banh Mi stall in Vietnam. It's the experience, the people behind the counter and my imagination that gives this place 5-stars."}
{"text":"I had a BBQ chicken sandwich, it wasn't that great. The price was great though. The service was slow, but they were friendly."}
{"text":"My favourite Banh Mi shop...and Ive tried the famous Nguyen Houng and Banh Mi boys in Toronto. And this is my favourite for the fact that they bake their breads in house daily, which is nice and crisp yet fluffy. 4 large delicous sandwiches for 10$ ...doesnt get much better. The steam bao, spring rolls and cold cuts are also a must try."}
{"text":"hope im writing this review for the right place. im told there are two banh mi joints in the marketplace.anyway for $2.25 a sub I really don't know how they make a profit. this is my banh mi spot that never disappoints. the bread is always fresh crispy and full of all that lovely fake meat, sour radish, carrots, Asian parsley? and smeared with pate and that oily butter of some sort. I grew up on this stuff and love it. it's on my list of best things to eat. its a small place with a few chairs I just pop in to pick up my food. they put the sandwich together real quick. parking is tough but usually if you wait around you can scoop up a spot if not there is plenty of parking around back. bonus they have like a quick version of pho in a small bowl"}
{"text":"Nguyet Minh is the OTHER Vietnamese store at Mississauga Chinese Centre.  While next door Thanh Son Tofu is packed with people lining up for some Vietnamese treats and drinks, it is basically empty in here.   Jumbo fried shrimp cakes as big as my fist looks delicious.  The place does feel really crowded even when it is empty inside.  Freshly Banh Mi made to order and dessert iced (3 colour iced and other varieties) are available to order."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a while and never knew it was called nguyet minh lo banh mi.  they freshly bake their banh mi bread here just like subway...  they have tons of different Vietnamese foods, hot and freshly made ready to eat.  everytime i come here i want to try everything... the deserts are always colorful and very fresh.  you can touch the rice to feel how soft it is.  banh mi is not bad... pho is not bad and all at a very fair good price.  will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Best Assorted Banh Mi I've had in Mississauga! I always buy a huge batch, bring it home and toast it in the oven a little as I like to eat it warm and crispy with a hot coffee. Sooo good!! The bread isn't big and hard like a lot of the other places. It's the perfect ratio to meat/veggie and paté which I really enjoy. More heavy on the sauce compared to other places, but I prefer that! So much tastier. Their Vietnamese Iced Coffee with condensed milk is delicious too! Very creamy tasting. The gentleman that's always there is hilarious and interacts well with customers. I will continue going back for the extremely friendly/fast service and yummy banh mi! :) I haven't tried anything else there, just the assorted banh mi and coffee."}
