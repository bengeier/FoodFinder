{"text":"I can't even begin to articulate how GREAT this place is. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced.

I highly recommend going for breakfast. The biscuits are out of this world. And don't even get me started on the country ham. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Oakhill is also a small family run business and a places where everyone knows each other. Get there early though, they close the grill at 2 pm."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my boss and coworker for lunch and I'm so glad I tried it!  I can't remember ever eating a better tasting Cheeseburger in my life.  The sweet tea was fresh and the fries were delicious as well.

Oakhill is one of those hole in the wall places; they are a restaurant inside of a small gas station.  I love hole in the wall places like this, places that don't look like much, but the food is better than many other restaurants.  Definitely will be eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Just a great little local spot. Best breakfast biscuits around. Pretty damn good wings too."}
{"text":"Rudest employees around! I stopped going to this gas station because the morning cashier was so impolite and had no customer service skills! I recently decided to give it another try almost a year later and in the evening and it seems whoever hires the cashiers there must like rude employees. The night cashier was just as rude as my previous experience. Its worth it to drive a few exits up or down 485 and give my money to bp or 7/11. They obviously train their employees and have nicer facilities anyway! Will not be going back here again ever! and discourage anyone else to."}
