{"text":"what a find on our way to SC from the Charlotte airport.  Easy to get to and good eats!  What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork in the gas house. Make sure to come buy on Thursdays to get some brisket and German chocolate cake. 
Sides on the other Hand need some work most are pre processed."}
{"text":"Had cheeseburgers, fresh cut fries and wings. Delicious!  So good that we got 2 orders of wings to go and a pound of bbq. About 5 minutes off of 85. Easy to get to. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My gosh!! This place is so good!  The wait staff is so friendly and the food is amazing. My husband and I both \"built-a-burger\" and there were so many options. From standard lettuce and tomato to pulled pork and jalape√±o poppers, you can make any kind of burger you want. Plus the burger itself was very flavorful and juicy. Also, they make their own livermush. While livermush is definitely a regional favorite, this is livermush for people who might not like livermush but still close enough for those of us who do!  The food and the people at Ray's are the best!  Don't let the exterior fool you, you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Apps, wings, sides all good.  BBQ was decent but served room temperature.  I guess they cook during the day and place in hold for evening service.  What was really odd was the BBQ sauce.  Inedible, basically vinegar with rosemary.  Rosemary??? Sometimes a good homemade BBQ sauce can make up for any deficiencies in the actual BBQ, but this was bad enough that I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Looking for a great southern barbecue experience, we went here for lunch. They did not have typical foods you would expect, in fact the only typical barbecue food that was available that day was pulled pork. There was no brisket, no turkey, no sausage etc. so we all ordered the pulled pork and it was not very good. I started feeling sick very shortly after lunch as I seldom get sick. 3 days later I am so sick that I can hardly move. I am very sure I got some food borne bacteria from that pork. So don't go here."}
{"text":"I found Ray's while searching for a good bbq restaurant near Crowder Mountain State Park.
Variety of yummy bbq meats served on a hoagie or plated.
The girls who work there are sweethearts.
I dined at Ray's with my family of 6 and it accommodated all of our tastes.
Definitely with a visit."}
{"text":"I was on the road and needed something decent to eat that wasn't a chain restaurant. There wasn't much to offer in Yelp except this place which I actually went off-course for. I was not disappointed. The place is a small dig with great customer service and really good brisket sandwich! The best brisket I've had since Hill Country in NYC. Hill Country's brisket was good because it just melted (99% fat content) in my mouth (but that's about it) but Ray's brisket was better because it had great flavor. I did not need to use the provided sauce because the brisket was already loaded with flavor (not overly salted, not coated with commercial sauce). If I was in the area again, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Don't be fooled by the outer appearance, it's always what's inside that counts.  Come in and seat yourself and get ready for some great BBQ!!  A true southern BBQ joint with all the fried fixins you could want.  I'm picky about my BBQ but the pulled pork, fried okra, hush puppies, and fried squash was really good.  Even the tunes on the jukebox had me tapping my feet."}
{"text":"Large portions for lunch which we didn't expect.   Brisket was a bit dry and the baked beans had more garlic than I like.  Looks it's popular were locals with friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 lb burgers and onion rings. SOOO GOOD!!!  Worth the drive from Statesville"}
{"text":"Prices were good, and the burger was great. Very fewsh. Unfortunately I got it Carolina style with coleslaw and chili. Chili reminded me of Castleburys chili sauce. That, by itself, was enough to knock a 4 or 5 star meal down to 3.  Next time I'll try something different and hopefully will be able to improve my rating."}
{"text":"It's sort of a random hole in the wall in Gastonia but I am glad I stopped by. It was kind of a busy day, service wasn't that great but the food was fantastic. The brisket was smokey, tender, and just slightly charred on the outside in parts and was good by itself. The BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy, and light, keeping things interesting. The coleslaw was okay but nothing terribly memorable, especial in light of the brisket. 

Kinda out of the beaten path from the Interstate and personally not a must-go restaurant, but if I'm hankering for BBQ while I pass through the monotony of NC near Charlotte, I know where I am headed."}
{"text":"Locally owned sit down restaurant, very clean and orderly, prompt service, waitress will ask to make sure you have everything you need. Big tumbler of soda pop, will offer a to go cup if you can't drink it all. Big menu with lots of items to choose from. As nice as it is, I was surprised why the traffic was only 2-3 couples at a time. Two flat screen TV's going on opposite sides of the room. There is a long bar with stools with stout drinks to be had, as well as high table and tall chairs, I didn't count but maybe at least a dozen tables. In addition to BBQ there were salads and many sandwiches. Lots of sides to choose from, we had baked potato, corn on the cob, baked beans and potato salad and all were excellent. I was very pleased with my beans and potato salad and roll as they had good flavor. Perhaps soured cream in potato salad, very tasty. The baked beans were slightly sweet, tangy and had beef brisket piece added. Great food, great service, why aren't more people going there!? There is a short deli case with meats, cheese to take home, looked like you can get custom sliced bacon? Too full for deserts and my wife could only eat half her large dinner plate, can't wait to try them for breakfast and for lunches! Please! Gastonia! support this spot! There are three BBQ sauces, two homemade, molasses, vinegar and Sweet Baby Ray's. For the two baby back rib dinners with two sides each and a roll plus two soda's it was a tad over $30.00.  I moved here around 2009 and just now visited and why didn't I go sooner! Next time try the beef brisket."}
{"text":"Returned for dinner. Ordered baby back ribs after waitress, Alexis, told us the just came off the smoker. As you can see in picture, ribs are huge and done perfectly. Got 5 ribs and 3 different sauces. Homemade molasses based sauce was the best. Slaw was very good and the fries we cooked perfectly. My wife got ribs and chicken with baked potato. She absolutely loved it all. She finished everything, which is unusual for her. Top notch service from Alexis and she remembered us from the only other time we were there. We will be regulars now......"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try because of all the great reviews.  We were expecting a BBQ joint, but this is really just a dive bar.  The food was just OK, I got the smoked wings and they were very crispy almost to the point of burnt.  My husbands brisket sandwich was stuffed full and was very good.  I got the potato salad as my side and it was extremely mayonnaisey, I couldn't finish it because it was so rich.  I wanted to really like this place but for me it was just meh.  My chicken wings also had tiny hairs on them, my husband assured me this is normal for chicken wings but I couldn't eat them after that!  The fried pickles were excellent."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Staff was friendly and informative and portions generous.  Clean and fun decor will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best barbeque I have ever tasted! My second time here and certainly will be a regular stop when in Gastonia. Found the place using Yelp and sure glad I did!"}
{"text":"WHOA MAMA! do yourself a big huge favor and stop here for the best smoked chicken EVUH!
read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try and was absolutely blown away by the 1/2 smoked chicken dinner offering. Menu describes it as slow smoked on the pit smoker parked outside in front and in back of restaurant/store, so decided to give it a try. Usually I go for the brisket or pulled pork but something in that menu description just spoke to me and I'm so glad I listened. Service by Alexis was excellent and the restaurant/deli counter area is very very clean. You cannot go wrong here, highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here with my 3 daughters one is 6 years old who is autistic/adhd and my twin girls are 3. I called before I even walked to get our food they told me 20 mins. Well 20 mins later I called they said the food be ready in 10 more mins. 10 mins later food still not done had to wait another 10 mins. With 3 hungry kids. When I walked in I was not greeted at the door. Nobody spoke to me. I asked for 3 cups of water for my kids I was given that. I was told my total again nobody said hi how are you doing. I got my food and walk to the door nobody said see you back soon or nothing. Even if my kids was crying they was hungry and I was the only mother there with a double stroller. When u walked in everyone else was being served and talked to but not me. Want be wasting another dime here. The fried pickles this time didn't taste as great as the first time I ate here. The French fries didn't have any salt or flavor. The chicken was ok..... the onion rings taste kinda watery. I stood out side in the hot sun waiting and waiting just for the food to not be great. If people not going to treat me or my kids with respect then they want get my money period. I could of cooked the same meal at home and got more flavor oh well off to the next restaurant. And ppl really need to stop staring at single mothers nobody even knew my child was special need bc nobody asked and I didn't tell. It's already hard enough being accepted they last Rome u what to do is be out walking stop to feed ur kids and everyone including the people who work here star at you all rude I mean the people outside greeted me and talked to me and they was leaving"}
{"text":"This is a MUST try! Best BBQ in the Gastonia City limits for sure. Huge delicious burgers, most items are made in house and the beer is always cold.
Home town family owned, why wouldn't you?"}
{"text":"Check this place out!!! Be careful you could miss it.  Very hard to see from the main road.  Very good flavorful food great fall off the bone ribs. The front is a deli.  Have to say when I was there the deli was a little dirty and just scraps left in glass case didn't look good.  Once you are in tiny dinning area the food is great.  We had a new waitress and she forgot about us and then never filled our drinks we finished our food with nothing to drink.  Ugh.  She was not trained well but was nice and apologized. I would go back food is very good"}
{"text":"First BBQ restaurant we tried in town. Great pulled pork with special sauce. Perfect local flavor. Two greasy thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I herd some good things about Ray's but unfortunately it was not happening tonight, we were seated at a table that was still sticky from the last guest, waitress's didn't have a clue what was going on so i asked for a wet rag to clean the table and they gave me one...no menu's or silverware was presented to us so again I asked and did receive...food was mediocre and doused x 2 with liquid smoke, we did take our leftover's home and it made the car smell of liter fluid, great margarita's but after the first order they ran out of margarita mix... Hope they can clean up their act :("}
{"text":"Molly is an angle in every sense of of the word of customer service !!! Ashley & her 2 sweet young budding angels from heaven are blooming flowers !!! 
Yes Yes Yes the food is southern style phenomenal ~ ~ ~ but these wonderful young ladies create a magical dining experience & a life long dining memory !!! Way to go Ladies of Rays Country Smokehouse !!! You are all a 5 Star winning combination !!!  You made Rays Proud & yourselves even more prouder !!! Great job to all of the Rays smokehouse staff & service .... & incredible foods !!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It was recommended by a local, and the vibe was kind of \"local dive,\" which is the sort of place I generally like. But I mostly came for the barbecue. Unfortunately, the place disappointed in a number of ways. It was pretty empty for a lunchtime, but the server still managed to get two people's orders wrong. I tried the smoked wings and a pulled pork sandwich, and maybe I just don't understand the Piedmont style of barbecue, but there was no smoke, very little flavor, and it was noticeably dry. And I had ordered slaw to be part of the sandwich. I guess some folks like this place, maybe I hit it on an off day. I'll keep looking for a great NC barbecue place."}
{"text":"This is a solid BBQ place. Reviews said the ribs fall off the bone and they weren't kidding. I also enjoyed the tangy vinigar based BBQ sauce the owner akes. The best thing by far on my plate was the potato salad. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"The place isn't much to look at and we almost walked out.  Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised by the super friendly staff and scrumptious smoked BBQ. The homemade molasses BBQ sauce was to die for.  The BBQ slaw was coleslaw with a kick.   We tried the pulled pork and ribs and loved them.  Best food we stumbled on to during our trip to NC from WI."}
{"text":"The Pulled Pork sandwich 
The highlight of my sandwich was the bun, I liked the bun and how it was toasted. The pork is pulled, not chopped; you can see that in the picture. However, it was a little on the dry side. Also, it didn't have that hit of smoke that I like. The bark didn't give me that extra ump that some can give.

I decided to experiment a bit with the sauce and the slaws. The sauce looked like a traditional Piedmont style sauce. I took a sip to see. First thing I thought was that I as sipping alcohol. I don't know if this was intentional or not. I poured a little on the meat, really didn't change things. Put some in the white slaw since I like to mix the vinegar sauce with White slaw; still wasn't my thing. Finally but that slaw on part of the sandwich. Still didn't find the right combination.

Their Barbecue slaw is as I stated a Mustard Barbecue Sauce so... I tried that slaw on the sandwich. That was a bit better."}
{"text":"Been coming to this area once a year for the past 8 years and always been dubious about NC BBQ since pulled pork is the most dominant and I'm not a fan of it. On recommendation of a local relative and I'm glad I did.  Walked in the door and immediately started a conversation with the pit master.  He offered me a sample of his 13 spice rub brisket and it was excellent but then he offered me a sample of his Texas rub and I was immediately transported back home. This was my 7th BBQ place on this 3000 mile BBQ crawl and my 76th overall across the U.S.  My mom and dad were with me and she's not a big fan of BBQ but this she absolutely loved, especially the ribs. My dad was ready to go back the next day. Rays would definitely make Texas Monthly's 50 best BBQ places in Texas."}
{"text":"Great food nice place like the decor had the  brisket very good.
The coke slaw was excellent.
Nice staff very friendly and nice.
Not very fast from the time you order till you get it. About 15-20 minutes.
Will definitely go back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"couldn't even give a star because it says rays smokehouse bbq no smoke on that meat 
potato salad was terrible 
1st time I went and I will not be back
had to give 1 star"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hole in the wall BBQ joint, this is definitely a place worth checking out. It's 20 miles outside of Charlotte but worth the drive. I ordered the smoked chicken with potato salad and onion rings. The food was absolutely fantastic. And the price too. A normally BBQ platter will typically cost upwards of $20 but my meal was $11."}
{"text":"First, we are regulars after discovering Rays last summer. The food is good. The staff is friendly and we've enjoyed getting to know folks.  I have a dairy allergy and they've always worked with me. The fried pickles are amazing. The pulled pork was the perfect blend of spices and smoke. The mustard BBQ is awesome and it's Ray's own recipe! It's not fancy here, which is why I love it. This is Carolina BBQ at its best. I'm also told the burgers are simply amazing, especially when Casey makes them! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Hello best burger in town!! Brisket to die for! Anything I have ever eaten was amazing!!! My kids even ask for it. The only down fall eat in take it out and you risk eating the best messy burger in town once the chili soaks in lol"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Rays for our first time yesterday. She ordered the cheeseburger and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. We got our sandwiches , the pork sandwich was huge, the fries were freshly made and piping hot and not the least bit greasy. My wife bit into the cheeseburger and said it was really really good. She gave it a 9. We both tasted the fries and they were awesome!!
The waitresses were nice. Never had to ask for anything. 
Moving to the pork,, I have eaten a lot of pork BBQ in my 57 years and I know what I like. I bit into my pork sandwich and it was really good the meat was fresh the BBQ slaw was awesome. But using the 1-10 scale I'd have to give it a 8 just for the reason of the taste alone , most propane cookers leaves a chemically taste in your mouth which I don't prefer. So this is why I gave it an 8. I saw after walking out the door I noticed there cookers out front and they were propane fired. I can just tell. Other BBQ places in the gaston area use propane and it definitely makes the meat taste different , (chemically) I prefer to cook over wood Or wood pellet cookers. All in all we will go back and dine there again I want to try the cheeseburger or the brisket. They say the brisket is awesome!
We will be back."}
{"text":"Good Service but Im from Houston, Texas and Their wasnt a trace of smoke in the ribs or brisket. The wings had some smoke and they were decent but the ribs and brisket must have been oven cooked and the brisket looked older than Black Pepper! If they were in my state they would be out of business in A month or less. Do not call your food SMOKED and you dont taste any.....Go to Jim N Nicks in charlotte Where they smoke all their meats like we do in Texas....Even golden corral had better barbecue than this place...They dont have a clue about real barbecue!"}
{"text":"I'm struggling to give an honest review because our experience started off a bit shaky. However, after a conversation with the owner's daughter-in-law, I feel a lot better about the experience. We drove 4 hours just to get their burger since it was voted the second best burger in NC. The burgers are ground fresh and they offer almost any topping you could imagine. I ordered mine with cheese, chili, bacon, fried pickles and grilled onions. The chili was cold, but I assumed that was by design until I was told otherwise. Besides that, my burger tasted very good and tender... Next time I would omit the bacon because the Smokey bacon definitely overpowered the rest of the flavors. While enjoying my burger I bit into something hard, and it turns out it was a broken piece of toothpick that was in the patty. We had a hard time getting our waitress to check on us, so I did continue to eat the burger (with caution). My husband also ordered a burger (that's what we came here for). His was pretty good, but he had onion rings on it that were a little overwhelming on such a small burger. We both agree that the burgers would have been better if we could have ordered them cooked any way besides well done. My son's kids meal was pretty good, but a little small for a bigger kid (he's almost 12)."}
{"text":"Love love love Ray's.  Right up the street from my house.  Food homemade and delicious!  I miss Mama Chris's breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way from VA Beach to Atlanta. Driving through on 85 I got on Yelp and plugged in Barbecue restaurants and it popped up. Definitely pleasantly surprised. The place was small,older and bar like but we know not to judge a book by its cover. Being originally from New Orleans some of our best food spots are literally hole in the wall mom & pop type places. Anyhow my husband got the brisket sandwich, I got  the pulled pork sandwich and my daughter got the ribs. All were really good. Her ribs were so smoke infused and flavorful. We all ate on them. The brisket had a peppered bark exterior that was just yumm! My pulled pork sandwich was overflowing with freshly smoked meat. The service was great and waitress was super sweet. We give it an 8.  The only thing we'd change on our sandwiches is having sauce on it. We had to ask for some. Overall good culinary find for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've drove by this place numerous times and never thought to go in and check it out. I've seen rave review from people in a Facebook group I'm in so we decided to tty the other day. We were not dissappinted either! My son order wings and cleaned the bones, he said they had a great flavor. He's picky when it comes to his wings too. My husband ordered the ribs meal and they were fall off the bone tender. He also couldn't get enough of the potato salad. It was fabulous. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was the perfect combination of crunch and not overwhelming with the mayo. I also ordered the onion rings and they were huge! Overall we will definitely be back and are so glad we stopped in to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great food! As far as I could tell, nothing frozen in sight! My burger was one of the best I've had in a while! The owner's son came out and talked with us numerous times to make sure we were happy with everything and gave us wings to try. Can't wait to go back!"}
