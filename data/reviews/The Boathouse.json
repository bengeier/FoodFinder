{"text":"Amazing view. Friendly staff. Outdoor seating goes quickly, but even sitting inside almost every table has an amazing view of the lake."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner today and spent $120 for 3 people including tip. Though very pricy in my opinion the food was quite good. I recommend ordering many appetizers to share and maybe 1 or 2 entrees. We had a quite a LARGE dinner and ordered Crab dip-- very good lots of crab inside the dip, Cheese Curds-- my first time having them and they were very oily (but what can you expect from something deep fried), Coconut shrimp-- Good but overpriced and the sauce it came with was not that good, Lobster Roll-- we got one with fries and one with salad, the roll itself was very large, the bread was delicious, and the lobster was generous. We also got two \"floats\" one pina colada and the one with orange soda. Both were tasty and something new I haven't tried yet. 

The staff were very kind to us and very quick with our food. We had a dog with us and they asked if we wanted a dog bowl for water-- very dog friendly. We sat in the deck with a water view and it was such a nice day. Overall, I believe the food is a bit overpriced but for the view and service it was great! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have travelled the world as cabin crew and thanks to the staff at The Boathouse and their hotel The Edgewater, this is by FAR our best layover. 

The staff is attentive, the prices are amazing, the atmosphere (with that view of Lake Mendota) and food are next-to-none.

I will be sure to tell all my friends, family and co workers about this place!"}
{"text":"Management needs to do something about the traffic parading through the deck interrupting the outdoor dining experience.  In one case a group of drunk boaters loitered in front of our table as they took turns using the rest room inside, some not wearing shoes.  This place has the ambience of a Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"The Boathouse has a captivating view of Lake Mendota. My friend and I had the chicken sandwich, served on a pretzel bun. It was ok
Service was very good. We were so surprised that even with us spending over fifty dollars for lunch they do not validate parking tickets in the Boathouse. There are too many other restaurants in the area that have better food to pay $9.00 to park to eat there. We won't return"}
{"text":"Love Love Love me do, the fish tacos...  The tuna is cooked to rare perfection, the cabbage slaw just the right amount of kick.  I typically would eat 2, but gobbled up all 3 because they were so delicious!  The comp sides were also, well, complimentary and yummy.  

Bonus:

The view of course, breathtaking.  One of the few unobstructed water views while dining in Madison.  Thank you to The Edgewater Hotel for keeping the land planner from placing the parking lot between our outdoor dining and the multi-million dollar water view. 

2nd Bonus:  You can invite your (well behaved) doggy.  How wonderful is that?  This is in a big/small town that does not encourage doggy owners, to be, well, doggy owners...  

3rd Bonus, yes a 3rd.  Mathew, the server.  He was awesome.  He was courteous and attentive, but not hanging at my table 24/7 or trying to brush me out the door...  I even offered my table if he needed it when I was finished dining, but he declined, noting there were still a few open tables...  So I put my feet up and watched the boats sail in and out and in and out.

Lovely.  Can't wait to return.

{"text":"The atmosphere is great, quite and on the water.  The food quality is not worth the prices.  My fish sandwhich was bland and $2.00 extra for a salad of romaine and a few thin red onion slices?, not when the memorial union is down the street."}
{"text":"You're paying for the view.  And the view is spectacular along the shoreline of Lake Mendota.  But don't expect much value after that.  I'm astonished that The Edgewater doesn't do more to entice locals to come downtown, struggle to find parking in the most difficult area of the city to park, then offer no validation of parking if you park in their uber-expensive parking garage...what am I missing?  Is there enough convention business that locals don't matter?  The food and drinks are fine, but not cheap.  Fish fry is tasty, but three little pieces of perch and slaw for $14?  I'm all in favor of paying more for quality food, drink AND location---but The Boathouse isn't really worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, food completely uninspiring and overpriced ($12 for a brat?!).  At least it has a view."}
{"text":"We eight here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We came by boat. They had college-age kids that helped get our boat docked and were very courteous and we were very impressed with them. There is a very small out door seating area, and they told us it would be 45 minutes. We decided to wait on the boat, and it was less than that, probably about 25 minutes. The way they have the seats set up, some people are looking out at the lake, and some at the building. The prices are very high, so you are paying for your view, so if you get stuck in a seat facing the building, that pretty much sucks. The food was good, but the service was very slow. It took way too long to get our food. However, they did comp us the appetizer because of the long wait. One of the people that ordered a hamburger that had bacon on it didn't get the bacon. The actual item on the menu was a bacon burger. So it wasn't that they added it extra. They just didn't put the bacon on them. All that being said, we probably wouldn't go back, which is unfortunate, because there aren't many places to dine on the medicine lakes by boat."}
{"text":"A real shame that this lovely location has such disappointing food.  Fish tacos sitting in a puddle of liquid from fish and salsa.  The burger-lover at our table said his burger was inedible.  Cheese curds came out all glued together--one giant cheese curd amoeba sliding around on a slick of oil in the basket.  Kitchen was out of many things."}
{"text":"In town from Colorado. Gave the Boathouse a try. Bad food, bad service. High prices. Skip it please or you will regret it"}
{"text":"Setting is unbelievable but service is some of the worse I have ever seen. After ordering it took 1 hour and 10 minutes for my wife to get her food. This part is unbelievable!  My wife was served when I was notified that the perch fish fry I ordered was sold out. 70 minutes after I ordered it and after my wife was served. I accepted the cod fish fry and received 2 small pieces (about 6 total bites).  Somehow the fish was over done, dry and not even hot. The couple at the table next to us ordered the perch an hour before I did and was told it was sold out then.  Hard to figure this out. My wife's crab cake sandwich was very good though. The other unbelievable thing is this is a relatively large restaurant. If you have to use the restroom there is a one seat  men's room and a one seat women's room upstairs. I am told there is a larger bathroom either on the 3rd or 5th floor. Like I said the setting is unreal but management needs to figure things out soon."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place, but no view is worth the 1-star experience we had. I hadn't been to any of the new Edgewater restaurants since the big remodel, and after hearing about the great lake-front views that The Boathouse offered, I was excited to give it a try. 

That's where the excitement ends. 

We walked in to check-in with the hostess, who after staring down at a piece of paper for a minute, finally realized there were people in front of her and said \"Oh...how can I help you?\" 

Okay, not a great start, but the weather was great and the view was fantastic, so we took our table outside and first noticed the outrageous prices they're charging for basic menu items. $6 for a Corona Light? $5 for a Bud Light? I hope they realize this is Madison, WI, and there is NO reason domestics should be that expensive. Eventually we were brought water, which was instantly finished in such sweltering heat. Then came time to order; I had the Fish Basket, my friend had the Shrimp and we split the chips and guac for a starter. The chips were average, guac was decent and the salsa was flavorless. Fine. Then, out came our main courses. First problem: Still no silverware or napkins. Even after our appetizer (which was admittedly finger food) there were still no utensils or napkins brought out. We requested them from our waitress, which them took another 5 minutes to finally show up. By this time, my lukewarm fish had cooled off to a nice room temperature, and the hardly-seasoned fries had lost their crisp. My friend's shrimp came without cole slaw or bread (both specified on the menu), and the waitress seemed blissfully unaware that this was a problem, and stated that \"that's how it usually comes out\". Only after she was shown the menu description did she go back to the kitchen to fetch the missing food. 

The food was like something you'd get out of a swimming pool snack bar. Definitely edible, and seemed fully cooked, but NOT worth the $15 price tag. By this point we'd been without water or drink since the appetizer came out, and were only offered a refill after we had finished our meals and were more than ready to get the check and leave as fast as possible. 

As much as I wanted to like this place, it was an awful experience, run by clueless college kids, from start to finish. If what you're after is a great lake-front dining experience, you'd be better suited packing a sandwich to James Madison Park and saving yourself $60 of disappointment."}
{"text":"I visited the \"new Edgewater\" for the first time last night. We gathered with friends in The Boathouse to socialize and listen to other friends playing music.

Really sorry to have to give The Boathouse such a bad review. The location (of course) is stunning, the view is great, the service was good. The facility is lovely, and takes wonderful advantage of the spectacular setting. I have to say, though, that my overriding feeling about the entire evening is: those are THE most uncomfortable chairs I have ever had the misfortune of attempting to sit in. After a period of painful sitting, I elected to simply stand for the remainder of the evening. I don't know exactly what the intent is, but it feels like they don't want people to linger in the bar - which seems weird. I am always on the lookout for new places to meetup with friends, and I now know that I can conclusively cross The Boathouse off my list.

Oh, and NINE DOLLARS for 2.5 hours of night time parking in the hotel ramp??? Won't make that particular mistake again. It was always free before.

Oh, and really, how many darn(!) TVs do you need, when presumably patrons are there for the view. No way of avoiding the cursed things! I HATE that in food service establishments.

Sorry for such a negative review, but facts is facts."}
{"text":"Aside from the view, it's incredibly mediocre. Out of 75% of their appetizers, watched a bartender google how to make a sidecar, went 1 for 5 with taking our food to the right table, and forgot about a salad we ordered. This was all an improvement from last time when we were here and waited 20 minutes at the bar without making eye contact with anybody."}
{"text":"It pains me to write a bad review, but wow. I have never experienced worst service in Madison. The bartender was rude, unhappy, mean. We witnessed her being horrible to a very nice older man at the bar and my husband and I were completely shocked that this behavior was happening. When she \"greeted\" us (as in, turned in our direction and just stared with a mean glare) she was just as rude. After asking two questions and getting the most horrible responses, I eventually said \"Is there another bar at the Edgewater we can get a drink where the service is actually friendly\"? She did not catch on."}
{"text":"We were very excited to visit The Boathouse on such a beautiful Friday evening with friends, as we had heard great things about the new Edgewater Hotel.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations.  We know that has only been open for several weeks, but the staff and management have a long way to go in order for this to become a restaurant I would visit again.

When we walked in to the restaurant, we were told that we would have the next available table outside.  While we waited, we grabbed a drink at the bar.  The inside bar area has a great ambiance with nice, boathouse-like decor.  As we waited, we noticed two groups that arrived after us got seated on the patio.  When we brought up the concern, one of the hostesses told us that she had forgotten us completely, even though we were standing very near the hostess station and our name was first on the list.  Soon after, a party that seemingly had been dining in the upstairs portion of the restaurant (and wanted to switch to the outside) walked up to an empty table on the patio and claimed it.  We watched as another hostess had a brief discussion with the group and then let them stay.  The hostess then proceeded to tell us that the group had taken our table and that it would be ten more minutes before another table opened up.

While waiting, one of our friends ordered a beer at the bar that was barely drinkable because it was the bottom of the barrel.  After discussing this with the bartender, he did end up getting a second beer free of charge.  This was the only act of graciousness we received during the course of the evening.

After finally sitting down, I expressed my concern about waiting so long and being skipped over to our waitress.  She was apologetic and said that she would talk with the hostesses.  We ordered a round of drinks and an appetizer, which were fairly slow to arrive.  The drinks were well made, but the chips and guacamole/salsa were unremarkable and served with only a small condiment-cup size of guac and salsa.

The four of us ordered variations of the fish fry, which was good, but nothing special.  The coleslaw was very plain, fries unseasoned for half of us, and fried fish rather greasy and small.  For $14.00 a basket, we expected a bit more.

The worst part of the evening was that I ordered another drink, and my friend a water, towards the end of the meal.  After ordering, we did not see our waitress again for another half hour.  When I was trying to get anybody's attention to cancel the drink, but our waitress finally brought it out.  I told her that I was just going to cancel it and she apologized and still gave it to me.  We asked for the check, and we were charged the full $8.00 for the last drink that I ended up sucking down quickly because we were ready to leave.

The gorgeous view from the patio was the one great thing about The Boathouse.  I feel that the staff really lacks proper training, and I expected at least some explanation beyond, \"sorry- it's really crazy in there.\"  A free appetizer for the long wait to be seated, or a free drink for the poor service really would have gone a long way.   I worry about what will happen when the pier opens up and it gets even busier!

I want to come back because I think it is a great view of the lake, and it has some good potential.  It just may be awhile."}
{"text":"Went to the Boathouse last evening for the first time.  It was a beautiful day here and we thought it would be fun to eat out on the dock.  The first problem was getting out there.  My husband & I were with his parents and a friend (all in their 80's).  There is no elevator directly from the parking area down to the waterfront.  One of the ladies has a difficult time with stairs so we had to go into the main hotel to the elevator, down 3 levels, then walk through a very long, winding dark tunnel, go down a few more levels and finally arrived at the restaurant. 

Our plan to sit on the dock by the lake was immediately scraped when we went out there and it was over 80 degrees and there was absolutely no shade and they didn't even have umbrellas for the tables.  We went inside to the upper level.  Despite being open for over a year, there was still plywood on the walls and open junction boxes that didn't have the fixtures attached.  The floor, walls and ceilings are all resilient surfaces so it was very noisy and hard to hear even though there were only a few other people in there. 

Now for the menu, the selections were extremely limited.  For an appetizer, can you imagine a can of sardines with a sleeve of Ritz crackers?  The other selections were equally underwhelming - a few appetizers, a couple of salads, soups and sandwiches.  The drink menu was very limited as well.  Only 3 mixed cocktails, beer and mediocre wine.  The best thing I can say is that the servers were very nice, but that's not going to get us rushing back.  After a less than satisfying meal, they charged $15 for parking!  This is Madison, not New York.
If I could give it O stars I would.  I think those giving it 4 or 5 stars must work for the company."}
{"text":"The view is great! The tables and decor are pretty nice. I decided to come back and update my review based on the fact they just opened up and they need to be cut some slack. They definitely need some work on their food preparation and getting their staff more experienced. I don't think I will be returning any time soon to eat but for drinks only I think it's a great spot to view the lake and watch a gorgeous sunset. One thing that really still bothers me is the parking ramp sign advertises parking validation but that is only for special events. Save your money and find a spot on the street."}
{"text":"After finding our way down the unmarked area and finally finding the place we made our way into the bar. Waited 30 minutes for a table outside while we watched other people just go and sit down outside without stopping by the hostess stand.

They need a podium hostess stand outside on busy nights.

Subpar fish that was over priced. Unapologetic slow staff. 

I get they have a great location but at some point you have to put out a good product. 

Won't go back until I hear from others things are changing."}
{"text":"Went on the 4th of July...docked our boat with the help of a very nice attendant, but then it was down hill after that...waited for about 20 minutes for a table, that wasn't bad but after we got seated waited for about 1 1/2 hours for our food , we almost walked out, plus people around us were walking out and complaining.food was not the best...cheese curds so greasy, fish so greasy and got the wrong type of fish, chicken chopped salad came without dressing, chicken salad sandwich  had a very small amount of chicken salad on the bread gazpacho same as the salsa, no different taste... crab cake sandwich also not the best, waitress was good, apologizing that they were so busy and that the kitchen was small!!!  Whatever!! One of our party asked to speak to the manager, was told she didn't see him all day and that he wasn't around...so for the 4th of July and basically the opening of their dock and restaurant the manager wasn't around...you got to be kidding me??? Not acceptable, was given the calling card of the manager, our son called him the same day, and no answer as of yet!! They also designed the bar bad, should of been turned around and that the customers could be looking out onto the lake, plus the outside patio should of been so much larger...with the only restaurant basically on the lake you would of thought that they would of know better!! Don't know if we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointed by the food and drinks here - how is \"Madison's best hotel\" churning out such mediocre food in all of their venues? The only reason to come here is the water-front tables, which provides and beautiful view. The bar is way too high, being a part of the Edgewater, for what is being produced."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the ambiance of The Boathouse at night - dirty tables, slow service, and neon red lighting reminiscent of Kenny Rogers Roasters. It'd be better during the day when you can enjoy the view."}
{"text":"I've stayed at The Edgewater hotel before and it's definitely a great hotel, they should disassociate themselves from this restaurant though... I ordered the Lobster Roll with French fries - the French fries were the star (and they weren't even that great). This lobster roll was the most bland, tasteless, season less, flavorless food I have ever tasted in my life! It was unreal and extremely disappointing.

In other news, the waitress was very friendly and attentive - but I was too shocked by the quality of the food to get her name."}
{"text":"So I've been sort of on hiatus from writing on yelp but The Boat House has forced me to write. I'm going to keep this short out of the pure frustration i have. I expected such a reputable place such as The Edgewater would have wonderful dining at all its restaurants but that is not NEARLY THE CASE. I am a frequent diner to as many restaurants in Madison as i possibly can and this is by far the worst dining experiencei have ever had in Madison... Ever.

The service was extremely slow, it took forever just to get water let alone drinks, the drinks were way over priced, we never got silverware until the food was delivered and when we asked for silverware, it took forever to get a refill on water and drinks, it took forever to finally order food, only saw our server maybe 5 times out of an hour and 1/2 time we spent there, the food cane it with half of what it said on the menu and then the server tried correcting me saying \"that's usually all it comes with\" (i was missing 3 items). The food was spectacularly mediocre, overpriced, and to top it all off there was extremely dirty silverware. I'm not one for one-time reviews but WOW i just can't help myself on this one. Madisonians will quickly learn not to choke here but unfortunately they will still doop the out-of-towners and leave a laying bad taste in their mouths snit Madison.

Simply: terrible"}
{"text":"5 stars for the view, 2 for service. My husband and I came here for drinks after eating dinner elsewhere. The decor is tasteful and nice, it seems like a great place to hang out. The service though was just ridiculous. The host seemed quite rude in that I would expect him to be a little more pleasing and welcoming. Whenever he came to our table to do something like give us menus or deliver food (which he shouldn't have been doing anyway) it seemed like it was beneath him. The servers were nice but we never knew which one was ours. I think we dealt with three different servers.  It was amateur hour over there. I think they just have some kinks to work out still. Hopefully they'll get it together soon, I'm sure plenty of people will want to come check it out. Seems like typical Wisconsin fare which I think people here will appreciate. They honestly could have made it more hip but it is a hotel restaurant I guess. The view more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Lunch on Tuesday, June 9th, was a pleasant surprise. The weather was perfect for dining on the deck overlooking the lake and new pier now being constructed.

A good selection of well prepared sandwiches is offered at reasonable prices. I enjoyed the perch sandwich which was grilled to perfection. My friend enjoyed the chicken salad and also heartily recommends that. Despite being quite slow by 2PM, we received excellent service too."}
{"text":"Horrific service from out of town called for reservations and told they didn't accept them. Arrived at restaurant and asked for a window seat. We were escorted upstairs and sat in two different booths on the back wall with all of the tables next to window vacant. Only one table occupied on the whole floor. Terrible hostess. Took over 15 minutes before we ordered drinks.  Waited another 10 minutes and went to ask for our drinks a different server brought drinks but couldn't take an order. Oh and the no reservations? They reserved three tables while we were there?  Hmmm  it's been 45 minutes since the order no drink refills guess that is extra.  Food and view was ruined due to  the terrible service.  Been here for an hour and a half guess we will go down the road for something to wash this terrible experience away!  One star for the view."}
{"text":"The place has a spectacular view of the lake. It is a good place to gather to have drinks and enjoy the view. That's where I would leave it. I had the cod and it was over fried (actually brown color) and the cod was lost. The malt and vinegar chips are addictive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before an event. 5 pm on Thursday, it was sparsely populated. Not a good sign. The wait staff stood around chit chatting while the bar staff seemed only interested in amusing themselves. Service was inattentive and slow. Also mentioned in a previous review the manager seemed anchored at the bar clowning with the bartenders. I don't mind pay a few extra bucks for a drink and food with a view like this but when the service is crappy. I'll take my dollars elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio area is lovely and seating is comfortable.  Even the view, which included construction of the dock at present, is very pleasant.  My husband and I had a glass of wine, which was decent, along with guacamale and chips on a recent afternoon.  The guac and pico de gallo served with it were very bland--both needed some spice like cilantro and chili--but not overly salty, a good thing.  Service was good.  Our experience overall was thoroughly enjoyable.  Once the docks are ready, the snacks are tweaked and summer arrives, The Boathouse will be a great place to spend some time with friends."}
{"text":"We visited the Boathouse with a group of 11 people for lunch on Sunday early afternoon.  We called in advance and were told they did not take reservations.  When we arrived and were being seated we asked to be seated near the window and they told us those tables were reserved!?!.  We had to help the sever push other tables together to accommodate our group.  The food and views were good.  The service was slow.  We had to ask for refills on our soft drinks and at least three of the food orders were incorrect where the sides were wrong.  Overall the place is very underwhelming given the reputation of the hotel."}
{"text":"The food is Ok for high end bar food. Very noisy and hard to have a conversation. Our two tables were very wobbly. Also, plastic wine and drink glasses?"}
{"text":"Can't beat the view but food and service was disappointing. Biggest disappointment was the lack of changing table in the women's restroom (assuming none in the men's!). Come on - if you have a kids menu, you can't have a changing table in the ladies room?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place was going to be good since we do boat and it is on the lake.  But the food was over priced and flavorless. Our crab Dip came out cold and seemed to be imitation crab meat. The Lobster roll bun was stale and might of had 2 pieces of actual lobster on it.  Oh and did I mention flavorless.  The atmosphere could be great but the space was very echoey and we could not hear each other at the table. The server never came back to check in with us And since we were starving my husband still ate. 
The bathroom was not maintained.  
Come for drinks but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice casual place right on the water with a great view of the lake.

Stopped here for lunch on Friday and found it sparsely populated.

Waitress was friendly and helpful.

Had a brat and beer which did the trick.

Experience was fine for me.  I see lots of haters on here, but I had a very pleasant lunch, decent food, good service, and of course the spectacular location and view.

Would come back."}
{"text":"Everything but cheese curds and lake view were lacking...the service was disconnected and slow and food mediocre. For this caliber of location and price, I expected more.  Chips were chewy, salad soggy, and the lobster roll laughable...granted we're land locked. Next to the restaurant's peaceful patio, frat boys attempted to use a power drill to repair their dock, demanding our attention. If you seek good lake views, this could be worth a drink (maybe an appetizer), but otherwise, save your money for a legit foodie place on the square."}
{"text":"First stop in Madison to grab a quick bite at the hotel and the view was totally worth it!  The restaurant itself was nothing to write home about, but overall it was a good experience. 

the staff was very friendly which I'm a big fan of. It was a gorgeous afternoon and perfect time to arrive and get a seat outside on the water (3pm-ish) to enjoy the end of the season's sun! Good variety of music, nothing nautical based, which I do love listening to when I'm eating and drinking outside on the water in the summer, but that's not for everyone..

I got the Louis salad with fresh shrimp and crab meat. Light, refreshing, and perfect to hold me over..(for now). I also enjoyed a Leinenkugel's Octoberfest..trying to ease into the fall..

Overall, it was a good first impression of Madison! 

Thank you!
Lindsey"}
{"text":"Seriously people...online reviews can be devastating to a new business so a little thoughtfulness and understanding goes a long way.   You can CLEARLY see the crane that is building the 125 ft pier from across the lake...The Boathouse has been open for just a bit over a week so there will be hiccups as they get up to speed.  I hate poor service as much as the next person so I understand that review, but it's a brand new staff so I am sure she will work her way right out the door.  

My wife and I discovered the bar/restaurant the same weekend it opened.  We have gone back since because of the great atmosphere, the fun and friendly bar staff, and the Old Bay Fries...the fries are to die for and a great appetizer for only $4.  There are too few places to enjoy a drink and a view of our beautiful lakes in Madison so I for one am thrilled with the Boathouse."}
{"text":"I don't know what the others are talking about !! Our Servers where Great !! Drinks Where Great, its tough to make a Great Brandy Old Fashioned and they did !! Food Quality was Great and timely.
I was turned off because Parking is not validated. Thats kind of crappy for the amount of the dinner bill."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, seems to have nice ingredients. The location is perfect for boats but other than that it is not a super accessible locale. I got the chicken BLT which was delicious. It was on a famous spicy cheese bread from Stella's bakery. The chicken was pretty decent and the bacon was standard. Overall pretty good place but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Expected to sit outside on the deck for a Friday night early dinner.  They don't take reservations and the rather small outdoor seating is completely taken by happy hour guests who take up prime seating for hours with one drink.  The beautiful view is inhibited by the poor window design with steel framing right at eye level for all the couples we were with.  The acoustics were SO LOUD we were screaming the entire time and had headaches when we left.  Just a little fabric on the ceilings and walls would take care of that! The service wasn't great, but the servers were running up and down stairs the entire time.  When I asked for plates after she brought our appetizers I was told, \"I'll see if I can find some\" and she never returned with any.  We were forced to eat with plastic utensils,,,,,,really?  The food wasn't spectacular with the exception of the cheese curds.  I was extremely disappointed to learn that the fried oyster po'boys they had on their website menu were no longer an option because \"oh that menu is really old\" and the waitress looked at me like I was the idiot (like when I asked for appetizer plates).  Shouldn't your website menu be up-to-date?  So much potential, so much disappointment.  Our party agreed never to go back."}
{"text":"Service: A+
Food: A+
Drinks: A+
View: A+

Stayed at The Edgewater for a night and couldn't leave without having a meal on the patio of The Boathouse. We got there right when it opened at 11am, and people started piling in immediately. Our waiter Ryan was so friendly and spot on with all of his recommendations!! 

What I recommend: 
- Clock Shadow Cheese Curds: These are as good as it gets! I went to school in Milwaukee, so I know good cheese curds & these are unbelievable. The chili ranch they're served with is so awesome! Definitely an appetizer to share with 2-3 people. 
- Clam Chowder: So pleasantly surprised by how amazing this was. I never order clam chowder unless I'm on a coast, but this was phenomenal. With little chunks of bacon, and a small bacon strip on top, it was a delicious midwestern fresh-tasting chowdah. 
- Bloody Mary (X-tra Spicy): Bloodys are always hit-or-miss, but I asked for mine with Tito's and extra spicy... and boy did they deliver!! It wasn't too sweet, or too strong or too salty. It was perfect. t would order this again and again. 
- Stella's Chicken Sandwich: My boyfriend is a chicken sandwich fanatic and we ordered this strictly because we were told we needed to try Stella's spicy cheddar bun while we're in Madison. The herb aoili, the heirloom tomatoes, the fresh arugula... it was so big & tasty! 

Very affordable and definitely worth the delicious food, drinks and view!! It's open to guests at the Edgewater and the public. Don't miss this gem tucked away along Lake Mendota."}
{"text":"My earlier review started with a yawn but this time, it's more like tears streaming down my face.  How can a venue with a great view be absolutely terrible with both service and food?  It starts with my girlfriend waiting at the bar to order a drink while 7 staff members just sit there and never ask if she needs anything.  Evidently, some were being cut for the evening and this led to internal conversations but at the end, there is no excuse for such shabby service-it was like she was invisible.  Hoping for a better meal, we ordered cheese curds, crab cake sandwich, and fish tacos.  The cheese curds were fairly on the greasy side (most likely due to oil not being at the right temperature) but the cheese inside had the right amount of gooeyness to overlook it.  I was disappointed with my crab cake decision.  Heavy on the filler, the flavor was flat.  Nestled in a bun, it was like eating a stuffing sandwich.  At $18, it is a head scratcher as they quality of crab (backfin) as well as the quantity used (vs. cheap fillers) doesn't warrant the price point.  The tacos my girlfriend ordered didn't fare much better.  Three tacos with scant amounts of fish and some toppings that also lacked flavor.  Advertised as tilapia, the fish was in chunks which makes me question what type of fish it really was.  One taco contained a singular chunk that was a size of a half dollar.  Just puzzling how someone it the kitchen would think to put that out.
It's a shame that the Boathouse can't get it right.  There are very few places on Lake Mendota where you can sit lakeside for a dinner.  The view can't be beat but the extremely poor service and the overpriced and subpar food prevents us from coming back."}
{"text":"The most beautifully situated shit show of all time. Staff cannot figure out what is going on no matter how many people are working. Endless confusion, inexperience and lack of decorum. Good cheese curds, though. And beautiful sunsets.

Just waited over an hour and the buzzer never buzzed. Trying to close my tab but a bartender who seriously must be stoned to the bejeezus is ignoring me. Thing is I think they don't care about reviews, honestly, because it's always plenty busy with their captive tourist and boater audience."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see the Edgewater brought back lakeside casual dining, until we went there. You have to REALLY want to go there, unless you arrive by boat at the nice pier. Multiple flights of steep stairs are not for the timid or feeble. Once the host seated us, we waited 15 minutes for a server, finally got our own drinks and ask the harried host to find us a server. Our light meal arrived promptly and earned the second star. At the end of our meal we asked for a box for our residual chips. They had to send a runner to the main restaurant for a box! The bill for chips/salsa, a salad and a sandwich; $27. Parking in the remote ramp $6. Leaving, we asked how to avoid the stairs. It took 2 elevator rides and a long hike to get back to the main lobby. Leave gramps and the walker at home!"}
{"text":"This place just opened recently and my friends and I wanted to try it out. It was going to be about a 20 minute wait for outside so we decided to sit inside. We still got a great table with a great view (see pics). 

The hostess sat us down and we waited a solid 7 minutes before our server got our drink order. We ordered our drinks and dinner worrying that if we didn't, it might take a while. 

We ordered cheese curds for our appetizer. They were delicious, especially with the spicy mayo.

I ordered the Boathouse Brat with fries. It came out hot and the fries were especially good. The fried onions for some reason tasted soapy. The brat itself was delicious and the large pickle it came with on the side was crunchy. 

Overall, we had a good experience. My friends ordered the Waldorf Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Boathouse Burger. They both said it was good."}
{"text":"Sorry Boathouse, Fried Perch was really bad.  Someone call Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"The waterfront view is the best thing going here, and the only thing that pushed my review to the 3rd star. 
Portions are small and the menu is fairly limited. Caesar salad drenched in dressing, and small for the price. Cheese curds were not good, which isn't going to win them many fans. Overall fairly disappointing."}
{"text":"Don't go. Don't go to this place. I have lived next door to the edgewater for three years and all components continue to disappoint, but none more than the boathouse. I have been down here a few times over the years because it's close to my apartment and it's a nice place to sit, but the most recent time was the last. The service is consistently awful, the food is mediocre at best and clearly from some mass-distribution source, and they charge out the ass for it. Last time I went, I paid $14 for a fish sandwich slightly larger and about the same quality as a McDonald's fish sandwich and chips. My boyfriend got basic chips and guac (clearly out of a bag/jar) and they charged $12. We both got possibly the worst Bloody Mary's ever which came served in shorty glasses (half sized). Bottom line - don't reward the boathouse and the edgewater for doing a crappy job at ridiculous prices. Don't go."}
{"text":"Terrible menu.  No decent choices, and even in the small menu they didn't have 2 of the 3 kinds of fish.  Iceberg lettuce salad and thousand island dressing"}
{"text":"Despite my previous bad experience, I have been here two more times. I keep getting stuck here because we have entertained guests and they want to to somewhere by boat and try the \"new\" boathouse. Plus, we have a gift card. I have never ordered anything here that I would order again and the service is so spacey it is actually entertaining. 

The second most recent experience was Labor day and we were actually seated without the run around. The server was clueless (but nice) and forgot some of the most basic requirements like silverware and napkins. The coconut shrimp appetizer was interesting but really really sweet. Undecided on that one. 

We went again yesterday (Cap Bills was closed and Nauti and Mariners were brunch only). The Packers game was on so they didn't even play their usual \"at least 30 minutes\" game to sit outside. Despite the fact that they were empty, things were really slow. Grapefruit margarita was pretty good...but it should be for $10. I got the \"Blackened\" fish tacos with fruit salsa. I was served 3 dry tortillas with dry shredded unseasoned fish that was room temperature at best. The salsa was a sprinkling of pineapple. I ate it but I don't know why. The wife's breaded shrimp basket was OK but she kept searching for the shrimp in the breading. The breading was unexpectedly sweet again like the coconut version. 

I am honestly glad our gift card has been depleted! I have never seen a place with so much potential be so disappointing. The bluegill in the fish tank are pretty cool."}
{"text":"Spectacular setting, terrible service and food.  For the prices they charge I would expect so much more.  Plastic cups and College kids running the place doesn't cut it.  Much work to do.   Oh - and $15 to park!"}
{"text":"Nope. Nope. No.... Nope. Hey Edgewater you are so so so lucky you are on the water. You should shut your place down and sell it to food fight restaurants so they can make this a place worth going to.... 

Took 45 minutes to get chips and salsa. Took 1:25 minutes to get our food. There was 6 of us and NOT ONE person got the correct thing they ordered.... All the Edgewater restaurants are so sub par. It hurts my head to think how you can not see how poorly run these places are. 

The worst part is the management said none of it was their fault...."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  It's one of the very few places to eat on the lake.  But this is about the 7th time I've been and as usual the service is horrendous and the food is subpar. 
Got there last night at about 9:10 - ordered right away, she brought our drinks, then didn't come back to check on us for about 40 min. When she did she told us our orders were almost ready and she would bring them right out. We pointed out that it had been really long and she apologized and said again it would be right out - 30 min later (!) our food came. (Mahi Mahi tacos with really nothing on them but some cabbage - no sauce - not worth the wait or the cost).  She again apologized, told us our meals were no charge - and that it was some computer screw up. 
Why can't we have a place on the lake that has good food and good serivce!? This is at the Edgewater?? I don't understand why this place is as bad as it is???"}
{"text":"Great view, terrible everything else. On an uncrowded night I failed to make eye contact with a bartender for 20 minutes while listening to them fight with each other and tell others that they \"can't find beer glasses.\" Another time I sat at a table outside for 20 minutes before our waitress greeted us."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about the food, but the WI beer selection is great. Really it is all about the view. it is amazing at lake level with a dock you can pull your boat up to. The prices were reasonable and the service was quick and friendly. A place to just sit and chill looking at the beautiful lake. The atmosphere was very chill considering it is in the Edgewater it is a relief. The rest of the place is beautiful, but very upscale. I can see it getting extremely busy in the summer season."}
{"text":"It pains me to give a bad review but I'm afraid I must for The Boathouse. 

My wife and I have come here a few times when wanting to have a nice chill lunch on the water. Madison's weird because we've got these big huge lakes in the middle of town and yet the lakefronts are badly developed with not much along them. So we'll be like, \"oh yeah let's go to that bar at The Edgewater, it's at a nice spot on the lake,\" which is in fact true.

BUT... it's so friggin expensive for what you get.

Today we spent $60 + tip on a lunch that consisted of two sandwiches and three drinks. This included $7 for a Potosi beer and something like a $2 upcharge just because my wife wanted a little side salad with her sandwich instead of fries.

To add insult to injury it was another $6 for parking because the ramp charges $3/hour, we were there for maybe an hour and a half, and they don't validate. All told, this became a $76 lunch.

The food was decent to maybe above average, and our server did a good job, but I'm sorry, the price is just too high.

Now look, I'm willing and able to spend that much or more on a meal if I think it's worth it, and I get it, to some extent that you're paying for eating on the water. But for these prices, the experience needs improvement. While the space is very nice to look at, they don't have umbrellas over the tables, the chairs are uncomfortable, and the armrests are too high to fit under the tables, which prevents you from getting close enough to your food. You have to sit up on the edge of your seat and lean forward. I don't think it's too much to ask for a chair that fits with the table.

The Edgewater has tons of potential but I can't help but feel a bit swindled after my experience today."}
{"text":"One star is to many. Fish was dry and gross! No umbrella on deck for sun protection on patio. Zero value for the price!"}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant is AMAZING! Great food, great service and spectacular views. This place is a must when visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Lobster roll had excess mayo, bun was cold and because of that it was tougher than necessary. The lobster sandwich came with lettuce which is not customary, served as filler and I found it off putting. In addition, no one at the table really found the lobster to be fresh tasting and we voluntarily left the sandwich unfinished. Also, the chips served with my sandwich were little more than crumbs from the bottom of the bag. (Beware, they are malt vinegar and I was doubly dissatisfied upon discovering this.) The cheese curds were good, not the best I ever had but solidly good, the crab dip was neither hot nor cold and the calamari were all rings, properly cooked but also quite salty."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Long wait times and the bartenders are agonizingly inexperienced and slow. After waiting 20 minutes for a drink, our bartender slammed our change down on the bar in frustration. There are too many other options in Madison."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating the opening of the new Boathouse restaurant and bar and The Edgewater since winter and it's finally here (official opening is a week out)!!!  I attended a \"sneak peek\" event last night and it lives up to the expectations!  The Boathouse's two-story space feels like you are on vacation in Florida.  Interiors are nautical and casual while still classy.  The views to the lake from the second floor are outstanding!  The piers don't go in until mid to late June, but will be well worth the wait!  The main bar is on the first floor (ground level) and bigger than the previous one.  The food was fantastic as well...we had crab cakes, phenomenal shrimp cocktail, chips and guacamole, and clam chowder which was all delicious and will surely be even better when served on the pier with a cocktail in hand! 

A very welcome and fabulous upgrade to the lake...bring on summer!"}
