{"text":"It's just a good show. Instead of trying to make everything visually fancy, try to improve your food taste. Good place. Nice environment. Friendly staff. We paid $60 per person. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I went there for their famous beef soup noodle. Totally not worth the price. The soup base, the noodle are both below standard. Only the 2 pieces of seared beef slice are tasty. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Got the full tasting menu.

Salad = comes in five vials where you pour the ingredients in then shake it, was pretty good but not that spcial in terms of ingredients. 

Signature beef noodles and soup bland and tasteless, Not good taiwanese beef noodles.

The pork belly with different sauces was pretty good, but very small portions.

Abalone definitely it was brings the price up, but it was good.

Most of the items seemed to be okay... then the \"Bao\" came. If youve ever had taiwanese bao you would be embarassed to see what was served here. Literally a cut of white WONDERBREAD with some ground pork and lettuce! This is not fusion, its a disgrace. 

Service and decor were good, but I would not recommend this place or come back if you want to try real taiwanese foods."}
{"text":"We ordered beef fried rice teppanyaki and spicy beef tossed noodle. The teppanyaki is similar to AKA, but I would say the latter is better. The sauce that comes with the teppanyaki is too plain; I used about half the bottled to feel like there is some seasoning for the dish. The spicy beef tossed is delicious. However, the noodle does not feel like it is freshly made (it feels like ready made noodle that you can get from the grocery stores). The waitresses are still inexperienced but given that the restaurant is recently opened, that is forgivable. When we were there, the waitresses interrupted us too many times which felt a bit annoying. Overall, I would say I expect more for the price."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant that just opened, truly something different in the Annex. The dishes are unique and the tasting menu is well worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was not even worth one star. Me and my friends ordered five different plates but none of them were worth its cost.
Their signiture beef noodle had no flavor in their soup, noodles were not even well cooked. Don't know why it costs 25$.
Fried beef teppan did not even seem to have beef in it.
Spicy beef noodle used the same noodle as their signiture beef noodle and only thing I could see was hot pepper and thai chili. I don't know which spice they used but I couldn't bear with its smell. At last my friend said he could not taste anything because the chinese spice they used made his tongue numb. 
Stewed beef noodle also did not taste like anything.
Lastly, chicken teppan with curry was the most edible because it tasted just like ordinary curry. However, still don't think it worths 16-17$.
Didn't really enjoyed the time here. I really don't recommend their plates while you are still paying average 20$ for tour meal. Don't worth money."}
{"text":"Tried their selected tasting menu with my wife and friends. The experience is amazing! Food tastes good, we really liked the appetizer platter. Strawberry cider is a little too sweet but their house special apple cider is very good! Also it was presented in a pretty container, was very creative. For mains, we both had flaming bull's signature noodle and we liked it. Dessert was the Chinese traditional tremella mushroom soup, also presented in a beautiful plate, and tasted refreshing too. In the end we really enjoyed dining at the flaming bull and would definitely come back again to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the window decor! This is a place that declares itself fine dining but used cheap ingredients. The lunch specials are a no-no. My partner got the fried pork noodles and it seemed like he was served ground pork on instant noodles. Lunch comes with salad and pop but there wasn't any diet pop. I got the Sichuan chicken tacos which tasted like tuna salad with slivers of Sichuan chilis on it. A very mediocre lunch your kid could make. 

We went for lunch on Christmas Eve and the music was too loud so we switched seats, but it remained loud. It was insufferable auto-tuned Jingle bells on acid. We asked them to turn it down a bit but it remained loud, probably because there was no upholstery to absorb the reverberations and only one other table was in there."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist to Toronto, but if I lived here, I would be a regular at the Flaming Bull. It was a pure delight. 

We ordered three appetizers - the mango salad, the Taste of Life pork shoulder, and the bean paste pancakes - and the pork over noodles, plus the mango ricotta for dessert. Everything was divine. 

My particular favorites were the bean paste pancakes (served piping hot in a crispy yet flaky fried dough), but I also have a weakness for bean paste. The noodles were also excellent: thick udon with minced pork pieces and crispy rice noodles and carrots and delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Nice way to put it would be, lots of room to improve. It's pretty much a one time restaurant. This is a franchise or chain store from Taiwan that doesn't seem to be up to par, with it's origin. Entrance is small due to it's \"special design\" therefore limiting the amount of room available for people to wait before their seating. The overall interior design is very nice, it supports their up selling purpose. At the very start, no host available at the entrance to greet. During the long wait for seating, random servers just walk up to you and remind you thats there is no seat available yet, great! Thanks for informing me about the bad news! Coat check is available but no one will offer it to you. The tea was served cold and taste very much like ??? steeped tea. \"A\" for effort in making their dishes visually appealing, however the taste you would expect does not compare up to the price. Its like repackaged T&T cafeteria food. The waitresses are unexperienced, dropped food or spilled stuff on the table every time they deliver or remove dishes from the table. The timing of dish delivery is horrible, absolutely no system involved. You receive your food when they feel like preparing it. So you're all eating a different course at a different time. Its a nice to try once, but don't think you need to ever return. Props to the amazing service team! One star for the design and one star for the effort."}
{"text":"Flaming Bull originated from Taichung, Taiwan, specializing in blow torched beef, found in various types of noodles. In Taiwan, they are categorized as creative cuisine. 

My friend and I, both Taiwanese, wanted to try their signature beef noodle today so we went to the Annex for lunch.  

As much as we are aware that cost is much higher here, the pricing of all the items are basically double what you would pay in their Taiwan location. The menu is practically identical, so is their interior design.

We ordered a small set ($38), it comes with traditional tea, appetizers (pork, beef and tofu), choice of main course noodle/rice (we chose signature beef noodle), dessert (mango pina colada) and a soda (strawberry). We also ordered a separate dish: Spicy beef noodle without soup ($15)

The spicy dish was flavourful, really spicy if you decide to eat the chili. The portion is smaller than a typical noodle dish you'd find in asian restaurants.

The set was a bit disappointing. 
1) Tea was not hot enough (barely lukewarm)
2) Display of appetizers is french-influenced, but food itself was really mediocre.
3) The beef noodle had really tasteful blow torched beef (the flame it on the spot), and the braised beef was great. Noodle was like...mini-portion.
4) The dessert was not exciting...
5) The soda was too sweet.

The waitresses were friendly but seems to still be learning.  If the owner ever gets to read this, you may want to either lower the pricing or increase the portions. 

The food was really just okay, definitely can't justify a return trip for the price point unfortunately :( 

(Giving it 3 stars for the decor and service, would probably give it just 2.5 for the food and its price point)"}
{"text":"Came here for their new lunch special. $13.99 for a main dish and appetizers. If you're a student, you can show your student ID to get a free dessert with the special.

Appetizers are traditional cold dishes, with two types of salads and marinated beef.

I got the salmon fried rice main dish, which comes with a sweet-spicy sauce to mix in. The quality of food is very good for the price.

The dessert is a panna cotta with a mango-flavoured sauce. Pretty good."}
{"text":"The Flaming Bull is interesting.

There are elements I thoroughly enjoyed and I can appreciate their ambitious, different approach to fine-dining Asian cuisine. The ambition however, comes at a higher cost and being in the Annex, it's a bit much to ask for a bowl of anything for over $20. 

So for a 7 Course tasting menu to be available in the neighbourhood, is already a stretch, and to price it at $66, it becomes a challenge. Not to say that the value is completely off for the price, but just a hard sell. 

You see, I enjoyed the table-side mixing for the salmon fried rice and the mini blow-torch show for the side of prime rib beef in my noodle soup. I also liked the beautiful plating, drink pairings and the idea of courses for this type of food. The service felt one-on-one, a server per person, and I had non-stop refills, timed courses, and perfect waiting. 

What I have a hard time with is the justification for shelving $$$ for casual dishes, elevated in presentation but not necessarily flavour or taste. Abalone in my soup? Yes, all day, I'll take that- and torched prime rib was melt-in my mouth delicious. Ultimately, I've had better beef noodle soup, I've had better salad, and I've had better tasting fried rice. The nice, luxurious extras, sides and interactivity add to the experience which is what I appreciated. This stuff is a bit hard to come by in Downtown Toronto and although I think things can be improved, it's still an experience to be had.  

This place is still pretty new and I know it takes time to get in the groove. So I'll return sometime because I have hope. I respect what they are trying to do, their ambition and cuisine. To me, that's sometimes more than striking gold with a re-hashed concept."}
{"text":"Came here for the grand opening for the restaurant. Really enjoyed the time here.
Upscale ambience, the owner must pay lots attention to details, as both decorates and 
food (containers) embraces Taiwan/Asian elements, really like it.

Total was around 8 courses, and they have special names like 'taste of life', 'Ruby', 'Shake N Shake', interestingly reminds me of Michelin restaurant experience. Each course served with ornate dinnerware and for 'Shake N Shake', they even give us measuring tools to 'fine tune' the taste of salad with precise amount of dressings. Bravo!

The main course AAA prime steak is awesome. I like premium beef, instead of traditional Chinese restaurant putting heavy sauces and you cant really tell what's the quality of meet. They can totally serve it without noodle. 

The experience is like food & chill in a tea house. Great for a long catch up with an old friend, a family re-union, or a date. 

At very end, you should not miss Mango Panna Cotta :)"}
{"text":"All in all, I really liked this place. I had no expectations coming in, didn't know that it was a popular  restaurant from taiwan. Once you get past the gimmick of the shake shake salad and rainbow sauce pork belly, there's actually a broad spectrum of  taiwanese cuisines and  reasonably priced dishes to choose from, to share family style or to even order if you are dining alone. I came here with my husband and his colleague, we tried the tasting menu and it has four appetizers,  two drinks, one main ,one side dish, two desserts which I think is pretty good for 60 bucks.  The menu was clear and beautifully photographed and the food we got mostly looked liked the photos in the menu.  My favorite was the signature beef noodle soup cause I'm a meat lover. It has two kinds of beef in it, grilled and slow braised.  I thought the price of this was quite reasonable for the size it s hard to capture how huge this bowl was in the photo i d say you'd have to hold it with two hands"}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to come here on a day off after seeing all these pretty pics on instagram for their signature dishes with paint strokes and zen-like ambiance. Settled for their lunch combo since it seemed like a good deal

LUNCH SPECIAL  ~$13.99  appetizer + main course

Taiwanese appetizer platter - braised beef shank, bean curds, iceberg lettuce salad
This combination is really unique and the cold dish was more on the traditional side of Taiwanese cuisine. Even though it didn't look that appetizing, I really liked it. The texture of the shank, as well as the taste of the salad dressing was superb.

Salmon Fried Rice Teppanyaki (main course) - rice, mushrooms, red peppers, salmon, broccoli, corn, green onion in a sizzling teppan
The waitress mixed the rice and shredded the salmon pieces infront of us, and ended up reforming it into an appetizing mound of fried rice, which was really cool. I'm used to having gravy with teppan dishes but I liked how they used this light tangy sweet sauce instead that I've never tried before.Really loved the mushroom and salmon combination. Really happy with this dish! :D

DESSERT

Panna Cotta ~$6 (but it was free - see below)- mango panna cotta, mango syrup, candied cranberry, candied mango 
Fancy presentation, light panna cotta.. though the pool of mango syrup was too sweet. I was told you're not supposed to drink it lol.. loved it otherwise

DRINKS: - pricey but i think peach perfect is worth it

Peach Perfect Cocktail ~$7.50 - rum, peach juice, fresh peach, blueberry, soda
Spiked. Peach. Slushie. 'Nuff Said. JUST GET IT IT'S GOOD  I'm craving it just thinking about it again QQ

Traffic Light ~$7 - rum, strawberry juice, fresh strawberry, kiwi, soda
Second favourite. tastes like a strawberry freezie,. more on the acidic side with the kiwi.

Pineapple Mojito ~$7 vodka, pineapple juice, mango & pineapple cider, fresh lime juice, soda, lemon, pineapple
Bitter.. aka not a \"girly drink\" x.x;;

Overall, I liked how different the experience was from what I expected it to be. I find that most teppan places are the same but Flaming Bull puts different ingredients  and a unique spin to it. Portion is quite hefty in comparison to other teppan places too :D I can see myself coming back to try the chicken curry rice with cheese next time.

{"text":"I wish they had 2.5 stars! I enjoyed the experience,  friendly staff, unique when they prepare steak at your table, very clean... The signature beef noodle is good, at $22.60 (minus tip) it's not that good...
I was ready to keep walking because I assumed it would be packed (dinner time on bloor st), it wasn't, lots of tables. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. if it was $12 I'd return, $22 is a one time visit. Too bad...."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto last weekend and happened to walk into this place. It was really crowded on a Saturday night. Ambience was very good, their signature tasting menu looks nice but I wasn't feeling really hungry so I ordered the selected tasting menu. The first appetizer is the appetizer platter which consists of 3-4 different appetizers. The second was the taste of life (pork with 4 colorful dressings). The dishes were visually appealing. I tried the signature beef noodle where a server would come to the table and barbeque the steak in front of you, the concept was interesting and the beef tasted very good. Noodle soup itself could use a bit more flavour but that's just my personal opinion. Dessert was a blast, I really liked the mango panna cotta, its sweetness is right at the level where I wanted it to be. Service was good considering its recent opening. Overall, I would say it's a good place for friend meetups and celebrations."}
{"text":"I always come here for their noodles and this is perhaps one of the best places for delicious beef noodles. The noodles are firm, neither too long nor too short and the noodles were able to absorb the flavor of the soup stock. Speaking of soup stock... it is great. The flavor is neither too strong nor light. Best of all, the beef comes from prime beef, tender and flavorful.
 
Unfortunately, the service is lacking... just a little bit. But hey, in came here for their noodles not for customer service."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner to try their new Halloween dinner menu that will be offered until Oct. 31st. The menu is a set course that consists of three appetizers (salad, soup and tacos), main course and dessert. The interior of the restaurant was modern with a wooden theme throughout the place which was beautiful. 

Dishes we tried:

Seafood Salad - The salad contained shrimp, octopus, mussels and clams. The vegetables chosen for this dish were crispy and light, which was quite refreshing. One thing to note was that the clams were a bit overpowering since it was naturally more stronger in flavour compared to the octopus and shrimp.

Pumpkin Soup - The soup was very creamy with rich flavours from the pumpkin. 

3 in 1 Tacos - We each received a plate that consisted of three different tacos: beef, chicken and pork. The beef taco had a delicious marinade, probably soy sauce based, that was packed with flavour. The chicken taco was the lighter one out of the three. The chicken was very moist and had a sauce that was light and a bit on the sweeter side, which was also very good. The pork taco was definitely my favourite out of the three. The pork marinade reminded me bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) which tasted so good. I liked how they added red cabbage to add texture and balance in flavour. This is a must-have!

Sichuan Style Beef Noodle - I really enjoyed this noodle soup! The broth was rich in flavour, yet light at the same time. The spices and herbs that were used to make this broth reminded me of Vietnamese Pho, which I absolutely love. The noodles were cooked al dente and they soaked up the soup nicely. I liked how they torched the beef for this soup because it added smokiness to the beef which was very tasty. 

Beef Fried Rice Teppanyaki - The Beef Fried Rice Teppanyaki didn't really stand out to me. Although the concept was nice, it would have been better if they added more sauce and possibly use the marinated beef from the taco for this dish (that would be great!).

Mango Panna Cotta - The panna cotta was wonderful! It was very silky and light in flavour, and the mango juice added a nice sweetness to it. Inside the panna cotta was a surprising and fun treat which you'll have to find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have never been to Taiwan and have never tried Taiwanese cuisine but according to my friends, the dishes offered by Flaming Bull are as Taiwanese as it gets.  That's why I became curious and tried them. My first visit was golden. I was never disappointed with their menu from the appetizers to their desserts. Everything is beautiful and delicious.  And the unique way they serve their drinks is really enjoyable."}
{"text":"*They classify themselves as fine-dining Asian cuisine, or at least that's what the owner told me. 
*I don't know how their pricing is going to be, especially in the Annex area where there are a lot of cheap food around for UoT students.
*The interior looks like it belonged to Yorkville area. 
*Service is good, still need to improve but they just opened so it's forgivable
*This review is based on the order of the food that was given to me. I was actually provided with a SET TASTING MENU that day. 

-\"Shake N shake\" salad: 
You put the ingredients into a glass jar with lettuce then shake it. Seems a bit gimmicky imo. The salad was incredibly sweet from the raisins and sweet corn, thus making it an odd way to start the meal. 

-Chili Salmon Soup 
The soup was incredibly spicy and the salmon was overcooked as well. 

-Taste of Life (matsukasa pork shoulder with four secret dressings)
The four secret dressings are: bitter, sweet, sour, salty. Good concept and the pork shoulder had a nice ratio of fat to meat, but the meat itself was quite bland. Except for the salty sauce, the rest didn't pair well with the pork belly at all.

-Shangtang Abalone
The broth was flavorful and light which complimented the tender and slightly chewy abalone. 

-Divine Flame Signature Beef Noodle 
AAA prime steak was seared in front of our eyes. The noodle had a chewy and firm texture while the beef shank was incredibly tender. However I thought the soup was quite bland and spicy, it didn't have any depth of flavor at all.

-Teppanyaki Rice with Curry Chicken 
Similar to Aka Teppan. Curry had a nice kick to it, I thought the chicken was dry and bland.

-Snack Bun 
How is this fine dining or creative if you give me a piece of white toast for a snack bun? Where's my steamed bao!  I could have made this at home with more toppings. Luckily the beef stir fry was juicy and flavorful, otherwise this would have been a bland dish as no sauce was accompanied.

-White Fungus Nectar 
Though the overall soup was not too sweet and the flowers didn't have that overbearing floral scents. It was too simple and they should have paired the dessert with other ingredients to add more flavor, taste and texture to the sweet soup. However due to its simplicity, it worked well with the tasting menu as the previous dishes was quite heavy. But as a dessert on its own, the flavor was not there.

-Mango Panna Cotta
This smooth and decadent panna cotta was pretty much irresistible. I liked that they kept the panna cotta itself almost non-sweetened, which paired well with the sweet mango sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef stew with noodles. As the waitress was pouring the hot stew into the bowl, she ended up pouring some onto my leg which consequently severely burnt my thigh.  She's lucky I didn't make a scene. In addition we requested for our two pots of Ruby tea to be refilled and as a result, we merely had one refilled. In conclusion the waitresses do not listen,  are incredibly careless and are merely \"working\" by standing in the back of the restaurant, gossiping about everything and everyone that they have come across today. 

Pros: good music. 



PS the washroom is horrid"}
{"text":"The two things that stood out for me were the service and the plating of the dishes. The servers were extremely welcoming and nice but it was kinda awkward how they kept assuming I spoke Mandarin.. but eventually we got a server who was fluent in English. 

There aren't that many tables inside but the decor is upscale-ish. However the pricing isn't as bad as you would think.. tasting menus for $66 and $38 and mains around $15-20. We went with the $38 tasting menu and got a decent amount of food: black tea, 2 appetizers, cider, 1 main and 1 dessert. The appetizer was small slices of pork/beef that were quite tasty. It came with 4 sauces that were supposed to represent the sour, sweet, bitter and spicy parts of life.. cool in concept. The stewed beef noodle and signature beef noodle mains were extremely bland though the beef tasted good. I don't recommend the noodles. Definitely get the mango panna cotta dessert though! It was delicious. The white tremella mushroom soup dessert was nothing special. 

I think they're flexible about their business hours since their posted closing time is 10 but they were still accepting customers at 11."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sichuan beef noodle soup and and pineapple mojito while my boyfriend tried their tacos and mango salad. He'a easy to please so I am not sure their tacos are that spectacular. Definitely don't like their mango salad, and the noodle soup. Service is pretty good though and interior is classy but that's about it. I'd rather have great food than the ambiance."}
{"text":"The beef noodle is just so so. But all the other dishes are so good!! And the service is perfect."}
{"text":"It's a total waste of money to try this place. 
The first resturant that, when I walk out, I wanna to get my money back."}
