{"text":"Ive been to this place at least 3x since my last review. 

1st visit back: Sat. night 10 pm. place weas pretty dead but it was chilled out the guy was super nice and drinks were good. (not watered down) we played pool (theres only 1 table @ $1/game) and the guy was super cool with us. this made me want to come back.

2nd visit back: we came to watch the tail end of a football game... chilled out. cool vibe. again, made me want to come back. 

3rd visit back: came here on  a thursday night Christmas EVE EVE and I was searching for the spurs game but everyone was watching the steelers game. booring... we knew who'd win that one. we stayed however and played and were capped after a 3 or 4 drinks and she told us this is the last drink I can comp you on for your play. Hmm. never been told that before but I guess I wasnt losing enough $ for her taste. That's ok. It was a female waitress and I expected it from a female, but never been told that in a bar before where ur drinks are comped for slot play. we ordered wings 

WINGS: 39 cents per wing.. everyday

Ok I'm down. For 39 cents we ordered just to try them. they were actually pretty good. kinda small but for that cheap its understandable. you only get 2 carrot sticks and 2 celery sticks and I'm pretty sure the blue cheese was ranch with a few blue cheese pieces thrown in. but It was good and the drinks were decent.  Odds are: I'll probably be back.  The karaoke was just starting and they had a few good singers. Too bad I'd started drinking around 630 b/c by 9 I was ready to go home. I'm a light weight... and I'm not as young as I used to be. I was ready to call it a night. 
But If ur ever in the mood for karaoke ck this place out. Smoky, yes. but where in LV isnt @ 9pm @ night?"}
{"text":"I guess whoever was part owner or owner of this bar sold out so they no longer are a Chicago Bears bar. I hope the karaoke and open mic night are working for them because it was dead last Sunday with their all NFL games format. Also, the service is not what it use to be or they just don't want to see Bears fans anymore. They clearly had more business when it was a Bears bar. If I want to see all the NFL games I would go to a race & sports book at one of the casinos where they have better pay tables, etc. They still have cheap food here but I am always half scared to eat in places that aren't that busy. While they have cleaned the place up a bit; whoever painted the men's restroom must have bought clearance/ mistake paint as it is the ugliest blue I have ever seen. Good luck to the new ownership/management."}
