{"text":"The food was ok and waitress there was not too friendly. And when she served us we felt very uncomfortable. It's first time and last time."}
{"text":"This is close as you can get to real Hong Kong style atmosphere and food. Felt like I had time traveled back to Mongkok. This is a family restaurant with lot of family interaction for me that was so real I go there often never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Dont Be Afraid!!! Great Beef Chow Fun and dont forget the GINGER FISH.. Pick one of those bad boys out of the tank and ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Price is great, but selection is really poor.  And during lunch they did not replenish the buffet very well.    They were nursing some of the older dry dishes rather than keeping it nice and fresh.  I wouldn't go back.    Rather spend $2 more and get 4 times the choices.  I'm guessing their regular menu is good though ... Food tasted fine."}
{"text":"Food is OK, but the service is not. In fact, I was once *lectured* over the phone as I was making my order. The lady who answered thought I was not educated enough about the differences among Asian fried noodles and said \"Are you sure?\" after each and every noodle order."}
{"text":"Mom and pop restaurants serving authentic Cantonese food is fast facing extinction in the Valley.  After Lucky's on the West side sold to a new owner who decided to Americanize the menu, HK Asian Diner's chef probably cooks the best Cantonese food in the Valley IMHO.  Hurry in before this family decides to sell or retire like New Hong Kong on Indian School in Phoenix is imminently doing. Ask for the authentic menu - don't worry it's in English. If you prefer Northern Chinese food, then you can rejoice in the proliferation of restaurants that have opened recently, like Dinghao, Nanzhou and BJ's in Chandler and Mesa.  I expect this trend to continue where Northern Chinese restaurants continue to proliferate while Cantonese restaurants disappear, as a result of the changing Chinese population, especially students that are coming to Arizona."}
{"text":"The food here, it has to be said, is actually pretty darn good. Have eaten here a number of times, ordering from the Chinese menu; haven't had a bad meal here ever. The lady owner is -- how shall we say? -- enthusiastic in knowing about her customers, a character that sounds like \"eight\" in Cantonese, and I am a private person by nature, so I try to limit my contact to avoid interrogation. Bit pricey, but you pay for good cooking, and they deliver on that promise. (Not literally deliver, of course, you have to pick up but you know what I mean)"}
{"text":"So, we had a reservation for 11 people including 2 high chairs at 6pm, which was made at 10 am. When we got here, 2 other parties were seated before us and were given high chairs. When we asked about the high chairs, they stated they had no more and did not try to accommodate us with anything. So, instead of sitting a mixed race family of 11, you want to seat 2 Chinese family parties? Then force us to get whatever was left and have to deal with it? No apology. No trying to work it out. So bye Felicia. And the FACE of the hostess...was obviously annoyed with us, but that's not even mediocre customer service."}
{"text":"Don't mind the crabby waitress! The buffet is CHEAPER alternative than going to Panda Express (maybe even a bit tastier?). I realize Panda Express is not the best example of Chinese food, but if you are looking for an inexpensive, Americanized Chinese food there is no better.   I can't speak for the traditional Chinese food menu, but I recommend that you do not come here for GOURMET Chinese food.   Also I wish they would clean their fish tank. It was ok until I noticed them taking out a fish and taking it to the kitchen. Then again there is no fish in the buffet ;)"}
{"text":"The only reason I tried / found this place was because I was looking for some take-out on Christmas Day.  Drove to a place down the street from me -- figured it would be open, but wasn't.  GPS...Points of Interest...Restaurants...Chinese -- and I ended up at Hong Kong Asian Diner.    And, am I glad I did.  Our order for 2 adults and 3 kids was:  - BBQ Spare Ribs (app) - Crab Puffs (app) - House Special Fried Rice - Sweet & Sour Pork - Fuji Steak - Shrimp & Lobster Sauce  The food was absolutely delicious and there were plenty of left overs (which reheated amazingly well, some was even good cold).  The Spare Ribs and Fuji Steak stood out as especially good, while the sweet & sour was average.  But overall, it was excellent and we were all very happy with it.  As of this writing I've been back once with the family, and I intend to go back many more times.  On the second trip, we had sweet & sour chicken and I'd say it was just as average as the pork was.  Other new dishes were:  - Seafood Fire Pot: this was quite good, but I doubt I'll order it again.  There was a generous portion of lobster, scallops, and shrimp (for $11, anyway), but it was a little too bland.  - House Lo Mein: this dish pretty much rocked.  The noodles weren't soggy, and it wasn't too greasy either.  This place has a fairly extensive menu.  And, the lunch combo prices look unbeatable.  For under $5, you get soup, egg roll, crab pubb, fried rice, and your entree.  The atmosphere is very casual, and the service reminds me of a good San Francisco Chinatown dive.  Not exactly a good date restaurant, but great for a date between the red bbq spare ribs and your stomach.  Definitely keep this place in mind for take-out.  I can't imagine anyone regretting giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"We went for their lunch buffet, which has a limited amount of food but it's all the best of the buffet choices and the price is unbeatable.  I loved their fried rice and chow mein, could not get enough of their orange chicken, chicken wings and chicken skewers.  Everything I tried was really good.  Like others have said, the service kinda sucks, the waitress was kinda rude when we got in because a big crowd had entered right behind us but she did get nicer throughout the meal.  The desserts section of the buffet was definitely lacking as well.  If you are looking for extremely well priced lunch buffet of great Chinese staples, this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is in the Fry's Marketplace shopping center, on the northwest corner of Ray and Rural. Not horrible, but not really good, either, and I really wanted it to be good because I needed another Asian take-out place for when Thai Basil was closed (during their annoying after lunch / before dinner break, or on Sundays) or I didn't want to shell out the big bucks for Swaddee across the street.  So, their take-out process: they've never botched an order, but the food's never once been ready within the time frame given - I usually have to sit and wait and watch while somebody else comes in, orders, gets their food and leaves, when I freakin' called ahead.  And the food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they're all just ok. It's cheap Chinese. If that's what you and your wallet are in the mood for, it'll work."}
{"text":"Not a place to consider for Asian food in the neighborhood. We gave this a try after not having been back for 10 years, and we are sorry we gave it another shot. The place was dirty, stacked with junk in the corners, and the lunch buffet was poor. We arrived at 11:15, and the food was already cold. I'm sure that if the department of health had measured food temperature it would have failed to have been hot enough to pass safety standards.   There are many great Asian restaurants within a 3-mile radius. I won't list them here, but any of them would serve you a better meal for the same cost."}
{"text":"We waited for more than an hour to get our food. Despite the wait, the food is great and authentic. They should allocate more staff during peak hours."}
{"text":"They serve cantonese style Chinese food. I'd say you really have to know how to order to really enjoy good Chinese food because there are so many dishes you can choose from. I think they have a buffet here, but I wouldn't try it if I were you. Good food doesn't come in all-you-can-eat. Pay a little extra and really enjoy your food. Quality over quantity.  The service here is not so great but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food is Excellent. Usually do carry out. Place is always busy. Staff is great. I have become a regular. They have 2 menu's, American and Traditional Chinese food."}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE unless.... you like being belched at in your FACE!!! The woman was in great need of deodorant. Also if you like armpits that you can braid on a woman go there. But the food was ok and the wait isn't to bad,but the lady was extremely rude."}
{"text":"I think this is a reliable Chinese buffet because once I was the only white person in the place.  And I have eaten here several times and have been fine.  I'm sorry, but that's everyone's biggest fear with all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet.  I eat here and even though the buffet is always the same and the place is run down and a little filthy, the food is just what you expect.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Food is delicious- but the customer service sucks big time!  Always tasty and flavorful, left overs are even better. So if you don't mind their lack in pleasantries- manners- and table side service, then this is a great diner.  Many just get their order to go!  We're big on fabulous customer service, otherwise I would have given them a better rating!"}
{"text":"As someone who is Chinese and eats out a lot, I feel I need to defend this place. Sure service is not the best here and the American-Chinese food leaves a little to be desired, this place does authentic Cantonese the best in the valley.   A few things to try (don't know the official name but description should help waitress) out are the lamb hot bowl, stuffed duck, their mellon soup (actually cooked in a mellon and very tasty), and the fried breaded fish. Very authentic and very good. If you can live with the service and experiment with the food the experience is very rewarding. Just look at the customer base. You know they are doing something right when the restaurant is 90% full of Chinese people and the consensus among local Chinese is this place rivals the best Chinese food found in NYC, LA, SF, etc."}
{"text":"How does this place stay open? I haven't eaten here for around 8 or so years but when I pass by I have flashbacks of our visit. We sat by the fish tank that had 2 1/2 fish swimming around...I say 1/2 because one of the fish was trying to stay up right and alive! We were so engrossed by the dying fish (not a goldfish) that they finally came over and threw a table cloth over the tank. The food sucked! I was always told,\"you know it's good Chinese food if there are a lot of Asians eating in the place.\" Not true...not true at all!"}
{"text":"For dinner, it's probably the best Chinese food in the Valley.  The ambience is mediocre but the food is can be spectacular.  Some of the hot pot dishes, i.e. the pork belly, eggplant with fish, have a spectacular blend of flavors that is hard to replicate.  A lot of foreign born Chinese people come here and if you know what you want to order, ask the chef if he'll make it.  The suggested family dinners are a good start and I suggest adding or substituting what you like from there.  Modest prices for good food."}
{"text":"As the AZ review suggests, just a stellar example of Cantonese cuisine prepared simply so that the very fresh ingredients shine. Great value for dinner."}
{"text":"Super good for Chinese taste, love them! Especially the soup, they are almost the best in town!! Reasonable price is a bonus point."}
{"text":"We ordered the house fried rice & two chicken entrées. The fried rice was awesome! Chicken, pork & shrimp. Delish! We were a little disappointed that all dark meat was used. We ended up making our own chicken the next night and mixing it with the other ingredients. That tasted awesome."}
{"text":"Very authentic. Ordered off the menu with the Peking duck, sizzling black bean and fish, steamed fish, and many others. Extremely tasty and excellent prices. If you want Americanized Chinese go elsewhere and leave space for people who want an amazing place. Service is a family business and not fancy, have patience and enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice little family place. Some of the dishes I had didn't taste quite right. Overall, pretty authentic though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is for true Chinese food lovers.  If you want Orange Chicken or Sweet and Sour anything--go to Panda Express.  The atmosphere at Hong Kong Asian Diner is authentic Cantonese-style and wouldn't be complete without the loudness and chaos. I highly recommend the crispy fried chicken (complete with chicken head) and garlic green beans.  You have to understand the Chinese culture to wholly appreciate Hong Kong Asian Diner."}
{"text":"I really like the food in this restaurant, every item I've ordered is very good, good pricing also. This is where it ends, the service is just OK. I have an issue with all the staff, borderline rude at times. Language barriers ? They do have a large Asian clientele."}
{"text":"I returned for the Moo Goo Gai Pan.  Always a treat.  This time got the Wor Won Ton Soup for $5.25 that feeds two.  Broth is well flavored but salty.  Just enjoy the wealth of ingredients:  broccoli, cabbage, snow peas, baby corn, shrimp, won ton, char shiu pork, carrots, mushrooms and white meat chicken!  Mmmm...."}
{"text":"Walked in, took one look at the \"so called buffet\", sat down in a seat torn, sticky tabled booth, looked at each other and got up and walked out.....enough said"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service and the BAD attitude of the owner ruins the experience!!! Went in on a busy night. You could see by the look on the daughter's face, one of the servers, that she was really stressed out. I made a comment about how busy it was, she smiled back at me, saying that everyone came in at the same time. I told her to \"hang in there\" and that she was doing a good job. We ordered as soon as we sat down. The soup came quickly. We watched as another group, who came in after us, was seated after we had placed our order. Almost an hour later, we saw that group get served their order. My wife asked how much longer for us. The owner said, \"It's OK, your food is cooking. 15 more minutes passed and we said we were leaving and paid for the soup. No apologies were offered. We were regular customers here, but we will NEVER eat here again. Go to TAO GARDEN, at Warner and Alma School. The food is better and the service is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"went here for lunch with Rand H. and it was pretty good with about 40 or so items it was like one of the typical Indian buffets in size. The soups egg drop and hot and sour were both really good,I had a bowl of each.The main dishes were all done to perfection , five stars for most of them.Well maybe all of them. They were a little weak on the dessert items though. They had jello ,sliced peaches and those little white balls i think there called lychee. Anyway it was a great lunch at a good price $5.75 the service kind of sucks or they could have made 5 stars but because the food was so good i give them 4."}
{"text":"Pretty close to authentic Chinese cantonese style food. My dad, born and raised in Hong Kong likes this place quite a bit. Salt and Pepper pork chops and Honey Walnut Shrimp are a must try."}
{"text":"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,  neither cast ye your pearls before swine,  lest they trample them under their feet,  and turn again and rend you.  If you come here for the buffet seriously WTF? Why are you still alive? There's a Panda Express just down the street on the other side of the 101. This place is for some seriously awesome Chinese food. Reject the gwai-lo menu and insist on the menu that is mostly Chinese characters but also has descriptions in English. Thanks to the reviews of fellow yelpers I had the deep-fried taro duck. Wow! This dish is definitely a must and I order it all the time now. I've had the Yui Shan Eggplant and Mabo Tofu as well. I really like this restaurant's take on both dishes. Last time that I came here, I ate in with a bunch of friends. They offered a special - which was roast duck. Haven't had anything here that was not delicious. While dining, we saw them take out a few fish from the huge tank they have right in the middle of the restaurant. Then all of a sudden you would hear BAM! BAM! BAM! LOL. Can't argue the fish isn't fresh. Next time I'll have to actually order some fish dish. This place is like a well kept secret - I've driven by so many times to go to Fry's but somehow it never occurred to me to check this place out. Glad I finally did. Hong Kong Asian Diner (???) is definitely a keeper! Located in the mall with Fry's on the NW corner of Ray and Rural. Plentiful parking."}
{"text":"Literally love this place. The number one reason is because of the crab puffs/cream cheese rangoons (every place calls them different). I judge a place based on these tasty little devils and I haven't another half as good.  I order Beef Broccoli and or Sweet & Sour chicken every time. I can't vouch for other menu items because I literally order the same thing every time (i'm just that kind of person). Sweet & sour shrimp isn't as good however; it's usually dry and a lot of breading."}
{"text":"This little gem of a restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall connected to a Fry's Marketplace.  I would have never noticed the place if it weren't for the big letters on the window proclaiming \"Lunch Buffet - $5.95\".  Somehow my radar has been finely tuned to pick up on these words.  Of the three times I've been here, I've only had the buffet twice.  That ill-fated third visit was marred by my being fifteen minutes late.  By that time the buffet had already been cleared, so get there on time.  Buffet runs 11:30am-1pm.  The six dollar price tag for the lunch buffet is worth it.  They only have about ten items but they're quality dishes.  Americanized but good.  Hot and sour is the only soup option on the buffet but that's fine by me.  It's awesome hot and sour soup.    I love the stir fried green beans with garlic, sesame chicken, roasted chicken, BBQ pork fried rice and the egg rolls.    I think there's only like two hostesses/waitresses.  One seems pretty crabby and not very welcoming.  I like her.  What's a meal without a little anxiety?  Been three times and I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"After having read the AZ critic's review of a particular dish at this restaurant, I had to try it. The fish sausage dish was soggy but the sauce was fabulous!   I ate every last vegetable that accompanied the fish/sausage just to sop up more of this tasty sauce!  The Chow fun was just run of the mill but okay."}
{"text":"Really good food!  Whenever I'm here, I always see a few Asian families enjoying dinner.  I take that as a good sign,  They have two menus- one is typical Americanized Chinese food and one is more authentic- make sure you look at both of them.  Our family has had several items from both menus- everything is fresh and delicious.   I tried the fried taro duck because others have recommended it.  It was really tasty, but I had forgotten how rich duck is and couldn't eat more than half my generous serving.  It was good the next day, though!   Other reviews mention that the service is bad or rude.  Maybe the waitress's accent makes her english sound a little clipped, which could be misinterpreted as short tempered, I guess.  We've always had pleasant, efficient service.   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My parents have lived nearby this restaurant ever since it opened and for no reason we never tried it out. My Dad and I love to go get Chinese food, it's kind of our thing. We finally decided to try them out one night and OH MY WORD! I had been missing out on a hidden treasure for years! I was in total disbelief and I was upset with myself for waiting so long to try the food there. Their food tastes absolutely amazing! I love their egg rolls! This is hands down my favorite Chinese food restaurant now! I won't go anywhere else. :-) I'm also a super skeptic about Chinese food places I don't know. So, if you're like me, trust me this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was the reason this buffet fan made the rather long trip from central Phoenix. I came at 12:30 pm, the peak of the lunch rush, so I figured that the food should still be at its best. I found the buffet offerings to be quite limited - mainly popular items you would find in any standard Chinese restaurant.  Service was fine and the dishes tasted OK, not knock-your-socks-off great. I would not make another drive from CenPho just  for the buffet, but if I were already in the area and hungry, I'd give the buffet another try. Or I'd order from the regular menu and see what some other reviewers were raving about."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant twice. The first time I when to this places to join my friend's birthday. Everything was good. The food was delicious. The Second time I brought my boyfriend. We had orange chicken. The chicken is not fresh!!!!! my boyfriend has really bad diarrhea. First, I didn't think bout is the food bad! But when I got home! Same thing happened to me! And that day the food I only eat is the chicken! I will never come to this restaurant again !!"}
{"text":"Yummy Food!  Came here with my family yesterday for dinner and I was very pleased with our food. Though I don't know the American names we had what one could amount to as a feast! Chicken, Duck, Beef, Soup, Fried Tofu and more! If you like Chinese food this is a great place to visit.  I've never had the buffet, but would love to given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Good service, did not take long for food to come out nice and hot. Overall the food was average a little on the bland side could've used more flavors."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. The food is good and the price was very reasonable. Is this the best Chinese food in town? No. But, it reminded me of my first encounter with Chinese food as a kid. Sizzling rice soup. Mongolian beef. Sesame chicken. All were very good. Simple, inexpensive and enjoyable.  I will try the \"Hong Kong Menu\" next time as it looked very interesting."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm, I love this place, I will have to say though if you are looking for a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant this is not the place for you. While they do have an \"American menu\" they also have a huge traditional Chinese menu (you might need to ask for it) We are regulars here and while one of my favorite dishes here is their spicy mongolian beef, my fiance John and I also love the fish with black bean sauce, salted fish fried rice, tangerine beef, wonton soup, chicken corn chowder and their peking duck as well. They also have a lunch buffet during the week for $5.75 however we have never tried that as we know what we like to order when we stop in. Overall I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place when we craving good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"As a Chinese guy here in Arizona it's pretty hard to find any decent Chinese food.  I mean, if PF Chang's is your idea of authentic, you need to get your head checked then come to HK Asian Diner. This fine establishment is one of the few places that one can get a pretty authentic Chinese meal.  Just look at the usual crowd that frequents the restaurant and you know it's the real deal.  I can't really pick any specific dishes out that I particularly enjoy, but pretty much anything off the \"Chinese\" menu is pretty solid.    In conclusion, get out of your comfort zone and try something new.  The only thing that should scare you about this place is the HK gangster waitress. She may come off as rude, but that's just how they do it back in the home country so don't fret. Go there and you'll see what I mean haha."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a gazillion times over a period of 20+ years.  I have always thought the food was OK here.  A few times over these years, I have ordered off the Cantonese menu and the food was good --- not great but good.  But most of the time, we eat lunch here and have the buffet.  The buffet item menu has not changed in eons....the same menu over and over again.  And, I think the buffet is 3 stars at best.  The hot & sour soup on the buffet is excellent -- one of the best hot and sour soups you will find.  And their crispy fried/salt & pepper pork chops are good too, although I wished they would put more jalapenos in the garnish/toppings.  But the main reason I keep going back here again and again and again, is for my haole (white) girlfriend.  She loves the sesame chicken on the buffet -- she says it is the best sesame chicken she has ever experienced and believe me, she orders that a lot in Chinese restaurants, even when I take her back to Hawaii on vacation.  She also says their fried, cream cheese won tons are the best too (they put some imitation crab meat in them)!  So if you have a haole girlfriend who likes sesame chicken, you should try this place."}
{"text":"Foodies, don't let this place deceive you! They are running two businesses under one guise. The first is regular ol' ho mogwai (not cute furry creature, but basically Chinese for gringo) food. There are two menus here and depending on what you look like (yes, I know it's discrimination) they will give you the blue menu or the pink menu. Sometimes they may give you both if you appear to be down with it! The pink menu is full of sweet and sour chicken and other morsels Americans expect in their Chinese \"adventures\" The blue menu is the Chinese menu (translated in to what is at times, very humorous Engrish). You may have to ask for this beauty.   The clientele in the eat in part of the business is largely Chinese and this usually speaks volumes to the quality to price ratio at Chinese places. The Chinese patrons typically receive an earthenware pot of soup called \"daily soup\" that is totally free. The soup is different everyday, and often has ingredients favored in Chinese medicine. My kids like it, so we get it. It isn't offered to everyone, so if you want it, ask for it.   We have a few favorites here that include seafood chow fun (with gravy), monks platter (an array of mushrooms unlike any I've ever known, paired with tofu), stir fry fish with vegetables (sauteed whitefish with Ginger and baby bok choy), something that I believe is called Peking rib (a staple at most tables, crunchy red goodness), fried calamari, and many others currently evading me.   A portion of our family is Chinese, and so we always celebrate Chinese New Year with wonderful seafood dishes. We have typically shared this meal at C-Fu to watch their lion dance performance. This year C-Fu canceled the show, so we couldn't see paying twice as much for food that definitely isn't twice as good. We fed 16 people for around 120 dollars this year. It was awesome!   Do know that the loss of a star is only due to the fact that the staff is discriminatory. We have come in before (before our Chinese relatives arrive) and chopsticks and tea cups were removed from the table. The staff can be quite brusque until you get to know them. We've been coming in for two years now and it has taken this long for them to start being friendly. The food, however, supersedes any lack of manners in the staff. Go in and make the decision that their antics are comical rather than hurtful and like the platter clean!"}
{"text":"We used to like this place but on Xmas day yesterday the service and food were terrible--we waited an HOUR after ordering before anyone came to tell us they were out of the noodles we ordered! Either our first server did not know or care or they sold the noodles to someone else.  How can this restaurant, always crowded on Xmas Day, run out of noodles?  Bad planning. They were also out of BBQ pork. The egg foo young we also ordered had been completely forgotten as well. Then she recommended sweet and sour entree, so we ordered pork.  It was terrible--fried, greasy and no sour, only sweet.  The egg foo young was tasteless and covered with a watery gravy without any spices at all.  When we complained about the wait, we were told some customers had waited 2 hours!  As if that's an excuse.  Food and service were so bad we won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried several dishes today. Only the vegetable was served hot. The others were not even warm. Roasted duck was tasteless and dull. eek..."}
{"text":"After reading the 1 star reviews, I was reminded of the last time I ate here (2yrs ago).  The place was rediculously crowded, the wait staff was running around like it was their 1st time working at a restaurant, they had what looked like 5th-9th grade girls (owners daughters?) serving drinks and seating people.  \".....hey, let's open up a restaurant, how hard can it be?  it's not rocket science....\"  There were several 10-seat tables with lazy-susan's (sorry if your name is susan) that were reserved while throngs of customers waitied for the 4-person booths and smaller tables to open up.  Meanwhile, there were 3-4 tables waiting to be cleared as the waitresses looked like they were swamped.  Bringing out 1 order what looked like every 10mins.  we reluctantly conceded to taking a booth and 2 small tables for our family of 15 all the while eyeing the 10-seat banquet style tables with hand written scraps of paper shouting \"reserved\"  it took forever for them to come and take our order.  the waitress was making us nervous with her fast talking and sense of urgency to get back to serving food to the other tables.  so to make it easy, we just ordered double-portions of about 10 different dishes and we never saw her again until our 1st entree came out.  the whole dinner took in excess of 2 hrs   i remember saying that there are plenty of other places to eat with the same quantity, quality and price and much closer to east chandler where we live.  fast forward to august 27th, 2010....I entered this place again with fear and trepidation.  so i thought of a new strategy, have my wife who speaks fluent cantonese call in a reservation for 10 and we'll get the royal treatment.  as i listened to the jiberish dialogue, and my wife promptly hangs up the phone, i asked, \"she didn't even ask for a reservation name or phone number?\"  wife:  NO  greaaaat.  it was not an official reservation i shouted!  we'll get there, and the there will be no 10-seat banquet style lazy-susan equipped table available and the hostess will look at us and say, \"what name was it under?\"  so for the next 5 mile drive, i was thinking about what i was going to say when i arrived to our destination.  \"....hi, were chinese and have a reservation for 10.....\"  \"...reservation for 10, for the mayor of chandler..\"  so when i swung open the door, the waitress/hostess greeted me with a \"how many?\" gesture (don't ask me what that's supposed to look like) and i held up both my hands with 8 fingers and 2 thumbs outstretched.  much to my surprise, she smiled and pointed to the 10-seat-lazy-susan.  for those of you who had a \"bad service\" experience, i have to let you in on a little secret:   this is going to sound racist, but if you don't speak the lingo, they're not gonna carry on a \"hi, how are you, and how's your family\" conversation.  I don't speak a lick of chinese and if i were to eat here alone, they'd snuff me.  since my dutiful wife is fluent, gregarious and has a lovely demeanor, they love her and chat her up.  they make recommendations, ask her how old her daughter is, how cute it is that she can speak cantonese too.  and i'm sure they're asking why doesn't your chinese-looking husband speak chinese?  is he one of those \"slow\" ones?  i having been raised for 3 generations in AZ, used to think, \"these people really look down upon me for my ignorance\"  but i've come to realize that perhaps they just feel more comfortable speaking to someone in their native language as opposed to the semi-complicated english(?)  in my 47 years of eating at 100's of different chinese restaurants, i can only count on 1 hand the few that have had great \"western style\" service. (think PFChang, pei-wei, panda express, noodle ranch).  does that make me stop eating at chinese restaurants?  if that were the case, then i would have to avoid eating at the top 10 chinese restaurants (as far as the food, price and quantity goes) in phoenix.  3 out of 4 i can live with.  good food, good quantity, bad prices, bad service.....i will go but only if someone insists on going  good food, bad quantity, bad prices, bad service (see wong's place)....if family members drag me there and are paying  bad food, good quantity, good prices, good service.....no way jose  you get the picture.  turns out there are as good places that are  1) closer in proximity 2) as good quality 3) same prices 4) same service (with wife or mom in tow)  so it's not a must have place to run to  if you live in chandler and awhatukee, you have my 4 stars"}
{"text":"It's a near hour drive to Hong Kong Asian Diner, but after Chow Bella listed the deep fried duck with taro as one of the 100 Favorite Dishes I knew I had to give it a try.  WOW, just WOW. The duck is wrapped in mashed taro and the whole thing gets deep-fried. The duck is moist and savory, the taro is smooth and creamy, and the exterior that holds the whole thing together provides a satisfying crunch that is music to my ears and a textural experience for my palate. I ate it all. I could not resist.  I can't wait to go back. It is definitely worth the long drive. I will try new dishes, but those will be in addition to my deep fried duck with taro!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and this will be the last time. The buffet is very limited in selection and when they do not bring out new hot food it is terrible. I waited for over 20 minutes for them to bring out any type of hot food and it never happened. The owner and bus women both noticed there were empty buffet items but they did nothing. More important stuff on their phone. What a waste of time and money. This sucks because in the past I did like the hot and sour soup and spicy shrimp. Never again!"}
{"text":"Arrived about 6PM, two other customers in the entire place.  Atmosphere is a complete fail, no music.  I don't want to dine while being able to hear the couple in the booth next to me chew their food, or listen the employees in the kitchen.  Wanted something spicy, so ordered the Mongolian Beef, which is labeled on the menu as a spicy dish. I emphasized that I like this dish very spicy.  Not even close.  Absolutely the blandest \"spicy\" Chinese food I've ever had.  You can expect better from chain Chinese fast food outlets.  Also, I'm accustomed to a bowl of egg-drop soup as part of my meal.  When I asked about it, I was told it was extra.  Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  Very impersonal staff bordering rudeness.   Wouldn't want to pick a fish from the very filthy fish tank!  YUCK!  Tea tasted just like water, but was the color of tea...still trying to figure out where the taste went!  I'd move on to the next restaurant on the list were I you."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in and were seated by a lady who treated awfully.  She showed us our table and, as we sat down, she tossed the menus onto the table.  We browsed through the menu a bit and waited for the lady to come back but she was on the phone talking real loud; almost yelling in her native tongue.  This went on for about 5 minutes then a younger lady walked in, went into the kitchen, started working; never came to greet or had anything to do with us.  Another 10 minutes passed....the first lady was still on the phone.  The other, younger lady, never acted like we existed.  So we did what any sensible patron would do: We left.    If there was any 0 star rating, I would certainly give it 0 stars.  I would not give this place a 1 star because that's too good for them but, since I can't go lower, a 1 star it is.  I hate to be so harsh but after being treated like that..."}
{"text":"We love the Hong Kong Asian Diner.  Their salt shrimp and calamari are phenomenal.  We try everything else each time and add one of those. It's always fantastic!"}
{"text":"There is nothing truer than you get what you pay for.  The $6.25 lunch rate sounds pretty awesome however the food doesn't even match $1.00. All the dishes are super greasy, salty, etc. Just to put this on the right perspective, Panda Express and Pei Wey menu have much better quality and the dish itself has a better look.  The place is not as clean as it should be. Just to begin with, the guy who collects the dishes carries a garbage cart throughout the entire room and dispose the leftovers in a bucket right in front of you. It is pretty much like you were eating in the dishwashing kitchen area.  If you really like Chinese food, avoid this place because they have no idea what food from the mainland is."}
{"text":"Chinese buffets have a low ceiling... am I right?  Hong Kong Asian Diner understands and (dare I say) embraces this concept.  Rather than overwhelming you with sub-standard desserts and rice-filled sushi, HKAD delivers a small buffet of about 8 solid Chinese dishes for a very low price ($5.75).  They also have a \"salad bar\" that is so unbelievably terrible that I assume the chef is trying to be ironic.  [It's lettuce, jell-o cubes, canned fruit, and 2 salad dressings, and it's probably refreshed weekly.]  The egg drop soup was tasty although over-peppered.  I had two favorite dishes on the buffet:  asian green beans (perfectly cooked with some crunch left in them), and Kung Pao shrimp (which goes quickly after it's refilled.  Stay alert.)  The Mongolian beef and beef & broccoli were tender, although the broccoli was overcooked as usual at buffets.  The two type of sweet, deep-fried chicken bites were both enjoyable.  I preferred the lighter, sweeter sesame chicken.  [BTW: nothing was labeled, so I'm winging it with the names if you haven't noticed.]  Other than that, there were some disappointing noodles and the classic staples of fried rice & egg rolls that I couldn't eat due to their porkiness.  Although this doesn't read like a rave review, this place is a steal for $5.75.  It's way better than a comparably-priced trip to Panda Express.  I'll take it over those large buffets that are twice as expensive and four times as large.  The food is fresher and I don't have to wonder questions like, \"Why does this huge Chinese buffet also have pizza and french fries?\""}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite Chinese places before we moved away from this area. From my experience and the way my family ate growing up this place is authentic. They will also accommodate some of my special requests from when I was younger. The place seems to be family owned and operated, which is another plus in my book. I have not had anything here I did not enjoy. I've only eaten in a few times and the rest were take-out. I cannot tell you about anything sweet and sour or any of the more \"American\" dishes, though."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for Chinese food. The owners are from Guangdong , China. Food is somehow authentic."}
{"text":"Love love their steamed fish, fresh, flavorful and healthy! Seafood tofu soup (thin not the thick) is also very good! The seafood in the broth is tender, not over cooked! 5 stars  it is!"}
{"text":"Great Food, order off the menu (ask your server for advice).  Apparently they have two different menus, 1 for Americanized Chinese & 1 for authentic Chinese.  I was not advised of the second menu when I went, but my waitress helped me out none the less and I had a very good meal (we did however order the Americanized orange peal chicken and loved it.  lightly breaded and fried no to oily though)"}
{"text":"horrible service, very rude staff. if you are white you will not receive good service, all 3 tables that were asian families were helped and we were passed by every time. We had to get up to get refills, boxes and the check. the food is good but i will never return."}
{"text":"Had high expectations base on y'all's rating!! Horrible place, won't be come back. First things first, if you have customers please don't change your fish tank while we're eating, fish was flapping around. Wasn't a pleasant seen or vibe! Than there's the buffet bar, small and there was no food!!! Just scraps! Paid 8bucks for buffet.. No music, complete silences! Food was too seasoned, sweet and sour chicken was like eating a donut! Horrible place don't eat here.."}
{"text":"Good authentic hk style food!   Service is questionable but the flavors are great!   Try the fried noodles, beef and fungus, and fried taro duck if you get the chance :)"}
{"text":"The food is good. The sesame chicken is awesome! BUT.... the customer service is not good. I asked for extra sauce on the sesame chicken and the lady taking the order said she can't do that because the sauce has honey....HUH????? Needless to say... there was not extra sauce. Also when I placed the order I asked for an extra cup of sweet and sour for our crab puffs, and of course, there was no extra sauce like I had asked for. I asked for it again before I left and I just got this dirty look.   When we went to pick it up, there was not a single person in the restaurant eating, and it was dinner time. Three employees were just sitting in chairs talking. This bugged me because the restaurant was not very clean. That place should be sparkling if they are so slow they can sit around and chat. They need to work on customer service and the presentation of their restaurant to compete with the other  Asian restaurants around here."}
{"text":"I have been searching for some Good Chinese food since moving here from Cali last year. Found this place on Yelp and since it had a Family Style Menu on the back decided to try it last night. I called in and placed a order for pick up. I ordered two of the Hong Kong Special Dinners. I chose that one because of the Pu Pu Platter. Everything was soooo goood!!!! The Wonton Soup was very fresh and good with Shrimp and Pork along with vegetables.Everything was good and fresh. The only negative was the BBQ Ribs were kind of dried out. But I did order close to closing, so I will give them a pass. I really want some Honey Shrimp and Crab Fried Rice and the menu doesn't show that it's available here. But will definitely eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"what the. TWO good Chinese restaurants in Phoenix in one week?!?!?  order from the Chinese menu for dinner. Love that homestyle mysterious soup that they serve from that funky brown soup urn. I have NO clue what is in it or what it's called, but everytime we have that at a restaurant, it's been good!  i was a bit surprised, as my in-laws picked this place out, and we tend to differ in our restaurant tastes... but this was a pleasant surprise! Everything was fresh and flavorful; non of that mysterious goopy-like quality on every plate.  the wait staff speaks Canto, Mandarin, and Toisan."}
{"text":"I always enjoyed the food here. The customer service is really terrible but the food is what kept me coming back. Yesterday i was really disappointed. It was a holiday for them I believe so it was really packed. I called so I could order to go and she immediately told me it'd be a 45 minute wait. I was like, for two things?! I still went ahead and ordered it because my husband really wanted that for the night. So I actually left my house after an hour and my food was still not ready. I waited an extra 35 minutes after I got there. I waited almost 2 hours for two things. One which was just a soup. Unbelievable that really just did it for me. I will not be returning here if you're not Asian they will not take care of you. Trust me I have seen it I used to come here all the time. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food on the traditional menu is really good but not so much on the American menu except for the house fried rice which is AMAZING!  I usually order their beef choy sum over noodles, beef chow fun, salt/pepper pork, shrimp stuffed tofu, and house fried rice which all have been really good!"}
{"text":"This place is okay, the wait staff are slow, they rush you for your order and even,gets the order wrong after you repeated a few times, I crab puff, hot and sour soup which was okay I had better but the fried rice was good, I just wish they had better customer service, and the wait for food was 30 min and I was eating there, never asked if I was okay or if I needed a refill . So I don't think I'm ever come back here"}
{"text":"Service = negative one million stars.  Almost walked out until my much smarter friend reminded me fellow yelpers warned us about the gosh awful rudeness.  Food = not that many buffet options but everything they did have was very good.  Orange chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, some other chicken mixture were my favs.  And its cheap!    cheap + full belly = good lunch choice.  Maybe not good for a date night :)  I'd go again now that I know they are rude consistently and not just to a select few."}
{"text":"Slim pickings at this buffet.  Half filled containers of cold food.  The food was a little better when they finally refilled.  The shrimp and hot and sour soup were good.  The deep fried stuff was mostly bread with a little piece of meat.  The salad was basic, lettuce only and maybe a carrot or two.  Wasn't really worth the $6.99.  Rather pay a bit more for something edible.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Nnnnooooo, my family ordered take-out from this place yesterday (12/24/2015). Aside from the place being empty, fam was still hopeful it would taste good.  We got the Ya Shan Beef, Orange Beef, and the House Chow Mein. We got 1 box of rice(???), Ya Shan Beef was way too watery and had no flavor, House Chow Mein had no flavor, and the Orange Beef was seriously over salted, and way overcooked, we ended up trying to mix it up with the Chow Mein to get past it!  The portions are small compared to other Asian restaurants we've eaten and had take-out from. For $27 tax included, we got 3 \"Chinese take-out\"-sized boxes and 1 \"Chinese take-out\"-sized box of rice :\ For that price we were better off going to our regular place we usually order Chinese at!  So yeah, not coming back here again"}
{"text":"Was referred here by the owner's of 1st Class Reflexology for a late lunch. I ordered the salt and pepper squid, pea shoots stir fried in garlic, and the HK style beef and gai lan chow mein. Everything was excellent and piping hot! The owner, Choi and her son were very pleasant and friendly and I will definitely be back!  They do not have any live seafood, but they told me that if I call ahead, they can make fresh lobster and crab for me. I would highly recommend this place for some good Cantonese cooking! It is not fancy, but the food quality was very good and the prices reasonable. I wish I lived closer as this would be somewhere where I would definitely order take out all the time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered take-out from here in the past and it was great. This review is strictly based on the horrible customer service that I experienced this past Saturday afternoon. My grandmother, mother, and I all came in around 3:30pm after we had our nails done. We were celebrating our birthdays and were excited to enjoy a nice late lunch together.   When we walked in it looked as though they were closed. There were about 6 employees sitting at a table that we clearly interrupted when we walked in. At first I thought they were closed, there was no music playing and all of the employees glared at us as we were brought to a table.  5 minutes after being seated the rude woman came back. We asked if we could order from the lunch menu and she said no, it's not lunch anymore and quickly walked away. When she finally came back, we ordered. Two of the dishes showed up together, the other 10 minutes later. They dropped of the final dish with no explanation as to why it took so long. And during our meal no one ever came over to check if everything was okay.  If it weren't for the fact that my grandmother has a hard time getting up and walking, I would have left. Although the food is good, the service here is terrible. And for that reason I will never go back."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Of course I had to come with all Asians to appreciate this place. I really have little clue the name of the things they ordered but I enjoyed IT ALL!  My favorite¿? a Taro/Duck fried cake they have! just amazing. There is a complementary soup they serve before everything and that is a MAJOR PLUS! So get your Cantonese speaking friend and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong is a tried and true Hong Kong flavored cuisine that I've been going to for more than 10 years. When I used to live across the street in this place, I've had weeks where we've come here for dinner 2-3x a week!! I've also seen parents of many of my Asian friends eating here since they think it is one of the top Asian diners in the East valley as well! The food here is very authentic and I haven't had too much of the American Chinese food here so I won't comment on those. The service is probably lacking compared to most American chains but something familiar to those from China. If you come for dinner you get free soup as well!  What to order: black pepper beef, walnut shrimp, fried taro Duck, beef with egg sauce chow fun, green beans in XO sauce, lamb with bean curd in hotpot, Cantonese style seafood pan fried noodles, preserved vegetables with pork, or salt and pepper pork chops. Any of those options are great and staples of HK dining. If you're not sure what to order pick from the list above!!"}
{"text":"This is actually a pretty authentic place; the service is pretty rude, the American inspired Chinese dishes don't taste that great, but the real Chinese dishes are pretty damn great.  If you're looking to bring a date, unless you are going for real casual, don't bother.  But if you're looking for a relatively low priced place where you can find a few dishes that rival San Francisco China Town's holes in the wall, turn a blind eye on the imported service and take your chopsticks and randomly choose something on the menu.  Well, that's what I did atleast.  I come here if I'm going to be in Phoenix for a couple of days, and always find myself full and with some leftovers for tomorrow. As for what to choose, well if you're someone with a sense of adventure ask the service what's their favorite, you might be disgusted and blown away all within the same hour."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worse customer service. We set a reservation 8 hrs in advance and when we walked in, they seated another family ahead of us!! They proceeded to scold us and said we did not place the reservation with enough notice. We left shortly after. Not giving them a dime of my hard earned money. Only giving one 1 star because I can't give 0."}
{"text":"100% agree with the other reviewers. Our menus were thrown at us as well as a silverware.  Everything spoken to us was just shy of a grunt. Water was never refilled. The food was good but if you are not a native then you will be snubbed and treated as a bother rather than a customer. Won't be back.  2 stars is only for the food. Service is negative stars"}
{"text":"Great food. I just can't believe that as long as we've lived in the area we only recently began dining here.  It's in a strip mall and I've known long enough that many of the really good restaurants really do occupy spots in strip malls.  So why did it take us so long? Well I can tell you the reason we did finally come here is because the sushi place across the road had no vacant tables and I wasn't going to stand where there was no lobby or seating and wait for a table.   So Yelp and my fellow Yelpers to the rescue. This was the closest restaurant open and we're typically game for trying something new.  And here we are today. Happy customers and we keep coming back to enjoy original favorites and trying new things too.  They haven't disappointed us yet. Polite staff, good service (sorry but I don't like a server to gravitate over me before I have a chance to taste my food, nor do I need them checking on me with every bite -they don't ignore or avoid your table and they're not outside smoking or gabbing at a bus stations), great selection, delicious options, FAST to go -you don't need to call in if you're not opposed to waiting like five to ten minutes.  The cook is fast.  The rice is always moist and sticky.   We've done the lunch buffet and personally, I don't like buffet, but this was good.  It was later in the afternoon and she was ready to break it down but allowed us to decide if we wanted to order of the menu or eat from the buffet.  It was alright, even with it being later in the afternoon.  The Sesame Chicken was my favorite.  I had never had it before and when we ate here next it was one of the entrees we ordered.   The vegetables in each dish have been fresh and colorful.  The meats varied quite a bit based on the dish.   This place inspires me even more to try different (unusual to me) things on the menu so I always ask for both menus. I was considering the chicken and salted fish option but went with Beef Bok Sum -simple dish.  Maybe next time I'll try the fresh fish."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good compare to all the other chinese places. But the service needs work :(   Two servers are either on the computer or on their phone while we wait for the order."}
{"text":"I would have never known about this Hong Kong Chinese restaurant unless the waitress at Saigon Pho ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-pho-chandler#hrid:K7dcALr_WARav3-SqLC4LA ) hadn't recommended it! Kudos to her! We discovered that the waitress had virtually the same taste in Chinese cooking as my sister and myself! She even liked Wong's  Place ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/wongs-place-tempe#hrid:r9k_c5ki5lhCkm9wOsj8Hg ) on Baseline in Tempe. Tonight we decided on her recommendation of Hong Kong Asian Diner.  Stuffed Meat To-Fu (*** 1/2 $5.95) The most subtle tasting entree that we had this evening. We probably should not have ordered it along with the Fish Ball entree, Salty Fish Fried Rice or Singapore Vermecelli. Our fault, not the restaurant's! The flavor was very subtle. You will see a slab of Tofu cut into eight thick squares... each Tofu square is topped with a piece of Shrimp and liberally sprinkled with small Peanut chunks. Chinese Broccoli flanked the sides of the Tofu, which was immersed in a White Gravy. Nice looking presentation.  Sizzling Black Bean Sauce Fish Balls (***** $7.95) There is some problem in translation with this entree. The \"Fish Balls\" are actually Filet of Fish... not the Fish Balls you'd associate with Pho! The problem is the absolute direct translation from the Chinese lettering on the menu. The Filets are sauteed in a Black Bean Brown Gravy along with Green and Red Peppers and big chunks of Onions. We enjoyed this a lot!  Salty Fish / Chicken Fried Rice (***** $7.95) Unlike other traditional Cantonese restaurants, the Chicken is fried golden brown (before being added to the Fried Rice), along with bigger chunks of Salty Fish to create this Fried RIce! This was one of the dishes unanimously voted best of the evening! Proviso - I hesitate in recommending this Fried Rice to non-Asians, as Salty Fish is an acquired taste.  Singapore Vermecelli (***** $7.95) Hong Kong Asian Diner's innovation in this staple Egg Noodle dish is the addition of a lot of Ground Black Pepper, sprinkled profusely on top of the prepared Noodles! It seems like, even though I order this all the time, this was the first time my sister and my friend ever had Singapore Vermecelli. Singapore Vermecelli is a Egg Noodle dish fried with Barbeque Pork and Shrimp and bits of Chicken, also with Green Pepper, Eggs, and Onions, spiced with Curry. Because of the use of Curry, Singapore Vermecelli has been confused as a tropical item from the island of Singapore... when in actuality it's strictly of Chinese origin. Delicious!  Pot of Hot Tea Sliced Valencia Oranges afterwards.  Nice presentation of each entree, especially the Salty Fish Fried Rice and Singapore Vermecelli. You might have a problem with communication... as there is a definite lack of knowledge of English in this restaurant... from the translation in the menus to the wait-staff.  There are many Lunch Specials under $6... but you will be disappointed if you don't order off the strictly Chinese Menu even with the bad English translation! Attempts at being a little bit more upscale than your typical Chinese restaurant. Demographics at 9pm: 40% of capacity, 90% Oriental customers.  A definite 5-star Chinese restaurant in the Valley! Not just a Cantonese restaurant... but a Hong Kong Cantonese restaurant. Perform some research on the Internet before coming through the door."}
{"text":"A prison gives better service than this place and possibly food too.   i needed to get my stomach pumped after eating here. And you would too if you eat here, your stomach will hurt like hell!!! the soup was a disgusting glop. the rice was not fresh, the noodles were ehj...ive had better Chinese at a jack in the box. and after the horrible waitress and customer service. I DID NOT PROVIDE A TIP as i see a tip as a reflection of service and this place, lacked it all completely. well the cashier threw me the receipt, because of this, no words were exchanged, she was just pissed i did not give a tip. if i wasn't such a calm person, i would have reached over that counter and slapped her. however, this is all they get from me. a bad review and i will never think of this place again.  trust me JACK IN THE BOX has better Chinese."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome truly authentic chinese food. Oh by the way the fish tank with the huge fish are food you pick one out and they will clean it and cook it for you. Totally awesome! !!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  My favorite - Sizzling Rice Soup, Kung Pao Chicken, House Fried Rice AND the Chicken Lo Mein!!! Love the fact that it's family owned and operated and they are always super friendly... Have to give this place a try..."}
{"text":"Still awesome!! To add to your order: Hong Kong pan fried noodles, walnut shrimp, salt & pepper pork chop"}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying we went to Hong Kong Asian Diner on Christmas Eve so the restaurant was busy. We had to wait ~ 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad. A waiter brought us menus and took our drinks order, but we never saw him again. Ten minutes later, a waitress came to take our full order. About 15 minutes later, we saw her again, bringing our drinks and crab puffs, our appetizer. The crab puffs were truly delicious, but I was a bit irked about waiting so long for my Diet Coke.  A while later, our entrées emerged. I had ordered kung pao pork, which I was really looking forward to, but I got kung pao chicken instead. I wanted to eat what I had ordered, but time was short due to the lag before being served and an upcoming Christmas Eve service so I stuck with the chicken. It tasted good, but next time I'll go I'll be sure to try the kung pao pork.  Our bill was reasonably priced, actually on the inexpensive side compared to other restaurants with smaller servings and less tasty food.  We had gratis orange slices for dessert."}
{"text":"I am reviewing the dinner not the lunch. As a Hong Kong Chinese, I believe that they probably have the best Hong Kong style Chinese food in the East Valley. All this \"moo goo guy pan\" stuff isn't real Chinese food so if you expect that, then go to Panda Express but if you know what to order then I think you will enjoy. Yes, there ambiance/customer service sucks but if you went to HK then I think you would be holed in your hotel ordering in because they do the same thing. A better judgment call is to look at all the Asians in there, if you see that then that's probably a better indication; we don't care about anything other than the food. A stronger indication why most Asians don't go to PF Changs etc unless you have a gift card/coupon.   One word of caution, know your Chinese holidays!! If you go during the Mid Autumn festival or Chinese New Year, you will wait for like an hour just to be seated, so arrive early same applies for take-out as well."}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet, and went back for the dinner. Do not go for dinner in my opinion: the lunch buffet is far superior. Go early as it is small buffet."}
{"text":"Having done some research on Yelp before traveling to Phoenix for a long weekend, we were looking for a good Chinese restaurant near the airport. I was lured to this place by Mark D.'s review because he said it was in a Fry's marketplace and I was thinking he meant the electronics store (there aren't any Fry's grocery stores in NM)!! Despite the letdown of not being able to shop for electronics right after lunch, I am still a fan of this place.   We got there at the odd hour of 2:30pm but still got served with good food. I had requested crispy (both sides fried) noodles with chicken and vegetables (only the vegetarian version is listed on the menu) which was delicious. The chicken with salted fish fried rice and beef, onion and pepper rice noodles with black bean sauce was also very good. The only dish that I would not recommend is the sauteed choy sum which was par-boiled too long and a bit too soft for my liking."}
{"text":"Terrible food, all the food on the buffet was dry old and most gone and scraps left stay away"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat.. nothing great about this restaurant.. it tasted like any fast Chinese food place..they do have a lunch buffet so if you don't want to order from their menu you can do their buffet .. the waitress did check up on us quite often but it felt like she didn't want to be there.. and all the other staff were to busy eating their lunch from the buffet to help out.."}
{"text":"I have a fear of fast Chinese food. Some meals should take longer and not have a drive through. This is a sit down (or take out) restaurant that is good for your basic Chinese. The prior review was completely correct. They have two menus. One for the gringo, and the other with a completely different selection in Chinese. Staff is a little rough, but get you served right away.   They do take fish from the tank, and I would imagine that entry is on the \"hidden\" menu.   It's the right spot Saturday night after Thanksgiving and you can't take anymore leftovers."}
{"text":"Ordered the Peking Duck, snow pea leaves, chicken corn soup, salt & pepper squid.  All were decent but not particularly noteworthy.  A step above the Chinese fast food chains but not necessarily the best example of what the valley has to offer.  Bottom line, yes, I would eat here again, but would probably prefer to try something else next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with some Chinese friends.  It definitely helped that they spoke the language.  The food was terrific - we shared, beef w/fungus, fish in a delicious ginger sauce, BBQ pork, duck and the soup of the day.    It was a Saturday night, and the place was packed, but we received excellent service.  My friend simply put her arm up in the air, and a server appeared right away.    They gave us an opportunity to cancel our duck order, as it would take about 30 minutes to prepapre.  It was well worth the wait.    It will be interesting to go back, without my Chinese friends, and see if I can get good service myself."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. 0 for the service. Literally the best Mongolian beef I've ever had. However, it was also literally the worst service I've ever had. I will never eat inside the restaurant again. The waitress actually sighed out loud when I asked for some hot mustard. Never checked back after that and dropped off my bill before I even started my main dish. I watched her pick up a check from another table before they left and she asked why no tip. They pointed to the cash on the table and then picked  it up and walked out. I was blown away by how much this person hated her job. Not once did she smile or make me feel like a guest. Instead I felt as though I had been trespassing.  First time I ever stiffed a waitress."}
{"text":"Food was delicious ,had teriyaki chicken with egg soup  and sweet and sour chicken  They took time to serve and bill ,they need to have more staff to attend matters on hand"}
{"text":"Horrible selection. Only a few meet option like about 5. The egg rolls taste old. Half the food is not even hot. I bit into some chicken and it was cold. Waitress nice though. I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food I have had in phx. We randomly walked in, since we were nearby. But was a delight. We ordered chicken fried rice and yushan chicken. Was awesome. Am reducing one star for the grumpy aunt slash waitress"}
{"text":"Have been going here for about 7 years still good! Love this place! Try out the House Chicken such amazing sauce!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today,  really good food. Reminds me of my family dinners out growing up. Best Chinese I've had in az in long time. . Will be back,  owners were telling me to try the duck. . Next time!  Oh, and dont go for the buffet, and do order from the \"other\", menu!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant has been in this shopping center for years. I've eaten here about 3 times, but I will critique my latest experience as they all have been very similar. We arrived about 6 pm for dinner and there was one other couple in the place.  Seated pretty quickly, but that was the only thing fast. The service was painfully slow, from the arrival of the food to getting refills on drinks.  Considering the place was fairly empty, you'd think they'd be a little more attentive, but service is not their strong suit. The food is fresh, looks like fresh veggies.  The meat portions are small. Everything served family style so you can share. We ordered egg rolls and I wasn't impressed. They were burning hot on the outside and lukewarm on the inside, plus they really weren't that flavorful. I had the Kung pao chicken and that was a mistake. Too spicy hot for me. I'm used to the \"spicy\" food at Pei Wei, aka, not spicy.  Difficult to heat, but if you like heat then you would love it. Red chiles were abundant in the meal. Husband had the Moo Shoo pork (not sure if I spelled that correctly). It came pre assembled in 4 burrito looking type things with a side of sauce.  I forgot to mention that the egg rolls also came with a dipping sauce.  It tasted like jelly to me. Way to sweet and definitely not homemade on either sauce. The rice comes separate in a covered pot so you can portion it out as needed.  Overall, I'm not super impressed with the food and the service was not good. Prices are very average. So it's up to you if you want to give it a go. I must tell you that when you walk in you will feel like you've been transported back to 1972."}
{"text":"I love this place! If you are looking for your typical sweet and sour chicken you are not going to find it here. This is AUTHENTIC food. In fact, they have a \"whitey\" menu and a Chinese menu. Ask for the Chinese menu - the food is much better.  I always order the black pepper steak/beef and the spicy fish fillet (black bean sauce) and often the garclic bok choy.   Their soup is also wonderful!  Do not go in looking for top-notch service. The wait staff is very stand offish and it took me a while to get use to that. But, their food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation.   The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was \" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on\" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.  Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food.   Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier.   Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste..."}
{"text":"Food is good and usually consistent. Most things are authentic and well prepared. Problem is with Female owner. Think her name is Choy. Last two times we ordered, either a dish was not what we ordered or they forgot an item that is integral to our meal. When we made her aware of the error, both times, she skilfully, as she thought, changed the subject and was condescending as well as patronizing, It is so easy to say sorry and make the correction and have a satisfied customer rather than make the customer feel mad as well as stupid. Even though we really like the food, we will not go back. Too many great Asian choices in East Valley."}
{"text":"At first glance, I was skeptical. I've never had \"real\" Chinese food in a strip mall that wasn't devoted to Asian clientele. On the other hand, it was my picky Chinese family that had decided on this place. Once I stepped in the door, I realized that this restaurant seemed real enough. It even had the Chinese kid in the corner, probably the child of the restaurant owners forced to stay there because his parents were working and Chinese people don't hire babysitters (been there, done that).  They handed us the menu (Chinese apparently), and we proceeded to order. I was pleasantly surprised by the free. It was the dried bok choy kind that I don't know how to efficiently translate to English. Not that I'm a particular fan (I dislike Chinese soups), but the way it tasted exactly like the kind my mom makes at home definitely caught my attention. The meal was delicious and I definitely ate waaaay too much. Overall, very good and I hope that I get to come again."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer at this place but not anymore, starting today. This place has good food but like other reviewers, bad customer service. Most of the time, I order to go food and 99% of the time, the food was not ready by the time I pick it up, and I usually give them about 30-40 mins time to cook after I call. Today, I ordered 4 dishes at 6:30 pm and I got there about 7:45 pm, they have not started cooking anything. WTF? No apologize from any of them. In my opinion, if you are not Chinese or do not speak Mandarin/Cantonese, you can forget about being treated equally or being treated nice at all. They will prioritize Chinese people first then any other race. And if you order to go while they are busy, you should just give up and look to order somewhere else. It's shame because this place does have good food but not worth the time to wait."}
{"text":"I use to be a huge fan of this place when I was still a Sun Devil over at ASU.  Prices were good, portions were decent, and the atmosphere was lacking but oh well.  The boss lady is loud and speaks Cantonese and talking with her was always fun.  After moving away from the area, I had stopped coming here.  It was by whim that a group of us stopped in today for a late-lunch/early-dinner.  It's the same boss lady, same husband-chef, the same bland decor, and the same food.  The thing that has changed is me.  What I use to rave and crave over no longer seemed as amazing.  We got the sizzling fish fillet with black bean sauce, salt & pepper pork chops, and the seafood & tofu hot pot.  As always, the food came with a complimentary soup.  It was a bone marrow kind of soup with orange peel and beans.  In 106°F weather, I'm not sure if I should be thankful or cursing them.  The restaurant was kept warm as well so it didn't help things.  Oh well, it was free and it was tasty.  Then came a parade of food.  It was all served hot, still a decent size portion for the price, and the flavor was good.  Will my skirt flip for this place?  Probably not.  I wouldn't mind coming back but I won't be going out of my way to come here. 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Oh, before you read...I didn't come for the buffet. Why on EARTH would you want to eat food that's been sitting under heat lamps all day? The integrity of the food is going to be compromised.  Stop expecting perfection at a buffet folks; ain't gonna happen.   Back to the review:  Hong Kong Asian Diner is a little unassuming place serves nice homey Chinese Cuisine. I usually think it's a good sign when I am the only white person in an \"ethnic\" food restaurant...and both times I have eaten here, that's been the case.  They have 2 menus (like a lot of good Chinese spots do) one for traditional eaters...and one for \"Everyone else\".  I asked if I could take a look at both and was questioned \"Ohh, you LIKE Chinese Food?\" Well, yeah! That's why I'm here.  Anyway, the ladies here are super sweet, funny and attentive. Their food is also really lovely.    I had the Buddha's feast (from the traditional menu) and the Orange Chicken (yup...the everyone else menu) and I loved both! The vegetables were crisp, tasty and weren't overwhelmed by the light sauce...and the Orange Chicken...drooling...sooo good! They slice it into these strips and flash fry it. NO heavy breading, and the sauce was super sticky, sweet, and tangy.  Washed it all down with an effervescent and cheap (nice, right?) Tsing Tao while being chatted up a few times, since I was dining alone.  I really liked these ladies, and I tell ya --- Customer Service really does go along way."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my boyfriend today. The green beans, crab puffs and chow mien were good. But we had two serious issues while we were there. The first being when we asked for a straw and the waitress brought out two loose straws, not in paper protection, that she was holding in her bare hands (no offense, but I don't know where those hands have been!) and second when my boyfriend had to go ask for out check as it was time to leave me no one had come by to even ask how we were doing and the (bad enough right) and the lady standing behind the counter directly in front of the kitchen, was plucking her eyebrows. Which she immediately stopped doing when my boyfriend said \"I hate to interrupt you but can we get our check please?\" YUCK!!! I feel sick just talking about it. We will never go back here again."}
{"text":"the food is fine. my cantonese friends claim it's quite authentic actually, but the service sucks. hostesses and waitresses both quite rude and i'd rather take my money elsewhere."}
