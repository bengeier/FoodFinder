{"text":"This is my go to sushi place.  It's prices range seems to be between 10- 20 for a very nice portion of food.  The restaurant itself is not very large but clean and I even like the lighting.  Everything is made right I front of you and it's made with care(don't expect fast, but you won't be waiting forever)   If I had to point out a little downside I would say it's the generic salad  you get with most meals, the dressing is a bit much for me.    If it's your first time there take my advice and try the fire roll.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.   And it's become our local Korean and Japanese place since we discovered it back in June (Father's Day). We have returned at least once or twice per month - now more frequently since we also discovered Ruddington Park and Pokemon Go.  We usually swing by for a recharge after poke-hunting.  It's definitely a mom and pop operation, though I have yet to see Mom, I imagine she's at the back preparing the hot items, while Pop handles the sushi counter at the front and greets you with a friendly smile and wave when you enter.  Sometimes the service is slow if it's busy but the wait staff are always polite and courteous.  The food is fresh and tasty, and so far everything we've tried has been good. But we have our favorites. The sushi boat for 2 ($39.99) is quite generous and you could easily feed 3 people.  We have also tried the bento boxes and love the tempura add-on for $3.50.  The Korean menu items come with Korean side dishes like kimchi or pickles, etc.  The pork bone soup and bibimbap (hot or cold) while good needed a bit more salt and they would have been perfect.   Overall the quality of the food is good, prices are reasonable and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Ordered Spicy scallop maki, bulgogi dinner and veg tempura. Everything was very tasty, including the traditional complimentary Korean sides.  Very clean restaurant and nice service. Will come here again"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, I noticed a few mixed reviews and I just don't feel that's right (at all).  I have ordered take-out many (many) times from this place.  They are consistent, polite, and it's great quality for the price.  Not the cheapest, but if cheap is more important than quality and freshness then you may want to rethink eating raw fish!  Yes, their service could be faster but it is a family run gem and they don't compromise on quality - so yes, the prep may take longer than average but do you really want corners cut if you are eating raw fish?  Probably not.    I am really happy to have Kori in my neighborhood for a convenient Bento Box / Maki / Korean meal fix.  Let's support family run businesses in the neighborhood!    For dine-in I give 4 because service is a bit slow, but they are a fantastic take-out option and give them 5 for that."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem. Not very busy but food excellent.  We order takeout a couple times a month or occasionally eat in.  Very friendly owner.  Kalbi and rolls good portion. The hae dup bap smaller in size.  Price has gone up a bit since last year but still reasonable."}
{"text":"There's a pretty wide selection of Japanese and Korean food.  Everything was delicious and they even gave us a free salmon head!  Just be prepared to wait a bit as the service is a bit slow.  I was pretty happy that they also came around a few times to refill our teas."}
{"text":"We went to try the Korean dishes in this restaurant. Portions are smaller than their competitors but charging a little more expensive.  We went there for dinner at around 7pm, including us, only two table of customers. Well I guess this has to be a reason behind it."}
{"text":"This was the first time I came to this sushi restaurant.  We (3) ordered Chirashi Don dinner $13.99 .  It included salad, Miso soup and the bowl of Chirashi Don. The salad was fresh but not tasted good.  The Miso soup was quite above average.   For Chirashi (1) very small portion of rice , (2) The tuna was dull in color and tasted not fresh.  We told the waiter and he said they \"aged\" the tuna, a way they intentionally served.  Just worried if we would have diarrhea after eating.  (3) the fish pieces were in layers and we couldn't tell what were inside.  We also given half a teriyaki salmon head.  Not fresh and over cook."}
{"text":"My first review after using yelp for 4yrs. I got a chirachi sushi combo. The quality of Sashimi they used was amazing for a 13.99$ dinner. It includes miso and salad too. The portion was huge. Though the menu said 15pieces, I really got 20. Or maybe because it was the end of the night, the owner was nice and gave me all the rest of the Sashimi. I even got a complimentary lobster handroll.  The scallop sushi was amazing quality as well. A hidden gem right in my neighbourhood. Will be back for sure to try their Korean option"}
{"text":"A nice and quiet neighbourhood gem! The food is delicious and the service is excellent! The kids love the tonkatsu and the sushi, one of family dining out spot!"}
{"text":"Really good food! We were a party of 2 and ordered the Love Boat C. I was either really hungry or the food was really good or both. The waitress was friendly and fish was fresh and yummy! The portion is definitely good for two people. My boyfriend eats a good amount more than me and we both were very pleased at the end of our meal. Good quality and good portion. I would definitely come again!  Seems like this place isn't big (but not really small) and they didn't have many customers although I went on a weekday. They're tuck away in a little corner so it's not the easiest to spot when you're driving by. It's right at the southeast corner or Bayview and Cummer at the northeast corner of the plaza (it's south of the gas station)."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a while. I heard good things about it. Restaurant is small and tucked away in a plaza alley. Greeted with smiling faces first step in, seated and received our tea and menus immediately. Ordered a tempura appetizer that was prompt and crispy. I hate it when it's soggy and oily in the inside.  Ordered a sushi boat that was beautifully presented and a couple of hand rolls. I love how they don't use a ton of rice. It's not sushi if it's a mountain of rice. But the fish was super fresh. Also order pork cutlets.. There was a hint of curry in the breading but barely. It added nice flavour to the pork. The Don katsu sauce is my fav. Came with rice and a salad. They were just heavy on the salad sauce but I just moved it to the side. Finished off with ice cream. The black sesame is my fav."}
{"text":"Brought my family here for the first time. Both food  and service was great. We all loved the chicken Katsu that was fresh and lightly breaded. The sushi was yummy too. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in a shopping plaza in North York. This Korean-run sushi restaurant is one of my favorites in the area. While it can perhaps be a bit pricey, it's to be expected at pretty much any uptown sushi place. The price however is well worth it in my opinion, as the sushi is some of the best I've found uptown and the main dishes such at the katsu donburi have all been delicious. If you're in the area, I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food taste, presentation, and service. Ordered my Kimchi Jjigae while having a sushi entre alongside the typical Korean side dishes. Cook timing was perfect. The Sushi taste was probably the best I've ever had in Toronto. I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to go to the nearest Korean restaurant - I had some serious cravings, and found this little place tucked away in the corner of the plaza. We got the lunch specials, which offer large portions at reasonable prices. I got the DdukBaeGi bulgogi, which came bubbling in a big stone pot with heaps of beef, rice cakes, and glass noodles ($12.99). Our meals came with complementary deep fried tofu, gyoza, and some korean side dishes. Service was impeccable - everyone working there was so friendly!! To top it all off, they gave us free Yakult as dessert. We had such an amazing experience here and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Food is fresh and comes in good portions. It has both Japanese and Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Great place tucked in the corner of the Bayview plaza. Our waitress was nice and prompt. I had a yummy katsudon (pork cutlet bowl) and boyfriend had some spicy salmon rolls. Both came with miso soup and salad. The katsudon was sooo yum. The crisp on the skin was just right and it was such a generous portion that I was struggling to finish off the entire bowl. My boyfriend's sushi was small (compared to Sushi Bong) but they give you like 18 pieces, so he was more than satsified. They even gave us a few cubes of cantaloupe to share as we paid the bill.  We shall definitely come back!  P.s. Great music choices! Disney's Lava You song, Tori Kelly and Norah Jones :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese restuarant I've ever tried in Toronto. The only problem is the guy waiter gives you the bill without asking for the bill. I find it rude and i felt I'm being rush to leave. They are very good with customer service skills it's like you gotta keep tipping them for it. When you order salmon teriyaki it is usually a big piece of salmon. They also have lunch and dinner specials :) Washrooms are clean and spacious. The background music are English so don't expect Japanese/Korean music when you eat here."}
{"text":"Great sushi and Korean food. Shared a sushi boat and had the beef bulgogi. Great portions and nice staff.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome, tasty food! Chicken katsu was particularly good!"}
{"text":"After having an incredibly successful year in almost all aspects of life (career, personal, financial), I spontaneously felt like going out somewhere to help myself to a huge portion of sushi.  Pros: -Not crowded -Price reasonable for quality of food served -Polite service Given good seat Server checked up on me Chef checked up on me Table kept clear Thanked upon leaving   Cons: -Felt rushed being handed bill immediately upon finishing food, not asked if wanted dessert or drink, or given time to digest (I was the only one in the entire restaurant).  It doesn't help that that night, I was specifically looking for a dining experience where I can take my time to enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"under new management, kori has great options for both Korean and Japanese food. the food quality has improved, with excellent service. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Visited Dec 3 for dinner.  A hidden gem in the Bayview/Finch area, it was half-empty when we visited.   Pros Lots of free parking in the strip mall.  Nice and quiet restaurant, if you're looking for this kind of environment.  Kaisho Salad - Fresh no issues.  Golden Dragon Roll - Flavourful and fresh. no complaints about the rice it smelled like sushi rice to me.  Spicy Roll combo - Delicious!  Cons  Brown rice surcharge 50 cents per roll! Paid $2.50 in rice :( Brown rice should just be an option for guests, don't people know that brown rice is healthier than white rice.  At the time it was very cold since they don't have a storm door.  Odd name, not sure what Kori means. The dividers looked a bit ghetto.   Protip - Once per day usually, the restaurant offers a fried fish-head special. This is an off-menu item that the chef offers to customers. Normally I wouldn't care to eat the fish head, but they deep fried it so it was crispy. A surprise and highlight of our meal!  Damage $40 (tax included)"}
{"text":"3.5* Overview: decent sushi for the price!   Restaurant was hidden in the plaza which was probably the reason only two other tables were taken when we arrived.  Staff was nice and greeted us as we entered.  We ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box replacing the California roll with unagi roll and spicy sushi set. Seems like a small family restaurant and they had discussion determining the difference when replacing the roll. The bento box and set comes with miso soup and salad.  The miso soup was just ok, tasted more like plain beef broth with hint of miso. Salad dressing on the dressing was nice,  not too salty.  Again not really miso.  For the prices paid,  we got a good amount of food!  The rolls were standard with the spicy being a sauce put on top.  Aside from that the sushi was fresh and tasty.  The bento box was decently sized,  with the tempura portion coming with two shrimps and five pieces if decent sized vegetables! This was in top of the chicken teriyaki,  rive,  roll,  and salad. The unagi roll was also very good.  Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it had decent reviews but the experience was just average. The restaurant was hidden in a corner plaza so it's not in a visible location.  The restaurant is cute with traditional Japanese style table and decor.  Service: it was quick and efficient but found it hard to communicate with our server as it took them several times to ask for more ginger and wasabi  FOOD: The sashimi was fresh however cut a too thick making it a mouthful to eat. The sushi rice was too soft and mushy, definitely didn't taste like Japanese rice. The tempura tasted like leftovers, was probably reheated because it taste fresh.   Overall, I don't think i will come here again but hey you get what you pay for...price was cheaper than most places."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday but the place was empty. I got the udon soup so I can't comment much about the sushi, but it was pretty average. The salad it came with was fresh though and I liked the dressing. This place is located in a small plaza and it seemed kinda dead and empty. I would still come back to try the sushi and bento though."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch this afternoon. Note that their lunch special applies to weekdays only.    Our server was very attentive. The menu was a good mix between Korean and Japanese. Prices were fair.  I got the nigiri combo - the combo came with a great selection of different sushis. The sashimi's were cut in the right thickness. However, the sushi rice was falling apart. I also had a funny tummy after the meal (if you know what I mean).   They need to improve on the freshness of their food.   I might return after seeing better reviews in a couple of month just because it's close to me."}
{"text":"I think I've officially found my new favorite place to go to if I'm craving BOTH Japanese and Korean food! Granted, I don't exactly know many restaurants with this mixture, but I had a great evening here. I was feeling really hungry on my way home from the Yonge and Finch area and decided to go on Yelp to see what restaurants were close by. Kori Sushi caught my eye, so I thought why not? Took a bit to find this place, as it is literally hidden in the corner of a plaza, so keep your eye out! It's a small family restaurant - casual/cozy atmosphere, good for groups (seats are comfy!), and average noise level.  The menu was a little overwhelming with the wide variety of dishes to choose from. The prices were regular and fair. We could not seem to make up our minds on what to order between Sushi, Katsu, Noodles, Donburi, or Korean food... Everything sounded appealing! Final verdict: Love Boat C and Tonkatsu... Just Japanese for today. Our server was kind, soft-spoken, and easy to talk to. She even let us substitute the Golden Dragon Roll for the Caterpillar Roll in our Love Boat order! And they really did look like Caterpillars with all of that AVOCADO! Sashimi was thick and fresh, rolls were delicious (they didn't stand out too much though, I just really like Sushi), and the pork tonkatsu was crisp with an appetizing sauce all over it that just melts in your mouth.   The presentation of the boat was my favorite part. It had a lovely look to it, with everything neatly and carefully placed. A random lady even came up to us as she was about to leave the restaurant just to let us know how scrumptious and attractive it looked. I agree with you, girl!!   Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience here and I would not hesitate to come back. I definitely want to try out some of the Korean dishes next time. My only mistake today was ordering more than I could handle - Love Boat C would have sufficed on its own for 2 people. We ended up packing a lot of things up to take home, but hey, I'm not complaining... It's another meal for me later on tonight!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and sashimi. Delicious Korean dishes. Good customer service. Nice location with plenty of parking space available."}
{"text":"Came here with 5 friends for dinner on a Saturday at 7pm.  Was about 50% full.  One of my friends had a coupon for 10% off and suggested for us to try it.  The menu had many Japanese and Korean options.  I decided to get the sashimi donburi $12.99 which was bit size mixed sashimi on salad mixed with rice.  Flavours were good and portion size was decent.  It also came with miso soup and regular salad.  Like most korean restaurants they included side dishes with the meal such as Kim chi, fish cakes, sprouts, and potatoes.  If that isn't enough food they also gave us complimentary dumplings and mushroom sushi to sample.  Will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Delicious, great prices for the quality of food they provide. I don't think I've ever had such fresh ingredients as they have here...The vegetables retain they're yummy fresh garden taste in their salads and their sushi has a great flavour profile....not just simple sushi, they all have an extra pop of flavour. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi in a small friendly restaurant.  My daughter typically goes to AYCE restos but I like better quality. Kori had wonderful fresh fish. We had sushi 1 combo, black & white roll, spicy scallop roll. All was tasty. Expensive but worth it"}
{"text":"Looks like a family owned restaurant. Koreans doing Japanese and Korean food. Father prepares sushi, mother prepares the cooked food and daughter as cashier/waitress. The daughter was working so hard since she was the only waitress. She was running up and down the place doing this and that with no time to rest. Even though the place was not too busy during lunch on a Saturday the waitress still had lots to do. Service was great.  Opted for the Korean food  Pork bone soup $8.99 - soup was great and not overly salty. The was a lot of pork bone but sadly mine had very little meat. Not really their fault as there were 4 large pork bones in my soup. Must have been a skinny cow :)  Mondoo Guk $8.99 - had sliced rice cakes, some seafood and dumplings in soup. No complaints here. Everything tasted great.  Side dishes (green beans, bean sprouts, kimchii) - not too happy with the side dish options."}
{"text":"Average at most.  We ordered two things:  1) Sashimi Combo ($15.99) - The most disappointing thing about this was that they just give you WHITE RICE when it is supposed to come with SUSHI RICE (mixed the rice vinegar). Sashimi was standard pieces of raw fish, sliced on the smaller end.  2) Pork Bone Soup ($9.99) - Blaaaaaand. This is the clearest pork bone soup I have ever had.  I'm giving an extra star for their delicious small dishes. The spinach was ON POINT and the kimchi was fantastic.  The only gave us one soup which I can understand since there was a pork bone soup order, but they also only gave us one salad which is your standard low cost iceberg lettuce. Pfft.  I can't say I wouldn't recommend this place based on only the two items we tried out of their whole menu. But we most likely we would not return. Based on their 4 stars on Yelp, we were pretty disappointed especially when we ordered pretty \"safe\" choices."}
{"text":"The good: hmm...  The bad: I ordered takeout from this place. I had the spicy tuna. It's.... stale. The sauce itself was alright, but somehow it's either the fried tempura dough or the tuna itself that tasted really old.  The ugly: the prices definitely do not justify its taste. And definitely felt the MSG after eating the udon (had the chicken udon)  Neutral: it's probably the best sushi place around the area.... since there are none around the area. It's good place for family or groups since there is ample of space. But if you have other food choices to go to and aren't limited by location, then I would suggest another Japanese bento/sushi place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly (weekly at least) for take out and the food is great. Staff are very friendly and suslhi is made very well and tasty. Dynamite combo comes with the roll + sushi + salad and soup."}
{"text":"The restaurant has terrible service. We should have left when sitting for 10 min but nobody came to take the order and at the time there was only 3 tables of customers including us. We ordered an appetizer and sushi to share and 3 main dishes. It took another 30 min for our main dishes to come with no sign of appetizer or sushi, while in the mean time we were left alone with empty glasses. My husband had to go to the counter to inquire the rice and soup that were supposed to come with the main dish since the two waitresses didn't respond to either eye contact, a raising hand or \"excuse me\". I noticed there was a plate of green dragon roll sitting on the sushi counter while we're waiting for our food. When the waitress finally brought it to our table, my patience and politeness had run out. I told her since the sushi had been sitting there for over 15 min with flies hovering over, unless they made fresh ones we didn't  want it anymore. She did take it away but we had to \"remind\" her to take it off from the bill. My husband did leave 15% tips but if tips are  reflection of service then they deserved none. Overall the food was okay. But does it worth the terrible service? Absolutely not. They should hire people who actually know how to wait the table and manage a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for take out just now and I was amazed. Although there was no one in the restaurant, the chef was making our order on the spot and I can tell he really poured his heart into it.  The girl who took my order was young and really really friendly. I found the prices really fair and less pricey than most sushi places.   I ordered the caterpillar roll and spicy salmon roll and the tonkatsu combo.  Caterpillar roll is definitely growing in me. It's delicious!!!!! And the fact is, their rolls don't use as much sushi rice as other places do. So its more ingredient than the rice. Tonkatsu was dressed in breading and topped with a drizzle of honey mustard, mayo and teriyaki sauce. Absolutely delicious.  I honestly would come here to try the maki sets next time because they were so affordable. 18 piece maki set costs $13.99. Spicy salmon roll was $5.50. Caterpillar roll was $11.99. Tonkatsu was $10.99."}
{"text":"Tried this sushi place out on a Sunday cause our favourite place (Sushi Bong) was closed. I'm glad we found this li'l gem.  The price was reasonable for what you get. I ordered a salmon lover special, but I expect they gave me a few extra pieces than the menu advertised. Needless to say I was chuffed to bits by the surprise extra sushi. Then the host delivered us complimentary fried dumplings which was another nice surprise. But they weren't done impressing us yet! When the bill came, they brought us little Korean yogurt beverages which I think was called \"Yakult,\" which I wasn't in love with but still very happily accepted.  It seemed like a family run business and everyone was very attentive. I would love to see if they treat all their customers as well as they treated us."}
{"text":"I recently tried Kori Sushi takeout based on Yelp recommendations and have to say I had a great experience.   The restaurant was rather quiet on a  Tuesday night but we found the fish and other ingredients to be very fresh. You will find your typical range of rolls here with nothing really new as far as the Japanese options are concerned. The menu does feature some Korean dishes which is a nice touch. There is a discount for takeout and we found the service to be quite friendly.   Overall, a great addition to an area which badly needed a decent sushi joint. This place would be packed if the Yonge St. crowd knew about it!"}
{"text":"There was about 8 of us so we ordered the Large Sashimi boat. The prices were very reasonable compared to other a la carte sushi restaurants. The sashimi is fresh and you can taste the difference from an AYCE restaurant. I do wish there was a little more variety however (lots of salmon sashimi). We ordered a few of the cooked dishes, and they were ok. The bibimbap was disappointing. We were expecting a mixed rice dish in a hot stone pot but it was served in a regular bowl instead. The service was attentive and genuine and they even gave us a plate of complementary salmon head (Yumm!)"}
{"text":"2.5 star  Kori Sushi is a small family restaurant that serves both Japanese and Korean dishes.  Hidden at the corner, you will not even see the restaurant storefront when you drive by. I knew exactly where it is since I been to the traditional Korean restaurant that used to be here.  Lunch Sspecial till 4 pm on Weekdays.  Sushi Lunch Large ($11.99)  -  8 pieces of Nirgri Sushi with 4 being Salmon, wish there more variety.  - California roll has a nice crunch  - Shari rice though not Japanese rice was well prepared with nice bite and good seasoning - no wasabi in sushi  Overall experience is average. Not good enough for me to want to go back.  Maybe Korean dishes tastes better?   Service though nice and friendly and seems to doing well with takeout."}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing staff and yummy food. Recommend coming here; everyone was very welcoming."}
{"text":"Thank god for uber eats when you're craving sushi and there's nothing within walking distance. Thought I would try something new in the neighbourhood for the new year. Got the kori roll combo (rainbow roll, dynamite roll, California roll) - cut was fresh and tasty, the salad that comes with was amazing, and the portion was so worth for $17. I'd definitely go check out the restaurant sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Live just down Bayview from this place, and so far since being back from school I have been here at least once every week for the past month or two. The spot has always had good restaurants but none have ever held on for more than a few years, hopefully this place stays for good. Great service with friendly staff, and for the sushi component you can see yourself the preparation that goes into it as well as the large pieces of fish that are cut up for your meal.  The sushi is well done and fresh, japanese dishes are plentiful and very tasty, and the korean menu is equally good. I have to say I am experienced and spoiled with good food having been raised on asian cuisines, and this place is certainly becoming a favorite (if not already).  I recommend the rainbow roll, tambura udon (noodle soup with assorted tempura on the side), the kimchi jigae, lunch combination, and chirachi."}
