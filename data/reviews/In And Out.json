{"text":"One of many experiences. Feel free to think outside the box and make your own burger.  It would be amazing.  Footer the number of workers on a wednesday, I expected a little faster service. However in Phoenix, the weather was nice enough we were able to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Up to expected standards.  Great deal for cheap.  Service with a smile and facilities were fairly clean.  Best of all they took credit cards.  Must be something new.  In California seems like it's a cash only joint.   Great to see this chain in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love this place, love the burgers and they always hire great employees who care about customers and about their jobs!"}
