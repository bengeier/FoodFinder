{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for about two years. Just recently it became under a new owner. I food has gone down hill and the new paint in the restaurant is horrible."}
{"text":"We decided to go back to the Concord area and give a couple sushi places another try. Miso is a tiny place with a tiny sushi bar. There's something about the smell in here, not that its bad mind you, but it smells like a sub shop. Anyway, once again the staff was very friendly and the rolls were extremely good and big. We shared an appetizer of tuna salad with chips in it home made from wonton, suprisingly yummy, while we waited for our rolls. We ordered the Lambada & Big Mama rolls, big fresh and yummy. Buy one get one 1/2 price. Considering the area, these are great rolls at a great price. The atmosphere is unlike most sushi places, but the rolls are better than most around here. Still a solid 3.5 stars...."}
{"text":"We tried this awful restaurant late afternoon 4/19/14.  My husband and I shared four different types of sushi rolls.  They had too much wet, tasteless rice.  The other ingredients were not fresh tasting/looking.  I asked for more ginger and was charged an additional 50 cents without being told it would cost extra.  The menu does not list an extra charge for 3 pieces of additional ginger.  I also order the seaweed salad ($3.99).  The serving was very small (about 1/3 cup) and served over iceberg lettuce in a plastic cocktail glass.  Most sushi restaurants serve it over cucumber slices.  My husband tried the pan fried pork Gyoza (5 pieces for $3.99).  They were actually deep fried and greasy.  Don't waste your time or money going to this place.  Try My Bento Box on HWY 49 in the University area."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and delicious. They run a special all day, every day: buy 1, get one half off equal or lesser value. Still a bit on the expensive sude, but it was very good."}
{"text":"Quick and nice service. Kind of tucked away makes you not want to venture here but it's a decent sushi place and their teriyaki chicken is pretty good. Good stop if you're hangry and convenient because there aren't too many other choices nearby."}
{"text":"You know it's not a good sign when you walk in at 1pm on a Friday and you're the only one there. I got the hand roll I ordered first. Of note, I asked that they make my California Hand Roll spicy. She was very confused. \"Like with jalepeno or with Sri Racha?\" I said yeah, maybe a little Sri Racha. She told me that'll be 50Â¢. Um. Ok. Then I had to ask them to come back and give me chopsticks and a soy sauce bowl. Eek. Then I got my Bagel Roll and the Dynamite Roll. Both were ok at best. Just....meh.   This place is kinda like being in an airport and deciding sushi sounds good, but after you get the sushi you're like \"no wonder the line a Burger King was so long \""}
{"text":"Soooo....I was craving some Japanese food for lunch today, specifically hibachi rice and vegetables, so I decided to check out Miso Sushi & Grill....  Now, I'm thinking that was a MISTAKE.  Warning for those who live and work in Concord---if you're a hearty eater like myself, you will be Most disappointed by Miso!  Although the food was timely and the customer service was good, the food tastes average, and the portions were TINY!!  My 8 year old son could have handled that with ease!  I was really hungry so I snapped up that plate in no time, but I needed more....so I ended up grabbing a pack of cheez its from the vending machine.  SMH!  And then they have the nerve to throw in a cup of soup, which was good, but the point is, keep the soup in your back pocket and give me another scoop of rice!  Why are my standards so high?  Well, because I'm accustomed to getting my Japanese food from awesome places like Toyoma Express in Charlotte (check this place out!) where I would have paid LESS and gotten MUCH more. Synopsis:  Miso struck out on the very first try, and I'm not going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place today. We've been in Concord in over 2 years and not seen this place. We both got a bagel roll and it was incredible. We didn't eat anything else because of time. I can't wait to try other things."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.   It started w the Miso soup that was very very salty and tasted more like chicken broth.   My order came and was wrong. I had ordered a spicy yellowtail roll and got a tuna roll. The salmon and tuna were subpar with no taste (sashimi). They did not have Ikura , that I ordered originally. So I asked for Flying Fish Roe.  When that came out, there was hardly an roe on the rice.........and one was FROZEN.  the yellowtail roll had the spicy mayo on the outside and it was too much..........and the yellowtail was awful. I ate 2 pieces.    This was not a good first impression and I can easily say I will never go back. It was one of the worst, if not the worst, sushi experiences ever..........."}
{"text":"I love sushi! There was only one other couple in the whole place and the food took quite a bit of time but we weren't in a hurry.  Food was great but make sure you don't have a time limit on when u need to get out of there."}
{"text":"I will give them two stars because we didn't even get to eat anything. Being from New York I know good sushi My husband and I went to have lunch like another person stated it was lunch time and the place was empty. We came in and the place smelled like mildew and bleach like someone had mopped with a dirty mop. We sat down and the tables were so sticky I asked the young lady if they had any lunch specials and she said no only special they had was 8.99 for half a roll and soup.  Just a suggestion to draw in customers  #1clean that place up.  #2 get some more specials # one thing in serving the public is the customer wants to feel like they got the most for their money!"}
{"text":"Tiny little restaurant but it was so good! Definitely one of the best around concord! We stopped in for a quick lunch we received fast friendly service with a great quality of food! I will definitely be back here for seconds!"}
