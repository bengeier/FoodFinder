{"text":"Love the dim reddish lighting and soft African beats, makes a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  Definitely BYOB to pass the waiting time,  we were. The first to arrive so it took about 45 minutes to get our food. We ordered #23 mixed veg combo and #14 Ye Beg Tibbs cubes of lean lamb in a delicious perfectly spiced sauce.   The injera was freshly made on the spot,  soft and just enough sourness (it's fermented like sourdough is). 

A mix of veg is a good start as you get a variety of lovely flavours, lentils,  spinach, potato.   The Lamb was perfectly spicy for us so if you can't take any heat ask the owner if he can tone it down. 

Owner told me that weekends are 25% off so we might be coming again before we leave."}
{"text":"Many years ago, there was a wonderful little Ethiopean restaurant in NDG. Sad day when it closed down. So when East Africa appeared a few years ago, it was a happy day.

It was an even happier day when we went to eat there. The food is excellent, just as good as the old place that I still miss. If you like Ethiopean food, East Africa will not disappoint.

A word of warning: this is a classic mom and pop restaurant. Pop takes the orders and mom cooks them. Do not expect fast service. If you want fast food, try elsewhere. Also, I doubt this is the place to go with groups larger than four."}
{"text":"delicious! 
intense flavours that leave the mouth watering for more!
it is a small resto, seating no more than 14 at a time so make sure you take reservations.
husband seats and serves you while the wife cooks in the back, therefore if it is a packed night you will be waiting quite some time for your dish but believe me it is worth the wait.
reasonably priced as well
byow just adds to the experience"}
{"text":"This place is a low-key, neighbourhood restaurant that serves up delicious home-cooked Ethiopian food in satisfying portions. It's well worth a try.  For people with allergies or who do not eat animal products, I noted that most dishes are prepared without dairy and many would be vegan-friendly.

As other reviewers have noted, the time to receive your order is slower than average, but this is not problematic if it is your expectation. Several other people noted that it is a BYOB but I did not see a license. It would be best to confirm. I would also recommend reservations for busier nights.

After coming here twice I have two tips: 1. The vegetarian platter is a great bang for your buck (although you're missing out on some nice salads that are also available.) 2. Take home leftovers!  The portions are very filling."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian combo (about 3-4 variations of lentils, potatoes and green beans, and a cucumber salad with sliced jalapeno pepper) and this review is commenting on this specific dish which I have compared to other Ethiopian restaurants I have been to. For those who are looking for a quality meal with appropriate range and use of ingredients and spices, freshness and flavour (including spiciness) then you would enjoy the food here.

The decor is simple and there is, as other reviewers note, a very long wait. It took almost an hour for my single order to arrive. However, you could tell that certain dishes were being made to order and had a very home-cooked feel making the meal very satisfying. 

What I like particularly about this restaurant is their Injera bread. Other restaurants I have been to in other cities seem to use seemingly store bought bread which is quite porous. But the bread here which they generously provide you with is lighter, you actually see them make it, and doesn't have as strong sour taste which I personally liked.

I recommend this restaurant if you want to hang out with friends, or on a date and don't mind spending some time with your company while waiting for your meal. But not if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:10 pm. It is now 8:45 pm. The restaurant is packed. As I write 2 people who arrived after us are eating. A previous reviewer noted that  a party of two could expect a 1 hour plus wait. A party of 7  was in the restaurant prior to us. We were served at 8:50 pm. The food was wonderful but the wait was far too long. This is a 2 person operation. They were attempting to cater to 24 people. Mission impossible. 
Unless I can order prior to my arrival, I will not return.

{"text":"Bring a bottle of wine because you will wait an hour for the food.  The service is atrocious.  But the food makes up for it all the way."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this restaurant for lunch (it's not usually open at this time, but the owners are thinking about opening during the day) and it was frankly one of the best experiences we have ever had.

The mom lit up candles and incense, which made the ambiance absolutely marvelous, and the pop came to talk to us about Ethiopian culture and how every meal they make is made with 100% traditional ingredients, all imported from their home country. They then proceeded to roast the coffee (then green) in front of our eyes right after they gave us our main meal, a sort of spicy breakfast that I still dream about at night and crave.

The meal and coffee were absolutely delicious, and it would be great if more people called or shared their opinion to make lunch a regular thing at East Africa, as it was a great experience. Even though you have to call beforehand to reserve a place there, the meal and conversations are totally worth it.

Without a doubt the best restaurant of its kind in Montreal, definitely worth your time"}
{"text":"Super charming little spot in NDG. Flavorful and delicious!
Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"As others have stated, the food was absolutely delicious ! I do not have any complaints, everything was great and the flavors were top notch. However, the wait was tremendously long. We waited 1 hour for our food. It was kind of worth it cause the food was excellent but even then, an hour is far too much. If it wasn't for that, I would have given the place 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food ok. Customer service horrible. Will not be returning.

Group of 6. Ordered 1 salad right away - took 40min to arrive. (40min for a salad?!!) Ordered mains within 15min of arrival - took 2 hours  (I am not exaggerating) to arrive. Yes, resto was full but that's only 15 people! 
The gentleman serving clearly doesn't give a flying fig about customer experience. The wife's cooking is decent.
During our dinner, the next table were a couple with 2 kids. We saw them bring dinner for the kids in tupperware containers which the kids ate while waiting for food to arrive. They also brought toys and books for the kids. So, the long wait seems not to be unique to us.

Previously we had tried calling on 3 different occasions over the course of 7 months to order pick up... but the gentleman just picks up and says today we are closed. Unprofessional.

Do not go to East Africa if hungry - you will grow old before your food arrives."}
{"text":"OK so this is not really a restaurant... It's not really run like a business, per se. And yet it's AMAZING. 

A delightful couple will serve you a to-die-for-delicious home-cooked meal that you just happen to pay for... They prepare everything once it's ordered so there's no scaling or volume or time-saving like you'd expect from a standard \"restaurant.\" 

Consequently, expect to wait at least an hour, in bigger groups closer to two+ hours, for your order. But it's worth it!!! (If you know to expect that). The food is stunning, it's truly home-cooked, and you can really taste the difference. My absolute favorite mom and pop joint in Montreal, hands down.

If you want to go to a \"restaurant\" that's run like a business, that's got the semblance of decor, a reasonable wait time and serves Ethiopian food: go to The Blue Nile. If you want to go to a place that is the real deal, this is it: I lived in Addis Ababa for two years so I know a good Kitfo, and it's the only place I'll take others who lived there for dinner. It has soul, they serve the BEST Ethiopian food in Montreal, and you'll be supporting a local, family-owned gem. I remember Au Messob d'Or, Abiata and the old place on Bishop so I've seen Ethiopian places come and go in this city. I'm so glad East Africa has been thriving, as I'd hate to lose such an authentic spot.

It's all delicious, but my favourite dishes, in order of preference are:

- The Kitfo (beef tartar - although I ask for it very lightly cooked)
- The Fish
- The mixed vegetarian platter
- Lamb Tibbs
- Doro Wat (chicken & egg)

You will probably need to ask for extra injera (the bread) if you're in a bigger group. My general rule of thumb is 1.5 dishes per person (or 2 if there are lotsa people with big appetites) and bear in mind the vegetarian platter counts as 2 dishes in servings. So I'd say order 3ish dishes if you're 2 people, 6-7 if you're 4, and so on. If you have smaller appetites I know couples that just share the vegetarian platter between them, but I could never ignore my other favorites! 

I've been countless times over the years, and I often go in groups of 8 - 12 people (because Ethiopian food is the best to share!) All of my friends are basically regulars now, it's just that kinda magical place. I do \"brief\" people before I bring them here, thusly:

- Have a snack before you go, we will wait 2+ hours as a large group.
- Bring whatever you want to drink: it's not just BYOB, they only have water so if you want wine, beer or even soda/juice you have to bring it.
- The decor and bathroom are... rustic :)
- The food itself is OUTSTANDING.   
- The family running East Africa are awesome, kind, genuine, hard-working peeps. 

I often order the food for group outings the night before or when I make my reservation. This has no impact on the serving wait times (LOL) but it does generally help ensure they may have the things we want to order in stock (not a guarantee though, again: LOL).

Note that people I know who are less used to spicy food (think proper middle eastern, Indian,  etc., not tamed versions) tend to find the Kitfo a bit spicy, and sometimes other dishes as well, so do let them know if you want it toned down. But for those of you who love spicy food, you'll be in heaven! You can even ask for a little extra berbere on the side if you want even more kick :) 

Bring friends, lots to drink, plan to spend a good few laid back hours there: you'll eat well and have a blast!!!"}
{"text":"We just came back from this place tonight. We really enjoyed our dinner at this tiny Ethiopian restaurant. The food was full of flavour. They offered extra Injera for no extra charge. We had the veggie combo and a lamb dish which turned out to be a little too much food for us- we are stuffed right now! And the cost, $31 including tax! It was really reasonable for the huge portion we got. 

The 2 staff were so nice. Food came out fast and we were impressed with the quality of it. We will be back!

Disclaimers and other notes: Decor is basic, but it seems like they have outdoor seating. We would have taken it, but it's too cold tonight. They did not really have dessert options and there is no alcohol, so you may want to opt to plan drinks/sweets into your evening outside the main meal. This is not food that poeple eat with utensils- A lady near our table suggested many times to the owner that they MUST get forks. And when he tried to explain his cultural tradition. She was all: Ya, but you really need FORKS. It was kind of hilarious. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"To me, what makes or breaks an Ethiopian restaurant is their Kitfo - their version of steak tartar. It's what keeps me coming back; that primal toothiness of raw beef thoroughly blended with spiced butter into a harmonious whole. I always look forward to the feeling of the fragrant butter coating my lips, the sensuousness of it makes me all dreamy.

This night however, was a complete bust. 

Me and the Missus both know that service was very slow here. We've eaten here on over ten occasions and have always made allowances because we know that the cooking starts after you put in your order and that the food is worth the hour wait. 

Tonight, not so much. 
Despite being the second couple in the place and having placed our order immediately we didn't see service for one hour and forty five minutes. Our bottle of (BYO) wine barely survived the wait and it was only with grim determination that we we able to reserve the last quarter for meal.

When the meal (beautiful as ever) was set down in front of us were were almost manic with glee!  

I tore off a soggy piece of injera, scooped up a dollop of the piece de resistance and wrapped my taste buds around a violently over-salted, over-cooked tartar. 

Let me repeat that for you:  Over.  Cooked.  Tartar.  :-/

The rest of our order was okay-ish."}
{"text":"A small hole-in-the-wall restaurant run by a couple. As other Yelpers have noted, service is slow but worth it. The food is delicious. Be warned that sometimes they improvise with ingredients and dishes may not fit the description in the menu. Portions vary too. It's helpful to call in advance to place the order."}
{"text":"This isn't a review of how the food is. We didn't get to try the food because I called to order take out at 7:50 pm, 2+ hours before closing, and was told that they could not take an order for food over the phone after 4 pm because the customers that are there at the restaurant will be upset and complain if they see someone come in and pick up food without having waited \"in line\" to get the food. What on earth?! I explained to the gentleman on the phone that we had spent the entire day in the ICU where a family member is being treated and we have a 6 month old baby and are exhausted and would just like some nice Ethiopian food to take home. He said we could come and order there and sit at a table and wait for it. Wtf?!"}
{"text":"Year ago there was a small Ethiopian place in Monkland Village called Messop D'Or; I literally mourned the day it closed. So, I was very excited when East Africa came highly recommended by a friend that also loved Messop D'Or. They were right! 

East Africa has absolutely delicious food! The Ingera is perfect, the berber dishes are spicy and savoury, and the vegetarian plates are just plain yummy! I am a huge fan of East Africa now. It is BYOB and you can bring any drink you like (wine, beer, soda). 

The people that own the place are kind and genuine. You get the feeling that you are invited guests at someone's home; The small size of the restaurant adds to the charm (you are in the same room as the chef).

I have two pieces of advice for anyone who would like to dine there: 
1) Make reservations (the place is not big, and they have lots of fans)!
2) Give yourselves LOTS OF TIME, this is not the type of restaurant that you are in and out of. The food takes time to prepare, and there is one person working the kitchen! Go with people that you enjoy to converse with, then have a delicious and authentic meal!"}
{"text":"Food was good and relatively inexpensive, for the amount you get. Doesn't quite match up to the now closed Messob d'Or on Monkland, but I'd take this place over the overpriced Nil Bleu any day.

Service can be SLOW. I would strongly advice ordering in advance: go for the veg combo plus as many meat dishes as you have additional people (4 people = 1 veg + 3 meat). A table of 3 ordered just before us, a table of 4, and we received our food 50 and 65 minutes after ordering: not a pleasant wait on water alone. 

Sadly, if you want any sort or service aside from ordering, you have to go to the counter to get anyone's attention.

All that being said, I'd still go back."}
{"text":"Always the best food on earth! These are some of my favourite things ever!!! I'd eat this cuisine everyday for the rest of my life if I could. Absolutely worth the wait. I need a one-way ticket to Addis Abeba and Mulatu Astatke and I are gonna eat and listen to Yekermo Saw on repeat. The Lion of Zion ! blessing of the Almighty unto thee ! in the name of the One and celestial. 

Legend has it that the fabled lost Ark of the Covenant is in Ethiopia and with one bite ... it'll be all up in your mouth! Seriously, you will be talking directly to G-d her/him/it -self when you eat this food. As you saunter into the deliciously holy temple that is East Africa Restaurant you'll be ensconced in a warming red glow and a most enchanting scent which will undoubtedly transport you to a faraway spice market somewhere along the Eastern Rift Valley at the cradle of civilisation in the Horn of Africa. We are all African. We all come from Africa. Our ancestors were all borne into being ... right here in Africa. As you take your seat you will melt through space and time. This is the culminating point of the Spice Route. This is the terminus of the spice trade. This is where all things delicious come to be eaten. This is the sanctum sanctorum; the holy of holies, where the magic happens. Ethiopian cuisine is probably my favourite food in the entire world. This is an historic account of true fusion; ancient fusion. This is where spices from the four corners of the world reach their scrumptious confluence. This is the meeting point of global flavour. The amazing Jewish Ethiopian/Eritrean mom and pop dynamic duo who run the show here are some of the best people in the world and they are the proverbial mom and pop of all humanity. Mmmm scrumptious and delectable humanity. I always order my vegetarian platter. This comes with a beautiful stew of root vegetables like carrots, potatoes and turnips simmered to perfection in a sort of \"curry\" sauce. There are also two kinds of lentils on this platter; one oh so sumptuously flavoured savoury version and a more piquant spiced version. There is a beautiful tomato salad that'll knock your socks off. Then the spinach; I don't know what they do to that spinach but it's the best I've ever tasted. All of this is served on a pillowy soft and spongy sourdough-leavened flatbread called Injera; somewhat similar to a crêpe. You absolutely must order the beetroot salad; you've never had beets like this before. They also make a special Ethiopian cheese but if you're a keener you'll order it a day in advance because it goes fast. Finish your meal with Ethiopian tea or coffee. This is the best coffee you'll have at any restaurant like this. The tea is beautifully flavoured with a delicious and special African cinnamon. Wow, you can almost see the ancient ruins of Lalibela in the distance. Is that a civet stalking some prey? No, is it a gazelle or kudu? Yes, folks, rediscover your African roots here; you'll remember your ancient heritage with that first mouthful of glory and it only gets better. Humans became human beings in Africa and through Africa we will once again rediscover our humanity. Remember at the end of your day and at the end of each meal that countless men, women and children across the African continent lack the bare minimum of necessities for survival; abject poverty, malnourishment, drought, famine and starvation are the reality for so many people. Whilst this may seem inconceivably unfathomable to some of us living in Western opulence ... it is sadly all too true. Instead of buying materialistic Christmas gifts this year ... think about making a charitable donation to the CHF -- Canadian Hunger Foundation -- they have been ceaselessly engaged in the fight against poverty, inequality and hunger across the globe for the last fifty years. Don't buy some empty bauble, toy or iThing this season ... instead give the gift of a dairy cow, goat or vegetable garden to a family in dire need. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ethiopian reviewer: the food is amazing. Authentic and good pricing. However, the wait times are unreasonable. Waiting over 2 hours for a plate coupled with poor service is unacceptable. The owner refused giving an extra napkin to my friend because one was originally provided. Poor customer service. They can do a lot better. If you don't mind the poor service, would highly recommend. The food is unbeatable. But the service was a deal breaker."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Had the vegetarian combo plate and loved it, everything was perfectly spiced. (Came out to $27 with tax for 2 people.) This place is also BYOB which is great because it does take a long time to receive your order, so it's nice to have something to drink while you wait. Don't forgo the reservation - when we went there wasn't a single table that hadn't been reserved and we watched a couple of groups get turned away for that reason."}
{"text":"This is a BYOB and here they take it literally you bring what every you'd like to drink not just alcohol. 
This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food and eating with my hands.  They have literally no utensils.
But the experience was amazing. 
Food was really good, seasoning was unique and they even make their own injera bread. A spongy pancake-like bread that you tear and pick up your food with.  In other words everything is literally made from scratch.  
This is a family run business, very well run by Husband and Wife and they did serve the best Ethiopian food in Montreal."}
{"text":"After all these years I finally lost my Ethiopian food virginity to East Africa Restaurant. Mom and Pop run hole in the wall establishment. Pop takes orders - Mom cooks - You eat. Simple as that. Every review here says bring a bottle of wine. I'd say bring two. Service is SUPER SLOW. Took almost an hour to get our food. But again its not a fast food place. Everything is made fresh. About the food, Its served on one big plate and you share.  Another thing, You need fingers to eat this food. No cutlery here. The meat and the veggies are spread on a soft Ethiopian bread (Ingera).  Everything we had was delicious. Can't wait to try out other things.


Food : Great
Service :You gotta be kiddin me
Ambiance : All in all it's just another hole in the wall
Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Loved it! Get the no. 4 ( some lamb curry) the best imo. It is a small homey family owned restaurant. The couple does everything. Food is delicious but can be a little spicy. Get ready to eat with your fingers. For some reason, it felt really humid inside. It was not a cold day either (about 15C). Will definitely go again when im in the area."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian combo plate, a delicious, filling bargain at $12. Served on a big Injera pancake, a wonderful way to eat. BYOB.

I've been to a dozen Ethiopian restaurants and this one seems typical: good quality food in copious quantities at excellent value. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"No question, my favorite restaurant in the city. This tiny little mom-and-pop affair. Everything is made fresh to order, no microwaving or reheating. Not that cheap, but you'll usually have to skip lunch to make room. Don't come here for the quick service; you'll be here for a while. You can call ahead with your order, though. BYOB."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half before we even got our food and we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant :( We ended up having to take it to go, everything was mush and mine was overpoweringly dosed in ginger to the point that you couldn't taste anything else. It was a sad experience :( I'd be willing to try again but apparently you wait a long time for your food and you aren't offered anything to graze on while waiting."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Ethiopian food. 
Choice your meat and chops you spice level. Lamb, chicken, ground beef or steak. 
The menu also includes a variety of vegetarian versions with lentils and chickpeas. 

The ensemble is served on the traditional flat bread that reminded me of a thick spongy crepe. 

No forks can be found on the table, just a napkin. Get ready to use your fingers and use the bread as your food delivery vessel. 
My buddy and I got the mild and medium spicy lamb plates. It was delicious. 

I highly recommend. The owner is very friendly and accessing. 

Reservations are recommended. 

Great spot for a date!"}
{"text":"We literally waited 2 hours+ for our food. 
It seems like the owners were just going waaay out of the way to try and save as much money as possible, so they serve everything on one plate, start actually cooking anything when you order, and have no utensils. 

They didn't even have take out boxes for us when we didn't finish the food.. lol 

There's a difference between not wanting to waste food, so you don't over prep.. vs being stingy. Not a good way to run a food business."}
{"text":"Yes you have to go all the way to NDG and find this place that does not look fancy and yes you might need to wait for an hour and half for your order to be served, but is the food worth it? Absolument! The sour dough flat bread injera mixes so well with the well spiced meat and veggie dishes that we finished everything in 11 minutes, and kept thinking about the flavour for days after."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic ethiopian food look no further. It reminds me of eating over at my ethiopian friend's place when her mom would cook. 

Everything tastes fresh and homemade, you won't believe you're actually eating at a restaurant and not someone's home. It's BYOB which is always a plus and even a necessity in this case as the service is VERY slow. 

Keep in mind there are only two people managing the restaurant though, the wife who cooks and the husband who seems to be doing the service. So get a bottle of wine (or 2) and just take it easy - the food is worth the long wait trust me !"}
{"text":"TLDR: Bold Authentic and addictive food that is worth the wait. Remember that sharing is caring. Also, if you want coffee at the end order it when you order your food.

Just like all the other reviews, I must start off this review with a warning not to come hungry. This restaurant is more like walking into this mum and pop's home than a restaurant, and the cooking only starts once you order. With that said, the food is well worth the wait. Also, all the food comes on one giant serving platter, whether it be meat dishes or vegetarian. Sharing is caring, and you do not get individual dishes here.

The food was so good that I came twice in the span of a week. The first time was with friend's the second was with family because I knew they needed to try the amazing goodness.

The first time we ordered four vegetarian combos. The combo comes with spinach, two kinds of lentils and split peas (I forgot which ones exactly). We also ordered the tomato salad for some bright fresh flavour.

The food came an hour later on a large circular serving platter. The combos sat atop a delicately sour fluffy and spongy injera bread which soaked up all the excess juices. The tomato salad sat in the middle and rolled injera bread for each person laid on the outskirts of the circular platter.

At this restaurant, you eat with your hands and you pick up bites of food with the injera bread. Every bite was a burst of flavour and brought pure joy to my belly. The tomato salad was nice relief from some of the spicier dishes, and balanced well with the bold flavours coming from the cooked dishes. I highly recommend that if you visit this restaurant that order at least one veggie combo.

That's exactly what I did the next time I went with my family. We ordered the veggie combo, the tomato salad, fried lamb (14) and lean ground beef (10). We decided to call and order in advance hoping that our food would be ready when we arrived for our reservation at 7. Our food once again only arrived an hour later (~8:15), and it was fantastic. I still have trouble describing the deliciousness that we experienced. The flavours jumped and every bite was a new taste.

At the end, we wanted to try the coffee but we were informed that it was too late to order. The next time I go, which I predict is sometime soon, I will definitely order coffee or tea at the beginning.

This place is great for groups of people or an intimate date. Just remember do not come hungry or you will turn hangry. The mum and pop who manage the restaurant, she cooks and he waits, are adorably sweet. Bon't expect quick service. Everything is a nice and slow experience at East African Restaurant.

Highly recommend, and it's BYOB! So if you like to drink, bring a nice red wine or red beer to compliment the dishes you will most definitely be enjoying.

LAST NOTE! Apparently, they do takeout!!! But it's a great experience eating at the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Went again last night and spent a couple hours here. So many awesome dishes. Just explain what kind of dish you want and the guy should know exactly what to make. Everything made fresh to order.

Again, this is a family restaurant, just the mom and dad working, so it's not really \"service\" but just a way to hang out and drink BYOW and eat amazing food."}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh and tasty dishes. Tiny and intimate, the restaurant and servers are perfectly lovely."}
{"text":"You think that only Indians know their spices? You're wrong. Since it was my first time trying Ethiopian food, each element on the plate felt like an unique, exciting, and delicious adventure of different spices. We ordered a lamb dish and a mixed vegetarian platter which was served to us on the same plate along with some injera bread. So soft they were! I could see myself relaxing in a spa with a sheet of injera over my face. But of course, the real purpose of the injera is to use it as a scooping vehicle for the food. 

The service was on the sloppier side. Somewhat slow and inattentive but very friendly. There were only two people working in this red lit restaurant equipped with a minimalistic kitchen. 

If you're going to eat with your friends then I recommend each picking a different dish because it'll most likely be on a big sharing plate. Also don't forget to wash your hands unless you also want to share some of the colonies of bacteria living on your hands. Why do that? Because there aren't any utensils so don't bother asking. For me, any food eaten by hand is almost guaranteed to be fun.

Enjoy your messy fingers and have a good meal!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! It's owned by a lovely Ethiopian couple who cook and serve you as well. The food is extra delicious, and the atmosphere very cosy. I've been many times and tried practically everything on the menu, it's all excellent. Be prepared to eat with your table mates from a shared large central dish & scoop the food using the injera bread. This adds to the authenticity, uniqueness & fun of the experience. 
Also recommended: try the Ethiopian coffee - it's a whole process/ ceremony, and it's probably the smoothest coffee you've ever had. It takes a long time to prepare so it's best you ask for it early. 
Also a good idea to call & reserve and give an idea of what you might want to order to ensure that you will get everything you want."}
