{"text":"Spent $50 on $20 worth of food. Battered chicken wings?!, dumplings were super mini and disgusting, chicken balls were all different sized (same batter as chicken wings), Egg rolls tasted frozen and then microwaved, wonton soup was terrible. I would have been better off going to the grocery store and buying a frozen chinese dinner. Ordered through justeat.ca where they had great reviews, but clearly the reviews were false."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from Panda Chef and loved it! The food was awesome. General Tso was perfectly made. Snow peas and corn were really flavourful. Rice noodles were also delicious. The food came super fast too! Definitely ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I got my food delivered through The Just Eat app. 

I got the Special Fried Rice, which was decent.  Also got shrimp spring rolls which were also not bad. We also got the Kung Pao Chicken.  It might have been one of the worst things I have ever eaten in my life. Kung Pao chicken is supposed to pack a punch flavor wise but theirs is dead. The chicken quality was terrible and there wasn't much of it. It was mostly just stir fried veggies. Stir fried veggies are not supposed to be in Kung Pao Chicken.  WTF?!?!"}
{"text":"worst chinese food ever. uber eats should remove it from its options. the general tao was cold, not spicy and chewy. the tom kha soup smelled like i soaked my feet in it and tasted even worse. i pray i don't get sick from the little i swallowed.

no utensils..not a fork, not a spoon for soup...not even chopsticks..no napkins..nothing

I should have checked the reviews first...I would not have ordered if i had."}
{"text":"Worst spicy wings I ever had in my life. I should have read the reviews on Yelp first. I ordered Spicy wings and beef chop-suey. The beef chop- suey was ok but the wings were terrible. They were heavily battered and very greasy and most importantly lacked spice. The 'spice' was actually at the bottom of the serving container. We ordered from Just Eat. The driver and delivery time was fine, and the food arrived hot but was not great compared to other similar take-out places like Canton Chile, that have mastered 'Spicy Wings. Save your money and avoid this place..."}
{"text":"Sweet sour pork was really good
Chow mein was almost a glass noodle not super traditional 
Had s nice flavour-- not goopy with msg which was nice just not what I was expecting 
Needed green veggies in it
Wonton soup was ok"}
