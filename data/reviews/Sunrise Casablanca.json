{"text":"My husband and I come here all the time and we love it!!!! The bar staff is great and the food is sooooo good I would give it 5 stars but sometimes gets to smoky when it gets busy and we really don't like that but other than that it's a great place where everyone knows you and feels great to feel welcomed!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar.  The bartenders are very attentive.  In addition, the atmosphere is inviting, kinda a local feel.  The food is excellent.  This is truly a bar you can come to relax with friends or by yourself.  The clientele will make you feel like you are a regular and leave you wanting to return."}
{"text":"Greatest place on the mountain! 
Wonderful barstaff, great view, play pool, gaming, or have a party!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years It's definitely one of the best kept secrets in Sunrise Manor. Great atmosphere, great food, affordable drinks. It's not overcrowded and the employees and clientele are very cool. I'll continue to head to the \"Cas\" whenever I get a chance!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! They offered us their player's advantage system which is great! You get points every time you gamble! Plus $20 on your birthday! : ) loved the view of the strip!"}
{"text":"When out with my husband for a nice dinner experience, we chose CasaBlanca because we had a wonderful experience in the past, being served by Tom. Today, Saturday it was a terrible experience . Unless you're setting at the bar drinking and gambling,  don't expect to get service.  The old lady server said the she was not able to give us good service because she was working \"along\" although her and the cook we at the bar area socializing. The older lady server said to us \"wave for service\" what's that about? During shift change (5pm) the tall blond lady server grabs a beer, lights a cigarette and also sits at the bar to socialize. Now there are 2 servers ignoring our table. When the cook (nice guy) brought our food to the table, we were able to ask for our drink refills. The refills were not coming like they should. 
BTW: The food was great!
We continued to be neglected. No one check on us after the food was delivered. We finished eating our food. The 2 servers continue to socialize with each other watching the tv screen as if they had nothing to do, as the (blond) continued to drinking and smoking. 
The old lady server has checked out, off the clock and is now sitting at the bar with a bottle of beer, a cigarette in her mouth, purse and money in hand getting ready to gamble. But she never made sure we were taken care of, nor did she tell the blond server about us. When I got up out of the booth to ask for the check, the old lady said \"I'm off the clock, I did know\".  I don't recommend this place for dining during the weekend. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Four stars based on eastside options. We are surrounded by pt's so it is what it is if you want to stay near home. I've seen this place since I was a kid and never thought to check it out. It's decent and an okay change of scenery from the typical pt stop."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! 

Welcoming 
Straight forward bartender and kind to us
Food was hot and tasty
The vibe was good 
Vape and smoking friendly 

I'm glad I finally stopped by and got to try it here. I enjoyed dinner and a couple of drinks. Overall this place is a chill and relaxing spot. Good thing it's only down the street! This is the place to go if you don't wanna travel far or spend a lot of money. Bartender was straightforward and friendly. Food was fresh and tasty. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they always make you feel at home. Most of the bartenders, especially Jim, are awesome! Superb service with a smile & never a dry drink. Jim is seriously my favorite though, super attentive & a master of his craft. Josh & Toni are great too, awesome service & always make you feel comfortable. The food has changed a bit but still yummy."}
{"text":"The bartender is racist. He didn't want to give us free drinks while playing. Didn't want to look directly at us. For a place called \"casa Blanca\" should be more friendly to Hispanics"}
{"text":"This place is the best! The food is great,  I love the specials. The ribeye is always good if you want a steak. Clean and very nice staff"}
{"text":"You have to come swing shift Tuesday-Thursday and see Jim.  He's always on point, personable, and you never have to wait for four a drink!  And Yasmin is a great chef!"}
{"text":"Great food, terrific bartender what more could you ask for a neighborhood bar? Several friends recommended Casablanca and we finally got there last night (Sunday). I am not sure why we waited so long and its close to home! Hubby had the steak, done to order, so tender and tasty! I had fish and chips and it is awesome. Not too much batter, fish was done perfectly. The bartender is an amazing lady, she is attentive and outgoing and really made us feel welcome! We highly recommend the Casablanca, it is now our go to place!"}
{"text":"Employees are fantastic! Great location & very convenient on the way home or a quick drink with friends."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar! I love this place the staff is so friendly and down to earth. Food is sooo good and very affordable too! Very clean, definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, cheap prices,
Specials on alcohol, everything is really clean. What more could you ask for? Is this place a 5 star place overall in the grand scheme of things? No. Does this place achieve 5 star ratings in all areas, and is it the best little neighborhood bar/gaming/food spot it can be? Yes.

If you live on the east side/sunrise area, check it out for drinks, billiards, sports, snacks. You will like it. And so will your wallet."}
{"text":"The food is decent, prices fair and the service is good. It's very smoky but the atmosphere is friendly."}
{"text":"Meh. Typical neighborhood bar. Went on an early Fri. evening so the place was starting to get busy but not too packed so good balance there. Typical bar food but big portions & tasty so points there. HEAVY pour on the drinks.... like throatburning harsh. Music way too loud...have to shout over the sound system. Good for what it is - a neighborhood bar. Don't expect more than that and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have frequent this bar for a while now. Small nice bar that makes you feel comfortable with the bartenders and cooks. Have came in all different shifts and days. Jim, Shannon, Josh, Zach, Toni and Ron. (I believe that's his name, graveyard bartender) all so kind and make you feel welcomed. They have two pool tables, a video game, darts and a jukebox. They have specials for everyday that change by the day. There food is delicious so far have had the nachos and wings but they are yum! 
They have a Happy Hour from 3p.m- 6p.m"}
{"text":"Great service...just didnt care for the smoky environment. The friend mushrooms are excellent!"}
{"text":"Sunrise Casablanca is a nice little bar tucked away on the East Side of Las Vegas (I think it's actually apart of Sunrise Manor, NV but whatevs).  I like to cruise by here to relax, sit at the bar, and watch a game on the TVs hanging above the bar itself.  Not too crowded when I go in and still not crowded by the time I leave.. just how I like it.  They have a full menu of bar food and also have Black Butte Porter, which is one of my favs, on tap.  Nice bar, nice people.. definitely stop in to try it when you're in my neck o' the woods.  Definitely a good time."}
{"text":"Great outside seating very reasonable prices and really good food!  Highly recommend!  Also, Shannon is the best, super friendly and really personable."}
{"text":"So I have been living in Sunrise Manor for nearly two decades now and this place has been there ever since I've lived here yet I never ventured in. I would always be shocked to see the neon purple lights STILL flashing nearly 20 years later. I seriously thought this place stuck around this long because the owner probably lived inside as I would always only see 1-2 cars in the parking lot.

This time a donned my BGPs (Brave Girl Panties) and finally entered this humble, quaint restaurant/bar. And oh was I ever so happy to. WHY HAVEN'T I VENTURED IN HERE SOONER??!?!  Much to my astonishment, this place is not so bad!! It's spacious, open, ample lighting, tvs, a shuffleboard, video poker, center bar with stools, tables surrounding. And the reason why I probably only saw two cars all the time is because there's ample parking at the north entrance. 

I only had draft Newcastle and it was perfect pricing $3.75. My pseudo-hubster had a Bud and that was only $3.25. Next time I'll have to sample some food and those 4 stars may turn into 5!"}
{"text":"Items Ordered:
-Chicken tenders
-Blue Moon Bottle

This is based off of a one time visit. 

I didn't really get a good vibe from the bartender upon arriving with my friends. I'm not sure if it was, because we were in our early 20s and some of the girls looked young or what. 

I thought I would check this place out since it's 2 minutes walking distance. 

The food was good and the prices were decent, but at a neighborhood bar you'd think you would feel more at home or welcome. 

Maybe if my friends convince me to go, and I'll give it another review."}
{"text":"If you are an East Sider, The Blanca is the bar you want to go to. The bartenders are cool , the food is Good, and the slots are loose! Its a chill atmosphere with a lot of returning customers. All the bartenders know your name ... like the show \"Cheers\". Lol What more can you ask for? 
 
FOOD&DRINKS
I usually order chicken wings and fries which is always on point. The shrimp cocktail is basic but still good. The shrimp basket is also yummy, fried to perfection with a perfect crisp in every bite. They have daily food specials that are so worth it! 

The bartenders learned my drink after the first visit and that honestly made me want to keep coming back. They have a good liquor selection, although the drinks are nothing fancy , they do get the job done! 

Only thing is I wished they served lunch. If you are looking to grab food, they only serve food during dinner hours."}
{"text":"This bar is pretty cool for being located on the East Side.  I came here for my first time with some family and we asked what kind of drinks they could make.  Our bartender, Ron, said that he was down to make anything we ordered as long as he had the ingredients.  He was able to make us a BJ, Alien Brain Hemorrhage, B-52 (like the band lol), and concoctions of his own. 

They also have a jukebox and I love their music selection!  We played everything from Queen to Nsync and ended our night with Semisonic's \"Closing Time.\" 

The staff and customers are awesome and this place definitely gave me the Cheers vibe - where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came.  Check it out if you're ever in the area.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"they used to have a steak and fries special. but its been months since I've gone, and I never wrote a review, I was online browsing yelp tonight came across this page, just wanted to give my two cents. its very smokey. Bartenders was prompt, but the food WAS NOT cooked to order,,,haven't been back yet, not really sure if I want to. Anyways, that's all!!!!"}
