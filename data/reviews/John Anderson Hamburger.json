{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty fresh food. Wanted to grab  dinner after work so called ahead to have it ready for me. They normally close at 5:30pm Fridays and I was rushing to get there from work but unfortunately got stuck in traffic. The woman I had placed my order with, called me back 15 mins after they had closed to tell me not to worry (I had apologized to her for being late), and that they will wait for me until i get there. To my surprise once I arrived, 30 mins late, the lovely woman and older gentlemen were sitting patiently waiting. They were incredibly nice and spoke to me a bit (random small talk). I absolutely love their friendly attitude and warm and welcoming nature. Food (chicken souvlaki dinner)  was prepared fresh and tasted fantastic (and portion size was big). Will most certainly go back."}
{"text":"This place has the best home made banquet burger around. Not only that but everything I've had there has been great. 

The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I go there at least a couple times a week for lunch. There is no better lunch spot in the area!!

I would recommend this place to any and everybody."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in markham
Got the homeburger with poutine and a drink it was only around 10 bucks, very well worth the money. Definitely going to drop by more often for lunch."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try and I'm sorry I did. I ordered their homeburger with onion rings. The burger was burnt on the outside, but the inner meat wasn't bad. However, the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles didn't taste fresh. The onion rings where fried too long that they were quite oily. It wasn't worth the $13 and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger.

Had regular cheeseburger and tasted good.

Would not go out of my way to return but good enough to give a white if in the area.

Serves breakfast as well."}
{"text":"The best hamburger in Markham.  The patty has an intrinsic spice and flavour that adds to the layers of flavour."}
{"text":"Greasy breakfast joint located in an industrial plaza in Markham. 

Friendly staff who are eager to please. Mods to the menu may slow things down but it's ok. Best intentions. 

Ordered the 3 eggs, no meat, plus tomatoes and whole wheat toast no butter. Home fires were included. 

Eggs were over cooked. Tomatoes were not seasoned. Whole wheat toast was your standard wonder bread bagged bread. Home fries were good. 

If the breakfast was $5-6 and included a coffee I'd understand the appeal. But it's about $6-8, coffee extra, which in my opinion isn't good value given the food alone. (As a side note, everything else is kinda greasy as well - use the salt/pepper shaker). 

It's never been busy at this place during breakfast. There are a couple other breakfast joints (Milliken and Tom's) that serve very similar fare but I have to say that Tom's is the best bang for buck taking into account quality, flavour, accuracy of order and of course the actual food itself :) i think that given the other options in the area, this place needs to make some serious moves to compete."}
{"text":"I live right nearby and drive by all the time but never really went. Saw this place has some great reviews so decided to try it out. 

Got the home burger, it was like a triple patty in one, and was delicious. Fries were decent, but a combo ran me $11.25 which was a bit steep. Might skip the fries next time. 

Like others have said staff is friendly and the joint is nice overall. Bathrooms were a bit dirty though unfortunately. 

My only complaint about the food was the toppings. The lettuce seemed old and was not crispy at all very soggy. also the cucumbers were not very crispy. 

Overall though it was a nice meal!"}
{"text":"I don't know if John Anderson Hamburger is still owned by the family of John Anderson, but this particular location is a good old fashioned hamburger joint.  Tucked in a business plaza at the north east corner of 14th Avenue and Warden Avenue, John Anderson is as unnoticeable as can be.   I ordered a home burger ($6; cheese $0.50 extra) and a coffee ($1.50).  The burger was made to order.  The patty was so big that it covered the complete face of the bun.  It was not dry at all, and it was tasty.  I asked for all toppings, and the staff was not stingy in piling them up.  The coffee was good; it woke me up.

In addition to hamburger, JA also sells salad, sandwich, poutine, Greek food such as gyros and souvlaki, chicken finger, etc..  For breakfast, JA has egg/bacon/toast type of breakfast as well as pastries.  This small store is a Jack of all trades.  Just a note that the owner is a Greek gentleman, so I suspect that the Greek entrees are okay.

The staffs were very friendly and quick behind the counter.

The decor looks like the store used to be a donut shop.  It has many tables.  It does not have the vibe of a hamburger joint, but the store is clean, so it is competent as a lunch stop.

Customers kept walking in during my short 30-minute stay.  They all ordered the home burger and poutine.  I figure that a good hamburger joint is always a neighbourhood favourite.

They accept Visa and Mastercard.

Overall, a solid 3.5 stars hamburger joint."}
{"text":"Classic Diner in the Markham area.

Two older guys in the kitchen cranking out amazing eggs breakfast and burgers all day loving it.

Barbecue sauce is amazing in homemade. Eggs breakfast classic three eggs bacon sausage home fries and toast.

Very reasonably priced excellent food and enjoy the simple and not complicated. Looking forward to coming back soon when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered a 7.5 ounce home burger.. 

Burger itself was home made and lacked flavour.. I would say just a bit undercooked which made in this case made it even taste worse.. tomatoes slices were too thick adding to the problem of it under cooked.. cooked onions were cold, which also added to the problem of it under cooked. Too many details were done incorrectly making the burger a fail for me..

For $8.50 a burger and $1.60 for a can of pop, I would much rather go elsewhere..

For the amount of talent that has recently overwhelmed the food industry over the past years, this brand hasn't kept up with the times.. sad.."}
{"text":"We tried their standard breakfast platter and a chicken dinner souvlaki meal.  They make real, homestyle rice (herbed, lemon, oil), and the souvlaki is nicely grilled. Dinner comes with a generous salad portion too."}
{"text":"Yes I was told this place have good hamburger, but I'm not in the mood for one. So just order an all day breakfast combo.... What can you say about bacon, egg, and toast?
Being a mom and pops type of family restaurant, mom and pop (they are now grandma and Grandpa) were there serving and cooking.  I mean for real!  People from the neighborhood, and folks from before the relocation shows up.  Makes it a very homey type of feel.  The d√©cor is definately not a place to hang out with you girl friend (unless u want to relive the good old 50-60's today), but for a quick meal, sure!
3 star for nothing special, but may change my mind after I try their hamburger next time."}
{"text":"I contemplated adding this review, seeing as it was already done by Steven S.

But you know what, I am going to add to his review.

I'm not going to summarize what happened, but I would like to add that I have driven by here a few times, and I hadn't had the chance to eat here yet. Yes, I will be honest, I have no idea how the burgers taste, but I'm sure it's just mediocre from what I've heard from friends.

So is it fair to rate this place based on such an incident? Yes, I firmly believe that. This is because you, especially as an owner, represent your store. When you act immature, irrational, and extremely rude, you're letting us know what kind of person runs this restaurant.

So what kind of person runs this restaurant? The kind that picks on people who are smaller than them. Can't speak English? Perfect, you can take advantage of that, and continue yelling unnecessarily at an older couple who has no idea what you're saying, and are scared.

Metaphorically, I would like to say to you, pick on someone your own size.

And, if in actual fact you were that bothered by the fact that someone was parked in a spot (that did NOT have a sign stating it was for your restaurant), you need to call parking enforcement. Even if they were parked in a spot that had your sign, you do not resort to barbaric yelling. You ask nicely. Then you proceed to call the appropriate authorities if they refuse. However, since an officer had told them to park there earlier, I'm sure they would overpower any parking enforcer. 

The point is, this situation shows what kind of person this owner is. I'm sure the staff is nicer than the actual owner, but I will not support any business with owners who act like that. And I'm glad I never got the chance to. 

I hope you felt like a big shot today."}
