{"text":"We went to Cafe Sam to celebrate 2 birthdays. Service was slow. Downstairs was not to busy. Four out of seven meals were unedible. Steaks we found out were from last week for Valentines Day. The steaks were tough needless to say. No bread. I had to ask for our salads. Manger Dan really was passive in talking to us. He did give us alcoholic drinks which was nice but I don't drink alcohol. The only thing that was great was conversation with friends."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Pittsbugh restaurants. The menu is huge and they have a lot of daily specials. The food never disappoints me and the service is excellent"}
{"text":"Cafe Sam is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  As others have said, it is somewhat quirky (the mannequin they have seated at the bar is a bit unnerving the first time you notice it), but the food is consistently good, the portions are nicely sized, and the prices are excellent especially if you order the right stuff.  The interior is decorated with lots of antiques and stained glass and the upstairs patio is really a fantastic retreat from the Oakland/Bloomfield area if you go on a night when the weather is good.  They always have a ton of daily specials as well as drink specials (the $4 cosmo is certainly worth every penny of my grad student salary!).  Every time I visit, there's always been a point in the meal when one of the servers brings around a sampler tray with an appetizer or a drink; they've offered samples of things varying from strawberry or peach daquiris, a pizza appetizer, cold berry soup, etc.    I HIGHLY recommend the baked almond-crusted brie appetizer; the cheese is delicious with the almonds and raspberry sauce and they arrange tons of fresh fruit on the plate for you to munch at as well.  We never fail to order this when we stop by."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I'm not a fan of this place. The prices were very high for the quality of food. Not that the food was bad, but it wasn't great, and for the price it certainly wasn't good enough. The wait staff was nice, and was attentive, but would forget things and made our bill ( true it was a party of 10) a freaking nightmare. 2 waitresses recording their own bill, so two bills with everyone's items on both bills just randomly. Confusing, and a pain. The place it self is nice, but when the food isn't very good and way over priced, and the bar is SUPER over priced what's the point?"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best and a local gem.  The menu has something for everyone and the staff and the hostess are all awesome."}
{"text":"My fave lunch place. Mary, the hostess, and waitstaff are all very friendly. Wonderful, healthful food in a relaxing atmosphere.Try an Ahi Tuna salad!"}
{"text":"Went twice in 2 days. Outstanding service. Great menu choices. Had a fabulous veal chop. Will go back the next time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had been living in Pittsburgh for 2 years and had driven by Cafe Sam a million times. Finally, we decided to give it a try. We went in for lunch. The place itself is quaint and charming. The staff were also very polite and provided great service. However, their food was awful. I ordered a flatbread, and it was soft and soggy. It tasted like a microwave pizza from Walmart. Definitely not a flatbread. My fiance ordered a turkey wrap that was 90% lettuce and had barely any turkey in it. It also came with a side of cabbage and something weird smelling that we couldn't even figure out. After all this, we went home and were struck ill. Let's just say I couldn't eat anything else the rest of the day. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Listen...it's quirky but the right food is great. The seafood cocktail is awesome, and its the only restaurant in pittsburgh to be affordable about lamb tongue, escagot, and other things u may have always wanted to try. Vegan additions lately. Think all encompassing (largest menu ever) diner except better and fancier quirky environment.  Patio outside upstairs too. Sometimes i get the duck. Yum."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice setting and pleasant decor, but the food is seriously lacking.  I always know it's going to be trouble when the menu is excessively long... that says to me that the restaurant does many things, but really nothing well.  And that's exactly what I got at Cafe Sam.  I had a pulled pork sandwhich that was bland, dry, and not particularly well put together.  My girlfriend had a similarly bland meal.  It was fine for lunch while we killed time waiting on the dealership to finish working on her car, but I won't be back by choice.  Toast!  down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch."}
{"text":"The first sign that something was up was the menu having items not even remotely Italian. Though so be it, why not mix things up? Then, it took a long time to get the food after being seated, about 1 hour. Even if we waited a little while to order, that was still a long time. The food. It was food. Good food? Not so much, but food it was. Either bland, a bit too cooked or just not at all how you'd expect somethings to be prepared. I've had plenty of good Italian food, great food even, and while I wasn't expecting that, this still fell well below my expectations.  The good news, our waitress Brianna (SP?) was great. She was attentive and while busy at times, was always on point. I appreciated the effort to correct or improve things that we didn't like and the complimentary drinks, though given the long wait for food and the poor food quality, I wouldn't go back. Three stars for the staff and effort."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food at an affordable price. Very attentive staff made us feel very welcome and at home. Food was very nice - I had a huge steak with lots of flavor, cooked to perfection. They have delicious strawberry soup - desert like creamy - tastes like heaven.  The quality of the food and service are on par with restaurants that charge twice as much. Definitely come back again with some friends. Very good location for romantic dinner to bring your special one on a date."}
{"text":"It was awesome. Pampered by the hostess, Mary. Lots of complementary extras. Great for romantic dinner too (although I went alone)"}
{"text":"Simply one of the most bizarre dining experiences I've ever had. Food wasn't terrible, but not very good either.   Complimentary strawberry soup??  Pasta and red sauce served with sliced kiwi on top?? Bizarre.   Sat on the upstairs outdoor rooftop, which was charmingly decorated with dead plants and flowers in plastic Miller lite cups and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.   If anything, it was memorable."}
{"text":"Not great. Stale bread and the food was strongly over-flavored. I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another, and I said \"just a half glass\" which I ask for all the time (and get). The reply from the waitress was \"we can't do that\" and the same from the manager. CAN'T do that? Terrible attitude - more like WON'T do that. Well, I WON'T be going back"}
{"text":"Traveling on business me and my family wanted something nice but not too expensive. We decided to try cafe sams out as it was close to our hotel. I cannot give enough stars to this restaurant as they have exceeded our expectations in every way. The service was amazing the prices were very honest, the owners made my wife feel very comfortable that having our 2 yr old with us as he can sometimes be a little noisy. The food was to die for as we couldn't stop eating once until our meals were done! When we come to Pittsburgh again we will definitely be making it a priority to stop at sams cafe again. Again we will be recommending this place to everyone and anyone!!!!!! 10 out of 5 stars will recommend to anyone for a great night"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for dates, in-town visitors, nice occasions. Been a customer for years and have no plans to change that. While it has several notable flaws, the all-around strengths of this establishment make it a top any-occasion choice in Pittsburgh.   Situated in what looks like a small white house than you'd never see unless looking for, this is a quirky, unique interior. There is a piano at the bar, and a mannequin sitting there you'd swear was real until you looked with a startled grin.   One of two managers always greet you and check in at least once at your table. They are friendly, solicitous, and helpful.   The service can be under-experienced at times, but always, ALWAYS pleasant and helpful. They bring out a card at the beginning of each meal and read of a seemingly endless list of specials not on the menu. These are amazing - they vary from the simple (pierogies fried in butter and onions) to the weird (duck mousse and pita). As if these aren't options aren't enough, your large menu, including seafood, steak, meats, and pastas, has each option prepared in your choice of three different ways. This makes it perfect for the picky and the adventurous both.   A winning touch is the staff that circulates with free drink samples and hors-douvres. I've been to many a restaurant and yet to find any at this level that offer this touch of service that makes you glad you're there.   The price for all this is quite fair! After taking my mother there and having a drink, appetizers, salads, dinner, and dessert, the check was under $70 with tip. I don't think these prices can be beat.   The cons are only two: (1) Not every dish is executed well. They strive to be new, adventurous and different, and don't always succeed; (2) I'm a huge fan of desserts and, though there's always quite the variance, I've yet to have one that I enjoyed. The coconut ice cream was in particular a failure: vanilla ice cream with tasteless, dry coconut flakes on it is pretty inexcusable.   All in all, I couldn't really recommend a place more highly for any occasion more fancy than McDonald's and less fancy than Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"As much as I love the food here, I'm sad to say this is likely our last time coming here. I realize that coming as a party of 5 on Saturday night without a reservation is usually tough to accommodate, yet I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess told me they would move a table around and it would be about 10 minutes.   We waited for 15-20 minutes and watched about 4 parties get sat before we asked what was taking so long since she had told us they were just moving a table. The hostess was very defensive and said that we shouldn't expect to get sat so soon without a reservation on a Saturday night, so we asked why she told us it would be 10 minutes. She then said that she needed to seat people with reservations before she could seat us and completely refused to acknowledge that she had given us a misleading wait time. I understand that it's hard to guage wait times, but when you're wrong you should simply apologize and not blame the guests for how they planned their evening.   When we finally got sat, our server Angel was very good and the Buffalo style salmon steak is delicious.   I really like the food here, but the fact of the matter is their customer service tonight was inexcusable. Even when the customer is wrong, you don't blame them and say \"I'm sorry, but...\" You simply apologize and try to defuse the situation instead of getting defensive and escalating the situation. If the hostess had simply said \"I apologize for the wait taking longer than expected, we should be able to seat you in 5 minutes\" and thanked us for our patience there would never have been an issue.   I love the food, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I dined at Cafe Sam twice during a business trip and was pleasantly surprised both times. The Veal Chop and Porterhouse are recommended highly. The cook was perfect, delicious, and met the mark. The Creme Brule was amazing -- Key Lime and Snickerdoodle. Colleagues ordered the chocolate cake and pecan pie and were impressed and delighted.   Although the food and prices here make this restaurant stand out, what really made my experience perfect was the great service. Mary, Rachel, Angel: very well done! You made us feel welcome and comfortable and didn't hesitate to make our dining experiences top-notch. If I could give 10 stars, I would. You rocked my socks off and whenever I am in PGH again, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was staying in the hotel around the corner, when the hubs and I decided we were hungry and walked over.  Apparently they are not open during certain hours, so we walked in on a staff meeting.  Since there wasn't much else to walk to for sit-down dinner, we came back later and were not disappointed.  Staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  The menu was extensive (which can sometimes be an issue if you're like me and can't ever decide).  I had a filet in Bearnaise sauce - delicious.  Prices were reasonable.  The only thing that could may be improved would be the decor.  I mean, I'm not picky, and I'd still continue to eat there based on service/price/food, however, it kind of looks like an old folks home in there.  And there's a mannequin at the bar?  Just sayin'...."}
{"text":"If you're looking to spend a few hours out with company, then this would be a great place to do so. I will only give a time line without opinions.  Seated at 620. Waiter arrived to take order 15 mins later.  Ordered the four course fixed menu. Got the soup in 15mins. Took another 20 for them to bring the salad, which was brought at the same time as my entree.  Caesar salad was a wedge of iceberg with a bit of dressing.  75mins in and still haven't received the included piece of chocolate cake  He brought me a complementary drink to apologize at the 80 minute mark.  85 minutes in brought a 2in x 3in piece of chocolate cake with ice cream.  I was alone after the first thirty minutes, as my husband had to leave for a meeting, and there were plenty of empty tables.  The waiter was very polite and a woman I'm guessing was an owner checked in on me towards the end."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for the first time.  Definitely a fan of the vibe - we sat up on the roof patio and it was like a garden oasis in the middle of the Baum/Center eyesore.  The decor managed to almost completely block out the view of Ritters and the UPMC parking lot next door - a major plus.  The inside was, as others have already commented, very pastel and outdated, reminding me of my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  Definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion, but then again there were quite a few old ladies there, so maybe they just know their crowd.    I'll cut to the chase: the food was GREAT.  For not super expensive, there were large quantities, many options, a very helpful waitress who helped us make some very difficult choices, and a clear willingness to tailor anything on the menu to suit our needs.    One last thing about the service, which is what earns Cafe Sam its 5th star -- we were running late to see a play after dinner, which was our own poor planning.  But as soon as we alerted the waitress to the situation, she bent over backwards to get us our food as quickly as possible, take-out containers so we could finish on the road, and the check paid without delay.  It was definitely above and beyond the call of duty, and we wouldn't have made it on time without her help.  Great food, great service, weird but nice decor.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a lovely experience here. Great martinis and the desserts were TO DIE FOR. Irish creme cake and the ice cream crepe were superb.  Martinis pretty good--the house has a selection of infused vodkas to add to their pretty tasty drinks.  We dined on the patio which was nice enough, though the service was painfully slow.  The downside?  PRICEY.  As a vegetarian there were limited options from the apps and I wasn't in the mood to drop a bunch of money on entrees."}
{"text":"Went there on the spur of the moment this evening for dinner. We split the lollipop lamb chops as an appetizer. So good. Hubby had the rainbow trout with a cherry sauce and I had one of the specials:Grilled chicken breasts with a garlic Parmesan sauce. We both cleaned our plates.  We were also given the opportunity to sample the salmon and pesto flatbread. And we definitely will try that the next time. Jordan,our server, was amazing and tied the whole experience together. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A lovely place to have a good meal. The atmosphere was subdued and pleasant. We could talk in almost normal voices. The food was quite tasty. When in Pittsburgh we would go back."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try Cafe Sam for some time after having a nice time a few years ago at the bar. I made reservations for Valentines Day, in which a Pre Fixe menu was offered. I had a terrific appetizer of Naan bread with cheese and homemade sausage, steak and cabbage soup that was unique and quite good and a main course of Salmon with a General Tso sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious with a side of sweet mashed potatoes. My wife also was highly complimentary about her meal, fresh breaded calamari, a salad wedge with an Asian dressing,  a German breaded pork dinner with spatzel. During the whole dinner a server walked around to each table offering samplings of various tasty appetizers. At the end ... Homemade ice creams and terrific dessert offerings. Done?  Nope... Included was a glass of champagne with strawberries, and then...with the check chocolate covered strawberries!!!. Service? The waitress was super friendly and the manager/host Dan was known by all. Definitely a place of regulars who know a good thing when they find it. To say that my expectations were exceeded would be an understatement. I am recommending this place without any hesitations and we definitely plan to return with friends. Well done Cafe Sam!"}
{"text":"Cafe Sam has a cool Pittsburgh vibe. It's a bit funky but the food is good and interesting and their menu offers a lot of choices. I went with a group and we all had the Prix Fixe menu. It was a little bit pricey, but I think it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Appearances can be deceiving!  From the outside, it looks like an old house, but on the inside, such a cute romantic date restaurant.  The service was superb!  The server was very attentive, but not overbearing.  The food was reasonably priced with large portions.  The menu was quite overwhelming with lots of choices!  I will definitely return again to try something else!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden hide away with great food. With personalized dishes cafe sam's amazed my taste buds. The dining room is severely out of date, everything in there is from a different era. The service was sporadic and kinda of odd at some points. I think the waitress didn't have much experience, she seemed kind of young.  Overall the food was great and I'll probably be going back to try it again"}
{"text":"Cafe Sam is one of our all time favorites and definitely a regular for us. The menu is huge and I've never had anything but great food with nice friendly service. It's so easy to get a good meal at a great price at this quaint and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"The mannequin in this place is really creepy and weird.  It throws you off because you would think that the place would be horrible if they keep the creepiness flowing, but it does give you something to talk about.  And amazingly enough the food is good, creative and the service is not bad.  I do notice that we have gotten newer, nervous server the last two times that I went.  Well, those were the only two times I have been.  She didn't screw anything up, but had to ask us many times it was o.k. to do this, or the other thing.  Not a big deal because she was nice and thorough.  We got the frog legs for appetizers and also the calamari.  Both item are breaded and not really that impressive.  I have actually had better calamari other places and the frog legs were kind of just o.k.  It was kind of a, hey, let me just try this for fun kind of thing because it is an exotic sort of item.  For my main I had roasted red pepper and basil pasta which was really quite good.  I really enjoyed it.  I think that alot of people would like the fact that Sam's has a wide, wide, in fact huge selection of menu items.  I don't always need an oversized menu.  Usually, if a place concentrates on a smaller range of things it comes out with better quality.  Sam's is bold in attempting to tackle all those items.  Most times I think that they pull it off.  My only gripe is that maybe they could change up the beers a little bit.  Maybe feature a few local offerings from small batch craft breweries.  Yah, they are always a good place to go for some solid eats.  Cheers guys!"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for an open house weekend at Pitt. We were so impressed with the food and the excellent service that we came back twice during our stay. A new favorite in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is the strangest place, but I love it!  From the outside, I would guess this place used to be a funeral home.  It's very strangely decorated on the inside.  The main dining room is a weird pink and green, extremely dated and in the middle of the room, there is this huge odd fake flower display.  That said, the food is super yummy!  They give bunches of samples while you are waiting.  The wait staff is really nice.  I had the filet mignon and it was amazing.  Others at the table got different items, and I tried a little bit of everything.  All very good.  The menu is really strange, and like another said, there is no theme.  But, everything sounds good.  I have never been a huge fan of the Pittsburgh dining scene, but I really like this place despite its odd decor.  Skip the faux fancy pants places and try this.  (Oh and it's also very reasonably priced)."}
{"text":"We were volunteering at the dress for success and the stuff there recommended this place especially for their cookies that they gave to the customers after their meal. Maybe because it was a Thursday, this place wasn't busy at all. We were quickly seated. The waitress was quite nice and quickly explained the menu. To be honest, they have a lot of options for you to choose from plus today's special, everybody's will be able to find something that they can eat there. I had a steak sandwich, some people in my group ordered burgers, pasta and soup etc. there are three reasons that I am giving this place a three star review. First, I went to wash my hands after place the order, the lady's room was quit small which is ok, I walked in and the toilet flush was I guess not functioning from somebody used it before. Second,  the steak sandwich has 6 slices of steak I think, and each one of them were like half inch wide and 3 inches long. To have you see a vivid picture of how it looks like is  to look at your fingers, skinny fingers. And the bread part were normal size but compare to the steak it was overwhelmingly big. But the taste was ok, standard, ah, of course that wasn't enough to fill me up. The last, this meal took us 2 hours. Yes, maybe they weren't expecting a big group. But 8 person meal shouldn't take that long. At the end, they did gave us some cookie, some people in my group liked it, it was chocolate cookie but very thin. For me it was too sweet and too much chocolate chip. The owner was very nice and gave us some extra cookies before we leave after knowing that some one recommend their restaurant to us and spoke highly about their cookies.  Overall, it wasn't an awful experience, but it wasn't some place that I would go back again or recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"This place, in a word, rules. My wife and I went on Monday night, which happily turned out to be $4 house wine night! Chardonnays in hand, we perused the menu, which is quite the daunting task. They've got a wide array of stuff on there, and usually, that's kind of a flag for me. A lot of places that offer that wide a range of stuff tend to be...well, just okay at a lot of foods, not great at many.  Cafe Sam, though, was delicious across the board. Our calamari in General Tso sauce, our Ahi tuna skewers, the zesty housemade Buffalo chips, my gigantic, 12-ounce burger at a perfect medium rare, my wife's angel hair pasta with langostino...I was impressed by all.  We went late in the evening, so we missed the rush. The dining room was pretty much all ours, and we struck up some conversation with the manager, who was very friendly but not intrusive to our date night. She brought us samples of a couple different dishes, like their pigs in a blanket (a slice of all-beef frank with bell pepper relish, cheeses, wrapped in a toasted tortilla), the aforementioned Buffalo chips (served usually at the bar), and a yummy shot of mulled rum apple cider.  The service was excellent, the food even better -- and the dessert? Four words: Jager. Root Beer. Float. I hope whoever dreamed that up got a MacArthur grant, because they're a freaking genius.  I should also note, the prices on everything were great -- you get a lot of bang for your buck. Without a doubt, I recommend.  Oh, and be sure to ask about the mannequin at the bar; it's a neat story!"}
{"text":"A low light ambience without the distraction of kitchen noise in the background makes this a good place to go if you like conversation as much as food. There is also a bar in the adjacent room, with a friendly bartender and a low key feel to it. You can wait on the front porch before being seated at a table as well. I think this would be a good place to bring a date or for a small gathering of family or close friends. Dress was from general business down to shorts and a t shirt with most patrons somewhere in the middle.  A wide variety of tasty options was available on the menu and I had some trouble picking between them. I went with the salmon and was pleased. A medium cooked steak, ordered by my dinner partner, came out as a rare, and after we brought it to their attention, I'm pretty sure they just microwaved it in the back. Service was 4/5."}
{"text":"Huge menu, reasonably price, extremely mediocre food, with a nice plate of chocolate chip cookies with your bill.  I ate here when it first opened 20 years ago and it was good back then.  But over the years it has gone down hill.  Way down hill.  I won't go back.  It kind of reminds me of food you'd eat at when you are stuck in an airport."}
{"text":"If you are in Pittsburgh, this place is a MUST. Amazing food, atmosphere, service, location... 5stars all around. My family went for my sister's doctorate graduation & everything we ordered was delectable. Ask about the specials! This is a place that truly cares about your experience & you can feel it. You can feel the family, love, and hard work that all attribute to the amazing atmosphere of this restaurant. Support this local business, because it is the best. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place should be packed every single night! The staff is well trained, so polite and really some of the nicest people around. The menu offers a wide range, something for everyone. They were fantastic with our large group (aging from 5 to 65). I can't recommend this place enough.   Oh! And the vegetable quesadilla was most excellent!"}
{"text":"Extreemly dated on the inside- the menu was pretty broad, everything from lots of pasta selections lamb, to duck, to burgers and hotdogs..  We had great drinks, appetizers, salads, and entrees."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh (restaurant or otherwise)!  I am so happy I found this place as a student at Pitt in 2004, and I have been going back as often as possible ever since, and highly recommend Café Sam to anyone traveling to or living in PGH. The staff there is dedicated to providing excellent customer service and serving consistently delicious food and drinks. They are friendly and welcoming, always. They will answer questions and provide suggestions not just about your experience at their restaurant - but also about your experience in their beloved city of Pittsburgh! Reservations are not always required, but can be helpful.   The manikin at the bar (mentioned in other reviews here, and that you will surely not miss when you enter the restaurant) is Samantha .. she becomes a welcome part of the Café Sam experience (even if she gives you a little surprise the first few times) .. you'll never have to sit alone at the bar :). You can even try one of her signature martini's! The drinks here are delicious - full bar, several draft beers and extensive bottled beer selection; good house wines and selection of bottles of wine as well. In the last several years they have had house-infused vodkas as well that I'm still wanting to try.    On my last visit there I stopped for lunch before heading back to Philadelphia .. I had their delicious ahi tuna tartar for an appetizer, then their cajun seafood caesar salad - delicious, hearty portion of shrimp, scallops, mussels, langostinos on a bed of fresh romaine with house-made Caesar dressing. Both delicious! Over the years I have enjoyed trying many of the items on their extensive menu (and ordering them again and again or trying something new .. still haven't tried it all!). I love that I can go to this place and thoroughly enjoy my meal no matter if I am craving pasta, salad, seafood, steak, duck, chicken, sandwich/burger, tacos, dessert .. .. and often end up being surprised with a new item on their menu or specials list to enjoy. Some of my favorite items are .. their salads (entrée: salmon salad, seafood caesar are my favorites, but really they're all spectacular, including appetizer salads).  Pasta: angel's hair & sun dried tomatoes (sometimes I add chicken), penne & tuna - I usually get the 'appetizer' portion if this is going to be my main dish .. so I can try other appetizers/salads, etc. & maybe have room for dessert. In their steaks/chops/filets section - really you can't go wrong .. strip steak w gorgonzola & red wine demi-glaze is my go-to, and the other options look delicious as well (mmm, veal, lamb, or pork chops!). In their veal/duck/chicken section, I love their veal medalions; picatta style is my favorite preparation of this and chicken (I find it hard to find chicken or veal piccata as good as this anywhere), and their duck preparations are awesome as well! I would also comment that while my taste for liver was never cultivated, family who has accompanied me to the Cafe' has enjoyed this dish there, which can be hard to find. In their seafood section, my favorites are the pecan crusted tilapia with banana rum sauce, the ahi tuna steak with artichokes, olives, capers and pommerey sauce, and their bearnaise salmon. In addition ot these items, they have many delightful lighter entrees like sandwiches, burgers (love the bourbon BBQ or blue cheese turkey burgers!), quesadillas and on and on! Pick and choose from their a la carte menu or enjoy one of their prix fixe options .. a four course meal for $22.95 .. awesome. There are options on this menu for all dining budgets .. very affordable options and also opportunity to splurge on multiple courses of fine food and drink.  In the warmer months, they have a great rooftop patio. They also accommodate large parties whether in their downstairs dining room or as private events in their 2nd floor dining room.   Make sure to save room for a delicious sweet treat that will come with your bill as well (whether or not you order one of their fabulous desserts)!  I can always expect and enjoy hospitality and overall dining experience second to none at the Café .. whether for a quick bite or special meal.  I hope others try this place and enjoy the same!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday evening.  The service was rather slow but in the end the food was good.  I had the salmon salad, the filet was a nice size and I felt full after eating.  My boyfriend had the pork chop dinner which was also good. We chose the place because were were looking for a low-light ambience which Cafe Sam has but the service made the experience a little less than desirable.  OH..the drinks.  I ordered a Riesling which didn't quite taste like one (more bitter/dry than what I've tasted before) and my boyfriend ordered a Yuengling draft which he said tasted watered down.   Meh..it was an okay place."}
{"text":"It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago: the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain-glass windows; the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine; the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon; and framed 80's posters of the same color scheme grace the walls.   The menu is marginally more updated than the decor. Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g., the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing). Overall, the menu is too long and rambling without a theme, covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean.   The food was unremarkable. The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette; it was served with olive oil and powdery parm (i.e., from the green can). For appetizers, we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches. They were probably the highlight of the meal, but the portions were tiny, and the ingredients were not the best. For the main course, I tried their fish taco, which was on the bland and dry side.   Summary: if you are ever nostalgic for \"fine dining in a small American town during the 80's,\" this place is for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant.  The menu has something for everyone.  We have brought out-of-town guests to Cafe Sam many times. We've also celebrated holidays at Cafe Sam.  We have never had a bad meal.  If you're looking for a friendly setting with delicious food, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"For a quirky, memorable dining experience, Cafe Sam is the place. The ambience is as unusual as the menu with a unique floor layout and an eclectic decoration mix from a mannequin to Native American wood carvings.   As for the menu - which is extensive - you'll find items like Buffalo frog legs and pasta with craisins or with a Thai chili cream. Our party of four ordered each of these dishes and they were the best of choices (albeit the frog legs were uncooked at first. The kitchen was happy to finish the job and they ended up being on the house). We also ended up with complementary cookies at the end.   The service was first-class and extremely professional - like a $$$ restaurant - adding yet another odd element into the overall experience.   Tip: The odd dishes are the tastiest. Try the pasta with blackened cod and craisins."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here, but it always escaped my mind, being on Baum with a variety of 'fast food' places...but a work lunch brought me here last week.    What a wonderful little place!!!  Very reasonably priced, at least for lunch.  Good lunch portions, and delicious!  I had the angel's hair and salmon, but with garlic butter sauce instead of the pommerey.  I was afraid the garlic butter sauce would be just simply that, but there was definitely a hint of creaminess in it as well, which was perfect.    Also, they have a parking lot, which is more than many restaurants in the Bloomfield/ Shadyside area can say!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Cafe Sam I have been very disappointed.  On my most recent visit, the waiter was overbearing, the menu confusing, and the food unremarkable.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I see a lot of people in the reviews being unfair about silly things. . I'm personally not one to be picky. Every time I've been to cafe Sam I've had great food, great service, and a unique experience. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. And if you get the chance, definitely sit outside in the warmer months. TIP: they do seafood REALLY well: If you open your mind going to Cafe Sam, you will have a wonderfully delightful time. It's truly an underrated gem."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but a bit bizarre at times.  I had the wedge salad, which was pretty good. I thought the pickled egg was an interesting twist. I prefer a regular hard-boiled egg, but I thought it was clever and tasty.  I also ordered the gyro wrap, which ended up being gyro meat and a partial Greek salad wrapped in a green tortilla. I think I know what they were going for (a twist on a classic), but missed the mark. The tortilla didn't add anything to the meal, but really took a bit away. There's a reason that a pita and Tsatsiki are inextricably linked to a gyro. The pita substitution is especially unforgivable given that it has no flavor, and removes a flavorful component. I wouldn't consider that artsy or clever... Just a bizarre decision, perhaps for the sake of being different. I loved the Cole slaw it came with, that was creative, but unfortunately it was overpowered by the exceptionally larger proportion of compote, which was interesting, but clearly did not belong.  Finally, I had pecan pie ala mode, which was delicious, but again almost ruined by a bizarre decision. On top of the ice cream and pie were sprinkles. I'm not joking... I'm actually talking about little colored sprinkles that you'd find on children's ice cream. I think they were going for whimsy or color, but it wasn't. It felt like it was tossed on because someone must have overbought sprinkles and thought \"how can we get rid of these?\". It was unappetizing biting down on sugary crunchies when eating pecan pie.  Overall, the place was fine. Some of the food could have been really good. But, a lot of the time, I was thinking... What in the world is the chef thinking, here?"}
{"text":"I came to Cafe Sam with high hopes.  Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu, we all decide on what we want and order:  French Onion Buffalo Chicken Medallions  Fish Tacos with salsa and guacamole Cheeseburger (medium) with apple sauce and potato salad Side of Fries Water and Iced Tea with Lemon  Bread with butter, olive oil infused with pumpkin, and our drinks soon arrive.  ALERT: The tea is flavored.  I really do dislike flavored teas, but I put extra lemon in mine to cover the foul taste and continued on.  The bread was slightly aged as the crust was somewhat hard.  The olive oil was fairly tasteless, but fresh.  I would never use a light olive oil for tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did.  While it was an interesting thought to add pumpkin seeds -- this is the current theme -- they didn't add that much to the oil.  At least the butter was soft rather than frozen.  As we planned work for the next next day, our Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived.  They need to remove the \"s\" from Medallions as there was only piece.  In fact, they need to remove \"medallion\" and \"buffalo\" from the name and call it something else.  It was just a piece of chicken breast dredged in Cajun seasoning with a few stray strands of cheese melted on it.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad; but a better name would have been \"Cajun Chicken Breast\" rather than what they call it now.  As I ate the chicken, the French Onion Soup arrived.  This crock of soup looked exceptionally good.  The cheese on top was browned to the proper point.  I took the spoon and cut in with a voraciousness as I could taste it already.  When I put the first bite in my mouth though, the flavor was flat.  I took another bite and it was the same thing.  This wasn't French Onion soup with layers of flavor, but an onion broth that had some cheap, melted cheese on top.  It didn't taste bad, but anyone could make this soup.  I ate half the soup and passed it on to my friend to finish along with the rest of the chicken breast.  I didn't want to eat too much and then not be able to eat the main course.    As my friend finished the soup our entrees arrived.  The cheeseburger was served on a piece of a larger sesame baguette and came well done rather than the requested medium.  I didn't try it due to the fact it was overcooked and had sesame seeds.  I did try the apple sauce and the potato salad, though.  The potato salad was just not tasty.  One bite and I didn't want to take another.  The apple sauce, on the other hand, was quite tasty -- I wouldn't call it apple sauce, though.  It was more along the line of fried apples -- some damn tasty fried apples.  As I wasn't having any of the cheeseburger, I ate all of the fish tacos.  The tacos arrived presented on a sprinkling of iceberg lettuce.  I would think that they should make it a bed of lettuce or just omit it all together.  I am for the latter over the former as I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- no nutrients, just water.  While the fish didn't have bad flavor, it was a tad overcooked.  When I started to eat the tacos, this wasn't a big deal.  As the fish cooled off, though, they started to get too hard for their own good.  The fish tacos need to be cooked less, especially with the fact that they are using white, flaky fish, which is easily overcooked.  At least the guacamole was fresh and tasted good.  All in all, this was a lackluster event.  If not for the fried apples, guacamole, and great service this would have been a one-star.  I don't know that I would ever willingly return since I was in sticker shock when our server brought our check.  The price was not commensurate with the quality of the food.  People complain about the quality of the food at Ritter's diner, but the food is actually commensurate to the price that you pay.  When I pay over $20 a person to eat, I expect better than diner fare."}
{"text":"Great experience. Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers. Most of the items we had for dinner (appetizers, entrees and dessert)"}
{"text":"We were in town to watch a Pirates game. We normally stay downtown, but the hotels were all full. We stayed close to UPMC in shady side. When we checked in Cafe Sam was suggested for dinner.   We got to the restaurant at 4:50, and while it didn't open until 5:00, we were still seated. Got a great table on their rooftop patio. Waiter was excellent, timely and very good.   We ordered the fried cheese, a spinach salad and a wedge salad to start. None of it was traditional. All had a little twist. The fried cheese was awesome - buttery , lightly breaded and tasty. Spinach salad dressing was probably the best I have had - wedge salad - meh- ok, nothing great.  Entrees - Gorgonzola steak - excellent - well cooked and flame grilled. Pork chop with jack Daniels sauce - sauce excellent - pork overlooked.  Succotash as a side was wonderful- buttery   No complaints- a little slow to get the first part of food. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I am very to report that Cafe Sams is closed after 30 years of delicious food and good service"}
{"text":"Very tasty food tonight but everything was cold from the escargot  to the main entrée. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had a negative experience here with both food and service several years ago, but agreed to join friends there for dinner. It was déjà vu all over again. Service was good, but my meal was terrible. I ordered fantasy chef salad, which had a pile of hot meat over the greens, a combination I found very unappetizing. By the time I found the small amt. of lettuce at the bottom of the bowl, it was warm and wilted. The turkey tasted really bad, like it had been overheated in a microwave. They forgot the cheese and there was one piece of tomato and a few tiny pieces of fruit on the rim. I should have sent it back, but I was with a group and they all seemed ok with their meals (tho no one was raving) so I decided not to complain."}
{"text":"We are visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend and someone recommended this for a quick bite to eat. The entire place smelled like sewage. It was really bad."}
{"text":"Where do I start.. The place has a very 1940s feel with a nice old fashion bar! The menu is massive - so if you have picky company it is a safe choice. The food takes a little while, but it is because they actually have a kitchen and not just a microwave. The waitress will read you a long list of specials that take like 5 minutes. This is not the place you go to if you are in a rush. This is the kid of place you go for a nice birthday/valentines dinner. It almost seems like a fancy place, but the food is so cheap! It is hard to find a place that has a nice meal with a protein that is under 20! I had the Jack Daniel whiskey butter pork chops and a side of mac that honestly I am still dreaming about, which I think was around 15 bucks. I highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"The food is below par and you are limited to two mixed drinks. The decor is odd and outdated.  In need of Gordon Ramsey!!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight and it was amazing! I read that it was hard to get seated so we made a reservation. We were seated as soon as we arrived. It was not very crowded at all but that could have been because it was late. We had the ahi tuna tartar and Italian sausage for our appetizers. My boyfriend had the porterhouse with parsley potatoes which came with a vinegar base slaw and baked apples. I had the filet with pasta which came with the same slaw and apples. We also had the pear tart for dessert... Everything we had was delicious!! I would recommend giving this place a try for sure. It will likely become our Friday night date spot! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent service. Staying at the family house on Centre Ave and this restaurant was a nice place to relax and eat a good meal. The hospital doesn't offer healthy choices in their cafeteria so I appreciated the change.   1/12/14 update. Ate here again...two nights in a row. Food was great but service was pretty bad. Waitress not attentive at all...made assumptions about me being finished,  never checked back to see if everything was ok, never asked if I wanted anything else. Gotta drop from 5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Their stroganoff is amazing! They have different specials everyday so variety is good. I go their every time I'm in Pittsburgh doing hospital stuff since its about 10 minutes away from UPMC. I had one occasion where the food was burnt but I said something and they immediately fixed it. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. Like a candle lit. The people are friendly, and not overbearing or intimidating. They know their menu and make it a goal to cater to everyone's dining needs. I go here every time I come to pittsburgh(:"}
{"text":"Decent American fare with a handful of creative explorations among the specials. Service was a bit of a disaster - waitress was very pleasant but our tab got misplaced in the kitchen and food was a very long time coming (incl the starters!). They worked hard to make up for it though and kitchen staff came out with apologies and free dessert."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Beef tips in the pasta were underwhelming. Very ordinary. Service was nice though"}
{"text":"Great flavor, nice ambiance, and delightful evening."}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday to meet a friend for dinner.  Had nice rooftop seating as the weather was great.  I ordered the CAJUN CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD with Parm cheese.   What I received was some sort of odd salad with leaf lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, olives, cranberries, cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple and some oddly coated cold chicken.  I did not get any romaine lettuce or parm or croutons.  The server returned some 20+ minutes later and asked how things were, and I asked her what she had served me and she was quite puzzled, and said she must have placed the wrong order.  She offered to make me another but at this point I said no, I'd just pick on this one as my friend was nearly finished eating, and she said she'd try to adjust the bill.  Well the bill came and not a dime was reduced.  I am sadly disappointed no steps were taken to rectify their mistake.   So, I ended up charged $9.95 for a barely edible odd salad.  Please note, this is why you were only tipped 10% on a nearly $30.00 check."}
{"text":"The first sign should have been an empty room. I ordered a steak take out. For being a New York strip, it had no flavor and was tough. The sides looked old and were not appetizing. The fork and knife provided were of the cheapest quality and made eating the steak interesting since the knife couldn't cut even into the steak. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!  It has a wonderful rooftop, and the owner was very accommodating.  However, the chef was off his mark.  I order the Strip off the specialty menu, and it was very overdone.  When they replaced it, the inside was so raw it was blue (still mooing).  By the time they cooked 2 steaks, my friends were finished with their meal, so I didn't eat my steak.  I didn't complain, but when the waitress took an entire steak back she should've known something was wrong.  I feel like our waitress was pretty new to the position as well.  There is a lot of items on the menu here.  Unfortunately, the old adage is often true... if you have a HUGE menu, you very rarely are a master of any of it.  Recommendations:  Cut your menu in 1/2, and make your food great!  3 STARS.. because I think this place is cute!  The owner was fantastic and attentive, the waitress tried hard.. but the kitchen missed on 3-4 entrees and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Roughly 18 years ago, I came to Cafe Sam with my mom and sister on a weeknight after work and tried escargot for the first time in a bowl of pasta.   I wasn't taken by it.   However, I do remember a gracious musician/server and a fabulous wedge of Oreo Cheesecake.   That having been punched out on my keyboard, I was looking for a place to keep my birthday weekend alive and stompin', especially when Kay and I needed a meal prior to a Saturday night concert in Millvale. Cafe Sam had been unfinished business for the 6 years since I created my Yelp account. A look at the large and varied online menu was promising. To the Bloomfield/Shadyside border we drove.   Cafe Sam's interiors are antiquated, and its patrons reflect that. Dressed in concert garb, Kay and I felt a bit out of place amidst the senior citizens, dim lighting, and funeral wake ambiance. Nonetheless, the host was eager to seat us and guaranteed us that we would have a pleasant time, but that wasn't to be.   To begin, the service, while friendly, was a bit awkward and inattentive at times. Refills were slow to arrive, and whether or not they were free depended on whether or not a server or the nervous hostess told you. Also, when Kay and I  each requested a serving of the Chocolate Banana Creme Brulee for dessert, Kay inexplicably received a piece of chocolate cake instead. I felt terrible for her since my dessert was a rare highpoint of the meal, even if it was actually just a cold and scrumptious pudding with a crackly exterior and quaint garnishes. 2 complimentary chocolate chip tuile cookies somewhat made up for the confusion (Cafe Sam's baked goods and ice cream are bought from outside vendors. The creme brulee is one of their few housemade desserts...).   Our appetizer, the Country Style Pork pate, was inexcusably dry and might as well have been a slab of ham. Lazily dabbed with a particularly pungent mustard, the condiment happened to be the dish's only flavorful ingredient.  In another strange instance of clumsy hospitality, Kay and I were offered a sample of lukewarm fried cheese cubes. Later, after we'd already been served our side-dish portions of Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, the hostess brought us more of the same side-dish. Kay thinks they might have been trying to use it up, and its mostly insipid taste (save for the salty, smoky bacon) and watery composition was a telltale sign.   The sinfully sugary warm apple compote heap (or whatever they call it) that came with my Rainbow Trout entree was another nearly meal-saving item that I probably would have rather had inside a crepe topped with whipped cream the following morning for brunch. If you order the fish, you'll be given a choice of sauces to top it. I chose the pecan butter, and it was the lone part of the main event that carried with it any sense of taste, the trout itself being woefully underseasoned and limp.   If gentrification puts Cafe Sam out to pasture, I won't be depressed over it.   P.S. I too saw the mannequin and thought I was in Anton LaVey's basement for a second. Creepy, man, creepy."}
{"text":"3 Stars for the Food but 5 for the Service makes this 4 stars solid in my book.  My mom and boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner. No reservation required as it was pretty quiet. My mom and dad ate here all the time back in the day when we lived over near this neighborhood. They typically went for lunch and not dinner but the dinner menu sounded good too so we had to try it! Interestingly, my BF and I had had breakfast at Ritter's across the street earlier in the day, and I remember seeing Cafe Sam on our drive to and from Ritter's and wondered if it was any good! So I was pleasantly surprised when my mom suggested we eat there.  Our server was truly wonderful and I wish I had remembered her name.   The manager(?) and other waitstaff came by with little samples for us to try like warmed apple cider (yum!) and some type of chili chicken which I unfortunately had to forego because it was spicy. Nice way to let customers sample other items on the menu without committing to an entire order, since the menu is massive and there are tons of options... (I really had a difficult time deciding myself!)  I had mussels as an appetizer, and fettuccine with pink sauce as a side, since the other sides did not sound appealing to me that particular night. For an entree, I ordered veal Oscar, and it was cooked exceptionally well. It came with Bearnaise sauce which was tasty and did not taste 'powdered.' FYI - \"Oscar\" style here means the Bearnaise sauce plus TONS of seafood on top (shrimp, mini scallops, huge mussels...but no crab meat!) The entree also came with coleslaw and spiced apple slices, both of which I tried a tiny taste of but did not eat since I didn't like either and I knew I was gonna be full really fast, lol. Ended up taking them home in a to-go box for my dad.  The negatives for me? Initially, I wanted to order a Caesar salad but they ran out of it. I also wanted to order shrimp bisque but she said it was a bit spicy, and there was no mention of that on the menu (thankfully I asked before ordering it...I would have felt guilty sending it back), and so instead of ordering soup or a salad, I ended up getting the mussels as an appetizer, but turns out my veal Oscar came with mussels (and shrimp, and scallops...!) so I would not have ordered the mussels as an app if I had known this...I would have tried something else instead since the menu is huuuge and there were tons of delicious sounding options. I heard other waitstaff apologizing to other guests when they had tried to order other items that they were out of, so while the menu is pretty vast, they might not have certain items in stock...just bear that in mind, and have a few back-up options just in case!  ;)   Also - while the seafood was verrry plentiful on top of my veal, it was also fairly overcooked and thus had a nasty, bitter, fishy taste to it. Ick. I scraped it off and tried to enjoy just the Bearnaise sauce and veal instead. :( Very disappointing, but the veal was cooked perfectly so I did not mind as much!  It is worth mentioning that nearly all of our meals had some type of 'green sprouts' on top...I am not sure if this was a seasonal ingredient and hence they had a surplus of it and wanted to use it up or what....? It just seemed like it was thrown on top as an afterthought and not so much intended to be/designed as a part of the dish.... and on the pasta, it tasted really bitter and I opted to remove it which was a little bit of a pain since it was all mixed in. But did not detract from the pasta sauce which was tomato-y and verrry tasty. (Though definitely ask for some Parmesan cheese on top!)   Also the mussel app does not come with bread or garlic toast of any kind and the bread basket did not come out until later so I was a little bummed about that. I probably could have asked though and she would have brought me some.   House Cabernet was delicious btw.  Didn't have room for dessert (after eating so much food, oy!) but they do bring you these really tasty, flat, crispy chocolate chip cookies with your bill which was a nice touch.  Decor is somewhat whimsical and this mixed with a semi-formal dining environment makes it seem reminiscent of a place like Max & Ermas (esp with the goofy mannequin at the bar, which I loved) and yet it's definitely not a chain restaurant, being the only one of its kind, around for many years... I guess what I am trying to say is I like the casual aspect of it yet there were formal aspects as well. A seamless blend, IMHO.  Worth a trip, though you might want to ask that they slightly undercook your seafood, and ask LOTS of questions about what comes with each item on the menu as this was not explicit and I probably ordered too much food because of it. (Or anticipate numerous doggy bags for a hungry family member at home!) ;)"}
{"text":"Very wide range of good and great taste v"}
{"text":"The food was yummy except for the hamburgers, which were burned.  The service fluctuated...the bar was unattended for a good bit of time.  The table service was excellent.  The manager sent mixed messages about how to handle payment for a large group and that was a little frustrating.  All in all it was a nice evening, especially for a large group."}
{"text":"The restaurant operates out of a renovated brothel...my brother and I dined at the bar...which had various house infused liquors...(maple whiskey...peppercorn vodka...cherry vodka...pickled gin... Dirty vodka..others)..we ordered the buffalo chicken medallions for appetizer...which were at best average ...my top shelf long island was average....food delivery was slow and the bartender was occupied for a whoke before taking our order...the bathrooms are dated....it seems like this restaurant is catered to 50+...the dining hall was not busy but our appetizer took nearly 20 minutes to come out and our entree over 30 minutes..my snapper was average on a bed of collard greens.  ..whipped sweet potatoes average again and creamed kake was definitely average.  ..the host brought out complimentary marinated mushrooms which were pretty good after our dinner...our dessert was chocolate cake a la mode..which was a cold cake with a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  The chocolate cake again at best average...the bill came to 90 with my brother ordering the cod and a beer. I had a Bailey's on ice which was probably the best thing I ordered..."}
{"text":"So the food here has always been pretty decent and a few of my faves include but limited to are as follows: Pittsburgh pierogies Pan-fried provolone French onion soup Wedge salad Filet mignon"}
{"text":"I had a fine time at Café Sam. The menu is humongous with many different options. The prices are reasonable. They have a variety of food options, some ethnic including naan, which makes you want to come back and try different dishes. However, they were out of a few dishes we wanted to order. They were stingy with the before-dinner bread. The service was good. The taste of the food could be improved. Also, the ambience could be improved. I'm rating it a 3/5 for eating environment and taste. I would recommend this restaurant for casual dining. Overall, my experience was okay, not amazing, but not horrible."}
{"text":"Food was really okay. I ordered porter house steak which was rather good deal except it was really bland. I added more salt and black pepper myself. Also really strange waitress I asked for soda. She forgets. I was fine with that since I probably don't need a soda anyways. I asked for steak sauce like a1 cause the meat had no flavor, she said \"okay,I can get that for you.\" She brought back ketchup. I know some places don't have steak sauces like a1 which is fine, but don't bring me ketchup to eat with steak. She must have thought I was an idiot, which I am, but seriously don't pass Heinz Ketchup for a steak sauce. Just repulsive.... I rather eat the steak without the ketchup. Just tell me the place doesn't have it, don't give out ketchup and says it is steak sauce. What a cruel waitress."}
{"text":"I love going to Cafe  Sam for dinner. All the people that work there are nice to me and others."}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem, Café Sam was a great experience.  Just like a very typical Pittsburgh Place it was a converted house which was very quaint.  The inside was very eclectic but very welcoming.  Our serve was Rachel; she was very friendly and attentive.  We started out with a serving of Pan Fried Provolone and the Smoke Shrimp.  The Pan Fried Provolone was extremely flavorful because the pan frying gave great crisp without the oily taste from deep frying.  Also with the pan frying the provolone really infused into the bread crumb coating.  Café Sam does all of its smoking and the smoked shrimp really proved that having smoked sea food takes the flavor to the next level.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the smoke was not over powering and it was enough to elevate the flavor in the shrimp flavor.    We next had our main meal, my daughter had the Angel Hair Pasta and Shrimp, My wife had the Fresh Chicken Buffalo Style, and I had the home smoke pork chop and sweet Jalapeno and Chipotle sauce.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce my daughter chose was a cream garlic sauce.  The cool thing about Café Sam is the Chef gives you a choice of multiple sauces per dish.  It can be a little overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it, it is nice to have the choice.  The shrimp was done to perfection and the sauce was the perfect match with the shrimp.  My wife's Fresh Chicken Buffalo Style was also prepared to perfection.  The chicken was not dry and the seasoning wasn't over powering to the chicken.  The top of the night was the special Home Smoked Pork Chop.  The smoke provided the Pork a sweetness that only just the right amount of smoking can give pork.  It was moist and tender and very flavorful.    As I said Café Sam was unique, we were serenaded by one of the waiters and let me tell you he was good.  Unfortunately the outside was not open this evening because the outside looks like it would it would be great time to eat el fresco.  I highly recommend you try this place it is a great experience."}
