{"text":"There seem to be Hero Burger restaurants opening everyone in Toronto, but I can't imagine why. Their burgers taste pretty mediocre to me, it tastes almost like the frozen burgers I used to buy at the supermarket and cook on my old George Foreman Grill. They have lots of toppings, but for any of the non-standard toppings you need to pay extra so it's not really worth it.  Additionally, last time I was there (I've been to this location twice) I got a burger and poutine to bring home for my roommate. I live less than 10mins walk away, and as I was walking back the bottom of the bag suddenly ripped open and the burger and poutine fell onto the sidewalk. Thankfully the burger stayed wrapped and the poutine container stayed closed. Neither the burger or the poutine packages felt greasy, so either the bag was just not strong enough or one of the employees put the bag into water/grease/whatever before handing it to me. Either way, I would've gone back to complain but I was already almost home and didn't feel like walking down Yonge Street carrying a poutine in one hand and burger in the other!  Actually their poutine is decent, that's the only reason it gets two stars. If I'm craving poutine I might go back, only because there's nowhere else nearby to get it. Compared to somewhere like Burger's Priest, there's simply no competition, BP wins easily. Hero Burger is too expensive, the food is mediocre, even the bags are terrible."}
{"text":"This was a second choice as The Burger's Priest was rammed.  I just wanted to see what the big deal for this place is.  It's got a better choice of toppings than a Harvey's and they also take their time in preparing the meal.  It wasn't packed in there so I got a hot burger.  The onion rings were deep fried and probably of the frozen kind.  Not the greatest but far from the worst. Rob Ford can keep his Hero Burger."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and clean and they have a great pop dispenser, but the food was awful. I got a hero burger and it was cold, the cheddar cheese was not edible and they forgot all of my condiments. The fries were mushy and not thoroughly cooked as well. They just opened up so maybe they just need more time/training."}
{"text":"Yonge and Sheppard location of this popular burger chain. Very tasty and well cooked to a standard, they are consistent with their service and food during my multiple visits to this location. One thing I like about hero burger is the videos of where their food comes from on the walls. You can see how it's grown, where it comes from and what goes into the food you are eating. Hero burger is definitely a premium burger shop with prices to match, you can easily spend around $15-20 per person on a combo if you add cheese or anything extra but I feel like seeing the videos of how the produce and meat is treated help to justify that cost a bit as you can see the care they put into selecting quality ingredients. Hero Burger has some of the best poutines in the fast food chain game in my opinion. Their mushroom poutine is my favourite, a bit on the pricey side but damn it's good stuff. I usually go 8 oz with aged cheddar cheese for my burger and Jalape√±o is safe as they aren't too spicy. Ice cream is good too!"}
{"text":"Ok but for fast food, they have pretty great grilled chicken sandwiches, it didn't feel too fatty or salty. The service here is also wonderful. You're greeted with a smile and nice conversation. Definitely my regular takeout place."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. Burgers are very greasy, and the poutine is not the best, but what can you expect from a fast food chain? The place a very disorganized and dirty, and the service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"I love my Hero Burger. The service is always good and the food always tastes fresh.  Whether or not it actually IS fresh is another topic.  Regardless of fresh or not, Hero Burger satisfies my cravings. It is expensive because of adding toppings and special things like mushrooms or special sauces. I would compare Hero Burgers to places like Five Guys, Harveys, etc.  and Hero Burger is better than all of those places.  Comparing it to Burger Priest is unfair because Burger Priest is in a class all its own...plus they have the All mighty God on their side so totally not fair.  All in All if you decide to get a Hero Burger, you will not be disappointed if you add the special sauces and toppings that make a burger super yummy. Their fries and poutine are very good as well."}
{"text":"Really hit and miss. If you get a good cook it might be worth it but you have to be very choosy. All burgers are frozen, cheese is not real. The price is way too high for the quality. I often see the MANAGER cooking in the back with no hair net and no gloves. I've heard people complain about hairs in their food. Would not recommend unless you want to get sick or get an alright but frozen burger."}
{"text":"Plenty of indoor and patio seating. Upgraded parking for 3 cars! What more can you ask for? A good burger? They have that too!  Aside from the \"usual\" burger, they have a few specialty burgers. Definitely worth the try.   The fries were a miss today. The oil was a tad old. Additionally, I think they re-fried my batch because I asked for the fries to be well done. The fries definitely tasted heavy with oil. Next time, I'm going to order \"fries well done, as a new batch - not refried, please.\""}
{"text":"Great customer service here. The lady who works the counter is great! The soul burger is amazing, their onion rings and sweet potato fries are always perfect and they have a huge selection of drinks. The restaurant is pretty clean and there is parking."}
{"text":"The burger patty and fries were soft and moist. It was the best burger meal I had in a long time!  I'm not sure why the other reviews are complaining about the food, because what I received was better than the McDonald's, Harvey's, Burger King, and other places I had been to in the past few years. I've experienced things like dry patties, overcooked dry fries, stale-tasting buns and other ingredients. It got to the point that I assumed this mediocre taste was normal, and what I had at Hero finally broke the trend.  The drink machine at this place was an interesting novelty. From a touchscreen you selected the flavor you want for a large list, which can be searched by flavor, sugar, etc. Whereas a normal drink fountain has about 8 choices, this machine has probably 20 to 30 - including 5 or so different flavors of (artificial?) fruit juice. You also have the option of half-watered down versions, if you prefer to have less sugar. Having so much choice on the drink, it's kind of fun.  I'll give this restaurant or this chain another try in the future, to confirm that what I experienced wasn't just a lucky fluke."}
{"text":"My burger was cold, the cheddar cheese was not real cheese if you ask me.. More like plastic, fries were mushy.. And they forgot my condiments. They just reopened so I will try again in 3 months... Maybe."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because the service is friendly but the burgers are just not any good, especially for the price. The cheese is tasteless and burgers are obviously frozen patties.   You'd do well to just go to the 24 hour McDonald's up the road (much cheaper) or further south to a Burger Priest (much tastier)  The milkshake and onion rings were fine though so I suppose if you wanted something like that it could work.   No go on the burgers though."}
{"text":"Hero is a somewhat more premium chain burger place, and I like the signature burgers they have here. Last time I came here the burger was cold, that made it an instant disappointment."}
{"text":"I was hesitated to buy my first burger here after reading the reviews. I got one veggie burger...with an egg and cheese...surprisingly awesome! Juicy and fresh and the veggie patty is done right! Would recommend friends to there."}
{"text":"I love this place. My friends and I go at least once a week. The food is awesome and the pop dispenser is cool. I've never had a problem with the staff or food. It's always cooked fresh right when I order it."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger aficionado, but I do appreciate good toppings. I've been here a few times since the location is convenient, but they do seem to struggle with service speed. Let's call it \"faster-than-average food.\" The staff seem very eager to please - they gave me extra premium toppings due to a slight mix-up...so now I'm a big fan of the smoked cheddar cheese. I always order the turkey burger and the fries are decent. I'm sure I'll be back here at some point this year."}
{"text":"Great friendly service at this location. Burgers are solid. A little on the pricy side for a burger fix but hits the spot."}
{"text":"Caesar poutine has my heart and I've got Hero Burgers to thank for that.  Fills you up good and then wash it down with their wide selection of pops (decaffeinated choices available).  Pricier...yes, and service for me depends on who is working in the kitchen. It can be slow and I'm sensing this happens when a new member of the crew gets lost in translation between toppings and frustration.  All in all, we come here for the poutine and a drink to avoid long waits when famished!!"}
{"text":"It takes them forever to make a freaking burger! Nobody knows what they are doing! Not the first time here! Every time its the same thing! Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"I am not sure whether all Hero locations are same or not but you need to wait too much in this place. Also there were small bone pieces in the burger patty. Low quality, slow service!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side for the burger. It was good but I don't think it was that good. I got their signature 4oz burger and a side of fries and a drink and it came to about 12 dollars. Given I understand their burgers are supposed to be good quality but it seems to be overlooked and on the dry side every time I get it I think I've only had it juicy when I got the 8oz burger which I would imagine is hard to completely overcook.  I've also tried the poutine combo with no burger and it's a decent deal for the price around 8 bucks. Get quite a bit of cheese curds and bacon on top. I tried the caesar poutine. Their fries are good and it tastes like they use Renee's caesar dressing on it. It's not bad.  Over all it's a step up from McDonald's but nothing to be raving about. I was expecting a bit more for the price point and the inconsistency in cooking puts it down to a 3."}
