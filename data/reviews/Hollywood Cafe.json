{"text":"Been here before when the crowd was as good as the food. Now not so much. Crowd is shot and beer and food sucks. Had wings to go, under cooked. Ordered dry Cajun to go. Both times under cooked wings and no seasoning. Stay away unless you want a shot and beer and bad food from a smokey bar. I give this shit hole 6 months.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Hollywood Cafe the other day and it was ok. Had driven by there a million times and thought that it was time to try it out. Fairly large menu primarily filled with bar food. We ordered some appetizers and I had a small order of wings. I will say that they have a bunch of wing flavors and I was not disappointed. 

However, the place does allow smoking and I noticed that most of the patrons were doing just that. Nothing extremely special about the place and since I'm not a huge fan of smoky places, I don't think that I would go back unless I was with a group that wanted to go."}

Ok, lets start out with the good.  I just moved to this side of pittsburgh and was looking for wings (my usual story for finding new places) and the place that I was looking for looked like a mafia hideout from the outside so I doubled back to this place that I passed on the way.  Looks like a dive from the outside and in a lot of ways it is but let me tell you why its special:

Food:  I've only had a few things here so far but everything has been awesome.  $2.95 gets you a CROCK of lobster and crab bisque.  Not the best i've ever had but its above average and what a value for the price.  I've also had the steak sub and its made with shavings of loin...tender and delicious.   

Chris might be the best bartender that i've encountered.  EVER.  Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, knew how to sell food, and even entrouduced me to regulars to stimulate conversation.  I've long said that bartending is very little about pouring drinks and Chris embodies this.  Unfortunately some of the other staff fall under \"below average\".

Regardless i'm amazed how empty this place was with how good the food was and reasonable the drink prices were.  Get out there locals!!  Go give this place a try!!"}
