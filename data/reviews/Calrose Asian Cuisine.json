* Their House Green Salad Ginger Dressing is EPIC for dipping the sushi into... also their teriyaki sauce rocks. 

SUPER fast delivery and they drivers are always so kind and happy. Truly a gem this place."}
{"text":"Affordable prices compared to other sushi restaurants in the area. It's a cute restaurant and very clean. It's pretty much your standard sushi menu, however they have an extensive Thai menu as well. The servers are friendly, and food comes pretty quick."}
{"text":"This place is closed down. Looks like it will reopen soon under a new name something like Green Pepper Thai."}
{"text":"newly renovated japanese place. I live in the area and see new vendor all the time and give this new place a try.  Wow! They nailed it. All of the stuff that come in my combo is fresh and so tasty, even the salad dressing.  I also takeaway with me the spicy salmon roll, and it's so fantastic.  The spicy salmon sauce is so tasty with a kick of real spice. I will be returning customers."}
{"text":"The new owners have done wonders with this little place.  I was pleased to see one of my favourite dishes (saut√©ed green beans ) on the menu.  The lovely hostess / server Shirley was very helpful explaining the ingredients in the dishes.   I would like to see more beef dishes (Beef Teraiki) on the menu.  Other than that I enjoyed the Chinese and Thai dishes that I sampled and hope the new owners will have a long and happy stay at this location."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place on St. Clair. The food is so good. They do both Thai and Japanese which I think is so great! Really like their salmon pizza, spicy salmon and massaman curry. I tried to call them today to place an order and no one picked up. Hope they didn't close down:("}
