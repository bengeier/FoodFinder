{"text":"I love this place! They use only the highest quality fish and they have fantastic service.  You have to ask for it, but they are one of the few places that have authentic fresh wasabi, not that fake green paste that everyone else has.  I would recommend this place as one of  the best \"off strip\" sushi joints in town."}
{"text":"Excellent little sushi spot. Service and good quality is what sets them apart. owner/Chef Jospeh makes extra effort to make the experience fantastic. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Friendly service and nice atmosphere. The restaurant is a little on the small side and was very busy, so things took a bit of time to get to the table.  Owner Joseph stopped by to see if we were enjoying the meal. He was very nice and even walked us out as other people have said. The food was fantastic and very fresh. I had a \"Small\" Sushi and Roll Combo Party Tray. It came on a nice sized boat and was delicious."}
{"text":"very nice and the staff greeted us kindly. Love the pink accent lighting. Sushi was really tasty no complaints. Waiters were nice and awesome, they got us our food fast. Omg! tempura ice cream was SO GOOD! They only served full roles so it was a lot of food and you couldn't try more rolls."}
{"text":"Have been here for take-out lunch several times before and all was good. Service was quick and food was good.  Not today though.  Came in around 12:20PM and one of the four waitresses noticed me standing near the \"Wait to be seated sign\" (she was near the bar). She said \"Hi\" and then disappeared.  So I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited and waited. After 5-6 minutes of waiting, none of the 4 waitresses came over and asked me if I wanted to be seated, or if I wanted take-out or anything.  No one said a word to me and no one came over. So then I started to feel like an idiot just standing there, and so I left and went down the street to Spicy Tuna. Spicy Tuna was busier than SushiWa, but they took my order almost immediately as I walked in.  So sad SushiWa!"}
{"text":"Tried this somewhat hidden joint tonight for dinner! The prices were slightly higher than what we normally pay ($60 for two) but the sushi was good and well worth it! We weren't expecting much when we walked in since there were about 10 tables and only a few people inside, but after we were seated the restaurant filled up and had a few turn overs and lots of people taking out.   We opted for the lobster roll, Chirashi don, and sushi/sashimi/tempura bento box.  The sushi and sashimi was fresh, and they had many different kinds of rolls to choose from. They offered sushi rolls without rice and more unique rolls like torched rolls, deep fried rolls and a large variety of fish.   On top of what we ordered, they offered us tempura noodle soup, Edamame and miso soup on the house.   I was particularly fond of their tempura tonight. Everything was fried perfectly with the right about of crisp and no soggy oiliness that you get at some places.   All in all it was a good experience. I will probably go back during lunch though, since the prices are significantly cheaper then!"}
{"text":"The owner Joseph was very personable and the food was great.The Geisha & King roll were delicious and I quite enjoyed the salmon sashimi donburi."}
{"text":"We had AYCE which was awesome!!! The presentation as well as the quality was the best.Lots of choices and a great and comfortable atmosphere. I almost gave them 5 stars except the service was a little slow.Sushi Wa is my new go to place for Sushi."}
{"text":"The inside looks SO much nicer than the outside. Decent menu selections. Our waitress was very helpful in recommending the AYCE and finding things my little kids would like. Both my hubby and I felt the sashimi was a bit fishy although it looked beautiful. The rolls we selected were pretty good. I'm partial to another sushi place up the street but I think this is a good back up place."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. All farm raised fish, but the service was good and the food was very nice. There was a roll with lobster that was to die for. Much better than the other places in henderson"}
{"text":"First time coming here, my expectations were high as a I frequent many sushi spots around Vegas. I heard good things about Sushi Wa so I was very excited. Upon coming in, I was greeted and was seated right away. The ambience of the place was casual and soothing. Not many people were here because maybe it was around 9 pm on a holiday weekend.  I sat at the bar and was immediately asked if it was my first time here by the chef. I said yes, and he told me to ask if I had any questions. The food selection is great with many variations. I  chose to wat AYCE and I definitely got my money's worth by eating here. I ordered and I got my foos right away. Also, Chef Joon oppa was very accommodating and nice to me. He was friendly and made me feel very welcome in his sushi restaurant. With that, I have been coming here regularly.    Food:  fresh and consistent  Ambience:  clean, casual, and relaxing (music is not too loud) Service:  topnotch as always"}
{"text":"Albacore with Jalepeño on top was delicious. Service was awesome, ambiance was great. It's definitely a nice quiet location for business or a date."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night with the family and no wait. Fast service and great food as always."}
{"text":"I've been to many AYCE sushi places around town, but this one has, by far, the most rice and the least fish.  All the rice you can eat, with a little fish on top. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Really good sushi and rolls, fair priced and the owner/chef is super nice. Will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Excellent. I ate lunch box with friends.  There were nice service, everyone was very friendly .  So I enjoyed lunch time.  Thanx"}
{"text":"Great stuff! Service is quick, servers are kind and check up with you time-to-time, food is great, and for AYCE, there are NO LIMITS TO ICE CREAM :D"}
{"text":"This place a neighbourhood gem. It was my sister's birthday today, but we were tired and just looking for something lowkey and in our area. She was in the mood for sushi and we ended up at Sushi Wa. There is one server to the place and it's quite cozy. She gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and tried checking up on us until we took too long (oops). We did eventually order and food started coming out pretty quickly, but well-paced afterwards.  She first brought over a radish roll of some kind, with mango and avocado. I was bewildered, and asked if we had ordered this. She said it was on the house! It was delicious and wonderfully crafted. She then brought out another roll which I can't quite remember what was inside. But it was also delicious and complimentary! Lastly, we got some noodles and soup which was flavourful and refreshing. What a great start!  We then got our food. My dad got the kalbi dinner which was tender and plentiful. My mom got a salmon teriyaki bento. And my sister and I overindulged in a small sushi sashimi roll party platter. The party platter was a sushi boat, basically, and had cute added touches of carrots carved into the word \"HAPPY\" and a radish with carvings on it as well. The sashimi was fresh and sizeable. The sushi could have used a bit more wasabi to stick them on. But they were also individually garnished with green onions and other accoutrements depending on the kind of fish. Beautiful presentation. The rolls were good, but nothing too spectacular.  The truly great part of this place is the service. Joseph, one of the sushi chefs (and I presume the owner), came to our table towards the end of our meal to ask how it was going. He introduced himself and asked us how everything was. We said it was delicious and my mom mentioned it was my sister's birthday and we thanked him for the complimentary rolls. He thanked us, and walked away. About 10 minutes later, the lights were dimmed, a cheesy Happy Birthday track played on the speakers and he brought out a little sushi pizza with a candle on it. It was so nice! He then offered to take our picture and printed it out for us right there.  Joseph also remembered our names by the end of the night and personally walked us out and opened the door for us. He seems like a nice owner and made lovely food. We'll definitely be coming back for the service and the good food too."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  All you can eat was good.  Liked the korean bbq short ribs. Good to know they're open til late night for a sushi place"}
{"text":"SushiWa is a very trendy looking restaurant, which will throw you off on entrance, because from the outside it looks like a mom'n'pop operation. However once you roll in its definately upperclass.  the interior is very spacious, with private booth seats, regualar tables and an expansive bar area which we graciously occupied.  You can get the regular-whatever's-trendy in west LA fancy rolls here, but we befriended the Head chef (by ordering daiginjo sake and pouring a round to all the chefs;-) ) and asked for Chefs choice (Omakase style) but on the traditional side... and it was just crazy good! I think the constant Kanbai's with the chefs helped, cuz we got all the usual, but high grade toro, ikura, uni etc, but he also showed us a flying fish, live and whole, then fillet it before our eyes, and we had flying-fish sashimi, garnished with flying fish wings. Ditto with the Uni Rice where the rice was mixed with seasoning and Uni and served inside the Uni shell. I don't recall all that we ate here, i lot of stuff was new to me, but thats part of the fun in going to a new restaurant! oh they had Orion beer here too, which is a plus. The head chef also showed us a picture he took with the Princess of Belgium? who is apparently a regular there, but what i couldnt understand was, what the heck is the Princess of Belgium doing living in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant for the first time recently and the sushi, sashimi, and service were good. The fish was fresh and tasty, cut well, and the additional dishes were also nice. The personal touch is also very nice. We ordered a sashimi combo that came with soup and salad (we paid for upgrade to seaweed salad), some additional sashimi a la carte, edamame, AAC roll (avocado, asparagus, cucumber), plus a green eel roll, and added another miso and seaweed salad.  The food was straightforward, fresh, and filling. It's a simple, smaller, comfortable place. The fresh aspect on sashimi is super critical for us to be happy. We were happy and plan to return."}
{"text":"CAUTION:  Seven of us went to try out this restaurant because we heard good things about it.  We were craving all you can eat.  It didn't begin well and it didn't end well.  When we sat down the waitress in her 40 or 50 with short hair came over with a not happy face.  We were trying to order our drink and she wasn't patient and just said I will bring you all water and hot tea.  We had a toddler with us and had to stop her from leaving to order our child an apple juice .  She did not seem happy.  Near the end of the meal we were satisfied except the rice has a weird vinegar taste.  However, we had left some rice and shrimp heads on the plate.  She informed us that she would have to charge us for not eating everything.  SHRIMP heads.  Not everyone is gonna eat that.  Come to our surprise she charged us an additional $35 for these items.  It is only $27 per person for all you can eat.  We were also automatically charged a 18% tip because we were in a group.    Moral of the story.  If you order all you can eat from this place be prepared to eat everything or they will charge you.  We won't be coming back and we will tell everyone we know not to go there."}
{"text":"Seriously? This place gets 4/5 stars? I'd give them 0/5 if there was only an option. Ok maybe 1/5 just because of the screaming orgasm and ama ebi. Service was awful. The server, Mark, we got was very rude right from the beginning. Really, why will you question our quantity of orders if we could finish it? Every time we order \"Are you sure?\" It made us very uncomfortable the whole time especially when we try to order. Just awful! Never coming back! Nigiris have very thin slices of fish portion; rice portion was a lot. They try to make you full because of the rice not because the fish portion. Also after the first batch of orders, we noticed they take longer time to get our orders out. Place wasn't even full at that time. There are other much better sushi joints around town. Friendly, better service, and muuuuch better tasty sushi. Pass on this one!"}
{"text":"THE WORST SUSHI PLACE EVER. Nothing for a 5star rating. They tried to keep the good rating by offering some complimentries like free ice cream, some rolls. Especially, the one of free food which was a deep fried one was extremly stinky. They do not throw old and stinky tuna away, just put in a roll and fry it. You never know it is a kind of garbage tuna when you eat with deep sauce. Also this restaurant is very old and takes a lot of time to get food. The sushi man keeps move out of sushi bar to greet people and say goodbye to people. It would be a good a service but he is not a waiter. Foods are below average quality. People who gave 5 stars may have gotten a lot of free food."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice, trendy atmosphere with upbeat music and they serve hands down the prettiest sushi I have ever seen. The flavors though, are a little hit or miss. They were not particularly busy when I went, which was surprising for a Friday night and we got good, attentive service. A lot of their rolls are very unique. Some of the rolls were phenomenal (like the pocky), but some of the flavor combinations and their sauces really did not work for me. I also got some nigiri where the fish did not taste fresh.   Overall, this place is a decent all you can eat option in Henderson but there are better places in other parts of the valley."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and this is hands down one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas! The atmosphere is amazing and it's decorated perfect. There are a mixture of booths and tables that are all spaced out perfectly so you never are too close to another group, unlike some other sushi places that can be very crowded and you feel like you're sitting with the table next to you. I always get the AYCE sushi, such and amazing deal! The cucumber salad is some of the best I ever have had, and I have never not enjoyed a roll I have gotten. Unfortunately I live on the other side of town now.. closer to places like OYSHI, but every time I go somewhere else I just miss this place terribly. The staff is always super friendly and the owner is usually there and says hi to tables. My one friend is a regular and they always take great care of us and everyone who dines there. I truly recommend this place for anyone who lives sushi, it's THE BEST! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great portion and quality of sushi, this is our first time being here, the sushi is freshly made and good price too. I'd recommend it for anyone craving for sushi during busy weekdays~"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times. The first visit was with a sushi group from meetup.com. The fish is as good as it gets in the middle of the desert hundreds of miles away from the ocean. The rolls inventive enough to keep your interest.  The service while attentive isn't top notch. Too many rules to follow should you choose the AYCE option. Tonight, while entertaining friends from out of town, I had a truly unpleasant experience paying the bill. Without looking at the check, a credit card was presented and charged. They added an additional 20% gratuity and labeled it as TAX. Then they added sales tax to the total INCLUDING the gratuity.  When we questioned the charge, the manager said they automatically add a 20% gratuity to parties of five or more. I pointed out their menu states 18% on parties of SIX or more. He said they've changed policy but have not changed the menu. SAY WHAT? Had to argue with the manager to have the charge reversed. Told him that if he didn't immediately reverse the charge, I would dispute the charge with the credit card company. Time to find a new sushi bar."}
{"text":"Decor 2.5/5       Small, used, old, utilitarian; bathroom dirty. Booths small and not that private. Feels a little \"authentic\".    Service 2.5/5     Nice enough. Slow. Not disciplined servers. They forgot about me couple times. Took too long to get any drink. Chefs are asian and seem well qualified/pro.   Food 4/5     Free tiny appetizers x 3 nice touch.  Green Salad was average but cold and fresh.  Agedashi Tofu and Miso soup good.  Ebi Shumai below average - flavorless, too dense and jello-like - sauce unbalanced/too vinegary.   Sashimi was fresh. Slightly above average. Inconsistent slices (ie big salmon chunks, too thin sliced tuna).   Overall - 3 to 3.5 Im sure this qualifies as some people's 4 star sushi place.  Overall its not bad. Just rough around the edges - but based on good fundamentals (authentic caring chefs and fresh product). Value is there. Im picky - a 5 star sushi place needs to be nearly perfect or blow my mind. This is not a 5 star sushi joint. I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little gem that our friend George/Debbie introduced us to.  I've been to a lot of sushi places in town and seemed like with the all you can eat menu's, everyone seemed to be cutting down on overheads.  It's always we ran out of this and we ran out of that.  To our surprise, everything we ordered was delivered.  Food was excellent, and presentation was fabulous.  The service was 5 stars as well.  Definitely recommend this place to all of my family member.  Will come back again even though we travel from Summerlin."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here randomly and fell in love with it. The combinations of flavors were unlike any other sushi bar I've been to. The fish was fresh and the amount of rice that came with the all you can eat orders were little. The restaurant itself was beautiful. Very clean, modern and inviting.  We will be back and can't wait! Despite being across town."}
{"text":"Sad that I HAVE to give one star.  We came in tonight as it was my fiancés birthday. He looked all over yelp to find a good sushi restaurant that he has never been to as we go to them all the time. We saw good reviews and decided to dine here but I will say it will be the first and the last. I am not a fish eater at ALL! I always order my regular katsu chicken. When my fiancé ordered ayce and I didn't it seemed to be a red flag to the waitress. Needless to say we know the rules are for ayce and she made them clear several times. Almost to the point that she was accusing us of sharing. We were there for about 2 hours and after our initial dish was served she came rarely to see if he wanted anymore of his ayce sushi. Which is unacceptable. I mean to be served 3 times in 2 hours with no refills even on our water let alone sushi is nonsense. The food was not amazing and the service terrible. Sorry to the others who chose to dine here based on the yelp stars."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible!! Very unprofessional. Our initial server, Geo was amazing, friendly and professional. When he left we got this server from hell. It was almost as though an exorcism needed to take place. She told us that we only had 19 minutes more to eat our food and that she would not bring out any other food because \"we had been here too long. \" According to my last text to my friend letting her know that I would be there soon I know the we were at Sushi Wa for no more than 45 minutes when she told us this erroneous claim. In addition, we did not receive our food on time after what Geo had given us and couple of the orders were for other tables. Save yourself trouble and go elsewhere. By the way, the store owner ended up calling Gio back to the restaurant because this was such a serious issue. Harassing a customer is never ever acceptable. And she never apologized., but Geo and the store owner did for her.  Don't risk it if the waitress from Hell is still working there!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, great atmosphere and modern pop music. Would recommend 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I eat out at least 5 days a week, and this was the worse experienced ever.  The food was good and well presented.  It would have getting a 4 stars but the service took them down to 1 star.  There were 3 of us and we all getting AYCE.  It was almost 30 mins before our order was taking.  Even we sat at the sushi bar, the waitress takes our order not the sushi chef.  The order then put in to the head Chef and only then the other chef only make what the head chef tell them.  After finished our first orders,  we wait another 20 minutes and the waitress never came by, finally my friend stop her as she dash through and rudely, raise her voice at my friend, \"YEAH!!!\" my friend reply, \"can we order?\"  she gave him a mean, dirty, irritated look. It seem that we are inconvenient them.  As I look over to my friend, I noticed the waitress was complain to anther waitress and pointed at us.  And I can only assumed that she was complaining how much we order.  Even we only order 3 items each time.  We thought that we were having AYCE???? are we not??? I can deal with the slow service  but straight out rude to our face,  It got me so pissed off that I want to write a review right there and then. Then my friend did not know that one of the dish that he order was consider a sashimi, he thought it was an appetizer so he order a sashimi plate,  instead reply nicely she sound like she was wanting to fight him that he already order 1 allow sashimi per person. I got my order and another 30 minutes gone by she finally come by and wonder if we need anything else,  my friend say that he still waiting for his order and she act surprise after she notice that I was on my phone writing a review, she was nice and apologetic.  Then she ask if my daughter and I want anything else, we told her that we had order desert from the other waitress 20 minutes ago.  At this time All I want to do is get out of this place, before my blood pressure goes up."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent here pretty much every time we want sushi. It is by far the best sushi bar in the Vegas Area. Prices are good, sushi chefs are amazing, and quality of fish is paramount. Our regular Sushi Chef Waldo is our favorite from all the sushi places we have ever been too, and he does great work. Beautiful and artful plating and great cuts of fish. He always remembers the first thing I always order when I sit down, the Superman Burrito, in my opinion the best roll ever. Definitely give this place your business!"}
{"text":"There is no negative things ~~  Food was really good ^^ and very friendly environment ~  100 %sure coming back for sashimi and sushi"}
{"text":"We go here all the time for their half-price sushi promo that runs from 11-3. There is no better deal in Henderson! The sushi is pretty good (WAY better than any other sushi you can get for half price) and the service is fast and great."}
{"text":"Not so good. This was my second time at Sushi wa, the first time, it was okay with a good server that my friend knew. I went back because the presentation of each dish was nice for the All you can eat Sushi. with drinks, it is around 35 dollars with tips. I think i deserve better service. The server had to correct my friend when he pronounced the menu wrong. Also, she had to correct me when I did not remember what they DId NOt have. ( I personally think that all the items on the menu should be available and customers do not have to memorize what they have and not). Also, the server forced us to finish all the foods. like when we tried to order more, she said, \" you know you have to finish all\" and we said okay.   I wouldn't have to go there If i was going to get that service. I would have not went even it was a Free Meal."}
{"text":"Moving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, I have had a problem finding a decent sushi restaurant. Sushi Wa is the best AYCE sushi joint. You have a wide variety of rolls to chose from plus sashimi (AYCE places usually do not offer) and a great selection of appetizers. Extremely satisfied with this place. It is a little more expensive then other AYCE but the quality of fish makes up for that difference. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE place by far! The lady who greeted us was super nice and friendly, the food was super fresh, amazingly good and came out extremely fast! The two servers working (Jenny and Shenna) really made my night! Their service was phenomenal! They helped everyone find things they would like on the menu; they were extremely attentive to our table and not to mention hilarious! I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends. Great job guys! :)"}
{"text":"A friend invited us to try Sushi Wa a couple of years ago and we are still loving it! Great presentation!  Nice interior, too bad it's in a strip mall. One caution, don't tell them \"something REALLY spicy\" you might get ghost peppers. It took a few hours for the heat to die down. :-)"}
{"text":"Great sushi, the food presentation is very well done. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Only complaint is the music is horrible, dance club music is not appropriate for restaurants."}
{"text":"My first time here, the sushi is fantastic and full of great flavor. The restaurant is beautiful inside and the staff are professional and accommodating. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The following is my opinion of this establishment.  I WOULD NOT COME BACK.  I wish I could give this place 0 stars.... besides having very bland and in my opinion not fresh fish (I have been there twice - hoping the first time was just a fluke, but it wasn't), last time I was there I SAW 3 COCKROACHES behind the sushi counter!  IN PLAIN SIGHT!  Also, I saw a different kind of bug in their bathroom.  Someone PLEASE PUT THEM ON DIRTY DINING.  Then to make that even worse, I saw a sushi chef drop a piece of salmon and then wash it off.  SERIOUSLY?????!!!!??????  If I hadn't paid for AYCE, then I would have just walked right out right there.  I asked to talk to the manager and this Korean guy named \"Joon\" asked me what the problem was, and when I told him, he said that was not possible.  I said I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.  He said I had \"my own interpretation.\"  So, when the bill came, I paid it and didn't tip (obviously).  Then as I was walking out, the waitress asked why I didn't tip her.  I said that it was because the place was horrible and there were bugs, then I walked out.  Then that guy Joon followed me to my car asking why I didn't tip!!!  He harrassed me and my friend IN THE PARKING LOT, only 20 minutes after saying that I was wrong when I saw bugs at his restaurant... so then he was saying that I had to tip... and I said that the menu said gratuity was added on for parties of 6 or more, and I was only a party of 2, and frankly ARE YOU KIDDING ME????  Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice layout. It's small and there's only a few tables. Most of the tables are separated by a divider so it feels more private than other restaurants.   The food is good! And the people are nice :)"}
{"text":"I work close by and we go here every week. Great service and amazing sushi. You can tell the chef (and all employees) really have a passion for sushi and go the extra distance to ensure you are enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"Mos def Good! I'm from Hawaii & know fresh fish- this place has good tasting sushi rice with great appetizers & sushi is pretty fresh - service lacks somewhat - order everything at once cause after that it takes long & u fill up while waiting - strategic planning to get u full lol"}
{"text":"Came to this sushi place on Sunday night because my bf & I were looking for a sushi place open after 9pm around the area. We seen the reviews on this place and agreed to try it out. When we first walked in, we noticed that it was very small (probably 5 to 6  tables). We were seated at a booth & decided to order the small sushi & sashimi combo (35 pieces).  The waitress served us  2 complimentary dishes which were fried brown rice sushi with tuna & edamame. The sashimi came in 10 pieces and was not too thick and not too thin. The sushi was good and their rolls were not filled with alot of rice. As for their customer service, it is amazing( why I'm rating this place as a 4 star). The owner took his time to come up to our table to thank us, get to know our names , introduce himself and check  if everything was okay. He also served us icecream which surprisingly came with corn flakes. In summary, I would recommend and come back to this place."}
{"text":"They have great nigiri sushi. Its better than going to a buffet where the sushi has been sitting out on the counter. Instead you keep ordering a little bit at a time and all your sushi is fresh. I love the pepper seared ahi nigiri and garlic ahi (garlic ponzu sauce drizzled over ahi sashimi) nigiri. Anything on the menu is game for you to order and as much as u want (they limit your uni and ama ebi to one per person). You can pay dinner price during lunch if you want sashimi. I recOmmend that if you are there for lunch to just pay the lunch price because whatever sashimi you may be craving you can order it as nigiri. Examples of things to order are specialty fusion sushi rolls, nigiri, salads, tempura, bulgogi, kalbi, teri salmon. Dont forget dessert...mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch with my friend. The Scallop roll is to die for! sushiwa is one of my favorite places to lunch in Newer henderson....it is so relaxing and the staff is friendly. The Sushi chefs are absolutely adorable!"}

{"text":"Great food & awesome experience whenever we visit. Joseph (the owner) makes sure we are extremely happy with the food we ordered."}
{"text":"I just finished my shrimp tempura roll and California roll, and I had to write a review for this place, because it is excellent. I'm new in town, and don't think I'll bother trying to find another sushi place in Henderson.   I didn't dine in, just got carry-out, but the girl that took my order was extremely friendly, was happy to accommodate my requests, and even offered me a beverage while I waited. I'll be back to Sushiwa soon!"}
{"text":"Having dinner with great friends. Food is awesome. Been here twice. Love this place. Great price for AYCE."}
{"text":"My family always comes here and only here to eat sushi. Why? Well their quality of sashimi is amazing. Always fresh and has the buttery crisp taste sashimi should have. Even the uni is good and not as pungent as other places. I've had all of their rolls and I think of all sushi restaurants you won't find another like sushi wa. Definitely should go here for sushi if you want quality and good price."}

{"text":"Great lil restaurant with friendly staff and great food. Came here on Friday afternoon for lunch with hubby and baby. Sushi was fresh, rolls were nice and slightly warm (just how I like it). Our waitress brought us apps on the house, which were quite tasty. Hubby had a sushi bento box and I had the lunch roll special where you can choose two rolls. Great value and prices!  The owner Joseph walked us to the door and we had a nice chat with him. You could tell he was proud of his restaurant and it shows with the great service, warm friendly smiles and great food. We will definitely be back!  One suggestion, I was trying to find a menu online to order takeout for a party, but can't find any menu online. Would be great if you could post one."}
{"text":"having been there several times I can say the food is good but their customer service is truly awful.  Just had my third and FINAL experience bad customer experience.  They do not even try tobe customer friendly.  They are doing you the favor - not like you are paying for their sushi."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite new AYCE location.  Great food and decor/ambience is better than others.  Fish was fresh and A+ for presentations."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here yesterday. The place is small but the food is very good! The chef and staff here are very friendly and attentive. I ordered the sashimi and the fish are very fresh. I recommend this place and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I really love this sushi restaurant!    Not sure why anyone would give this place a bad review...?!  I am a sushi lover and have been to VERY expensive sushi restaurants all over the US.   Obviously, fresh fish is the most important criteria for finding good sushi!    Sushi Wa goes the distance in this catagory.  Believe me, if it isn't fresh, I'd know!  Sushi Wa provides a very nice ambiance in their restaurant.   Semi circular booths and tables are all very comfortable.  If you want one of the booths, come early or see if you can arrange for a reservation before heading out to eat.  What is fabulous here, is the all you can eat menus for lunch and dinner.   Yes, they have rules, but the wait staff was very good in helping us with our choices and explaining the rules to us.   I thought the rules were very fair and simply created to stop people from ordering food they weren't going to waste!    Seems logical to me!  The sushi is amazing!    The presentation is superb!      Cons:   I would like to see the people who bus the tables do a better job of cleaning off the tables!      Sushi can be messy, and the tables need extra care in cleaning them.  Believe me when I say, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Ok this place definitely deserves a review. I kept seeing the great reviews so I had to check it out. The staff goes above and beyond. The food is great and fresh and they bring you many delicious items 'on the house'. A charming restaurant. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to try out Sushi Wa based on the raving Yelp reviews.  And we left with a bad taste in our mouths.  The food was ok. The portion size of sushi and rolls were small.  The place looked run down. The table was dirty/sticky. Our dining experience was certainly different than most others posted on Yelp. We did not receive any complimentary appetizers.  The service was lukewarm at best and we had to flag the waitress to place the order and for tea refill.  When we finished the meal, the waitress quickly left the bill on our table but went to greet 2 customers who took a long time to place their take out orders.  We finally got up to pay at the cashier and the waitress just stuffed the changes in my elderly mom's hand very impatiently. We also noticed that the waitress was much friendlier to Caucasian customers, considering here is Canada!? Would definitely not worth returning."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out party tray and was very happy with the quality of the sushi.  It was super fresh, balanced and fairly priced.  Would order from here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I was at a party with a friend and they said they were hungry, so I pulled up the Yelp app on my Android smart phone and search all restaurants that were still open in the area; it was about 10:50pm on a Tuesday.  Sushi Wa came up displaying a 11:30 closing time.  We got there at 11:10 and set at the bar, the owner came up and told us they closed at 11:30 and that our choices were limited.  I told them we only wanted Sushi and they said no problem. Roy and Ken were the chefs and did a great job.  I served them a few rounds of Black Raspberry Saki and they were more than happy to stay and talk to us.  Great guys and they really seem to love their job.  We ordered their version of a Screaming Orgasm which was very good.  It has a more liquidly dressing but is spicier. There was so much dressing left over that we asked for more Daikon. Ken obliged us with a mountain of the stuff.  We also had the Blue Fin sushi-mi on Roy's recommendation, which was excellent.  Sushi Wa is nicely decorated and very elegant. Perfect for a nice romantic date with plenty of booths that seem to be pretty private.  I will go back if anything just to see Ken and Roy again.  Great guys."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi restaurant out there. Food was amazing and the WA2 meal is extremely worth it. The service was amazing. Overall, I highly recommend this place! 5/5"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be good in the past but now it's just a disaster. Came in on a Friday night, waited for our food for an hour and a half and only got 4 rolls. The wait staff apologized repeatedly but did nothing to rectify the situation. The rolls that did come out were sloppy and fell apart as we picked them up. Definitely won't be coming back anytime soon unless they get their act together, there are plenty of other sushi restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!  Celeste  is the best   screaming orgasm roll is the most.  Clean and great service"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner. Food and service were fantastic. Joseph (the sushi chef) came to our table to introduce himself. Overall a great experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for sushi night. Nice location and the inside is comfortable. Tried many rolls and all were delicious and creative. Definitely try the XXX."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here last night.  The service was very good.  And the quality of the sushi was amazing.  A great place to get all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Superman burrito roll is an addiction! This place also has some of the freshest sashimi in town. I live in Summerlin and drive over here for sushi. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for a dinner, the food was good, but the customer service is the worst! Every time we ordered more stuff she always inpatient and bad attitude ! Let us Felt like we shouldn't order more, and she lied to us said the regular ice cream only 1 per person , and I told her I been here a lot it was always been unlimited for Ice cream! And she admit the Ice cream is unlimited , but she said \" you all had 2 ice cream already I think that's enough for you!!!!!???? Are you serious?! You going to a all you can eat place and a waitress tells you that you have enough ??? I don't think she's the owner that will worry the clients will eat too much ! I think she just so lazy to get us food!  I used to be regular here ! But definitely will never go bak ! The food is no difference with other sushi place , but getting treated like this so not wort it!  If you are looking for a all you \"can't\" eat place this is it!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and impressive. Loved how cozy it was. The chef gave us candy at the end and asked us our names. Probably the best service I've had at any restaurant. The lunch is a good deal and the dynamite roll was awesome."}
{"text":"So I had to hit up my old fav sushi wa before I headed out of town again and the new all u can eat (tear drop)......is BOMB!!!!!   At first glance I thought I might be disappointed because the use to have a half price lunch special, but has been replaced by the all you can eat and if anybody is like me they go in on the sushi when its good. The menu for lunch is pretty much all inclusive except for a few items like the sashimi and other more expensive items but every things a go for dinner. I fell in love with this place for their unagi and albacore, but everything is delicious and the portions unlike many other in Vegas are big.   Even though I've tried most sushi places in the city I always come back to Sushi Wa, so give it a try if you're in the neighborhood......and if you're brave try the oyster shooter which is included in the special, the oyster is huge but delicious. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Food: Excellent - All the pictures you see posted here are real and are presented beautifully - Reasonably priced - We received complimentary sample rolls and appetizers from the Chef: Mango roll, fried salmon roll, noodles in a broth. - Complimentary ice cream: red bean flavour was my favourite  Service: Excellent++ - Waitress repeated our orders to confirm - Chef came to our table and thanked us. You can tell he is quite passionate about his food and business. - Chef asked for our names to try and remember us for next time we come back. - Chef held open the door for us when we left. Thanked and shook our hands again.  Our Party: - Group of 5 - Quiet/empty when we first arrived on a Wednesday afternoon.  Overall: - This hidden gem deserves the 5 star rating. - I'm surprised this place doesn't have a line out the door. - We'll be coming back and spreading the word.  Suggestion for the restaurant: - Please post your menu online somewhere. I couldn't find it!"}
{"text":"I'm here at Sushi Wa for supper. This in the best sushi restaurant in Vegas. Their all you can eat deals a fantastic deal!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  They take forever to bring you a check, but food is great and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi, very cozy, you can feel the owner really loves what he does, great family environment, awesome prices, terrific service, its a hidden gem!!!!  5 out of 5!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so blown away by the quality of the food and amazing service of this small restaurant. The food was amazing! The chef even seared one of the white fish sashimi pieces to give the whole dish extra depth. The chef, Joseph, even came over and introduced himself and we introduced ourselves. Was such a nice place. Super impressed and highly recommend it. They even gave us lollipops (love it!)."}
{"text":"Sushiwa is by far the best sushi place in North York, if not the greater Toronto area. Joseph is the owner and in charge in the kitchen. Get used to seeing him because he will get to know your name and you'll never forget it!  Here's one of the nicest warm and kindest people you'll meet in the restaurant business and he will serve you until you absolutely cannot eat anymore. The food is 10 out of five. My fiancé and I go there as often as possible because it's nice to be recognized and it's also nice to be treated a little bit better than the next restaurant"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for the first time today, based on the reviews on Yelp. The food was great!!! The salmon sashimi was really fresh - and I must admit I am a sushi snob since I grew up in Vancouver. All of the sashimi, in fact was fresh. I also like how they have mini sized special rolls. This gave me a chance to try a few instead of just one. The tea service was continuous and the ice cream at the end with the cereal at the bottom was a nice touch. Best part - the sweetest sushi chef ever. He came by our table to check on us. At the end he walked us to the door. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is RACIST Last night my wife and I went to eat dinner here. We walked in and an another couple walked in right after us they went to the bar. We chose a booth. THE WAITRESS is attending us while I'm ordering during mid conversation I kid you not. She walks away with out letting me finish my sentence an goes to take the order from the other couple that walked in after us. She brought them water ect right away. Then she came back to my table as if I was going to carry on w my sentence how are you going walk away while you take my order an just disappear because the couple after us were the same race as the waitress . This place is trash fire the waitress . It's first come first serve . Not who looks like me gets first. We are ALL HUMAN . these people have no class ."}
{"text":"Been to Soho and thought they did have the best uni but sushi wa has better urchin...  The one star is for the uni alone.  Dined in just a few hours ago.  The host/ waiter was not very welcoming and the entire experience was ruined from the start.  Very poor service from the waiter.  I felt very uncomfortable throughout the night because he truly did begin the dining experience by being aggressive and not helpful (with suggestions, etc.).  It was my first time eating at his restaurant and certainly the last.  Maybe the food was fantastic but I am having a really hard time overlooking the horrible service aspect of the dining experience.    The biggest restaurant sin is when a waiter or waitress attempts to be nice(r) and/ or genuinely friendly towards the end of the dining experience.  Perhaps, that is a way of securing a good feedback, gratuity or a future visit?...  Nah, neither one was warranted because the service was such a disappointment at sushi wa.    I will never discourage anyone from trying this place.  Some of the dishes (especially the uni) were fantastic.  I will, however, caution to potential customers to be aware that the service can be rated a 0 out of 10.  Sometimes a balance of great food and excellent customer service is the best way of attracting and retaining customers... Tonight, I am walking away from sushi wa.  That's okay though... They seem to be doing well, anyways."}
{"text":"My wife heard of this place through a colleague. We've been looking for a good AYCE sushi place near our house, and I think we may have found it. In my opinion, this is the best AYCE in Vegas. Their menu is expansive and all items can be ordered (for dinner, some limitations for lunch). The one thing that got me for an AYCE was their uni (urchin). It was tasty and fresh, not the best i've had, but it definitely tasted the way uni should.  Other pros: The waitresses were so nice. One took my restless 1 year old for a tour around the restaurant and gave her some chocolate. So awesome.  Their rolls are creative. I strongly recommend the mountain roll and the superman burrito, soooo good. The screaming orgasm is also good, up there with I love Sushi's, slightly spicier which my wife and i loved!  Only cons were that the salmon sashimi tasted as though it was washed with water prior to serving, giving it a less fresh taste.  Overall, we've definitely found our spot for when we're craving AYCE sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is probably the best sushi bar I have ever been to. The food was amazing and the service was great too. Sushi rolls ranged from $8-$14. All in all it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This sushi spot has one of the best atmospheres I have ever seen for a sushi place. They offer comfortable half moon booths which also make for a great first date spot.   The service and staff were incredibly attentive, beverages were constantly refilled and food did not take long to arrive.   The one part I felt lacked was the food itself. The miso soup lacked in taste, I am not sure what kind of broth was utilized but I expected more from it. The sushi rolls, while affordable, were not incredibly distinguishable, it was not enough to make me come back for more.  It was ok sushi, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps it's due to the fact they offer \"all you can eat\" at a very affordable price ($27 at the time of my visit) which means they may have to skimp on quality.   While the atmosphere and staff really shine in the place, I feel there are better locations for sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Did Uber eats. I got the poke bowl and a ramen. Food was good. I was glad they pack the soup separate from the noodles. So I ate the poke bowl for lunch and the ramen for dinner. I will be dining in one of these day to check out what other stuff they got.."}
{"text":"Here's  the deal people on here don't  understand. Its all you can eat there's  a reason some rolls have alot of rice, the place needs to make money! If yoy want sashimi or low rice go with the ala carte option.They still have sashimi and sashimi salads on the menu which most AYCE places don't. The fish portions were good not extravagant but alot better then most ayce places. Also they had alot of appetizer options  which are unique and not skimpy  in meat or chicken. Also the most important  thing is that unlike every single sushi restaurant in that area this one has never been closed down by the health department."}
{"text":"Called late to make sure they were still open and thankfully they were. Showed up at 10pm for takeout and met the very pleasant staff. They were very welcoming and offered some tea and a small noodle appetizer while I waited. Driving back to my hotel I couldn't help but think was it worth the drive yet as I started to eat, it definitely was. Not only was the staff and chef super nice but he food was delicious. I will definitely be back. Well done Chef Joseph!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood & craving Japanese food. Saw Sushi Wa & decided to try it. So glad we did! First thing that impressed us was the menu sign at the door telling us they are open til 4am!! We were further impressed when we walked in & saw how nice the ambience & decor was. Some people were walking out as we walked in & I asked them how it was. One guy right away said \" it's always good!\". Because of what he said my expectations were pretty high - I was not disappointed! We decided to do AYCE so we could try as many things as possible to see what we liked. They had a lot of items to choose from. Our favorite was the kalbi (beef short rib on the menu). The only thing I didn't care for was the ponzu sauce they put on the nigiri I ordered. They did offer to remake it without the sauce but I decided to try it. I have just never seen it served that way. Our server was Celeste & she was great. She checked on us often & got everything we ordered right. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"- VERY slow service - Food is so so...not very hard to get sushi wrong as long as the fish is fresh. - Had the all u can eat, but had to cancel because it was SO slow  Overall, gave this place 2 chances already and they have failed to deliver."}
{"text":"Exellent food and service! 10 out of 10 if I could forsure haha! The people are friendly and the music isnt that bad either so I suggest you try this place out oh and get the california tempura roll its tops."}
{"text":"Wow! That's all I have to say, iv eaten at dozens of sushi places and I was really blown away by this place. Service was excellent, fish \"salmon sashimi\" was very fresh! I definitely will be coming back to this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The workers at Sushi Wa are the friendliest people I have ever met in my life! The chef personally came up to my table and introduced himself and asked how everything tasted. He also asked us for our names so he could remember us in the future. Impeccable service AND amazing food."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late dinner on a Saturday and discovered this little gem..open until 12:30am..AYCE $25.  Excellent service.  Nice decor.  The food is delicious and well presented.  This is our new go-to for sure!  Easy parking, tucked away in a corner strip mall."}
{"text":"Great food, nice environment and music.. Oh and they have the softest toilet paper lol would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This is my new place to go for sushi, by far this is some of the best sushi I have ever had. The service is great, the restaurant is beautiful, and the food is perfection. Extremely fresh and flavorful. Only negitive is the salmon skin roll, it was not very good quality for some of us who liked it in the past. However they did take the roll away from us for no charge. They even let us make a modification to a roll to add cream cheese, I can't count the amount of sushi places that won't. Great experience and we will be back here."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere. Server is really friendly and was greeted at the door. Food has good quality and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"So glad we stumbled across this place.  Amazing food,  amazing service. The crispy rice roll in my opinion is the best, but  everything we had was great.  The atmosphere is fun and waiters are very attentive. We've found a new date spot!!!"}
{"text":"Food was so great! Some of the best baked rolls.   Went on a Saturday night and they seemed understaffed. The service was so genuine and helpful when we couldn't make up our minds but soooooo slow. Luckily we didn't have anywhere to go.   Will definitely go back but we'll make sure we don't have any commitments after!"}
{"text":"I'm assuming this place is better during dinner time?!?   My daughter and I came in for lunch before hitting TJoes across the street. I've never been here until today. When you walk in it is quite impressive, tall half round booths, dark rich colors and a hip atmosphere. We were seated right away by friendly staff.  We decided to go with the lunch box and a couple of rolls. I opted for the salmon for my lunch bento. I highly recommend NOT getting the salmon with your lunch box. Apparently, \"cooking\" fish isn't their thing. It was a flimsy piece of salmon but it was the $9 lunch box so I get it. But did they have to overcook it? The edges were hard and dry, thank god for the teriyaki sauce. The tempura was tempura, the rice was rice and the California rolls were California rolls, no biggie.   What I found interesting and cost efficient was placing shredded iceberg lettuce underneath the mixed greens. Did I sign up for that? As Cher said on Clueless, it's like a Monet. From a distance it's pretty but when you get up close, it's a mess. It's not word for word but you get my point.   Then after we were finished, our soup arrived?!? Our server forgot.  I'm going to leave the review on the rolls alone. Just look at the pictures."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Been coming here a long time. Solid sushi. Not a bad price at all! Good atmosphere, and open till 4 am now"}
{"text":"I am giving one star for a reason...  I used to love this place, food quality was good and service was great.  But that all change today, and it was unbelievable what the server had told me.  The Nigiri was not fresh today, food was ok.  The service I would give 0 star if I could.  Every time we are trying to order, the server always give us this bad look.  And we don't really eat that much, trust me.  The worst part was the server lie to us in our face saying there is a limit of the Ice Cream per person...  Which is not true and I told her I have been here plenty time.  She immediate change her story saying it is not limited \"BUT I THINK EACH OF YOU HAVE 1 MOCHI ICE CREAM AND 1 REGULAR ICE CREAM I THINK THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS\"  I seriously start to laugh and tell her forget about it.  And this is my first time in my life left a $0 tips.  I thought it's AYCE!!!!  As a business owner, I feel sorry for Sushi Wa owner to have staff like that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Late night sushi was litttt. Miko gave us really good service! Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, everyone was very friendly and everything was done quickly. The waitress was very nice with constantly refilling the tea at my table; we later just asked for a pot of tea by our table. The restaurant was a little small with just under 10 tables. The food was fresh and well made. I came for dinner with a friend and we ordered 2 regular rolls and some sashimi. I thought it would not be enough, but it was made very large and not stuffed with rice (what many sushi places seem to be doing). There was some complimentary appetizers which is a plus.   I would definitely return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is incredible.  I am not a huge Sushi fan, but Sushi Wa is delicious.  I am a big fan of their chicken and rice.  The wait staff is extremely friendly and will answer any questions you have.  The atmosphere is great for hanging with friends and even birthday parties! I highly recommend Sushi Wa!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers ,sushi rolls are really good the quality of the fish is always fresh love this place that's my favorite all you can eat sushi place"}
{"text":"Great place ! My daughter loves the California roll ! I will be coming back soon ! Jenny was so fantastic and helpful."}
{"text":"Jenny was so kind and professional! Great restaurant! We had a large party and they were so accommodating!! Must go!!"}
{"text":"I went to this sushi place because it was across the parking lot from my work place. I only ordered one roll and saw that it was an AYCE place good thing i tried it first the place was terrible. I had the Tiger Roll from there, i tried alot of tiger rolls, but this had to be the worst it was so bland the only taste i got from the roll was the tuna on top that tasted like metal..... seriously if your going to charge $14 for a roll make sure it is good. Needless to say I will not be back"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.. I highly recommend the sushi boat.. It comes with tempura, seaweed salad, music soup and crunch soup, the beef teriyaki was excellent and the chef is very friendly.. They will have Ube ice-cream next week for Pinoys planning to go"}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5 star to me. Decent sushi. Decent service. Decent ambiance. Decent price. I would come back but I won't crave it.   At $21 the lunch all you can eat is a good deal. We had a bunch of different rolls which were all ok, but the ikura is crap. Don't get it."}
{"text":"A great spot for true sushi lovers. They add just the right touch of flavor to every dish. So you may as well forget there's wasabi at the table. If you love variety, this place should be on your list.  All you can eat includes sashimi, an extensive menu, desert (moochi and banana tempura, etc...). We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"They are very polite, professional, and fast service!  Love the all you can eat even on weekends!  The kids price is half the adult and works out perfect!"}
{"text":"My regular sushi joint. All you can eat includes everything on the menu, and everything is good. They have gluten free soy sauce, if you need it (ask for \"wheat free\")."}
{"text":"First time there...they have plenty of staff and the rolls and drinks keep coming...sushi and rice are fresh and bomb ski!!!! Must go...all u can eat is right price!"}
{"text":"The service is awesome, the family owned sushi shop really goes above and beyond to make your dinner experience an extra nice one!  The food is average and the place is super small. We had a group of 12 including kids, and the place is really not designed to accommodate this size of a group. The chap chae didn't quite taste like it should. The rolls were good.   It's a fine spot for a casual dinner if you're nearby, but not necessarily worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Good is mediocre at best. I ordered via uber eats. Service and delivery was fine. They made 2 rolls quickly. Wouldn't choose to come back because it was just okay."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say!! Definitely a hidden gem and well worth the find! We ordered a roll party tray and all their rolls were delicious and really fresh. Just the right amount of rice and each filling was well filled. The tempura was super crispy, crunchy and fried wonderfully. We had green tea ice cream which had corn flakes at the bottom, which was awesome!! Now the service was really wonderful!! Joseph, the sushi master, was just epic with random samples on the house for us and even came to ask us how the food was and how our night was going. Great attention to detail and keep up the good service Sushi Wa!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Sushi Wa and I am not disappointed. Great service, friendly people. $23 for all you can eat lunch and $27 all you can eat sushi for dinner  I will be coming here time and time again for the drinks and the service and the delicious sushi"}
{"text":"Not my normal AYCE place but this place is good! Nice variety of appetizers. I recommend the fire cracker, who's your daddy, heart attack, and the muscles. We had the Rose roll: baby lobster, scallop, mushroom, red onion, on a Cali roll! As for then nigiri...pepper seared baby tuna!! Love love love it! The portions are not small and the nigiri pieces are BIG!!!"}
{"text":"Heard this place from a family member that she talk so highly of. I was impressed with the decor, price is reasonable,  food was ok not great liked their ahi tuna poke a lot though. Too bad you can only have one per person if you're doing ayce. And here's the negative part why I'm only giving them 3 stars...service was mediocre at best. Server is rushing to drop plate on the table and by the time she says what the food was she's gone and they are not even busy! Our orders were wrong and our drinks were not filled for the last hour and had the balls to tell my husband he can't order drinks after we paid. Menu needs a lot of work. I don't think we'll come back."}
{"text":"The attention is this place is amazing! It's one of the main reasons for which I would come back. The sashimi was super fresh and all the sides were on point.   Price point is excellent for the area. 100% recommended."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place!  There are so many sushi places in town and they are all nice.  But the service in this restaurant is amazing and they have the food to match it.  We ordered our food and I felt like it came out in minutes!  We have attentive staff that made sure our glasses were completely full.  The sushi is extremely fresh and you can tell the chefs take their time and do things right.  I love this place, and I'm always here for my sushi fix for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is definetly one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places that I go to. 2 of my favorite things that I ordered during my last visit was the pepper seared baby tuna and the baked mussels. Last night was my first time trying the pepper tuna, but when I tried the first one it was so good, I swear I ordered two more orders, it just melts in your mouth so nicely. As for the mussels. If you are a fan of baked mussels, you need to try theirs. One of my top two places to order mussels from. Most sushi places in Vegas has them either too burnt or the cheese that they use gives an odd taste, but Sushi Wa's is perfect. Also ask for Jenny if she's working. I haven't really bothered to make any reviews about this place, but she was the best server I've had there so far. Very friendly and constantly checked up on us to see if there's anything else she can get us (we are A LOT) thanks again Jenny! :)"}
{"text":"Best around!  Sheena is a great server and didn't miss a beat!  Definitely a must have if you want quality at a fair price!"}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Wa today for lunch.  We have been to many restaurants, but this is considered one of the most memorable meals we have had.  Food: Beautifully presented with details to flavors; all the food was delicious We received 3 complimentary appetizers including - a small dish of soup noodle for each person - a beautifully presented (and tasted) mango roll - a spicy tuna roll - We ordered the following items - All lunch specials came with the salad and soup 1. Sashimi lunch - $12.95 - 12 pieces of sashimi INCLUDING - smoked flavored (that has also been marinated as explained by Joseph our Chef) tuna, halibut and milk fish - Lots of attention to detail - the red snappers have small pieces of green pepper to be eaten together - gives you new flavors - A generous portion of salad - 3 pieces of California rolls and one small serving of daily side dish - it was a freshly prepared fried spring roll 2. Tempura Lunch - $8.95 - Comes with the 3 shrimps and 5 pieces of vegetables - The rice came in a bowl that was in reasonable in portion - Tempura was very crisp and not greasy 3. Lunch special roll set - $12.95 - You get to choose 1 from 6 special rolls (that come in 8 pieces) and 1 from 6 mono rolls (that come in 6 pieces) - We got Dynamite roll and the Alaska rolls - The rolls were nicely done  Complimentary ice cream - we got to choose the flavor The portion of the ice cream is 1.5 bigger than what you will usually get.  More importantly, there are some corn flakes that they have put at the bottom of the ice cream so you get a different texture.  Such attention to detail undeniably warmed our hearts.  Service: heartfelt  How do I begin?  Joseph the sushi chef came and spoke with us a couple of times.  He made sure we are comfortable.  He offered candies to the girls.  He took out his little booklet and asked to write our names down (including our girls).  He also offered the girls to feed their fish when we are leaving.  The waitress was kind and attentive.  Joseph shared with us that he opened Sushi Wa a year ago.  We hope that he will be here for a long long time because hubby joked that we can come every Saturday for lunch now (open  7 days a week EXCEPT for Sunday lunch).  Our girls said Sushi Wa is now their favorite restaurant.  Thank you Joseph :)"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy restaurant tucked away in the corner of this center. AYCE Sushi and full menu options.  We split a bunch of AYCE menu items - loved the Avocado lover which should have been called the CRAB LOVER! Stuffed with crab and pickled jalapeños.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Henderson. Love how friendly the staff is! Ordering is quick and love that you can pick from the hot food items as well! Lunch is $21.95 and Dinner $26.95"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place!!! The sushi is not that fresh and the service is horrible. Skip it !"}
{"text":"If I could give not a single star I would because management is absolutely awful!!! Never had management be so rude to a customer in my entire life we got the all you can eat sushi and we ordered the mountain roll which was 15 dollars!! and it was disgusting!!! we asked if we could send it back after one bite and the employees INCLUDING management fought us tooth and nail because they tried to enforce their \"rules\" and charge is for the roll that we clearly only took a bite and where disgusted by it so we called over the server and the manager to came over and said we had to pay for it but then against their own rules! said we could take it home but no one wanted to eat it because it looked like a dog ate garbage puked it up ate it and puked again on the plate after fighting with them for almost 15 mins. They finally took it off but where so rude about the entire situation never been to a sushi restaurant where they won't let you give back food that was disgusting... just completely unprofessional... never ever EVER AGAIN will go there... and their chicken katsu for 11 dollars was the smallest portion I have even seen I was done with it within 5 mins... please if you like sushi and good service avoid this place at all possible..."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi gems in all of GTA!!! Prices are fair. Quality of sushi is very high. Owner/Head Chef greeted everybody and made sure everything was okay. Servers kept refilling hot tea without us asking. They even gave us free ice cream afterwards.  Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times & it's always great. Tonight the salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, & tuna were very good. We were in a group & the wait staff was always very attentive to us. We'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a decent price (not too pricy). Would definitely return. We ordered the yaki udon, which was good and not too oily, as well as the King roll and Eskimo roll. I like how they have 'mini' sizes of the rolls, so you can order a larger variety to try!  We also got a free tiny sushi roll to try- they said it is a new addition to their menu (when I say tiny, I mean TINY- like the size of a toonie). It had spicy mayo sauce on it, and wow was it spicy! The biggest disappointment was that we didn't get ice cream at the end of the meal!!!!! :("}
{"text":"4 or 4.5.  I went here with my SO when he was visiting because we already went to Osaka that week and wanted to try a new place.  The fish is super fresh. They have the normal rolls, but their special rolls are amazing!  The decor is great, definitely chic. You don't feel out of place in jeans and a T, though. We went here late afternoon. The LSU game was on (SO went to LSU) and it's a nice place to watch sports. It was interesting...all of the sushi chefs were into the game, but normally at other places that means the rolls take forever to get finished and are low quality. All I can say is...great multitaskers! The rolls were awesome, the fish was top quality, it wasn't busy, very attentive staff.  Try something new and order a roll that sounds intriguing. At some sushi places I am not happy when I do this, but everything here is described well and they tell you exactly what to expect. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is ridonkulous.  I don't use the word \"ridonkulous\" often but this place deserves it! AYCE is phenomenal. Wa Salad is some incredible sashimi salad concoction that deserves it's own platform to perform on.  Kid friendly yet posh looking on the inside. Standing ovation.  I will be back.  Maybe even tomorrow.  Moved down to 4 stars from 5.  This last trip back, the food was still good bit service not so much."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had in Toronto. The owner, Joseph, is very friendly and greets customers every time, while making an effort to remember names. They also give you lots of samples on the house. Overall, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa has officially become my favorite sushi place in Vegas.. even if it is on the complete opposite side of town for me.  The sushi bar is stupid busy, and they get food out fast.  My friend decided we were doing AYCA sushi for me, lol, and I usually worry about these decisions because I usually don't down a lot of sushi in one sitting.  Buuut, this AYCA includes sashimi,  and appetizers, and dessert.  There was LA kalbi on the menu, and I get it's portioned small because it's an app and it promotes variety, but damn they were good.  They were done so right, and this was my friend's first opportunity try some Korean BBQ. Yeah, this is another sushi place run by Koreans, and it's good.  She got their garlic edamame and I got the spicy one, it's actually spicy.  I liked it more than I usually like edamame.    We got the rose roll, and it had lobster and baked scallops and sauce and sweet  onion and was really tasty, her favorite is the ultimate garlic tuna roll, it's on a plate surrounded by garlic sauce.  We got salmon sashimi, and this other roll with white tuna on top and I forgot what it was called, and bunch of other stuff I can't remember the names of, I can't remember the menu, but just eat it.  We got coffee and green tea mochi ice cream, it was a nice little end."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, and they have not only excellent food but excellent service. They have ayce of course, which makes this place worth while. The rolls are great, the fish is very fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! Read all the reviews and had to come and check it out. Won't repeat all the great stuff about Joseph as it was all true from the little book to walking you outside. We got 2 of the bentos and the portions were great and the sushi was very fresh. We got back from Japan a month ago and it was nice because it was like the super friendly service all over again and good sushi for not being in Japan. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with the AYCE! Price, and selection is amazing compared to most sushi places. Lovely decor, nice service as well. I ordered a baked roll, attempted to eat it, but my stomach wasnt having it! They gladly took it back and did not charge me for the roll.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in the area. Their lunch Bento is nicely portioned and the price is fair as well for the quality of food they are serving. The feel of the restaurant is nice and cozy and their staff is friendly and helpful especially their chef who tries to come around and see how everyone is doing."}
{"text":"The AYCE option let's you try everything, which hubby and I love. We hadn't been here in a while but we're glad we came, for the most part. The tuna poki salad was good, we loved the Mango Salmon Roll, Double D, and Baked Salmon Roll. Hubby ordered the Albacore Salad and it was huge, so unfortunately he got full on that pretty quick.  The disappointments were the Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll, which surprisingly lacked flavor, and the Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream, which wasn't very crunchy at all. Also got a very oily sweet potato tempura, which we didn't eat. And one shrimp tempura with the Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura left me wanting more shrimp. They should offer half roll options too, not just for the last roll."}
{"text":"Great place to eat... A small restaurant with big service and great food. Try the spicy tuna... Try something new I am sure will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We love Sushi Wa! This spot has become a regular for me and my husband. To the reviews that state that they don't get enough fish and too much rice - I have never experienced that. All the times I ordered sashimi, I receive a huge slab of fish. All their rolls are great and I've never had bad service in all the times we've gone. Love their Superman Burrito!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa used to be the best AYCE in its zip code, but I hadn't been there in a few years due to its major drop in quality.   For my niece's graduation dinner, we went there, and the beef appetizers got me sick. I had to run to the bathroom.  Also, none of the fish seemed fresh or even close to it.  I'm not going back, and apparently many others have had the same experience because the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Have to visit this establishment every time I visit Las Vegas. Always sit at the bar and talk to the chef as they prepare our orders. I like the AYCE so a variety of foods can be sampled. The food is great. I can't wait until I visit again next year!"}
{"text":"Sushi wa is always our go to when we want sushi! The service is amazing !! And the AYCE IS SO WORTH IT ! We only come here when we're craving sushi."}
{"text":"Love going to try new places , but usually you stick to what you know with sushi.  Glad i give the place a try!  The restaurant it self was extremely trendy, food was exceptional and service was as well.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying sushi. The reviews seemed pretty good and my friend wanted to go back because she has enjoyed it in the past.  Only one other table of diners, we were seated quickly. We had some questions about the menu and the all you can eat option.  Friend ordered some sashimi while we decided.  Decided to go for the all you can eat $26.95.  We were told she couldn't because the sashimi she ordered wasn't part of the deal.  Expressed my frustration because we TOLD him we were thinking of that option.  The manager gave her approval though we had to pay $9 for the appetizer.  Things were going well. The food was quite slow coming out of the kitchen and we were not getting plates at the same time.  It was throwing off the tempo of the meal.   We were talking and then the waiter decides to tell us that we will be charged for any food left on the plate.   We did NOT over order. It was that he brought 2 plates out at the same time.  Then after we expressed our irritation with him. The manager came over again and said, \"I see you are really trying.\"  Gee thanks, so you won't charge me MORE money.  Left there spending $80.00.   Don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a terrific dinner last night, AYCE.  The full menu was virtually available and the sushi was excellent!  The Rose Roll was unbelievable!  We had made I Love Sushi our regular stomping ground, but now SushiWa is on top of our list."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for the all you can eat sushi and I'm a fan. I recommend going in a group and all getting AYCE so that you can share and try more things without getting full on a single item. It is good quality, made to order sushi. They limit very few items, like you can only get one order sea urchin and of sashimi per person. I loved the Screaming Orgasm and the Pepper Seared Tuna sashimi, definitely getting those again. Appetizers are also included in the AYCE deal ($26 at dinner) which was a pleasant surprise - almost everything on the menu is unlimited. But leave room for desert because the AYCE also includes your choice of ice cream, mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream and banana tempura. I was stuffed but I couldn't resist tempura green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Took my dad and 2 brother here for dinner to celebrate my dad's belated birthday..  THE FOOD: 4/5 First and most importantly...the food was really good. Albeit desserts, the banana tempura and coffee Mochi were amazing and is one of the main components that would favor the odds in me going again. The diverse variety of interesting  Rolls and side dishes is what I liked most about this establishment. Some definitely better than others, but it all ultimately comes down to personal preference.   SUSHI CHEF/SERVICE: 1/5 Now the service was on the other hand was very disappointing and unwelcoming. When being seated, we asked to sit at the bar to where we could have a view of the tv. (which had my dads favorite team playing that night for Thursday night football) We asked to seat near the middle of the bar and was told they were closing this section down for the night. I asked if they were reserved but was told that section of the bar was not going to be available for customers and would not be seating anyone on that side for the night. So, we were sat in the left corner of the bar near the restrooms where there is little to no view of the tv, which isn't a huge deal to be honest because we were all talking/enjoying each other's company, & if we wanted to eat somewhere to watch sports we'd of gone to Buffalo Wild Wings or something lol. Really not an issue, but definitely a bit annoying considering the fact that within the next 5-10 minutes, as new customers arrived, they were greeted more welcoming and provided more favorable service with no restrictions when asking to sit at the bar, \"Yes, of course, please sit anywhere you'd like.\"Couple that with the fact that every time we'd order anything, our chef was lacking professionalism and displayed bad manners/service. He kept insisting on making it a point that if we didn't finish the food they'd charge us extra. Which is understandable to let your customers know this, especially considering we did order a lot of food, but when your out trying to celebrate a birthday it definitely gives off bad vibes when your chef keeps reminding you of this rule every 3 seconds. Definitely lost major points with us given the fact that with each additional order his body language and tone continued to become noticeably more and more negative/pissy. Several times while he came over to collect new requests, he would hear the first one and while myself or someone in my party would begin to make a new request for other items he would ignore, cut off or immediately walk away while we were speaking to ignore additional requests. Needless to say we did finish everything we ate. But the service from being seated to dealing with the pissy-attitude chef was very underwhelming to say the least.  WAITING STAFF: 4/5 The waitresses/waiters who were running out drinks and side dishes however were extremely polite and professional and were very prompt and attentive to our needs. Outside of the seating situation we had initially had upon arriving, they were exceptional. The servers, specifically the middle aged Asian women who was working that night, were the only reason we decided to tip 20% and are the main reason we did not leave the place with a a bad taste in our mouths from the shortcomings of the chef.    Overall 3/5. Food was good. Service needs to get better. Sucks because all it takes is one person to ruin it for everyone. However in this case that \"one person\" happens to play a very important part in your restaurant. Hope for the future customers that they do not experience this as this NEEDS to be corrected. That chef is NOT an accurate representation of how the overall staff was. I do not over react like others who when experiencing bad service will immediately bash and do the most to make an establishment look bad. Not a horrible/unbearable experience by any means, the food was good and dishes were more creative than your typical sushi bar, but when there is so much competition here in Vegas, places like this simply cannot afford to underwhelm in the service department.   Food for thought."}
{"text":"I'm a little upset about my visit tonight at Sushi Wa. My family and I go there just about any chance we get, but due to changing schedules, new jobs, etc. it has been about a month since we came in last.   We were seated quickly, in a booth that we requested- there were a couple at a table, a few people at the bar, and one other booth occupied when we arrived.   We noticed right off hand that the menus were new. Which made us wonder if the management or owner had changed- because it was a completely different style.   The waitress, who didn't introduce herself wasn't one that we had ever seen before. She brought back our drinks rather quickly, and took my boyfriends order, but as soon as I opened my mouth to ask for my rolls-she walked away. And she didn't come back until she delivered our first order of food.   When I did ask to order, her face completely changed. It was shocking to me.  At first I thought it was just me, but my boyfriend saw it as well. It looked as if I was severely an inconvenience to her, and as if she had somewhere to be.   I know that menu items take time, however, with a restaurant that isn't even 1/4 full, waiting 30 minutes for two rolls that were ordered by my boyfriend the first time is a little silly.   The food was still delicious, I recommend the sex bomb, bonsai, crispy rice, and the seared peppered baby tuna. However, it's the worst service that we have ever experienced-and I'm disappointed in sushi wa. Hopefully this was just a fluke."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 2 years now, and always recommended this place to friends. However, was recently here and the waiting staff was so rude with derogatory comments. I will no longer eat here due to the rude waiting staff and will no longer recommend to others. I highly recommend the owners of this establishment get nicer waiting staff."}
{"text":"My family and I came for dinner . Just love this place! So fresh and delicious! If you like Sushi this is your place to eat at. The soups are so yummy! You must try the tempura  ice cream... omg !!"}
{"text":"-Complimentary Apps (Korean Noodle Soup, Fried Tuna Roll, Mango Roll) -Lunch Bento is a pretty good deal -Volcano roll is one of the best I have ever had in my life but a little pricey at $14.95 -Presentation is always on point and so creative -Owner gave us free ice cream with corn flakes at the end of our meal -Waitresses are extremely attentive  Which restaurant do you go to now a days where the owner gives you complimentary item(s), asks for a personal review, writes your name down, shakes your hand, has good quality food on the regular then; personally walks you to your car and waves to you as you leave?!? Joseph is amazing; his good food and exceptional customer service is what is getting him good reviews and loyal customers. This place is in a plaza and is fairy small but comes with a great experience. I enjoy being here because I feel like the owner actually cares and its realy relaxing as opposed to being at other sushi places where I'm constantly on the look out to flag my waitress down for water.  Don't come here if you expecting an upscale sushi place with expensive decor and unique items, its a little family run spot with good customer service and good food"}
{"text":"I would say Sushi Wa is the best place to go if you want to have an exquisite experience of Japanese cusine. They served us on the house small korean noodles (thin noodles as far as I remember), and it was so good. It was just the complimentary food on the house! The sushi, it was the best. It's 30 dollars for the small size sushi platter, but there's already a lot of sushi pieces in it and they are so generous with the fillings! The food was out of this world. They even greeted my mom by playing happy birthday and sticked a candle on our on the house ice cream! (Since it's our first time going here). May God bless this place and everyone else!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the nigiris had TOO MUCH RICE. Our server didn't even check on us unless I waved her down."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here tonight. We don't get many times off and we we very much looking forward to it. We have been here before and always had an enjoyable time. But tonight I see why people will stop going to spots due to one night of unenjoyable experiences. We started with poki salad which was chewy. Had to track down the server that was assigned to tables and not the bar to get drinks And such. The staff behind the bar was silent and cold, didn't hear a word until good night when we got up to leave. Like I said we have enjoyed this spot many times but I will think of other options next time we get a minute with out the kids to ensure a great experience."}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch hour with coworkers. As a sushi newbie, this is only my 2nd time eating in a sushi restaurant . The atmosphere was nice, but the service was slow. Very slow. If  you got all the time in the world come on in. If the clock is ticking, pace yourself!  I had the cooked sushi and tempura, very yummy though."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Definitely coming back. Friendly staff and very unique taste to the food. A lot of care was put into the food that was prepared. Loved it here!"}
{"text":"So I live right down the street and been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it. Came in for lunch and the price is reasonable. The environment is nice and appealing.... But the big swordfish hanging alone... Doesn't make sense in the decor. Anyways, the food is good. Fish is fresh and cut in good portions. The waitress I had was friendly and to the point. For the amount of people here for lunch on a Tuesday I did expect food to arrive a little faster. But considering I wasn't in a hurry I didn't mind at all. Now my review of the food is based on nigiri because I do not like rolls. I'm not a sushi elitist by any means, I just like to taste the natural fish with little to no flare. To that aspect, the food was amazing. All the fish that I had was very fresh and minimalistic. Definitely will be coming back for dinner, might even bring the wife."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 31, they were almost prepared with seating for 26, so we scrambled to find other chairs to seat our entire party.  We signed up for the all you can eat for all the adults and Alan carte for the. Kids.  The appetizers are good, spicy edamame, but the agadashi tofu was not good.  The sushi was good and their rolls are a good combo.  Their uni sushi did not seem right, and it was a bit greyish, I could eat the second one, oh and was told if I didn't finish it,i I would be charged extra...needless to say, I hid it in the napkin and tossed it under the table. Hubby said the short ribs, korean, was delish, the kids loved the udon noodles, the hamachi Kama was bony but good, calamari yummy.  They have a huge variety of dishes, sides, sushi and appetizers!  You will be sure to find something g delish to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great quality, good service, what else does one look for in a sushi place? Also, lots of parking space! However, not too many seats are available so be aware of that. Also, try to stick to the lunch/dinner specials, they really over charge for an extra miso soup or an extra garden salad."}
{"text":"I 100% agree with Alex N. It wasn't that the fish was bad it was more like the whole thing felt like the McDonald's of a \"chic sushi restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Great sushi, nice staff.  Good prices."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is our favorite place for all you can eat sushi. The food is great. The location is right by our house. And the people are very nice."}
{"text":"TL;DR Very price friendly menu that offers quality for more than it's worth. You won't get full but if you order two lunch specials or a special + maki then you have your money's worth for a very satisfied stomach. The a la carte does NOT disappoint.  Came here because I've read all the tales about how the owner would greet you but unfortunately he didn't greet us today. Bummer. Also no toro, double bummer.  Went in about lunch time and the service was quite slow. Not because the server was lazy, there was only one. So if all the tables (listen there's only like 5) get filled up you can imagine how the service is gunna be when someone's trying to make everyone happy. I applaud this because the server was very nice and courteous.  The sushi here is quite above average I might say. It's not fishy for sure but I question the freshness for specific fish like how dry looking they were instead of the expected oiliness of fresh fish.   Ordering from a la carte was different. Maybe it was because I got fish that weren't necessarily similar to salmon and tuna. If you'd like your fish untorched or torched please let them know, they are very accomadating which is lovely in today's modern society of \"I want my food like this\" when sushi really is and should be up to how the chef serves it.  A la carte Mackerel Nigiri x2: 1 raw & 1 torched (4/5) I loved the raw mackerel but In my opinion, I didn't like the torched. I knocked off a star even though it was my choice to have one torched LOL.  A la carte Scallop (Hotate) x4 Raw (10/7) OMG WAS THIS SO GOOD. i was so sad to hear they didn't have any tuna belly in so I opted for this because I liked it so much that I ordered another two. Not fishy at all and the sweetness is a great pairing to the rice.  Lunch Special Beef Bento (3/5) Not filling, very pretty, side dishes were all lovely, but imo was sososo bland in a sense that the beef almost tasted like water LOL idk how or why I didn't like it but my dad said it was 'good enough' especially for how cheap it was. Ended up ordering another bowl of rice too.  Lunch Special Sushi & Sashimi (4/5) Cheap, better than average, beautiful, but the sashimi chunks were way too big for me. Very very generous but I don't personally enjoy eating half a piece of sashimi because it was cut too big or eating a whole chunk in my mouth. The sashimi was cut almost like chunks for a poke except it doesn't come with rice lol.  Overall a very beautiful restaurant with instagram worthy art and adorable service. The fish served is definafely better than most places I've been too and would definately drop by if I was in the area again for a budget friendly lunch. Thank you for having me!"}
{"text":"After reading all the raving reviews here and seeing that it was in our new neighborhood, we gave this place a try. Why oh why oh why?! Let's start with the positive. The contemporary interior was a pleasant surprise considering the banal exterior facade.   Now for what really matters, service and sushi. Much MUCH! to be desired.   1) The temakis served were overfilled with unseasoned, mushy WARM rice. Nigiri rice appeared about 2 inches x 1 x 1.  Required two bites or a disgusting crammed-mouthful. Length of fish was not slightly longer than rice and sliced too thin.  TWO stars off.   Sushi rice properly cooked and seasoned and freshness/quality of toppings are key to the success of a sushi establishment for more discerning patrons. Fish quality here was fine considering you're in the middle of a desert.   2) twice reminded server that I had not been served my uni nigiri yet. Never got it although we were seated as dinner AYCE diners. ONE star off.   3) took 20 minutes for server to return to take second order. I'm a very patient person--still tipped 20%. Perhaps understaffed for the night? Not server's fault.   4) didn't appreciate being reminded to finish rice. See #1  5) 7:15 pm and they were out of hamachi kama. Perhaps they were slammed earlier. No star off for that."}
{"text":"The other night I came here for dinner and had a really good experience. The employees were really nice and the food was fresh. I ordered an avocado salmon roll (I know it sounds kind of boring) and two pieces of seared butterfish nigiri. However, I do have an excuse. I'm both gluten and lactose free so my options are limited to pretty plain items.   With that being said, my salmon avocado roll was better than most. It melted in my mouth and tasted fantastic! I'm not sure what their secret is but I'll definitely have to go back.   The seared torched butterfish was out of this world! It tasted amazing!  I've had seared sashimi at sushi restaurants before with some disappointment but the waiter recommended I order this and it was unreal. I actually didn't realize it was seared until after I placed my order. The waiter, who was really friendly insisted I would love it. Since I was starving I didn't bother changing my order and am so happy I discovered their seared butterfish. I don't really know how to describe it besides the fact that it was scrumptious, extremely flavourful and tender.   Allover I had a great experience at this restaurant and will definitely go back to dine in or order takeout."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Best place so far to get great sushi. Very nice and clean restaurant! The staff is very friendly, we will definitely be back! I recommend the Rose Roll, superman burrito."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get sushi. The fish is fresh and the sushi is amazing. The customer service is amazing and the owner will make sure you have a great meal. The only downside is that the place is hard to find and small. Though very nice. Will definetly come again."}
{"text":"Got the recommendations from my sister in law and she said everything was so good there... had to check it out so me and my fiance walked in and it was empty but the decorations were very modern lounge kind of feel.  The one manager was awesome giving us recommendations on which roll is good... and the waitor was super nice and funny... for AYCE they give you sashimi per person. I got the crunch albacore because I was already hooked on their calamari with the honey dipping and he got the screaming orgasm which I wish I order another one because it was so good!!.. the appetizers were amazing too... their mussels were cheesy and pretty big mussels compared to some places.  overall my experience there was amazing... chill ... friendly ... I definitely will come back...."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls. fresh ingredients with thin rice, big chunks of avocado, really tasty.  Great service! The owner asked for our names and offered free ice cream. Imagine that he greeted all other customers and remembered their names, it is now hard to find someone who runs store like this.  Will definitely revisit when get a chance."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places at Henderson ! With very good price for all u can eat! Loved the baja dish !"}
{"text":"My Barber Shop is next door so we have decided to go to sushi wa on occasion. i usually never write reviews and often discredit \"yelpers\" for being super stupid with complaints like the price etc. The reason for my 1 star is a culmination of several things that made me uncomfortable and ultimately moved me to write this.  #1 - got the impression that they were really busy so i definitely expected things to move a little slowly.. that wasn't the problem, the problem was the Sushi Chef getting Visibly and Verbally upset over incoming orders, and our order.. we were the only diners at the bar and he actually was getting mad at us for ordering (he was busy fulfilling the seated guests orders)  #2 Not Once offered Wasabi or Ginger.. and we were honestly so weirded out by the Chefs attitude we were a little scared it would be awkward asking for it...   Go somewhere better, or definitely don't go for lunch on a Sunday. I would love for them to respond and explain"}
{"text":"My dad loves this place and always makes sure to bring me here when I come to town to visit. And I can see why: The variety and quality of the sushi available is top of the line, and the staff/cooks are friendly and informative. Whether you go AYCE or a la carte, it's worth paying too much to spend an evening sampling every kind of roll you can think of and stuffing yourself sick on the wide variety of sushi here. It's expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Even though this place is quite far from where we live, I love to come here because the sushi is so amazing. Our server Shenna is very attentive and personable. She was so good and we had a large party. I would definitely recommend this place to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Our favorite! !! We get our fix here weekly,  I highly recommend the peppered tuna!  Food, atmosphere and service deserve 5 stars!! Gio the manager and Mark the server Rock!"}
{"text":"This place is just okay in my opinion. A friend's birthday promoted my 2nd and probably last visit here. I had been here one other time, and thought it was just okay, but I like to give a place the benefit of the doubt before I decide whether or not it is worth coming back. The second visit confirmed I will probably not be back.  There were 6 of us and the service started out good. We were given waters and menus and after a short while we ordered at least a dozen rolls and appetizers between the table. I was surprised at how quickly the first round of food came out. The rolls were just okay, some better than others for sure. My favorites were the Superman Burrito and the Japanese Lasagna. One thing I don't like is they are very heavy handed with the sauces. They are not very flavorful and don't complement the rolls as a sauce should. I like to taste the fish and not have it covered up with sauce. I also don't like the batter that they use for their deep-fried rolls, but that is no fault of theirs, that is just my personal preference.   Anyway after the first round we didn't see our server for a looooong time. We asked whoever we could flag down to get him to come to our table, but he was no where to be found. He finally emerged and we ordered more food. He was a nice guy, I just wish he came around more often. I enjoyed dessert the best. I got the banana tempura which comes with 6 pieces of fried banana, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. That was deeeelicous. They also have tempura ice cream, regular ice cream and mochi. Bonus points for having coffee flavored mochi :) I probably wouldn't come back here. It's on the other side of town from me, and I just don't particularly care for many of their items."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this restaurant today and we were very impressed. We got the AYCE and I was actually surprised how delicious the food was. We also really enjoyed the service. The staff was very attentive and pleasant. I also loved the decor, very stylish. We had an enjoyable experience and will most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A small place with excellent food. Don't judge it from the outside! What you had will be definitely worthy of what you paid! You can get free treat sometimes which is an extra benefit in here."}
{"text":"Sushiwa has amazing customer service. Jenny was amazing at making sure everyone got what they needed. She's amazing and the food is amazing. The variety of food on the all you can eat menu is among the best I've had. Also, try the white peach blossom cocktail, it's godlike."}
{"text":"Sushiwa is my favorite sushi place ever! The 911 rolls are to die to for! I come here all the the time with my friends for the all you can eat sushi! So good!"}
{"text":"Great food and really good service.  The owner was really nice and welcoming. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas.  I love sushi and typically eat there once or twice a month, and have been doing so for the last 4 years.  I have always been a sushi lover, but always struggled to stay with one restaurant in Las Vegas due to occasional bad fish.  Sushi Wa has never let me down.  I have never left there with a bad taste in my mouth.  Their sushi is always super fresh!  And, I love some of their specialty rolls.  In my opinion, they are the best all you can eat sushi place in Vegas!  Additionally, their staff and new manager are top notch!"}
{"text":"Went on Friday night for dinner and the place was busy; didnt have to wait in line because we went slightly earlier before dinner peak time. Staffs were friendly and accomodating. Sushi was excellent (balance rice and fish ratio) and the thought of putting bit and pieces of onion and/or afalfa sprouts in some pieces of the sushi left a good impression on us. We also had a torched salmon roll which was also really good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here today with my mother. We came pretty hungry, and we wanted to try somewhere new.  The decor is super beautiful. Almost too nice for an ayce place. The waitresses are very nice and are always refilling your water and tea. The male waiter was pretty good looking lol. And very prompt. The food came out fast. They don't do half rolls, which is a bummer.  First things first. We got a miso soup, two cucumber salads, agedashi tofu, and two rounds of nigiri to start. The miso soup was huge and delish. The tofu was GINORMOUS and sweeter than any agedashi tofu I've ever had. Nonetheless, still tasty. The ikura was good. The salmon and yellowtail was also very thick, minimal rice, and fresh. The baby seared tuna was AMAZEEEE. The cucumber salad, I would avoid. Pretty tasteless.  We got a rose roll, which was again, huge. But okay. Lots of baby lobster and scallops. The superman roll was the hit. We loooove spicy garlic ponzu. It was delish! The pockey roll, or avocado lover was odd. Not what I was expecting at all. The jalapeños inside were pickled? Which I found odd. Fresh minced or deep fried would have made it better for sure. The bikini roll was also pretty yummy, this was a riceless roll.  All in all, a pretty good place to go. Definitely coming back for that superman burrito roll and try some more stuff."}
{"text":"If you want to know what it feels like to be treated like a princess/prince (whatever floats your boat), this is the place to go!! I have not once felt as valued as a customer as I did here. They REALLY set the bar for high quality customer service. From the moment we stepped in to our last few steps out the door, Joseph (owner) and his employees provided us with the best service anyone could ask for!   Now please take a seat as I begin to narrate to you a tale from my book of WAIT WHAT, IS THIS RESTAURANT FOR REAL?! (because it was that unbelievably awesome).  It all started like this - as we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Joseph. He brought us to our sofa booth and FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, he actually pulled aside the table so that I could sit in with ease. Instead of having to shuffle in like I usually do, he very politely gestured for me to sit, before doing the same on the alternate side for my boyfriend to sit. You should've seen the look on my face.. I was so pleasantly surprised. Then, as we were going through the menu together, the employee caught on that we were first-timers so she asked if we wanted a picture book that depicted EVERY ITEM on the menu. That was a pretty awesome and useful compilation. After we ordered, we were brought our complimentary appetizers and we were given two extra dishes on the house! The first was a deep fried maki roll, and the other was a rice paper mango, beet, and avocado roll! Both were very interesting and beautifully presented.  We had ordered a small sushi and roll boat and beef bugolgi. The boat was awesome - again, beautifully presented, and the variety of sushi was both fresh and innovative! Some of them had been slightly torched and garnished with herbs or scallions, which really added to the aesthetics of the boat and the flavours of the sushi. The bugolgi was great too, but nothing too special that I would have to point out.  As we slowly ate away at our ambitious order, Joseph came to our table to greet us and introduce himself. He shook our hands and asked if we could write our names down in his little notebook so he could remember us by name?! What an amazingly sweet gesture. We talked for a bit before he let us resume our date. While we were just about to finish up, Joseph came to our table yet again and this time, he offered us ice cream on the house?! At that point, I was actually so overwhelmed by his generosity and kindness. I thought it would've been a small scoop to share between the two of us but NOPE, he brought out two full sized portions, one mango and the other ginger. The mango was great BUT THE GINGER DOEEE - it was delicious. It had pieces of candied ginger in it and both ice creams were supported by a base of corn flakes. It was honestly the perfect combination. A nice sweet and light crunch to the creamy and smooth ice cream.  Finally, as we were leaving the restaurant, Joseph walked us out to the door, and shook our hands one last time before wishing us well on our way.  LIKE WHAT?! Did you fully absorb all of that yet? Isn't it slightly hard to believe that there's still this quality of service in a regular restaurant in this day and age?!  Well, there is, and it's right here. SO YEP, 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"OK, this is--THE NEW SPOT!!!-- Really 4.75 stars!!!   They have lunch a specials-1/2 off menu for sushi... Mon-Sat. before 3pm.  The Mexican Roll is a new favorite of myself and the husband!!!! It comes on wantons, no rice... its spicy tuna, onion, mango, jalapeños and im sure a few other things! Its absolutely AMAZING!!! I didnt think i would like it, that was until i saw someone else order it asked what it was and then tried it... OMG, thats all i can say! The Superman Roll is just amazing also!!! (our favorite by far and we save it for last)   They have great Nigiri as well!!!! The Salmon literally melts in your mouth, the garlic tuna is wonderful, the super white tuna, great!!! They have very high quality fresh fish! I just cant say enough good about this place!!!  And and and... If you go there enough you get your very own set of special chopsticks with your name on them that you get to store there, pick up when you come in, use and they wash and keep them there for you for next time your in!! We got ours today!!!!!!! :) I cant wait to go back and use them! Next time i am going to try the Salmon-Bomb!! Which i noticed once i was too full this time! Husband said we could come on sat or mon next week to have lunch and try it!!!! So now Im really looking forward to going back next week for lunch!!!!!!!!!!   We ate a LOT, and i mean a LOT of stuff... like 6 orders of Nigiri and 2 orders of Mexican Roll, a Superman Roll (not on special, so it was $15) and like 3 other rolls as well........ $65 total/tax incl. Not bad at all!  SushiWa, I thank you for coming into my life just when i needed you..... I was just saying to the husband today when we were leaving that we would have to bring Brian (from the Ka) with us to SushiWa so we could see him and hang out and not have to go to the \"awful Ka\" ...... just a thought?!??"}
{"text":"Went here last month been meaning to write about the excellent quality of there fish. Sat at the bar and JJ was our cook, we did the all you can eat. Great service and food. JJ even made us a little something special after we were full. Thanks for great service and food."}
{"text":"I have been to many AYCE sushi places and I must say this one was awesome, not just for the food but for the whole experience. Our waitress was very attentive, as were the other two men that were on staff. Some AYCE sushi places I have been to that have a time limit will let you order a few items and then just ignore you for a while to let the time pass before they can kick you out. This was not the case, they constantly checked on us and even when we were waiting for food we had ordered, they asked if we saw anything else we would like to order. They had great suggestions too. We had a few rolls, the superman burrito is a must try and the gyoza's were great. They had a large choice of cocktails and sake as well! Thanks for the great experience Sushi Wa staff, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to for AYCE on this side of town. The late hours are great.  I had the bento box.  At 1am it was a good mix of items and really hit the spot.  The mango salmon roll was surprisingly refreshing and crisp quality.  Thank you Miko for always taking of us!  Excellent service.  Asks before I even realize I need something.  I love that!"}
{"text":"It would've been 3.5 stars but I do like this place so I round up. Not the best place I've been, but the food is pretty good. Pricing for AYCE is like anywhere else, but they do offer sashimi with AYCE, but limited to one order per person. And the Pepper Seared Tuna, yum!! And the yellowtail.... mmmm  The service, though, definitely lacking. The 2 times I have been there has been on quite nights, with only 3-4 other tables, but yet still takes forever to greet the table. Okay okay, so we usually have 8-12 people and we order a lot, but we make it easy for the servers cause I do all the ordering and I keep it organized. But she had troubles getting all the orders, and some of the orders never made it out, and some got confused, etc.   But they got uni, amaebi, raw oysters, soft shell crabs (very small orders, but no limit), and the superman roll was good too. I usually don't go for many rolls cause they fill me too quick, but they are good! And handrolls... at first they were amazing, but after the first order, we ordered 6 more hand rolls and they went cheap on the fish!  Still, a good place to dine, if you have the time. Good and simple decor, TV at the bar for sports, and fresh quality fish. I recommend this place to lots of friends and family. Had the commute not been so bad, I'd be here every week. Well, maybe in the winter when I don't have to watch my weight."}
{"text":"Found this place on my trusty Yelp app and the Reviews did not lie! Why do I even doubt Yelp still? Anyways this Sushi place is delicious, cheap, and super friendly! We ordered the Small Sashimi and Sushi combo with Kalbi ribs. We also had the green tea ice cream. The fish was fresh and kalbi was juicy and yummy.   The prices are pretty decent and not uber expensive like some other Sushi places I normally frequent. At the end of our meal, Chef/Owner Joseph came to our table himself and asked how our meal was. We were honest as usual and told him that we could definitely taste all of the love and heart he puts into his food.   Come here for Sushi if you are in the area...or even if you are not.. make the trip because this place is that good!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Decided to try it out since it had a pretty high review and it definitely didn't disappoint. The presentation was nice and the service was amazing. Joesph personally came out and asked us how our meal was, took down our names and offered us ice cream since it was our first time there. On our way out the door he came out with us and gave us a lollipop each. The owner definitely made it a memorable first experience. I would 100% recommend this place to sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Great place and sweet servers ! Food is also great! I recommend the screaming O! Free beer with a yelp review too! :)"}
{"text":"Really great sushi had an awesome time with my boyfriend they have these booths that are really tall and romantic!! Plus all you can eat sushi, and if u can eat sushi i strongly suggest u do because it adds up nicely! Also, they are open till 4a so definitely a new late night spot on my list!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth your while. This small restaurant features some best sushi rolls I ever had. And Joseph, the owner, rocks. He greeted me and my parents personally. No wonder this is one of the few that gets a five star rating."}
{"text":"Good sushi, great staff, and very kind staff. Our server was kind and smart, we went there for a late dinner on mothers day. the owner (Joseph) came to our table offered a rose for all ladies. He made effort to learn our difficult Iranian names, then he greeted us in Persian, it was a lovely gesture or at least memorable. Also he took our orders for complementary ice cream."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner and that's exactly what it was. We were seated within seconds of walking in the door. The server took our drink order as soon as we walked in the door. Great service fresh fish. Good food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"If you don't live in the area (Henderson) or nearby you'd never know this place is there. It's hidden in a strip mall, which, I know is such a shock for Vegas (not!), next to the social security office. My husband and I discovered it one day after they first opened and went back several times.   The fish is very fresh and the rolls are very very tasty. If you sit at the counter the chef will prepare a special dish for you; we had something called Screaming Orgasm, and well, it speaks for itself. If you live in the area or have a local who can point the way for you, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant  and close to my office.  Services  is great  and the food  is delicious.  Great for large party, business  meetings  or take your sweetheart"}
{"text":"This Korean run place is a step above your typical sushi joint. For one, their sashimi is more fresh. And they put more care into crafting the sushi than other places. Decent price to quality ratio.  We ordered one of the boat set and were very satisfied. There is a good mix of fish in there. Service is a notch above your average place. Yes I was greeted by the owner who is a very energetic guy!  The best a la carte place in my opinion is still Marado which is also Korean run. But this is the next best thing for fresh sea food in the area. The space is quite small though. If you have a large group, might want to call in advance."}
{"text":"I actually didn't know what to expect as it is tucked into a plaza. We got the sushi and sashimi dinner for takeout. The presentation was adorable, they had radish, jalapenos and pea sprouts which actually really added flavour to the sushi. The fish was definitely very fresh and the rice had that perfect texture at the right temperature. Though the only thing I would say is that for approximately $20 for the set (which comes with miso soup and a salad), it's not necessarily the most filling thing. But I would definitely come back for lunch (as they do have good deals) and also try the rolls as well."}
{"text":"The service is always great, and the sushi is always fresh.  The ayce is great and you should try the fresh wasabi!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa Located in Henderson , a nicely decorated all you can eat sushi and Japanese restaurant offering a variety of sushi and Japanese inspired entrees and appetizers. This place is Yelp friendly as I noticed they suggest you ask how to get a free drink or app from the server.  My only confusion was that they wanted my to write the review before I obtained my free drink right there on the spot which didn't make sense to me as I don't review a place for he most part until after a few times even. So I mentioned I'd show them my review next time I come in !  I tried a variety of nigiri, sashimi, hot appetizers and they were all good. I generally don't go to all you can eat sushi spots but this one hit the spot ! Their service was more than exceptional.  I think next time I go i will try the Ramen!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good but service is so slow, rude and disorganized it makes it impossible to recommend this place.  Too many other sushi places that treat their customers far better."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot!  Beautiful decor, great music, and the best sushi I've had in a long time.  Best of all-amazing service.  We were so impressed and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Man, this place was so much fun to eat at.  As we all know, I tend to dine solo.  If I'm hungry, I'm gonna go eat.  I can make friends where ever I'm at.  Cue scene: Saturday night 10pm.  I'm starved... After my disastrous breakfast, I realized I hadn't eaten since then. So I check out my trust Yelp for something close yet tasty.  Enter SushiWa and their AYCE.  I think what hurts this place is you have to know what you're looking for or else you will pass it.  I don't like the fact that I can't enter this center off of Eastern if I'm heading south from St. Rose.  If you turn on Coronado Center, it's the first driveway.    I stroll in, and the place is practically empty.  Bad for them, but that means I get my own sushi chef. Yay! As other people have mentioned, the fish is fresh... Very fresh.  Also, they are known for their rolls.  The rolls are very Americanized, which is something that I have a love/hate with.  Some of the rolls had a bit too much sauce for me (I like to taste my fish).  Don't get me wrong, they have sashimi and a limited traditional sushi menu, but it's pretty American.  I can understand the why behind it.  The cool thing is that when I just started asking for things not on the menu they could make it, which sparked an interesting \"where are you from\" conversation.  THE CHEF EVEN STARTED TO LEARN MY PALATE AND CATERED THE SUSHI TOWARDS ME!  That's service.  That's five stars!  Now, there is a bit of a language barrier with some of the chefs as English is definitely not their first language.  One of them even apologized to me at one point, I told them don't worry about it because it's not like I can speak his language anyway.  Also, I found the Korean influence on the menu interesting.  I'm certainly gonna go back and try the bulgogi.  I also loved that I could keep getting oranges for dessert-- orange that looked like a pumpkin, orange that looked like a cat.  Oh and they have Orion and another beer that is slipping my mind right now.  Whatever it was, it was $9, and boy was it tasty!  The best part was the staff themselves.  Did the waiter forget to refill my tea once?  Yes, but when he saw me pick up my glass and rushed to me apologizing profusely for his mistake.  It actually made me feel badly that he felt so badly about it.  The chefs were so much fun to hang out with.  I was laughing so hard at one point that I started crying.  Joon, Ken, and \"buy one get one free\" totally made my night.  I didn't feel like I was out to eat by myself, but like I was at a friend's house that could really cook."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is lacking,. Especially the Japanese looking lady who stands around. I'm not sure if she is a waitress or a supervisor but her attitude needs some improvement. I do not want to go into detail but my brother and I did not feel welcome at all. We felt insulted even because we eat a lot but then we ordered the AYCE so that should not have mattered. She kept talking to our servers until they came to use less and less frequently. She even held up an order for some reason before it finally reached us. We followed the rules on their AYCE menu so none of her attitude was called for. My brother and I agreed to find another sushi place as our go to. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. I just got done eating and I am amazed at the service and quality of the food! Shenna was amazing ! The best server I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Great service, pretty lenient on time limit when it's not busy, and also offers all you can drink. Not too many fancy rolls but definitely a great place to go if you're going for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is currently my favorite Sushi place!  I personally like that they bring items out 1-2 at a time, I hate having 50 plates at the table...just my opinion, but I can see by some reviews, some yelpers are gluttonous and are angry about that.  The ambiance is nice, I like the booths...I always feel that the service is good- one time I felt neglected by the female waitress, but today we had a different waiter (cant remember his name) but he is my favorite.  The screaming orgasm is delicious, as are the Who's Your Daddy-- I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great all u can eat and great service. We love coming here because we can get right in. Get the fresh sashimi"}
{"text":"Worst sushi bar ive ever been!! Service sucks the server was very rude and slow. And all sushi has too much rice. I dont even wanna give one star for this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a huge party of about 12 people or so. The waitress was nice enough to accommodate us by fitting the tables together for us.   To be honest, the sushi we had there including the sashimi was just alright. I've had better else where. But the sushi chef was so kind, he came to our table and I was assuming he asked if the food was good (I don't speak korean).  And at the end of our meal, because we were a big party, he served ice cream in a huge bowl. One for each table. When we left, the chef personally saw us out. But overall, despite the excellent service I don't think I will return for the food. Sorry chef!"}
{"text":"Love the handy Yelp app because we came across this place while in Vaughan last night. The reviews truly speak for itself. Service is just amazing and to top it off, the food was also fresh and delicious. The restaurant is quite small so we were lucky to get a table since it was a Friday night and got there early enough. My fiancé and I ordered the kalbi appetizer to start ...sooo good by far one of the best, it had so much flavour! And then small sushi & sashimi combo which was plentiful for the best of us. It came with 35 pcs for $30...totally worth it and every single piece of fish was fresh! They also gave us complimentary appetizers: vermicelli soup noodle and two specially made rolls. We loved the decor of the restaurant...Japanese style booths and even a cool sushi t-shirt hanging on the wall next to our table. To sum up our great experience, like every other review here, Chef Joseph came by to each table to ask how our meal was and even gave everyone free ice cream and candy! Now that is what you call personable and friendly service. We will definitely come back here if we are ever in the area. Stellar service and quality sushi!"}
{"text":"OMG, this place rocks!  I found it after my last favorite sushi place closed.  You MUST try the Superman Burrito Roll and the Dynamite Appetizer.  Their baked mussels are to die for and I LOVE the Screaming O Sashimi.  I can't get enough of this place and we're here a few times per month for the all you can eat.  Also the Bikini Roll is yummy, no rice, just sushi wrapped in cucumber.   Can't wait to go again on Friday!  Yummy!  :)"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see Sushi Wa did not have at least a 4+ star rating overall.  I was turned on to this place about a month ago from a colleague and have since been back twice.  The short story is:  I love it.  The $22 all you can eat lunch is a great value when you consider virtually everything on the menu is available, fresh and super delicious.  While the exterior of the restaurant is seriously underwhelming, the interior is very tastefully decorated with a cool modern vibe.  I also like how people can store their own chopsticks in these big racks with their names on the boxes.  I've had probably 6-7 different rolls, regular sushi, desert items (great Mochi) and have found portion sizes generous - and I reiterate most importantly - the fish was very fresh!  The service was also exceptional.  I've only sat at a table, so I can not comment about the Sushi Bar service experience.  All in all, I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the house noodles, it was a good appetizer that a lot of Korean restaurant no longer serve.  The salmon sashimi can use some improvement.  Presentation was really good.  I find the sushi roll rice a little hard.  Overall service was excellent. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Me and my husband absolutely LOVE this sushi spot. In fact we come here for every special occasion. Birthdays, anniversary, date nights. Its just that good! Romantic yet fun. The food is fenomenal I always eat my tush off! Haha"}
{"text":"Best fish in Vegas offering all you can eat. Joon gets his yellowtail from Japan, salmon from Scotland, halibut from Hawaii, etc. They care about offering a top product. The atmosphere is very modern and service is fast and friendly. Bring all my friends from out of town to have some great sushi."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend wanted to try sushi for our first time and we choose the right place! We did the all you can eat which was helpful in trying serval rolls for a good price. Our waitress was very helpful in advising what rolls we should chose! We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I was nervous about dining here as we'd noticed that many yelper friends had rated it just below taking a cruise off the italian coastline :). Alas, we were nearby and the Mrs and I decided to roll the dice.  Taking a gamble paid off. The yellowtail nigiri was some of the freshest and highest quality cuts I've had in Vegas. I thought the salmon was gonna swim off the plate and it tasted like butter.  We also tried the Pocky roll which is about 10lbs of avocado with some crab and albacore inside. I love avocado so this was yummers but it might be too much for some.  I've been back 2 more times, we did the all you can eat once. The price for all you can eat is competitive with other restaurants at this level but maybe even a little better as you get at least one serving of sashimi and one or two other specialty items which you wouldn't usually get with A.Y.C.E.  Highlights: -Pocky Roll -Mango Salmon Roll -Pokey Ahi Salad -Salmon Nigiri -Hamachi Nigiri -Banzai Roll -Good selection of asian beers including Hite which I didn't see on the menu but they did have in stock"}
{"text":"A.Y.C.E. SUSHI! Do you hear me?!?! ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!! (And at an affordable price!)  Who wouldn't like this place? You can pick just about anything off of the two-sided menu to order. However, be mindful of the color-coded symbols next to some of the items, because some items can only be ordered once as part of the AYCE special. And, it's more than just sushi: soup, teriyaki meals, appetizers, etc. Rolls are customizable (within reason) and I haven't had anything that I didn't like.   They sell Coke! In town that seems to be pro-Pepsi, it's so nice to have a nice cold Coke.  Service can be a little slow at times (not the wait for the food, but the initial acknowledgment from your server, which is a little odd since the restaurant isn't that large). However, their overall staff is pretty attentive, refilling drinks and clearing plates at a healthy pace.   This has become our \"go to\" sushi place for us. I can't wait to start bringing our out-of-town guests here."}
{"text":"Where to start... This is not an authentic Japanese restaurant!  We sat at the sushi bar, but can't order directly to the chefs in front of us. Why??because we had the all you can eat menu.  When you have an all you can eat menu and put tons of restrictions;  it is not all you can eat. I guess that's why we had to order from the wait staff. They were the ones to make sure we didn't order anything not on the \"all you can eat\" menu. The good part.. The fish was decent, but something is always lost in translation when non native people try to present themselves as authentic! I would have given this place a high rating, but they choose to play the bait and switch game with their customers. We got our bill and saw that they included gratuity in all our bills even though we had separate checks. They even charged more than the percentage stated(also mentioned by Andy S.)  So, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here is fresh and unique. In Vegas is the best place for your money. Clean environment, great staff and just great sushi. Highly recommend for anyone to try. JJ is one of my favorites sushi Chef but others are good too. I like the fact that they have cold Sake on draft, they call it bamboo. I wish all sushi places had sake on draft. They should learn from sushiwa."}
{"text":"We drove a long way to have dinner here. There is only one waitress, and we were waiting almost 30mins for the food. These rolls we ordered are not bad. We ordered a small Sashimi boat. However, there are only five kinds of fish, and the Salmon Sashimi are not fresh enough. Tuna Sashimi are OK, but no particular comment for the other sashimi in the boat, not good or bad. Overall, three stars for everything."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in 4 years, so when we were in this part of town we decided to drop in to do some all you can eat. Long story short the hostess sucked from the moment we walked in, til I signed the check and was walking out. Even the worst restaurants  I've been to, had the respect to say \"thank you\" after I spent a good sum of $$. But not today...no \"thank you,\" no \"hope you enjoyed it,\" not even an \"f*** you,\" as I walked by thanking them. For what? Not quite sure.  Wasn't a total loss, our Server was okay and the rolls were excellent, but not enough for me to come all the way back again."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the area; it doesn't have \"all you can eat\" menus but it's definitely worth getting their dishes which are very tasty and generous in size. The chefs and the waitress are very friendly and sometimes give some free treats!"}
{"text":"The best sushi ever!!!!!! This is a great place for All you can eat sushi ! The staff are friendly and the fish is always fresh."}
{"text":"Mmmmm I felt like this place had some good stuff and other stuff was mediocre. I don't want to diss but state some suggestions in hopes that they will make it better for the future.   I was mostly dissapointed in the presentation but service was great. Everything just kind of came out mediocre.. can't really say it any better.   My dragon roll looked like there was barely any unagi on top and the shrimp tempura was so small I couldn't taste it.  The salmon skin salad needs help.. just doesn't look like anything, random veggies put together and the salmon skin tasted like some other fish since it was way over cooked and cut so small....  The sushi was all very good and again service was awesome. I would definitely come back but I know what not to order and what to order.  Ya feel me? Oh plus I appreciate how late it is open!"}
{"text":"Food was good , Farley priced! Great Service !! Nothing really to complain about . For two people the portions were big for us like the rolls it would have been nice to just do half of them. Too rich to each eat four of the same thing. My only complaint!!  Portions were big for a sushi place lol ! Weird I know but my preference only!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa has always been mine and my family's first choice to visit when we want to dine out for Sushi. Past visits have been good, sometimes great, but to say the least never bad. Food is good, ambience of the restaurant is also good with great music. Last night's visit however makes me think twice about visiting this restaurant.  We were seated in a booth (there were four of us) across from the sushi bar. One server came and took drink orders and provided us with the menus. He appeared to be out waiter but to find out he wasn't. After the drinks arrived and we made our selection we waited for a bit. The server than showed up with our plates, took our order (AYCE). After the first round of order was almost finished we wanted to put in another order and this is when the issue began.  We got our server's attention and asked if we can put in another order - her response was \"please wait a little bit\". She then proceeded to walk the restaurant, checking on other tables, booth, and bar area, giggling and talking with these guests. About five minutes passed and I again flagged her down and asked her if I can order. Her response \"If you put in another order now, because the kitchen is backed up, it will come out slow.\" All of us with exception of my husband ( as we were all speaking in Korean) looked at her with shock. She was actually telling us that we can't order the food because sushi chefs were busy! It felt as though she was scolding us about our pace and how orders should be placed based on the convenience of the sushi chefs. After the shock settled we advised her that we will be understanding of the wait (as few large tables arrived) and she finally took the order. She continued to \"ignore\" our table and only visit when we flagged her down throughout the dinner.  At the end of our dinner my mother asked her if we can order dessert. Her response was even more shocking to use. She began looking around the table and noticed three lumps of rice that was left on the plate. She began to lecture my mother how that is not the policy of their AYCE and the restaurants need to charge us for the left overs. She also pointed to where her boss was seating and told us that He had pulled her aside and spoke to her about our table, how we can't continue to leave lumps of rice. She also added that she can be fired by all of this. Then she called out to one of the servers to come and take our dessert order.   I am not sure if this is the service that is given to all patrons at this restaurant or she feels that she is comfortable enough to talk or provide lack of service to us because we are Koreans. I have received better service at Dick's last resort in San Diego and their motto is to be rude (fun rude) to their customers. The way that our table was served and spoken to is definitely not something I expect to receive when spending over $100 at a restaurant. In addition, to be told when I can place my order and getting scolded at the end of the dinner is certainly not the way I wanted end my dinner with my family.  To say the least, Sushi Wa will never be our first, second, or last choice to dine. Our server's performance definitely left us wondering if the money spent was worth is and obviously it is not."}
{"text":"When we walked in, it definitely felt like a modern/unique Japanese restaurant. The lighting was more dim lit and intimate which we liked. We walked over to the sushi bar and really the ambiance is all that made the experience. It took about 5 minutes for them to figure out we didn't have menus, the chef at the sushi bar didn't speak much English (he was hispanic) so he kept disregarding us, we didn't have a set waiter for our drinks and appetizers, and they forgot to bring us three items we ordered. To top it off, I think it's silly that you can't share with others in your party that ordered AYCE. The sushi wasn't all that great and I'm pretty sure I won't go back there."}
{"text":"Boyfriend was craving sushi & this place is literally down the street from where we live so we decided to check it out even tho a lot of the yelp reviews mentioned horrible service. I don't know if it's because we came for lunch and it wasn't busy, but everything was AMAZING!   We were immediately greeted & seated upon entering the restaurant which was surprisingly large & beautifully decorated. We sat at the bar and chose to have the AYCE. Our waiter was extremely polite and helpful in explaining the menu. His timing on checking in on our needs was perfect. The sushi chef even checked in on us periodically to see if we wanted to order anything else. So to sum it all up, it's unfortunate that so many yelpers had bad experiences here with their service but thankfully, ours was PERFECT! We'll definitely be back!  And the icing on the cake... SUSHI WAS FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice picking up orders for customers who've ordered from Postmates, and decided to grab some take-out this morning. First of all, they are open til 4 a.m. which is perfect for a night owl like me. Second of all, the service is super responsive and food preparation is very quick.  Lastly, the sashimi & sushi are amazing!  I ordered cucumber salad, garlic tuna, sex bomb, and the salmon roll (spicy because I LOVE hot!) I have eaten sushi in many cities and this ranks in my top 3.  I will def come back for AYCE ($23, lunch/$27,dinner) soon.  This is my new late nite sushi spot."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the price is also very fair. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in an upscale sushi establishment. From my experience the fish has always been very fresh here and the fish to rice ratio is also very good. They dont try to overly fill you up with rice. The staff is super friendly. We like sitting at the sushi bar where we can converse with the chefs and of course get our food that much quicker."}
{"text":"This was the first time at Sushi Wa for my wife and I. We received excellent service from the moment we walked in. Our server seated us and served us tea very promptly. We placed our order and when the first item arrived we were a bit puzzled trying to figure out if we had actually ordered it, only to later find out that it was a complimentary deep fried tuna appetizer on the house! Everything just got phenomenally better from here. The Geisha roll was fabulous and midway through the meal, Chef Joseph personally made a stop at our table to chat with us and wrote down our names. He was pleased to find out that it was our first time at the restaurant and offered us the most amazing mango ice cream with honey cornflakes on the house! Once we paid our bill at the counter, he personally walked over to say goodbye to us (he remembered our names!); offered us candy; walked us out the door and waved till we got in the car! At this point, in a state of complete euphoric excitement, my wife and I looked at each other trying to process what had just happened! The experience was almost unbelievable since it's so rare to find people like Joseph these days, with a genuine commitment to serving customers sincerely. I'd highly recommend anyone reading this to go check out Sushi Wa. Hands down, the best sushi restaurant in the North York area!"}
{"text":"Came with my cousins for the AYCE because of the 4 stars. We were really excited to find a new sushi place but we were really disappointed. We weren't satisfied with any of our orders and the sushi rice was terrible. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service from the owner and the food is on-point. Would highly recommend to friend's, family, and any sushi lover."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is always amazing!!!! Service is just as good!! Love the sushi selection one of my favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"Ambiance is modern and sleek. Service is good; the employees are nice and helpful. The fish is fresh and the rolls are amazing; i got the garlic tuna sashimi and several other rolls that were pretty good. They serve beer and sake; I got the cold house sake."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi and great decor. Waiters are friendly and the drinks inventive. If you like sushi you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Had a very very bad experience here, mark our server is very rude.. From the very beginning while ordering our food on AYCE, he stated \"this is a lot of food\" he made us feel right away that we are \"too much\". (We are eating sushi AYCE almost 3x a week so we know what we can eat and we know what we want..  Secondly, im surprised with the sushi theres a lot of RICE and very thin fish.. And the sashimi you can only order one..almost seems like they actually prepared it with more rice on the fact that we ordered a lot..   third, he is watching us like we are criminals eating sushi, hes like the walking camera which is so annoying!!!! He likes to question us every time we are making an order.. Like \"are you sure?\"  I don't think ill be coming back here.. The food taste good tho and the place was really nice, the other staff seems very friendly and nice but MARK.."}
{"text":"Really delicious lunch meal and priced well. Bento box shrimp tempura came with miso soup, green tea, small summer soup & edamame ( Not sure how to spell it). I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The staff is very attentive and the food is so good! I love the ambience and decor. Very modern and cozy with the dim lights. All in all 5/5 in taste, comfort, and service!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Postmates, that nighmare is another story. The restaurant manager admitted they \"don't use real crab and don't have time to write every detail on the menu.\" The staff took turns yelling at me. $200 for garbage. Why the high reviews? Not ONE thing we ordered was as described on the menu and it took two hours for the pleasure of being tremendoulsy disappointed."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5/5 stars to restaurants unless they blow me away. And trust me, I'm very critical about the places I go to.  My partner and I went to sushi wa based on yelp reviews. We were expecting really good food and nothing else. I mean, it's not a Michelin star restaurant so my expectations were not high.  We arrived and the place was semi busy. We got seated right away. There were a few tables and it felt cozy.  We ordered a few appetizers, maki rolls, and sushi. We loved all of the food. The rolls and sushi are a lot smaller. We noticed that the chef puts garnishs on the sushi which was a lovely touch. It's the little details that make your experience better.  Near the end of the night, the chef, Joseph, came by to our table to greet us and ask us how our food was. He asked us for our names and grabbed our desserts. It was very sweet of him. He didn't do this for us, but when a table leaves he comes outside with you to say goodbye. Joseph and the staff were very attentive and blew us away with their service. This is why they get 5/5 stars and they'll see me again!"}
{"text":"This sushi place was delicious, had great food presentation, and (I'm assuming?) the chef/owner even came to our table and asked how the food was. He took time to learn our names and we got free hand rolls and ice cream! The setting is nice too, a Japanese vibe due to interior design of the restaurant (the Japanese cloth stuff idk what they're called). The waiter was very friendly and overall had an amazing experience. Definitely recommend this sushi place and would come here again!"}
{"text":"First time here in a while and first time for dinner. This will be my new go to spot for ayce in Henderson. Staff was very attentive sushi chef was friendly and food came at a great pace. Food was fresh and had great flavors. My 12 year old who loves sushi ate the most she ever has and tried many things. I will definitely be a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've visited this restaurant and it was great! The staff is friendly and the food is terrific. They have \"all you can eat\" if you like and a great menu! I can't believe we've missed this place tucked in the middle of the shopping center before now."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fish is super fresh. This is my go-to local spot, I've never had a bad experience ever"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We ordered uni that came to our table looking discolored and smelling really weird, we told our server and he's like \"well if it's bad then don't eat it.\" What a ridiculous response!  At one point we also tried to order more and our server was like \"you have more food coming...just wait\" and he refused to take our order.  Overall just tremendously rude. Sushi was not fresh. Lots of rice that was way too filling."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Delicious sushi, salads and soup. Quick and friendly service and owner, Joseph, was so sweet. This will be our new go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is my favorite place to come for sushi. The Japanese lasagna and garlic tuna are really good here.  The servers are friendly and the service is good."}
{"text":"Small place with a big heart  His is not an upscale restaurant, however, the Food is very tasty, nice size dishes and the owner is very nice Best sushi in a 3 km radius"}
{"text":"All you can eat and very nice atmosphere.  Not the best sushi in town but is pretty good!  The side dishes are pretty good and they have a lot of choice.  Recommend the nigiri ones rather than the rolls.  Price is average for ayce sushi.  Will continue to frequent here."}
{"text":"Another sushi joint owned by Koreans. This means that they also have a couple (ribs and bulgogi) on their [AYCE] menu. I enjoyed coming here, but it is hard to make it a consistent visit because it can get quite pricey even without the AYCE.  I suggest coming here to eat their uni (sea urchin) and octopus though! It is one of the most fresh sushi joints for those two that I have had!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places in town. The all you can eat is so incredible! I've never felt so great leaving a sushi restaurant, this place will take care of all you sushi needs and more.  Great staff, great atmosphere and great food. A must go for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for all you can eat. We used to live on the opposite side of town and would drive across town for this place. Their sushi is fresh and They have great drinks too! I had my birthday at this place and we always bring family in here when they are in town!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in las vegas area.  Try the Hawaiian roll and superman burrito!  Fish quality is better than other places and the flavors are popping! Decor is nice as well and adds to the experience.  Sushi chefs are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Was ok people are friendly sushi you can not order half order on all you can eat.  Sushi was ok fair."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi!  Wonderful Service , if you want some of the Best Las Vegas, NV (Henderson) Sushi  this is a Must Try!!  Each time we go here, it is never a disappointment. #ChefDanny, #Amazingg!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date night. We did all you can eat and the sushi was extremely fresh. My boyfriend loves nigiri and the fish portions were way more generous than many other all you can eat sushi places. I highly recommend the wa salad. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time, decided to finally write a review. This is my fave sushi spot by far. Fish is always fresh, I never get any bad pieces, no matter what time or day I go. And I love the mussels. Favorite roll- superman burrito."}
{"text":"I love this place. The only downside I've experienced is parking sucks on a busy weekend night with my big ass truck. But that's a really hardly a quibble when you're talking about the fantastically savory menu--food and drink--here. I love the decor and the service has been splendid whether I've come as two or twenty-two (the latter being my first experience and we damn near ran the kitchen out the house with the all you can eat option). Speaking of that opportunity--they call it the AYCE--if you've got the hungry and the stomach space to match, do it. You won't regret it save for the weight gain. Get your sushi here."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to SushiWa in forever and decided to revisit the first place I had tried Live Uni (YUM!!) earlier this week. To those who've never dined at this sushi joint, you need to look at the specials board BEFORE you peruse the extensive menu. That's where these talented folks showcase their fresh, seafood delicacies, and you can decide how adventurous you want to be with what you eat! This time around, my bizarre food moment came with my first taste of torigai (Japanese Cockle)... last time, it was geoduck (large clam). That's not to say that the folks at SushiWa don't do everything else... you can certainly find your fair share of fresh sashimi (their yellowtail, salmon and tuna are always good), and all the crazy rolls you can eat. I would also highly recommend their crispy rice -- a thin layer of crisped rice on top of which is a perfect portion of spicy tuna and other accoutrements including some caviar eggs -- DELISH! SushiWa is a little bit more expensive than some of the other sushi joints in town... but I don't mind paying more for a food adventure now and then. GO. And make sure to have your own Andrew Zimmern moment."}
{"text":"Annoying and weird. First two words that come to mind. Oh--and pretty bad service. Made reservations, arrived on time. Only 6 tables were sat when we arrived, most of which already had their food. The restaurant is pretty small, so with 3 working sushi chefs and a back of house staff and several servers, it's really odd that their ticket times are as long as they are. They looked overstaffed IMO.  For starters, I know it's annoying to serve families, I've worked in everything from franchises to fine dining. If serving families is too overwhelming to you--you should work at a bar.   We ordered AYCE, and two of my kids just ordered regular entrees. We knew what we wanted ahead of time, figuring it would make it easy for the server. Nope.  Our daughter's COOKED entree came out, soup first then 10 mins later--  the rest of her entree. About another 10-15 mins went by and we were still waiting for JUST our sashimi. With 3 chefs, a slow restaurant that was clearing out, NO OTHER patrons even entered--and we still didn't get a few pieces of raw fish. On top of that, the waitress seemed VERY overwhelmed & flustered. She's in the wrong industry. If you can't wait on a *few* tables, I.. I.. don't know. It was almost funny.   Our two kids finished their meals, then finally a few plates started to trickle out. We didn't want to be rude,but we eat sushi all the time, we've been there several times, so we needed to know why it was taking so long. The waitress (who was still very flustered) blamed the kitchen then mumbled then said \"well you're not the only people eating and they're making lots of food right now\". Meanwhile, when we looked over, two of the three sushi chefs were just standing there, not visibly busy.   Wherever. So we just wanted to eat & go home. We ordered a bunch of rolls. She then says \"you can only order 6 at a time\". It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or on any sign. Every AYCE place would gladly bring (which would calculate to 2 rolls per person) what we ordered gladly because they always charge for what you don't finish. #whyareyouweird she was being lazy. I get it, you don't want to carry plates and do side work. So we just took a few rolls off our order as we knew we'd never go back there again & we didn't feel like driving to another restaurant since it's a school night.   Anyway, the sushi was good, but not good enough to go back. We'll be sticking with restaurants elsewhere. It's a shame and really their loss. They lost a lot of future business."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Didn't have to ask for anything more than once. Joon helped us at the bar the entire time and the sushi was incredible. Fish was fresh and the bulgogi was delicious. Myself and two others had all you can eat lunch and our bill was $70. Unbelievable food for that price. Service and food for this price is the best on this side of Vegas."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere for local sushi restaurant, lounge-like. Miko and Yoon always delivery excellent service. This has become my go to spot for sushi. Also, it's s plus they're always open at 4am. I would definitely recommend the vanilla mochi, I've never had creamier vanilla ice cream than that! Although all of their mochi is fantastic. They even have coffee mochi. Good variety of items on menu. I would just hope they work on the batter of their fried items, they tend to taste bitter and like you're chewing oil, no flavor at all. Pork belly could use more flavor rather than just relying on the sauce to add flavor. Bulgogo is surprising good here! Lots of flavor, even comes on a skillet. Miso soup is never overly salty."}
{"text":"The staff here really go out of their way to be attentive! Chef Joseph makes a point of stopping by and asking how everything is, and remembers your name when you come back! The on-the-house appetizers are delicious, with a seafood broth and a crunchy and flavourful deep-fried tuna roll. Top quality sushi whether you dine in or get take out. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"My experience here was very upsetting. Food was alright but service was bad. The Asian lady that was a waitress was so rude, and wasn't helpful at all. There was other people sitting in our table that ordered food too and after we ordered. I waited and waited for my ordered and a few things I didn't get. after I asked where they were and she said it came together with the other peoples food sitting on the same table. I wasn't aware that it was put together with our orders put together. SMH."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Never felt so welcomed in a restaurant. Joseph was great. Very good food and value for the price. Will bring kids back to eat again."}
{"text":"Come here 5 years in a row to celebrate my birthday and worth the trip every time! Good food and good service! Wa special roles are super special! Happy Birthday to me!"}
{"text":"Another great experience tonight. Best AYCE in town in terms of service, quality and variety of rolls.  Gio does a stellar job in managing the room."}
{"text":"Say it in a Snookie voice... \"Sushi Waaaaaa\". Wow, what a dated reference.  This location is right next door to my barber and I've been wanting to try this place for the past couple of months. Sushi Wa has the basic look and feel of the old standard sushi bar, but with food items like the Super Spider Roll, Shrimp Killer, and the Superman Burrito Roll, needless to say the menu is far from basic.   I rolled in (pun intended) around 3pm and the place was empty, perfect! My lunching partner and I sat at the bar and ordered a small meal because we were in a bit of rush. We stayed on the beaten path as far sushi orders go with Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll, Calamari Tempura Roll, and a bowl of Udon. Like I said, \"we were in a rush\", which now I realize is bad idea to go to a new place and not take the time to snack on their interesting and funky faire.   The Calamari Tempura Roll was plated beautifully and set the tone for my hunger right off the bat. The large rolls filled with crab, avocado, and coated in a tasty fish sauce were not only easy on the eyes, but they didn't stand a chance against to my chopstick to mouth skills. This plate was accompanied with a generous helping tempura calamari along with little dollops of japanese mayo and dots of spicy oil in the center. Amazing!  The Udon was a nice break from the calamari munching mayhem. The noodles were cooked to firm perfection and the broth would have been slurped down with a straw if the server would have obliged my gluttonous tendencies. The fish cakes and tempura veggies that came with soup were a welcomed addition to this large bowl of awesome.   The Spicy Tuna Roll, fell flat. I mean like Wile E. Coyote falling from a cliff flat. So much so that I didn't finish it, which says a lot. Who doesn't finish sushi? I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just had an interesting texture and a weird flavor profile.   This location still gets a 4 stars because just like the majority of the meal, the service was stellar and I didn't walk out feeling like my wallet was just bent over and taken advantage of. I will be back to try aforementioned rolls and this time there will be no time crunch, just seaweed wrapped, saki soaked, sushi eating enjoyable dining."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight.    I think they were \"off their A-game\" in the service department.  I'm not going to go into detail because I'm not going to hold it against them... but my tea was cold, they forgot to provide: the individual small plates, the soy sauce dish and the wasabi/ginger side.  But all was remedied quickly once we pointed it out.    They are OH-SO-NICE.  So.... definitely not going to hold the minor infractions against them since the sushi and rolls were Killer Grinds.  Enjoyed the AYCE... started with the edamame and seaweed salad.  Both were great starters... fresh and fast.  Then started in on the fish... salmon, yellow tail, white tuna.  All very good and fresh....and big pieces of fish too which just a little bit of rice.... so they are more than fair with their portions.  Ordered the albacore with jalapeno... it came wrapped in red onion which I'm not a fan of onion so I picked the onion out and ate it.  Was Great without the onion.  :)  Then we ordered the Scallop Crunch, Mountain and 007 rolls.  They were all different and all good... I can't say which I liked better.  The Scallop Crunch had a nice crunch to it while the scallops were tender, the Mountain was a baked roll that was served with a spicy sauce that was awesome... just a nice little kick nothing shocking... and the 007 roll was so simple it was refreshing.  We ended with Tempura Ice Cream... it was 'ok'.  Nothing to expound upon... should have gotten the Mochi instead... next time."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything you order!  Fresh, lots of choices and delicious!  Will definitely come back every time I visit. My favorite is the Halibut sushi with obo leaf and lemon.  And they pepper seared tuna is so flavorful."}
{"text":"Super good sushi!! And vegan friendly!! Great atmosphere and staff is always super attentive. Perfect sushi spot!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat is the way to go! If you can, sit at the bar. The sushi chef's are very friendly and give great suggestions"}
{"text":"A great Sushi place, amazing AYCE sushi menu....gonna take a return visit to try all the menu but was not disappointed on any dish.  Fav was pepper seared Tuna but I love sashimi(available on the AYCE)...so many rolls on the menu it would take 8-10 visits to try it all.  Tapas menu and more!  Becoming my fav sushi place in Henderson bar none"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Excellent value and thanks to Joseph the store owner.  I went there 4 months ago.  Delayed review sorry."}
{"text":"Went for our Anniversary and this is usually always our spot to go eat Sushi and we honestly hadn't been in a long long time. We had Ricky \"JJ\" and he was just fabulous... Good to converse with and he made us a little anniversary surprise... Top Secret stuff! Just so much flavor and refreshing. It's great to return to a place and get the same excellent service and delicious meals. The fish is always top quality and fresh.   Ahi Poke *best poke in town* Rose Roll *very filling Pepper Seared Tuna Salmon Crunch Roll Rainbow Roll *Ricky's Original* Promised I would not give out secrets..."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for AYCE sushi. While the sushi and sashimi we ate were fresh and delicious, the service was mediocre. Our drinks weren't filled until the end of our dining experience; at one point, it took us quite a while to get the attention of our server so we could order more. However, I would give this place another chance as the food made up for the service. The Screaming Orgasm sashimi was mouth-watering, and the rolls I ordered were flavorful and filling."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. June is phenomenal, staff is great. If you're looking for sushi, this is the only place to go."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after living right up the hill for almost a year. Definitely the best place we've been to south of 215. Everything we had was good, it was later in the afternoon, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Would have been a great experience but our server/waitress older chubby Asian lady was not letting us order our full order saying we order too much and said order next time, my wife only ate 2 things and was waiting for her veggie tempura, pork belly and chicken katsu which were canecelled, can't believe I paid full price please retrain the waitress, this would be a 0 star rating if I could select no stars"}
{"text":"Amazing.  This place has the freshest sushi I have ever tasted.  I used to think I knew fresh fish, but clearly I was wrong.  Once I ate the yellowtail nigiri here, it was so flavorful and delicious that I thought he must have killed the fish himself just a few seconds earlier.  (I found out later that this was, in fact, the case.)  Same went for the baby tuna, and the salmon, and it was simply amazing.    I'd definitely try the Monkey Brain, it was amazingly good, with a shiitake mushroom, cream cheese, and spicy tuna on top, covered in tempura and fried.  Very good.  They have an interesting selection of other fish, as well, and the rolls are pretty good, too.  Keep in mind, from 11:30 to 3, Mon-Sat, they have happy hour, which many of the sushi items are half off, and this is what I recommend to just sit and sample the fresh nigiri.  If you come at dinner, get the rolls.  All of them are gigantic, and more than worth the full price.    The place itself is very well decorated, with stone and contemporary stylings, although the music in there can be hit or miss.  I've been there about 3 times now, and one time it was bouncy loud hip-hop crap with repetitive rhythms and vocalists who talk the whole time instead of singing.  The second time it was techno remixes of pop songs, and that was more bearable.  The third time was nice, with more Japanese style singing and a little bit of a trance feel, and a little bit of a big-band feel.    Very good place over all...  Freshest fish I've ever had."}
{"text":"Go to spot in Henderson for nigiri. Try the \"Sushi Bomb\" but be cautious, it will explode and all you can do is hold on for the ride."}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi! If we could afford it we would be eating sushi like they do in Japan...breakfast lunch and dinner! We've been to sushi places everywhere and we know what we like and we know how much we can eat. Oh did I mention my husband started off as a sushi chef? Well, we went to Sushi Wa with high expectations from one of our best friends...and I must admit...the sushi was great as we were told. But here's the sad thing...the waitress we got every time we go there always limits our orders! I mean c'mon...we know what we wanna eat...and we're paying all you can eat and if we can't finish it you still charge us for unfinished food...so why limit us? That type of service is not needed...and on top of that they always take forever to bring the food and the bill. You would think if we placed a larger order in the beginning then you wouldn't have to worry about coming back to our table. I think it's rude to limit your customers when they're paying to eat All You Can Eat!   I'll score 2 stars on great food and deduct the 3 stars for service.   Sad thing is..my husband and I miss their sushi (especially the nigiri and sashimi sushi). We are not sushi rolls type of people :/  We'll see if we go back or not."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not enough Vegan options. Katie is the best server there.  She's warm, friendly and takes time to explain the menu. If i ever go there again , I  ask for Katie because everyone else is so rude. Jenny had the nerve to take make water glass away and bring it back filled with a dirty glass and already squeezed lemon. Disgusting! She also had the nerve to question my husband about ordering before I knew what I wanted. Very rude! 5 stars if they add more vegan items to the menu and get rid of the rude staff!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of sushi restaurants with AYCE and Sushi Wa hands down is the best one. Their staff is great, their food is great, the room ambience is great, and plus its open till 4 freakin' AM like what theee?!?! Anyways, my personal favorite order is favorite roll is the Mango Roll (I'm pretty sure it's only from this place too since from the other places I've been they don't have it) and I totally recommend that with some green tea tempura ice cream!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The worlds best eel ever! So much amazing sushi! You know it's so good that over order but it's worth every time! I keep coming back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic.      We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled.       Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding.     Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on the good reviews on Yelp, and this is the first time we've been disappointed. The sushi was ok. The garlic sauce seemed really oily, and not even that garlicky. The most disappointing part was the speed of service. If I knew we'd have to wait 15 minutes between each order, I would have just ordered everything at once. It took 2 hours just to get 4 rolls and several small dishes from the kitchen. I've never been to a sushi place that has taken this long to get the food out to the customer. Kind of funny how they say you only have an hour for AYCE, but it took 2."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, but not as much as the guilt I feel for subjecting my friends to the disaster that occurred on Friday night. What I thought would be a fun sushi night turned out to be a nightmare. I left before witnessing said nightmare, but from hearing what really happened, my review would be much lower if I had been there. If I had known what I know now about the service, particularly one waiter, I would have picked one of the many other sushi joints in the area.   Anyways, the sushi was pretty good. Highlights of the AYCE were the very crunchy calamari w/ two choices of dipping sauce, the Hamachi Kama, and the Seared Tuna Nigiri. Portions are big, especially the rolls. Some of the seafood could have been fresher, like the Uni; but, overall, the sushi was satisfactory. The food alone deserves 3 stars.   What doesn't deserve 3 stars is the service. At first, the service was good, our server was nice. At this point, my review was sitting pretty at 3 stars. But as the night progressed, I could tell our server was getting frustrated due to the orders and the amount of people at the restaurant. Large parties are always difficult, I understand that; however, if everyone in the table is ordering AYCE, it shouldn't be difficult to split the bill. Having to leave early, I needed to pay early. After asking our server multiple times if I could pay early, he finally agreed (after saying no initially) and took my card. However when I got the bill, I immediately knew something wasn't right. I was overcharged by $3 or so, but I was in a hurry, so I just paid and left it at that. Service deserves 2 stars.   Maybe the server was having an off night, but I made reservations in advance for our large party, so they should've been more prepared. I'm kind of relieved I missed the fiasco that occurred after I left because if I had stayed, I definitely would have lived up to the Sushi Wa name and cried (*Wa wa*).  For small parties, Sushi Wa is a-ok, but large parties beware!  *EDIT* One of the owners contacted me and apologized for what happened, hence the bump to three stars."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I think this restaurant is best sushi restaurant in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa has the best sushi in all Vegas and Henderson!!!!  They have the best menu and Jenny is the most incredible server we have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Came in a bit less than an hour of closing time to have a beer, got an udon soup and sushi on the house! Extremely attentive and all together a very welcoming environment, loved it and definitely recommend for such a service!"}
{"text":"Just came home from a disappointing visit at Sushi Wa. Wish I had gone back to Oyshi instead. Service staff was pleasant and attentive, but out of three chefs, there was only one who was pleasant, and he wasn't the one serving me. The menu was explained poorly. One order of sashimi per person, (huh?) and one order of sweet shrimp.. description that took much longer than necessary to get across. I had eaten the rest of my food (2 rolls, 3 different orders of sushi, the sashimi, and a couple of appetizers) and the sweet shrimp was MIA. The one pleasant chef, upon my inquiry, mentioned it was coming. But it felt like every time I spoke to my chef, I was bothering him. And what was his name? Well, according to their chef jackets, they were all named Joon Choi. The sweet shrimp came out right as I was asking about dessert. I had given up. To be fair, the quality of the fish was good. 4 stars for that. But there was so much more that was wrong. The rolls were poorly wrapped, the carrot in one of the rolls should have been thrown away. I had to pick it out! Seriously. I tried their Korean Bulgogi. Bad. Just Bad. And then... the sweet shrimp arrived. I. Have. Never. Had. Shrimp. This. Bad. I couldn't eat it. I asked for the red bean mocha. The waitress asked if I wanted it as I finished the rest of my food. When I indicated I was not going to do so, she told me they charged for pieces I didn't eat. I understand that policy is in place to keep down waste... but when I told her the food was undesirable, she didn't really say anything. In the end, they took it off my bill. But what a waste of a night of sushi! I ended up feeling full but  extremely dissatisfied. Never again."}
{"text":"The chefs do not deserve this. The food is pretty great and quite fresh. However, the service at this restaurant was absolutely atrocious and quite a hostile environment. When my family and I came here for the AYCE, we expected a great meal. After a few orders, the waiters (and what I assume is the owner) got tired of coming and we were forced to wait 15-20 minutes between orders. The owner brought us our check before we even asked for it and kept staring and laughing at me. I assume this is because I'm a big man and can eat quite a bit. They forgot quite a few of our orders as well. If you have a big stomach but no soul, I suggest you eat here because the owner seems to lack one as well as soon as he sees customers who can eat quite a bit. Otherwise, if you want a non-hostile and nice service staff, I suggest you eat at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Sushi ! The best experience since long time. Small place, excellent 5 stars service. Food great and price was not crazy like some other places. A must try place if you like sushi."}
{"text":"So we just ate here for the first time tonight.  We love at Bathurst and Wilson and have been going to wakame which has gone down hill faster than usain bolt can run.   The food here was fantastic!!!  The service was impeccable.   Hey brought out free appetizers with some newer dishes on their menu. Delish!!  The avocado salad was amazing.  The rolls equally as good. The kicker on the whole meal was when the head chef and owner, Joseph, came out to ask is how the food was, where we lived, how we had heard about them and then proceeded to ask our names and wrote them down in his little book.    Needless to say, we will be back over and over again."}
{"text":"I don't know if they get much business here because the mall it's in seems kind of quiet. But... what a great find! It's a place I'd imagine in Santa Monica or West Hollywood only not as crowded and not pretentious.  The tofu salad was very tasty. I generally don't like Japanese salad dressings but the one on this was quite good. On the other hand, I had a seared tuna salad that was a little too heavy on the dressing and I couldn't taste the fish.  I'm a purist when it comes to fish. Give me sashimi! However, it's fun for me to look at a menu and see that mango is being used in rolls. I tried the salmon skin roll the last time I was there and can honestly say I'd recommend it.  There's something on the menu called, \"monkey brains\" but I noticed it on the way out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Definitely one of the top all you can eat sushi restaurants in the Henderson area. Great atmosphere and very clean. Sushi is always fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited here numerous times.  We decided to go on 07 April 2018 at around 14:00.  As we entered, Joseph behind the counter immediately said hello.  The waiter, I think his name was Aaiden, greeted us right away.  He cleaned off a table, and we were seated.  The place was packed.  It isn't all that large, but this was the first time that it was so busy.  They upgraded their menu and their prices.  However, the food was exceptional and the service was excellent.  Joseph, the owner came by three times to our table to make sure everything was in order.  The food was excellent and satisfying.  When we left, Aaiden thanked us and the other waiter as well.  Walking out the door, and heading for my car, Joseph came outside and called out to thank us and bowed.  You don't receive service like this anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!!! The sushi was fresh and tasty and my waiter was really nice. I think this is my new favorite!!! Great AYCE deal at lunch and dinner and their menu has plenty of options. YUMMY!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here last night and am happy I tried it but I probably won't be back.  We had a very nice server although she was kind of all over the place.  Several times she tried to deliver our items to the tables next to us and then did the same with the other table's order.  Kind of strange and not so good since it's food related.  Now onto the food!  They do not offer half rolls for the AYCE however they do offer your choice of 1 of the sashimi options which is nice because that is not something that is normally offered at AYCE.  The sashimi came with 4 nice size slices of fish.  Delish!  For the sushi options, they give a lot of rice and are pretty strict on the leftover policy.  They probably give about double what a normal AYCE sushi restaurant would do in terms of rice.  They have a nice selection of mochi flavors including coffee which was so good!  Overall the experience was just OK.  I liked the variety that they offer but the rice overload, no half rolls, and mix ups with orders were a bit too many flaws for me to go back"}
{"text":"Free beer with the yelp review!! Score!! Our server is polite and informative, this will be a definite come back spot for me"}
{"text":"Came here for my bday and the sushi was great! We come here for the AYCE the \"sushi\" (shasmimi) is always fresh. The white peach blossom drink is super tasty with a fizz, (12$). Favorite rolls in include the Japanese lasagna, the philledelphia roll, and the mango salmon roll! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here with some buddies for the All-You-Can-Eat option and it was NOT disappointing in the least!   For $25.95, we ate some of the best sushi we've ever eaten, and in copious amounts. I ordered approximately 7 or 8 rolls, and I enjoyed all of them, though the Mexican Roll was my favorite.   The neat thing about the AYCE was also that it included appetizers. The Spicy Chicken was fantastic and the gyoza were decent. Another highlight was the chocolate mochi for dessert  :)  The service was excellent as well. The waitresses were all very funny and accommodating. They also were very good at moderating how often they came to the table with the next round of rolls so we were never overwhelmed by the amount of plates on the table.  Definently a great place for a good AYCE deal on sushi! Come if you're hungry for fresh fish at its best!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new restaurant to try out and we're craving sushi. This place was nearby and had great reviews. Quaint and quiet with beautifully prepared dishes, good quality and superb service. Our waitress was kind and attentive, sushi chef and owner Joseph was beyond hospitable, what an awesome experience! This place cares about quality, presentation, and service.  We ordered small family combo and couldn't finish the food. Everything was so beautiful and little touches they added to the sushi and sashimi was a really nice touch and really elevated the experience. Our pallets were so pleased! Definitely recommend you to check it out and thank you Joseph for your hospitality=)"}
{"text":"I may get a little insulting with this one, so all you five star raters, clench your butt cheeks.  This place made me hate everything that sushi has become. A posh dining room with third rate service and food. For the first time in my life I sent a sushi roll back. They actually dared to serve a mango salmon roll with still green mango that was so unripe, i lacked the drape over the sushi roll.  There is so much wrong with this place that it made me question my taste for raw fish. In Vegas where good food is always a stones throw away, I recommending directing those stones towards this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa Wa Wa! Just love saying that! Saw full star avarge rating for this restaurant on yelp so I decided to go on an adventure with JC #2 to see if this place does live up to its 5 stars rating.  Walked in on a Saturday afternoon around 1 and this place was half full, mind you this place is relatively small so once it gets busy I can imagine a wait line. The hostess was super nice and placed us as one of those romantic booths with great privacy! Then shortly after the owner and the head chef, Joseph, came to greet us and introduced himself which I find very appreciated!  The menu has a large variety of choice, but since we were craving for some sushi and sashimi, we decided to go with a Small Sushi, Sashimi and Roll Tray/Boat. 35 pieces for $30 is very reasonable. Sushi wise, the different kind of fish are very fresh, however, the portion of the rice is a little too much on the Nigiri. The tray also has different variety of sushi and sashimi which I really appreciate as some other restaurants tend to give you the typical Salmon, Tuna, Snapper only. Joseph was also super nice giving us appetizers and dessert on the house!  When we were leaving, Joseph also was kind enough to walk us out! Talk about VIP treatment!  Overall,I would give this 5 stars, sushi and sashimi are decent and service is amazing! I will for sure be back for more!"}
{"text":"My first time here the atmosphere and staff are amazing.  The food is above average not your typical \"All you can Eat\" sushi Resturant.  Danny was very helpful suggesting specials that were not listed on the menu. The Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll was worth coming for. Ask for the Pink Scallops.  This place continues to impress us. The staff and fresh fish are always perfect."}
{"text":"Please,  this is the worst place I 've been to so far . The service was horrible , there was 1 guy running around like a hamster in a wheel doing everything . I came in with folks that ate and left and i was still waiting for my order to go , rainbow roll and a sashimi  combo ,40min really? I had a hungry husband and a baby waiting for me . The food quality was really below average , avocado on top was brownish , my edamame  was falling apart coz it was over cooked , fish was small and not so trusty so I microvawed  my salmon and gave tuna to my cat  . Never again !"}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience at Sushi Wa. I'm glad they stay open till 4. We came in around 2:30AM and were the only ones there. It was nice, but I hope they get busier during the late hours.   Our server was very nice and polite. She took our orders promptly and the sushi chef was very nice too, checking in on us.   We liked the salmon sashimi, I liked their ikura too. Their spider roll was one of the best ones we've tasted too.   The bikini and lava rolls were also ones that stuck out to us. They were pretty big portions.   For dessert we did strawberry mochi ice cream, pretty generic but good:-)  Would definitely come back for the ayce when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best sushi in town. They got fresh wasabi and the quality of the sushi is fantastic."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE lunch ($21.99) and had a nice experience. Quality friendly sushi chefs that seemed to care if I enjoyed my food. Great deal for the money and quality of food.  Pro-tip: Order some fresh wasabi (extra $2) and you will never want to go back to that pasty green crap ever again!"}
{"text":"We love coming here with family. The owner is very friendly and service is great. Love the small complimentary appetizers. Rolls are good too!"}
{"text":"Good AYCE menu!  Very nice selection for rolls and other menu items.....and it is close to home!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for the most part, nothing special to yelp about. Decor is semi modern and there are some intimate looking booths to sit in, but we were not even given that option for some reason. Service is very good and refills of drinks happened very frequently. Good rolls, but like I said nothing that really stands out. I had a order of UNI, but it wasn't really that tasty. It needs to have that fresh ocean taste that only true UNI fan will understand, mine had that unfavorable \"mediciney\" taste to it. I often order UNI at sushi places and it takes 10 to 15 minutes for it to come to the table for some unknown reason, maybe it's frozen and needs to be thawed out? Well the UNI at Sushi Wa came out right away, but tasted off.  The All you can eat price is a few dollars higher than all the rest, but then again it's not a huge negative, but just saying. I REALLY  don't like to hear loud obnoxios hip hop music when I am trying to have a decent dinner. I guess they are catering to the young crowd, but it would be cool to have some traditional Japanese lounge music playing softly in the background? I would actually trade loud conversation from diners than listen to loud music."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking to try out a new AYCE sushi place. Although Sushi Wa didn't have as high a rating on Yelp, my friend wanted to give it a try. There are so many sushi places on Eastern, almost too many options.   This place is adorable. It seems like a nice, high end sushi place. When we arrived there was basically no one in the place, but by about 20-30 minutes later and the place was pretty busy.  We both ordered AYCE and each started off with Baked Lasagna and Mussels. Mussels were pretty good but neither of us cared for the Baked Lasagna. I've had better at any other place I've been. There was a lot of cream cheese on top if that's your thing, I'm not that into it so I usually take half of it off. Regardless of that this roll doesn't compete with surrounding spots. There is definitely some kind of distinct, additional flavor being added and I'm not really into it. It wasn't bad, just not as good as other places I've been.   We also ordered the Fire Cracker ($6) and it really good. Equally as good as any other place I've ever had it. I highly recommend trying it. I don't think it's as spicy as it sounds, but there is definitely a kick to it. Popcorn Scallop was also pretty good. The sauces they served with it were ok.   Beef Teriyaki roll was ok. My friend liked it more than I did. I don't think I'm ready for a meat/sushi infusion yet.   Rose roll was pretty good, description says that it's a baked baby lobster on top of California roll with eel sauce. I'm not sure but that doesn't sound like what we got. It was a roll covered in a lot of stuff, I tasted scallops, there was definitely a really good creamy type sauce. This dish looked kind of messy, but as actually not that hard to eat. The only thing I didn't like about it was the red onion that was mixed on the top. They were pretty easy to remove but one snuck through on my last bite.   Screaming Orgasm was pretty good, but again I've had equal or better at other places.   My friend ordered the Las Vegas Roll, I didn't try it. 4 Kinds of fish, crabmeat, avocado all completely deep fried. It's not my thing. I don't mind some light tempura, but I'm more of a raw sushi kind of girl. I did try the sauce that was in the bowl because my friend didn't like how spicy it was. I usually like anything spicy, but this didn't have a great flavor.   So for my first visit here, I'd say it went ok. I mean I don't think I'll be rushing back here. I feel like I can get better value at any other place. The best thing about this place is the ambiance. Service was ok. Servers seems to be friendly, but also ambivalent. It's also one of the more expensive AYCE places that I've tried. I don't think that mixes too well with the level of deliciousness. Sushi quality seemed legit, but I also want quality flavor."}
{"text":"First all you can eat sushi place I found in Vegas that serves sashimi. Taste very good too!"}
{"text":"I judge all ayce sushi places on the caterpillar roll.  That being said...  The caterpillar roll was bland. There was no real taste of eel, from the actual eel or the eel sauce. I don't use wasabI and soy for this roll because I like the eel taste, but I did here.  The crunch scallop roll was generous. This was also on the bland side of the taste spectrum, but it's scallop so that's not surprising.  The spicy tuna roll was all heat and no flavor. This was disappointing.  The cucumber in the rolls was chewy. Cucumber is supposed to be crisp and crunchy.  The service is great though. My water glass was never empty and the server was always available for questions.  The pricing was fair for what I got and I left full, so that's good.  But I really was not a fan of the taste of the food.  It was an ok choice for a sushi lunch gamble on the other side of the world from where I usually am.  Would I come here again? Not likely."}
{"text":"wowwwwww! Its so delicious! We really loved so much and will be back for sure! Its so good quality of sushi! Top 5 in my life!"}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. I ordered 2 special rolls in the mini size: the eskimo (torched butterfish on top of dynamite roll) and the green eel (avocado wrapped eel roll). I didn't expect the size of the rolls to be so large! The proportion of rice-to-filling is perfect! They did NOT skimp out on the filling for these rolls. Although it took about 15 minutes to get our food (table of 6), it was well worth it! The plating is very pretty and most importantly, the food is delicious. The butterfish roll may be more fishy than what most people are use to if you aren't a sushi fanatic. However, I definitely recommend the green eel to everyone though!  The service is amazing. The waitress offered us complimentary ice cream (as I see with most of the other people have received as well), but it was a pleasant surprise to us. The chef (Joseph) came out personally to thank us for eating. Strangely he asked us for our names and wrote them down (assuming that we become regulars and he can call us by our names?). Either way, the service was great. I plan on coming back in the future possibly for takeout (there is a 10% discount!)."}
{"text":"Lemme start by saying:  If I could give this place a 3.5 I would. The fish was great for the all you can eat price. The environment was awesome, large alcohol range, and the menu is huge. The staff was also friendly. My first complaint is that you can't order half rolls until your last order. Personally, when I come to all you can eat sushi, I like ordering half rolls to have more variety. My main problem with my first and only visit here was that the staff, while they were very nice, they kept forgetting or messing things up. As someone with experience in food, I get mistakes happen. But after an incorrect drink, two plates that we didn't order, and our forgotten tempura ice cream, it got annoying. I would be open to visiting again for the food, but am open to finding another sushi joint."}
{"text":"2nd time here! I ordered the following: Sautéed scallops in butter, Fire cracker, Spicy garlic edamame, Pimp my roll, Masago nigiri, Miso soup, Red bean ice cream.  Fire cracker and the scallops were AMAZING! My family and I had 2 orders each of these appetizers YUM YUM!  Spicy garlic edamame is terrible, dry and ours looked wrinkly. Pimp my roll was okay. Masago was yummy. Miso was perfect. Red bean was good. So overall a decent sushi experience. Service was quite fast and my only complaints are that the special rolls don't seem very creative and the spicy garlic edamame is really bad. The appetizers are beyond fantastic and the nigiri is decent.  This is a pretty good place for sushi.  Will come again mainly for the fire cracker and scallops!"}
{"text":"WAAAAAA! pretty good. Upon hearing about this small Sushi bar in the Bathurst and Steeles area of the city I just had to try Sushi Wa. Korean owned Sushi Wa is serving up some classic Japanese dishes with some hints of Korean fusion here and there. For those trying to find the small restaurant, its got the smallest entrance beside the Me Va Me.  Upon entering in, you're greeted by the chefs behind the counter and waitress.  Depending on what time you arrive, wait times can vary as the place has limited seating/ booths, however we were lucky.   In terms of ambiance, the place is small, cute and cozy, however I feel they could definitely fit a few more tables and chairs to accommodate the dinner crowds.   For food both Jen and I kept decided to order their: **Wa 2 (for 2), selection of sushi; california & crab, nigiri, sashimi salmon, BC salmon, smoked, etc. Beautifully presented on a small wooden boat. This meal came included Salmon, Beef or Chicken Teriyaki,  vegetable/ yam tempura, edamame, and dessert (Green tea ice cream with frosted flakes).  **Cinderella,  torched sushi, cooked salmon, avocado, cucumber, crab meat wrapped with salmon on top. Deliciously presented, and as full as were, it was enjoyable.  IMPORTANT: Only improvement recommendation:  Lay out should be slightly changed to accommodate more guests as a few walked out due to long waits during dinner time."}
{"text":"Sushi is very delicious and fresh. Yum yum. Service was above and beyond. Aaron is funny and personable and very quick to deliver."}
{"text":"Loved the AYCE selections they have!  And the quality of the fish was superb!  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Extremely Unhygienic restaurant!! There was a dead COCKROACH in my dish!! The menu was nice and had a lot of choices. But the food was clearly not up to the mark. All the sushis that we ordered had a stale smell and look to it.. The salmon was clearly brown. I tried a piece and it was totally inedible. We ordered tempura and inside the plate there was a big dead cockroach! I was shocked and showed it to the lady who took our order. She would not believe us at all and would not apologize for this mistake. I was expecting a replacement for the plate but she would not even do that. After this I snuck  into the kitchen to check the hygiene level and it was disgusting. I saw about 4-5 cockroaches running around on the kitchen floor. I cannot believe that they can maintain such a poor hygiene level. I had to pay for all the dishes, yes even the cockroach one!! I have vowed to never come back here again. If you too do not want to get sick then I would recommend you to skip this place."}
{"text":"Came in today from nor Cal. Went in search of a place to eat from my hotel. Saw the sign for sushi next to another restaurant and a yogurt place. Decided I would try it.    Was very pleased with great service,  great sushi and some excellent green tea. I had spider roll, mango salmon roll and veggie tempura. The spider roll was one of the tastiest I have ever had. The crab was just perfect and fresh. So was the mango and salmon on the other.  Very fresh tasting. The vegetable tempura was also very fresh tasting and not overcooked or over fried.  If you like green tea,  try this one, you will be pleased. Best of service by waiter and sushi chef. I Would recommend this restaurant if you want fresh and tasty sushi.   They also had lots of other options for people that don't like sushi, including bento boxes, teriyaki and traditional Japanese.  If I lived here I would visit regularly. Keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"Visted here this weekend and was really disappointed. I and my friend have driven for a long time to try this 5star sushi restaurant. There are not many kinds of fishs and quality of fishs were not good, not too bad though. The size of portion was pretty big, but shape of sushi looked not professional. The service was not bad, slow.   This restaurant has not many seats for people and they can not control people even they are not so busy. The one thing that I liked this place was lots of parking lot.   If you are courious about this restaurant, just should go to all you can eat restaurant. Do not waste your time and believe other comments."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had. I wish I would've asked for my money back because I truly feel like I wasted it here. The sushi didn't taste fresh, even the mango on the mango salmon roll wasn't fresh. The service wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. I'm amazed that this place received 4 stars. Not surprised to see it slow on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Sorry to say the service was aweful from the chefs.   Waiter (nice guy) seated me,  and grabbed me a nice sapporo (yummi).  Then i sat for 10 mins with nothing from the chefs (By the way im at the bar seating). Usually, a hello, let me get u started, how can i help u.  Nope, nothing, just me n my sapporo while dude next to me was chowing down.  So i paid for my beer n left.   I used to come here n had my own chopsticks but now i know why i stopped.    To bad, its close to home."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. They have an all you can eat dinner for $26.95 that includes pretty much all the menu. Be sure to come hungry. Everything is great quality. The place is relatively big but reservations might be worth it for peak times."}
{"text":"I've gone to Sushi Wa several times now, since it's literally within the same business complex as my work. The big perk for me was the \"1/2 Off Lunch\" special, which had sushi (6-8 pieces) for anywhere from 2.50 to 5 bucks.  They no longer offer this, and the 'new' lunch specials are meh. I dont go to sushi places for california rolls. $9 for a few pieces of veggie tempura, chicken/beef teriyaki, and 4 cal rolls with a small salad.  The food itself is good, and service is nice.. But I usually planned to gorge myself on decent sushi for $10, not a cheapie bento.  Of note, they do have an 'all you can eat' for $21."}
{"text":"I have loved going to sushiwa ever since my mom had taken me there a few years ago. Service was prompt and the food was decent. Last night I went there with my boyfriend and felt sick towards the end of our meal. When we got home, I vomited and am still feeling unwell today (tender stomach, bad 'movements'...).   I called sushiwa and told them what I ate so that they could check their ingredients and to prevent this from happening to someone else, but a rude manager, who I believe is named Gio, told me that I could not have gotten food poisoning because the rolls we ordered had cooked fish. Even so, if the fish had not been handled or cooked properly, or if the other ingredients in the roll had gone bad, there are a number of factors could have contributed to my feeling sick.   Gio did not apologize for my sickness after eating at sushi wa. He was very short with me on the phone and did not say that he would check the ingredients from the rolls I ate.   I do not post this out of anger or for vengeance but because, terrible customer service and lack of empathy aside, it is unacceptable for a restaurant not to investigate such a complaint thoroughly. Indeed, all Gio had to do was apologize for my poor experience and promise that he would check the freshness of the ingredients and the handling and cooking of the food.   Needless to say, we will not be going back to sushi wa. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Everything is so yummy. Other than the male manager ready to have a stroke, making sure no one sharing the all you can eat, service is great!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I came here, I was really impresed with the innovative sushi combinations. However the last couple of times, I've came, the service has become  slower, the food is not as wonderful as the first couple of times I've been. It is AYCE sushi, which is awesome, however it can be a tad pricier than most AYCE joints. But if you're in the Henderson area and looking for good sushi to try without driving too far that is AYCE, this is probably the one to go with."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Not a lot of people know about Sushi Wa since it's tucked away at the Bathurst and Steeles plaza situated next to Me Va Me. The quality of sushi here is extremely high and their specialty rolls are astounding. Not only is the food fantastic but so is the service, especially Joseph who will make sure to greet all customers and remember their names. Joseph is one of the sweetest people and I truly love his personal touch service.   For starters, their taco yaki balls are scrumptious with a spicy kick. The complimentary crunchy soup is so good, you'll want to order a full portion.   I love their Crunch roll with df shrimp & tempura, avocado and chips on top. Their fish is very fresh. I also love their Eskimo roll with torched butterfish. So delicious!  The spicy salmon and tuna rolls are amazing. They are composed of chopped up fish with tempura and it's a flavour explosion in your mouth.  You can't go wrong with anything here as it's all delicious and very fresh."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. A large variety of special rolls. And the staff are extremely friendly. The sushi chef came around to personally greet us. Supa awesome wow"}
{"text":"When I rate sushi places I factor in food quality, customer service, atmosphere, and overall value. I have been here twice, both times I had excellent service, great food, and overall it was at the right price. Their baked rolls are excellent. Just a heads up, they use a good amount of mayo and other sauces in the baked rolls but they're delicious. Obviously I have been to better places, but these guys do a great job. I recommend them, its a great place to try out."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of AYCE sushi places in Vegas, and I have to say that this place is one of my top picks. They have a bunch of sushi rolls with ingredients I haven't really seen in other places and their modern, intimate decor adds a really nice touch to the experience.  My favorite rolls include the rose, bikini, dragon, fried salmon, and fried scallop. Rose roll is pretty good because it isn't too saucy and the combination of scallops and mushroom is really good! Bikini roll doesn't have any rice since it is wrapped with a cucumber shell which provides a refreshing and healthy alternative to the other rolls. Dragon is a favorite for those who like eel and eel sauce on top of a california roll. The fried salmon roll is delicious because it is basically a sushi roll stuffed inside crispy salmon. Fried scallop is good too, imagine popcorn scallop on top of california rolls.   Service is really good: the staff refills your drinks periodically without you having to call them over and they are very polite. I would definitely recommend checking this place if you are within the area. The price is comparable to other AYCE places even if this place seems a bit fancier (at least on the inside)!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is my favorite sushi restaurant! This is the only place I will come for sushi! The food is delicious, it's served in timely manner and the wait staff is friendly and courteous! We have brought here our three children with their spouses and numerous out of town visitors! Everybody has given it high remarks!  Definitely a five star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good price for the all you can eat.  Interesting sushi choices.  Had one that tastes like a whopper.  One was like lasagna.  Nice atmosphere.  Good customer service. Quick.  Correct.  Good suggestions from them.  Ill be back.  We did some damage here, they lost $$$ with us."}
{"text":"I really like Sushi wa.  The prices are pretty fantastic, and the quality of food is always top notch.  I am never disappointed when i come in for lunch or dinner.  The only issue I have with this place is that customer service is a little iffy.  The older woman there always seems angry and upset.  I really like the younger server.  She is really nice, but when the older woman is working with her, she tends to yell at the younger one and gets really awkward.  Other then that this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Finally ! A sushi place open until 4am !!! I don't know why but I'm always craving sushi or just hungry in general around 1am-3am so this is perfect  lol ! We sat @ the sushi bar area so it would be fast and easy, and the sushi chefs were so fun and entertaining ! The service was definitely amazing. I wish I got his name but he was soooo fast as he made everything right infront of us ! All the choices are so different when it came to the rolls but they were great ! The nigiris are AMAZING !!! We definitely took advantage of the \"all you can eat\" with this one !!! We got almost all the nigiris and tons of orders of them ! For late night sushi craving, this was AMAZING quality ! I can't wait to try more of the other rolls when I come back ! I got lucky to find this sushi place that's open until 4am but even luckier that their sushi is actually super yummy !!!  Definitely a MUST TRY !!"}
{"text":"Of course I had to save review #100 for Joseph! A+ Service. A+ Food.   Sushi Wa is great. This is my favourite sushi place in North York/Thornhill.  Seriously, this place has heart.   The rice is soft and fluffy, the fish is always fresh. Each piece of nigiri is delicately constructed, with its own unique and tasty twist, and melts in your mouth. The quality of each piece is consistent visit after visit.  We usually get the sushi + sashimi + roll combo for two, along with two other rolls because we want to try everything, but we are always so full after the combo it's a struggle to finish everything! At the beginning of this year, they expanded their menu to include some really crazy rolls. From what we've tried so far, they're pretty awesome.  The staff is always friendly, and they always try to be very attentive, even when there are a lot of people in the restaurant. At the end of the meal, the owner Joseph comes around every time to ask for your name, offer you free ice cream, and really tries to remember your name for next time. He's always so friendly and happy to see you.   Always a happy dining experience here!"}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi. Please note that it is only a la carte and no buffet style!! It is a small restaurant and extremely busy so either make reservations or go early. We saw several groups of people leave because they had to wait. A little on the pricey side.  However they give you soup, and delicious free appetizer. Service is good and fast. The owner walked us and opened the door for us asking us to return soon. Very nice gesture."}
{"text":"I really like having another all you can eat nearby. They have amazing salmon. The chef will be more than happy to give you recommendations. The Superman roll was my favorite. The chef was more than happy to create something for us too. Fast service. Never waited for my tea to be refilled. They even left us the pot. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped by this simple restaurant because we just happen to be in the area. It blew us away by the quality of the food and the service provided. The owner and sushi chef came to our table and talked to us, offered us free ice cream because he learned we were not from the area. This pleasant surprise was honestly the best quality for price point in the GTA. If you're in the Vaughan area/ Bathurst and Steeles area, please check this place out!"}
{"text":"Consistently one of the best sushi places in the Valley. Joon and his team provide high quality and creativity for a fair price and in a great setting. I eat there at least twice a week. Conveniently open till 3am every night. Their $28 all you can eat is the deal of the decade. Highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I just ordered from here for the first time and it was delivered within 40 min just as they said! I ordered a lot of the rolls in the \"mini\" form which is very reasonably priced and not exactly mini. The seaweed salad was amazing and was served with avocado! The sushi tasted just like if it was delivered to my table right from the kitchen.  I will definitely order from here again!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is a small and quiet and little sushi restaurant  located on Bathurst and Steeles.  I'd passed by this place many times and finally got to try it upon recommendation by my brother.    For starters, the service is exceptional; the waitress is very polite and during our first visit, provided us with a large photo album with picture of the dishes they served.  We even got some complimentary dishes and dessert on both visits!  Their complimentary rolls are unique; one was a mango radish roll, which was very refreshing and the other was a spicy roll of some sort.   The owner of the restaurant, a man by the name of Joseph Kim came out to speak with us and ask us about our meals.  He also asked us for our names and wrote them down.  We also got free ice cream after too.  After our meals, he thanked us and walked us out.  Grade A service right there!   Finally, the presentation of the food is amazing and instagram worthy, so do remember take pictures of your orders!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars no doubt!! As it was mentioned before the service was great and very fast too. Our waitress was very nice and brought us some complementary appetizers and ice cream for dessert. The sushi was very fresh and delicious, and I loved how they decorated the plates. They clearly put some work into it which you don't normally see at a sushi bar.  The prices are very reasonable too, I'd even say cheap considering the size of their rolls (huge!!). Joseph (the chef) came up to our table to ask how the food was and took our names, so he can remember us, if we decide to come back. I think that was very sweet) Overall it was a great experience and I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(237/365) \"New And Improved???\"  First off, it's more like 3.25 stars.....  Never did I think I was gonna step foot in this spot again...if you read my previous review, this was way back during the Yang Dynasty and was our first Yelptern's UYE where we were held captive....Ugh!  A former Goyemon employee suggested I come try this place out as they made some changes and things have gotten better and that they're still in the process of making things better...okay cool, so we arrive with an open mind into a comfy booth, go with AYCE ($26.95) and we order an assortment of things. Assorted nigiri, a few appetizers, hot items(dynamite, kalbi), a Pocky Roll, some sashimi one order per person, AYCE Dinner only,  also some uni and Amaebi which are also one order per person.  The atmosphere is cool and the fish quality and presentations are solid, and the apps were delicious. The only downside is that the sushi rice was totally bland and needs work. I'm glad we got to try Sushi Wa out again,  but they need to also offer half rolls, a few more side dishes,  and add flavor to the rice in order to compete with other AYCE Sushi spots around town.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \u  3.25"}
{"text":"My favorite locals sushi place in the city!  Joon is the best!     Am a little of a sushi purist, so I don't go in much for the rolls, but whether you're into rolls, sashimi or nigiri, the fish is always super fresh!  And, if you are a little adventurous, check the specials board--  fresh orange clam, sea urchin and kobe beef sashimi make frequent appearances...  and don't forget to ask for fresh wasabi.  It is a must have."}
{"text":"I'm totally disappointed! My husband and I go here to eat all the time, we left town for about a month and when we returned the first thing we wanted was sushi.  We noticed after we sat down that the menu and  prices had changed, and also the \"rules\" for AYCE. Then we waited 20 minutes for 2 rolls and a miso soup. (We were the only 2 people in the restaurant)So sad we really love the staff but the service and quality have left the building.  We've  gone back once since, hoping it was a fluke....... but unfortunately we had the same experience.  There are SO MANY OTHER CHOICES.  Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"A very nice place to stop by and have AYCE.  The fish here is always fresh and the portions are much better than other places in the area. The staff is very polite. The prices are a bit on the higher side but I believe it is worth it.  Not sure how other people were served but whenever we ordered straight sushi the portions were generous.  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I have been to 100's of sushi restaurants in the US and over sea's. I loved this sushi restaurant because of the service, atmosphere and amazing quality of sushi. Recommended adventure dish, ask for the sweet shrimp sushi and ask for the heads with it.  They batter the heads in tempura and are made to eat whole. I promise its amazing, and the taste is out of this world."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times over the years. The food itself is good and the decor and dining ambiance as well making it a good choice for group occasions. But the service is actually pretty terrible for a few reasons. First reason is they don't greet you in any sort of nice fashion. Then you sit there and wait quite a while for a person to give you water or menus. After they come, they walk away so fast and they don't come back. When they do come back for the order, they take a bit of time to make it. Then they don't come back for your next round of ordering. We know how they roll, so we just try to order all we want in the first time, rather than smaller rounds. But then we end up over ordering and becoming overstuffed. All you can eat sushi problems. I just wish they would get their service game together, because then we would definitely go here more. There are just better options with better food and better service around here. When I bring in people from out of town I would prefer to bring them here due to the seating and ambiance, but I just can't after past attempts. I brought my brother there from out of town with his wife and kids, and we ended up with a free voucher card with $15 on it because we were there for two hours and they knew the service was bad. I can't bring people here until I know it's fixed. Edited: I edited my review to remove the part about the ordering with paper and pens, I must have remembered that part wrong, we do have two sushi restaurants we used to go to with that same issue. But yes, I do know this is the proper restaurant and I do have the free voucher gift card somewhere that was given to my out of town brother when I brought him there with his family. This was a couple years ago, and we have been back a few times since. Its the size and shape of a credit card and If I can find it I will take a picture to prove it. One of the last times we went we were with another couple who had also been there before and we joked about the service as it unfolded again to be sub par. When we do go,  we know what to expect but we keep crossing fingers that it would have gotten better by now. It's definitely not a good business practice to respond how you do to patrons. Best advice is to learn something from what you are reading and make improvements. Not try to appear that everything is perfect and your patrons giving you feedback are crazy. This review is real, but the service is still a joke. We have been back a handful of times since, but not in the past 6 months. We will try it again when the time is right."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Vegas.  Joon, JJ, Yoon, and Yuly serve up the most diverse and extensive menu I've ever seen. From the mind-blowing Superman Burrito roll, to the mussels, to the white tuna sushi, you can't go wrong.  The servers and staff are super friendly and very attentive.  My wife and I love this place so much that I actually proposed to her here.  If you haven't tried sushi wa, then get in your car and get down here!  You won't regret it. They now have a late night menu that goes until 4am!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on the way to get some meat jun but, he changed his mind and wanted salmon skin handrolls... and obvi, Sushi Wa is our favorite for that. We were both excited as we haven't been back for a minute.   Initially, I was going to order just a bento box with one salmon skin handrolls but, BF convinced me to do AYCE.  We order about 6 (4 spicy for him, 2 regular for me) salmon skin handrolls; and since they don't do half orders, we went light on ordering too much.  So, 3 specialty rolls, hamachi kama, and gyoza to start.   I got my handrolls and they were just as good as I remembered.  Then got the specialty rolls SMOTHERED in mayo...ugh, I forgot they like to sauce up their rolls.   BF got his 4 salmon skin handrolls and they were double the size of mines...I thought they put a lot of jalapeño in there. Turns out they STUFFED the roll with rice! Like, really...That's their game of making you full.  I mean, I've seen other sushi spots do this but, this place used a ridic amount of rice.  BF ate about half the rice for each roll and they leftover rice coulda made 2 specialty rolls.    The waitress picked up his plate with all the rice and showed the sushi chef.  I didn't see but, my BF said they were pointing, looking, and talking about him.  So disappointing as we were excited for our lunch and this just kinda ruined the mood/day.  Thankfully, they didn't try to charge us for that rice but, that is most def our last time there.  The sushi itself isn't anything to miss anyways.  So with that: BYE SUSHI WA!"}
{"text":"Wa, wa, wa? Sushi Wa is my new favorite place. Let's start with the Ahi Poke salad which is better than anywhere. It is dressed with fresh small bites of fish, perfectly sliced seaweed, and the right amount of seasoning. I'm not a huge fan of Poke, but I'd return to get more here.  As the Mr. said, Sushi Wa's fish is super fresh. They cut nice thick pieces of Yellowtail. Their sashimi plates are creative and delicious too.   If this were my restaurant, I'd remove the TV from behind the chef station but, otherwise, the Asian decor takes me to another country, far away from the strip mall this restaurant actually resides in.  What turns this 4 into a 5 are the sushi chefs. They crack jokes, talk, offer special tastes. They're fun to be around."}
{"text":"I used to think Sushi Mon and Yama Sushi were the best spots in town. Then my friend recommended Sushi Wa. I was thoroughly impressed with the food and the extremely friendly staff. Our waitress Vanessa was absolutely a pleasure to speak too and shared her recommendations which were spot on for our liking and preferences. I am already looking forward to retturning to this Amazing establishment!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I came here with my husband as a treat to myself for dreadful month end accounting that I am about to endure.  It pains me to say that I did not truly enjoy this place; maybe I would have a year ago. A year ago, my sushi preferences had no standards, sauce me up and make it crispy.   When we arrived, we were kindly seated to a large booth for just the two of us. We for a moment felt like kings and the bar got set really high. Within a minute of sitting down, a young gentleman came and took our drink order. He got our drinks (me water with lemon and my husband an Asahi pint for $5). As soon as he came back with our drinks a minute or so later, he asked to take our order. We weren't ready and asked for 5 minutes to look over the menu. He said \"sure\" gave a wink and went on his way. My husband and I found him charming and we both exclaimed how much we thought he was going to be a good waiter.   Unfortunately, he did not come back. We had a female waiter who was nice as well who replaced him, it just kind of came out of nowhere.  The female waiter came to our table and we asked a couple questions to determine if we understood the rules correctly before getting AYCE for dinner. At that moment, we put in an order for 4 rolls and a white fish with ponzu sauce sashimi.  The rolls we got were: Mountain Roll, Pocky Roll, Bonsai Roll, Energy Roll. The rolls came out within a few minutes of ordering and we were ready to feast.    At a first glance, each roll looked good in appearance. They weren't particularly bite size and I found a roll to be more than my mouth could handle at one time. Additionally, the Pocky Roll should not be called a roll. It is really a mound of imitation crab meat with a few accents of fresh fish covered in avocado slices. This was good, but also not very \"fresh\" tasting even though it is on the \"fresh fish roll\" menu portion. I believe this item should be moved to the appetizer portion of the menu, because we were surprised when it arrived. My husband was not interested in this, so I struggled to eat it by myself.  Now my criticism for the other rolls, Mountain, Energy, and Bonsai is all the same. Each of these rolls were over sauced. We love sauce, so when we say over sauced, we mean over sauced. Out of all the rolls, the Bonsai was our favorite because it tasted the freshest and most balanced. However, it was not good enough for a return visit. The sashimi was the best part of our meal thus far.  So we finish our first order, and we are waiting for the waitress to come back by. I had been out of water for a while now and we hadn't seen our waiter since being served.  Thankfully, there was cross fit silliness being shown on TV to distract me from my empty water glass and dry mouth. Meanwhile, waiters were helping out families at other tables and refilling their cups.   By the time she came back, we were kind of ready to give up. I asked for a miso soup, and we also order ice cream deserts. Weirdly enough chocolate sauce came on our ice cream (strawberry mocha and green tea ice cream) and I never received the miso soup .I didn't bother to correct the wait staff because I was ready to leave.   Oh yeah, for whatever reason, the central table in the restaurant was being used a busing station. It was collecting dirty plates and it had the water pitches waiters were filling patron's glasses with.  Overall, if Taco Bell is good Mexican food to you, then you will think this is good sushi. Otherwise, it is what it is. This is the most expensive sushi place I have been to that provides this quality of food. I do not see myself returning for a visit until I hear about positive changes in the quality of food and improvement with wait staff tending to guests.  I apologize if the review seems harsh, but I hope that it makes a positive impact on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi been here twice now. The service is good. The appetizers are good. The price is comparable to most AYCE sushi places. They have a good beer and saki selection. The sushi chef pays attention and is attentive to the customers at the Bar. The staff seems very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love their AYCE but what sets it apart is also their cooked items are extensive and yummy.  I could eat their salmon collar all day long!  The fish is fresh and I love that they have a half price AYCE price for kids.  I love Goyemon also (esp. Bc they have half rolls) but I'm not paying $27 for my 4 year old!  Now if only I could get half rolls here......"}
{"text":"Good sushi i've tried hawaiian roll. All are deliciuos. There's a lot of selection and wuality of taste. Affordable."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa was wonderful. I had to go back the next day just to ensure that it was as great as the day prior."}
{"text":"I was craving for sushi recently and got bored to head to Yonge street where I usually dine. So glad to find this petit but delicious sushi restaurant which is more convenient for me. The restaurant holds 7 or 8 tables, including 3 booths by the windows. The ambience is neat and comfortable.  I ordered take-out. During the waiting, the staff brought us a complimentary appetizer. When our dishes were ready. The owner (I guessed) himself delivered the package to us, asked our names and thanked for our visit. We felt touched with such a warm and sincere welcome.  About the food, I think it was worth for the price. The presentation was nice even though it was a take-out. I tried the special roll set lunch of lionking plus crabmeat. The portion was quite adequate and fresh. As for the tempura lunch bento, the chef was very thoughtful to cut two small slices on the container to let the steam out and presumed the crunch of fried food.  I saw some popular dishes on the menu like salmon chirashi, sushi rolls. As well, some special dishes, such as aburi sushi (torched sushi). Will definitely try next time."}
{"text":"Food/server, very good.   Management- the worst.   Visited with family in from out of country- a group of 10, one elderly. 4 of us ordered AYCA. Because of this, they asked that we move seats, abuelita was uncomfortable moving seats at the triangle shaped table so they watched us like hawks to ensure we weren't sharing between a la carte and AYCA. At one point, the manager got loud, waived his finger at my kid yelling, \"you cannot share!\"  He was wrong- they were sticking to the \"rules\" and sharing between a la carte orders. I had an exchange with him and for the rest of the meal he sent his largest statured busser to circle our table.  It's a shame. Chefs are excellent, server was fantastic and visibly uncomfortable with her manager.  ...we're not returning."}
{"text":"Amazing as always!!! Service and food so good. Totally worth the money for the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to bring a group of friends for sushi and a few drinks. They have an exceptional selection of premium Japanese beer and sake. Rolls are decent but very filling. If you're doing the all you can eat, be sure to pace yourself. I like that the appetizers and desserts are also included, but again there are a lot of fillers so choose wisely."}
{"text":"Some of the best bang for your buck on AYCE. Some things are limited to one and you will see why. Serious chunks of fish, big servings, tasty sauces. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"The place is a bit hidden.  Not really in a popular plaza.  However, the decor inside is nice.  They do have happy hour specials in the afternoon, and I think they just started doing two for one drinks at night specials.  They also have a DJ playing now on certain days.  I guess they're trying any gimick to get people to come, but what might work more is spending money on advertising than on a DJ.  The sushi does taste fresh though, and service is great.  This isn't really cheap food, but what type of sushi is unless it's prepackaged in some grocery market which isn't something I like."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after seeing the 4 stars on Yelp, I was definitely more disappointed than impressed. Two big things that made me take stars.   1. The food was decent but their sashimi selection is very small and very limited. Their sushi selection, rolls, and hot foods were good but nothing \"wowed\" me.  2. Every single time our server would come to take our order (we were 4 people doing AYCE) she would ALWAYS have to comment about how much food we were ordering and if we were 100% sure we wanted what we just ordered. This made no sense to us because we were well aware that there can be charges for left over food. This honestly ruined the mood and the food which is why I took an additional star from my review."}
{"text":"Upscale feel to the decor. We went in today and we were the only patrons, but that's probably because it's been raining all day. The staff was very friendly and the food was amazing! This is now one of my favorite sushi places. We had the pocky roll, the rose roll, the superman burrito, baked green mussels, monkey brain, and the energy roll. They were all to die for. We wanted to try more things but just didn't have enough room. Didn't even have room for dessert. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with 3 kids. Fresh fish, attentive service and reasonably priced. Kids really liked the chicken teriyaki which they tend to be picky about.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect :) the sushis are fresh and delicious plus the portions compare to the reasonable price are great. Josef, I guess the owner, welcomed us with three different dishes on the house"}
{"text":"The perfect example of what customer service should be. Their food is amazing and their all you can eat pricing is amazing! Their ambience in there is great and their lighting is comfortable even on those, \"I drank too much the night before\"  days. The sushi is so fresh and their spicy rolls are killer.  I have referred so many people to this place and I recommend it to anyone looking for great service and amazing rolls!"}
{"text":"2 stars mainly just for the food (presentation and taste) other than that the customer service was horrible from the time we called to check the hours till the time we payed the bill and walked out. There are way better all you can eat sushi places (sushimon, Sakana) unfortunately this was the only place open till 4am, as we get off of work late at night and needed to get our sushi fix on. Our waitress (I think her name was Jenny)? Was super rude, didn't seem to give a hoot about us, and we cringed to order or ask her any questions about the menu without getting talked to like we were stupid or get some kind of attitude from her. Really didn't want to even tip 10% but I could never do that even as horrible as it was. We tipped 18%, thinking maybe she was just having a horrible night, or maybe the customer service field isn't the right choice of profession. Although we never will be coming back again, we'll still give it the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I would really love to give this place more stars because the food is good but the service is HORRIBLE!  They sat us and then took all more 15 mins before some came over brought us menus and took our drink order.  It took forever to get the waitess to come over and take our order.  I order the simplest rolls out of the whole table and did not recieve my rolls till everyone had recieve their rolls and were finished eating.  This isn't the first time I have been here, I gave another chance and both times the service was awful.  They need to hire more staff.  Don't go here if your in a rush because even lunch took us over 2 hours."}
{"text":"Sushi is great. No complaints there! But 1 waitress has made us not come back. We end up getting her EVERYTIME. Her attitude is terrible and she gets mad when ever you want to order something else. It's all you can eat, I'm going to eat as much as I can. Not kidding, you can see her disgust on her face when my friends and i come in to eat. Idk what we did, but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi experience! Wonderful sushi chefs who will make anything for you! And I mean anything! Attentive and friendly staff, excellent decor and interior design.   Will definitely return! The sashimi is excellent!"}
{"text":"Oishii desu yo!  Man, I wish I had tried this place long ago.  Why have I avoided Sushi Wa in the past?  Mostly because their menu used to be pretty pricey and it looked too upscale to take my two rambunctious rug rats to.  Unfortunately, that relegated me to eating at too many sushi bars that wouldn't know a fresh fish even if it was thrashing on a cutting board.    But along came my chance when some clients thought it'd be a good idea to try this joint.  Upon arriving, there were comments about how nice the place looked.  In fact, the place looked like it didn't quite belong in a strip mall tucked next to U-Swirl (no offense to U).    Sitting down, everyone chose to do AYCE, which meant I had to suppress the desire to order everything on the menu (and to order 10 scoops of ice cream).  Yes.  I am a pig.  When it was time to order, I probably should not have been the one to do so.  Here's the rundown of what I can remember:  Oyster Shooters - suckas was HUGE!  Best to shoot the sake and quail egg, then pick out the oyster.  Raw Oysters (3 per order) - too big for me, but good flavor.  Soft Shell Crab - I love it that you don't have to have it with rice.  Nigiri sushi was impressive for the way the fish drapes over the rice and the quality of the hamachi in particular was notable.  Mexican Roll - This was so not my cup of tea.  It's like they took the leftover spicy tuna and mixed it with a bunch of crap.    Deserts were AYCE, which, if left unattended, I would have shut this place down.  Lucky for them I was with clients and didn't get crazy.  I actually ordered one of each of the 6 or 7 flavors of mochi ice cream, but I changed my order to two scoops of green tea ice cream and the banana tempura.  For better or worse I didn't order sake...this was supposed to be business meeting, after all.  But I did check out their alcohol list to see what I was missing and they actually have some really good sake on there.  Try the Wakatake or Kurosawa black - good stuff you don't find in most local sushi restos.    Why have I avoided Sushi Wa in the past?  I don't know!  They have it all, ambiance, fresh fish, good sake and all the desert your tummy can handle.  Check this joint out at www.bomb.com."}
{"text":"Me and my best friend come to this place the most for our sushi craving for this very reason: Best quality of fish with the most affordable price.  I always start out with a seaweed salad- their portion size on this one is small but it's not a big deal because you get so much food later on that it's a great starter.  Then I pack on nigiri, everything from big belly tuna to seared pepper to yellowtail and salmon. Their fish quality versus some cheaper joints like Blue Fin & Daisho knock them out of the water and give the most bang for your buck if you're a fish lover like me. And for these, they don't scrap you on portion- I could barely fit the whole piece in my mouth. Still did and it freaking MELTED with flavour.  My friend ordered Shrimp Killer- good for people looking for a lighter choice. It didn't come with much eel sauce but when we ordered a second one with extra it was overkill so just compensate with soy or something.  I ordered a Salmon Crunch- much more on the heavier side which is why it only came with six pieces because one piece feels like an entire roll. But very cooked and comes with two sauces on the side to dip them in.  We picked off the rest of my friends scallop crunch roll when the manager Gio (who'd been serving us all night as well) came up to check our IDs for some complimentary drinks for being such frequent customers. This really made up for the off putting vibe we got from the female server who silently got our menus and took our plates with frozen ice on her face.   Nonetheless he really made us feel welcome by remembering us and appreciating our feedback on social media. I got to sample a light peach sparkling sake while my friend got a raspberry sake straight. I would've enjoyed more of it if I weren't driving but it was a great cap to a great meal next to the always amazing banana tempura that is a must for leaving room for!  Beyond satisfied for this trip, already looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"No worth my time to give a lengthy review of Sushi Wa. Food was ok, service was terrible!"}
{"text":"One word: Excellent!! :oP Try all these during lunch $21/$22per person, all-u-can eat:  Appetizer: Seaweed salad, Monkey Brains, Miso Soup, Galbi Korean Ribs, & Soft Shell Crab. Sushi: Uniagi Nigiri, Salmon Nigiri, Yellowtail Nigiri, & Garlic Tuna! Rolls: Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, Sex on the Beach, Salmon Skin Roll, & Mango Salmon Roll. Dessert: Tempura Banana Vanilla Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Small restaurant BUT excellent service.  It's just like a neighbourhood restaurant.  Owner will try his best (when he is available) to greet every single customer.  He is very kind and nice.  Staff are friendly and very helpful.   Their sashimi is very fresh.  Love their sushi / sashimi / roll combo, with pretty presentation.  Also love their dinner bento: good price, great quality, big portion.  Their tempura coating is perfectly thin, love it too~  This restaurant is getting busier, so it's better to make reservation."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of sushi/sashimi in my life time and I have never really been to a place where EVERYTHING tasted amazing.  Sushi Wa has met all my expectations..! FINALLY!   Not only was everything fresh and delicious, IT WAS ALL YOU CAN FREAKIN' EAT.   YES. I believe it was about $26 for dinner...my party and I probably ate over $700 worth of fish...like to the point where I started feeling BAD that I practically ate the whole entire ocean...but in a cruel sort of good way...my bad Ariel XD  Food aside, the restaurant itself is very, very nice. It's dark but sophisticated and feels very fancy. Their presentation is impeccable as well. They make sure every slice of sashimi is placed perfectly and that every plate is fresh and clean. The waiters are exceptionally kind and so are the sushimen. They carved up A LOT of fish for us that night. KUDOS!   All in all, if you're near Henderson or Vegas and looking for some legit sushi/sashimi, hit this place up. No regrets. I promise! :]"}
{"text":"Best Ayce sushi I've been to in a while. Great service, very polite staff. Food was very good quality.  Will definitely come back to again."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot.. I'd say this is comparable with I love sushi due to Sushi WA has all you can eat.. The sushi is just as good.. They also have very nice staff. My waitress is very kind and Funny.. Have to check this spot out.. I'd recommend the xxx roll."}
{"text":"I'm sad for 3 reasons.  1. Sushi Wa is a far drive from my residency and from work.  But because my friends raved about this place, I really wanted to take the time and drive to try it.  2. My favorite kind of sushi which is the simple Salmon Sake Nigiri was laid on top of a super huge portion of rice and more importantly, the fish was NOT fresh.  HUGE disappointment!  3. My favorite roll which is the spicy tuna over crispy fried rice here was bland!  The fish looked like it has been out for days and they don't use fresh jalapeno?  Makes no sense.  I was a bit disgusted.  I also had their Yellowtail Nigiri; also not fresh.  I tried their garlic edamame; no taste and not even a hint of garlic.  When you say there is going to be garlic in a dish, I better taste it.  It's as if they like they completey forgot the ingredient and it's in the freakin' name.  Boo!  Then, I had their Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll...and THUN THUN THUN.....again, no taste of any garlic.  The roll even sits on a bowl of soup that only makes it even worse because the soup base doesn't taste like anything but yuck.  I couldn't believe my dismay!  The one star goes to one appetizer: Fried Oysters, and one roll: Volcano roll.  The volcano roll was a little too much on the saucy side that if I had to finish it myself, I would feel guilty for my because of all the mayo clogging up my heart valves.  But because it had sauce, it was the only roll that had any flavor.  This was a huge disappointment.  Not only the taste, but the fish wasn't fresh.  Fresh comes first!  The wait  staff though was really nice, and the place is decorated nicely; kind of too fancy though.  Also, they over do the food presentation.  They need to work on the food taste rather than the presentation.  Just because something looks good, does not mean it tastes good.     I'll end on a positive note though.  They do have coffee mochi for dessert.  Not many AYCE sushi places have this mochi flavor.     If my friends convince me to go back to try their orders, I don't know.  Because the fish might still be from today."}
{"text":"All you can eat was unbelievable and the price for it is the best in town. Favorite roll was the 4 of a kind; and don't be afraid to try something new. They have a wide variety of things to choose from and this is honestly 1 of the best sushi spots in town"}
{"text":"Fresh wasabi never had it before got it here I love it I was digging into that little dish between all the sushi I thought about ordering more for desert  Sushi was better than most a lot of interesting rolls can't remember any names.  The one I liked the best reminded me of a baked green mussel.  A roll topped and baked like a green mussel.  The second best thing there other than the real wasabi was the interesting appetizers. Monkey brains a mushroom stuffed with spicy tuna then fried then a crab shrimp and cream cheese fritter thing killer green mussel a few others that slip my mind  ohh and fresh wasabi"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The fish was delicious. You really can taste the difference from other sushi joints. Roy was my chef, he was fantastic! I had the Ultimate Salmon Roll, Garlic Tuna, Phillie Roll, and the Pimp My Roll. Everything was wonderful, especially the garlic tuna. I've never had fish that tasted so fresh and just melted in my mouth. I found the Pimp My Roll to be too spicy for myself, but the flavors were good. I will definitely be going back for more!!"}
{"text":"Had take out here before, but the service dinning in was excellent. We were seated immediately, and were provided with snacks & icecream (at the end of the meal) on the house.   Ordered the SSC-1 (35 pcs) priced at $29.95 before tax which was standard price. The sashimi was very fresh and cut generously (not thin and dry like other establishments)-- it was presented beautifully. As everyone else had mentioned, the chef came out to introduce himself as Joseph and asked us for our names as well as feedback on his restaurant. Must say, it is very rare for business owners to do that these days, but it made us feel valued as customers.   I think I've just found my favourite go-to sushi joint at this hidden gem. 5 stars because I left happy with the entire experience as he walked us out. Gave extra tips for this mom & pop shop!"}
{"text":"Been here a lot of times but this last time, really bad service and overwhelming rice underneath a thin layer of fish. Couple years ago, this was my go-to sushi place but now, wont be coming back. The screaming orgasm and the amaebi nigiri was still really good but all the other nigiris were all very thinly sliced over an overly large portion of rice. It seems as if I'm just eating a big chunk of rice. Couldnt even tell if there was fish on top.   The biggest factor of this one star review is really the service. I'm not sure if it was just our server or just generally speaking. But, it was terrible. On the get go, once we said our first batch of orders, he just questioned us if we would be able to finish all those cause they charge for leftovers, etc. Now, we've been eating AYCE sushi for the longest time and we already know what our limits are. But making that statement seems more like an insult rather than a reminder. Then he kept asking the same question after every order. Now we felt like we were challenged.. so we had like 4 batches of a ton load of orders that we finished (no leftovers). With those statements and questions, we felt totally uncomfortable throughout our dinner which just ruined the whole night. Towards the end of our dinner, we kinda had the attitude of anger and sarcasm not just towards our server, but with the whole restaurant as well. Btw, server's name is Mark."}
{"text":"When I moved to Las Vegas, Sushi Wa was the first place I had sushi. That was years ago, before they changed over to an AYCE format. My husband is not a sushi eater and Sushi Wa was always a place we could go together for dinner because they serve teriyaki chicken bento boxes all day.   Fast forward a few years... My mother was in town with her boyfriend visiting and wanted to go out for dinner. My husband suggested Sushi Wa. I was a little concerned, I had read about the less-then-amazing experience some Yelpers had at a recent UYE. Since our group was fairly small, we decided to risk it...   The hostess allowed us to select where we wanted to sit and brought out both the AYCE and regular menus. We decided pretty quickly that AYCE wasn't going to be worth the money (it is $26.95 per person, and they limit sashimi to one order per person) since we weren't super hungry.   The three of us split a Philadelphia roll, a spicy tuna salad, and the sashimi combo (4 pieces each of tuna, salmon and yellowtail). My husband had the bento box and we all split an order of edamame as well as two bottles of nigori sake. The sashimi was sliced nice and thick, and I love that Sushi Wa makes their Philly roll with asparagus, gives it a nice yummy crunch.   Total damage with tip was $100. This isn't too bad for dinner and drinks for 4 people, but we really did not have that much food. The decor is very nice and service was decent, we had multiple people check on us throughout the night and never waited long for anything other then the bento box which was understandable.  Will I be back? Maybe someday. There are a LOT of other sushi options in the area though..."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite sushi place. Such Quality and detailed service. The Sushi is amazing. They also just started staying open for late night sushi. (I believe until 4 am) which is wonderful for us late nighters!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable service and food. Believe the reviews, don't hesitate just go. Best place I have been to. Joseph the owner is a gem."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa a couple months ago was just another sushi spot for my girlfriend & I to try, but now it has become the ONLY sushi restaurant we attend. Three things blow it away from every other sushi spot; 1. The food 2. The cleanliness 3. The friendly staff. The entrees that are available to eat with AYCE are delicious along with the fresh, mouth watering sushi! The tuna sashimi just melts in your mouth! Also, every time you walk in, and once seated you are in awe of how consistently clean the restaurant is. Dirty dishes never stay on your table for long at all! Lastly, but not least the staff here is always greeting you with a smile from beginning to end! Their priority is making your lunch/dinner a meal to remember, and eventually return to dine on the amazing delectable food! SUSHI WA IS THE PLACE TO BE PEOPLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the the all you can eat lunch and wasn't that impressed. Most of the rolls on the menu had nothing but crab - no shrimp options. Overall food was good and nice place."}
{"text":"Love that this place is opened late :) friend and I (who is visiting) had a late night craving of sushi. Place is very nice/clean. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I had the crunchy roll very good! The eel sauce was very good too. Defiantly gong back :)"}
{"text":"Perfect place. My server was very nice and kind. I love this place!!! If you want the best sushi come here! They are open till 4AM!"}
{"text":"I haven't gone out with my wife in awhile and we wanted to go somewhere close to the house that had Ayce so we came to Sushi Wa. After we got seated it took them 10minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink then after we got our drinks as we were about to order the Asian lady said hold on and she turned her back on us and grabbed something from another table then when we were ordering she said hold on I'll be back in the middle of ordering our food. Was trying to figure out where she went as she was gone for 3or so minutes, I seen her taking dirty dishes from another table so we waited for a few minutes. She never attended to us so we decided to take off, horrible service and it wasn't even jammed packed. I wanted to try the sushi there but o well maybe not meant to be maybe it was a sign but even it was I still give it a 1 star because customer service should be #1"}
{"text":"I've been going to sushiwa for years, it is hands down some of the best sushi in town. I know this sounds sooo generic, but the fish is fresh to death. And their AYCE comes with SASHIMI. Pro tip order the screaming orgasm sashimi and use the broth as a dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I have been eating  here since it opened and speak with the owner frequently.  The staff has always been good, and they cater to make certain my wife and boys enjoy their dining experience.   I enjoy their specialty rolls, and especially the Superman burrito roll and 911 roll for those that love avocado. Very good sashimi with great tuna.  Try the Baha for nice yellowtail with jalapeño, if you like a little spice.  The 911 sauce is a must for spice. The tuna poke is also very good. It can get busy, but generally service is very good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"first time here!!! Great service and they're really friendly and love this place and cant wait to be back soon!! ."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, can't wait to dig in!! This is the perfect spot for special occasions or just a casual night out. Kid and family friendly! Just awesome!"}
{"text":"We want to eat some Japanese food over the weekend and search nearby and found this location.  We decided to give it a try.  The restaurant is very small with limited seating.  Luckily we are there early and able to get a seat.  We order 3 mini rolls (torch salmon, soft shell crab and spicy salmon) and a chirashi dinner.  The portion is decent and food is fresh.  After our dinner, both waiter and waitress came and ask us if we want to pay the bill now.  Maybe the restaurant seating is limited and they want us to leave asap once we are done.  While we are eating, we saw the chef came out to greet the customers.  He didn't even get a chance to come by and we left.  The chef Joesph came outside of the restaurant and ran to us and had a few chat.  I was surprised he came out.  He felt bad that we left before he can come to talk to us and was offering us ice cream next time we come back for dinner.  We will come again with the quality of food and he takes the effort to run outside of the restaurant to talk to us."}
{"text":"The worst!! Buyer beware!  DO NOT GET ALL YOU CAN EAT!! Service is terrible, food sucks!  Took my family there and they watch you like a hawk to see if you share.  Made us feel very uncomfortable!  Really!!i would not feed my dog the food.  DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"This place always delivers. From the moment you walk to the food you eat, the feeling at this sushi bar is as if they were waiting for you all day. The staff is very welcoming and warm the food is very delicious and the fish is just the right temperature."}
{"text":"I love AYCE sushi so I came to check out their sushi. The nigiri was amazing and the restaurant decor was really nice. There was only one problem. I love AYCE sushi because I love ordering A LOT all at once and I come hungry. Throughout my meal, I was reminded over and over again that I had to finish everything to avoid getting charged extra. This was a total buzzkill. I understand the server was probably trying to help me by informing me, but after the 1st time was plenty enough. Food was great, customer service was not."}
{"text":"This place is on point!!! Geo was serving us and was amazing. Service, fish, and atmosphere were perfect! This reminds us that the bigger names are just fads and that we need to be supporting a crew like this. Recommend strongly if your in the area and would drive there over other sushi places any day! Mahalo to Geo and the Crew!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is great if your looking for something quick and a la carte.   Pros:  - the head chef, Joseph, is always so kind to us whenever we come. He comes and greets our table, asks for our names and tries to remember them each time we come. He really is a sweetheart.  - the servers: all of the ones I've encountered are very sweet and take our order fast - appetizers: instead of the typical miso soup, you get a vermicelli noodle soup which I like - sushi: sushi is alright (7/10) for me but pretty good. Favourite rolls includes the Green Dragon and the Smoked Philadelphia Roll  - tempura: tempura is always so crispy and fresh. Love the yam one personally   Cons:  - store: the store is a little older and could use some renovations.   I will be coming back. Great service and team at sushi wa. I really recommend going if your looking on filling that sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The best sushi place in town. I usually come here 2 a month, and have always been satisfied with the food. And the fact that they give you a good small alcoholic drink. And they offer salmon belly which I absolutly love eating."}
{"text":"Still have the slowest service in town. They finally got nice servers crew but the cooks still need help. Usually you get your first orders pretty quick. When they magically stop working on your orders. And when they finally resume (let's say 50min after placing the order), food comes out as a mess (your \"baked\" roll is cold in the middle, for example). Be ready to spend an hour more here than you spend in other AYCE places... No more sushi Wa for us sadly"}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Fresh sushi, delicious -chef puts extra seasoning on the netas and it really shows. Chef named Joseph does table checks and just goes the extra mile with everything"}
{"text":"this was our first and last time coming here.    we had 2 servers.  the first one (tall/skinny) was nice.  the second server was shorter and NOT NICE.    i let the 2nd server know that our sprite tasted more like soda water and she said it was sprite (basically saying i was wrong) i asked for a coke instead of arguing with her about the taste.   the 1st server was nice enough to say they had to change the bag on the sprite.    we got 1 tiny serving of ginger (like 3 slivers of ginger) / wasabi for the 2 of us.  we asked the 2nd server for more ginger.  she never brought it.  we asked the 1st server for more ginger (since the 2nd one didnt bring it) - she brought it.    then they changed servers and didnt tell us so we waited forever to place another all you can eat round.    after the 1st server let us know they changed up, we decided to just order dessert and be done with the place.    1st server convinced me to get 1 banana tempura and 2 different scoops for ice cream instead of 2 banana tempura (since they use an entire banana).  ok, cool...sounds amazing.  2nd server drops of 1 banana tempura with 1 scoop of ice cream.  1st server comes back after the dessert is eaten. i let her know we didnt get what she suggested and the 2nd server didnt seem to care, come back or ask us about it.    then the owner drops off the check and asks if its ready to be picked up.  sure....   hey, thanks for asking new customers how their experience was. it was kinda crappy!      SIN CITY SUSHI - sit at the bar.  better service. better sushi. better experience."}
{"text":"Good sushi, however last time I was there I had a very unsavory experience. The sushi bar was full so my parents and I sat at a booth. I ordered All You Can Eat, and my parents ordered a la cart. When my food was delivered the manager set mine down on the opposite side of the table and said if I wanted to eat I would have to move so that he could see if I was \"sharing\". I HADEN'T EVEN TAKEN A BITE! I told him that I was happy where I was and that I would not move. He argued with me and I told him that I was a very good patron and that my family owned a business in the same complex and that I have been a regular and that I didn't appreciate being treated like a criminal. He huffed and puffed then left. Another waiter who overheard came over and apologized saying that the manager was awful and a 'dick'. I had to agree. The owner was not there that day and apparently the manager got a big head with the little responsibility. He continued to circle my table, watching me like a hawk while I finished my food. While the food was great, I couldn't enjoy it. And honestly, if I hand't been so hungry I would have gotten up and left in the beginning. My dad was fuming and disgusted and the manager. After years of going there, we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! great food (the AYCE is among the cheapest you'll find) friendly service and I love the environment..DEF check it out!  *the honey bread is so simple yet so delicious, very good dessert"}
{"text":"Been here 6 times.  All you can eat is worth it. The superman burrito is a must have. Even if I'm full, I still gotta have it. The Uni is hit or miss. I guess depends on the season or their supplier."}
{"text":"... Where to start... I first tried sushi wa based on some awesome reviews I read and really wanted to find a place in Henderson that can be my Togo place... Well when I arrived I was immediately told to try the tuna because it was fresh well this was sad because it was far from fresh so I began to try things that they didn't recommend and I ended up having a good meal the freshest fish that day was the super white tuna.. So I only killed 2 baby cockroaches on the sushi bar table that day and despite the not so fresh fish I decided to go again and take a friend the next week... Because I liked their dynamite and mussles  We had a sushi chef named waldo .. Waldo seemed to have a bad attitude and didn't like the fact that we Ordered a lot of food in fact one order he doubled the portion saying we ordered two orders instead of one which I know I wouldn't have ordered two orders ... Also I found out that they charge you if you order fresh wasabi I had it last time I was there and when I ordered it today they said there would be a charge come to find out I was charged for it last time but was not told so watch out ...  Now to the worse part of this meal there... I ordered the super white tuna and ate the first piece quickly I swallowed everything when I should have spit it out.... The fish was rank and bad and didn't even smell right I pointed this out to Waldo who smelled it and told me there was nothing wrong with it ... I asked his sushi chef friend to smell it himself and that guy said it was bad and apologized....   It's now Monday evening and I'm finally over the terrible bout of food poisoning That overtook me for the past 3 days since .. I'm finally eating solid foods rather then chicken broth and burnt toast... I never ever want this to happen again ... I believe that sushi wa does not keep fresh fish or quality control as I've read a lot more reviews about their quality issues.. Needless to say I will never eat here again nor will I recommend you eat here either I will also tell everyone I know about my ailment and 3 days of bed rest acquired from their poor quality control performance"}
{"text":"My first visit to Sushi Wa was yesterday and the first thing I noticed when I walked in was the raw fish smell. I figured that could be normal for a sushi place?  We ordered the salmon scallop roll, philadelphia roll, and monkey brain (which was my favorite, mushroom, cream cheese and salmon).   I was suprised that although it was Weds there was no one else in the place. The decor is nice but they don't serve vodka, just wine and beer.   Would definitely return for more monkey brain!!"}
{"text":"Awww man!!  This has been my favorite sushi joint for a year-ish!  The Japanese Lasagne is to die for.  We got the all you can eat sushi and was ignored the whole time we were there.  It was taking 20 minutes in between each order. WHA???  It wasn't even busy. The waitress was evil, she was rude and I swear she shit in my food because after I left I was sick!  I was so nice to her and tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, she had helped me two times before and it was the same story. So now, here I am venting my experience here.  WA, ditch that waitress, she's tainting your business. The runners were delightful and very sweet.   Really sucks, I would gleam over Sushi Wa but after this visit, I won't be going again :("}
{"text":"I will keep coming back again and again! I love this place. I recommend that you try it as well. AYCE included one order of sashimi, which most places don't do anymore. All of the rolls are fresh and the presentation is impressive. I usually order Tuna sashimi to start which is always good here, but my favorite rolls are bikini, hawaiin, mango salmon roll. I finish off with Unagi Nigiri because the sweet eel sauce tastes more like a desert to me. Sushi Wa is also on the Uber Eats list and they give you a 10% coupon for your next in restaurant visit. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat ever! So much variety and options to choose from. Service was fast and very hospitable. One of my all time favorite sushi places."}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place when I was going to get a haircut next door.   Thought it was going to be a hole in the wall but when I walked in at 11:30 am I was taken back!  Beautiful interior and really authentic Japanese, but modern like I like it!  Very Spotless inside!  The place quickly filled up for lunch!  I started off with miso soup and a house salad!  Soup was good salad was not! Old lettuce for sure!  Then I had tuna sashimi and it was excellent!  Good Value for the amount! Usually doesn't work that way!    Proceeded onto a Veggie tempura and Salmon roll both excellent!  The  service was perfect and I liked the fact that there were real \"Japanese\" sushi chefs and employees, kept it authentic this way!  Whenever I come back to Vegas I will make the trip off the strip to come back!  It's only a few miles east on the 215 off Pecos Blvd.   I"}
{"text":"Nice fresh fish, nice sized portions, friendly service, classy decor. A solid AYCE sushi spot if you live in the GV area."}

{"text":"Unpretentious little place tucked into the north west corner of Yonge and Steeles. My review is for takeout. Friendly service and a nice treat to be served a mini crunch noodle soup and tea while I waited. Solid 3.5.  I read the scallop was awesome so had to have an order of scallop sashimi. It was delicious! Next up I loved that they offer mini rolls so that I could try a couple. I went with the torched salmon(Cinderella) and torched butterfish (Eskimo - need to find a better name for this one). The torched rolls may have been missing a touch of sauce on top of the torched fish, but they were still quite good."}
{"text":"Strengths: Friendly staff, nice ambience, open until 4am, spacious dining area. Great food!    Notes: I ordered pimp my roll and tonkotsu ramen. The ramen broth can be done a little creamier. Everything else was perfect. The roll was awesome!   Will go for lunch next time.ramen lunch special at $16 ramen and special roll"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service! We eat here allot and the sushi is always super fresh and at the perfect temperature. It truely is one of our favorite restaurants in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Sushi WOW. This place truly lives up to the hype.  The prices are on par with other sushi joints, but the quality of the food and service are exponentially superior. After my friends and I ordered, we were given a plate of rolls on the house, which were delicious. I ordered the sushi + sashimi dinner combo. The fish was all very fresh and delicious, and presented really nicely - noticeably more so than other restaurants. Once we finished, the owner, Joseph, also gave us the VIP treatment - asked for our names and offered us ice cream (which was served with corn flakes - seriously life changing). I may have to fully commit to this place from now on... I don't think other sushi joints will do it for me anymore.  Another cute addition to this place is the place mats with sushi etiquette comic strips on them... Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place was such an after thought I wondered if it was worth reviewing.   Two stars for being open so late, but that's the main thing it has going for it.  The beginning of April I pre ordered my role at probably 2am, and when I got there I stood there at least 5 minutes before being acknowledged.    This late at night I usually let service pass because I'm just greatful I can get food so late.  However,  the rolls are not cheap if you are doing Al la carte rather than doing all you can eat.  The fish and execution are on not high enough to merit those prices.   It seems artificially inflated to get you to choose the option of gorging yourself all night.     The roll I got was bland,  it was wrapped in cucumber, and the decorative cucumber on the side was not even cleaned. I rubbed my finger on it and dirt came off....if this is what you offer who would want all you can eat."}
{"text":"Great place to have all you can eat sushi. Fish was extremely fresh. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. Our waitresses was very helpful with our sushi roll selections."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was delicious for the price point. We came here for lunch on a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy.   When we inquired about one of the rolls, the waitress pulled out a photo album of pictures of all the different rolls so we could see what they looked like. And I liked that there wasn't a lot of rice in the rolls, compared to other restaurants.   They gave us complimentary appetizers and offered us free ice cream for dessert. When the chef/owner (Joseph) realized we worked close by, he also gave us a discount on our bill.   We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a shame..... Normally at a restaurant, either the waiter/ waitress service or the quality of the food reflect the rating on Yelp... This one is on the owner.  The Korean man/ owner was by the front door when we entered the restaurant. No greeting, just how many and lead us to table. Seems very impatient and got frustrated when I asked questions.... The most responses I got was \"ask your server\" Ok....  The rest of the servers were actually pretty nice and friendly.  Food taste and quality were surprising good... For AYCE sushi.   Would be a 5 stars rating if the owner weren't there to host... Sad...."}
{"text":"I have never had sushi as unique and amazing as Sushi Wa. The owner and staff are awesome, and the AYCE idea is brilliant and a great deal. The rolls are phenomenal and the ambience is really nice for a group dinner or even a date night! TVs, bar, large dining area, everything you'd need. I have eaten sushi in pretty much every state I have been to or lived in, and I have been to the most well known and highly ranked sushi restaurants in the Bay Area as well as Southern California and Hawaii. Sushi Wa comes close or is even better than any of them. Something about the restaurant and the rolls I just really love. I hope everyone gives it a try! Great location too."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow... I've tried multiple sushi restaurants in California, but hands down, this place is one of the best places I've ever tried. Their fishes were fresh, tempura oil was new, and customer service was on point. If you're around this area, I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to eat sushi. The service is amazing when she gave us options on popular rolls when we didn't know what to order. The menu is enormous with so many options from sashimi to ramens. Everything we tried was delicious. The price was also very reasonable for all that we were offered. 27$ for all you can eat dinner is a great price."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. We came in for lunch and the service and sushi was great. We both did AYCE, and the food and portions were perfect. Highly recommend the fire cracker app. The nigiri sushi was fresh and the fish was meaty and delicious. I would highly recommend for dinner or lunch as the restaurant has a great atmosphere and decor. We will being dinning here again."}
{"text":"Where to start?? The old, overly sticky rice? The dry rolls with no sauce? The brown avocado? The undercooked scallops that were still cold? The veggie roll that was comprised mostly of lettuce? The wasabi that was an odd color, nearly brown?   Don't understand the rave reviews, this stuff wasn't good at all. There are much, much better sushi places in Henderson people.  Two stars for the nice manager and the ambience."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service. Nice people. Try the poki salad and the screaming orgasm! Save room for the tempura ice cream!"}
{"text":"it really is hard to find a sushi bar that pleases you in every way.  Some places have great sashimi, but so so rolls.  Some places have great rolls but horrible sides.  some places are just horrible.  Here at Sushi Wa - EVERYTHING is great - decor, service, dessert, rolls, sashimi, appetizer sides - even the water.   Though everything is great, I highly suggest:  -Screaming Orgasm - the best orgasm sauce ever!  not too sour like other places.  4 pieces of fish served atop radish noodles soaking in a bowl of their sauce.  only one per person for their AYCE dinner.  Don't think you can order one for yourself, and one for a friend, hoping that your friend won't like it, so you can have more than one.   because he will.  and so will the next friend after that.  and the next after that.   - Firecracker - a small piece of crispy wonton, a cube of tuna and a cube of avocado, drizzled in firecracker sauce - Rose Roll - baked roll with lobster, scallops, mushrooms, onions - Who's Your Daddy - cream cheese and crab meat and sweet mayo and shrimp and it's deep fried in panko and crispy - Ahi Poke Salad - a little spice by thats ok.  mixed with seaweed salad.    all in all, my sushi palette has never tasted sushi this good."}
{"text":"Aloha,    I'm from Hawaii and I eat sushi all over Vegas.  This place by far is the worst place ever and I'll NEVER go back!!!  We ordered all u can eat.   Our server was Hayley, after we ordered our first items, we tried to get her attention to order more items. We didn't place our 2nd order for almost 30 minutes.    If we're ordering all u can eat, you would think she would be at the table more often.  They have no team work.  We asked 2 other servers there to order something, even a drink and they all told us that only our server could get it.  If I was the owner, they would all be fired.   It's called team work.   Help each other out.  After we were done, we had to ask for the bill cause no one seen to check if we were done.  Tables around us got their bill. before us and they didn't seat till after us. Smh.  Never again.   I will let people know that this place sucked!!   We had a piece of hair in our mussel and no manager came by to apologize.  We don't want nothing for free but as a owner/manager they need to go to school and take up business."}
{"text":"I've had sushi all over the country. This is the best I have ever had. Perfect texture and presentation. A+++"}
{"text":"What an awful experience this evening. We hardly ever go out to eat with our kids and we decided to treat them to sushi. This is their favorite place. Well I guess tonight was just \"too busy\" for good service. Our server was nice but I think she might have had to many tables. She rarely came back to ask how we were doing. When we wanted to order she told us to wait until our other 2 rolls were out so when she finally allowed us to order we sat for 25 min waiting for our food. We also asked if we could have a poki roll with only crab meat and avacodo and the manager said the were not taking special orders because they were again \"too busy\" I should take a picture but it's really not that busy. Haven't even had a wait for the hour and a half we have been here. To say the least we will not be returning. I feel like for $150 we should be able to order what we want. But obviously at sushi wa they don't care."}
{"text":"Went here with my little family of 3!   The look of the restaurant was very clean with a modern look. The decor reminded me of a restaurant on the strip.  I did the AYCE and my husband and 1 year old daughter shared chicken teriyaki.  My husband thought the chicken teriyaki was alright.  I always order nigiri sushi. Hamachi, my fav, is very fresh and good here! So is the tuna! The sweet shrimp is one of the best I've had!  Although the sushi was great, the service is slow. The service is friendly, just really slow.  Don't do AYCE at the booth because the service is slow for that, so sit at the bar. I don't recommend to bring your kids here at night because there is a pub right next door. Outside of the pub there is an outdoor seating area. I didn't like walking out at night into crowds of smokers with my kid.  I would love to come here again with just my husband. I would come here during the day with my family. My husband is not a sushi person, so it'll be awhile till we come back.  It wasn't bad for our first time. I just wish the service for me was quicker."}
{"text":"4.5  Pros: Very good sushi Friendly staff  Cons: Sushi portions could be better  Came here for a lunch one afternoon.  This is another one of those places where I have Yelp to thank for finding it.    Walking in, I notice the place looks much bigger on the outside than inside.  There's basically 5-6 tables here, that's it.  I'm guessing a lot of their business comes from people ordering to go.  We came at the start of lunch time so it wasn't too busy.  When we were finishing up though, all the tables were taken.  I take it when it's busy, you're better off getting take out.  Sushi Wa has a wide variety of sushi with some Korean items as well.  The owner is Korean so there are some Korean restaurant trends present here as well.  You get some free appetizers when you dine in like most Korean restaurants.  For any sushi newbies, they have a menu that has pictures of every item on the menu.  Pretty useful for newbies and anyone looking to try something new as well.  My GF and I both ordered lunch time bento specials.  I got the bulgogi and she got the Sushi bento.  I ordered an extra spicy salmon roll as well.  The bentos come out pretty quickly after ordering.  Overall, the bentos are really well done.  The sushi tastes pretty good and the bulgogi was cooked very well too.  My only little gripe is the fish portion on the sushi was a little on the thin side.  Bearing in mind that the prices are pretty good here, it's nothing too big  The service here is excellent.  The waitress was very attentive and patient through out our meal here.  Joseph, the owner is one of the most friendly owners I have ever met.  He introduced himself halfway through our meal.  He wanted to know our names and wrote them down promising to remember them if we came back.  It was very nice to have chat with him.  We were told if anything was wrong, he would fix it personally.  Overall, I really like this place.  It's a great choice for a comfortable, relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Amazing quality! Great servers, very respectful, and the sushi cooks are great at what they do. It may seem small on the outside, but the heart is what counts. Definitely worth a try if anything else."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place by far. Even the fancy sushi places on the strip don't compare. High quality sushi and you get your money's worth especially with AYCE. Recommend the Rose Roll. Also the peppered seared baby tuna and white tuna sushi is amazing. Can't find a white tuna that compares in any sushi restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Did a quick search of sushi in the area and found this gem. Arrived at 8pm and the place was still packed with happy customers. We ordered five sets of mini rolls between the two of us and it was quite filling. The complimentary dishes from the chef was very nice. The mango avocado roll was super refreshing. Ordered mini Eel Green, Pacific, Lion King, Rainbow, and Salmon Lover. Recommend Lion King and Pacific. The restaurant has around 8-9 tables. The place is cozy and staff was kind and attentive and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Not only was the service bad today more because of understaffed, but the chefs, which there were 3 were soo slow.  It took over an hour to get a California Roll and a cucumber roll.  Be prepared to spend 2 hours here minimum as most of the time will be waiting for your order."}
{"text":"Sushi flavours are amazing, the fish is always fresh here. One big plus is that you can really see the owner putting in a ton of effort into his small (but cute) sushi place. I basically eat sushi here more than any other place now, and the prices are really fair. :) Check it out, you won't regret!"}
{"text":"Giving three stars because the server was nice. Except there was only one of him and the place was busy. They should consider having atleast 2 servers because getting something as simple as water took forever.  I've had better sushi, and I find the price for the quality not worth it."}
{"text":"Most of the sushi is good, but I can't stand the taste of the propane gas torch that is used to sear the tuna. Yuck,"}
{"text":"So this place was recommended to me awhile ago and i am not sure what took us so long to try it but we are so happy we did!  The food is great, truly. Fresh fish that makes you forget you live in a desert. But what really stood out here was service. Everyone made eye contact and smiled and they all worked together as a team and never made you feel like \"oh you're not in my section let me go get your server...\" (I hate that by the way) and instead, you leave feeling like you had ten servers, all of whom were nice, friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.   There was one young man who chatted with us for so long happily answering all of my questions, seeming excited at the chance to educate us. Haha.   Try the baked mussels appetizer, the himachi, octopus, any signature roll, a seaweed salad, and a bottle of the strawberry sake with some fried ice cream... I know its a lot, but you won't regret it as it is all so worth it!"}
{"text":"Attention to detail in everything - freshness, quality and taste (outstanding!), presentation, service - well-deserving of its top reputation in the community.  Subdued with all cozy semi-private seating, centrally located at the intersection of Steeles & Bathurst with lots of free parking."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service in a nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"\"Wa-Wa\" (sound of failure).  Sushi wa-da-fa!?!  I got held hostage by a sushi bar!!! and not in a good way!  I came here with good intentions - going to Terri K's first UYE, sitting in the \"bamboo jail\" table with 12 other awesome yelpers and yelper friends, eating raw fish galore.  However, it did not turn out that way.  We came early (6 PM reservation) but could not leave until after 9:30 PM.  The only reason this gets one star from the restaurant side of things is that our bus boy was awesome.  He was polite, refilled drinks super fast, and cleared empty plates like Flash.  The service was deplorable.  We really only had one waiter, and he only liked one half of the table.  That half happened to include a lot of people that speak his language, so he spent all of his time taking their large orders and giving them food.  These are all my yelp friends, and I am glad I got to be with them, but the server only waited on them essentially.  When it came to our table, he never gave us what we ordered - 30 minutes passed and we had never received items, whereas our companions on the other side got several orders in and food was coming out in group portions.    The waiter argued with me after I asked 3 times for my mackerel sushi, one of the 3 things I ordered...after waiting 30+ minutes - he finally said he already brought it to the table (but it was someone else's order) and said I never ordered it.  After I asked for it 3 more times, couldn't he just put in another order?!  When I asked him a question about an item, he answered and ran off before I could order food.  I never got to order more than once, and most people on my side of the table had to re-order food or wait forever to order.  If only we spoke Korean!  The payment was a disaster too.  We asked for separate checks (for parties of one or 2 - we all did AYCE so it was same price all around) and we asked before we ordered and again before we asked for the check.  We were refused.  Our waiter gave attitude to Bobby Y. when he brought our credit cards and cash that added up exactly to the bill with gratuity.  Another waiter came over and Jieun spoke Korean with him - he said if he rings all of the cards up, he cannot put in any orders for other guests and they are BUSY (well, we were already there 3 hours hello!) so it would take him awhile.  Instead of going to start ringing our cards up though, he stood there and kept repeating the issues with their system - so I told him to go do it already!    It was an igloo in there - when Eric R. asked for them to turn the a/c up, I think that caused our waiter to hate us.  I had to borrow Nelson Q.'s jacket to survive the hours of hell.  I finally went to our car and put the heat on for 10 minutes.  The only reason I ate enough was that Jane shared some of the food from her side of the table with me, very generously (amaebi, ikura, saba, oysters) - because I never got my full and only order from the 6:15PMish range.  The upside -hanging with great people and meeting new people (Jane, Maria).  The envy - Terri K. bolting after convincing jerk waiter to give her a separate bill.  The downside - Wa still has a sticker on its door saying \"People love us on yelp.\"  I call BS on that!"}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat sushi place. They have so many special roles that are not available anywhere else. And their drink menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very very disappoint for a few different reasons. THIS PLACE DOES NOT DESERVE 5 STARS. In my opinion, maybe 2 or 2.5 at its best. I still have no idea how this place is able to maintain a 5 star rating on Yelp AND Google??!!  There is absolutely nothing special or stand out about this place - decor, ambience, kitchen, menu selection.   The only thing which was good, was the sushi chef, Joseph, greeted us after we paid the bill and took the time to talk to us and walk us out of the restaurant.  Menu - only regular buffet type of fish available  Was super disappointed as soon as I glanced at the menu, spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what I was going to order.. when I visit a 5 star a la carte jap restaurant, I expect more then just tuna, cooked shrimp, salmon, and white tuna on the menu..  30 pcs Sashimi boat was $30, pretty thinly sliced.. sake (salmon) sashimi was b grade, maguro (tuna) was also b grade.. cooked Ebi (shrimp) was from a vacuum pack..  I don't speak Japanese, but I tried to order some items using Japanese terms, waitress was clueless and needed me to order in English..  Seafood Udon had 2 over cooked chewy shrimp, 1 mussel, and 3 pcs of overcooked chewy squid.. udon was al Dante, soup base was legit..  Tempura Udon had 2 pcs of shrimp which was thick in batter and not crispy. 3 pcs of veggie tempura, the ponzu sauce came in a tea cup!? How are you supposed to sip your tempura into the tea cup!?  Rainbow Roll wasn't cut through all the way.. had to pull it apart with chopsticks and therefore started falling apart.. what Japanese chef doesn't keep their knife sharp?!  Ordered 2 cans of beer, the glasses had fingerprints and left over bits of something in the cup - so nasty!!  Billed with $100 plus tip..  This place was a complete waste of my time and meal!!"}
{"text":"One of the better ones in the area. Food was really good. We ordered the roll special (the combination of regular/special) for roughly $15 and it was plentiful. Also had a few sashimi that were great. I was disappointed that they ran out of my go-to fish: tuna belly.   For those complaining about the prices. There's free appetizers than can easily cost you $5 at least. Free parking in the complex, so that's another bonus.   In any case, it is definitely worth it, especially if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ok maybe its a bad night. The sauteed calamari smelled like fish out of lake mead, we've been here for over an hour and a half and there's only 2 of us here and the las Vegas roll is as big as an onion ring. Seriously?"}
{"text":"5* for what it is, a neighbourhood sushi joint that serves up better-than-average sushi that does put effort into presentation/service.  Atmosphere:  Restaurant itself is quite small and a bit squishy.  There are only about 8 tables and 2 seats at the \"sushi bar\".  If you're waiting for a seat, the front waiting area is tight.  If you're sitting in a booth, you'll have to physically shift the table in order to be able to sit on the bench.  Small restaurant was busy on a Friday night for dinner.  I'd suggest  you make a reservation to ensure that you get a seat!  Service:  A bit slow, but adequate by the waitress.  She actually didn't have to write our order down and it was accurate!  I was impressed.  At the end of our meal, Joseph, a middle aged man who I assume to be the owner came to our table and offered us ice cream \"on the house\".  He even asked for our names.    Food:  We ordered an array of items from maki, aburi nigiri, sashimi.  Combos did come with salad & miso soup.  Additional edamame and crunchy noodle soup was complimentary as well.  Sushi was fresh and there was attention to presentation.  Everything was good!  It wasn't a place with a lot of sauces.     As we left, Joseph came and bowed to us, physically opening the doors.  He seemed very sweet and cared about our patronage which did enhance my experience with this place."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! A hidden gem for sure. Everyone from the chefs to the host are genuine and polite. Four stars for now as I'm writing this while awaiting to try their menu items! Loving the experience thus far!"}
{"text":"New favorite all you can eat in town. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Thi and Joon and Celeste were amazing. Quick seating, wait time fair for everything and just super amazing food options. Banana tempura was delicious!!! Must try and it's definitely a cozy place to talk and just hang out. Try their sake sangria and Bohae raspberry wine!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town! Always good service and the most amazing food! It's a little pricy but definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. I love the ambiance and decor. Great selection and price. You cannot beat the all you can eat for lunch price!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place. Staff is very friendly and fast! Atmosphere is nice and relaxing. Come check this place out"}
{"text":"Great place to dine.  I love the menu selection and food.  I find the chef too humbling but an awesome person. They offer edamame beans and a small hot noodle appetizer before the meal. He comes by to see how you're doing as well.  Def would return. Try the aburi torched sushi!"}
{"text":"This is more than likely my favorite place for Sushi in all of Henderson.  I really like the set up its not a huge place but the use the space well.  I have been here at least 5 times and have done both bar seating as well as one of the many booths.  I always get AYCE because it is a fantastic value.  The ambience is good too, I used to dine at Sushi Mon but it has a more of a banquent feel to it.  Our waiter was pretty quick and attentive as well( he did forget an order of soup) but he was good enough for us to not really care.  If you are looking to try one of the many Sushi spots on eastern.....this is a must try."}
{"text":"We used to love this place..  Got taken care of by this server Mark. (Barely checked on us) All I can say is TOO MUCH RICE. The portion of the rice is more than the portion of the fish.  Fish quality, awesome!   We used to come to this place all the time. Used to brag about this place to all my friends. Now, I cant.. I seriously can't anymore. When we brought to the manager's attention that the rice portion was ridiculous (now I wish I could have taken a picture of it) he was totally cool about it and told us they'll fix it but the server came up all irritated and told us they can't tolerate it and will have to charge us next time we can't finish the rice. Server barely checked on us, it was mainly the manager. Server didn't smile for the most part.  Just super disappointed. We thought so highly of this place before & loved it so much that no matter how long the drive was,  we would go for the overall quality of the restaurant.. heartbroken Still tipped them good ;) cause it wasn't all bad. Manager was very personable :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visit sushi wa at least 3-4 times a month and we love it! By far the freshest sushi I have ever had! Everything is delicious especially the peppered seared tuna and the salmon nigiri! The baked salmon roll is creamy and delicious as well.   Sit at the sushi bar, order a cocktail, and enjoy the all you can eat!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I came here with my friend and we sat at the bar. We ordered a couple rolls and I asked for no avocado on mine. An order comes and I start eating it but it tastes nothing like what I ordered. So I let my friend have some. Then two orders came. One was the one I ordered and the other was what she ordered. Mine was loaded with avocado and hers had completely none! The taste was pretty good, nothing too special. But service sucked.."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner, Joseph, makes an effort to get to know his customers at the end of their meals. And he definitely remembers his repeat customers. If you are lucky, he will also treat you to a small appetizer dish or dessert \"on the house\". The Spicy Roll combo is my personal favourite."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese food in the GTA!! They serve authentic food with fresh ingredients, the chefs are Japanese as well. The price is very reasonable for the food quality. I want to recommend everything on their menu! Love this place so much. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Sushi Wa! We have been coming here since it opened and won't go anywhere else for sushi. The fish is flown in daily, and is always fresh. My favorite rolls are the Lava Roll (super fresh upgraded version of a rainbow), Bikini Roll (no rice, lots of fish), and Timmy Roll (soft shell crab and salmon). Also try the Pimp My Roll! It gets crowded on Friday nights, so make sure to come in early for faster service! Service is excellent, they always remember our special rolls and drinks."}
{"text":"I had my meetup group event there last night. They have some great quality of food. Staff there are so nice and kind too. Manager Gio, was really fast with service he knows what he's doing.  Owner Joon was really kind and nice too.  I liked their Sweet Shrimp Sushi. I've never seen shrimp that big in AYCE places. Impressed! And of course everything else was really good too.  And one more thing I like about this place was the interior. They have some good interior there. I heard this place is about 10 years old but place looks really clean and nice. I thought they just opened up or something. Really good place to have nice sushi night with either family or group of people. Even good for by yourself at the Bar. They have some really friendly sushimans ;P I will come out and have another event there! Really nice place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for sushi for many years, as a matter of fact, this is the only place we will go to when we want to have sushi. The food here is exceptional, all of it! The sushi chefs are great! The only downer here, and keep in mind we come here often and this has occured a lot lately, the service is not the best. We noticed that if you sit at the bar this is not an issue but if you sit at a table, forget about it. Our last visit was the tipping point, waited for ten minutes and nobody approached us to order or even ask for our drink order. The guy who seated us passed by and we had to flag him and ask if we could order, he signaled to a lady and said she would take our order....well we waited and waited and she didn't even acknowledged us. Well he came back with his note pad and asked if we would be doing all you can eat. After ordering my appetizer and some sushi, the sushi arrived first and no sign of my appetizer? Asked the waiter and he was was like \"oh yes\" and went to the back and then brought it to us. Best advice, just eat at the bar.  Update: we came here again and sat at the bar this time. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"I believe this place used to be called Asahi Sushi for the longest time. I was walking my dog in the area and was kind of surprised to see the exterior change and also the name change too, so I decided to definitely try this place sometime later on...when I wasn`t walking my dog. It was always in the back of my mind whenever I was in this plaza (same plaza as Freshco) but I never got a chance to try it.  I finally decided to come here for lunch. It was around noon and I think we were the only guests at the time. I found this place very small and cramped for each table. When we were shown to our table, I was trying to wrap my head around how we were supposed to enter our booth (the table is very long and blocks off the entry to the seats). The waitress had to physically move the table sharply off to one side to let each of us enter to our seats. This is one thing I found uncomfortable about my dining experience while I was here. Even stick thin people cannot enter the booth without moving the table...That is how cramped it was. We also had to physically move the table to free ourselves out of the booth after paying the bill lol.  I had a look at the menu, and we were also given a photobook of their menu items which is something I haven`t seen at any sushi places before, which is nice. I noticed they also do some korean dishes (not officially on their main menu). So, I ordered the lunch special roll set. It was a pretty good deal. I got to choose a special roll (8pcs) and a mono roll (6 pcs) for 12.50$ which also comes with soup and salad (but is not mentioned on the menu). Really good value for the amount of good sushi. I was surprised when the waitress came to our table and also served us come complimentary appetizers before we started our lunch. It was really nice of them. When my order arrived I really thought the presentation was cute. The sushi tasted really fresh and good. The special roll I ordered was not cut up evenly, some pieces were larger than others making it slightly difficult to put into my mouth, but for the most part was manageable.  What really stood out in this place I think was the really courteous service. I also thought it was really nice of the sushi chef to come by and ask us how our meal was."}
{"text":"The best sushi experience ever!  Unlimited high quality sushi that just kept flowing.  Servers worked as a team.  A plate never sat.  Our drinks never empty.  The atmosphere is perfect!  Don't pass on this one.  I'll be back in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Food was very reasonably priced and the service was great! I like how you can order mini versions of the rolls, 5 pieces instead of 8. This way you can try a variety of different things. The takoyaki and sushi pizza were really good. They also gave us some free appetizers which was very kind."}
{"text":"Freeessssh sushi and the prices are good as well! Must try for every sushi lover out there! I tried the Rainbow sushi and Salmon lover sushi, loved them both! ((: I also tried their takoyaki, alsoo delicious! ((:"}
{"text":"We love sushi. We HATE Sushi Wa. We decided to try a new sushi restaurant and regret it. First their sushi wasn't good. Their sauces were bland. Second. And this is a HUGE SECOND.. The staff is awful.  The guy we got must of been in a badass mood or just has had a bad attitude.  The whole experience here was bad. We will definitely never come back. Go somewhere else for AYCE sushi, seriously."}
{"text":"About a year ago, the boyfriend and I went in to SushiWa and immediately walked out when we saw not one single customer inside.   A year later, it seems like SushiWa is what everyone talks about if you live in the 89052 area code.  We finally gave it a try yesterday, and I was reasonably pleased.   The decor inside is very modern and roomy.  Not like your typical AYCE joints in town - where you can reach over to the table next to you with your chopsticks to try out their dishes.    Their menus cover your basics but with a little more.  This AYCE actually gives you sashimi (one order per person).  That was pleasantly surprising.  We then ordered our usual sushi and rolls.    The fish is VERY fresh.  The boyfriend claims that the super white tuna there is by far the best he has had, even better than the ones in California.  I must say that the freshness of the fish is comparable to the freshness of the ones in Hong Kong, so that's saying a lot.    The sushi was made of little rice and a big chuck of fish - just the way I like them.  The rolls were somewhat difference because they were cut very thinly.  Must try the super spider roll made with soft shell crab and shrimp tempura - yummy!   Their fresh oysters are also very delicious, but also one order per person - boo.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at SushiWa and will definitely return since it is so close to my house.  Another nice thing about it is that there is no wait.  AYCE sushi joints usually have at least a 30 minute wait, and it is just plain ol' obnoxious.    Aside from the thin rolls, this place lost a star because of its strict rules about how many order per person.  By the time we had our third rounds of orders, I was getting so frustrated about what we had already order or what we can't order.  But it is what it is!  Oh, our server, Monica, was a sweetheart.  However, you guys must be mindful that this restaurant is owned and run by Koreans, so it is not your typical/ordinary Japanese place.    Lastly, this place plays awesome music!  Fresh fish, great service, awesome music!  You should be sold by now.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is awesome. 1/2 price on many of the sushi items during lunch.  My recommendations are the ultimate salmon lover's roll, pocky roll, spider roll, and the 911 roll. The 911 came with this really good spicy sauce. It didn't taste like ponzu but it was just as spicy.  The service was friendly and good. They brought every roll that we asked for and filled our drinks whenever they were low.  The ambiance and decor was really nice.  I think you can purchase your own chopsticks and they keep it there for you."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the seafood udon! Full of rich ingredients, very generous portion of seafood. Sushi is nothing out of the ordinary but very good for the price you're paying! I agree that the service puts them up to a 5 star rating for sure! Owner and sushi chef Joseph made it a point to come by each table and introduce himself and get our names! Give us a very homey feeling!"}
{"text":"Went and tried out this place today and it was awesome :) waiter was nice and very fast. Didn't take long to get food. Bill was 60$ for all you can eat both plus a tea. Not too bad for a date night. And definitely got money's worth!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to sushi spot, but the service has gone so down hill that I won't be coming back here. I guess that's what you get when you add nepotism to a restaurant. You get somebody who doesn't really care about the service twice in a row I have eaten here when there was literally no tables other than me and waited more than 20 minutes for a single roll there are too many sushi places around to waste your time with this place"}
{"text":"Can we give this place a negative star??? The food is good but the service SUCKED bad! We only received half our order and I took literally 35mins for the first roll to hit the table, there was only like 8 tables being used so it was not busy at all. All and all I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"Came back for more! Again-great service and fresh and interesting sushi! Tried the Ramen tonight along with the baked mussels and both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town hands down. Joon thanks for everything!!! I've lived in San Diego for almost two years now and I still crave sushi wa. Fresh and delicious every time !"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings towards this place.. I had come here for dinner around 5pm on a Wednesday evening, and I had all you can eat sushi.  The pros of this place is the service and cleanliness! Especially from our specific bus person - a tall lanky fella - who I didn't get to catch the name of, but he definitely was on top of asking if we'd like any plates out of the way and our drinks were always refilled constantly.   Now for the cons which really had to be brought up.. The food quality.  Now I'd understand if it was really busy (which it wasn't whatsoever), but the sushi rolls seemed like it was meh. 6-7/10. Example: The rolls ordered that had unagi (fresh water eel) on top had tiny burnt pieces of eel on top. And the nigiri I had ordered always had a fat piece of rice under the fish.   Now for my lady's bento box she ordered.  She decided to go with the teriyaki beef bento, And it came with everything any other bento box would come with (vegetable tempura, 1/2 roll of California roll, house salad) and it wasn't anything special. Yet it came out to $16.. Definitely not worth it as much.  Sadly I wish I captured photos but I didn't get to..   Overall this restaurant ambience was nice. Dimly lit, and decorated nicely. Nothing bad to say about the servers or restaurant itself.  A good date night for anybody craving sushi in general. DISCLAIMER: *I'm just nit-picky about my sushi quality after going to so many ayce sushi spots* lol.   Thanks Sushi Wa."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  The pepper seared tuna sashimi is the most delicious food i have ever tried. The all you can eat is a great value with 90% of the menu avaliable."}
{"text":"First time here.. the monkey brain is delicious.. the pork belly is deep fried a little weird for me.. the baked green mussels are amazing.. definitely worth a second order"}
{"text":"best sushi I ever had! great service along with a wide selection of excellent sushi. little unknown gem - try the tempura fried shrimp heads (not on menu)."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here,it's very good place for me because I get off the work really late at work...so I am so happy they open till to 4am.last time I order spicy Korean ramen and tuna poke ,tasty very good and tonight I will try something else.."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, I love that the special rolls come in mini size. I was able to buy multiple rolls and try them all.   Presentation was beautiful, taste was amazing.   The customer service was amazing, the chef came out and asked us how our meals were and even offered us free ice cream.  I totally recommend this place. And would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food, great service with good price. We ordered Chirashi and sushi bento which taste very good. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"WA WA WA.  Yep, every time I passed Sushi Wa, I promised myself I would never eat there.  Why?  Because I had eaten there for lunch one day with the wife and mother in law.  I found the food was average at best.  However, one of my kids friends from 808 said that this was one of his fav places so I said, okay what the heck....  So, on a Saturday night about 8:30 pm, I came here with my young son who has never had real sushi before, only the western style sushi...  a.  Ambiance - We sat at the bar, which I never do due to larger crowds and we want to have conversation.  The bar is the best place here to sit. Everywhere else seems a bit too \"cold\".  but the bar is really simple and comforting at same time.   b.  Service - Very, very good.  Attentive to our needs, mostly Korean speaking, but basic Japanese words are discussed.  Small amounts of rice, that is cool!  c.  Food - here is where it is amazing:  a. Tobico - Flying Fish Roe with squid ink to a black caviar style look.  what a cool dish. Tasty and unique.  b. Amai Ebi - Here the sweet shrimp was perfect and the fried shrimp heads were suckilicious.  Meaning I  was sucking and chewing on these fried heads like it was fried chicken!  Yummy.  c.  Maguro - I always ask for Maguro with a sliver of lemon and jalapeno I did not get this here when I ordered it. Instead of a sliver of lemon, with the rind and all, I got a peeled lemon with the meat only and sprinkled with shavings of jalapeno.  this was AMAZING  d.  Uni - Fresh, awesome texture.  My young son ate it too!  That says it all.  e. Breakdown - OK, broke down and had a Dragon Roll, the quintessential westernized plan for sushi.  even this was good and I was most impressed.  This place is my newest and most favorite sushi place in the 89052 area code."}
{"text":"I come often for lunch. The staff, especially the owner, Joseph, are very pleasant. Always a very positive vibe in this place.   And the quality of food is definitely better than I'd expect for the price. In fact, downtown I bet a lot of people have paid twice as much for lower quality.   I keep meaning to try the sashimi, but almost always end up having sushi bento and tempura. Not much of a roll person myself, but like the sweet potato roll.  When I want to stay close to home, I probably won't go anywhere else for sushi."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favourite sushi restaurants uptown - service is impeccable and the staff are very attentive. Someone who I presume is the owner walks us out and holds the door open every time when we are ready to leave, even if we are just ordering takeout. He even puts in the effort to recognize all returning customers and calls us by name if he remembers it. After only ordering takeout twice, he said \"Welcome back!\" which pleasantly surprised us. We have since been back quite a few times over a short period of time for both take-out and dine-in.   Most Japanese restaurants uptown serve a soup and salad as an appetizer - here they serve a salad and a small bowl of noodles which is quite unique. The food is excellent and the sushi rice has the perfect balance without being overly acidic. The rolls are assembled very well with the perfect amount of pressure being applied - made evident as the rice still holds its shape without being overly compressed. The fish is as fresh as they come in that area and they don't serve uni when it is off-season. As disappointed as I was to not have uni, I highly respect their decision because it speaks to their quality of standards.   The only criticism I have is for the booth seatings by the window. The rectangular tables are a little oversized for the booth which makes getting in and out quite difficult. But this is highly forgivable as the  sushi is so so good.   I highly recommend this sushi restaurant to both those who are or are not in the area - this place is worth the drive and is very budget-friendly for high quality sushi. Service is second to none."}
{"text":"Ponzu everything. Rude staff. Warm, unmanageable rice. Waste of money.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Not exactly sure where the 4 stars rating came from.  My husband and I dined here for lunch and was far from impressed.  We started with hamachi, ahi and salmon nigiri.  Was that really sushi grade? All 3 taste nothing like what it's suppose to and left our mouths with the worse metallic after taste. Sushi rolls and appetizers have zero flavor and they love to serve things one at a time with a 5-8 minute wait time in between each entree as well as use tons or rice to get us full much faster.  As for the service, the lady at the door wasn't very pleasant but our server was nice.  Doubt we'll ever come back.  Goyemon seems to be at the top of our list and the best ayce sushi restaurant by far."}
{"text":"Tiny little spot near Bathurst and Steeles that is just bursting with flavour! My friend and I went here on a Saturday evening for lunch and were seated right away.   The good and bad:  Good: - Joseph the sushi chef was incredibly kind and likes others mentioned came out chatted with us and gave us free dessert. Such a kind man, VIP treatment indeed! - servers are super attentive! - food is fresh and absolutely delicious - it's a family run business and you can tell the food is made with love - rolls are incredibly massive and stuffed generously - pricing is similar to other sushi restaurants  Bad: - tiny amount of seating, had we cone later we wouldn't have gotten seats. - the decor could use some sprucing up.   I would definitely trek it out again, and maybe this time make reservations."}
{"text":"Warm and cozy sushi shop. My family and I came here on Family Day and it was a great experience. The fish were extremely fresh and tasty. We had the Family Boat and it was amazing. We were also treated with tako yaki, fried oysters, some kind of vegetable mango sauce wrap, and other wonderful dishes.  The chef/owner was really nice and friendly and the interior was clean. Overall, great experience and looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"best sushi in the area. They actually have real wasabi here if you ask for it. The Henderson Roll rocks too, love the sauce on that one."}
{"text":"Exceptional service from Joseph and the staff at Sushi Wa. We got 2 medium sushi boat and that filled all of us. The surprise apps and deserts were a delight. Best sushi restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"You know the dining experience at Sushi WA has always been hit or miss.  Today's lunch is definately a miss.  They served me bad fish.  I sent it back  just to let them know since it was AYCE so the price doesn't change.  The Chef tried to convince me it was Hamachi belly.  He backed off when I told him truthfully that I eat sushi weekly.  Even if it was Hamachi belly, it should be fresh.  It tasted sour and has obviously been sitting around.  They said they would give me another part of the fish.  I asked for Hamachi from another fish.  I didn't get any.  I didn't get much service either.  One of the chefs perfunctorily asked how everything was.  I began to complain and he shut me down and ignored me.  What is the point of asking?  To add insult to injury, I waited for a long time for my check to be processed.  I asked about it and the waitress rudely said that their machine was offline and that I'd have to wait.  Well, wouldn't it have been nice if somebody let me know they are having tech difficulties instead of letting me sit there and stew?  No attempt at service recovery was made."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is Awesome I come every week for lunch  the Lunchbox Special with my 80 year old mother and She Loves It!! Fish is Fresh!! Real Crab Meat And The Ginger is  fresh ( Not Pink in a jar!!) I highly recommend this restaurant it is extremely reasonable and not too pricey!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful break from the heat. The atmosphere is very cool and serene and clean. The service is excellent. The food is superb. I had a great time I would definitely recommend it this is one of my go to local favorites"}
{"text":"Mmmm. yum. even for the veggi... The all you can eat menu for lunch is a GREAT deal. I recommend going at odd hours, like after 1:30p for lunch and after 7:30pm for dinner. If you go during peak hours the quality of the preparation is a little limited, but not enough to lose some stars. Love the Vegetarian (requested) bikini roll!!!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice sushi restaurant. It's unassuming from the outside - just tucked into a strip mall - and the interior furnishings, while comfortable, aren't anything to write home about (they also play top 40 on the radio, which was a bit strange). But the food and the service are both fabulous. We started with some edamame and a seaweed salad, which were both tasty. Then we split five specialty rolls among the four of us (which was actually too much food - I'd recommend just one roll per person, since they're large). All of the sushi was delicious - as well as beautifully styled. Plus, at the end of the meal, the sweet sushi chef Joseph came out to chat with us. Overall we had a great experience - highly recommend."}
{"text":"I still continue to go here, going anywhere else ends in disappointment, of all the many places I have been in Las Vegas the fish here is always fresh and the staff is always top notch Gio the manager is awesome and always has my favorite drink and seat ready and waiting for me.  If you like fresh sushi at a VERY reasonable price this should be your spot!!  $22 for all you can eat  lunch and $27 for dinner is CHEAP considering the quality and service you get here!"}
{"text":"Such a awesome sushi place!! Sushi is fresh with great portions! Decent prices and a very clean and modern atmosphere ! The staff is nice and very efficient! Will for sure  be going back :)"}
{"text":"With all you can eat restaurant, service is pretty important. More so than other regular ala carte restaurants since you want to order more as you go. Service was really slow since there was only one server. Not sure why there is only one server working since they were pretty busy. Also, their menu was so confusing. Why not have one menu for ala carte and a different menu for All u can eat? Also, so many confusing restrictions on one order per person on sashimi, mochi, etc. Id rather go to other AycE sushi places like Kaizen or Umiya etc."}
{"text":"My go to sushi spot, especially for AYCE! The Hawaiian Roll is UNREAL! It is literally my favorite roll of all time and any sushi restaurant I have ever been to! June and his team make great food and are friendly faces who take good care of everyone. We also love their deep fried banana and ice cream desert to finish off our meals!"}
{"text":"SUSHI Waa--heres my order?   Sushi wa-s the server ever gonna take an order?  Sushi wa-it.   Sushi wa-tttt theee FUCK?!  Im sitting in \"bamboo jail\" as I write with all the Yelpers here for a UYE. We started at 6pm, it is now 8:50pm as I start this review and we are sitting waiting on them transacting everyone out.  Food is still decent, however service is rude and inefficient from our main server. One half of the table was getting service and the other half where I was sitting was kinda ignored a lot more, waited more to put orders, etc. He'd take their order, leave, come back with something for them and then we would have to try to flag him. We'd wave him, he'd say he'll be back and doesn't come back to us or he would walk passed us like we didn't wave at all. A few people had lost orders and instead of saying something kind like \"sorry, let me go check on that and get it out\"....it's more of remarks like we never put the order, you got it (no someone else got it) ,etc. One of our Yelpers asked three times to get her first order when the other side already on their 2nd round of orders.   I was gonna do 3 stars but now with tge transactions, I'm miffed. First, they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it because they're busy.  We computed what we all owe and wrote in the back which cards to charge what. Now something with POS being the only one for orders and transactions so they don't want to back up orders by transacting all us out so they'll transact when orders aren't coming in. We had a Korean speaking Yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manager who said he will do it in a bit. We had to wait for him and explain everything. It took like 20 minutes of discussing things and explaining how we wrote down what before they went to the back to start. We have no choice but to wait. I'm sorry, but one thing I learned about restaurant hospitality that turnover is important because waiting for a check lowers the impression farther than waiting a bit for good food. People are done and want to just go. We finally got our receipts back and......  they charge my credit card for two drinks and two AYCE.   We wrote everything down clearly on the back on to receipt. We put the last 4 digits of each card to identify them and what amount to charge to each card. HOW is that NOT clear enough? They charged me for someone else.   Okay, so basically then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash people some change. Well, first time they not only gave me less than what I was owed, but also no change for people with cash. They finally gave it and we left at 9:40pm.  50 minutes to transact is pretty crazy long.   I know it's easy to say that well, it's a pretty a-typical effed up situation. That maybe with the busy place and a waitstaff that doesn't micromanage it well it went down south fast. However, I do have previous visits where I do specifically state how odd the service was odd, not friend and inefficient so that holds true that the waiter service isn't that good here. Also, it got super busy on my last visit towards the end of my dinner and I also waited 20 minutes to get a mochi and 15 minutes more to get my check back to sign so I was held hostage prior to this. So no, it can happen to you in some degree.   Please retrain the staff....and HIRE some good servers. The busboy was polite and did more than just remove plates by checking orders and refilling drinks. PLEASE make him a server and maybe make your rude server a busboy until he learns how to talk to people.   I don't deny the AYCE is good, but if you go then don't go at peak hours, don't sit at a table- ONLY with the nice sushi bar guys and do cash if you have a party splitting the check.   Look at how thorough I was in taking pictures and reviewing individual items because I wanted people to come with my last review. However after this incident I am not recommending it or coming back. I was frustrated all throughout the meal and exasperated at how I was charged and then shortchanged cashback. I haven't felt this way about a dining experience in a long time so 1 star isn't out of line.  There are many AYCE areas in the area including my favorite, Island Sushi whose staff is pure aloha hospitality.  Update- Owner sent a apologetic note....I give him kudos for that and would've given a star for his professionalism. Then a week later I get a anonymous note from someone in henderson talking about me giving bad reviews and how dare I \"destroy families\". Given that I only have 15 1 star reviews out of nearly 500 and havent given a bad review in ages, it made me wonder. Then I found out other people got the same message that dined with me here so it doesn't take two to figure out our crabby server didn't like what we said. SO unprofessional and cowardly! Your server really made sure we don't come back."}
{"text":"SOOO yummy!! Their all you can eat is really worth it! Me and my boyfriend decided to be fatties and do the all you can eat, we literally ate 100+ dollars worth of food. It was amazing, Everything is all you can eat, appetizers, desserts, sushi rolls....AMAZING..and it all tasted BOMB.  I recommend the rose roll, sooo yummy"}
{"text":"The service was great. My friend told me that their food is delicious and not that pricey. Also, we didn't expect that Joseph (Chef) treat us free ice cream (maybe he knows my friend who went their frequently) anyway, I highly recomment Sushi Wa not only for the food but also great customer service. Sugoi!"}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner with my girlfriend around 10pm. We came because we knew it was all you can eat and we were starving! We starting ordering nigiri and we were at about 6 different types but they only come 2 per order so it would have only been 12 pieces shared between the both of us and the server told us to stop ordering because it would be way too much to eat. So we just kind of looked at her and said okay. We got the order and finished it quick because it was little and we were hungry. So my girlfriend ordered an udon and the waitress said that it came with a lot of noodles so we shouldnt order anything else.  Last time I checked it was ALL YOU CAN EAT. We can eat a lot and we were starving. And worse the little bit of food we were allowed to order didnt even taste good. It was mediocre at best. There are many other AYCE sushi places around and I'll definitely be going to those instead now and I recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"I've been a friend of Joon the owner and his faithful customer for around 7 years.  Great quality good, chill vibe, and the food is delicious.  The sushi chefs Danny and Waldo definitely keep the menus interesting.  Definitely a MUST have"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food and great price! There was a wide selection for all you can eat. We enjoyed different rolls and had so much fun of the names of the rolls. Also the Hamachi and Salmon color was spot on! The Staff was very nice. We enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"It's a decent AYCE sushi restaurant in Henderson, NV and worth the visit if you are in the area.  With the standard selection of sushi, I couldn't find a bad choice.  The fish is fresh, the rice is done right, the cuts of fish is precise and service is quick and friendly.  One note, you can pay extra if you want sashimi, but you only have one serving.  I would recommend to make your choice worthwhile, i.e. hamachi.  Also, this would also get you deep fried prawns including the heads."}
{"text":"Im taking stars away for a few reasons.   1- my sisters and I are practically professional at AYCE sushi. So we may have frightened our sushi chef when we ordered 20 different items right from the get-go! Need I mind you, 20 items mostly consisting of sushi that comes 2 to an order at which we order 3 of each can seem like a lot of orders but not between 3 girls. Our server came back to tell us \"you know you have to eat everything in all you can eat or you get charged from left orders?\" My sisters and I looked at each other with a smirk. Oh yeah! We know!! She proceeded to tell us that they are going to break up our order in half just in case we don't eat it all. Needless to say we shocked the staff by ordering more and desert!! We weren't worried about them breaking it up in half because we knew we would eat it, the timing between was just slow. Hence why we order everything first. There's nothing like a 10-15 minute gap between orders.   2- this might be TMI but I'm breastfeeding, so I can't have spicy food without burning my son's butt. I am also lactose so I can't have cream cheese. My one sister doesn't like to try new things so she likes to stick to what she knows, while my other sister is adventurous. The fact that they don't do half orders during AYCE is disappointing. The half orders are a good way for us to try a little bit of everything so we can see what we like. But we were told we can only have our last order be a half order. Bummer!! I honestly Never heard of that, and I frequent sushi!   I will say the sushi was good, and the service was ok. But what sets this place apart from the rest is their AYCE- it really left us disappointed. Being a big sushi lover, I'm sad to say neither of my sisters nor myself will be coming back and is no longer on our recommended places of sushi."}
{"text":"Wuv this yoint. The option for AYCE is amazing. We wuv this place. Only place to go in Henderson.  Wuv the Dragon Rolls."}
{"text":"The owner came around and introduced himself and asked how everything was which was a nice touch!  Offered us dessert and took our ice cream order which was a nice touch!  Just wish they came around to refill our tea without asking. Pet peeve of mine!  Fish was sliced a little too thinly I think and very small sushi pieces in comparison.   Otherwise a 5 stars for sure.  Will try again for lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered here through uber eats and it was really great! I got the sushi platter when I ordered but wasn't sure what rolls were coming as it didn't say in the app.  There were 45 pieces in total. The 7 rolls they gave us were California, avocado/cucumber, spicy salmon, unagi, crab, sweet potato, and dragon roll. All of the sushi was great and really yummy!   Would definitely order here again and try it out at the location!"}
{"text":"We go here quite a bit and always have a really great time.  We sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are friendly and seem to  remember everyone.   Cool place.  Looks so-so from outside but is really nice inside!"}
{"text":"Sushi Wa in a convenient location with awesome food! Highly recommend the seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Took family there for late lunch because my daughter back from college remembers it being good.  My sushi was worst I have ever had in Henderson (which has a LOT of sushi offerings).  The salmon and yellowtail actually smelled bad --- we should have left, but were all hungry.  The worst was the spicy octopus --- one of the two only had two VERY SMALL cuts of the fish --- for $5.50.  We will never go back there ---- they are MUCH better places to go in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda at a lost for words because I like how the place is set up and in the beginning when you come here they make you feel happy but after you order your first round they seem to not care about serving you anymore..you literally have to call them or you never get in your second order or drink refills...you guys have some work to do..ive tried this place twice so its not because they were busy or the server.."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa   What can I say. AMAZING service, & food! I found this place as a standing 5 star on Yelp and wanted to try it out. So I came here considering all the hype... And what can I say, it stands 5 stars. Yelp reviewers are definitely right.   Service - A+. Came in and was seated right away on a Friday night (though we got the last spot hehe). Joseph the owner came around to personally give us his card, write down our names on his notepad and even got to know us a little bit! Waitresses always kept an eye on our booth to make sure no drinks were empty or we were ready for our next dish. Amazing.   Food- ordered the family boat Wa for 2. Was given 2 complimentary appetizers on top of our starting soup, tempura and edamame! Amazing. When the sushi boat came, I was already satisfied with flavour! The sushi boat was great too!! Fresh sashimi cuts, great fish to rice proportion. Last dish with the family boat wa was the chicken teriyaki and it was another hit!! To end it off, we had a choice of different ice cream flavours. We got red bean and boy... Was it a generous portion after all that food.   VERDICT- you must come here! Hidden gem and bang for your buck. Quality. Service. Food. Everything. :) definitely coming back in the near future and trying out other things. loved it."}
{"text":"Very small but the service is really good, friendly stuff, the chefs it's an excellent cook, also very humble and kind, he comes after you finish you and shakes your hand and talks to you, very friendly.  Overall the good quality is excellent, I've tried almost every single sushi and all of them are awesome (green and white dragon being my favourite ones )"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. I love this place. They have an all you can eat special that is hard to resist.  My mom lives in Michigan and my sister in California and whenever they are in town we go to Sushi Wa.  The interior is very nice and modern.  The service is impeccable.  Most important, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The Food is Great.... but the service absolutely SUCKS !          A shame because it's such a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really liked the owner of this place. He's a really nice guy who's doing a great job operating this restaurant. I had a lovely chat with him on random topics. The staff at his restaurant are all very friendly, polite and courteous. No complaints in that department.  As to the food, it's not bad, neither is it phenomenal. It's alright. I'd say it's in line with other mid-tier sushi joints in the GTA. I'm not sure if there's anything particularly outstanding about the quality of rice or freshness of fish. It's alright, hence the 3-star rating.  Would I be back? If not for the food, definitely for the owner to say \"hi\" to him :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get beautiful and delicious sushi in Las Vegas.  It's located across from Trader Joe's on Eastern and Coronado Center.  Maybe the location is the reason why it's always deserted, but that's no reason to miss out on fantastic nosh that tastes as great as it looks.  Joon, the owner, is a fantastic and the service is excellent.  They're attentive without being intrusive, which is always a treat to find in a restaurant where you aren't paying over $60 a plate.  Joon also treated my boyfriend and I to real wasabi--not the green kind, but the kind made from real wasabi root--because we had mentioned that we had never tried real wasabi before.  The fish is fresh, and the rolls are creative.  I would recommend the monkey brains and the tuna tartare for appetizers.  You will also be offered miso soup with your dinner, but there isn't anything standout with the miso soup.  It's good to cleanse the palette before your meal.    For their rolls, try it all out.  I like the tiger roll, superman roll, Joon's special.  I don't have them memorized, but I've never been disappointed with an order.  Overall, the food is wonderful, the people there are friendly and unpretentious and the decor echos their menu: modern, chic and tasteful."}
{"text":"This place is over-priced and over-rated.  You are paying for the ambience.  Service was excellent.  i had the sashimi combo and spicy tuna roll.  Two things that are easily comparable between restaurants.  Tuna was overly dyed dark red and the yellow tail was the toughest I've ever eaten.  However, the spicy tuna roll was a generous serving.  On top of the disappointment of my dining, I started experiencing food poisoning symptoms a few hours later. Sushiwa put a damper on my plans the whole next day.  Too bad Vegas has no exceptions on their ticket refund policy."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing!! We loved the environment as well. Osvaldo was the one who made our sushi and everything we had,  satisfied our sushi snob taste. The rose roll and the scallop crunch roll are a must order. We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a handful of times and while the service has been slow, the sushi has always been worth it. Sadly, not the case today. HORRIBLE service. Our waitress was so incredibly rude and recited the AYCE rules and time limits on top of trying to charge extra for things we've always gotten in the past. The halibut was disgusting. With no one in the restaurant you'd think they'd try and be accommodating to our party but it was exactly opposite. Won't be coming back here ever."}
{"text":"Good food! The service needs improvement. We needed to make eye contact or wave them down when we needed somethIng. It seemed like they forgot about us.  Other than the service I recommend eating there."}
{"text":"Some people eat just to eat as they routinely do to fulfill their three squared meals a day. I, on the other hand, eat because I have a love for food. My facebook photos can attest to that.  Knowing that, Sushi Wa is my answer when people ask me what the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas... with a grain of salt. Although Sushi Wa has its high points, it also has some low points, thus not earning its full five stars. Here's a list of likes and dislikes...  Like:  - Each person gets one order of sashimi as part of their AYCE experience.  - Fresh and thick cuts of fish  - Best tasting Unagi I've ever eaten. Generously cut and quickly seared to get a crispy edge to contrast the soft texture. (I usually never order Unagi since its rather unhealthy)  - A wide selection of side dishes  - Small details that make each dish a little extra... For example, in the Udon, there are shiitake mushrooms. You normally wouldnt see that in an order of Udon from the AYCE menu.  Dislikes:  - No half roll orders unless its your last roll.  - Limited selection of dessert... And I hate how they drizzle chocolate on every piece of dessert.  - Slow service. Some of the male wait staff seem lost.   For me, the list of likes out weigh the list of dislikes. I mostly order Nigiri so the thick slices of fresh fish are more important than desserts. Slow service? Well, that just means more time to talk with my dining date. I've eaten here well over five times and each person I bring has come back to bring other people. Sure, other AYCE eat places might have a thing or two that is done better, but Sushi Wa has the best Nigiri.   Photos included!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Always convenient and quick! The food is fresh and hot. I enjoy eating here because there is enough room to order Ayce without bumping into other customers!"}
{"text":"Normally enjoy the meal here, but with no half orders, an almost explanation that any amount of sushi left on plate will result in additional item charge, and a severe flown from the sushi chef the entire time, our Sunday Sushi wasn't enjoyable. :("}
{"text":"My sister and I were in the area while waiting on repairs to be completed to my car so we decided to stop by and grab a bite to eat. When we first walked in, the place has a very warm and cozy environment. We were greeted at the door and walked over to our seats. The menu has many option to choose from but we ordered from their dinner bento and a their speciality sushi. The service was a bit slow but there were many people there so I understood and it didn't bother me too much. They were very attentive and kept ensuring we were doing okay. Then Joseph one of the sushi chef came out, greeted us and offered us ice cream at the end of the meal. I thought that was the sweetest thing and never have a ever experienced that in a restaurant before. We had a great experience not just the meal itself which was excellent but with the employees that worked there. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely be visiting."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this place because Joon, the owner, always makes sure to take very good care of us. Usually we order the all you can eat sushi which in and of itself is amazingly priced and encompassingly delicious. Everything from the udon to the seemingly endless list of rolls. But Last night my girlfriend and I decided to try something new: Omakase.  For those of you who are unaware, Omakase in Japanese roughly translates to \"I leave it to you.\" Meaning the chef has free reign to give you whatever they think you'll love and you as the customer must have full faith in the chef that they will provide you with a meal that won't be forgotten.  Joon blew us away with amazing attention to detail. The fish he used literally fell apart in our mouths before we even started to chew and the flavorful combinations this 15 year veteran delivered to us were nothing short of daring and delicious. If you have the budget for it, I would highly recommend that you try Omakase from Joon, you won't regret it and I'm positive it isn't the last time I will do so either. (Oh and don't forget to tip your chef with some Mu Sake after the meal!)   Bravo."}
{"text":"Being from LA, we have amazing sushi bars. This one really blew me away!  It's off the beaten path from the strip, in a quiet mini mall. This was recommended by a local. Totally worth the trip out here from our hotel in vegas. Came here with a large group on a Monday night. Easy to get a table. It was fantastic. Quality of the seafood is great. And especailly great for an all you can eat sushi bar! Much better quality than the best buffets on the strip. The service was stellar. Manager Geo and server Mark made sure we were all taken care of!   There are rules to the all you can eat sushi, so you need to plan well to get a nice variety of sushi. You need to finish all your sushi, or they will charge you, so don't over order. Even if you get a few rolls, it's totally worth it. You even get an amazing dessert. I recommend the tempura banana!   If I lived here, I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday with our granddaughter, Ordered 2 mild Korean ramen & 2 miso ramen! Korean ramen came out but waited 20 mins for miso ramen until the waitresses asked if we were waiting for something! We said yes 2 miso saimin. The waitresses went to check and said the person who took our order put in miso soup! Well we never got any miso soup so that was a lot of bull!   The guy who took our order came and said it will be 5 minutes, they thought it was miso soup and walked away. I grumbled and said well I never got any miso soup if that's the case!!   Finally, got our ramen!! Delicious but not as tasty if I got it when everyone got their food!"}
{"text":"It's rare to find a good quality AYCE sushi restaurant that includes sashimi. Sure certain restaurants (starts with a T ends with odai and the other place starts with an M and ends with akino) serve AYCE sushi and sashimi but the quality's poor.  Although there's a limit to how much sashimi you can order at Sushi Wa, you're guaranteed to have fresh fish that looks and tastes superb. It's a 20+ miles away from where I love but it's worth it. The interior is clean and modern. The servers are great too."}
{"text":"I would eat Miso Soup, Sushi, and Mochi everyday if I could afford it.  When I can afford it I go to Sushi Wa for lunch or dinner.  The Sushi is delicous and fresh and the service is wonderful.  I have been to this spot six times in the past year and everytime I go it seems like the staff wait on me and my friends hand and foot.  My glass is never dry and they keep the green tea coming.  I love the salmon mango roll!  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  The all you can eat includes soup, salad, and dessert.  Yumm-O!  Check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because I have been craving sushi after passing on a trip with all the Yelpers. It has been some time since I came here, but it is close to home and I remembered liking this place a lot. A couple of years later, it is still good and they have AYCE. I sat down at the bar and did the AYCE lunch ($21.95) The restaurant was quiet, at noon, since they open at 11:30. Not too long after 1pm, people started to come in. That gave me a 45 minutes of my own personal sushi chef. I got the Spicy Sashimi Salad to start. It was light on the dressing, not too spicy, and overall delicious. It could use more heat, but the mound of greens, diakon, and seaweed was a plus. The Agedashi Tofu  had an odd taste or maybe too much flavor. I usually drink all the broth, but I left mine this time. The Shrimp and Sweet Potato Tempura was good. Spears of sweet potato were wrapped in shrimp, lightly battered, and fried. Simply perfect. I also like their Monkey Brains appetizer. Spicy tuna, cream cheese, shitake mushroom which they fry up tempura style before cutting into quarters and placed on their spicy and eel sauce.   All of the nigiri I got were good, but nothing mind blowing in flavor. I do like the attention to detail though. My Ika came out looking like a baby squid. The Unagi was also better because they took a torch to it after putting on the sauce to give a nice char. Sang has some nice knife skills.  I am a sucker for a Screaming Orgasm and must try it anywhere I go. I know saying I like their orgasm sauce because it is not too creamy is going to set me up for a razzing, but I don't care. It is true, because the sauce is more on the citrus side than on the mayo and I am fan. I finished my sushi course with a half order of this roll. I wished I saved more room or asked if I could get it as a salad, because it was my favorite. Ordering a half roll is like declaring a cease fire. Once the white flag is up, there is no more sushi to be had. Make sure you are ready to call it quits before asking for this. The chefs are upfront about it, but just a warning in case it slips their minds.  At the end of my meal, I got the banana tempura with green tea ice cream. I don't normally order tempura items at Japanese restaurants, but Sushi Wa does it so well.   The service was polite, attentive, and quick on refills of my green tea and water. I had an enjoyable lunch. There can be a wait if they get hit with too many eager AYCE diners, but patience is rewarded."}
{"text":"I love the sushi bombs! My husband and I usually go there after work at around 12am. The service is alright but the food is really good !"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood, attentive staff, and a nice physical layout.   First time visit for AYCE lunch. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The venue was located in a fairly large plaza which made parking easy. My first impression as I walked in was that the interior design was a little on the conservative side and that the seating layout was odd. There was quite a bit of wasted space which meant longer wait times if it got busy.   Despite its lack-luster name, quality was actually quite decent. There was definitely no \"wow\" factor to the food, but what really stood out was the service. The owner, Joseph, took the time to come greet me at the table and struck up some small talk. This place was owned by Koreans and served both Japanese and Korean dishes.   The seafood was fresh and presentation was better than a lot of other sushi places I have been to. Selections are also reasonably priced.  Verdict:  If you're in the area and looking for a decent sushi place, definitely pay \"Sushi WA\" a visit. The owner there puts in a lot of effort in running his business and it shows through the quality of food and service. I will definitely be visiting again..."}
{"text":"I found this place about a year ago and it is the best sushi I have had in Vegas, which I know is a biiiiiiig statement.   Over the past 10 years or so I have eaten at dozens of sushi restaurants in this town (on the strip as well) and I can't say I have enjoyed any as much as this place. The fish is stellar, the customer service is amazing, and the rolls are innovative and flavorful.  What brought me back is the fact that I can easily eat $100 worth of sushi in one sitting. I prefer all-yo-can-eat venues because frankly, it's cheaper. Most of the time you find yourself at one of these places, the rolls are basic and not very good, or you are prohibited from ordering any of the \"good\" rolls. Not this place!!! If it is on the menu, you can order it (and as much as you like). Any app, roll, sashimi, nigiri; it's all fair game. The funny thing is the place is almost always empty! It's a really nice place right next door to Shakespeare's (a trendy bar). I am positive that this is just a secret among those who live in Green Valley. This place is a must-go for any Vegas sushi-addict."}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Wa and probably my last.   Nothing was terribly wrong, but it just wasnt that impressive. The interior is very nice. We almost felt a bit out of place in flip flops. The service was fine, though there were a few odd moments and they forgot to bring a few things. I ended up ordering the AYCE sushi, not because I was that hungry, but because the individual roll prices are so high (most around $13) that you have already hit the AYCE price once you have ordered two. I found the roll selection pretty much standard with a few surprises, but there was something off with all the things I ordered. I couldnt tell quite what it was, but I have a feeling the fish wasnt the freshest. There was that slightly bitter aftertaste that you get from fish that has been sitting around just a little too long.  Overall Sushi Wa was decent, but there are several other better AYCE places around town that I would prefer to spend $26."}
{"text":"So good, highly recommend enjoying ayce sushi and sake here. Thank you Jenny for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the sushi. Quality of fish was great. The rolls were a good size and actually gave a decent amount of fillings. We ordered the small sushi/sashimi platter (which included a good assortment of nigiri/sashimi, but I was not a huge fan of the crab rolls, which made up a good portion of the platter) and a bunch of other rolls. Quality was excellent all around. The only downsides were:  1. They could not accept a credit card over the phone. Considering we had someone else picking up the food, that wasn't ideal. Also, when they forgot to include our order of edamame, they were not able to refund the difference to the card and instead had to issue a credit for our next visit (again not ideal,  as we live downtown and were uptown to visit family).  2. The nigiri pieces I thought were very small. Delicious, but very small.   Otherwise, no other complaints and would gladly be coming here more often if I lived closer."}
{"text":"The Chirashi was off the hook! What a work of art... A+ for presentation, fresh fish, and good serving size. Something out the ordinary... it even had a few slices of what I think what super white tuna topped with some black roe. Delicious!   A+ for ambiance, service, and good prices.... And opens late.  Oh another plus... there is a U-Swirl self serve yogurt place right next door. Sorry Sushi Wa, I'm sure your fried green tea ice cream and mochi balls are probably delicious, but you can't beat 30-something cents an ounce of yogurt + toppings next door! =)"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but now its going down in quality.  They redo the menu so a lot of items that used to be able to get with AYCE arent available but instead in a la carte.  Every time I go in there now there's new staffs working specially sushi chefs.  The sushi rolls used to be so good but now it tastes so bland. Im feeling like I was eating at Sushi Mon. I will give it one more chance. If it still terrible I will have to change place. It sucks because I've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa isn't the top option for AYCE but they're good enough to get regular visits. We can always walk right in when our go-to spot is busy. The sushi is consistent as is the service for us.  With plenty of seating, including some high back booths for privacy, there is rarely a wait here. On busy nights, they'll have two to three servers running the floor with male manager/owner that's doing all the seating, running food, and helping out with take out. I've noticed two servers that are consistently there, with frequent turnover with the other servers which may lead to an occasional inconsistency with service depending on who is there.  The AYCE menu is pretty standard with your regular lineup of nigiri and hot apps. Some of the hot tapas aren't that impressive such as the soft shell crab and pork belly and I would suggest you steer clear of to save room for sushi. I usually don't make it to the rolls, but when I'm there with friends the do prefer rolls, they have decent list of interesting and unique ones. For the non sushi eaters, the bento boxes are a good value with Korean BBQ short ribs being the favorite of my wife.  Pricing is $23/$27 for lunch/dinner with super late hours for the night owls. Some people get their panties all bunched up over non Japanese owned sushi joints. But for me, you can come from Mars and have an extra arm coming out of the top of your head, as long as you can make sushi rice and can place a fresh piece of fish neatly on top of it, I'm a fan and you'll get my business."}
{"text":"Diverse selection of sushi, rolls, and cooked food. The AYCE is also reasonably priced and decor is nicer than most other sushi places."}
{"text":"Walking into the place, it looked nice. Sitting down, the bench was very comfortable. Service was ok. I ordered the Korean spicy ramen combo with a spider roll. The spider roll had eel sauce on it and a carrots inside which made it weird. The other people in my group had ordered sushi also and they didn't care for what they ordered. One person ordered a tempura roll which she thought would be a roll with tempura in it. Nope, it was a roll made tempura style. The ramen I ordered was a little disappointing. I'm sure I'm wrong but it just seemed like top ramen noodles with some added stuff to it. We wanted to come back and try the all you can eat but after experiencing some of the food they served we all agreed that we would t be coming back. Some people might like the sushi here but it was such a departure from the norm that I just didn't like it."}
{"text":"The dinner bento is good price.  I will totally recommend the tempura, sushi and sashimi bento. It's $16.99, big portion of food. The owner is super super nice and kind.  He usually will come say hi to new customer and offer free ice cream. =P The ice-cream is not just scoop of ice cream. It's ice cream with corn flakes and taste good together."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was ehh. We won't be returning or recommending.  We get there when the place first opened, and upon walking in I'm thinking that because it looks nice, we'll probably have a really good experience here. Yeah, not so much.  It took the waitress a few minutes to acknowledge us after she gave us the menu to get our drink orders. Upon returning to take our order, there's like 30 thousand rules that are already listed in the menu, but the waitress decided she had to make sure we knew. I know that with AYCE sushi, you're supposed to finish your food or they say they will charge you so that people don't just order a bunch of stuff to waste. So when we're ordering the waitress made sure to tell us we needed to finish all of our food eor we would be charged.   Another issue we had was when we tried to order, everything we wanted, like plain roll were on the dinner menu. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying dinner price for AYCE sushi during dinner, but it was lunch. This lunch ended up costing 70 bucks with tip.    The food was meager. The sashimi was good, but nothing spectacular. The screaming orgasm was really good along with the peppered tuna. Philadelphia roll was very plain. The shrimp tempura roll my bf said tasted \"super fishy.\" The Japanese lasagna was delicious.  Cucumber salad was bland. Ice cream was ice cream.  The waitress did, however, keep refilling my bf's soda without having to be asked. Which was nice. Usually, drinks are ignored. Here, it wasn't.  This place is very close to home, so we were hoping we could find another neighborhood favorite, but I guess it's back to SushiMon."}
{"text":"GREAT sushi, atmosphere and okay service.   They aren't too busy normally which is a blessing and a curse because they only have one or two servers at a time so the wait can be longer than normal places but the menu and sushi is amazing."}
{"text":"Very good. Delicious and not stingy w fish or anything. Cold beers and frozen mochi. We enjoyed the attentive waitress who asked us as the plates were 70% gone about our next orders and not stingy w the plates and numbers of rolls. We will be back for more next time in vegas."}
{"text":"It was terrible. Staff ignored us apon entering. Just looked up and went back to ckeaning tables. Finally sat down.  Took forever to even get a drink. Food was blah. Will not return."}
{"text":"My husband & I go here twice a month for all-you-can-eat sushi.  The food is fresh, the presentation is beautiful, and the service is awesome!  My husband can drink enough ice tea to kill a camel, and he always has a full glass.  When we order food, it comes quickly, and we are always asked what else we would like.   We always sit at the bar which is very clean and inviting.  The sushi chef's are friendly and  entertaining. While other sushi bars come and go, there is a reason that this sushi place has been around for years!!"}
{"text":"So everyone seems to love to this place and I was wondering why it got 5 stars. Definitely not worth going!!!! Yes, this CAT got tricked!!  The restaurant is very small. It won't fit more than a party of 8-10 in one area. Other than that, it's good for couples. No much decor. It felt old.   The worst part is that the waitress had to apologize and tell us that she's the only one working, so indeed, the service was very slow!!!!! And I was hungry too!!!  Happy:  There were 2 free appetizers which I found out from other yelpers. One is a tiny roll of veggies and mango which was nicely presented. It was followed by a warm tuna roll which had a nice spicy sauce on it which was delicious. A crunch to it too!!   Now after that... it went downhill....  Unhappy:  The miso soup and salad that was supposed to come with it didn't come early so we can eat that while we were hungry. The soup came with our meal and it definitely took longer than any Japanese place that I've been to!! My partner ordered chicken katsu which was alright. I ordered teriyaki salmon which was 2 dried up pieces. It was overcooked. I had to remind the waitress if there was a salad and she said YES and then explained that she was the only one working there. Well, it's obvious they need to hire another one during the weekend.   We also didn't get the same napkins as the other tables. We got the cheap ones that are see-through!! We saw people that came in and walked out since there were no tables available. I wanted to tell them that they might be too hungry to even move if they receive their food.   It was quicker to pay at the tilt instead of asking for the bill.   Verdict:  It was too long a drive to get there and it was not worth it. Not worth it at all. Not sure why people are rating it so high. It doesn't deserve it at all. Sorry. Even if the food was good, I wouldn't wait over 30 minutes for my meal - at a Japanese place!"}
{"text":"I don't say this often (sad to say because a friend of mine swears this is the best Sushi place now in the Las Vegas area), but this is the worse sushi buffet/place I have ever been to. Maybe it was because it was lunch time, but everything stunk!  First of all, there are limitations to the buffet, like one of each poke salad, dessert, etc. In addition, uni, sweet shrimp, oysters were only offered at dinner time. They also don't have sashimi for lunch time. After seeing this, I had a second thought of maybe leaving because my hubby already had several things marked off of his \"must-have\" list at a sushi place, but I decided to stay.  After ordering a few sushi/nigiri, the waitress asked us if we were \"sure\" we wanted to order all of this because there was 16 pieces for the both of us. Keep in mind, we haven't even started eating yet. Ok, I guess she doesn't get customers that eat a lot of sushi?  Again, we just brushed it off, and said we still wanted it.  When we got our sushi, I was disgusted. The raw fish was breaking apart already (most likely 2-3 days old), wasn't as cold, and the rice also wasn't as sticky. Ewwww! Gross.   The best part of the lunch was probably the mochi, and the banana tempura with green tea ice cream dessert I had them make for me.  Don't go here unless you really have to."}
{"text":"So far one of the nicest looking \"all you can eat sushi\" places i have been. And better yet the staff are all amazing, even going so far as to create custom rolls for us. Will definitely come again and bring my family again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fresh sushi, with impressive presentation.  The restraunt is very clean and well decorated.  We had the all you can eat and were very happy with everything"}
{"text":"Looking for a new AYCE sushi and found this place.  Got seated right away, however, we were told that they had a lot of reservations so seating was limited.  Ordered our appetizers and first entrees.  Once the food started coming to the table, it all came at a nice pace.  Rolls were a bit loose, and tended to fall apart easily.  They were a bit large in portion as well, which makes it hard to eat.  They restrict how much of certain items you can have for each person and when we tried to order the Uni and was told they were out.  Service was very good, constantly clearing the dishes and taking orders for next course.  Overall, very good atmosphere, great service, good food.  No complaints.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Came on a Saturday for dinner. Server was very pleasant. Complimentary edamame and vermicelli soup.  A cozy sushi restaurant. Ordered the Red Dragon roll and Geisha roll alongside the sushi/sashimi/tempura bento box and chigurashi. The specialty rolls were so delicious! Very big and very little rice in them.  At the end, Chef Joseph came by our table to ask how everything was. He also asked for our names and gave complimentary ice cream. What a great personal touch. Also, after leaving I thought I left my glove in the restaurant. When I came back in, both the server and Chef Joseph helped me to look for it in the booth. Lovely place with great food and great customer service. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just had since of the best sushi I've ever had. This is my third time here and I've liked it, but today it was perfect. Unbelievably fresh and nice size pieces of fish.. Definitely got my money's worth.. Highly recommend.. Juan was amazing. Great service and his sushi Skills are on point. Will definitely be back. Again and again.."}
{"text":"Sushi Wa is a great neighborhood sushi restaurant .  The freshness and quality of the sushi and sashimi is consistent .  The service is warm and courteous , and the fusion sauces are delectable ! Cannot beat it for quality , variety and price ."}
{"text":"No. WE ARE NOT GOING TO EAT HERE. First, we called the restaurant today 04/08 at around 12:15 and we spoke to a girl to ask questions for takeout and she doesn't even know what kind of food they have and she said SHE WAS BUSY. So we went to the restaurant and there's only one server (who answers the phone as well) and approached her if we could order for takeout. 30 minutes later, my husband was waving at her to order as there are only 3 tables so we thought itll be okay to already order as it was more than 30 minutes wait time. The server said, \"Sorry I'm busy\". So my husband told her \"if you couldnt take my order, let me know so I could already walk out.\" We then left very disappointed.  So we understand that she was by herself taking all orders, taking the food and dishing out. But at least acknowledge the PEOPLE who comes to your restaurant. Despite the good reviews that you guys have, WE ARE NOT GOING TO TRY IT AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND to anyone due to the fact that the service was horrible.  To whoever that server was (on 04/08, 1am), we really hope the management could read this and fire you. The restaurant doesn't deserve you."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!! AYCE is a must.  The \"Salmon Crunch\" is the best.  The Garlic Tuna is superb. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was one of the places my now husband brought me to on one of our first dates. 5 years later we are still coming here regularly.  I recommended Sushi Wa often .   The ayc an eat menu is large and the service is awesome. No waiting around for your next roll. My favorite...the Superman Burrito"}
{"text":"Food 5 Stars - Service 3 stars.  We went on New Years Eve, and the restaurant was crowded... but not that crowded.  We had a reservation for 7 - they put us in a cramped rounded booth - maybe room for 5-6.  One server asked us for drinks, and then no one came to get our order... ten minutes later we asked the drink server, about ordering, and he said he wasnt' our server and left.  Finally after getting the managers attention, we got a server.   Anyway - seemed like we were an inconvenience to the manager.  She didn't smile once- looked irritated at everyone the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"It's my go to place if I'm in the mood for sushi! All you can eat for a great price, fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fish, the staff is friendly, helpful and the restaurant is clean with a great vibe. The desserts are incredible.The only thing I would change is adding more items to the menu for those who come in a group and would like something other than sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi and an even better server Jenny. Food came out right away and can't pass up a free beer!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!!!! Some of the best freshest fish I've had. The monkey brain is great. It sounds weird but trust me it's the best. Very classy and clean inside. The service is great. Hands down my favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite sushi places in Henderson.  Great service, food, and sake selection.  Would highly recommend to anyone!!!  A++++++"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to come here! I came with 2 friends and only one of them had ayce sushi with me. The other friend ordered a la carte.   Upon entry, our waitresses were nice and friendly. It was a good start. Ambiance is nice and quiet, but dark inside. If you're like me and really love to take pictures of food it'll be hard without flash cause it's very dim in here.   We got served by 3 different servers. The waitress taking our order had issues with her pen not working twice and it felt slow. We were told we were not able to order half rolls unless it's for our last orders. Weird.   Ice cream is only limited to one kind per person. So if you want both the tempura and mochi ice cream, you can only pick one. :( Sad face here.   We ended with a waiter named JooSun (spelling?) and he seemed distant/apathetic but he was also nice. He let my a la carte friend get ice cream anyway. He gave me this bonus card when I asked for the stamp cards.. not sure if they have those stamp cards now. I'll find out soon enough.   All in all, it was a pretty good experience. There was this halibut that I tried which I could not for the life of me finish it nor swallow it. :(  Next time I'm back would most likely be in June for a birthday celebration. I'll update then. :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over a year and I honestly feel like this is one of the best sushi bars in vegas! Ayce sushi usually means a little bite of fish on a huge chunk of rice but not here. The fish is usually ample and so amazingly fresh! My favorites have to be the salmon and garlic tuna! They also have a great selection of rolls that do not leave you wishing you had gone somewhere else. The superman roll is by far my most favorite roll of the restaurant then the screaming o roll! Those two rolls are what keep me coming back time and time again! So if I were to rate this place on just the quality of the sushi and the rolls it would definitely be a 5 star place but unfortunately there's another part to the stars which is service. The wait staff is awesome some are more attentive then others but generally they all make yoy feel welcome and treat you well and keep your drinks filled up the sushi chefs though are not all wonderful! I feel as though sushi chefs should be personable and care about the people they are serving which I do believe two of them do but there is one sushi chef ( I think his name is danny) (I could be wrong) he is scary and he makes you feel bad for ordering more stuff and even though he's speaking in Japanese you can tell he's complaining about all the people who are there to eat or what they are ordering. He does alot of huffing and puffing and eye rolling sighing and complaining. It's horrible and every time I walk in and see him behind the bar I give a quick prayer that I don't have to sit in front of him or that he's not the main sushi chef for the night cause he makes the other chefs grumpy also. So food is amazing, prices are average for ayce in vegas and the service is great if you don't get the one chef that can make your night rough."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi in Las Vegas.  The fish quality is high and the selection is great.  Each AYCE order also includes one order of sashimi.  The seared peppered tuna is my favorite, but I have yet to have something that I didn't like."}
{"text":"I am from New York City and my mother took me to eat here and it was great place small but very good clean and fresh sushi loved it !!"}
{"text":"Best soft shell crab tempura! Great service, great sake, and close to home.   We've been here a few times now, and have tried a variety of items on the menu. With the exception of one or two we didn't personally have a taste for, we've never had an issue. Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"I wish I could undo that meal selection.  Decor, music and plating of the meal were excellent  Service, freshness of fish, and pricing were good.  Here is where they disappoint.  The amount of rice they pack into the Nigiri sushi. I'm not one to fuss about eating the rice. I enjoy it quite a bit but this place over did it.  Some of the sauces were terrible and do not belong on the Nigiri that I was ordering.   The jalapeños on my sushi were dark forest green, pickled and cut to the same diameter as the canned ones you put on a ball park hot dog. Gross!    This was the worst sushi I've had in town.   This place could be excellent if they would just use proper recipes and ingredients."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places we've been to. Food is very fresh and the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"I swear to never return at this sushi restaurant anbf please customers who intend to come here to dine PLEASE READ THE FINE PRINT and make your you order only as much as you can eat and clean off your plates completely to the last piece with exactly nothing left on any single plate.   My server/waitress had not taken my order correctly and did not admit to her mistake. I told her many times and had asked her please do not put Tuna in the many assorted fishes in my roll of sushi and she said oh yes the chef will simply just out more of one of the other kinds of fish. That seems like it was ordered easily and understood. Then she had mentioned many of the other dishes and rolls I had ordered alsoi had tuna but they were spicy tuna...They were different because they are slightly cooked and not if the same texture I said those are Ok. I'm fine with those. So then when the meal came to the table I told them the order was,taken wrong they admitted fault and asked if they could make a new one we said no we didn't want to order a new one because we were full already. Then when time came to pay they said those were considered left overs. They wanted to charge as left overs.   How ridiculous? Also ayce is only allowing 1sashimi per person. That's really not ayce  then.   There are so many restrictions for the price we pay. They expect us to eat sushi with the fish so that we get full quick. What a scam.   They want to charge if there is even 1piece of food left on a plate. How ridiculous.  This us what management had told me when I needed to speak with manager because he wanted to back up his worker.    This restaurant does not know how to guide the customer on ordering the right things on the menus and letting customers know the rules in the restaurant. Don't assume the customers know they have to clean the plates.   Buffets ayce don't expect people to eat everything off there plates.   You ridiculous restaurant.  Frozen Salmon.  Not so fresh salads. Seasoning is so spicy Mayonaise is so sour. How can you expect us to eat all if the food is not great.  Please get better chefs."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to eat sushi.. also take out. Customer service is always great and very friendly to their guest. My family and friends come here frequently for takeout and never disappoint. They give us the Korean style noodles while waiting for takeout."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to. Great service, amazing food.. They are All you can eat  but food quality is better than A la carte.  For the sushi lover this place is a  must try!!"}
{"text":"Holy hell...everything seemed fine, OK sushi, no bad...but not great, until we saw the ROACHES.  I kid you not.  When someone at the other end of the sushi bar said that they saw a bug, both my dining partner and myself tried to put it out of our minds.  BAD MOVE.  We continued to order and eat, only to have a small brown roach crawl right in front of us, on the sushi bar.  When we wigged out and pushed away from the counter, I happened to look down and saw another one at my feet.  Crap on a cracker...I was GROSSED OUT.  The worst part??? The waitress wasn't even freaked out by it....she simply walked over and went after them with a napkin....like she deals with it all of the time.  Googly moogly.  They took 30% off of the check (really????), which we didn't even ask them to, we'd have paid full price...we just wanted to leave.  I didn't know upon leaving what I wanted to do more...throw up or shower.  Super disappointing because the place looks elegant and clean.  Nasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! Beautiful decor on the inside & out. Once you walk in, you are completely shocked that it is so elegant, but yet comfortable for dining. Sat at the bar, and our order was taken right away. Drinks were always refilled, and food came out in a perfect time. So stuffed from the delicious food, & prices were great too. Terrific customer service. Chef JJ told me he liked my glasses, too funny! Definitely going to go back! Probably in my top 3 favorite sushi restaurants. & please tip these guys, they do such an amazing job."}
{"text":"Wow, we went as a party of 6 today. The food was good but the service ruined our experience. I have no idea how they have 4 stars!  The waitress was not helpful, nice or attentive to our needs. I understand you already know that you're getting an 18% auto gratuity but it does not create cause for bad service. We like to eat a lot and it means 3 or 4 rounds of ordering. We had to keep flagging the servers to put in additional orders. She didn't ask how we wanted to split the bill or provide eye contact as we were hoping to get another dessert round since it wasn't limited.   The meal was $28 each for AYCE which some items were included and others not. I really liked the nigiri and sashimi as well as the other dishes but it's not enough in a service based city.  We will not be coming back to Sushi Wa or recommending it to anyone. The location had a trendy look and feel when you walk in. Music was loud playing with hip hop music, it was a low lighting environment and the part that bothered someone in our party was that we were told to put the menus on the floor for more table space which means dirty menus in our hands."}
{"text":"We lived in Okinawa, Japan for 8 years and, after moving back to the US, missed the great sushi, tempura, etc. and friendly people.  After moving to Vegas in June, we found Sushi Wa and were excited to find the best Japanese restaurant since we moved back to the US!  All their food was PHENOMENAL ('Oishi' - if that's how you spell it in English) and the people were extremely welcoming.  While it's not close to where we live in Vegas, it's worth the trip for the great food, people and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago, and remembered having a pleasant experience. But, even though I faintly remembered much about it - the salmon sushi left a lasting impression. I came back today, and was pleasantly surprised. When I asked our server why the salmon was so unique and fresh, she said the owner imports fresh every day! Extremely rare for Vegas, as we aren't near the ocean, most sushi restaurants are frozen and costly.   Whereas the AYCE closely resembles Sushi Mon, with fresher fish and closely detailed presentation and flavor. Definitely worth the price, with Kabuki sized salmon sushi that tastes even fresher."}
{"text":"Came here for a Meetup event with the I Love Sushi group.  We had a fairly large party, and we ended up placing a huge order right from the start as every one was marking down what they want on the order sheet without much group coordination. We were warned about not ordering too much, but as a group we failed to heed the manager's warning.  So a lot of food was prepared and served almost on top of each other.  Anyway, at the end of the meal Chef Joon (owner) came to speak to us, and said that they do their best to make the best food they can for the customers, but when they get a huge order they will rush it and may not be able to put as much attention as they normally would like, so it is better to order slowly for the best food.  Plus they do not skim for their AYCE customers, and the rolls were larger than we were accustomed to at AYCE sushi restaurants.  The restaurant itself was beautiful.  You can tell someone invested a lot of time and other resources into the design and the final look of the restaurant.  It is very modern and artistic look to it, which pairs well with the beautiful food served.  The lighting is fairly bright, so you can enjoy the food visually before savoring it with your other senses. Plus it almost feels like you are eating in a modern art museum, or a restaurant within one, since it is roomy!!! and you are not crammed in there like 7 Vienna Sausages in a can.   We ordered a wide range of items from their AYCE menu, which is practically their entire menu (with some exclusions).  Below are the highlights and my personal recommendations:  APPETIZERS:  Monkey Brain (basically spicy tuna and cream cheese stuffed in mushroom and tempura fried) - small enough to eat solo or share with up to 4 ppl. Soft Shell Crab - Tempura fried and delicious. Served san rice makes it even better (more room in the tummy for other awesome food, plus it is low carbs!)  SALADS: Tuna Poki Salad - good portions.  ROLLS: Crunch Albacore - looks good, and tastes great. Mango Salmon Roll - sweetness from the mango just pairs well with the salmon. Energy Roll - one of the deep fried rolls, great flavor, especially if you like unagi (eel). Tiger Roll - They make a good version of this popular roll.  NIGIRI: Uni, Super White Tuna, Ama Ebi were all good and they do not skimp on these just because you ordered AYCE, so you get a nice proportion of fish to rice. And most importantly the fish were fresh! Pepper Seared Baby Tuna - big fan of this!  HONORABLE MENTION: Superman Burrito (Shrimp Tempura, Soft shell Crab, Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail with special spicy Garlic sauce) - it is a ginormous roll, be sure to bring a lot of hungry friends, or you will not get to try too many other items on the menu.  Sushi Wa offers lunch specials and 1/2 price sushi menu offers from 11:30am-3pm and dinner specials from 6-9pm, which you can check out on their website. http://www.sushiwavegas.com/menus.html  If you live near here, be sure to get their frequent visitor/loyalty card.  In hindsight I should have picked up one of these, as I am going back to Sushi Wa next week.  The staff here are nice, and checks up on their guests frequently.  Our drinks were frequently refilled.  And as I have mentioned earlier, Chef Joon (the owner) even came and spoke to us at the end of our meal.    The restaurant is located in the SE part of Las Vegas (Henderson), where there are also a lot of other really good AYCE Sushi restaurants nearby and unfortunately for me a little far (by Vegas standards), but I think it is worth the drive or if you happen to be in the area.  Decor: 5/5 I love the look of the restaurant. Ambiance: 4.5/5  Very nice Food: 4/5  I found some favorites already, while others I am glad that I have tried and will likely pass up in order to try other items. Service: 4/5  Good. Location: Worth checking out if you have your own transportation for out of town visitors.  Otherwise cab fare will be more than the price of the meal.  Solid 4 stars.  Plus it is still a hidden gem (even though they have been open for a few years already), as you don't have to wait a long time for seats compared to some other well-known AYCE sushi restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Sushi Wa whenever we need to grab some late dinner. The owner and the staff are very friendly. The food is consistently great and they provide delicious samples of sushi and occasionally dessert :) The hospitality is simply amazing.  A must try for any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"Good, but just not worth it!  The sushi was good... No doubts about that, and the portions were filing. Anything fried was huge. The stuffed jalapeño was delicious. The Las Vegas Roll was good, except the rice was on the outside. I am not a fan of this. I think makes the roll taste too much like fried dough rather rice than sushi, which would be fine, except these aren't carnival prices.  At $26.95 for dinner AYCE, that is slight more than many other sushi places in Las Vegas.. And the sake was $10 for a large. That is crazy. Minus one star there.  Oh, and the $10 sake was not even hot, but warm. Minus one more star!  The service here was good, but when we asked for a table in the corner the hostess/waitress asked why... How about you just do as we requested? Most of the tables were not occupied, only a few were."}
{"text":"Amazing interior design, and a welcoming warm atmosphere. Fish is professionally prepared and great presentation. Staff is friendly and patient. Shout out to server Jenny, she is a champion! #amazing #jennyisachamp"}
{"text":"My new favorite place.  I have always loved I Love Sushi and still do but the atmosphere was 10 times better and the food was great you have to try the Who's Your Daddy appetizer and all of the rolls we had were great."}
{"text":"Awesome Food , Best Sushi I have had in Las Vegas. Staff is great! Love the owner! We are definitely regulars here!"}
