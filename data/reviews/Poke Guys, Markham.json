{"text":"Must Try: A Hui Hou Bowl or Cali Bowl (with brown rice)

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Personally one of my favourite Poke spots (their first being off Dundas), of all the various ones that have opened up around the city these last few years. It's easy to order, with just enough customization to make it your own, but not so much that it's an unbearable mission to make a bowl.

They offer a large portion with delicious sauce & flavours, with poke that is always fresh. Personally always go between the Cali Bowl and Hui Hou, as the fish and toppings are perfect for me. It is also a great value, being reasonably priced for the portions you get. 

The new location is clean, with plenty of seating for dining in. The service is always friendly and very helpful with first time customers. They also have take out via DoorDash for those wanted their poke, but feeling like staying in."}
{"text":"Glad to have a close by Poke spot in Markham; however, I think that they could be more competitive. It's a small location that sits about 17 people; however, during the weekday it wasn't that busy and it was quite easy to find a spot. 

I wasn't a big fan of how they priced their bowls. Unlike most Poke places, they charge you for ALL toppings (.85), and then they charge you even more for premium (1.25). That being said, their base pricing seems to be a bit lower than competitors at 10.25 for Build Your Own and 11.25 for a Signature. But I would honestly prefer that they just charge $12 and make toppings unlimited. The signature bowls can be a better deal if you're planning on getting only 1-2 toppings. For example, I got the Cali bowl, which came with Salmon and Tuna (which costs +$1 on the build your own), crab meat slaw (+$1.25) and avocado ($1) and would have cost $14.5 in contrast to 11.25 since it was a signature. 

Garnishes, in contrast, are actually free - so basically, the fried onions. For the dressing I got the Togorashi and Me so sesame (mayo based) with my bowl and enjoyed the sauces. 

Also, it was around 1pm on a weekday when I went, and they ran out of salad for the base (?!).

That being said, I really enjoyed my bowl and thought it tasted pretty good. The ratio of fish to bowl was good as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I really like it here. It's a smaller space so it can get a bit crowded during busier peak times with limited seats but the poke bowls are good and the ingredients are fresh.  Topping choices are plentiful. Employees are super nice and approachable. They're also generous with the raw fish bits. 

Parking is limited outside but there is commercial parking in the underground lot behind the joint, you just have to drive into the cluster of condos. I didn't notice it the first time but I realized the second time that the parking is there and shared among the buildings and businesses. Don't park in residential or visitor though (I am positive you'll get ticketed because security looks tighter in this lot), park in the area for commercial instead as they have three separate zones."}
{"text":"Been to the downtown location once and really enjoyed it so I am glad that they opened up a location now in Markham much closer to home for me. 

My friend and I came here last week during their soft opening and they only accepted cash since they haven't install their debit/credit machine yet. Tbh, that was a bit of an inconvenience but luckily I bank with TD and it was just right around the corner. It was hard to find street parking during the day as their was a 20 minutes time limit. I resulted in parking by the carousel but mind you, that lot is also small (limited parking spots). My friend told me there was underground parking within the condo but I am not sure since I didn't bother trying looking for the entrance. Worst case scenario, you can always park across the street where Goodlife, Theatre, etc. and just walk over.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staffs. We came right when store open so they were still getting everything ready. Menu options were either build your own poke bowl or choose one of their signature ones. I decided to build my own so that way I know for sure I won't waste any toppings that I won't enjoy. I don't remember the price exactly but it was around $10 for customizing and each topping was almost $1 so it does add up. I remember my bowl after tax was $13 and change which wasn't bad. My poke included brown rice, spicy salmon, avocado, masago, seaweed, zucchini/cucumbers, fried garlic, sesame, and spicy aioli sauce. I like that the bowl was a decent amount, ingredients were fresh, and they were generous with toppings. 

The place is small so not a lot of seatings but it's definitely a quick in and out spot and I noticed most people do take out. Overall, enjoyed my experience and looking forward to coming back more often since it's very close to home."}
{"text":"I thought Komeya was my favourite place for poke in Markham but this place beats it by far. Yes pricey (i paid 30$ for 2 regular bowls) , but worth it. They have a great selection of ingredients and an option to build your own bowl or to have one of their pre-selected signature bowls which are more expensive by 2$. There is also a certain charge for select ingredients like seaweed salad or crab meat on the bowls (1-2$). If you get a signature bowl adding some toppings is 25 cents each. 
Regular bowls are an excellent size- my boyfriend and I couldn't even finish one. The service was also friendly and it is a very clean place. 
4 stars for the price and because this is the first poke place where my avocado was served kind of brown and squished together. I would still recommend and come back if I'm willing to splurge a little that day."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great taste. They have very limited sitting area so you might want to consider take out."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Poke scene in Markham! Amongst the ever developing Downtown, it was kinda hard to find nearby parking other than the 20 minute spaces on the street. Having ordered the Cali Bowl, I was happy to find a sufficient amount of both tuna and salmon poke. I was also happy to find that I could opt for brown rice free of charge! There are lots of toppings to choose from to add on for 85 cents each, which I thought was reasonable. Overall, a nice addition to Downtown Markham for some reasonably priced and quality poke bowls!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is average.  Price is a bit steep.  
Parking situation is bad!  

I like the food.  I just hope they are located somewhere with a proper parking lot.  The street parking is only for 20 mins so if there is a line-up then you are screwed.  And I am not sure if you are supposed to park at the carousel.  I don't want to get a ticket for buying my lunch/dinner.  And the condo parking is too much trouble.  I don't think I will be back due to the parking situation."}
{"text":"This place is no joke. Well.. getting here if you're driving north on Birchmount kind of is, but the place itself is GREAT. 

A couple of coworkers wanted to go out for lunch and we decided to check this spot out. It's super close to the office, and it was a good choice on a hot day.

The place is small, with seating for maybe 20-30 people in the whole place. The service is super friendly and everything looked (and tasted) fresh. As per usual, my eyes were way bigger than my stomach and I ordered the large PG bowl, which is easily enough for 2 meals. I asked for all the fixings and was presented with a giant bowl with EVERYTHING in it. It was all very good. The salmon was fresh and delicious, and everything that was supposed to be crispy was crispy, everything that was supposed to be spicy, was spicy. I ordered mine with brown rice, and it was great. 

We'll definitely be back soon, and I'll order the regular size next time.

Also, there's parking out front on Birchmount, but you have to approach it from the north. Otherwise, you're doing a giant circle around the block to get there. As far as I can tell, there's no other parking options."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the rapper Action Bronson's show called F Thats delicious and he introduced me to Poke as a hawaiian classic like 3 seasons ago. Looked like a watermelon salad and I was dying to try it.

Well 2 years later and its my first go; and damn! Im in love. On a hot summer day this was so refreshing. Even tho it was cold - i ordered the Mauna Loa Bowl which has lots of spicy content (spicy salmon, spicy seaweed salad, spicy cucumbers and jalapeno) and i asked them to top it off with the spicy aioli. Goodness! How could something so spicy somehow manage to still feel cool going down to my belly. Salmon was jelly soft and tender. The edamami and cucumbers would give it the crisp so that your bites are even. Even the brown rice had a great taste to it. I added some Togarashi to add some more flavour.

All the ingredients we crispy and fresh and the place was clean. Seems like it will be busy. For $12 for the regular, I am completely full but also feel like I made the right decision health wise. 

Overall fulfilling in taste, portion and a semi-clear conscience, asked them to go heavy on the spicy aioli (dont poke me to death for it)."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out Poke Guys for a while but never had to the opportunity to head downtown specifically for it. Well good news they now have a location in Markham. 

It's only at its soft opening phase at the moment, but I'm excited that now there is a grab and go poke joint up here in Markham.

There is a good variety of options to choose from and if your just as indecisive as I am, they have signature bowls that will help fix that indecision in your mind. It's also helpful to ask for the employee recommendations, they can talk you through everything if your newbie to Poke Bowls.

Case in point, a welcoming addition to Markham and I highly recommend checking them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I find the bowls at Poke Guys are just mediocre. The ingredients tasted very bland. I had the Cali bowl and I didn't like how chunky the salmon pieces were. The salmon was marinated with too much sauce to a point that become too overwhelmed. For the price they are charging, they don't serve premium type of crab meat, they used the cheap ones which is pretty disappointing. It's not too bad but still I won't go back"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back here!!! I had a craving for poke bowls so I decided to come here since it had relatively good reviews and was close to me. 

Decor: 3.5/5 very average and not too bad. I liked the big menus and the window lighting made the place super bright. There were only a few tables and some window seats. Very typical fast food joint set up. 

Food: 4.5/5 reeeeaaally loved my bowl. I got the one with crab meat salad in it (too lazy to look up the name lol) and I you could customize the sauce and the toppings. There was a nice selection of toppings and sauces and the lady suggested I try the spicy mayo sauce since I didn't know what to pick. It was great!! The sashimi was good and seemed fresh too. The reason why I docked 0.5 points was because the avocado wasn't diced or fully sliced into pieces. The avocado was sliced but it wasn't all the way, so it seemed like they just put half an avocado in there. You pretty much had to slice it up yourself. In addition, i felt like some of the fish chunks could be smaller. I had a piece of tuna that was so big! 

Service: 5/5 they were super friendly and nice!! Always willing to answer any questions you have :)

Can't wait to try the other signature bowls!"}
{"text":"Ordered a signature bowl. I was given very little quantity and not that good in terms of taste. Definitely not worth the wait, I suggest going else where for lunch."}
{"text":"Finally I no longer have to go all the way downtown for poke guys. Yes there are other Poke places in Markham (komeya Cafe which is closer to me actually.) But Poke Guys was my first actual experience with Poke so I'm loyal Lol. I obviously had to try the Markham location since it conveniently located near my work. 

The location is kinda awkward considering it is not part of the Cineplex building but I think once the area is fully developed it will be a lot better. Parking right now is kinda iffy, you can either park near the carousel or parallel park in the limited spacing near on birchmount. What I did was park at the movie theatre and walk over. It's fine right now in the summer but I can't imagine doing it for the winter. 

This location is about the same size and layout as the downtown location. It was brighter though which is a lot nicer. 

The staff here were really friendly and nice. The guy helping us was very patient and answered all our questions and even made some suggestions. 

The food was just as great as the downtown location but my friend who got the white rice didn't like it as much. I got the brown rice and enjoyed it. So maybe it was the rice choice? 

Would I come back? YES. Would I come back in the winter? Not sure. I'm lazy."}
{"text":"Not bad for a new restaurant.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it had a line. Line went quickly though so I cant complaine. It's a very \"fast food\" type of setting. Which I guess is good since it is a rather tiny place. Very tight inside. You get your poke bowls like you would when you order at subway. 

They need to have some kinks ironed out to be a bit more efficient. The people working there seem to be getting the hang of things but still needs polishing because most of them didnt know exactly what to do when explaining. Also, they forgot our sauces. We had to ask for it. 

Overall, the food is decent. Expensive but decent. Wish they had highchairs for our baby to sit on though. 

TO MOTHERS - this place isnt baby friendly in a sense that there is no high chairs for your baby, no space for a stroller and no changing table in toilet just incase you eat here and you need to change your child. Just FYI. but of course not all restaurants have those features. 

I would come back and possibly try somthing else. But not for another few months till they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Finally a poke place in Markham. Build your own bowl is a bit pricey as each topping is extra. I wish i can switch protein for the signature bowl. Nice options for the base - salad, rice and brown rice. The shoyu protein seems a bit too salty. Overall, great food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"The people of the 'burbs looked up and shouted, \"We want poke!\" and Poke Guys whispered, \"Ok\". Finally bringing the popular Hawaiian rice bowls uptown, I can definitely see this little shop becoming quite popular. Who doesn't love a healthy alternative? And with all the ingredients, you've practically got a rainbow in a bowl (a rainbowl lol) which is Instagram material 101. 

With an impressive spread of fresh ingredients, you're welcomed to create your own or let them arrange one of their signatures for you. The most popular is the Cali Bowl, probably because it contains all of your favourite ingredients like avocado and crab meat AND it has both kinds of fish (salmon & tuna). Others like the Angry Shrimp and Wasabi Octopus are equally enticing, and the Vegetarian is a wonderful green option. 

On my first visit to this location, I ordered a regular Vegetarian Bowl ($11.25) + Crab Meat Slaw ($1.25) + Masago ($0.85) + green onion & ponzu sauce. So correct me if I'm wrong, but with tax, I'm still not sure how my bill came out to over $16. That is really expensive for a regular. And the additional masago came in the tiniest teaspoon amount. I would suggest you skip the additional toppings altogether and just stick with what they've got on the menu. 

Overall, the food itself is pretty good. Can't go wrong with what is essentially a deconstructed sushi roll. Ingredients are fresh and the variety is impressive. I can see myself coming back here quite frequently despite knowing that this is essentially overpriced fast food. But damn, what good fast food it is. 

Before I end this, I'm just going to nag a bit. Come on, Poke Guys, you're fitting perfectly into the sustainability health trend that's sweeping the nation. You are using SO MUCH PLASTIC. Bring in some cardboard bowls or have real bowls for the dine-in customers, or something. Do I need to send you guys a picture of that turtle getting stuck in a plastic bag?

{"text":"I'm SORRY I DIDN'T LOVE IT!
AH, I was always complaining of not having a decent poke place nearby in Markham, and so when I saw that Poke Guys was opening, I was just dying to try it.  But based solely on the food, I can only give it 3 stars :(

(Food:)
I got the PG's BOWL; which was chock-ful of ingredients including: White rice, salmon in classic shoyu, masago, edamame, kimchi, corn, B&W sesame seeds.  The salmon was delicious and fresh (props to that), and the server allowed me to try any of their sauces to see which was best to put on.  I went with the ME SO SESAME, which, I have to admit, was phenomenal.  But yet, with all these compliments, I didn't feel like the dish worked well together.  The white rice was kinda dry and chewy (like there wasn't enough water when cooking it), and it's weird for me to have kimchi on poke.  That spicy flavor really doesn't go well with all the other ingredients.  The corn was a nice touch (especially since I also thought it didn't go very well initially, but I was wrong.)  I definitely feel like it wasn't one of the best poke bowls, based solely on the rice and the mixture of ingredients.

(Price:)
PG's BOWL:  $12.50 

(Service:)
You guys were so nice at POKE GUYS, which is why I feel so bad about giving not the best review.  They're also doing a promotion where I can get 10% off the next time I go, so maybe based on that, I might try this place again.

(Overall:)
I guess I could build my own bowl, but I am a little disappointed in the classics.  Tsuki Izakaya or Komeya Café both do a better one; sorry!  And can we please work towards plastic-free cutlery and dishware.  You guys will waste so much plastic per bowl :("}
{"text":"I'm not sure if you call it Japanese or not. The food is pretty good. It's different in a way. The price is on the high side. I paid $20 for large bowl with a drink. Limited space to seat in. Would I rather have real sushi instead? Your choice."}
{"text":"Really flavorful and tasty lots of topping options and you can create your own poke bowl which is a bonus will definitely come again."}
{"text":"So happy that there's a poke place in Markham now! The sashimi is pretty fresh and there's a good array of toppings. The only thing that was slightly disappointing is that the preset bowls already have the sauce mixed in, and if you were to customize your own bowl, it would be over $20 for the same amount of toppings as the preset bowls which was only $13.

Flavour was good, service was fast. I'll probably come back again to try something else. They're also generous with their portions."}
{"text":"Loved that Markham has gotten Poke Bowls, great location they have seating here. I found the quality and quantity they give you to be superb 

Just quick warning though, Mauna Loa Bowl is very spicy  so only order it if you can take the heat. 

My favourite is the Cali Bowl, with seaweed salad added in."}
{"text":"got the volcano poke bowl (3.5/5 stars for taste ) 
it is spicy has salmon zucchini beans chilli lettuce and more yummy toppings 
salmon and rice ratio is not the best because there is too much salmon in the bowl however it is better than too much rice 
it has big portions which is great 
the flavours of the bowl were very spicy and had good taste 
the restaurant has many options and you can build your own poke bowl 
service is good and efficient as you go down a line of ingredients and add them to your bowl along the way"}
{"text":"I've tried their downtown location and I'm so glad they finally opened one in Markham! What's better than to eat a healthy bowl of poke? Ingredients were fresh! I'm always weary of eating raw food when it's summer, but their food was stored well and the place is very clean! Friendly people working there too. Just have to be a bit patient with lines as they just opened... but overall highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Finally Poke in markham, great portion for the price. Wonderful service, will come back whenever I go to Cineplex"}
{"text":"Poke Guys really outdid themselves with their new Markham location! The service and food quality did not fall short of my expectations and they really made good use of the space in their store. 

Like their OG downtown location, there is a selection of 7 signature bowls to choose from that have all the proteins, toppings, and sauces preset or you can build your own and be as elaborate as you want with your customization. I opted for the custom bowl with a base of brown rice, tofu for protein, edamame, corn, seaweed salad and avo. I love the fact that they have so many vegan friendly toppings to customize with- it's like I hit the jackpot when I find a restaurant that gives me options! I absolutely LOVE the spicy seaweed salad. It's actually the only place I've ever had it! It's a nice change from the regular seaweed salad and is such a pretty red color. They also did a really nice job with their sauce (2 vegan options!). The classic shoyu adds just the right amount of flavor, and the fried tofu cubes soak up all the goodness. If they offered a spicy vegan sauce, I think I might cry from happiness (Poke Guys, do it up!). 

I also want to give them a shout out for not skimping on portions and always packing their bowls sky high. The regular bowl might look mini... but dang does it fit a lot of food. I almost always have to finish my regular bowl over two meals, or if I'm REALLY hungry, I'll eat it in one sitting and be soo stuffed afterwards. 

In terms of atmosphere, it definitely has a more new-age, modern vibe than their downtown location. The menu is displayed on LEDs rather than written on chalkboard, and their seating is more sleek and modern. They definitely upgraded and made the space very bright, clean, and hip. 

Without a doubt, Poke Guys is a great addition to the Markham food scene, and definitely a go-to place for me to grab a quick, healthy, and freaking delicious meal. A solid recommendation from me!

PS: With their grand opening this week, lines have been out the door! They've been selling out of poke by the end of the night, so make sure you go a little early these couple of days in case they run out!"}
{"text":"The second location for Poke Guys has opened in Downtown Markham. I had never tried Poke Guys before going to this newest location. It's a small restaurant with seating for about 18 people. It is located in the mixed residential plaza just north of the Pride of Canada carousel, on the south side. Limited street parking is available, or you can also park in the small lot next to the carousel, or in the underground parking lot for that condo/plaza.

There are several signature poke bowls such as the spicy Mauna Loa or the Cali bowl (with shoyu marinated salmon and tuna, avocado, surimi crab salad, and salad greens; $11.25 regular or $14.75 for large). One can also choose to build your own bowl ($10.25 for a regular sized bowl or $13.75 for large). I'm not sure how many toppings that comes with but you can choose from tuna, salmon, octopus, tofu, or shrimp (octopus or shrimp for an additional $1). 

You can add certain toppings free of charge, such as ginger, radish, fried onion, diced onions, green onions, jalapeños, and sesame seeds. You can also choose from about 7 different sauces. Most of the additional toppings (such as corn, edamame, pineapple chunks, and spicy cucumber) are $0.85 each. Premium toppings like crab meat slaw, avocado, kimchi, and spicy seaweed salad are $1.25.

I like that you can choose between white or brown rice, or if carb conscious, have salad greens. I also like that they don't automatically give you a plastic cover for your poke bowl if you're eating in, which in a small way helps to reduce waste. 

During the soft opening they only accept cash. Thankfully there is a TD bank in the same plaza and a Royal Bank nearby. I am happy to see a poke place open in my neighbourhood and can see myself coming here for a healthier alternative to some of the nearby fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
I went on soft opening.  Friendly, clean, and staff knows their menu!

Food
=====
Ordered the signature.  Ingredients tasted fresh, seasoning was good, overall I really liked it!

Perfect summery dish, light, refreshing but still very filling and satisfying.

Would I come back?
===============
Yes!  As long as the budget permits :).  It's a little on the pricy side but I guess that can't be helped :/."}
{"text":"Finally poke in Markham!! These guys are my fave for poke as they have fresh and good variety of ingredients and are one of the few that marinate their fish!"}
{"text":"Congratulations at Poke Guys on successfuly opening in the heart of Downtown Markham. So happy to have you guys nearby. Now I don't have to travel that far for your delicious poke bowls  I already tried Poke Guys and had the opportunity to try them two more times at two Yelp Elite events.

On grand opening day in Markham, it took me two visits to finally get my BOGO poke bowls. I thought I would be ok arriving at 1135 am, beating the crowd and running towards the store because how slow can making a poke bowl be? But no, I was wrong. There was a huge line with lots of students waiting. Normally, I don't despair when I see a huge line as long as it was moving but alas it wasn't moving much or moving at the speed of a snail.  Staff was not at full capacity as the lunch crowd started to arrive. I see a worker arriving to the store at 1140am. I had to make a decision: Keep waiting and try my luck or leave.  While I was pondering whether to leave the line or not, I saw a group of Aviva employees behind me leave and more people leaving afterwards. After waiting close to 30 mins and seeing how many people were still in front, I gave up and left. It would have probably taken close to an hour and I only had 45 mins for lunch. Disappointed, my colleague made me a tuna sandwich for lunch.


Take 2: I made another visit after work and got there at 437. I was near the door and close to the counter to order by 5 pm. The Staff size definitely increased, which lead to shortrr wait time. It was still slow might you but moving at a better pace than at lunch.   

What are Poke bowls you ask? It's a Hawaiian dish that includes sashimi, rice, veggies, and many more.  I opted for their two signature LARGE poke bowls and it was so well worth it.

Cali Bowl which consists of white rice, salmon & tuna classic shoyu, crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, fried onions, nori, B&W sesame seeds.
.
A Hui Hou Bowl that I opted for brown rice, honey ginger salmon, crab meat slaw, edamame, seaweed salad, masago, fried onions, B&W sesame seeds. .
.
Go with their Classic Signature Poke Bowl(s) or build your own poke bowl. All this and your choice of garnishes and sauce. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the A Hui Hou Signature Bowl more and am so glad to have ordered it as opposed to just getting two Cali Poke Bowls. The A Hui Hou Signature had more flavour and was tastier imho.

Portions size were very generous. They filled the bowl with lots of ingredients and the two bowls in the bag were heavy.

Workers were very helpful in helping me select the garnishes and the sauces. They were mostly nice and friendly.  There are about five four person tables and a couple of tall seats table by the window. Poke guys can be found nearby the carousel.  There are limited parking by the carrousel / terre Rouge parking lot. Don't part in the Remington customer service parkjng spots or u may be in for a surprise.

I can't to go back to try the other poke bowls, one bowl at a time"}
{"text":"First time eater of Poke Guys and I must say the A Hui Hou Bowl definitely hit a spot. I have seen numerous videos on YouTube and I decided to try it out. I can't reiterate as much that I truly enjoyed my meal and will definitely try out the entire menu. I highly recommend this location, the staff is superb!"}
{"text":"Ordered Cali and octopus bowls, I don't know why people like to eat this. Two bowls taste the same, no difference. The octopus is really hard to chew, it took me 5 minutes to chew only 1 piece. My temples are going to explode. Salmon is just OK. Rice is too hard and raw.
I will not go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good, although it falls slightly short of the Downtown location. Establishment is small, with little seating area. Service is super quick and friendly though!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and order the large Cali bowl with toppings of edamame, spicy cucumber salad, seaweed salad. All this costed me $20.11 with each topping costing $0.85 each.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Be aware that each toppings cost $0.85 while more premium toppings cost $1.25 each.

Nowhere does it say in the store on signature Bowl menu that toppings cost extra. Only on the build your bowl menu is  where it clearly states that toppings cost more.

They need to be more clear on this. Especially when signature bowls already cost so much money. Think about when you actually have to build your own bowl. It would cost an arm and a leg.

It's kind of pricey to pay for fish, rice, toppings for $20 lunch. Flavours were ok. Nothing really stood out. Kind of too vinegary to my liking. 

Parking is hard to access the store. No u- turns allowed to get to the store front."}
{"text":"Great addition to the new upcoming downtown Markham. Finally a poke store uptown that helps satisfy my craving. Many options from signature bowls to create your own! My favourite is the Cali bowl with greens! Healthy and light option, especially for the Summer!"}
{"text":"This is the same Poke Guys from downtown. I was excited to hear they were opening a Markham location so came to check it out. I was a bit worried about the parking in that area but found street parking pretty easily and saw that there was a small parking lot right in front next to the Carousel.
I ordered the Build Your Own Bowl which I usually got downtown and it was just as I expected. Lots of different flavors and textures from all the garnishes. Salmon was fresh and seasoning balanced well with the brown rice I chose.
The line was a bit long but was expected with the grand opening.
Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I finally heard there was going to be a poke place uptown!! I came here during their grand opening when they had their bogo buy 1 get 1 free promo. I was there at around 5:50pm and waited 1.5 hrs. 

I debated between their Cali bowl, spicy volcano, and angry shrimp but since I wanted to try something new I opted for the spicy volcano and angry shrimp.

I got both bowls in large ($15.25) and I was amazed by the amount of toppings they had! They really didn't skimp out on any of the toppings.  The portion was very generous and if you're a light eater you can definite share. The protein was also marinated unlike other places and they were cut big too. Spicy volcano was made with spicy salmon and the other was spicy shrimp. Both were crazy spicy for me. I definite couldn't handle the heat lol.

The one thing I didn't like about their build your own bowl is that extra $0.85 on regular toppings and $1.25 for premium toppings because other place would have the toppings included in their price. Side note, their spicy seaweed salad is yummy! And they don't have this elsewhere. 

Besides this, I would have back in the future for their Cali bowl!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Cali bowl . Food was very delicious. Yet not kids friendly, not enough space to fit stollers, seats are limited . Also food and drink were pricey . It is a good restaurant worth to try one time as food and drink are too pricey"}
{"text":"This is one of the few poke restaurants in Markham. It's close in Downtown Markham, and you can park near the merry go round. The food menu was very easy to follow. I chose the Cali. Service was great - because you can really customize it to what you want. You chose a base (salad, brown rice, white rice), followed my toppings, seasoning and then sauce. Avacodos and Salmon was fresh and yummy. 

Tip: you can also go 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad 

There's a few tables to sit on in the store, but overall it feels more like a to-go type of place"}
{"text":"So happy there's a new poke spot uptown in Markham - definitely the only one so far that specializes in only poke! I've always wanted to try the downtown location but it was always too far away.

Located across from Terre Rouge/the carousel just north of Enterprise, parking is tricky. There is some street and underground parking but you basically have to go around in a big circle to park anywhere. If you look it up in Google maps you'll understand what I mean. It might take the same amount of time to park at Kiu/Cineplex and just walk over. 

Space is small inside - enough space for about 20 people since by necessity a lot of it is taken by the actual food. All poke ingredients are out there for you to see and they have a lot of them! 

There are bowls with preset ingredients or you can build your own. I love building my own stuff but it's definitely a lot pricier. When (not if) I go again I'll get the Cali bowl which has all the good stuff - tuna, salmon, avocado... preset bowls are cheaper. Even though it's pricey in general the portions are good and ingredients are super fresh - my dad commented on the nice spring and fattiness of the salmon and he loves his fish. Avocado is precut and wrapped up in saran wrap for picture perfect avocado slices.

The fish here is marinated unlike the handful of places up here that do serve poke and it makes a big difference. They have a variety of marinated proteins - including tofu, spicy salmon/tuna and wasabi octopus as well as the regular shoyu. There are lots of sauces to choose from and garnishes.

While not an everyday thing because of the price, I will definitely be back for my poke fix."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this place, I wanted to try this place myself ! I came here for on a Saturday lunch and this place was pretty packed. The place was quite small ( only had few tables ). Ideally, this place was meant for takeout. 

I ordered the Large Mauna Loa Bowl ($15.25)- spicy shoyu salmon, spicy seaweed salad, spicy cucumber , edamame, masago , fried onions with additional avocado ($1.25). There was an option for brown or white rice. I went for brown! This bowl was massive ! Instant regret ordering large... I think regular was more than enough for me. They gave plenty of spicy salmon and all the other goodies ! If you like spicy , this one had a perfect kick to it ! LOVE it ! 

This food was pretty darn good but the only thing I wasn't too happy was the space for this place. It was difficult to find a spot and enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Fact: Soft Open for the next two weeks
Fact: Currently cash only - as the machine is currently still in transit.
Fact: This place is busy. 

I am excited that a poke place has finally opened up in Markham - giving me a option to get my poke fix outside of the local supermarket. 

Right now this place is taking cash only, so that is something to keep in mind. 

The Poke Guys set bowls are probably the better value here - since the build your own does add up - as they charge by topping. 

I do like the different types of marinated sashimi they offer 9 varieties from spicy to classic soy. 

Pricing is in line with what I expect for a poke place. 

Service is friendly and they are extremely patient with you, while you try to decide what kind of toppings you want if you want a make your own bowl. 

Phone orders - they are willing to do it - but they do forewarn you that people coming in physically do bump you so that there is a bit of a wait. 

Overall - so glad good quality poke has arrived in Markham."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. Great staff; they acknowledged their customers; they were attentive, polite, and helpful. 
I ordered the mauna loa bowl. It was spicy and filling. The bowl is a tad salty or maybe I just have sensitive taste buds. Either way, it still tasted good and I would come back again and try other bowls."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great quantity!

However, extremely overpriced. I paid almost $15 for a regular build your own bowl with 3 toppings [$0.85 cents each - excluding spicy seaweed salad, crab salad and avocado]. What really got me was the CANNED pineapple. It does provide a sweet taste to the bowl but I can buy canned pineapple anywhere for a cheaper price. 

I got the honey ginger salmon and it was very flavourful and marinated well. It was also a plus because it was very fresh and sweet - a good addition to a sweet et savoury bowl. It is pretty trippy though because the proteins are mixed with cucumbers and sometimes you may not get as much protein as you paid for. As well, a seaweed salad topping is a must! It adds to the dish and gives you a very traditional feel. Personally, I asked for the sauce on the side because sometimes it can overpower the dish so that you only taste the mayo or whatever the case may be. 

The overall quantity was very filling and I'd suggest sharing a large with someone to save money. As well, I was greeted with friendly staff when I entered and exited the restaurant so A+ in terms of service. But beware! Parking is VERY DIFFICULT to find because it is right beside a bus only street so pay special caution to this!!"}
{"text":"Parking: There was a small parking lot just across from this venue which is free.

Washrooms: This place just opened up a few weeks ago, so it's new and clean.

Experience/Venue: Small establishment, there's a window counter you can sit to eat your meals, and 3 small tables. The experience is like a typical walk-in and customize your meal.

Food: I rarely eat poke, but this was pretty good for a \"fast food\" type. And it's really healthy."}
{"text":"Poke guys opened a location in markham!!!

So I've never eaten poke before until now, but a lot of people have been recommending me to try. So I went with my special friend to check it out. Took like 10 minutes to get there, parking was kinda awkward though. We had to park at the carousel next door. We got there and it was PACKED. There was no sitting space for us, because of the size of the place.

On to the food! I got a small California bowl and my friend got a large. It comes with white rice, salmon & tuna classic shoyu, crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, fried onions, nori, B&W sesame seeds. The salmon was fresh and fatty (good healthy kind) and the tuna was marinated to perfection. The crab meat Cole slaw was absolutely to die for, I got an extra helping of it. The rest were all very fresh and tasty, but nothing special. We got coconut water with it. The price was reasonable and we are definitely going back. 

There were other meat options and vegetation. Wasabi octopus and spicy shrimp were both pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The spicy version of the salmon and tuna both are like 4/10 on the Asian level of spiciness (not the pathetic Tabasco sauce level)

If you decide to come I definitely would recommend starting with a Cali bowl and then building your own the next time!


P.s. no idea if they have wifi (pokemon life with the poke for a poke date would've been nice)

The owner is pretty cool too I guess, service was very friendly, but the person who took my order gave me the wrong size after messing up my friend's order, but that's okay, new people and all that. They have been opened in this location for roughly a week.

Fresh fish, nice toppings, friendly staff, what more could I ask for? (Wifi cough cough)"}
{"text":"Poke Guys opened their second location and its a great spot, close to residential area, businesses, Markham VIP, the gym, etc. Store is north of the carousel parking lot. Soft opening is today, grand opening is May 23. Format and menu are the same as their downtown location. Space is clean and bright. There is approximately 20 seats available as this store is more a grab and go. Staff are very friendly and helpful. 

Ingredients are fresh and there are a variety of toppings, garnishes and sauces to choose from. Aside from the usual salmon and tuna, they also offer octopus and shrimp (at additional charge). Gluten free and vegan portions are available upon request! Bowls are available in two sizes and portions are generous. They are currently waiting for the scoops to arrive so portions may change down the road. 

Definitely come try the poke bowls here!"}
{"text":"Poke has been a new trend in the GTA around the past 2 years, majority of poke places are opened in downtown so it's always exciting to see poke joints opened up closer to me. They have a ton of variety. You can either build your own bowl or get one on their fixed menu. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of food they serve. Perhaps the protein they use isn't fresh? It's already premixed with zucchini and scallions and drenched in soy sauce. The quantity of food is fair and it does fill me up, but is it good? Or will I ever go again? Probably not. There's also a line up which I don't understand since it's not even good and I'm practically surprised by how high this place is rated."}
{"text":"Today was poke guys grand opening, so all the signature bowls were BOGO free! Amazinggggg! 
The wait was about 45 minutes, it was a nice day so I didn't mind :) 

It was my first time trying poke and I thought it was great! 
I highly highly recommend the volcano bowl. If you like spice, this is the bowl for you. 
All the signature bowls in a large are $15.25 plus tax. 
The portions are huge! I would probably just get a regular next time, but I just had to take advantage of the BOGO deal. 
The salmon was very fresh and the ingredients went really well together. 

This place is off to a great start! Cant wait to go back and get it again :)"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Enterprise Blvd. and Birchmount Rd. There were no parking spots in the direct vicinity, but we parked on the side of a side-street and walked to the entrance. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The staff were friendly and courteous. They also had a good eye to make the bowls look good because every poke bowl was so aesthetically appealing. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Simple, clean, and there were a couple seats if you want to dine-in. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
The sashimi was fresh and other toppings were fresh, but the avocado was not ripe and the rice was kind of stale. 

[ORDER] - 3/5
- Cali Bowl (Regular) - $12.50: includes classic shoyu salmon & tuna, but felt like there weren't that many pieces of sashimi because each piece was cut slightly too large. I think the biggest setbacks were the unripe avocado and stale rice! At least the sesame miso dressing was nutty and you can't really go wrong with it. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
Overall, Poke Guys is a good place for poke bowls in the area, but I think there are better spots in Markham. Definitely worth a try, but not my favourite because of the minor setbacks in the ingredients."}
{"text":"Poke Guys use to be a challenge to get to since they were Downtown...not anymore! This location is in the heart of a new development in Markham; a seafood boil restaurant, Goodlife, VIP Cineplex, TD, RBC, the list goes on and on.

Food was fresh as is with the Toronto location & service was fast and friendly. They haven't had their Grand Opening yet so it's \"Cash Only\", but with the multiple banks within walking distance an ATM is not a problem.

I ordered the Cali Bowl which had a mixture of Salmon & Tuna (best value in my opinion). Will try the octopus next time, but probably will always be going back to my Cali Bowl!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cali bowl. The fish is super fresh, and works well with all the other topping. I feel like the rice could use a bit more vinegar though..."}
{"text":"Finally, there's a poke place in Markham! Its currently in its soft opening and its cash only for the time being. Luckily there was a TD around the corner! 

My friends and I got the Cali and Mauna Loa signature poke bowl; both were fairly priced at $11.25 for a regular size. I definitely recommend getting a signature bowl as opposed to building your own because it can add up... the base (rice and protein) starts at $10.25 and each topping is $0.85-$1.25. 

The fish was super fresh but the cali bowl itself was too salty for my liking. I feel like they need some sort of sweetness or tang to balance it out. The creamy avocado helped but I was still super parched for water. I'm not sure if it was the sauce I got (creamy togarashi and me so sesame) or the marinade of the fish. 

The Mauna Loa was spicy, but a good kind of spicy. The spicy seaweed was an interesting addition, giving the bowl a nice bite. Overall, no complaints with this one!

The workers here were really helpful and knowledgeable on all of the different selections they offered! Great service!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star with room for improvement

Welcome Poke Guys to Markham! The first poke bowl location in the hood! I am excited! No more just drooling over poke bowl food photos and going all the way to Toronto to have one of this treat!

Located in Downtown Markham, underneath a Condo development. Parking might be a little challenge but there are some street parking or you can utilize the Condo's business parking underground.

Menu is the same as downtown. For my first visit, I tried the Cali Bowl ($11.25). I love how fresh the toppings! Especially my avocado was freshly cut when ordered, no brownish and bruised sad looking avocado. The only flaw maybe the white rice which was dry and hard and lack seasoning.

Being the only game in the hood, I will be back to try other Signature bowls or even build my own. Hopefully by then Poke Guys will be Best Bowl in town!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday 530pm. No lineup. I stood in front of the cash counter for like 3+ mins without anyone acknowledged me, although there were around 4-5 guys working in front of me. I left cause I parked after the parking sign.  Found a proper parking spot so I went back in again.  Stood for another minute+. Finally the owner? next to the cashier asked if I was waiting for my order???? 

Ordered the regular Cali bowl (deconstructed california roll).  Garnished with crispy fried onion n yummy seaweed.  (I had to ask the gentleman 3 times to give me more seaweed.  Wanted it to look nice in the pic.)  Taste good. Nice fresh shoyu salmon n tuna.   Was going to give a 3 stars but +1 star because the owner? offer me 10% discount for the wait."}
{"text":"Poke guys is a chain from downtown that is very popular. I occasionally go there for lunch as it is fairly far from my work, but having a store in Markham makes it all the more accessible now. 

Firstly, the food is delicious! It's true that the poke is mixed with cucumbers and marinated in soy sauce, but if you are an avid sashimi fan you can practically tell how fresh the fish is through the seasoning. It's definitely good quality fish and the portions are fairly large. Not to mention the price - most places charge you an arm and leg for the portion you get from this place!

Now if we're talking about authentic poke, this may not be your first stop. I've had authentic poke outside of Canada and it's a different beast. However, Poke guys truly excels at its countless options for customization and sublime service and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fix. 

I see some bad reviews and I can see where some people are coming from (long line, fish marinated in soy, etc), but this is undoubtedly best poke you are going to get in Markham. Hands down."}
{"text":"Having been to their OG Downtown location on Elizabeth, we decided to check out their second new location here in DT Markham. Great addition to the area however, not as great compared to the one DT.

We got The PG, Cali and Mauna Loa Bowls and they were pretty good. The ingredients were all fresh and flavourful however, what fell short was the rice (something you wouldn't expect to go wrong).

The white rice was hard and stale and it was as though the rice had been dried up in the pot for days. Pretty unusual since rice is pretty easy to make. We told the staff and they did compensate by giving us free topping coupons, which we thought was nice. The staff were also really understanding and friendly.

Portions were huge and decently priced (ranged from $11-$20).

We'll probably be back to this location once everything has settled, but for now, the rice was a downfall.

{"text":"I was excited to see a poke place open up in the 905 area and away from the downtown core. Having tried Poke Guys downtown and not enjoying it, I was holding my breath for the Markham location. Located in \"downtown\" Markham, the restaurant was tiny with only about 4 tables and some counter space. I went during the first week of opening and there was a long lineup spilling out the door. The line moved relatively fast. I ordered a large Cali bowl for myself. Big chunks of marinaded raw salmon and tuna over a bed rice (brown or white), crab meat slaw, avocado, masago, nori topped with dressing of your choice. Portion are larger than most other places. It was delicious!! My second visit a week later was equally good. TIP: if the server is scooping poke from the top of the container, you're good. If it's the bottom of the container, it's sitting in a lot of marinade so make sure she drains it well before putting it over rice. Otherwise your rice will get soaked with shoyu and will be too salty."}
{"text":"Tried the Cali Bowl & Wasabi octopus bowl, around $12 each. I got the regular size but it's still fulfilling. Hmm honestly I don't think it is that good, but I keep wanting to eat. Oh would recommend trying the brown rice, I think it tastes better than the regular rice. prob will come back again to try the A Hui Hou bowl."}
{"text":"Umm I'm not sure how I feel about this place. The restaurant is tiny (I think it can sit like a Max of 12 people) and the line up is out gracious. It took 20 mins for 3 of us to order our lunch. The staff were extremely friendly and they are extremely extremely clean. I think they changed gloves after serving every person. The food is okay. I didn't like their choices of sauces so I went sauce less. For the poke bowl, I would rather in all honesty go across to good catch for lunch. I just find it more flavourful and more comfortable to sit in. The food was fresh so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Summertime brings with it a thirst for lighter cuisine and what can be better than a big bowl of poke? 

I visited during the grand opening of Poke Guy's new Markham location with Buy One Get One Free bowls all day. I arrived mid day and the line was out the door. Luckily the counter is right at the entranceway so the line looked bigger than it actually was (probably about 15-20 people). I waited a little over 30 min to get to the front of the line which was a little surprising since there were about 4-5 people serving behind the counter and really all that needed to be done was scoop from the containers into the bowls.

In terms of space, there are several tables at the side of the restaurant where customers can eat their bowls after purchasing it from the counter. I didn't see many people dining in while I was there and most people seemed to be taking out. However, I can imagine if coming during the lunch/dinner hour, it could get quite busy.

I picked up a large Cali Bowl ($15.25) and and a PG's Bowl ($15.25) and they were both quite filling with a decent amount of topping, but tastewise, they were fairly ordinary. The rice seems to not be quite consistent; with one bowl having wet mushy rice and the other cooked to a much better consistency and also having better seasoning. 

The Cali Bowl seems to be the favourite among customers and is topped with shoyu salmon & tuna, avocado, crab meat slaw, masago, fried onions, nori & B&W sesame seeds. I found that by mixing shoyu with the fish, it results in a more savoury flavour and somehow takes away from the natural fresh taste of the fish. The crab was a little bland and could have done with more seasoning. The rest of the toppings didn't do much to lighten (or add any pop of flavour) to the dish either.

I much preferred the PG's Bowl which seemed much lighter and fresher than the Cali Bowl. The PG's bowl has three scoops (rather than one) of the shoyu salmon and is also topped with edamame, kimchi, corn, fried onion, pickled red ginger and B&W sesame seeds. Although the kimchi was quite mild, it still added a nice tangy and slightly spicy flavour to the bowl. The corn and edamame also helped to add some fresh sweet notes and the pickled ginger really gave the bowl a nice punchy tangy kick.

While Poke Guys might not be my first choice for poke, with the current promotion, it is quite a steal and makes for a decent healthy meal. If dropping by, be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Came by on Tuesday and turned away because closed for a private party. Gave me a card for a free topping and said to come back tomorrow.  Came next day and wouldn't let me in because running out of things... even though there were people in line being served.   Didn't seem too sorry about it even after telling him that it was two days in a row. 
The food might be good, but getting in is hit or miss.  Just saying... you might want to call before making the effort of coming.  I get that it's new, but being turned away twice is not fun."}
{"text":"The Poke Guys near City Hall I've ordered many times before, so with the Markham location opening near my house, I was filled with anticipation!  

And just as I hoped, the service level, food quality and presentation are on par with the Downtown Toronto location.  I ordered the Large size Mauna Loa Bowl with Kimichi added-on.  It is packed with flaours from the spicy seaweed salad, jalapano to spicy salmon.  I would recommend this bowl if you enjoy your poke spicy.   

The PG's bowl is my second recommendation if you want poke that is not spicy and lighter in tastes compared to Mauna Loa.  

Overall, I would say Poke Guys Markham/Downtown provides the best poke bowls in terms of value and food quality consistency.  I'm saying this in comparison to other places I have tried: Poke Box, Lahuna Poke, Su&Bu and Calli Love."}
