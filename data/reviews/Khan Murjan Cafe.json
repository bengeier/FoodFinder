{"text":"We went here as a fairly large group and it was easy to find seating. The restaurant itself is quite nice with seating both inside and outside in the plaza hallway which works out fine.   The food itself can only be described as fabulous! Delicious, authentic Iraqi food that is full of flavor and lots of choices in the buffet. The dolma was the star of the night, it was a perfect blend of flavours you'd normally only find at home. The service is acceptable, with the servers very willing to help and bring whatever you need. Definitely will be coming back here with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service they robe  us and their customers they charge us 14$ for a plate of veggie .comes with 1 small tomato cut in slice, and 1 small cucumber slice to a small pieces an some olives . I'm not sure how that could be 14 $  Will never go back"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy .. The food is good and fresh the salad is not great and the dessert is very average we come back because we like the fish \"Masquf\""}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a place with pide in my neighbourhood, but their manakeesh are even better. Both are freshly made to order and quite delicious. You must go here!"}
{"text":"I came here for their Saturday brunch for 10.99.   They had a good variety of Middle Eastern food such as gyro meat, eggs, falafel, Turkish pizza, other stuff that tasted good (had no idea what it was) and some fresh fruits.    While the food was great, service is almost non existent.  Just tell them you are there for the buffet and seat yourself.  Also, if you need drinks, you have to go up to the cash.  Verdict: come here for great self-serve Middle Eastern buffet."}
{"text":"Perfect fluffy Dow... Can be more creative with Turkish pizzas.  Service is ok when not busy on weekends with buffets..."}
{"text":"Been here several times to have the Turkish Style Pizza (Pideh). I really enjoy the mozzarella one, taste is consistent and the dough is really nice. I've tried the meat one a few times too but i find it to be slightly undercooked.   They have a lot of other great items on the menu including a breakfast buffet on weekends. Service there is very pleasant as it seems like its a family run business but they always make you feel welcome.... Remember to try the mozzarella pideh if you are in the area"}
{"text":"We went there with a group of 9 people for their Saturday famous breakfast buffet. But since it was the day after the holidays and new year, they did not have it !!! In order not to disappoint us, they told us to order anything we want from the menu and they will charge us the same $10.99 price !!!  There was one server lady there and she was running back and forth brining us plate after plate after plate till we were completely full. On top of this they made us hot black tea and a big plate full of fresh fruits ! Absolutely amazing food and service that makes you feel at home. Thank you so much for being in our neighborhood, this is a place that deserves our unfeathered support."}
