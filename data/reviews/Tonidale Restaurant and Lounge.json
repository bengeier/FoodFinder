{"text":"Just went to the bar after fundraiser. Security was at the bar drinking. . But they wouldn't serve my sister. There was an old man next to me drolling Ghost bar! No wonder? Go somewhere else! Dive!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible, took girl friend there and she died that night. Before she died I bought us a double beers. Draft beer of miller light is 4 bucks, are u fucking killing me. Bottles are 3 bucks. How in the fuck is a draft of miller more than a bottle. Don't eat here or drink. Place is always dead. Don't waste your time. I even asked the owner Shawn, why a draft of miller costs 4 bills and he said, \" um not sure, but can I get you a beer\" I laughed at him."}
{"text":"We went to the Tonidale a week ago during a Friday Happy Hour.  I have lived in the west for the last 10 years and this is the 3rd version (during my time out here) that the Tonidale has been renovated change.  I hadn't eaten here in 7-8 years.  IT will probably be another 7-8 years before I eat there again.  The service was good, our waitress was pleasant.  there was a decent draft selection (20 beers on tap, about 5 domestics and then the rest were craft brews).  Food was OK.  Menu was a little of this/little of that.  I had a meatball sandwich that was big but OK.  My wife had tacos which were also OK.       Older crowd as well.  Not a bad experience, but nothing that makes me want to run back!"}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly good dive yinzer bar on your way to or from the Post Gazette Pavillion for a quick bite and some brews.  I was here on Monday on my way to the Police concert with a friend and we stumbled upon this oasis located perfectly next to a days inn (I think).  Their are some regular tables a few pool tables, dart machine, jukebox, plasma and a pretty large bar mostly inhabited by regulars.  They don't have guiness on tap, but do have the draught cans and the service was very friendly and perfectly paced.  As soon as I or my friend sat down a beer the next one was served within seconds.  We ordered a couple of crown shots, that were really cheap and easily a two or three shot pour.  The wings were first rate, huge, juicy and perfectly seasoned.  I ordered the steak sandwich, which was huge piled high with grilled onions and cheese and this nice jalapeno salsa mixture.  I was surprised that it was real shaved sirloin and not steak umms.  The \"taters\" were also a treat.  I guess the best way to describe them is a cross between home cooked chips and hash browns sauteed perfectly and served with onions.  The portions are huge and cheap, the service great, the food above average and the crowds friendly.  I'll be back."}
