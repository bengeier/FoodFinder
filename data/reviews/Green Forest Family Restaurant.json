{"text":"Very good for a family restaurant type diner. They make you feel welcome and you can linger. I am from Chicago and it definitely reminds me of the comfortable family restaurants there."}
{"text":"Place is a classic. Greek family runs it. Food is good and the service is great. Chili os always a favorite."}
{"text":"It's a nice classic style mom and pop diner. Good prices for a home cooked meal. I go there about once a month for a breakfast during the lunch hour. I usually get the southwestern skillet or ham and cheese omelet."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time this past weekend, reminded my wife and me of upstate NY diners.  We ate there around noon, so two of us had lunch, one breakfast.  The waiter was super nice, told us we could order anything on the menu anytime.  The food was excellent, real mom and pop feel.  My wife's burger had a nice sear on it, Swiss and fresh mushrooms.  I had an excellent club sandwich made with hand carved turkey, good fries.  My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes (good parenting in action), and a side of bacon, of course.  Clean plate club for all three of us.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and never an empty coffee cup, the food was delicious and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was looking for early-morning diners that weren't IHOP/Perkins/Denny's, and I found this place tucked away. I came here for an early breakfast. The place was really clean and not packed (though it could be because I came too early), like a Holiday Inn dining room as decorated by a grandma.  I ordered a country-fried steak with scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast, as well as a cup of coffee. I've ordered this meal at several similar diners, and in every respect this establishment does it better. The coffee is stronger and more flavorful, the steak fried better and more meaty-tasting, the scrambled eggs fluffier, the hash browns crispier, the toast more buttery. I would say that the only inconvenience is that it's away in Monona, far away from any center of commerce, which means that one has to go a ways out to take advantage of this place. But if I'm already awake with several hours before I have to start my day, I definitely will be coming here in the future to watch the sun rise over another good, hearty American breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is a classic 70s style diner. If you go in between 8:30 - 11 a.m it is full of retirees. The food is on the heavy side - patty melt on rye, meatloaf, chili, etc. All well prepared, but you could not eat here every day without becoming the size of a barn. I find the family running this place a little on the creepy-side. Friendly, but there mannerisms are just slightly off-center. All of that said, I chow here once a month."}
{"text":"very good mom and pops breakfast .. hit the spot! hash browns were nice crispy and the pancakes are very soft... much better and cheaper than any IHOP Perkins Denny's"}
{"text":"The staff were great and very friendly. Went for breakfast and got a lot of food for a good price. Nice homey atmosphere, and what appeared to be a lot of regulars."}
{"text":"The diner is super cute on the inside! Small, family owned business. I ordered French toast. It was very thick & fluffy like Texas toast! It was decent; I've had better. I got hashbrowns with it and with ketchup, it was my favorite part and probably the best I've had. They weren't at all crispy as I usually like but they were very good!! My dad got a blueberry panini and said he enjoyed it. All of the chairs and plates are super cutely decorated. Flowers all over the diner."}
{"text":"Came for the first time this past weekend. Friendly service, food was very decent and the price was about average for the area. The place is within walking distance of our home and I admire we will be back if for that reason alone. The food took a little longer than I am used to from the Cottage Cafe or Pancake House (both in the general area) and the food quality wasn't much different than what you might expect from a family diner. Unlike the Pancake House , this place does accept credit cards. I'm eager to try lunch here as well. I debated between a 3 and 4 overall, but for what it is (family diner) it does it really well."}
{"text":"We took advantage of a rare visit to the Monona area for lunch on the road. I had the ribeye steak meltdown dressed up with onions, mushrooms and Swiss cheese. Also the best French fries I have ever had. My wife enjoyed the grilled chicken breast also with the fries. Both entrees were delicious. The facility is above clean.  Portions were huge and will be a meal at home tomorrow. They have an extensive menu and the prices are right. Only with they were closer to our home."}
