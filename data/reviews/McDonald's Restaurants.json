{"text":"Like most other McDonald's. It can get very busy on weekends and the standard of the food can suffer because of this (not that the standards are that high)    Breakfasts tend to be greasier than other McDonalds' I have visited.    The drive-thru in eastfield serves better food"}
{"text":"Its a McDonalds, so there are no surprises food wise. About nine months ago, this particular branch underwent a very odd refurbishment which makes it look like nothing else on earth and its very dark inside.    The staff vary in competance from reasonable to atrocious. Some of them find it hard to understand orders which are a little different from anything standard (such as a burger without gherkins) but theres usually someone more senior on hand to sort things out.    The food itself is ok. To be honest, despite the fact that its surely uniform, I've eaten better food in other McDs. Most of the burgers seem to be dry and the breakfasts can be a little on the dubious side sometimes. Like I say, you pretty much know what you'll get in this kind of place, and this is no different. It does get stupidly busy in season and even on a standard non season lunchtime though."}
{"text":"I have been in some poor Mcdonalds but this is the worst. It even beats the hell out of the worst McDonalds Ive ever been in and that is one in St Eriksgatan in Stockholm, yuk! I know its supposed to be cheap but the portion sizes are pathetic, service is even worse, and cleanliness? Horrid. I live in Scarborough but oh for a Burger King or KFC! No wonder they closed down in Bridlington. I wont be back."}
