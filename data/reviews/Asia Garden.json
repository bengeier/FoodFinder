{"text":"My wife and I had given up on Chinese food in our area but this place turned our heads. You have to eat here. it's the best Chinese food, compared to Downtown Cleveland. I haven't had anything this good in years.
Try the General Tao's chicken crispy and so good and spicy. We had a Dragon Roll Sushi it was excellent.
  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"That was good! We had the Beef Green Curry, Kung Pao Tofu and vegetable soup as take out. It only took about 15 minutes and the ingredients were really fresh, the meat tender. The Kung Pao was hot enough, the curry less so. Both were perfectly spiced. It's nice to have a good Asian restaurant so close by in Bennetts Corners.

I wish them all good fortune!"}
{"text":"I would have gone w/ 3.5 stars if Yelp offered 1/2 stars but wanted to give the new business the benefit of the doubt. We ordered General Tso's and Chicken Pad Thai for takeout along w/ spring rolls and soup. The General Tso's was some of the best we've ever had but the Pad Thai was very bland. Hot and Sour and Egg Drop soups were both pretty tasty and the spring rolls were \"fine\"."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around! Ingredients always taste fresh and not overly greasy like other places. Service is impeccable. Sushi taste great too!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to eat here today and enjoyed everything. I had an order of sushi and it was great and very fresh. They have a variety of different Asian dishes; Chinese, Japanese, thai. My main meal was delicious too. Highly recommend supporting this restaurant. And the staff was very sweet; the cooks came out to see how everything was."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh! The place is super clean and the staff is friendly! The menu has a wide variety of items! Haven't had a bad thing from there!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Really good, fresh-tasting Chinese food and excellent sushi!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Our go to for great food from through out Asia.  The currys are delicious!!!  It a nice dinner spot on any night.  Never a wait and the owners are the ones making and serving the food.  They want you to enjoy their restaurant as if you were eating at home."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Took my mother here and it's now her favorite.  She drives 30 minutes from her home just because the food is that good.  It's always fresh and so yummy!"}
{"text":"This place just had a soft opening 2 days ago, grand opening coming soon... That being said IT WAS AMAZING, BY FAR BEST SUSHI IN STRONGSVILLE!!! And trust me, I've tried them all. I am so happy to finally have a place like this close by! We also had the red curry, fried bananas, and spicy crab salad and all was top notch. We are excited to go back and try the rest of the menu! This is some GREAT quality sushi and Asian Food and very reasonably priced. We will be Going here a lot... Sorry Sweet Mango, there is a new top dog in town."}
{"text":"We stopped in kind of late in the evening, it was after 9. The reviews so far have been good, so we gave it a try. I had chicken pad Thai and Rick had Szechuan chicken. Mine was good, although I would ask for it to be a little spicy next time. Rick's was good and he's came pretty spicy unlike some places. So many Asian places open and start off so good and fresh and then end up blah like the rest. I hope Asia Garden stays delicious and we will be back."}
{"text":"Good sushi but they need to pack to go orders better as the toppings are always stuck to the cover. Also the quoted pickup time is never accurate (show up 15 minutes later than they tell you).  I'll be back though since it's the best in the area with many of the specialty rolls being very good."}
{"text":"Good, fast, cheap, and extensive menu. Enjoying the Yaki Udon (chicken) and wasabi shumai tonight."}
{"text":"We struggle in the area to find good Asian food.  In our family we like a mix of Americanized Chinese food, Thai food and sushi.  We had thought we found a good balance here but unfortunately where they excel in quality, they SERIOUSLY lack in customer service and why I will never return here or their sister restaurant, Sakura, in Strongsville.  We found metal shavings in one of our dinners on September 19th when we ordered takeout and I returned the next day with a shaving and my receipt looking for a refund.  The owner was rude and obnoxious, insisting that I was being unreasonable and that he didn't know what happened to his food and that if I had called the previous night, he would have refunded me but since I waited a day, he was completely standoffish. I returned home, got the remains of his food out of my trash and returned it to him and he still insisted that I was trying to swindle him.  He refused to give me my money back and gave me just half of it back, which was infuriating considering that I returned 4 whole meals back to him after dropping nearly $60 on takeout. While there may be a shortage of good Asian style options, there is no shortage of good people making good food who are willing to stand by their product.  This guy, however, is not one of them.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Well i have 2 problems with this restaurant. First, my order wasn't right. I tried to order the house special Chicken Kung Lo-Pao Mein. I guess that isn't really a problem, but the dish is fabulous.

The second problem that i had was smelly fingers. Very smelly fingers. As i was in the waiting area, i scratched my mustache and caught a whiff of my index digit...let me tell you, it wasn't pretty. Something was off. It smelled rancid. Really, it smelled like grimy under-flap. Which is strange, because i don't remember credit-carding any hearty women recently. 

Anyway, i award asia garden 2 stars due to my pointer-fingy smelling so terrible while i was there."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for some chinese food but our usual spot is now closed on Monday's so we decided to go outside our comfort zone and give Asia Garden a try based on other yelper's reviews. We ordered takeout and were mostly pleased with everything we ordered. We started with egg rolls and steamed pork dumplings. I enjoyed the egg rolls but my wife thought they had kind of a horseradish taste which they did. The dumplings were the only letdown of the meal...while the flavor was good they were way too doughy and not enough filler. For our entrees we ordered our standard measuring stick dishes for chinese restaurants which are General Tso's chicken and sweet and sour chicken. We were thoroughly impressed with both. The General Tso's was probably some of the best takeout Tso's I've ever had and the sweet and sour was not just the standard battered chicken chunks that most places do nowadays. It actually had onion, pineapple, and peppers in it like it's supposed to be made. The S&S sauce was also better than most I've tried and not super thick and sticky like everywhere else. We also ordered veggie fried rice and it was extremely fresh. It had the normal mix of veggies but what I really enjoyed was the zucchini in it. So fresh and tasty. To top it all off the food was hot and ready when we went in to pick up 20mins after we ordered. So glad we found Asia Garden and I see more visits in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! The orange chicken and cashew chicken are a couple of our favorite entrees to order. Kind, respectful service...great people. Wish them all the best!"}
{"text":"New restaurant: delicious food, beautiful decor, friendly service. 

This restaurant has an impressive menu that offers Chinese food, sushi, Udon noodles + curries. 

We started our lunch with shumai (steamed shrimp dumplings) They were small but yummy.  We ordered shrimp with broccoli and beef with green curry. Each was served with a small bowl of steamed white rice. Both dishes were delicious. The portion size was perfect. Salad was $1 extra. The salad was great with a tasty sesame dressing. 

The decor is lovely. The booths and tables are made of a nice, solid wood. There is a fish tank near the entrance and artwork on the walls. 

Service: the waitress was friendly. The restaurant was empty when we came so we didn't have to wait long for anything. 

Asia Gardens is a great option for good Asian dining. (We will be back!)"}
{"text":"Delicious hunan beef. Also got some sushi. This place will be here a while with how it tastes."}
{"text":"Good food! They offer Japanese, Chinese, and a few Thai dishes. We opted for Chinese tonight. The Mongolian beef was good, but the Kung Pao shrimp was really delicious! Good flavor and spice! The shrimp were good size and plentiful, with lots of veggies. I had the salad (add on for $1). Good, cold lettuce with the delicious ginger dressing. Very nice lady served us. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I Love wild Fusion.I always order the Shrimp and Broccoli I Love it. I just hope it had deliverely because sometimes , when I get off work I be sooo tired.In the Future they really should get a delivery driver,just to drive around the neighborhood.Need to get with the times"}
{"text":"The menu is very extensive, while not inexpensive. I have had the egg drop soup, green hat sushi and home style tofu (which I ordered medium spicy with crunchy tofu and was served as ordered). So far everything has been very good. The only drawback is that take-out cannot be ordered in pint/quart sizes, only per the menu. The interior is comfortable, but, over-lit in the central, open area - replacing the ceiling spots with drop-down lights would make it more inviting."}
{"text":"O
I have orded Tom Yum soup 4 times and fried rice.First two times great.Soup has gone Down hill last 3 times 1 piece of shrimp no cilantro or lemons grass no taste to broth.Very expensive for what you get.Fried rice bland"}
{"text":"The food and the service is exceptional. I will be a repeat customer when in the area."}
{"text":"Believe what you read. This place is great. Even stepped out with a New York sushi roll which is salmon skin and cream cheese. Ordered it accidentally thinking it had grilled salmon and not just the skin, but was pleasantly surprised. Also had the Tom Yum soup. Great flavor and enough spice to clear up sinus congestion. I saw a negative review saying \"not much food for the price\". This is insane. Both my fiancé and I had left overs that will easily equal another meal. If you're in the area and looking for a Chinese food fix, do yourself and whomever your with a favor and stop here. No need to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Finally!!  A great Asian restaurant in my neck of the woods!! Crab Rangoon  wonton soup egg roll general Taos chicken chicken Lo mein and drum roll please..  BEST PORK FRIED RICE EVER!!  So fresh, so delicious!!  And the wait staff are so nice and prompt. I don't know what's wrong with the people who don't like this place. I'm very hard to impress but I was very impressed with this restaurant. It's in a strip mall but whatever. Lol"}
{"text":"Horrible Cheap Restaurent. Very rude customer service. When we ordered 4 large Items. For side, he is crying to give Hot sauce for each Order.  Food is drenched in Oil. And When I pointed out these issues. The owner rudely and arrogantly asked not to come to Restaurent. I'll never go to this Restaurent and horrible Experience Ordering food Here."}
{"text":"Always fresh food and good service. Hope it stays that way! I always get the wonton soup and egg rolls and the wifey loves the hot and sour soup :)"}
{"text":"Omg YUM!!!

This was our first time here. The restaurant is very clean, ambiance is updated and nice, and the staff was very attentive. 

Ok - we ordered:

Wanton soup - it was ok
Tom Yum soup - it was really good. Spicy
Green salad - Yum! Love the ginger dressing 

Pork fried rice - it was so good!! my husband said it's the best pork fried rice he's ever had. 

Paradise roll - my husband said it was delicious. Full of flavor and fresh tasting 

Shrimp and broccoli - excellent as well

The shrimp here are very big and flavorful

We will definitely be back!! So glad we came here and the reason we picked this place is due to the rating on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"It was ok but nothing special. The lunch portions were mostly white rice and did not have any of the things of similar places(fried rice, soup, eggroll, etc..) so it was a pretty small portion of meat/veggies for the price."}
{"text":"Not too shabby as far as take out Chinese goes. Seems like a bit different then the normal crap you get. Maybe real chicken? Wife liked her egg fu young. Not over fried. Will probably key make it out go to China joint! Just a bit pricey. Fried rice was very small $38 for egg foo young, gen tsos chick and orange chicken. Good stuff though."}
{"text":"Fresh Chinese food made to order. Dined in with family and ordered to go from this restaurant and I'm yet to be disappointed in their offerings. Food is served with care and hot to your table and they will make modifications to suit your taste."}
{"text":"This place is a new must try place in cleveland.  The owner/ hostess is worth the stop, she is perfection in hospitality and helpful attentive service.  We had the hot and sour soup, dragon roll, shrimp red curry and pork chow Leon.  Each was perfection of original receipts and a delight.  We will be back frequently."}
{"text":"I have loved everything we have ever ordered from here.  They deliver, on time, and the food is incredibly fresh."}
{"text":"So far I have been very impressed with Asia gardens. The staff is very friendly and they have made several exceptions for me since I'm a vegetarian. They have made dishes that do not even show on the menu. I highly recommend asking for general tsos tofu and they can make it any spicy level you want it is my favorite dish they have. The menu is large and lots of options for the family."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for this first time and we loved it!! I had the Kung Pao shrimp. It was delicious, with just the right amount of spice and flavor. My son had the Mongolian beef and he raved about it so much I had to try it. It was so good I am going to order it next time."}
{"text":"This is our second time at Asia Garden. I didn't take pictures because we ate all the dishes. The food is outstanding! Imagine,  sushi, sashimi and pad Thai a mile from the house. Oh! I left off curry, which was wonderful."}
{"text":"This was best Chinese food restaurant in the area. Portions were generous and there were large chunks of meat on the dishes. Service quick and I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"My preferred local Chinese take out. They make the best crab rangoon! I'd love if they start doing delivery."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place since I live very close and read some good reviews. The menu is extensive! I have ordered take-out 3 times now and I will not be ordering from here again. All of the dishes I've tried were just OK. Not very flavorful and for the price I will be ordering from somewhere else from now on. Maybe the food is better if you dine in... not sure."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and have been looking for a good Chinese place to get takeout. The food is good. The portions are huge! I especially enjoyed the wasabi dumplings. The only thing missing from the meal were fortune cookies. I really look forward to having those at the end of the meal. Even without the fortune cookies we will be going back here again."}
{"text":"So good and so fresh.  Service is excellent and fast.   The Shumai is amazing!!  I had General Tso's Chicken and my husband had Beef with Broccoli.  Both dishes were fresh and full of flavor.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Just had the worst asian meals of our lives. Giving 1 star because we can't give zero. Got order to go and it was missing the plain rice which we were charged for. Vegetables were almost raw. Chunks of beef were unchewably tough. Too much garlic sauce was on things that shouldn't even have it. Wondering if their using it to hide old meat. Won't be ripped off again."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here. I had the chicken teriyaki and the chicken with mixed vegetables. Both dishes tasted the same which led me to think that the same sauce was used in both. There was a lack of flavor in the food but I will give it 3 stars because the food was ready in a timely manner and the staff was welcoming."}
{"text":"Excellent!! They just opened so we tried a few different things and everything was really fresh and delicious. Its got a great atmosphere with modern decor for a nice casual dinner. Staff and owner were very friendly. They have a large sushi menu and chinese menu, limited thai (i.e. curry and pad thai) The sushi was great! Same with the curry, it a perfect spice and heat. My nephew had the General Tso's chicken and thought it was really good. The table next to us got Udon noodles that looked amazing and must have been good as they were none left. Thinking it will be my goto restaurant for Chinese or Thai but I need to try a few more things on the menu (especially those noodles). The owner said he's been trying to open it for 2 years but was held up by the city. http://asiagardenoh.com/"}
{"text":"The food is over priced and not good enough for the price. I ordered a large wonton and only got 5 wontons and they are really small. I was told there would be  large shrimp, in the shrimp with lobster sauce that I ordered, they are not large at all. The shrimp was most likely frozen bassed on the good awful texture they had. The amount of rice you get on a take out order is really small. This place is not worth the effort of even getting dressed."}
