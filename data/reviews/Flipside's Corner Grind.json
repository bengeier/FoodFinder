{"text":"I decided to try something new and so happy i did. Janie eagerly greetd me and was extremely friendly and  knowledgeable regarding the menu selection. Had the Friday special, Shrimp and Andouille sausage grinder...absolutely amazing!!! Was so good ordered a grinder to-go for dinner. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Cozy place with great flavors and friendly folk.. We were in a hurry so we stopped by expecting a standard fast food joint experience but this place was anything but standard.. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Caesar salad with chicken the other day for lunch and it was totally fantastic definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  Parm grinder is huge.  Tastes incredible and you can tell everything is fresh."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Pineville and are looking for local \" go-to\" restaurants. We went for lunch on MLK Day, and Flipside will be a definite addition to our list. The menu has a nice variety, using high quality ingredients, and the portions were plentiful. I got the ham and brie sandwich, which was huge and yummy! I took half home. The potato salad was a winner as well. My husband got the Monday special of brisket sandwich, and said he will be returning for an encore on Mondays. There was a nice crowd, the restaurant was clean and the service was friendly and quick. The prices are what you would expect to pay for lunch just about anywhere-$8-10. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Having been a huge fan of their sister, Flipside Cafe in Fort Mill, I couldn't wait to give this one a try. It's not a huge place; the decor is cute, and it is clean!!!    I had their Mushroom Soup and shared the Pastrami Reuben with my husband.  My mushroom soup was different from what I'm accustomed to, however, it was very good.  My husband wasn't much of a fan of my soup, but he did enjoy the Reuben. Can't please everyone, right?  I'm anxious to return to try their smoked salmon bagel, other items they offer, AND more of that awesome mushroom soup!!  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food and great service! It is hard to find a great sandwich place around town, but this place is a winner. I ordered the turkey B.L.T. With a side Caesar salad which was delicious. We also ordered the coffee ice cream cookie sandwich with definitely completed the meal:)  The best thing about Flipside's Corner Grind is that I could tell the ingredients were fresh with little to no additives because I did not feel full when I left. Usually if I eat out I feel bloated and gross, after I ate here I felt excited to return again soon!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken salad sandwich and Caesar salad side! This little neighborhood sandwich shop is hidden on the Main Street of Pineville. We had the sandwiches for lunch and the portions are generous on top of the sides. Fairly priced too, around $9 each. The owner is friendly and gives good advice. Parking is across the railroad tracks at a lot.  For the uptown crowd, asking how to find Pineville? Begin by your drive south on Park road until it changes names to Johnston road and then turn right onto 51/Pineville Matthews and drive all the way to Pineville ( if you get to 77 and Carowinds you drove too far!)"}
{"text":"My son had the turkey sandwich, my daughter had the lobster roll and in had the cheesestake and everything was great.  My kids are picky eaters.  Portions are great.  Finally a great sandwich place!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great prices. We come every Thursday night before music bingo across the street. I have had some friends come with us and complain about the smoke inside but, it has never bothered me. The burrata salad is so freaking good!"}
{"text":"Fresh and quick food! The pastrami Reuben was pretty good, and of course I love they chose to open in downtown Pineville! Good for a quick bite.   ..went for a second time this afternoon, completely different experience so lowered my rating. Thankful for the front cashier that tried to make our experience better with a cookie though!"}
{"text":"We don't come to downtown Pineville much, so we decided to check this place out when we drove by. What a wonderful selection of sandwiches, sides and soups!  The Brie and Ham on pretzel bread was on point! My husband got the potato salad as a side and it was to die for. I want to go back because they have carrot bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream! So glad that we found this place."}
{"text":"We tried Flipside's Corner Grinder today after a recommendation from a friend.  The sandwiches were great and come with a side. Nice small sitting area, just enough tables. It was busy on a Saturday at lunch.  They use local bakeries for their breads, nice touch. We had the Cuban and the Pastrami sandwiches with loaded potato salad and pasta salad and tomato soups. No complaints, all were very good.  I will return."}
{"text":"We just happened to be in the area today so we stopped by for sandwiches. I tried the veggie with the loaded potato salad, and everyone else ordered the cheesesteak and Amy's Beef on Weck. Everything came out quickly and was so delicious. I wouldn't normally order potato salad, or even eat it without it being a special occasion, but I had to based on other reviews.  IT WAS AMAZING! You've gotta try it...it's a must!  We have grown accustomed to top notch customer service and everyone being so nice, and they did not disappoint. We were checked on regularly to find out if we were enjoying our food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So refreshing to know that a cool spot opened in the neighborhood besides The Dive in. I got the Rueben Panini and it was so good, the perfect amount of all the ingredients not one over powering the other, for a good price as well.. The fruit was fresh and the service was great! Definitely going to be coming back! Excited to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great corner location with parking across the street in quaint Pineville.  We stopped in around 2 PM for a couple fresh salads, placed our orders and grabbed a table.  The staff was  attentive as there were only a handful of patrons.  While we liked the place, and thought the food was good (I liked that my salad was lightly dressed), it was difficult to understand why it took almost 20 minutes to make.  Every order seemed to come out at a snails pace.  I couldn't imagine how a rush hour looks.   On the positive the food was fresh and locally sourced.  The blue cheese was stellar as was the bacon.  Portions were large requiring us to  doggy-bag some home.   I say Give 'em a Whirl!"}
{"text":"Incredibly Great Food Here!!!  We selected Flipside after being in the Arboretum area for an appointment.  We love local joints and selected this one based on, \"along your route,\" and Yelp.  Absolutely phenomenal choice and we are thankful.    Qucik Hit:  The food is locally sourced and wonderfully fresh.  I had the Amy's Beef on Weck, as I am a huge fan of a good roast beef sandwich.  The caraway bun was fresh, soft, and delicious and held its own against the juicy roast beef all the way to the end.  Beef was perfectly seasoned, tender, moist and absolutely delicious with a perfect amount of prepared horseradish. Nutshell:  BEST roast beef sandwich I have ever eaten.  My son got a Pastrami Reuben, which deviates from the standard reuben fare, but does so almost perfectly.  Nice, tender pastrami, not too peppery; fantastic swiss cheese and Lusty Monk mustard in place of T.I. dressing.  Although non-traditional, it comes together as an excellent Reuben.  Bread was fantastic, local and perfectly toasted.    Summary:  Depending on the route I take, it's 40 - 47 miles from where I live...which means I'll need to budget time when we return each month...and we will return at least monthly. Great Food, great prices, great people working there, and it is totally worth going out of your way to find comestible bliss!!!

{"text":"Amazing food! So fresh. Had the chicken salad sandwich and a house salad. The chicken salad was so fresh and the croissant was to die for. The ranch dressing was homemade and very good. Ended our lunch with an ice cream sandwich. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the loaded potato salad. The chicken salad sandwich was good- the croissant was very good. I did not like that they used the white portion of the lettuce on my sandwich rather than the green. I've read good reviews about the potato salad but it wasn't my favorite.. maybe potato salad just isn't my thing. I'll be back to try some of the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we wondered in for a very late lunch! The butternut squash soup with fig balsamic was delicious and perfect for a cold winter day. The salad was fresh and tasty as was the French dip. It's cute on the outside and inside and the employee who helped ous was so friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back. Bring your own cup in if you want to avoid styrofoam."}
{"text":"We were heading for a restaurant across the street only to find that it was closed!  We are not familiar with the old downtown Pineville so literally stumbled on Flipside.  There is a fuller Flipside in the Charlotte area which we liked, so got brave and entered this corner cafe.  So glad that we did.  Small and cozy, very open and clean.  Menus on the walls.  One gave daily specials the other many other options.  Mostly sandwiches, salads and soups.  But that is not really painting the full picture as to what they offer.  First off are their from scratch soups.  We ordered both a tomato and a mushroom soup.  The tomato soup had grilled cheese croutons!  Like miniature grilled cheese sandwiches they were cute and flavorful.  The tomato soup was really intensely tomato.  Dumb to say, but you just KNEW that you were eating tomato something.  Very thick, rich and tasty.  A meal in itself.  The mushroom soup was ground up mushrooms mixed with sherry wine and an added swirl of truffle oil. So rich and flavorful.  For me, it was too much sherry, but that is just my taste.  Enough to say that it was delicious and I drank it out of the paper bowl rather than using a spoon.  Two old ladies fainted from my inappropriate manners, but another two young ladies send me approving eyes and smiles.  My wife did not notice as she was deep into her tomato soup.  Their \"grinders\" are sandwiches.  We split Amy's beef on weck.  A handsome pile of shaved roast beef on an amazing soft caraway bun.  Very yummy.  And half, along with the good portion of soup was enough for lunch.  A weck, by the way is a German, Austrian, Slovene hard Kaiser roll known also as a kummelweck, among other names.  Pretty fancy!  Lots of sandwiches, which we will \"grind\" our way through over time, soups, salads, desserts and a pretty cool kids menu.  Grinds come with a side of your choice.   Drinks are self-serve fountain drinks, iced tea and other bottled or canned drinks are in cases.  And they do have coffee.  Nice people and interesting options.  Open until 8pm so they are a late morning coffee and pastry joint then a lunch place and then a dinner restaurant.    Their kitchen does good stuff. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Locally sourced everything, great sandwiches, and the staff is very friendly and always helpful.  Corner grind makes it into the lunch rotation at least twice a week.  Still trying out new things months later.  Ham & Brie Panini is a fave."}
{"text":"Pretty uncommon to walk into a restaurant you've never been to before and have everything go well, but fortunately today was one of those days.  I found out about this place by searching for 'cheesesteak' on Yelp and not only was this restaurant the closest, but well rated by locals! The restaurant itself has a very trendy vibe with muted colored matte walls and unique decor. The place screams 'buy local' with some of their suppliers proudly featured at the beginning of their overhead menu, as well as having some shelf-stable merchandise (like crackers, jams, mustards, honey, etc) from local vendors. A definite plus in my books!  So of course since I was searching for a cheesesteak I got the pressed cheesesteak sandwich with a side of 'loaded' potato salad. Sandwich was damn delicious, outstanding bread which was beautifully toasted. Real CARAMELIZED onions (not boiled, not sauteed to a blackened crisp, slow cooked the right way!), and plenty of cheese. Speaking of cheese, I think the norm is provolone (at least that's what most shops go with around here) but they went with what I believe is a sharp cheddar and it was a great change. I did think the sandwich was a bit lukewarm and the cheese hadn't even begun to melt. If I were at home I probably would have added sriracha as well, but still a good sandwich as-is.  The loaded potato salad was spot on. Either redskin or baby red potatoes with a good texture, not under cooked, and not boiled so long they disintegrate as soon as your fork touches them, just right. Seasoning was bright, crisp, fresh, truly noteworthy along with the great green onion, bacon, and cheese topping. I could have eaten 3 servings of the potato salad!  A great lunch experience today, and since they are a whopping 1/2 mile away from my office, I see many more trips to Flipside in my future!"}
{"text":"We were in downtown pineville when we stumbled upon flip side.  We decided to give it a try.  It was great!  Anne at the counter was very friendly!  The food was served quick and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my trip here! Made a last minute decision to come in based on seeing it was new on Yelp and having a dentist appt in the area. I decided to splurge on a Lobster Roll, but at $12 including a side, seemed to be reasonable. They had a wide selection of salads and sandwiches, plus an $8 special of the day, also including a side option. I ended up choosing a small Caesar salad as my side.   The lobster roll was delicious - warm toasted roll plus light mayo based lobster mix. The salad was ok, though I don't think I'd order it again next time based on the other sides they had available - namely pasta and potato salads.   Will definitely be back next time I'm down in Pineville."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and bringing life to small downtown Pineville. I stopped in for a quick lunch and tried the pressed beef/cheesesteak like sandwich. It was nothing exciting and I was a little shocked it had american cheese versus provolone but I went with it. On the other hand the loaded potato salad was amazing. I ate the whole thing on the ride home. I'll definitely be back and maybe customize my pressed beef sandwich"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on my Yelp hunt for an excellent sandwich and it hit the spot. Food was quick and delicious (highly recommend the ham and brie panini and pasta salad), and the staff was friendly. Neat setup and super clean! We need more outside the box affordable sandwich places like this."}
{"text":"Me and the wife had been there before and the food was wonderful. So when I had a chance Monday to stop in for lunch I was excited. I ordered the special: brisket, bacon and cheese on pressed bread. To my surprise the bacon was limp and chewy. Maybe I should have requested crispy. The brisket had sections of fat , which I am not a fan. I assumed the bread would be like a grilled cheese but it was buttered and kind of soggy. I will go back to give it another chance because the first time was so good. Everyone has a off day."}
{"text":"So my three stars is thought out. I was really excited to finally try this cute little corner place I. Such a sweet revived street in Pinevillle. We were walking around and I saw that they are possibly owned by Flipside, because I love that place in Fort Mill. We chose the pastrami Ruben because of the picture, and if you see my picture you can see where it was very disappointing. There is less than half the meat on my sandwich as opposed to the other one posted here. The overall flavor and taste was good, potato salad was good and we had the mushroom soup which wasn't hot, more lukewarm. To me three stars mean it's good, but there's no reason for me to promote it or go back. I will return to the actual Flipside, but probably not this one. Sandwich market is competitive!"}
{"text":"Totally love this place! The food is fresh and the bread tastes like it was made from scratch. Everything seems to be made from wholesome, real ingredients. I've had the cheesesteak, potato salad and banana pudding. All were delicious! Staff is very friendly and attentive; my husband ordered coffee in the middle of the day and they made a fresh pot. Easy parking right next door."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for the first time and really enjoyed my lunch! I got the burrata salad which comes in a large metal bowl, big portion! I've already been back a second time and got the veggie sandwich with a side house salad. Really cute and casual place for lunch. In downtown Pineville on the corner right beside a small free public parking lot."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. The food is really good! I've enjoyed everything I've gotten both times I've been. Unfortunately, the other consistency between both times I've been is an extraordinarily long wait time for lunch! It was crowded, but not crazy. I would not recommend going when you're hungry, but the food is really well done."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Friendly people, servings are large, food is delicious and it's a GREAT addition to the local restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches and sides! AND they deliver to Kit's Trackside across the street!  I've had a few of their sandwiches while I was having drinks at Kit's and the only one that I was disappointed in was the lobster roll - because it's lobster salad with various other ingredients, and not the traditional kind of lobster roll. The meatball sandwich was very good, and the loaded potato salad is DELICIOUS. Seriously, I know that you want to be healthy, especially to balance your beers across the street, but order that potato salad.   The inside of Corner Grind is cute, warm and a little smokey. But still super enjoyable. I can see how it would get too crowded and become slow to get food.   You can thank me for the potato salad, and say hi to Kit and his team for me!"}
{"text":"Great little local restaurant. The grinders are great. The gluten free bread is wonderful. The staff is super friendly and it's a cool atmosphere! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are excellent the salads are wonderful Plus you can get your food here and go right next door to pint Ville and have a beer. Plus they have red dragon cheddar cheese if you've not have it you seriously need to try it."}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the butternut squash bisque and house salad. Hubby had turkey grinder and chili. Great flavors in both. Upscale flavors in this local diner."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch Super Bowl Sunday, and glad we did. Lots of options for grinders, sandwiches and salads, and everything we had was good. My son and I both had the Cuban grinder, which is very good.  of meat, and the spicy mustard had a kick to it and made the sandwich. The kettle chips are awesome. My Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law both had the chicken salad, and raved about it. And my wife had the Grinder chopped salad, which was large enough for 2-3 people. The service was good, and the young ladies working the day we went were all very nice. Wouldn't hesitate to stop in  here again."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food at a great price and such a cozy corner spot in downtown Pineville. You should try the load potato salad!"}
{"text":"Really good soups. The tomato was good. Not anything spectacular but still a yummy classic. The butternut squash was divine! It had such yummy fall flavors. I was so glad I got it because I would've been hungry otherwise.   The grilled cheese sandwich was the worst I've ever had. The flavors did not pair well together. The cheese wasn't melted. There were apples involved. I was confused and hungry."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they were closed when we arrived at 5:45, even though their Yelp info said 9:00 pm"}
{"text":"Took a number of items as carry out. The loaded potato salad, chili and chicken salad sandwich were outstanding. Lobster roll was mediocre. The sandwich bread was particularly tasty. Like a croissant only more body. It was a comfortable and pleasant environment for a casual meal."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of meat on my sandwich. I enjoyed the potato salad.Great little surprise in Pineville."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. I was expecting a lot more than I received due to the great reviews. I got the veggie sandwich, antipasto salad, BLT . All this to go, but from the moment they handed me the food till I got to my car that was parked next to them.. my sandwich was soggy ! Literally soaked in what seemed like balsamic. The antipasto salad had huge chunks of cheap cheddar cheese and just wasn't pleasant at all. Definitely will not be returning here, I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is an adorb local spot. Their food is sourced locally which is always a plus. Flipside is known for its sandwiches aka grinders. I went against the grain and ordered a spinach salad and a bowl of soup. The spinach salad is delicious. The dressing balanced the whole dish. I decided to forgo the $4 option to add a meat since I ordered soup also.  The tomato soup comes with GRILLED CHEESE CROUTONS - such a genius idea!! I loveddd the soup ($5) and it will be my go to order."}
{"text":"Many locals know Flipside for the their restaurants in Fort Mill and Rock Hill, SC which come with some rave reviews. This is their first venture across the state line in NC. The restaurant in located in downtown Pineville near the railroad tracks.  This is a different concept than their other two restaurants. This is of the fast casual variety. You order at the counter of a list of grinders (pressed sandwiches), salads and sides and daily specials. You get a number, grab your drink and find a table and wait for your order.  I had the meatball grinder an a side caesar salad. The meatballs in the grinder were very savory and the sauce was great as well. I was eating that with my fork. The bread was good but I didn't think this idea worked well as a pressed sandwich. By the time my sandwich arrived the bread was mostly broken already so the meatballs didn't stay in the sandwich. The salad was good though.  My coworker had one of their weekly specials, a pulled pork sandwich topped with mac n cheese that he thought was great but not as good as items we've had at their Fort Mill location.  However, this is a new concept for Flipside. The people were friendly and helpful in explaining this concept. And downtown Pineville needs a casual restaurant like this. I will be back and I sure hope this does well here. It certainly got busy after we arrived."}
{"text":"Love the Flipside Café, so I was pumped when we found out this location opened closer to us. I stopped in for lunch on a Monday, and unfortunately, I was disappointed. The meat in the Philly steak sandwich I had was a bit tough, and I thought it could have had more grilled peppers and onions. Although the meat on the Philly was plentiful, my husband's chicken salad croissant was another story. There were about three pieces of chicken, and the rest of the \"chicken salad\" was grapes. I also didn't really care for the pasta salad, which was really more of a macaroni salad because it was drenched in mayo. It also had large chunks of cheese in it. The cheese was good, but the chunks were so huge, it was hard to taste anything else. Ultimately, I think I'll be driving a little farther to the Flipside Café rather than returning to the Corner Grind."}
{"text":"Was not happy with the Friday special today. It used to be a panini-pressed sandwich packed to the brim with shrimp, andouille and veggies. Was not the case today when I got essentially a sub that was ungrilled and had half the contents of usual. I may still come back some day but may give up on the Friday special. Lastly, it took 15 minutes to get my food and they weren't even crowded when I came in either! Disappointing :("}
{"text":"Many in our co-worker lunch group had been here before my visit and had high remarks. Having not-so good experiences in this location with previous tenants so I was curious to see what the new place had to offer!  This spot is known to be small, so at peak times it could be hard to find a seat. They have a nice black board with menu items and daily specials for your choosing. You order at the front counter and are give a number flag as your food will be brought to you.  I landed on the cuban and a side of loaded baked potato salad. They bring your food out on a small metal sheet pan with wax paper.. kind of a neat, different idea. The potato salad was just plopped down on the paper, and boy was it tasty! The cuban was also very good. Everyone at the table enjoyed what they had ordered. One of my co-workers ordered a bowl of chili. It came out without presentation - just poured into a to-go bowl. He would've appreciated a slice of bread or crackers as is traditional with chili, maybe they'll reconsider!  All in all it was a great first trip! Look forward to stopping back by... See ya on the Flipside!"}
{"text":"Ive lived in Pineville for 12 years an this place just opened not long ago. We've had 2 different places try to make it in this spot both failed sadly.  But Flipside is gonna made it , great food choices an great portions I got the turkey bacon on sourdough with potato salad with bacon. Wow it blew me away the turkey sliced deli style an that crisp bacon an mayonnaise.  It was a perfect sandwich ill be back for sure. Welcome to Pineville. Also they use an sell Dukes bread a local bakery another great reason to visit them."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  Not fancy -- this is for the hipsters and melennials who are looking for a sandwich before hitting the new brew-pubs across the street (and next door, and down the street, and...).  Great sandwiches and a selection of drinks."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Can get pretty busy on a Friday night because of the next door bars Pintville and Trackside Craft Beer. Friendly staff. Hopefully they will stay open late for the beer crowd."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite sandwich shop around Charlotte.  Great variety with a unique flair. Been here at least ten times. Excellent food and service every time."}
{"text":"Tried the daily special, a sloppy joe with pimento cheese and crispy onions and a side.  Food was good, the side was a mini Caesar that was a meal all in itself.  Another good restaurant from the flipside group."}
{"text":"Went on the BOB ( Best of Best of Charlotte) recommendation and were not disappointed. Below is a veggie sandwich with arugula, mozzarella, picked onions,etc.My dh  had a lobster roll and son had a smoked salmon and cream cheese. All were spot-on.   Store front on the main drag of Pineville. Two nice craft breweries right there and two antique stores. Lots of browsing. Parked on the street."}
{"text":"After some exhausting necessary shopping at Carolina Place Mall, we planned to go to the Waldhorn. We had a bad experience before we were even served and left starving, looking for something close. Yelp showed this little place open just down the street from the mall - somewhat of a hidden gem. Locally inspired sandwiches and side in a historic looking downtown shop. I had chicken salad - pecans, grapes, celery, just right on a buttery brioche bun. My guy had a sub with homemade meatballs - some of the best I've ever tasted - fresh  marinara and mozzarella on a crusty toasted bread, was really good. The sides, which include a pasta salad with cheese and a loaded baked potato salad, were fresh and tasty.  Reasonably priced and delicious. I had written this giving five stars but we saw the guy who was making food /no gloves eating while he worked just before we left and that was a bummer.   **Update: the issue was remedied immediately and owner reached out.   Revisited today... excellent. Changing to 5 star. Had a really good lobster roll. Tasted soup, excellent, will be back in fall to have all of them! Highly recommend - delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious. We came for lunch on a Saturday. Cute little place with random tables. Go up to counter and order, given a number, and they bring it to you. We ordered the Beef Wick, without caraway bun, mushroom soup, side potato salad and we split. More than enough for us. The beef wick was good, beef was tender, but I realized I'm not a horseradish person, came with au jus for dipping. Bread was toasty and Delish. It comes with a side and we picked potato salad. Score!!!Potato salad was homemade for sure. So good! It had a generous amount of chopped bacon and a spattering of cheddar and green onions. The mushroom soup came with a dollop of crema, drizzle of truffle oil and a splash of sherry! Holy shitballs, so decadent!! Can't wait to try some of the daily specials and another type of sandwich. So cute, so quaint, so delicious.  Tip: they also sell Greek olive oil, fresh mozzarella and buratta!!"}
{"text":"Had the best Italian sandwich along with their Ceasar salad oh and the butter nut squash soup! Absolute delicious. My parents & I really enjoyed the food here. Fresh & light. It's also super cute with their wood pieces. I will absolutely be going back here. Just moved to Charlotte a week now."}
{"text":"I love you Flipside!  We live close to Pineville, so decided to give this place a try, based on the positive reviews.  It was a breath of fresh air to receive food that was high quality and made in house.  The food was incredible and presented well.  I ordered the Caesar Salad and the Mushroom Soup.  The salad was perfect and I will be dreaming about that mushroom soup - if only I have leftovers.  My husband had a delicious club and tomato soup, not a bite left to be had.  We brought our kids and the kids meals were very plentiful.  The kids cheesesteak was so yummy!  I had to have a bite.  It  is very kid friendly and many families were there.  We were told many people bring their food into Pintville and their menus are there...Will definitely plan to do that soon.  I am so thrilled to have another reason to visit Downtown Pineville.  If you live nearby or in the area, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Shopping in Pineville and trusted Yelp once again. 4 of us eating for $44 and everyone was full and happy.   I had the short rib chili-as a side, tons of meat and very delicious. Pastrami Rueben was very nice, mustard spicy and delicious. my wife had the pressed cheese steak with salad- cleaned the plate so I didn't get to taste it. Said it was very good.  Daughter had lobster roll and Caesar salad. Lobster was sweet and delicious salad disappeared before I could try.   Son had meat ball parm with kettle chips. Sauce and meat balls were delicious. All the bread was off the charts!    Try this place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place, my wife got the chicken salad sandwich and she loved it. I got the. Big Blt and was disappointed, it was smaller than a BLT one would get from IHOP, it would be nice if you could build your own Grinder. Being from New England I was expecting a big sub like sandwich not a normal sandwich."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in for lunch..  Such a wonderful and quaint place! The food was delicious! The staff was simply wonderful and very helpful! Everything is made in house and what isn't is locally sourced! You must go! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good! Ham and Brie on a pretzel roll was amazing. My wife had the chicken salad which was also delicious."}
{"text":"So we were looking for something to eat for lunch today, and wanted to door dash, and nobody was in the mood for anything exotic or foreign so we settled on this place.  We ordered 4 sandwhichs, 1 Beef on Weck, 1 Reuben, 1 Cuban and 1 Cheesesteak.   Amy you are on point with this beef on weck, I am from upstate New York and this is a hometown classic. You guys really have your sandwhich making skills down. The roast beef was phenomonal, nice juicy thick medium rare cuts with that horseradishy sauce smeared on that bun with the au jus dip was just amazing. It was the tastiest little sandwhich I've had in a while. I should have ordered 2. The antipasta was a nice little garnish to go with it. Overall everyond loved the sandwiches and I will definitely be back to try more of the menu items.  Amy I don't know if you are from New York but thank you so much for having a place that offers beef on weck around here. You really made my day today."}
{"text":"Best subs ever!  Shared the Italian and the roast beef with my husband.  Both were incredible!!!!  The potato salad was amazing as well. Super cute inside!  I can't wait to go back and try the soups and other suns!"}
{"text":"I love(d) their chicken salad, we stopped by 2 days ago and it looked like they were closed.  Such a shame!!!!  Bad news for the building, but good news for everyone!   Get well soon, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food. The sandwiches were delicious and different and the sides were amazing as well.  so good can't wait to go back. We had the chicken salad sandwich and an awesome side salad and a stuffed meatball sandwich with loaded potato salad"}
