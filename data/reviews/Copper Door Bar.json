{"text":"I can't say much about this bar since I had only been here for a couple of times. It was recommended by a friend of mine and I went there one night. Drinks were great though."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar , good drinks, nice bartenders. Downfall: cash only"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but thoroughly unimpressed. When we walked in the bartender was outside smoking and told us she would \"be right in.\" We waited several minutes before she returned, seeming annoyed. She then left once again to go smoke. After the first pitcher we asked to order another and she audibly signed"}
{"text":"First time here... Came especially for the Iowa/Iowa state game.  Place was packed! Great beer prices AND free maid rites during the game!!! Will probably be back for more Iowa games!!"}
{"text":"Found this place through Team Trivia. They have it Friday nights at 7 then karaoke afterwards. Everyone here was super friendly!  A couple people came over and introduced themselves, even the owner. She's from Iowa so there's lots of Iowa football memorabilia hanging around. Cash only and the drinks are super cheap. Wish there was a better beer selection and they served local beer. If you live close to here, check it out!"}
{"text":"We have been going a lot of years and have seen a lot changes. Take credit cards, team trivia on Fridays and karakoe Fri and Sat.  Huge Iowa following and great for football! Great friendly bartenders and prices are good."}
{"text":"Creepy bar scene hahahaha Good thing I was in good company.  The drinks were strong at least, perhaps to mask the weird people that show up.    Glendale bars are weird man"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the bar on Saturday during the day. Connie was the bartender and was super on top of our drinks all day. We all felt very comfortable in the business and had a great time.  The clientele are mostly the local crowd and were pretty friendly. The music was good and played through the jukebox all day. I would definitely recommend this bar to anyone that would normally enjoy a dive bar atmosphere.  Thanks for the great day!"}
{"text":"The Copper Door is quite possibly the greatest bar in Pheonix. Claudia is a sassy minx who truly knows how to treat her patrons. Go visit, sing some karaoke, have a stiff drink and enjoy the friendly people also imbibing in refreshments at the local watering hole."}
{"text":"This is a great dive bar. They have cheap drinks, a great staff, pool, darts, other games and a ton of TV's. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a relaxing night out."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you. Copper Door bar is a kick ass place if your a football fan.  A buddy of mine that i work with brought me to this neighborhood bar of his years ago. It's pretty much your typical hole in the wall neighborhood bar. But this place is filled with good natured and good hearted people. If your a Bears Fan, there's a section of Bears fans there. If your a Browns fan. There is a guy who every Sunday comes with his Browns helmet, sports towel, jersey, and any other Brown stuff you can think of. Sets it up in a corner and cheers on his Browns like there the #1 team in the league. Despite how rowdy the crowd might seem there. they are all pretty friendly there. They're just passionate about their teams. But everyone is all smiles and laughs. Don't be surprise if someone buys you a drink there just because they are in a good mood. The bartenders are all cool as hell. They make good drinks and there alot cheaper then some of the other places people go to have a drink. You can get a long island ice tea there for $5. There are TV's all over the place with all the games on. There not huge TV's and they aren't the sharpest HD's. But the experience at Copper Door on Football Sundays out weights the TV's. Besides after awhile most of people are drunk and don't care. There is always free popcorn to be consumed. I'm not going to lie though. That popcorn is going to kill someone in there one day. Don't be surprised if you look around the bar and see people gagging on that damn popcorn. There was few times i thought i was going to die on the floor at that bar choking on that popcorn. That would've been a sad way to go.  They also have free biscuits and gravy on Sunday mornings. You can only get it if you buy a drink. They are always having free food there for some reason. When someone has a birthday party there. The people always invite other people to have some of the food after the initial party guest had their food. The Copper Door has karaoke on Friday nights as well. Make sure you bring cash. As they don't do debit or credit. Just good ole American cash."}
{"text":"This bar is AWESOME! Great people, wonderful staff, very open excepting loving neighborhood people. I walked into that bar 2 years ago with my sister in law. One of the regulars bought us a pitcher.... And didn't try to get in our pants! Lol he just wanted us to feel welcome and have a good time. The bar tenders are great, fun and friendly. I've brought so many different types of people here and have NEVER had a bad time. I guess I am a regular now!"}
{"text":"They don't have food the place is small and the meseed up thing is I'm a guy and had to take goto the bathroom the men's bathroom toilet doesn't have a stall and the door doesn't lock so I had to use the women's bathroom to take a number 2 .... The bar tender was very nice though and drinks were good and refreshed often ... Biggest part I'm a man and didn't want to use the women's bathroom but hey u do what u got to do ... My suggestion for the bar put a lock on the men's room so people can take a dump"}
{"text":"This is a dive among dives. Used to go there on occasion, because a friend insisted, but I never cared for it. Disgusting doesn't even begin to describe the bar, the customers, or the people that work there.  The mixed drinks are watered down and the beer is usually flat.  The customers and the people that work there all look like they live in trailer parks and are on meth."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times and it used to be decent, but this ultra mega bitch bartender has ruined it for me.Last 3 times I've been there she always leaves the bar to go out and smoke and talks with all the regulars. I get it..it's a local dive bar and you chat with the regulars, but you disrespect anyone new. We asked for another beer and she sighed bc apparently she wanted to go home. Other night someone threw up in the bathroom so she flipped and kicked everyone out of the bar. My friend and her got in a fight bc she was telling him he needed to finish his beer. Cash only? Yup. Place sucks, don't go.Probably one of the worst bars I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Truly a neighborhood bar. Didn't know anyone here, and didn't leave without catching  everyone's name. Maybe not as wide of a beverage selection as the pizzeria-turned-bar in the same lot, but definitely lots more fun. Will return."}
{"text":"A  solid blue collar hang out,  some regulars go back 20 plus years!  Proprietors are the best kind of people,"}
