{"text":"So I'll start by saying I took a late flight home to Vegas .. we we're starving and a friend had recommended Cafe Verdi said it's open late . So we tried it . Everything was excellent we had the pizza it was great . The Philly melted in my mouth . And my husband has been back for the monster burger 2 more times lol dining room spotless our server Rachelle awesome so I say 5 star all the way from the excellent food and service .."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their wings and runnin blt. They are very quick. Mind you on holidays they will be busy because they are one of the few restaurants that are 24/7. They work hard and fast, so on those days just be patient!"}
{"text":"Got pizza delivered and pizza was cold and I had asked for mild wings and got just wings"}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta were great, you can definitely taste the difference in their dough, it's outstanding! It's a great place to eat with exceptional service. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered a philly steak and wings for my first time here, and they were both AMAZING. I had a lot of special instruction for my sandwich also and they got it all correct and then some. I'm ordering more tonight for my nephew to try! So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"i love this place! i come all the time with my family.The monster burger is just fricking awesome!salads are made fresh and the pizza are the best!they have the very friendliest staff i ever met\"Thumbs up!; ')"}
{"text":"Pretty cool that they're now open 24 hours. Very convenient that they deliver to all areas of vegas (including my area of east lv that doesn't always get serviced via delivery). I've ordered from them many times, usually only getting the same things though, the philly cheesecake and fries with extra fries on the side which is pretty tasty. Sometimes they're late lol but it's okay, my fries are usually always fresh (although I've heard many others complain about soggy fries)."}
{"text":"I recommend this place its a very good place they have very delicious food. Me and my wife loved this place the costumer service was really nice everything was awesome. We loved it."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is legit and the people are super chill! Love the way the huge burgers taste!"}
{"text":"Im keep getting amazed by their food. Love the calzones. I recommend all who wants to try New York style. Try this place out."}
{"text":"Just got my food deliverd it is exelent as always. Thank you for beeing on time and bringing my family hot fresh food. I love your calzone dont change it please."}
{"text":"Heard Cafe Verdi just changed owners so i had to stop by and try it out. The place has been remodeled cleaned changed around. The food was amazing. I had the chicken fajita with frys and a slice of pizza and it was great. The employees were very nice and the prices were very reasonable. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Ok  - slowest delivery ever!  But my food was good.  Ordered a calzone.  Not your typical calzone.  this reminded me of the deep fried pizza I used to get back east.  Although not deep fried  - it just had that texture and taste of pizza compared to a calzone.   It was really good - a little greasy but still good.  Also had a piece of apple pie.  Ok  you would have thought they would have pulled it out of the freezer while I waited for 1 hours and 20 minutes for a delivery on a Friday afternoon,   I think it was mrs smith's pie.   but I like mrs smiths so I cant really take away a start for that.  will definite order from here again - will need to make that order at say 11 so I can eat at 12:30."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 meals from this place.  All I can say is I probably won't order from here again.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and my son ordered the chicken Alfredo.  On a good note the food arrived at my door and was very hot.  That's the end of my good review.  First off my expectations dropped dramatically when I looked at my meal and realized that they chopped up packaged, previously frozen chicken fingers as the chicken breast.  The rest of the meal continued to meet that high standard.  The marinara sauce was flavorless and soupy.  The pasta was over done and there was too much cheese on it.  My sons meal could only be called Alfredo in that it was a white sauce.  Other than that it was also flavorless and so loose that it didn't even cling to the pasta.  I don't know how their pizza is but the lack of care and poor food product they put out for the two most expensive items on their menus does not give me confidence they can do anything well."}
{"text":"Almost two hours after I ordered, I called to check what was taking so long since I had been quoted 45-50 minutes. She said it would still be at least 15-20 minutes! It's now 1:15 am and I'll be going to bed hungry because I don't want to be up any longer. The lady on the phone is very rude too. No help at all. Pick anywhere else. You'll be thankful you did."}
{"text":"So I ordered a meal from here. They told me 45-50 min till delivery. I waited for an hour and 20 minutes and still no food. Wait time was too long"}
{"text":"I had the Margarita pizza and zucchini fries...fries too soggy, pizza pretty doggone good, esp for this vegetarian...its nice to eat something besides the routine cheese or veggie selection...that's why i gave the 4*. Husband had the hawaiian pizza, he was \"it's okay\". Service was great, however. We had delivery."}
{"text":"First time using this company and took forever to get here , then the delivery guy was all rude about not getting a tip. He were going to tip him but he gave us a additude and told us it was 13 dollares, and Even WORST THEY FORGOT MY FRIES!!!!!! Paid 30 dollares and didnt get what i wanted  FIRST AND LAST TIME USING THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"I woke up at 11:30p STARVING! I looked around for places that were open for pick up. I came across Cafe Verdi and I am very happy that I made that choice! The service was quick, they called me before I got there I was expecting a 30 or so minute wait but within 10-15 minutes of calling in my order, it was already ready to go! Will definitely come back for middle of the week late night munchies!"}
{"text":"DON'T get the fettuccine Alfredo. It's seriously trash. Chicken is obviously frozen. The fettuccine was undercooked. The Alfredo was literally just Butter. Wasn't even seasoned! Worst ever."}
{"text":"Hits the spot every time!! My go to pizza spot at any hour of the day. Can't go wrong with a classic pepperoni or just plain cheese. I've also tried their tortellini which was amazing. Ordered the family size and it was plenty! Can definitely feed 4-5 people off that."}
{"text":"I order a black n chicken salad and  as I'm eating I see something moving in my salad. I look and there is a bug that's still alive in it. I'm super disgusted and disappointed. I will not be ordering again from this place. If there's bugs in the salad there's probably roaches and some other shit in the rest of the food. Gross and I hope they give me my money back because this is just NASTY!!!!"}
{"text":"the burger was great !! best one ive had yet ! deffinetly recommend the bacon cheeseburger, the fries on the other hand were cold and soggy  , delivery took more than hour to get here i ordered and confirmed at 2:28 PM and recieved it until 3:50 and the wings were not good at all they were still cold from the middle..well most likely not order from  here again .."}
{"text":"So far this place has delicious food. Their onion rings are delicious, their pizza is delicious and their hamburgers are delicious as well! Will continue to order from here... delivery was fast (:, thanks for the amazing food!"}
{"text":"fast delivery and good food. The monster burger is so worth it! I probably wont buy the chicken wings again but everything else will probably be purchased in the future."}
{"text":"Fried zucchini was soggy, the breading had no flavor. The wings however were amazing. And the Philly cheese steak calzone was perfect. Every bite had cheese, steak, and peppers. Just don't order anything fried"}
{"text":"I have been to their other restaurant on the east side many times and I love it but it was a bit far from where I live.  I was so excited to hear they just opened a new location in the west side right in the walmart plaza on Ft. Apache.  Had to try to see if its just as good and it was the same amazing taste.  Their pizza's are the best in town."}
{"text":"I had late lunch with my daughter and nephews.  We had pizza, fries and I had to try the chicken fajita and I have to say everything was delicious, especially the pizza dough and there fries is one of the best fries I've had.  We dined in and service was awesome, staff was very friendly..."}
{"text":"This place is friggen bomb, they have great pick up specials, and just great food plus they're willing to deliver pretty much anywhere in Vegas!!! As much as people complain about the delivery \"taking too long/The meal was cold\" I can honestly say after a shizzznapple of delivery orders ordered NOT ONCE was it that!!!!! There dough, & there ingredients, basically everything is on point... Not to mention the wings... if you want great ass-tonishing food call Cafe Verdi, Grosse Pointe Blank PERIOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I ordered delivery and the staff called to verify my order, it was delivered faster than expected and the food was amazing. I'll definitely continue to give them business"}
{"text":"You can't expect much from a late night place. The Claymont sandwich was good for It being a late night order. That is why It got 3 stars. Whatever you do don't order the \"chicken piccata\" It was more of a bowl of spaghetti with lemon juice with sliced bland tasteless chicken. (I didn't take a pic Bc Once I tasted it last night It was in the trash)"}
{"text":"I was having a hard time finding a place to deliver us a pizza at 3am, i came across this place, first i was hesitant to order( because of low reviews) but honestly i got my food in 40 minutes and it was great...."}
{"text":"Simply. I love it. The new management did excellent job. The food is still the best and the customer service is perfect now. Thank you for the great food and service keep it up."}
{"text":"Excellent Calzones!!!They have the best food ,outstanding service .I will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"I can honestly not tell you what this food is like when you're sober, but when it's late at night and you are home, and you need food, they come through and satisfy those urges. I don't even know where the store is located, because I'm always at the point where I need it delivered when I order.   I've tried the pizza, the wings, burgers and sandwiches, and nothing has disappointed. I probably wouldn't go when I was sober, but hey! I'll definitely order again when I'm not!"}
{"text":"So far I have no food. But customer service sucks! Ok so now that I've eaten, this was the best idea my fiancé ever had. It was delicious and so much of it!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings, subs, salads and pizzas are fabulous,the rest of the stuff I haven't tried yet. I usually eat there on my lunch. The inside is way different now, it looks more people friendly and relaxing with the t.v.'s. I just wish I could find that man that works there on the menu cause he sure looks delicious."}
{"text":"After ordering over 20 times.... Ive given up. Last 4 or 5 times were wrong, took forever or uncooked. I got my money back but to me its gone downhill in the last month. New cook maybe? All i know is. Im done. Sadly.   As for this place. I think we eat here more then anywhere else. Love their pizza, wings sandwich and even salads.  This is worth it"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying my son, Sam, says the food is great, and he knows a thing or two about good food.  You see, I am actually writing my very happy review about the service I (we) received.  Yesterday, the day after the horrible attack in Vegas, I wanted to do something for my son and his girlfriend to make their day a bit easier to tackle, and I know Sam and Mia love Café Verdi Rebel.  Minor detail...I live in Washington State...But, thanks to the very kind woman who answered the phone, and the fact that they have a secure, on-line ordering system, as well, I got to be the \"mom\" and my kids felt the love.  HOW COOL IS THAT?   So, upon review:   Food:  terrific Service: phenomenal Delivery Time: Very Fast Ability/Ease of Ordering On-Line: Foolproof!   Thank you, Café Verdi Rebel for helping me make their day better even from here.   God bless you."}
{"text":"Decent food, lousy service in the restaurant. They seem to be way more concerned about the call in orders. I had to go and ask for my drink, and it was then that the cashier seemed to realize my order had not been put in. She didn't check on me until I was done, when it was too late to ask for a drink refill. Definitely not worth the money with so many other places in the area."}
{"text":"I always order from them ! The chicken Alfredo pasta comes with a side salad and garlic bread omg ! So bomb it feeds 2-3 people !! They always on time very friendly I love the food here we also ordered the pepperoni pizza  to bomb ?"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying those 90% of the people who eat here use the delivery service. Don't even try to find the place, it's tucked away behind two bars with just one small door that says \"Cafe Verdi Rebel\".  I've gotten the baked spaghetti with extra pasta twice now and it is AMAZING for the price. I'm a huge pasta fiend and they make very good pasta. Not the best, but probably the best you'll find at this affordable price.  The delivery service isn't the quickest, but 45-1:10 and it'll be there.  The one time I did pop in the store to pick up my order it smelled very bad, like sewer? I think a line may have been busted. Almost didn't want to pick up my food at the point. Hopefully they've fixed the problem by now."}
{"text":"I waited over 2 hours for a small personal pizza and 3 chicken fingers. I live less than 5 miles away. I had to call twice and was told the second time the driver forgot my pizza and was delayed. My food wasn't hot when it arrived, but dealing with the restaurant at 2:30 am seemed like a waste of breath. The food still tasted great, just wish I didn't have a bad experience my very first time ordering from this shop."}
{"text":"For some reason I just really wanted some pancakes for lunch! so i ordered from here because its one of the only places that delivers them? I saw they were 7 dollars so i figured I was in for some bad ass pancakes. Boy was I dissapointed....  delivery took a long time. the onion rings were soggy rather than crispy. The pancakes cost 7 bucks and they give you 5 mini pan cakes that are very thin. I am not impressed @ all. I mean I could have gotten same or better quality from mcdonalds and paid a lot less..... ....  I got a sandwhich with the pancakes. After eating some of the food I can not recommend this place. The pancakes are small, poorly prepared, overcooked I ate part of one and threw the rest away.... the au jus that came with the sandwich was super super super salty like unbelievable salty.  Waste of my money.   Not happy.  ..... lol...... meh eek methinks not!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place, it's not wroth it. We order delivery from this place which took them 2 hours to deliver to our hotel room. When we received our pizza, which was in an oven bag, the pizza was cold and hard to chew. They didn't even provided us with plates, condiments, and napkins."}
{"text":"I just discovered for me another nice place to have lunch. Very nice place, excellent service, delicious food! Definitely five star!"}
{"text":"The best pizzas in town! Every ingredient was fresh and baked to perfection. Besides Cafe Verdi's  delicious food, their service was outstanding. I am very pleased with my experience and will revisit soon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were left on hold for 35 minutes just to be told orders over $50 couldn't be placed on the phone. Then we were literally laughed at when we expressed our frustration."}
{"text":"I would give it a 1 star if it wasn't for the food. We came in to give this place a try during lunch and noticed that we were the only ones there. The lady up front didn't say a word to us, no greeting or anything. She seemed kind of angry. We ordered pasta and a sub, but we ended up waiting 50 minutes for our food! Should've just went to the Thai place next door."}
{"text":"Great little place off the beaten path. Great place to stop in to eat before a movie. Had the Flam-in-go chicken sandwich which was great. Server was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"After a long night of being out I decided to try this restaurant for the delivery services. It was 3am when I ordered & they told me it would take 45 mins. It actually took about a hour and half & I was almost ready to cancel my order. I give it a 3 stars strictly based on time. The food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food at 2am. It arrived at 4:30am. Est time of deliver was 45 minutes. Pretty upset because I pre tipped otherwise I would have just closed the door."}
{"text":"Verdi is sweet and fresh. The fries were hot and great. There menu looks adorable and I'll be ordering from CVRebel again"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food AND service. I don't really like to do negative reviews, but this place is seriously not what I was hoping for. My Philly was the worst and I would never go here again. Steer clear, unless you have a lot more gumption than I do! Cheers :D"}
{"text":"I never review a restaurant based on one try... I always wait a few times to discover inconsistencies before I review. These folks are consistently good quality and friendly.   Bacon Cheeseburger: Best one I've ever had delivered from any restaurant. It was delicious! Gourmet fresh sesame bun, huge, juicy, cheeseburger patty, fresh garnishes. Yummmm hit the spot.   Fries: still hot and crunchy when they arrived. Amazing.   Eclair: Delicious  Cheese Pizza: Tasty. Good crust.   Chef Salad: generous fresh portions. BUT, Had to cut it up before I could eat it. Awkward with plastic utensils.   Chicken Strips: Had no idea they were in Buffalo sauce. Thought they were just fried chicken strips. No idea if they were good or not because I don't eat buffalo anything.  but they looked good... ( I took one star away for the chicken strips.)  They are courteous and their food is always hot and good quality! That goes a long way! Plus, they deliver things other than pizza! BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Tried to place an order on yelp and it didn't go through so I figured I would call the restaurant and I spoke to the manager Rachel who proceeded to argue with me for five minutes over whether or not I had put my credit card in to the order. No matter how many times I explain that the order wasn't completed she didn't seem to understand, or more accurately didn't want to understand. I will be calling the place to speak to the owner in the morning to let them know that they missed out an order because instead of simply taking my order I got five minutes of attitude from Rachel"}
{"text":"I been reading all of the comments and I just got to say this alot of this is not true alot of people get mad because they order food then complain about it after to get money back or more food I worked in a few different Pizza places and believe me you'll be surprised on how many people will lie to your face for free food or Money back after they eat everything up. it's the only place that delivers 24 hours seven days a week half of the city orders from here  it's the only place open beside Denny's or Ihop  don't forget if  your in a hotel in Vegas security won't let anyone up unless your staying there and have a key to your room a few hotel's won't let outside food in no one knows that.but the food is fresh  great service it's not little caesars or Dominos 30 minutes or less where  everything is pre cooked manager Rachel takes care of us every time we order went in a few times to dine in very clean restaurant I don't see anything worng with this place it takes 45 minutes to one hour for delivery time in any real restraint because it's real cooked food goodness takes a little time great place to eat what's this eat 24 and all these online ways to order food make a Dame phone call people order your food lazy people don't get anywhere what's worng in this world"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Good service.  Kids loved it and very affordable.  We had delivered to us while staying in casino hotel.  Crossed wires and somehow we missed delivery?   But the delivery guy was great to us.  I would order again but pick up this time."}
{"text":"I ordered a Greek Salad and a pizza  The pizza was really good!!! But the Greek salad was awful the only thing on it was tomatoes, red onion, and feta cheese! A Greek salad comes with Red onion, tomato, feta cheese, pepper Cheney, beats, black olives! So disappointed!!!! Pretty much was an oversize garden salad with feta cheese thrown on top and they also sent me Ranch dressing instead of Greek dressing"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 Breakfast Sandwiches at 3am. I call at 3:50am to ask what the status was. The girl had major attitude and tells me another 30 min really 1 hour and 20 minutes for 2 breakfast sandwiches and an order pancakes. Forget it I will NEVER order from there EVER again."}
{"text":"I always order from here and this is the first time I'm having issues with them. The first time my food had hair in it and I called them to tell them. The guy who answered the phone just said \"okay\". And I asked if they could take this food back and send me th order again. and they were nice enough to do so.  Last time I ordered Mexican burger from them, there was no meat patty in it. I am vegetarian and therefore it is perfect. This time there is a meat patty in it. So I call back again telling them I'm confused and I wanted no meat.  The person on the phone said \"let me call the owner because this is the second time you are calling with issues with the order.\" I apologized to them for the inconvenience and offered to bring the food back to them."}
{"text":"My coworkers and i have literally been ordering from them two weeks straight because their food is that amazing!! They already know my name and what i usually order lol. We've tried so many different menu items, and each one has never disappointed us. Their delivery is also super fast and the food always comes very fresh and still super hot! Their customer service is also definitely on point as the cashiers and the driver are all so friendly! They have lunch specials too and the prices are so good for what they give you! Definitely will continue to order from them!!"}
{"text":"While at work decided on delivery instead of food available onsite.  BRemembered having their pizza along time ago and it was great.  So ordered bacon burger and fries.   Delivery was on time and courtious.  The burger was hot cooked properly and yummy.  Fries were also yummy.   Recommend all give Verdi a shot"}
{"text":"Amazing food as always. The BBQ chicken pizza is great and the basic cheese pizza is perfectly done. Great customer service like usual. Definitely a place to grab quick good food."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever! Came in from s long flight and only wanted food.. took them 2 hours to deliver! Food was cold, and order wasn't right. Left message for supervisor 3 times but never gave me a call. Also was informed no refund the most would be 10% off which I would never use cause I would never trust them again! Plus I'm from another state on the other side so this may be my first and last trip here. So ridiculous. They deserve a ZERO"}
{"text":"The woman at the register was rude. There is no sign indicating they charge a $1 to use a card. I wasn't notified of that until I asked why the charge was more than my order. Their sign also says they take American Express...they don't. I got a salad, so it's tough to mess that up. It tasted fine, nothing spectacular, but they did a design with the meat and cheese. I guess that gets them one of the stars."}
{"text":"Delivery: 45 minutes late, no call.  Food: Cold, poor quality.   Bacon cheeseburger : bland, bacon undercooked. A dollar extra for 6 small onion rings, also cold. It came with a pickle wrapped in a plastic bag that somehow managed to be warmer than the burger and onion rings. Impressive.   Cheese quesadilla: Lukewarm, tiny, lacking in cheese.   Garlic knots: doughy bread lumps covered in oil. Distinct lack of garlic or seasoning of any kind.   Can of soda: Kind of warm, but still the best thing I got from this place.   Seriously, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"So ordered using Eat24. Ordered a pizza, a sandwich and fries and garlic cheese bread. They forgot the pizza!!!!! So I call them the cashier was super friendly and apologized. Said she would have a fresh pizza made and redelivered. 50 minutes (based on the time I called them) the pizza showed up and it was ice cold! Probably the  same pizza they didn't deliver the first time and left in the drivers car or something.  So it's now 1030 and the meal we ordered at 830 is officially ruined. So disappointed this place used to be soooo good. *update*** can't even get my money back because the manager has to approve it and there isn't one there until tomorrow.  Eat24 said they will follow up but that also means I have to follow up. So not only did we not get to eat our complete meal we also get to waste even more time making sure we get our money back. If this how this place is choosing to do business probably won't ever give them another try."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from here. And we'll i ordered a blackened chicken Caesar salad, when I received it, they gave me all ranch dressings. Totally ruined the salad for me and I ended up not eating it. I ate some of the chicken off it though, and the chicken was pretty good. Was really disappointed about the dressing though. The onion rings were okay. Maybe if I went in they would have better service. But don't really know."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!! They took care of us for a company party and everything was perfect! Plethora of options for specialty pizzas, wings and fries & salads."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fettuccine and it was very, very bland. The sauce did not have any flavor to it at all. I called the restaurant to not complain, but rather to give them a heads up in case they overlooked that step and can remedy it before serving it like that to other patrons. Well, the person that took my call said I just had to add salt to it or request flavor the next time I order! I'm not one of those people that adds extra salt to food. My taste buds usually appreciate the flavor that already exists to the recipe. This place seems very inexperienced with the restaurant business. I will not be ordering from here again. Zero flavor and zero regards to customer service."}
{"text":"Just got my order. Im dissapointed to report that they did not pay attention to the notes!? I did NOT get paper pkates, ketchup or ranch. I understand not giving me one of them but all of it?!? Thats just bad service. I tipped up front too, a mistake i wont make again. Come cafe verdi your better than this!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1-star I would ! Order food from them tonight , terrible experience! Not only did we order over 50 dollars worth , when our food came it was burnt, cold and no condiments. Called the restaurant and spoke to a manager , manager said she would send drive back out , waited an hour for SAUCES , after waiting an hour for food , when I finally call to see why its taking so long for the driver to get here; Rachel the manager on duty claims driver knocked and no one answered  but I was sitting right by my door , just like previously when the food finally came , when I asked why didn't the driver call ; Rachel the manager on duty said he called me at the store and said you didn't answer , umm excuse me ?!?? Then when asked for a refund atleast on my Burnt food , I was told no , there is nothing we can do ,Rachel acted like she didnt even care or it wasn't a big deal that we haven't eaten yet and my sandwich was burnt and I just spent over 50 dollars and had no condiments to go with our food ! Beware , menu might look great , but horrible service ! Never ordering from them again !"}
{"text":"We had the Boyd sandwich and a philly large. Both we very good. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Wow, honestly impressed with this food. Ordered delivery, poppers and a Margherita pizza. Delivery arrived before the estimated time, food was hot, fresh and (this is weird, but) really good ranch and marinara  lol. Everything was on point. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I was SOOOOOOO SURPRISED at the service.  Delicious food and fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me I ordered this burger medium, no tomato. What I got was no onion, no cheese and 1/2 of a piece of bacon? So i called to tell them...and the guy on the phone argued with me? Telling I specifically put together that burger. Fine I am about to take a pic of this burger and post it all over social media!"}
