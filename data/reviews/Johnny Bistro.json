{"text":"A real gem of a restaurant. Their grilled anti pasta platter was really yummy and it filled me up! I couldn't finish my main  the Elena borsetti and had to pack it to go. My husband polished off his steak. We both enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful decor, everything just \"works\". Staff friendly and attentive.  The food... had the pie and have to say it is quite rare to have it STILL PIPING HOT all the way to the end. Will certainly be coming back and the prices charged are certainly fair. Not cheap but great value for what it is."}
{"text":"A normal Canadian food restaurant. The decor is old school but had a rather cozy feel. You will see the open kitchen and you'll soon find the restaurant filled with the the oily fume. Perhaps the ventilation needs a little bit of work and your clothes might catch the smell afterward. The staffs are friendly and you can feel that the place is family run since it gives off that vibe. The menu items has names attached to the item. It seemed like its a tribute to the family member who developed the fish.   The food wasn't too memorable though. I had a salmon and my girlfriend had a linguini. Nothing special and I found my salmon tasteless and a dry. The salad was alright. Mine came with \"grilled vegetable\" which was essentially a few vegetable items on a stick overlooked and shrunken to a pitiful state. You feel sad looking at the miserable thing. The dining experience was flat throughout the whole meal. The price seems reasonable. Your typical price range at a restaurant like this. Perhaps this is a place I would choose if I had a choice between the big chain restaurants and this."}
{"text":"This a great little Italian place with an impressive and tasty menu! The sandwiches are my fave, served on grilled focaccia with roasted peppers, pesto spread and one of my all time favourite spinach salads. You can actually buy the house dressing by the bottle which is well worth it, it's a really unique and flavourful vinaigrette. There are of course other kinds of paninis, build your own pasta, good starters, seafood, and all the other good Italian staples. The service is always great and the only thing slightly lacking is the dessert menu.  Some of my favourite things about Johnny Bistro aren't even the food. There is fabulous art on the walls that you can buy! Sounds a little weird, but the pieces are so cool, and not too outrageous if you're in the art market. Generally they range from $250-$500.  Great patio in the summer time for drinking caesars and their delicious strawberry daiquiris!"}
{"text":"We don't go here as often as we should, the food is great and it is a good value. We were there last week and really enjoyed it. We had the calamari appetizer which was fresh, I had Elena's Borsetti filled with feta and baby spinach in a basil pesto with zucchini and cherry tomatoes and loved it. The place has character and you can feel the passion and personal touch they put into the food. My only complaint is that it isn't opened late (closes at 9:30pm)"}
{"text":"This is a great little Italian restaurant hidden on a side street in Markham Village.  The food is consistently good, it's usually quite busy, and the prices are pretty reliable.  In the summer, the patio is great."}
{"text":"Hadn't had the opportunity to come here for a while, but glad we got the chance to.  We brought a friend along and she absolutely loved the chicken souvlaki and those amazing potatoes.  My steak, as always, was cooked perfectly medium rare and was unbelievably tender.  Really glad this place is in the neighbourhood.  It excels in every category while the other restaurants in the area are either way overpriced, have average food, or have rude staff."}
{"text":"Everything is very well done and when I went there I was greeted by a nice waitress. The prices are very good for what you get and I would say the food is pretty good as well. The place feels very cozy and the decorations adds to that feeling. The reason this place didn't get five stars is because they lack something really special. But other than that everything is solid."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed my Garden Burger!!  It arrived open-faced and the grilled zucchini, roasted red pepper, goat cheese, basil pesto, and arugula with a vegetarian house made black bean patty on two fluffy buns.  The burger arrived with one included side (from the choices of lemon roast potatoes, bistro rice, fresh cut fries, sweet potato fries, Bistro house salad, Caesar salad, or Greek salad) -- I chose the Bistro house salad.  I was thoroughly and highly impressed with this veggie burger!  Actually, I think this was the first and only time I had ever ordered a vegetarian burger at a restaurant.  I was so proud of myself for sticking to this choice (I was actually quite intrigued with their popular Chicken Souvlaki dish and almost ordered that based on the server's recommendations) but so glad that I stuck with my first choice.  If you like vegetarian burgers or want to try one, I highly recommend this one from Johnny Bistro's!  I loved how the vegetarian house made black bean patty was slightly seasoned and the black bean patty held together well.  The grilled zucchini and roasted red pepper were extremely juicy and fresh.  I had a great time biting into this burger."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Always go with my parents when they come to visit. Nothing particularly special about this place and I find some prices fine, while others on the expensive side (their salads are very expensive and they don't include a protein which is a considerable amount more, for example), and I find their tables are very low (weird, but annoying when trying to eat some things...like my soup), but the food has been consistently good, as has the service and the atmosphere nice. Wish they had more in terms of a kids menu, but we'll be back."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and was always intrigued by this area given the number of restaurants in the area that are locally owned and operated. I didn't know the area so I went to tripadvisor to try and find some good reviews of places I might want to try. The review right beside me in the window says \"Best Markham Bistro\" talking about great food and great service so I was excited. Tuesday date night at this restaurant.   Well...I can't say I was lucky enough to have the same experience. In short, the food was terribly mediocre at best, and the atmosphere was a little dated, and meh. Not much traffic for a Tuesday night, which I can't hold completely against the restaurant. The exterior did look really good though.  Ordered a Seafood Medley as an app. It was $15. It literally was the following, 5 small calamari rings, 3 mini squids, 3 medium sized shrimp pieces, 4 bay scallops a handful of field greens and a terribly sweet dressing which were all \"cooked\" on a flattop apparently. Nothing special, and definitely not worth the $15 asking price.  Had a Steak Jonathan which according to the menu was a 10oz strip steak apparently seasoned and finished with a \"splash of red wine.\" This was supposed to come with a \"Roast vegetable kebob\" and delicately roasted potatoes. What I got was actually, a decent cut of steak, fatty, bleh seasoning, no wine sauce. A single kebob with tiny single pieces of the following \"vegetables\": cherry tomato, half a white mushroom, a slice of red bell pepper, a thin slice of red onion. The \"roasted potato\" was literally a whole white potato that was baked in the oven then sliced into 8 pieces. That whole meal was $22. Both too good to be true and way too much for what it was.  Silver lining is that my Wife had a peppercorn burger and sweet potato fries. Not actually that bad. The sweet potato fries tasted great, specifically like McDonalds Chicken Nuggets which is probably what the fries were fried in.   Summary: Went in there looking for the place the positive reviews talked about, left paying way too much for food that was just mediocre at its very best."}
{"text":"It was a busy night at the Bistro when I arrived to join some friends, fourteen of us. We had a reservation for 8:00pm but didn't get seated until closer to 8:45pm. My friends, however, were already having drinks and chatting, not minding the wait. They had ordered some appetizers, which arrived soon after we were seated.  It took a little while for our meals to arrive once we ordered. Again, we didn't mind too much because we were chatting and we could see how busy they were in the kitchen.  We started with calamari, saganaki, and an antipasto platter. Our mains included fish & chips, chicken souvlaki, BBQ ribs, beet salad, lobster ravioli, peppercorn burger, steak sandwich, and more. The portions were very generous and the presentation was nice. It looks like everybody enjoyed their food.  I chose a 10oz steak with roasted potatoes and a Caesar salad. While it was good, I would have preferred a hotter sear on the steak. I did have a small issue with the Caesar salad though. It really wasn't a Caesar salad. It was iceberg lettuce in a creamy sauce that was more like ranch. Not what I was expecting.  Overall, it was a nice evening out with friends. I'm sure most of them will be back since they live nearby."}
{"text":"Portions are huge!  Great to share with friends and their patio is nice!  Their food is authentic Italian style, got some hearty panini going on and some brunch choices. They all looked fantastic!  Service is good. Some dishes are better than others I must say, taste is decent, would give 3.5 stars.   Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long this place has been open but I can't believe this is so close to home and I am only now visiting. Came here on a Friday during lunch and there were a good number of customers already there. Beautiful setup inside with an open kitchen so that you can see the one man chef at work. There is also a nice patio area outside.   The service is excellent and very friendly. Our waitress came by to ask how we were doing and she could see that our mouths were fully of food so she just said \"gimme a thumbs up if you're okay\". Near the end of our meal we told the waitress that we were running late so we needed the bill before we even finished. She once again busted out that great friendly humor by saying, \"you sure I can't twist your arm and get you a cup of coffee or something?\". If I wasn't in a rush I would have stayed for sure.  The food is just as great as the service.  Lunch special #1 $13.95 - steak sandwich with cheese and BBQ sauce along with a small salad and a soup. The steak was huge and was hanging over the bread. The meat was also soft and tender so I didn't have to tear at it like a wild beast. Salad was fresh and tasty and loved the grilled mushrooms that came with the salad. The soup was tomato/veggie based and tasted great. Served in a large mug with crackers. All this for $13.95 is a great deal in my books.   Large Mediterranean salad $10 - fresh veggies with grilled red peppers, drizzled with honey and topped with huge chucks of goat cheese. I loved everything about the salad even though I am not big on salads."}
{"text":"After reading the many positive reviews we decided to give this place a try. Went in without a reservation at about 7pm on a Friday night. The interior portion of the restaurant was empty save for two tables of two people. We ask if we may have a seat on the patio - the waitress says without a reservation that may be tough but she will try to get us in.   10 seconds later we are asked to follow her to the patio area which is empty save for one table with two patrons. Maybe every table was reserved for later (we initially thought) but at the end of what was a lengthy dining experience we realized it wasn't the case.   I ordered a steak sandwich and fries and my partner the chicken breast club with salad. Asking to have half salad and half sweet potato fries is a big no as we are told 'it just can't be done'. Haha ok.   And then the waiting began.   40 minutes worth.   At this point there were a few other tables now occupied and each and every time a waitress came out with trays we had the hopeful look that it was indeed our turn. But no.   Not once did the waitress come over to acknowledge the wait. We were about to pay for our cokes and leave when another waitress came with our food. Ironically after we are served THEN does our original waitress decide to be attentive and ask how things are.   The food - steak sandwich was tough and meat full of gristle. Fries were ok; lots of remnant pieces.   Chicken club was ok. Chicken needed some seasoning.   I was expecting better having waited forty minutes for these sandwiches.    We will not return."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?????  I used to come here a lot when I worked and had a large friend base in Markham, about 5-10 years ago. We would come for weekend dinners and special events like someones birthday. I even brought by picky parents here numerous times and they loved it!  Came back recently after a few years for my birthday dinner all the way from the city as I was craving some comfort food. What a letdown it turned out to be!  Service was terrible. I felt as though we were invisible. Ignored most of the night and when we were actually served I found our servers attitude to be very nonchalant, even a bit rude.  I'm not sure if the ventilation wasn't working properly, but the restaurant was really really smoky inside, and smelled terribly of fumes and had a burnt smell. It was too the point that my eyes stared to sting and I just wanted to get out of there. It was also excessively hot - this is coming from someone who is always freezing even when the heat is blasting. I was dripping sweat and smelling burnt fumes with stinging eyes and the whole meal was just physically uncomfortable.   Now the food.....definitely not what it used to be. I always order the alfredo sauce pasta, and always LOVED their sauce. They were the only place, in my books, that could make a real proper alfredo sauce, that didnt taste like bland gloopy paste.They used to make it perfectly! This time around the pasta was so dry and the sauce has definitely lost its luster. Not much flavour and not what it used to be. Plus the really skimped on the sauce and the food came out lukewarm. Yuck.  My boyfriend got some fish that was equally cold and dry with minimal sides....they seem to be rationing everything here...  Anyways, terrible meal and even more terrible since I know how good they used to be. Only giving them 2 instead of 1 star for nostalgia's sake. Won't be back to give them another shot cus they have just sunk to deep."}
{"text":"Johnny Bistro is a good neighbourhood restaurant.   It is kind of located off the main streets... so it is not a place that you would have drive by and say let's go there. When I suggested to have dinner at Johnny, my boyfriend who lives in the area for over 15 years, never even know this place exist!  Aside from the main menu, there are also daily lunch/dinner special menu.  Open kitchen so you can watch your food being prepared.   Caesar Salad ($5) - fresh and crispy romaine a little heavy on the dressing  Little Lorenza ($15) - Breaded Veal with Smoked Mozzarella Cheese and Linguine with Tomato Sauce - Breaded Veal a little on the dry side but huge portion for the price - Linguine was cooked al dente  Peppercorn Roast Beef Panini with Pasta Vinaigrette Salad ($10) - Huge portion for the price - the sandwich just on the dry side  Johnny Bistro feels like a little neighbourhood pub. A lot of locals enjoy their meals here. You get huge portions but these are no gourmet food. Reminds me of more down to earth home cooking?!  Italian mama trying to feed me all these food..........until I burst!"}
{"text":"beautiful patio and decent food. I've been there a couple times and tried a few different dishes. The seafood platter was ok, the beef barley soup was too salty but the lobster ravioli was great. It's worth a visit just to sit on the beautiful patio."}
