{"text":"Good food, great service. Husband and I ordered the chicken with mac and cheese and the gyro gnocchi dish. They were both very good. I thought the mac and cheese could have been creamier and needed a little salt, but husband thought I was crazy. Also thought the lamb in the gnocchi dish was a little dry... husband also thought I was crazy about this. We polished off our gluttony with the deep fried brownie. It was good, but I wish we had gotten then brie ice cream with apple fritters. Wine and beer selection was good. We don't get to eat out often and I'm glad we chose this place!"}
{"text":"Saw this place nominated in the Cleveland Scene magazine and decided to give it a try. Drinks, Food, Service were all AWESOME! We ordered the Verve Fries and the Rueben Ribs. Both were incredible, the ribs somehow tasted identical to a Rueben made with corned beef! For Dinner we all ordered something different, the pork paprikash was so good I contemplated ordering a 2nd plate! 

We also had a diner with us who was Vegan, and when we notified the server it seemed as if the Chef accepted the challenge and made something completely off the menu!

All in all a great experience and I have been telling everyone to check it out. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointing date night.  We are going to be moving near by and wanted to check out, what will soon be, our local fare.   We were really hoping to find a gem, but I thought the food was mediocre at best.  My one positive was that I thought the service was great.  

To start, they brought out pumpernickel bread that was VERY stale.  Since my husband isn't a fan of that type of bread, we asked if they happen to have any white/Italian bread options.  They brought baguette slices, which again, were extremely stale - to the point where we took a bite and left the remaining piece on our plate.  

We started with drinks.  I had their specialty mule, which was served in a mason jar instead of a copper mug.  My husband had a glass of wine and was happy with their option.   We ordered the mussel appetizer, which had a great flavor, but they said it came with ramen noodles... it tasted and looked like the squiggly noodles from the 50 cent packets and there were only a few of them.  We had the \"raw\" salad.  Which was good, but they charged $9 for a typical salad with a few shaved veggies in it.  I had the pulled pork paprikash with the paprika spatzl and it was literally a brick of meat with some sauce around it with very few small crunchy noodles.  It wasn't a balanced dish at all - it was almost all meat.  My husband had the short ribs and said it was just ok and thought mine was better.  At this point we passed on the dessert and was served two small stale chocolate chip cookies with our bill.  

With two drinks, a shared appetizer and salad, and two entrees, we spent almost $115.  For that price, I have had much better food elsewhere.  I don't think we will be returning here, which is a bummer.  We were excited to try this one."}
{"text":"Every bite of our meal was perfect .  The Board with bone marrow, pork belly was perfection.  We ordered duck and steak both Cook spot on . We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Been here several times and everything I try is my new favorite. Love them scallops, skirt steak, omelet, bangers. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We had the wings & meatballs (a little cold) as an appetizer which both tasted great.  I ordered the flat iron steak medium well and the server told me I should order it medium or medium rare or it wouldn't taste right & would be tough.  I told her I was pregnant and needed it to be cooked more.  I seriously felt she should have just left it at that instead of debating how my meat should be cooked but she kept going on about it.  My baby's safety is most important.  After all that the steak wasn't tough & tasted great.   I probably won't go back if I'm going to be berated for how I want my steak cooked.  Overall the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Been hear a handful of times since it's been opened. Absolutely love cork and cleaver. Confit chicken wings and Ruben ribs are amazing. I've ordered entrees of the regular menu being the gnocchi and fried chicken Mac and cheese. They are both great. I usually do always get their daily special which has always been outstanding. It's nice having a gourmet, artsy type of restaurant right in the suburbs, instead of heading down to ohio city, tremont or downtown. Oh and can't go wrong with their hand made cocktails."}
{"text":"I ordered flat iron steak which I give 3 stars, my friend ordered lamp with cucumber which is very tasty."}
{"text":"The food was good; portions very small. I had a salad that should have been listed as a \"side\" item and way overpriced at $9.00... Nothing special about the salad and not worth more than $5; my husband had the pork paprikash and liked it but definitely left hungry due to small portion...the pork came with no sides."}
{"text":"Not my best experience food not worth the price and service was slow. And heard that they are leasing reddstone and turning it into graffiti social kitchen???really they took over Cleveland's hidden gem and doing away with comedy there now that's a joke reddstone was on of the best bars and restaurants very disappointed and definitely not good thing for battery park"}
{"text":"Great foodie place in Broadview Heights. Who would have thought such great restaurants existed outside Cleveland?

Drinks were great. Tried the Stellar which is a foamy peach vodka drink. Delicious--couldn't even taste the vodka. Also tried another drink which was just whiskey and ginger beer, which was made perfectly.

Everyone is served pumpernickel bread with spinach dip--a nice change from usually getting bread and butter.

We started off with chicken and waffles and the Reuben ribs. The chicken and waffles is served with a spicy butter. The syrup compliments this very well. The Reuben ribs were awesome and would definitely recommend.

Split the pork paprikash as our entree. Very delicious.

Had a deep fried brownie for dessert. Interesting taste. I wish they had a better dessert selection.

Our server was great.

The decor is pretty bad but I wasn't expecting anything super trendy.

Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"There are lots of restaurants in Cleveland that try to do upscale, farm-to-table, American-fusion cuisine but fall short of the mark. C&C is not one of them. Each thing on the menu is a carefully balanced composition of non-intuitive flavor combinations, and they are all executed to perfection. The meats are tender. The sauces are to taste. The vegetables are fresh and crunchy. The combination is amazing. Also, great service and ambience. Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! The scallop app and hanger steak were my favorites. The waiters are also were knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Wow. The food was absolutely amazing! I had the beet salad and the trout - both were decent sized portions and delicious!  Don't be deceived by the unassuming strip mall facade - this place is the real deal. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"After looking at the website, and hearing great reviews from friends about Cork and Cleaver, I was super excited to try it.

I love the farm to table idea. It's very popular in bigger cities, and I'm glad to see it coming to Ohio finally. 

If you are just getting into finer food, this is a great place. I just think they need a little more time to get even more creative. There wasn't anything wrong with the food, it was prepared well. It just lacked... something. Their cocktails were very well balanced, which I appreciated. And the wine selection was good."}
{"text":"I made an earlier Friday night trip to test the waters. Sat at the small bar, the Bartender was fast and personable. I ordered a scallop appetizer that came out pretty fast and was very good. I didn't have time to try any more that night, but will for sure be back to dig deeper into the menu.

Don't let the location in a sleepy strip mall in Broadview fool you, it's worth a trip. It's not very big, but was full and on a wait by 6:30 on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighborhood and had been wanting to try  the establishment for some time.  However I had my hesitation since we had a toddler with us.  The staff was quite accommodating. Service was great.  Food was fast and fresh.  Had wings and wife had beet salad , then short rib  special and walleye.  All were spectacular.  Not a food snob but I might turn in to one eating here often!  Lol.

{"text":"Keeping it short. This place is fantastic and I can't wait to get back. Definitely has my support and highest recommendations for local  foodie connoisseurs. When you leave you will be thinking to yourself what you will want to try next time on the menu to see if you could actually top what you just ate. My only wish is that this place was a little closer to my house!"}
{"text":"A social flop.

My wife and I started with a couple cocktails that  where quite good. However when it came to the food I was not as impressed. We started with the Verve fries. I was expecting a putene type gravy with sausage what we got was not very apealing visually or in flavor. Kind of looked like dog food on french fries. For our main dishes we ordered the pork paprikash and gnocchi. The paprikash was a salty brick of shredded pork with a sauce slightly resembling paprikash. The lamb gnocchi was the better of the two dishes but not by much. Maybe some of the other dishes are as good as some of the other reviews say but our experience left something to be disired."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and honestly may give it one more try because I think our problem was more about a very bad waitress than the food itself.  My wife and I were in on Saturday.  I ordered the special Lobster Tail and my wife had the Pork Paprikash.  Both were luke warm at best.  I know we should say something and send it back but I really hate doing that.  I think there is potential here, just not the best service.

Drinks were average, waitress had no idea what I meant when I ordered my Martini \"wet\"."}
{"text":"First let me say I loved this place. The menu is simple but creative and the food is fantastic. The staff is extremely friendly. High end cuisine without high end pricing. I encourage you you to go before they realize they are priced too low ."}
{"text":"Creative cuisine. Not your standard chain food fare. Fun place hidden in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with good friends.had The Board,scallops and ruben ribs to start. 3 had the ribeye special and I had the silver snapper.for dessert we shared the lemon bruelle with pepper biscotti and the Apple pierogies.andmaple baon bread pudding. With a bottle of Laurello cabernet. Franc the night couldn't have been better. This place is phenomenal in all their twists on food. Great place for a special occasion or just an evening with apps and cocktails. Susan O'D"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and nice to have a \"tremont  -like\" restaurant in the 'burbs. I had the fried chicken and Mac and cheese - probably not the healthiest but amazing flavor and taste! My hubby had the salmon special and loved it as well. Both the appetizer and the desserts were amazing. fried brownie - need I say more?? and the root beer malt - delish!!!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything that we ordered was really, really delicious! Reuben ribs has Great flavor and melts in my mouth!!! The duck was my entrée and it really Surprised me! Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us recently came here for dinner and we weren't all that impressed. This is my second time and I was hoping they improved some but not a whole lot. The Verve Fries and Meatballs weren't that great. Sort of bland. I got the duck and it was horrible. It was too fatty in my honest opinion. I tried the Hanger Steak and it was tasty. The country fried brownie was fantastic. The best item on the menu."}
{"text":"3rd time no complaints, only accolades. The menu has some of the great standbys you come here for but their farm to table approach promises new creative dishes based on seasonal options and offerings. 
We won the lotto on servers last night. Sharlie just plain rocks! It's one thing to be good and attentive but knowledge, charm and the ability to help your guest have a memorable meal outside of the food is just natural and comes from pure care and talent. Service like Sharlie delivers is greatly appreciated by someone who eats out as often as I do. It's easy to tire of the same hum drum 'have you decided yet' server is whose greatest concern is selling today's special and increasing the average ticket cost to increase their tip. Sharlie knew her stuff...and was fun and engaging too. 
I'll return for the food, but I'll insist on Sharlie."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken and waffles and Reuben ribs as appetizers.  Ribs were ok but for me the Reuben twist was too much.  If I you want a Reuben then go get a Reuben.  I didn't see how the combo made ribs better or made the Reuben flavor better.  The waffles were dry. I don't think they were made from batter, but probably warmed over.  The chicken was more of a patty like a chicken crab cake.  My entre was the pork paprikash, which like the chicken was a grind with spices but this time shaped like a meatloaf.  The flavor of the loaf was inconsistent, like the ingredients weren't adequately mixed.  The meat was dry and the dish came with very little paprikash broth.  The dish came with very little speatzl, probably less that 15 noodles.  I tried other entres like the Greek noodle dish, which was similar to the Reuben ribs in that it mixed two dishes together in a way that did not result in an improvement.  This probably just isn't my type of restaurant.  It's apparent that others really like it, so I would say if the menu looks interesting to you then go for it.  But if your planning on ordering the pork paprikash then bring your own speatzl."}
{"text":"Back at Cork and Cleaver for the third time to try something new! I've tried a few appetizers and they've all been amazing.  The pork paprikash wasn't what I expected but I liked and so did my dad. I LOVED the pork chop with the brussel sprouts but they have some new menu items and that one's not available right now. Cocktails are well made and the service is awesome.  Trying the chicken wings tonight since everyone is raving about them!"}
{"text":"Interesting location being in a strip mall, but food was good.  The Beet Salad was my favorite part of the meal!   Good beer and wine selection.  A little pricey for the quantity."}
{"text":"Food is excellent every time. I love how the menu is small, but everything on it is really good. The staff if very knowledgeable. All around this is one of our favorite spots for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Been their twice and had a great meal each time. I love how friendly everyone is. Loved the stories the wait staff told about how they've all worked together for a long time. There's always an early crowd, but it's usually find a table later."}
{"text":"App and entree were good (scallops / bangers).  Desert and salad were amazing! (Panna cotta / beet).   Odd location but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"What a treasure for those of us south of Cleveland!  Ate there last night for the second time and can say nothing but great things about the food and staff. We had reservations both times and were seated immediately. Ordered cocktails and wine quickly and our server gave us the specials which all sounded good. We started with the verve fries which were a pile of salty fried yumminess. First time out I had the pork paprikash and DH had the chorizo omelette. Second time I tried the gnocchi and DH stuck with the omelette. The meat was cooked to perfection each time and everything was wonderful. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great local and organic food and attention to detail. Must try the Mason Mule homemade drink!  You will be shocked by how good it all is...and in Broadview Hts!"}
{"text":"Cork and Clever is one of our favorite places. We've eaten dinner here at least 6 times and the food and experience is always wonderful. We always try something new and had never had a bad dish. All the food has an amazing flavor and is prepared in a unique way from other restaurants. 

Cork and Clever is in a league of their own...definitely a must try for everyone....and it's affordable....no braking the bank here. Amazing food at a good value and the owner will make a round to every table to make sure everything is on par. Staff and owners are friendly and remember their customers."}
{"text":"Every restaurant I go to has now been ruined by this place. It sets the bar for food and no one has come close to touching it. If I were on death row, I would ask for a meal from Cork and Cleaver. Hits the mark in every way: amazing inventive cocktails, friendly attentive wait staff who really know the menu, and food that leaves you savoring every bite.

 My favorites: 
appetizer: chicken wings. hands down best wings i've ever had. the meat falls off the bone
entree: gnocchi with lamb

Although keep in mind their menu changes with the seasons, so you might be disappointed to go back and find your old favorite has been changed to something different to keep it seasonable, but I am not in anyway holding that against them. If anything its a reason to go back and see whats new on the menu. I am moving out of the Cleveland area and could cry that I won't be able to go to cork and cleaver any more."}
{"text":"Very good food. Off the beaten path. Meat is tender. Fries are awesome. Service was the greatest. Beverages unusual. Not your usual fare. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I agree with Bob L's assessment of the overall confusing vibe of the place, but I suppose that could be a good thing.  My husband made me promise to praise their music selection, which is something I rarely notice.

Our waiter was very friendly and informative, if a bit too chatty.  I really liked that he emphasized that a lot of the vegetables were grown at a farm just down the street.  I stepped outside my comfort zone a bit and tried the deconstructed gyro gnocchi dish.  The flavors and textures were all good, and the portion was enormous.  There was seriously an over abundance of lamb; they easily could have given me half and I wouldn't have given it a second though.  Could have used more of the cucumber/radish topping though.  My husband greatly enjoyed his chicken and mac and cheese dish.  I have never seen such a large portion of mac and cheese anywhere - more than double what you would expect with an entree.  I thought it was a little disappointing that there were few vegetarian dishes and no vegan dishes on the menu.  But my sister, who is the vegan, was very pleased when the waiter said that they'd adapt anything on the menu or the chef could whip up something unlisted if she wanted.  I was super impressed when the bill came and they actually charged her a buck less than the listed price for both her fries without gravy and mushroom salad without egg.  I've never seen anyone do that before.  She said the fries were pretty good, but the mushroom salad was not.  Perhaps it really needed the egg.  Overall I think the most delicious part of the meal was the spinach  butter that came with the (slightly stale) complimentary bread.

I didn't really look at the drink or dessert options,  but I did admire the penny-topped bar."}
{"text":"A party of 4, we all had different entrees and all were wonderful Service was great Prices low for the quality Will be back"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving, especially if you're a nice restaurant in a plaza near a convenient store. 

I went with a group of girl friends and of course started out with drinks (there is no happy hour). A few of us ordered wine and a few of us ordered mixed drinks. The 2 favored mixed drinks were the Mason's Mule and Whiskey Sour.

I was at Best of Cleveland event about 2 years ago and had a sample of their Gnocchi which is best described as a deconstructed gyro. It took me that long to check this place out and I wish I hadn't waited so long. As a whole, our group ordered Pork Paprikash, Gnocchi, Verve Fries, Chicken Wings and the Chicken and Waffles. I know a lot of reviews on here state how much people love the fries but I just was not impressed by them.  I did however fall in love with the Chicken Wings. The honey sauce that the wings sit on top of is delectable and the wings are perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"Good things come in small packages and surprises lurk in unlikely strip malls. The Cork and Cleaver is one of the best new restaurants I've come across in several years. Yes, Cleveland has its Iron Chefs. Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington has James Beard winners. We've dined with them. Broadview Heights has 30 year old Adam, owner-chef, of a very exciting dining concept that is and will be the equal of any in the area. The wine list was carefully picked and nicely priced, a refreshing change from the 2 and 3 times markups often seen. From appetizers such as the Reuben rib and fried tomatillo, to a very sophisticated wild mushroom salad to the entrees, gnocchi with braised lamb for Joanne and the pork paprikash for me, the surprises kept coming. I asked to meet Adam and our server, Nicole, graciously made him appear so that I could thank him personally for the marvelous culinary experience. He was most grateful; his best days are certainly ahead of him. Oh, for dessert, we had to sample the malted milk ice cream with crunchy root beer meringue ... on my! We will return soon and hope that Adam will remember us amid the crowds sure to appear. Five Stars."}
{"text":"We pieced together a meal of appetizers and I have to say, I was not impressed given the price. I do think it can be unfair to judge a place without getting entrees so take this for what it is worth. We had the board, scallops, fries, wings, and pickles. The board was the best value for what you get, but I've had much better versions of each element elsewhere. The real disappointments were the other apps which were way expensive for what you get. I think the wings come out to like $2 each. Scallops more like $3.50 each and were tiny. I don't mind paying a premium for exceptionalism but this was not it."}
{"text":"You need to hit this place. Yeah, its location sucks.  Ex-urban strip mall facing an uninspired Broadview road. But the food and service are fabulous. Never a bad experience in five visits. I always get 'the board' with a manhattan. You might not swing that way, but my god, the umami of the marrow and foi gras and the makers mark make for an appetizer of mystic savory proportion. I'm sitting here waiting on the red drum fish special. I'm just that confident it will be spectacular that I'm posting NOW and not waiting. So get in here and support this little gem. Yeah YOU, NOW! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been meaning to give this place a try, and this past weekend we finally got our chance!  We met-up with friends and shared a terrific meal together.  Our server was very knowledgeable and accommodating, helping us select cocktails and then being very patient and helpful when picking out a wine to compliment my wife's dinner choice.

The meal started out with a basket of small-sized pumpernickel bread slices served with an unusual spinach and herbed butter spread.  It was a great combination, tasting like the dip you'd get in a pumpernickel bread bowl appetizer.

My wife and I shared the Brussel sprouts appetizer and it was truly the best dish of the entire meal with its pungent smoked blue cheese chunks and bacon bits.  I would order that every time I come here.  Our dining companions ordered the C&C fried pickles (which we also tried); they were unusual in that the pickles were sweet, but accompanied by a dill aioli made for a great  and unexpected combo.

For an entree, I ordered the pork paprikash was a unique twist on a classic comfort food dish; the spaetzle were so tiny but mixed well with the pork shoulder \"brick\" and moat of creamy sauce (see my attached picture to understand this dish better).  It was so filling and rich that I could only eat half of it.  No mind however, as the leftovers made for a great lunch meal the next day!

At the end of the meal, our server brought a small plate filled with four baby chocolate chip cookies...a nice (sweet) way to finish the meal.

We really enjoyed our meal here.  The setting and feel of the dishes were \"big city\" with no air of pretentiousness whatsoever and a very knowledgeable and friendly staff to boot.  Nice job guys, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delish. The service was wonderful and the waiter was super nice and easy to talk with. The menu was inventive but had really accessible food. We had the pork paprikash, chicken and waffles and monkfish. All three dishes were amazing and the portion sizes were perfect. Would recommend to anyone near by! Plus they gave us homemade pumpernickel bread with really good spinach parmesan butter and then! after dinner they gave us caramel vanilla popcorn! So good."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with Cork and Cleaver. The buzz for this place is not hype (thankfully). The food coming out of the kitchen is great. I don't know that I've ever wanted to try *everything* on a restaurant's menu and that is the case for me with Cork and Cleaver. 

It was easy for me to find off of a nearby highway. Easy parking as the restaurant is in a small shopping strip.

Upon arrival, our table wasn't available yet (no big deal). We were ushered to the bar area to wait.  The owner, Brian, gave us menus so we could look at the drinks, and asked for our drink orders as well after we were busy chatting and hadn't ordered drinks yet. We both ordered Mason's Mules, which were excellent. Vanilla infused whisky, muddled orange, and ginger beer. This is a really well put together cocktail. I might try to make them at home they were so good. 

They serve warm pumpernickel bread and butter with spinach (and garlic? I can't remember) when you are seated. Such a nice departure from flavorless white breads. 

My friend and I opted to order several appetizers to split. We had the verve fries - hand-cut fries with a garlic sausage gravy. The serving size was huge (no complaints here. I promise). The fries and sausage, individually and together, were delicious.  The best sausage gravy I've ever had. 

We ordered chicken and waffles, which were nicely presented.  The perfect mixture of sweet and savory. Excellent. 

After eating the 2 appetizers, we were surprised to find ourselves being full. I guess we shouldn't have been surprised after a bunch of drinks, bread, a mountain of fries and chicken and waffles. We had planned to order more, but in the end we opted to get dessert and ordering entrees would have to wait until another day. We ordered the deep fried brownie with vanilla ice cream and pickled cherries. The brownie was crispy on the outside and melted gooey goodness on the inside. The chocolate wasn't overwhelming or too rich, thankfully.  It was a fantastic dessert.  There were 4 or 5 dessert options and all were non-traditional desserts. All desserts are made in house by the chef, according to our server.

Service was decent despite a packed house. The place is warmly decorated with dim lighting. One room filled with 4 top tables, and another room with the bar and some booths and additional a few additional 4 tops. 

I can't wait to go back. 

If you like a menu with a twist, I think you'll enjoy Cork and Cleaver."}
{"text":"All in all a mediocre meal. We ordered the gnocchi with braised lamb, pork chops and maple bacon bread pudding. The presentation was beautiful and the food was cooked well but it just lacked excitement"}
{"text":"Glad no one cares what the one or two negative folks are saying about this place. We've been three times. We've eaten at great restaurants in Ny, cle, chi, Portland, etc. This place matches the best. 

If you have a bad experience that's too bad. But it has to be the exception. People who leave reviews like that have no business having access to the internet. They need to tell us what happened to them in high school before each review. You gotta love people.

Amazing. Best fried chicken and Mac I can imagine existing in a physical world bound to the known laws of physics and chemistry. 

Had it again the next time. Same result. Can't finish it. But (high-pitched) SO good. 

We made ourselves order small plates for the third visit. Eating the wedge salad with candied tomatoes and crispy pork belly and bleu cheese schmearo dressing was fun. That pork belly did its job. And the flavors are all great. Try it. 

Reuben ribs. No idea how that is possible. They taste like corned beef. 

Confit wings. So crispy. So light. Moist and juice-filled. Yep. Will get these again. 

So Happy to have this place near home."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and knowledgable. The food was amazing!! I had the chicken and waffles appetizer, the mushroom salad, and the scallop entree. My hubby and I split the spicy fried brownie. I LOVED everything. We had a party of six and we were all trying each others dishes and arguing who had the best. We agreed to disagree because it was all delicious. I also really appreciate that they buy food from local growers. It is a great way to support the community."}
{"text":"Great food quality! Coming from someone who lived and travels to NYC on a regular basis, I can say, this place would make it in the big apple ;) we need more places like this around here!!"}
{"text":"Where to start?  The difference from the previous dining experiences at Cork and Cleaver to this last experience is so extreme it could be two different places.  When accounts are described of businesses going downhill __ this certainly would relate...Reservations and arrangements were made to celebrate a family occasion and was looking forward to entertaining here it had been so enjoyable in the past from the food to the great service from our waiter.  It was not to be!  Arrived early as wanted to ensure that guests received the menus without pricing and the check was not delivered to the table to be picked up by someone else.  These arrangements were made in advance with the reservations, as in the past, however wanted to reiterate with our Server.  The Hostess, new, young, and to give her the benefit of the doubt, inexperienced, lead me to the table and proceeded to scatter the menus with pricing.  As I gathered up the menus explained to this young woman, the arrangements and requested the menus without pricing for the rest of the guests.  She apparently was unaware of this practice because instead of, oh let us just say going to ask someone with more experience, as suggested, she preferred to argue the issue.  Was becoming increasingly uncomfortable, as my guests were about to arrive at any moment and finally had to insist on speaking with a Manager, Supervisor and/or Owner.  Actually, it was unbelievable that this exchange was going on for so long.  Watched as the Hostess walked over to another woman, who did not appear to be a Server and within moments our Server, not the Hostess, arrived with the menus without pricing?  Thanked her and reiterated how to please provide me the check at the end of the meal.  Guests arrived, the meal was fairly uneventful__ Food __ Salads/Greens were modified in size by at least half since we last dined, still delicious, Appetizers/Tasters ordered the Scallops, which were excellently prepared, believe everyone would agree to eat a tray of them, Calamari always a favorite and a couple of items unlisted on the menu one of which was seafood type crab cakes which were lacking flavor and tasted like mashed potatoes without the basic seasoning or in this case and the seafood and ingredients for that matter.  One of our Guests only drinks soft drinks and was extremely disappointed in the taste of the offering although the waitress attempted to replace the drink a couple of times she was unable to advise if the beverage was a fountain drink that wasn't calibrated correctly or from a can/bottle?  Strange?  The Main Entrees/Bigger Things, the Lamb with Gnocchi, although much smaller in portion size than remembered was still quite tasty.

Another thing that appeared to be new and unwelcome was receiving the bill without details of the charges!  Since I did not want to make a fuss in front of my guests, I resolved to contact the Management/Owners in writing for a detailed bill, as soon as I got home.  Since we had been communicating in writing, via E-Mail, to make the arrangements believed they would assist in providing a detailed bill.  In addition, since it appeared there may be an error in calculating and an overcharge, which can be an honest error and could be rectified.  However, things can only be explained and/or rectified if someone had responded.  Apparently keeping customers is not a concern of the Cork and Cleaver Management.  Good Luck to them will not be returning nor recommending."}
{"text":"Cork & Cleaver Social Kitchen in Broadview Heights: an inventive, gourmet restaurant serving modern twists on classic favs. We enjoyed a seat at the bar, where Ronny, the mixologist behind the bar, served up some of the most delish artisan cocktails we've tasted south of Tremont. Along with his arsenal of delectable seasonal creations, he served the BEST pumpkin martini we've ever tasted- hands down! If you're feeling adventurous, invite him to stir up something spontaneous for you. As French fry fanatics, we began with the verve fries- hand cut and smothered in garlic sausage gravy. These were so good that we contemplated licking the plate. Lightening up our overindulgent app, we chose the beet salad with goat cheese, walnuts and citrus vinaigrette. Bright, light and creamy- it was the perfect successor to the fries. Our entrees, pork paprikash and gyro-inspired gnocci with lamb and cuc sauce, were both knock-your-socks-off ahhhh-mazing. After careful consideration, the gnocchi reigned as especially mind-blowing! We also had the pleasure of being greeted by chef and part owner, Brian Okin, who was welcoming and appreciative of our patronage and rave review. Cork & Cleaver Social Kitchen is the most impressive restaurant addition to the south side in years."}

I ordered the gin drink which was okay. Had the chicken and waffles which were.. dry and flaky and not delicious. The chicken was in the form of a breaded patty. The waffles were cold and hard. Didn't make for a good combination. My husband had the pasta noodles with veggies which he thought were okay. 
The ambience was fresh and clean. We went on a Tuesday night. The waiter was very helpful and cordial. IDK if I would go back though."}
{"text":"Always fantastic. Service is fast, your glass is always full and the staff is very friendly. We haven't had anything that was not delicious here. Very fair pricing for the quality. Definitely a hidden gem. It's also awesome that the atmosphere is casual, even though it's high quality it doesn't feel stiff or stuck up. Great place for anything from a date night to a get together with friends."}
{"text":"Adjusting my rating downward for the somewhat d-baggy guy who picked up the phone while I just tried to call in a reservation just now.  Congrats on being so popular that you can be snarky on the phone."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the strip mall location.  Don't be put off by the fact it is in the burbs. Get in the car and go, because this is a great restaurant! We drove 25 minutes outside of the city while there on vacation and it was worth every minute.  

The meal started off with a really interesting and delicious take on chicken and waffles - the chicken was represented by breaded squarish chicken croquettes filled with tender, flavorful pieces of juicy chicken, and the herbed waffles weren't overpowering, while the spicy butter added a depth of flavor and a bit of a kick. Paired with our custom cocktails, it was a great start. 

That was followed by a Caesar salad, which actually used the same chicken croquettes basically as croutons.  The greens were perfectly dressed. 

For a main course, I had swordfish served over a garlic sausage cassoulet - an interesting combination that worked well, though the swordfish was so perfectly cooked and season, I would have been happy with a just a plate of the fish. 

My wife enjoyed a crispy shrimp risotto with a spicy soy drizzle.  The risotto was perfectly cooked and seasoned, but didn't have a lot of flavor - but that was fine because the sauce was intensely flavorful and the shrimp were amazing - lightly battered fried shrimp that reminded me of Chinese take out taken to a level of perfection. 

Finally, for dessert, we couldn't resist the deep fried brownie.  The name is a little misleading - this isn't really a brownie, it is a square of brownie batter frozen, then battered and deep fried.  Don't get me wrong - this isn't a criticism, it is a praise of the sheer genius of it all.  Combined with the ice cream, it forms an amazing amalgam of sweet, gooey batter (you know, the stuff you lick off the spatula at home), crispy batter, slightly baked brownie and cold ice cream. Truly one of the most memorable desserts I've ever had. 

Service was extremely friendly, comfortable and laid back, but pleasantly attentive, the decor is interesting, and the prices are very reasonable.

Highly recommended and would make the trip again if I found myself in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"What a cool little place! Brussel sprout appetizer was very unique and delicious. Airline chicken and the C&C steak were both awesome! Service was very good and staff was very attentive. Thank you very much for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food and service are stellar and you don't have to go to a trendy neighborhood to enjoy it. I'll be in here a lot more."}
{"text":"How lucky are we to have this deliciousness right in our neighborhood?  We've been there 5 times now and leave happy every time. The servers are very friendly and knowledgable with the menu and wine pairing recommendations.  Most recently I've have Gnocchi/Braised Lamb, the gnocchi were like little pillows that held the flavor layers of the lamb and cucumber sauce, the confit wings are great, and the Flat Iron was cooked perfectly. Don't let the little strip mall fool you. This place is great."}
{"text":"OMG, the brussel sprouts. They are reason enough to return. Fantastic wine selection too. I ordered the steak, and it was good. Not the best steak I've had, but it's not a steak house. My husband ordered the pork paprikash and he was not a fan but I thought it was tasty. (He said it was too creamy) We got the bread pudding for dessert and he loved it -- I thought it was okay but I'm not really a bread pudding connoisseur. Service was extraordinary. We will definitely return and probably try different entrees."}
{"text":"It takes a special dining experience for me to overcome my inertial activation energy and muster a review, but Cork and Cleaver has exceeded all expectations. Our Friday night dinner experience for two (4/3/2015), prompted by a referral from our now ex-friend, is as follows:

Bread Service: Pumpernickel with spinach butter. The crust is edible if you can avoid the dense center and use your powers of imagination to conjure any semblance of pumpernickel. On the plus side, grocery store butter is taken down a notch with the inclusion of stringy spinach, presumably to counter those artery clogging butter lipids by making it wholly unappealing. 

Wine: Casa Donoso Close Centenaire. Decent Chilean blend at a 3x markup.

Appetizer 1: The board - roasted bone marrow, braised pork belly, seared foie gras. This reads like a can't miss - the greatest hits of fatty, savory goodness. No, seriously, how do you make any of these ingredients not delicious? First, you can use marrow bones with less marrow than bone. Alright, forgivable, oversight. Next, you can overcook pork belly until it's a solid, hard, mass of jerky with a fat cap. Braising generally implies long, slow cooking in liquid to ensure the meat is tender and moist. Unfortunately here, the meat was likely not rested in the braising liquid post-cook, resulting in a barely chewable chunk of beef that required a bit of sawing with our knives. Finally, foie gras. Unctuous, supple foie gras with a nice caramelized sear. Well, unless you don't use fresh ingredients, don't remove the veins, and undercook it. In which case, you get livery-tasting, gelatinous mass of sinewy duck veins. 

Appetizer 2: Seared scallops - polenta, crispy bacon, truffle honey. Luckily this came out at the same time as \"the board\" and was able to distract us from the horror of overcooked pork belly with its own unique set of ineptitudes. When I read seared scallops, I expect a brown crusty sear, not half-heartedly colored blonde scallops. And definitely not said scallops on top of polenta that is separating from whatever cooking liquid (presumably just water) and a handful of over-crisped bacon/gravel lardons. 

With our first courses out of the way, it was time for mains - redemption time...

Main 1: Flat iron - smoked blue cheese and Brussel gratin, caramelized onion puree. It was about here that I cracked the Cork and Cleaver code. Smoked blue cheese and Brussel gratin roughly translates to what used to be overcooked Brussel sprouts marinating in a soggy mess of blue cheese. But the flat iron steak is really where the kitchen went to work. While more flavorful than more expensive cuts of beef, such as strip or ribeye, flat iron steak is more difficult to cook because a little over or under a perfect medium rare leaves you with a chewy mess and that was exactly what we got. Undercooking aside, shouldn't it be common knowledge now that beef, especially the less tender cuts, absolutely needs to be cut against the grain? I'm sure there've been cooking shows, recipes, and a commandment or two out there about this - right?

Main 2: Gnocchi - braised lamb, cucumber and radish, slaw, tzatziki. They should've just called it a gyro and given us some bread on the side. But unlike a Halal Guys gyro, this was missing both the hot sauce/white sauce options and flavorful lamb. Instead, it was bland shredded ambigu-meat atop dense nuggets of gnocchi dough. And just to show they really care, how about overdressing that with spoonfuls of sour cream and calling it tzatziki.

And just when we thought we had survived, one last insult came with our check. \"Homemade cheddar popcorn\" that ate like packing peanuts and made you thank whichever god you pray to that Smartfood white cheddar exists to balance out this injustice. 

So overall, Cork and Cleaver certainly did not leave us wanting. Maybe they were just having an off-night, or maybe their other seasonal menus are executed more professionally. Whatever the case, we certainly won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced. The waiter was chatty when we just wanted to leave the house to go on a date. Need more variety on their menu."}
{"text":"The strange staff conversation about eczema and other skin ailments aside, the experience was pleasant enough and the food was good but not wowwing.  While I wouldn't say it didn't like the place, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, which is telling because I would have to go pretty far out of my way.  It's in a strip mall in North royalton - ish area.  Not really for me."}
{"text":"I wish that there was one good thing that I could say about the dinner that I just had here with my girlfriend. I have never written a negative review on yelp but I feel so strongly about how bad this restaurant is that I have to add my two cents. Let's start with the service, our server was attentive but truthfully very weird, we both thought he was on drugs. He continually rambled, not letting us speak, telling us about how great the food was and that both the owners were chefs. When we asked for suggestions he said he would recommend anything on the menu while going on about how incredible the preparations are. He actually had me convinced that after a long day of driving, I was in for a great meal. Nothing could be further from the truth. The verve fries were decent but tasted like something I could whip up in 3 minutes out of a can. Super salty, 4/10. Next we had the honey jalapeño chicken wings which tasted like fried chicken with no sauce. Simply awful, 2/10. Who makes chicken wings that taste like plain fried chicken? They were actually sitting on basic plain honey with raw sliced jalapeños and no sauce. By now I was growing weary of what was going to come next. I ordered the $32 \"special\" which consisted of two disgusting grilled shrimp without flavor that were undercooked, a three ounce piece of filet that was just okay, and something that they called bone marrow that still makes me nauseous to think about all these hours later.  Words have trouble describing just how terrible this\" special\" dish was, 0/10. My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken which came highly recommended by our server, like everything else we ordered. Believe it our not, the chicken that was supposedly prepared confit, was so dry that my girlfriend almost choked on her first bite. I am not shitting you. The dry chicken was served on an unnecessarily big, unnecessarily bad bed of macaroni & \"cheese\". It tasted like spoiled milk. No seasoning whatsoever. 0/10. We let them know that we were not satisfied and they did absolutely nothing to remedy the problem. When I asked for the check, and thought that the meal was finally over, it was given to me handwritten and completely illegible. Yes, it was handwritten. The food was actually written on a different side than the drinks. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. The waiter admitted that it was impossible to read and when trying to make sense of it to us, he seemed confused himself. Thankfully I don't live here and will never have to see this restaurant again because I know it will make me sick to think of possibly the worst dining experience of my life."}
{"text":"We stopped last night on a recommendation from our son for my wife's birthday and we're not disappointed.

The Service was excellent!!

The appetizers were very good:
Rueben Ribs -Thousand island slaw, gruyere, rye salt 
Verve Fries-Hand cut fries, garlic sausage gravy 
Had excellent recommended entrees:

Pork Paprikash-Braised pork shoulder, smoked paprika spaetzle, crème fraiche 

Gnocchi-Braised lamb, cucumber and radish slaw, tzatziki (Off the chart)!

Desert:
Country Fried Brownie     Red-eye caramel, pickled cherries, vanilla ice cream.  Mmmmm

Oh yes, almost forgot:
Spaghetti Western     Spicy Bulleit Rye whiskey rides in a posse with bitter orange Campari, Sweet Vermouth, and muddled blackberries, served in an absinthe rinsed glass.
Very good drink!
Overall experience, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty amazing place. It wouldn't be out of place in Ohio City, New York City, Chicago, etc. Our server was fun and informative. Calamari app was excellent. I got the chicken and waffles along with their spinach salad as and it was an amazing combo. Short ribs was the other meal I got to sample and it was a winner. Try this place."}
{"text":"Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Broadview Heights anymore!  You definitely get the feeling you're in a more trendy neighborhood looking at the menu at Cork and Cleaver.  

We came here on my birthday because I've been itching to try this place and thought this would be the perfect excuse.  We walked in and were immediately seated at a table near the door (they said the other room was very cold and we would be much more comfortable here on that frigid evening).  

I ordered the masons mule drink and really enjoyed the Orange flavor mixing with the whisky and ginger beer. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up ordering another one (hey it's my birthday right?) 

For appetizers, we got the fries with sausage gravy and the chicken and waffles.  I think the fries could have been cooked longer; they were floppy and cold in the middle, but I really liked the gravy.  The chicken and waffles had an interesting texture but the flavors were spot on.

I saw the pictures of the chicken and Mac and cheese before I got there and knew that is what I had to order... I was not disappointed!  The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and seasoned perfectly.  The pasta was delicious; the honey drizzle worked so well with the cheese and added something different to the dish.  

The service could have been a little bit better... I think our waiter was confused since my boyfriend was late arriving (the snowstorm got the best of traffic that night) and didn't ask my parents and me if we wanted to place an appetizer order while we waited.  We finally flagged him down and asked.  He was just very awkward and made strange comments the whole night that were probably supposed to be jokes but just sounded strange.  

I wouldn't mind trying this restaurant out again, especially in nicer weather when the patio can be used!"}
{"text":"Very very good meal!  You would never expect such an amazing meal at this little place in an older shopping strip.  Everything about it was perfect!  Great service, great atmosphere, and most importantly great food!  I had the pear salad to start.  I am a vegetarian and they didn't have anything for me on the menu and the chef made me a delicious meal of quinoa and cous cous with veggies and pepitas.  I loved every bite of the whole meal.
My husband got the scallops and said they were perfect.
We shared the fried brownie desert and ....what's better than a brownie sundae??  A FRIED brownie sundae!  great dinner, worth every penny!  We will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"I can find no fault with this restaurant, and everything I tried was delicious and really thoughtfully assembled. 

We arrived as a three top with a reservation, and were promptly seated. We skipped the alcohol, but the cocktail list is wonderful, and the beer and wine choices very good. We started with 3 apps to share; the chicken & waffles, seared scallops over polenta and \"the board\", a nightly changing selection of meats. We got roasted marrow bone with apple butter, seared foie gras with a delightful pickled cherry compote, and pork belly with relish, all served with toast. Delish. The fried chicken & waffles was different; no chicken on the bone here, but house made tenders on waffle triangles...very good. The scallops and polenta were also excellent. I had the pork paprikash as a main, which was a loose translation of the traditional dish; slow cooked pork shoulder pressed into a rectangular shape, served with creme fraiche over spaetzel flavored with smoked paprika. No complaints there. 

Service here is excellent, helpful and attentive as well as knowledgable. I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"We came for a special birthday celebration for my family and I wasn't sure what to expect as I did look at the menu and some reviews before I arrived.  When you walk in, it is pretty, can definitely tell they re did it a little bit, added a nice bar, new furniture etc.  They even have a cute little patio in the front.  

I think just the menu is not quite up my alley.  I tried a few pieces of calamari to start and they were good, not chewy, definitely fresh just the sauce they paired it with was a bit odd.  I then got a Caesar salad.  They smeared the dressing on the plate instead of pre-tossing it with the lettuce which made it hard to eat, some pieces had too much dressing and some had too little, what was very good were these fried chicken croutons.  

For my meal I got the pork paprikash, the pork is very smokey, too smokey for me, but it was a huge serving of pork.  Then the spaetzle's were on the much smaller side from what I am used to so I feel like I didn't get the true feeling it was paprikash.  The creme fraiche is what makes the dish and is necessary in every bite to really round out the flavors.  

I tried my mom's fried chicken and mac n cheese and really wish I would of went with that, the breading was very crispy and the mac n cheese was good from my few bites.

As far as I dessert I tried a bite of the deep fried brownie, it was a bit weird because the brownie wasn't necessarily cooked on the inside and it was very runny.

I am glad I tried it but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Our meal was exceptional. We each had a salad before our dinner. I had the wedge, my husband had the mushroom and mom had the beet. All were very good. For dinner, mom and hubby had the fried chicken and macaroni and cheese. Our waitress said this item has been on the menu since day one. I can understand why after sampling the dish. I had the trout which was also delicious. For desert, the bread pudding is a must. The presentation of the meal was a delight. Because the menu is limited it is easy to see that each dish was prepared to satisfy the eye and the palette. We definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood gem of a restaurant. The server Mandy was outstanding and the bartender ronnie was the best. It's a must place to go for awesome food and super drinks."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits here we can safely and assuredly recommend C&C. Not a segment in any plate has been less than perfect. Try anything! We've loved the walleye, pork paprikas, mussels and desserts. Try anything. Is all marvelous."}
{"text":"From beginning to end the service and food were excellent. The Board was an awesome beginning. That is after the super creamy butter they make for their bread! I had the Iron medium rare. Mouthwatering is the only way to describe it.  The side of Brussels sprouts roasted with blue cheese, by far the best way ever to prepare them! My handsome companion had the chef soup which was beer cheese made with milk stout. Nothing wrong about that! We would have liked a larger beer selection as we are beer aficionados. That said we will be back to try more creative taste bud tempting cuisine!"}
{"text":"Overall great food.  Appetizers were good.  Wedge salad was amazing.  Lamb gnocchi was delicious and good sized portion.  Suggested non alcoholic drink was absolutely delicious. Other diners meals- beets, flat iron, and scallops all were well reviewed by fellow diners.  Wait staff were very courteous and knowledgable. Overall would recommend."}
{"text":"We ate at the Cork & Cleaver last night celebrating our Anniversary. This is a Farm to table experience, the server told us the veggies were grown just down the street. It was by far one of the best dinning experiences we have ever had. We may have found our favorite local restaurant. We started with the seasonal Salad that had fresh tomatoes , cucumber slices with a tomato vinaigrette on arugula with a grilled cheese that was to die for. If you are dining there in the summer I would recommend asking for their seasonal salads, this is one of the best salads I have ever had! For the Main coarse I had the Pork Paprikash and my husband had the Salmon that was the special for the night. We shared each dinner both were exceptional!!
Don't skip dessert!!, we usually do not indulge on dessert when we go out, but this was a special occasion so we decided to split a dessert. We had the Bread Pudding Smores style drizzled with this dark chocolate and marshmallows, I have never had a better dessert!! It was a large portion so was nice we ended up sharing."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend....got there at 800 on a Saturday night....a little crowded at the time so we sat at the bar...ordered a dirty martini....very good...then ordered the meatloaf... It was awesome melt in your mouth...I will definitely return to try more from this unique menu"}
{"text":"Excellent food, the lamb was very rich because of the sauce, the gnocchi were very flavorful.  The pork Paprikash I would not get again. I just didn't like the texture of the pork once it was formed and the spaetzl were kind of small.  My preference, others may like it. Waiter was attentive and experienced. Ambiance....it was an LA type restaurant setting, in a strip mall, looking out onto cars parked up against the side walk. I would put up some type of screening on the front plate glass window, bamboo or wood screen. They sat us facing the parking lot, rather than the restaurant. 
The place was practically empty on a Weds night, then one other table came in. But they still acted like it was an issue that we didn't have reservations?"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful had the Reuben ribs app along with the steak for dinner. Dessert was to die for."}
{"text":"From the same guy who brought us Graffiti Social Kitchen comes this charming little restaurant hidden away in a strip mall in Broadview Heights. Not your usual spot for high-end fare, C&C will take you by surprise. With a variety of unique dishes to choose from, if you're looking for some new food combos or want to be wowed by the chef's creativity, then this spot is a must."}
{"text":"Yes, it's in a strip mall. Sure, it's done up nicely enough with harvest gold walls, oak barrel tables, textured wall coverings and the like but it just felt chincy and disjointed. Perhaps it was the drop ceiling, the beer bottle lights over the bar or the clunky plastic lightbox signage out front. For a place where a couple should expect to pay $100 for a dinner and drinks, the atmosphere just didn't match.

The menu at the Cork & Cleaver is a concise exercise. The selections are a mash-up of seemingly disparate styles that, outside of the melting pot of the region, wouldn't stand a chance - braised lamb gnocchi shares a table with pork paprikash while across the room the chicken and waffles holds hands with the likes of roasted bone marrow and foie gras. There's even a vegan dish that sticks out like Steven Hawking at a tractor pull.

Another disappointment, no draft beer. Actually, their beer selection in general is rather non-existent save for a rough half-dozen bottles hidden at the bottom of the drink menu. No local beer love either. The clear focus is on pricy \"craft\" cocktails and wine so this didn't come as much of a surprise.

The meal starts with a complimentary basket of fresh pumpernickel bread served with a schmear of spinach and cream cheese butter. A playful take on the ever-present potluck staple, I imagine. Poking fun at classics was to be a consistent theme.

Rueben Ribs - Take the flavors of a Rueben sandwich, the tenderness of fall-off-the-bone pork ribs, the freshness of housemade slaw and a sprinkling of rye salt and you'll get the idea. Thousand island dressing adds just the right amount of acid and creaminess. A brilliant take on a tired deli classic.

Chicken and Waffles - I've had this iconic dish in so many places I thought I'd seen it all. Not quite. Two petite waffles herbed with thyme and cooked a perfect golden brown, a pair of fried chicken cakes (imagine a crab cake but with moist and tender dark meat chicken) topped with spicy butter to bring some heat and a drizzle of dark maple syrup. Flawless.

Seared Scallop App - A pair of obscenely plump Bay scallops, seared and placed atop a bed of golden polenta and a scattering of chunky bacon bits. The coup de grace, truffled honey oil. The scallops were like butter and the sweetness of the polenta and honey balanced perfectly with the salty crisp of the bacon. 

Caesar Salad - Not your mama's Caesar, this one's got Japanese mustard greens called Mizuna, radicchio, and whole olives. Sure, it's got the Caesar dressing and parmesan cheese, but it's the pair of fried chicken cakes (the same as those served with the chicken and waffles dish) that makes it all come together. Not a bad salad, just not great.

Mushroom Salad - After overhearing a server tout this as his favorite I had to give this one a spin. Frisee lettuce, toasted panko crumble, butter and garlic sautéed mushrooms and a poached egg. I imagine the concept was to have the egg yolk act as the \"dressing\" of this salad but I just didn't get it. The egg was perfectly poached, there just wasn't enough to go around. Missing some acid it was a bit one-note and slightly dry.

Pork Paprikash - It was 100-degrees outside but as soon as I read the words I couldn't help myself. Once again, I was surprised by the chef's creativity. They braise whole pork shoulder in-house, shred the meat, compress, slice, pan-fry the cube of pig goodness and serve it atop a bed of miniature spaetzel in a smoked paprika sauce. A dollop of crème fraiche oozes. The pork was so tender it laughed at the fact that I even had a knife and the slight smoke flavor was brilliant. Filling, flavorful and fatty.

Deep-fried Brownie - I normally steer clear of the deep-fried desserts as they tend to be greasy messes not worth the inevitable gut distress, but something told me that they'd get it right here. They did. The homemade brownie is Tempura battered, fried just long enough to turn the brownie back into gooey batter, topped with a scoop of (also made in-house) vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of caramel sauce and dusting of coffee powder. A trio of sour cherries adds to the beautiful mess. Ho-ly shit this was good. End of story.

Aside from a few slight missteps along the way, the Cork and Cleaver experience was a very good one for us. The menu is full of surprises, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive and their use of locally sourced ingredients is to be applauded. It's a strange mix of cultures going on - a guy wearing shorts and a tank top, another in a $1200 suit and French cuffs, servers touting $15 apps sporting black t-shirts and plenty of arm ink, drinks served in mason jars. High-brow eatery? Upscale pub? Casual bistro? I'm not really sure what it is and I got the feeling they were still trying to figure it out, too. The one thing I am sure about, though, is that these guys can cook, interior design be damned."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times to meet friends for dinner.  We always start with a drink in the bar.  I like their house \"mule\" drink, but they have a nice selection of beer and cocktails.

For appetizers, we are hooked on their lard cooked fries with sausage gravy.  

For our dinners, my wife tried the pork loin special.  It came with a selection of fall vegetables cooked and wrapped in a puff pastry.  I got my usual pork paprikash, it's do good that I just cannot risk trying something else on the menu lest it doesn't measure up to the paprikash!

If you like interesting dishes, but don't want the hassle of driving downtown or to Tremont, then this is where you need to be.  

I know I will be back for a third visit!"}
{"text":"I after hearing about this place I called my cousins from the west side and made a reservation. We arrived and were seated right away  our server Greg came over and described some cocktails as well as the beers and brought some delicious warm pumpernickel bread with a spinach, garlic, Parmesan , and butter spread delicious. From there we had the verve fries , the chicken and waffles and the Reuben ribs all we fantastic and highly recommended. For entrees my guests ordered the scallops, the omelet, and the paprika ah. One guest was vegetarian and Greg and the chef were more than willing to accommodate. The made the omelet minus the sausage and it was light fluffy and fantastic. I left my meal in the hands of the Chef and he sent me Gnocchi the gnocchi were light and cooked perfectly just like Grandma used to make. The lamb was super tender and flavorful and the tZaki sauce was the best I've ever had Greg paired a wonderful Wine for me a claret that was on the glass pour list went perfect. We finished with very good coffee and three exquisite desserts the Banana, the apples and Brie ice cream and the brownie it was all fantastic. One of the chefs Brian stopped by and made sure everything was great, and invited us to return we can't wait to come back. And tell all my friends about it as we'll.  you definitely will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The Chicken Livers were on point but the Veal Schnitzel was a total let down - very dry, a bit tough, not a lot of flavor. Definitely stay away from one of their most popular dishes. Or you could just mark it up as I don't like Schnitzel...but that would be a total lie.

Best thing on the menu...Peach OL Fashion. Best thing I the restaurant...Bookers - kinda hard to mess up a good bourbon on rocks though.

Overall, pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I thought this was a great choice for dinner. Very intimate and nice! Food was excellent and couldn't be happier with the prices, fair for what you're getting. Only set back was we didn't make reservations and I think that put the owner in a bad mood. So make reservations!"}
{"text":"Easily the best food outside of Cleveland, and maybe anywhere in Cleveland. Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in this area, hands down! It's a taste of Tremont/Ohio city in the suburbs and has a great vibe to it. Recommend this place 100 times over!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Cork & Cleaver. I went there with my girlfriend for dinner a few nights ago. 

We ordered scallops and meatballs as or appatizer course. The scallops were delicious. The meatball app, however, no thanks. A little \"cool\" and not a whole lot of flavor. 

Entrees consisted of gnocchi served with braised lamb for her, while I opted for the C & C Steak. Both dishes were tasty. We finished our meal with some sort of fried brownie which was also very good, albeit completely unnecessary. 

What I liked the best about C & C, aside from the food though, was the service. We had a delightful waitress who really made the evening feel like an event. 

The atmosphere of the place is also welcome for this side of town. Casual enough for jeans, but you won't feel out of place in a pair of slacks either. Just the right touch of class.

All in all Cork & Cleaver was a pleasant experience, and I'm looking forward to trying some of their other offerings in the near future."}
{"text":"The tables are packed in like sardines in a can and the noise level is so high that you can forget about hearing about the daily specials, let alone talk to fellow diners. The food was just ok. We were just glad to get it over with and have some peace and quiet."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding and the service is nothing short of excellent! I took a vegan friend here and they prepared her a delicious beet \"steak\" off the menu. If it was closer I'd definitely go back more often. Glad to have their sister restaurant \"Graffiti\" so close!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the great reviews, honestly! This place is overpriced, had mediocre food and the service was slow. Another issue I found perplexing was their menu, it was flat out confusing for the first time visitor. Here's a typical example: One main course was listed as \"C & C Spaghetti\". Our table discussed this selection trying to guess what the \"C's\" meant, because the menu didn't say anything on how the Spaghetti was prepared! Finally we asked the waitress who told us hurriedly it stands for CORK & CLEAVER! So... How is it prepared? Just like any other Spaghetti! Huh! I can tell you as someone who's eaten a lot of spaghetti in his life, there is a billion ways to prepare the plate. Not just \"the us sua way\"! So this was really my first and last try. By the way, there are at least 5 other extremely good upscale eateries near this place that are better on every count!"}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place!  Everything we ordered was just delicious!  For appetizers we had the fried pickles with aioli and the Brussel sprouts. So yummy!  The pumpernickel bread with spinach butter was scrumptious. There were 4 of us and we all ordered something different and everybody loved their food. Swordfish, steak, scallops and short ribs. The poached pear salad was heavenly as was the beet salad. The atmosphere was lovely and our waitress was so attentive. I can't wait to go back. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Every thing is always perfect even with special requests. My boyfriend loves the mushroom salad on the old menu! Everyone should enjoy the flat iron steak, it's cooked to perfection and the pairings with it are incredible."}
{"text":"Drinks.Food.Service= AMAZING! 

Heard about this place for awhile now and was always skeptical about the food options. WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR?!?!   We sat at the bar and I had the peach fizz drink which was delicious and strong! We split the beet salad and pork chops. I was blown away with the Pork Chops... it was large, juicy, and full of flavor. Would definitely recommend. Can't wait for more trips to this social kitchen in the burbs :)"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been here many of times and always enjoyed the food and the experience. So when my family asked me where I would like to go for a birthday dinner I mentioned I hadn't been here for a while and it would be nice to go back. As always the food and our server John were excellent. The one catch was my mom and fiancée brought a cake. As soon as my fiancée walked in with the cake the manager ran to the door and said there would be a fee of 6 bucks a head for us to eat the cake there. I guess I understand why they do it, but we have been to many places celebrating many events and having a cake has never been an issue. We usually cut it ourselves and bring paper plates, share with the staff etc. The manager never came to our table to talk an attempted negotiation of the cake fee through our waiter. When my mom made a negative comment on the Facebook page regarding her opinion of the cake fee some \"friends\" of the people who worked there called her a \"hillbilly\" for bringing her own cake. We went to the closest house and shared our cake so in the end all was well but I will not be returning to this or any of their other restaurants."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Cork and Cleaver last night for my birthday because I've heard so many great things.  The three stars is based on our experience and I can almost guarantee that the customers around us would give this restaurant 4-5 stars.  Our waitress would not give us the time of day. She would pour water in our glasses in passing and would not even ask us how we were doing or ask if we wanted  a drink, order an appetizer or dinner etc. etc. You get the drift.  At some point I monitored our waitress to see how many times she would go to the other tables and I think I figured out, the table across the room had four guests and numerous bottles of wine and it seemed like her priority was pouring their drinks and catering to them.  I can't prove it, but to me it's a strong indicator that she catered to larger table assuming it would be a better tip for her.  When the manager took the time to serve our dinner I let her know how poor the service was and she definitely made it right with us.  

The food was good, it was different,nothing you would find in other restaurants, I liked that. However I wasn't impressed with the $9.00 wedge salad that wasn't really a wedge, but two large chunks."}
{"text":"What an amazing find!  Was in town on business and just stumbled upon this gem. Every dish was amazing.  Had dinner with some friends and all of us raved about our selections.  Kudos to the chef(s) and staff for an amazing meal and friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing.  The Fall salad was light with plenty of flavor. If my wife was with me we could have split that and the entree.  Which was AMAZING!!!  Veal Schnitzel with dumplings and mushrooms plus the perfect creamy coleslaw on top.  A couldn't pass up the dessert either.  Country fried brownie.  OMG. Wha a great meal all around.  Ambience is great, low light good music.  Michael my waiter was top notch.  It was a Tuesday so it wasn't super busy but i'm sure that changes on the weekend.  If you haven't been here before you definitely need to make a trip. If I'm ever back in the area again I will certainly come back and try something else. Great job Cork & Cleaver!"}
{"text":"Okay, so the name is misleading because this was not a very social kitchen.
 My wife stopped by and asked me to meet her for a drink and appetizers after work. There was about three tables and no one at the bar. She was asked if she had a reservation. What? Since she went to the bar of course she didn't have to wait for a table. Of which 90% were open... Anyway, they don't have any draft beers. She took a gamble and a ordered bottle of beer and didn't really care for it, but she knew I would drink it if she didn't. No big deal.
 The bartender was a complete and total dick. I don't know if he didn't care for \"our kind\" there, maybe he was having a bad night, or maybe he was just an asshole. I really don't know the answer to that question. We asked him about a drink he was making and he gave us a snarky answer. He pretty much ignored us even though we were the only customers at the bar. Granted, he had orders from tables coming in, but as I said earlier, there weren't a lot of tables in there. If he was overwhelmed by the amount of tables that were there, he was an amateur. After asking a couple of questions and getting very short nasty answers, we gave up. Paid for our drink and split. Again I don't know what his problem was but I'll never go back and find out. We were prepared to lay down a little bit of money there this evening, chill and have some good food and drink. Instead they got paid for one beer and a tip.
 I hope the extreme attitude was worth it to lose out on a whole check."}
{"text":"Superb find for Broadview Heights. Sampled a bit of everything from the menu and was not disappointed whatsoever. 

Pumpernickel break with spinach and garlic butter was a nice start. Got the ribs for an appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised by the Reuben taste. One of the best beet salads I've ever had. The goat cheese was the perfect flavor pairing.

Sampled the steak, gnocchi and bangers. Heaven in your mouth taste. The best however was the pork paprikash with spaetzle. Perfect balance of salty with the creamy orange sauce.

The waitress was nice enough to bring some almond Carmel corn to the table before leaving. 

Overall, a great top restaurant find out in the burbs."}
{"text":"I am so sad to be writing this review. I've been going to cork and cleaver for special events for a few years now. I've never had a bad experience until tonight. 
First, we arrived a few minutes late, not a huge deal. Our party was for 13 people. When I got there. There were two standard tables pushed together. Normally that would be fine. But, there were 13 of us. Actually, 14 ended up showing up. Instead of putting another table together, we were forced to smush, literally smush all 14 of us into 2 tables. It was actually so uncomfortable, my friend sat on my other friends lap. I understand it's a small establishment, but if you couldn't accommodate 13 of us comfortably, you should have said so. We were literally elbow to elbow. At one point, my brother in law and sister decided to leave because they were just too uncomfortable.
Our server was polite, she did however forget our drinks on multiple occasions and we had to continue to remind her about them. 
Our food was fantastic. For mine and my husbands apps, we got the wings and the Reuben short ribs. They were delicious.
Our main courses were the the steak and pork poperkosh. They were both very delicious.
I ordered a shrub for my drink and was happy with it. My husband was not. So he ordered something different. 

Here's where it gets really messed up.
I brought in a cake, my mother in law specially made for my husband. Because we were there celebrating his Birthday. Mind you, this is a homemade cake, already cut into pieces. The only thing that needed to be done was put on plates and handed out. They did tell me it would be a $4 charge. BUT A $4 PER PERSON? We got our bill and my husbands great mood went from happy to pissed. $52 to serve MY cake? Are you kidding me? On top of the gratuity and the hundreds of hundreds of dollars we spent tonight? $52??
Normally, I wouldn't complain about this. But, this is ridiculous! You guys should be ashamed of yourself. Not everyone can eat your desserts, so we brought something everyone could eat and you charged me $52?
I LOVED coming in here, having Brian pick our meals for Valentine's day, our anniversaries, our Birthdays. But, I kind of feel like I was taken advantage of. Like, we even started making shrubs in our home because of this place. Now? Now, we won't be back. Because of tonight's events, you've lost our business."}
{"text":"Very nice place with very attentive servers! My water glass was always full :) 

I had the Wonton Soup with The Omelette, and my friend had the C&C Salad with Chicken and Waffles. The Omelette was so different and 100% delicious! I would def order it again!  The wonton soup had a good taste but there wasn't much to it. My friend said the chicken and waffles were very good too - this was the first time she had it!

They said the spring menu would be coming out about mid-April! I'm looking forward to coming back to try it!"}
{"text":"Came here with the whole family the other day. We made reservations over the phone, but it seemed that they got lost somewhere. Fortunately we were still able to be seated as they were not fully booked for the evening. The decor was modern and inviting. I loved the glass tabletops. It has a slightly upscale feel, but casual attire is still appropriate.

The waitress was very attentive and everything came out in a timely manner. I ordered the mason's mule, as I love mules, but I should have looked more closely before ordering as it was made with whiskey instead of vodka. It was a well made drink, but I'm not a fan of whiskey. We ordered 3 appetizers to share- the chicken livers, the fried pickles, and the Brussels sprouts. All of the appetizers were great. I especially loved the fried pickles. They were house made pickles with awesome flavor and they had a great dill dipping sauce. I ordered the short ribs for my entree and they were pretty good. I wasn't swept off my feet, but I wasn't disappointed either. We all split a brownie for dessert. The brownie was excellent. 

Overall it was a good meal. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was satisfying. With the check came mini chocolate chip cookies. It was a nice little surprise, but the cookies would have been better made with butter instead of shortening."}
{"text":"This is officially my new favorite place!  
We went on a Friday evening about 6:30 hoping there would not b an issue getting in.  
Well the inside was booked up w/reservations, but the outside patio is 1st come 1st serve.  We got lucky!  The weather was great and there were a few tables open. 

I want to start w/our server.  He was fantastic!  He knew the menu up and down and backwards! When asked what he liked, he told us honestly.  We went with his suggestions and loved everything!

Apps- we had the fries w/sausage gravy.  Cooked in real lard!  I'm not a super freaky health nut.  I know dozens if old people who grew up on farms eating lard and lived into their 90's!   So bring it!  Oh, and damn they were deeeeeeeeelicious!

Entrees-  I got the gnocchi with lamb. Outstanding!!! Its been a couple days since I was there and I'm already craving more! 

I tried the fried chix w/Mac and cheese.  Very good!

Also tried the flat iron steak and it's accompaniments,  all outstanding!

Dessert- must get the bread pudding w/the candy pieces....oh-my-gawd!

The server also mentioned how there is some rare onions in one dish and how they own a garden too, fresh stuff!"}
{"text":"We had the appetizer sea scallops served with the polenta bacon and honey. The scallops were so fresh and properly cooked; the polenta was the creamiest we've ever had, and the combination of bacon and honey was just amazing. We also had pork tenderloin served with pickled peaches, apples, soaked cornbread, fried plantains. Everything was devoured, each bite perfectly balanced with so much flavor. We felt like we were eating something from \"Chopped\". The fried brownie dessert was the best brownie we've ever had. The service was spot-on, absolutely flawless. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is a small, intimate place in Broadview Heights for dinner. It's in a plaza, which sometimes restaurants in plazas are not exactly pleasing to the eye, but it did not disappoint. We had great service, and some really delicious food.
We started with \"the board\" - foi gras, pork belly, and bone marrow. MMMM, it was good!!! Everything was very flavorful. 
Their complimentary bread and butter was just OK. The bread was good but the butter was eh...
They had a few decent bottles beers to choose from, and a few signature cocktails. We tried the Mule, but I would not recommend- it tasted like ginger beer and only ginger beer. 
For our entrees we got the Gnocchi (tzikiki sauce, lamb, radishes)- super unique and tasty dish. And we got the duck- with a carrot pastry- it was very flavorful and delicious. 
Service was good, ambience was intimate, simply lit, upscale casual...prices were as expected for such type of place. 
We would come back!"}
{"text":"Went last night for my boyfriends birthday...his first time there. He said the pork paprikash was the best meal he's ever had! The c&c steak was phenomenal! Service impeccable. Awesome atmosphere! One of my fave restaurants."}
{"text":"-DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS PLACE-

Cork & Cleaver is a small location in between an automotive shop and a few small businesses, but don't let that deter you from going here. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is pleasant and attentive, and the food is outstanding.

We had \"The Board\" as an appetizer, which included Pork Belly, Bone Marrow, and Foie Gras. Things that my girlfriend and I are not really overly accustomed to eating. We thought we'd try it and everything was delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the Foie Gras, but it was cooked and prepared well, it just wasn't for me.

I decided on the Veal Schnitzel for dinner, and my girlfriend chose the Duck. I loved my dish, it was perfectly cooked and did not drop from the standard of the appetizer. She enjoyed her Duck as well. This is quality food.

We finished off the night with some coffee and Carrot Cake. It was good too.

We left full and enjoyed our visit. Dishes weren't seam-splitting so we felt great afterwards (unlike when you've eaten too much and feel overly lethargic or sick), it was just enough food to give you that healthy 'full' feeling.

There really wasn't one thing that was bad to eat here. My mouth waters at the thought of going back. It is a bit pricey, but well worth what it costs. They also have specials (such as rainbow trout when we went) and seem to always be coming up with something new or different.

If you decide to stop by, I suggest getting there at the opening hour, or placing a reservation. This place fills up quick."}
{"text":"Service is great.  They have some crazy flavor combinations- most of them work.  If not, they have always gotten me something else.  I like that they are local, raise some of the food on a farm and are very cordial.  As good as anything in Tremont and I don't have to deal with hipsters"}
{"text":"Great little strip mall find in Suburban Cleveland! The ambience (budget redo of a one-time Chinese Restaurant?) doesn't quite do justice to the really fabulous and creative menu. Highlights? Reuben Ribs and the Gnocchi. Mmmmm.... Everything we ate was delicious. And... locovore heaven. All farm fresh, and great service."}
{"text":"looking forward to going, the food sounds great, the over rated Melt place on rockside road is no longer tickling our fancy.  this place sounds like it has great kitchen; just wondering if the price for dinner for two is reasonable or high end?  Most folks describe small or tiny portions on square plates, so hope all the soup and sides that go with are filling."}
{"text":"We had our first experience here last night. We were a party of 4 and we each ordered a taster (appetizer). A large board with assorted items, ($17 )fried homemade pickles (5 pickle slices $10) seared scallops ($17) just 2 scallops! Fried chicken wings ( I think 5). Food was ok but prices for said items was too much for too little."}
{"text":"Excellent experience for our first time trying this neighborhood restaurant. So pleased to have this kind of adventurous restaurant in our own backyard, rather than having to venture several miles north or east. The lamb and gnocchi was so unique, decadent and, of course, delicious! Will definitely be back to experience more of the diverse menu, which I hope evolves season to season - from the cocktails all the way down the line, through to the desserts!"}
{"text":"Honestly, if I could give 4 1/2 (or 3/4) I would have, because Cork And Cleaver is outstanding in its own right, but a half step below a couple of others that I have given 5 stars.  They do quite a bit with a strip mall location, and their theory of variations on comfort food theme is very clever, but execution is that half-step missing.  I started with the Beet Salad, which I whole-hardheartedly recommend.  The yellow beets are almost savory, and paired with goat cheese, herbs, and walnuts it is an amazingly singular salad.  I went with the Pork Paprikash, which came over house-made spaetzel.  The pork was shredded and then roasted as a block which was topped with sour cream, and covered with the paprikash sauce.  The pork was tender and moist, but the dish was too heavy,  The spaetzel was perfect, until it was minimized in size, perhaps in a too-cute take on pork & beans.  I enjoyed what I ate, but it sat heavily in my stomach.   I paired the meal with a German Riesling, which came generous, by the glass.  I finished off with the Apples and Brie, which came as apple-stuffed perogies with tart apple straws covered in a caramel sauce beside a spectacular Brie ice cream.  If you stop by, this is the dessert to get, no question!  I, of course, paired that with an Oban scotch, but they offered signature cocktails, I heard tell of house-made artisan spirits, as well.  Well worth a stop, I will very likely be back, and I recommend Cork and Cleaver very highly."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Went for dinner. Started with the peaches and cream cocktail, as delicious as it sounds! The Reuben ribs were amazing and I don't even like corned beef. Had a salad and couple other appetizers, both delicious! Had the gyro gnocchi for an entree, we were hesitant, but after reassurance from server, we gave it a shot. Creamy, rich, delicate gnocchi, and tons of lamb...was not sure what to expect, but loved it."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem, you would never know how amazing it is from looking at the exterior. We have been twice, both times it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The servers are so helpful and definitely above average. We loved everything we tried, especially the rueben ribs, pork paprikash and gnocchi. The food is so flavorful and so much more unique than what you typically find in Cleveland (even at other New American / trendy restaurants). The cocktails are also great, and just strong enough. Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"I am always looking for an excuse to try new places, so I decided to take my employees here for our christmas dinner.  What this restaurant lacks in location and rich interior decor , it more than makes up for in its food and service. I didn't think I would ever give out 5 stars because, lets face it, no one is perfect, but the gastronomical satisfaction to dollar ratio of this place got that 5th star out of me.  Our waiter was very engaging and informative. He did a good job of giving a personal aspect to his explanation of the menu. We had 8 people and a wide range of palates and preferences. I started off by ordering the Verve fries, Rueben Ribs, and Chicken and waffles for appetizers. Everyone was very impressed with each of them. I was most interested in the chicken and waffles and Rueben ribs, but was blown away by how good the verve fries were!  We  ended up ordering 7 different entrees and everyone seemed to completely enjoy each of their meals. I had the omelette. It goes without saying that it was the best omelette I have ever tasted. The combination of flavors and textures was perfect. It was a 5star omelette. I also had a bite of the Gnocchi. It again had several layers of flavors that was highlighted by the tzatziki  sauce. I also heard raves about the chicken w/ mac n cheese, and scallops. We finished with the fried brownie and apple pirogi with brie icecream. I was too full to partake but once again heard a lot of sounds of enjoyment from the rest of the table. I really wanted this to be a special night for my empoyees who work so hard throughout the year, and was worried about my choice because of never having been there before. Cork and Cleaver proved to be the perfect choice and it made for a great evening. I have had few dining experiences in Ohio that have come close to this."}
{"text":"COMFORT FOOD WITH A TWIST! Oh my this place is phenomenal! Try the Pork Paprikash, it won't disappoint. Everything on the menu is excellent. The service is awesome! Their drinks are tastes & natural. Definitely a great place for a date night!!"}
{"text":"Really nice place, nice owners. Was here mid October. Got the Walleye special. Piping hot meal and good quality. If there were more options with the sides this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall. Atmosphere is strip mall-ish. Food was good but service was mediocre. In order to go to the restrooms you have to walk past the staff/kitchen area where people were talking and being very vulgar. Food was good but the staff will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great experience. The service was great and very knowledgeable. Our waiter had phenomenal suggestions. The food was great, but not sure about the price. Don't skip dessert. The carrot cake was pretty good. We would visit Cork & Cleaver again."}
{"text":"Good service, good food in an eclectic atmosphere. We had a flat iron steak (very good), the reuben ribs (aptly named) and the pork paprikash which was , to my taste, a bit bland but perfectly cooked to fork tender. Their wings are some of the best if not the best I have enjoyed--they will bring me back. Our desserts were lemon coconut panecotta and the crispiest brownie puddle which I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"This was perfect. Service, menu, value and execution. Perfect. My two dining companions and I all think that this was a terrific experience. We all had a terrible time deciding on what to order from this interesting and creative menu. 

I ordered an Heirloom Tomato Bloody Mary.  It was great. Not too spicy, just right. 
I loved my Caesar salad with chicken croutons. (check out the pics on Yelp). The Bangers were delicious. Three types of sausages with condiments and nicely spiced potatoes. Delightful. Perfect portion.  Finished with the apple turnovers with Brie ice cream. The caramel was nice as was the ice cream. The pastry needs work. It's a little tough and short in filling. Had some unremarkable decaf to finish. I can't wait to return to try more."}
{"text":"if i could give ZERO stars i would......THANK YOU FOR RUINING OUR SPECIAL OCCASION!! i have never witnessed such incompetence by a restaurant in my life.......drinks, good, food - I DON'T KNOW, WE NEVER ATE!!!! waiter brought out salads BEFORE our appetizers, i didn't want it, i wanted my appetizer, when my appetizer finally showed up, my guest's appetizer was missing.......we waited, waited, waited, still, there i am with my food getting cold, waiting for my guest's food to arrive, not eating anything because we're there to EAT TOGETHER. finally i asked to speak to the manager, told him that the service is rediculous, we're being served out of sync, waiting for food to show up while the other's is sitting on the table getting cold. and the MOST DISGUSTING THINGS IS THAT ONE WAITER IS WIPING HIS SWEATY BROW WITH HIS HAND, THEN CONTINUED TOUCHING PATRON'S PLATES AND GLASSES, THE HOSTESS/BUSGIRL KEPT TOUCHING HER LONG BLONDE HAIR, THEN SETTING UP TABLES, PICKED UP OUR WATER GLASSES AND FILLED THEM, ALL WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A HAND WASH OR A BREAK IN BETWEEN PUSHING HER HAIR BACK.....if this is what goes on, on the floor, what is happening behind the scenes????? JUST GROSS........sweat, hair, hair products and who knows what else, touching my glasses, silverware, etc. 
manager/owner was nice, but at this point i was so disgusted, so mad and disappointed! I WOULD NEVER, EVER, EVER, RETURN AND RECOMMEND THAT MY FAMILY & FRIENDS AVOID THIS PLACE!!!! THIS \"RESTAURANT\"  IS A DISASTER, DISPITE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS, what do people in broadview heights know? compared to the local dive bar and denny's this is special.....well, it's not.
terribly disappointed, thanks for ruining our night........i should have gone to tremont, ohio city or downtown for a good dinner, with professional staff."}
{"text":"gastronomic bliss
unassuming location
foodie shock and awe

I've been meaning to come here since this place opened a year ago. 
-Now I could kick myself for not going sooner. 
Arguably the best food in Cleveland. A concise menu focused on perfect execution as opposed to a sprawling menu of mediocrity.  Also the \"local and house made\" theme is taken to another level by the restaurant having its own plot of veggies in an old repurposed dairy farm. 

Here's what we had:  a board with seared scallops on a warm corn relish type thing, foie gras and toast points, and the \"reuben ribs\". The ribs were brined in a pastrami-ish brine then cooked and served over a cabbage slaw.  Brilliant.
Entree's were a swordfish and I had fried chicken with mac&cheese.  All I can say is that it was a flawless meal.  

Run to Cork and Cleaver.  RUN!!!

Carry on..."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food and excellent service.  I expected a lot of vegetarian options since it's so tightly linked to a local farm.  However, there was only 1.  They were able to provide me with a large serving of the vegetables of the day, which were delicious.  I really think they are missing an opportunity in not having a large vegetarian section given how many west siders are vegetarian and there are NO vegetarian spots on the southwest side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Unique entres you will not find elsewhere. Prices were not unreasonable. Without a doubt one of the best restaurants in the entire area. Not a place for cocktails though. Skimpy and expensive. 

Bob, North Royalton"}
{"text":"A surprisingly cute and sophisticated restaurant at the end of an out-of-the-way strip mall. The exterior is unassuming, but the interior has clean and modern decor with quirky touches (chalkboard on the wall; drinks in mason jars). 

I went with a group, and we were all impressed with each dish. Several of us enjoyed the Stellar cocktail (peach vodka with cream, honet syrup, and soda)-- light and refreshing for spring. I enjoyed the Caesar salad which is not a traditional Caesar but frisee and shredded greens in a light creamy sauce; the accompanying chicken croutons (chicken confit coated with panko and fried in little cubes) were the standouts. Others really enjoyed the verve fries and reuben ribs. Fried tomatillos were reminiscent of fried green tomatoes--crispy and well prepared.

For entree, several of had the scallop special with tomatillo sauce, pineapples, and guacamole topped with sweet potato fries. This was excellent; the scallops were fresh and well prepared, and the sauces were tangy and delicious without overwhelming the taste of the scallops. Others enjoyed the omelet, which was impressively light and fluffy. One person ordered a steak which was accidentally overcooked; it was brought out by one of the owners, Brian, with an apology and the comment that another entree was being prepared, but he wanted the patron to have something to eat in the meantime.

Most of us were too full for dessert, but one order of the lemon and coconut was thoroughly enjoyed (crumbled shortbread with coconut panna cotta, merengue, and lemon curd on top. )

It wasn't too crowded on a Wed night. The service was prompt and friendly, and our server was able to give good recommendations. I was impressed that the accidentally overcooked dish was rectified with an apology before we had to say anything.The out of the way location is a bit of a deterrent, but I would definitely make the trip out here again."}
{"text":"Our second visit, two different dishes, and another five stars. Ho-hum, Cork and Cleaver, ho-hum. Only took two visits to spoil us. 

Tonight I had The Omelette with chorizo, goat cheese, and guacamole. It also comes with potatoes (yummy, I'm sure) which this low carber had to pass on. No matter, it was the single best omelette I've had anywhere in the country, including those made by my beloved Southern California breakfast haunts.  

My wife tried the scallop entree and raved. The taste I had served notice I'll be ordering that next. Can't wait, either. 

As usual, Ronnie took care of us like the total pro he is and co-owner Brian Okin made it a point to say hello to us and everyone else. That, folks, is what professionals who really care about their work do when time allows. 

I'm not sure Broadview Heights would have been ready for Cork and Cleaver five years ago. Heck, when I heard about it I wasn't sure it was ready now, The good news is that the area has responded and responded big. Getting four stars from the PD's reviewer--a very rare event--also helped bring people in the first time. No doubt in my mind the food, service and decor will bring them back a second...and third...

Looking VERY forward to visit number three."}
{"text":"C&C had a nice decor inside:  subdued and intimate.  We started off with a few drinks and the seared scallop plus calamari appetizers.  They were all nicely presented and delicious--especially the calamari.  We then had the Beet and mushroom from the Greens menu.  I would definitely recommend the Beet but the mushroom salad was just too plain--fancy lettuce topped with a few slices of mushroom.  For our entrees, we had the Pork Paprikash and the Lamb Gnocci--both nicely sized.  The Lamb was definitely the better of the two as the Paprikash was quite a bit on the overseasoned side.  After the above, we were stuffed--no room for desert.  All in all a good meal but not great."}
{"text":"1st time dining here with a group was disappointed food was some what warm. Would not recommend this place and will not go back. Service and wine was great."}
{"text":"Good looking room, attentive service, creative menu. Very nice attention to locally grown foods. The chef had interesting pairings. Our party had veal schnitzel served over spaetzel and roasted corn. We also had lamb shanks served over gnocchi with tazecki sauce. We also had chicken with mushroom confit with asparagus and potato salad. All the dishes were wonderful. We all agreed that we would return."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to eat at cork and cleaver a few times and have loved everything I have ever had.  The flavor combinations are wonderful, and they have a unique menu that changes with the seasons.  I LOVE the stellar drink- peaches and cream and so delicious.  The wait staff and chefs are so personable.  Make sure to call ahead as the seating area is a little small."}
{"text":"Now...I would have given this place 4 stars had it not been for our server who single handedly deserves 5. The service here was stellar from the moment we walked in. 

To begin our meal, my fiance and I ordered the Rueben ribs, which we knew came highly recommended before we ordered. The ribs were cooked to perfection, falling off the bone. I also enjoyed the tiny pieces of cornichons scattered about the dish as well as the drizzle of thousand island dressing.

The bread that accompanied the meal was complemented with spinich butter. I have never had spinich in my butter, but it reminded me of a more subtle chive butter, which I quite appreciated.

I ordered the salmon. The chef recommends the salmon to be cooked medium rare; I, on the otherhand, ordered it medium as I usually do. It came out medium rare. I did not send it back because it was delicious. This salmon was so fresh. There was a dill sauce that I wish had a little stronger dill flavor, however. I do not like beets, which are a side to this dish, so I replaced them with brussel sprouts, a nice replacement in my opinion. 

Our server did notice that my salmon came out medium rare and not medium. She made sure I did not want to send it back and was very concerned with whether I enjoyed the meal or not. I tried to assure her it was great, but despite my protests that is was delicious she insisted in buying me a glass of wine since it came out more rare. I really appreciate her taking such care of us and making this experience as wonderful as it was.

My fiance orderd the duck. For someone who does not love duck...I thought it was very good, also cooked medium rare. 

Both dishes came with trendier grains: quinoa and barley. I'm not a rice lover and mashed  potatoes can become so redundant; so, this was a nice alternative to the usual sides.

Nestled in a strip mall, you would pass it unless you knew it was there. Once inside, I felt it had an old fashioned restraunt feel ( because I sat on the bar side) but with really modern light fixtures! The candle holders and the lights above were made from repurposed wine and beer bottles. The server said she helped cut the glass to make these really cool decorations. I do love new DIY ideas and can appreciate helping the environment by reusing these glass bottles.

Anyway, it's a nice place for a romantic date night. The staff will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant. Completely enjoyable! We split the scallops and polenta appetizer. It was plenty for 2. Two large scallops. I had the salmon with beets and sweet potatoes and my husband had the pork paprikash. Both were excellent. For dessert we had the apple pirogies with Brie and ice cream. Very seldom do we get a perfect meal. This was it. The staff was also friendly and accommodating. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Apparently they are so successful at the Cork & Cleaver that they do not need business. My wife and I walked in today and sat at the bar for 5 minutes while the bartender talked to a local news celebrity. Apparently he was so enamored with her that he could not bother to tear himself away to wait on us. After waiting for close to five minutes, we just got up and walked away and he didn't even try to stop us. Must be good times over the Cork & Cleaver where money is not needed from customers other than local celebrities."}
{"text":"Ever had a meal where nothing, and I mean nothing, is overlooked? That's what we experienced at Cork and Cleaver. There were five of us including my five year old daughter. We started with a bottle of wine and the ribs and chicken wings for appetizers. The ribs came with a thousand island dressing slaw, and the meat literally fell off the bone as you picked it up. Not even a teensy bit greasy. Pumpernickel? bread with a spinach butter was so good my five year old had a whole piece. For dinner, my mother in law had the C&C pasta custom made to her liking. She was very pleased, and we all tried it. My sister-in-law and husband both had the steak with buttery smooth flavor cooked flawlessly. I had the short rib by suggestion of our waitress, and I was not disappointed. In fact, I so appreciated that even the parsley had a squeeze of lemon and really enhanced more than the color of my dish. My daughter had the off-the-menu macaroni and cheese that was good enough for an adult to enjoy. Servings were perfect in size and artfully prepared. I should have taken more photos but it was so delicious I couldn't wait to taste it. There wasn't a glass on our table that got below half full and while we were all pleasantly full, we decided to try the maple bacon bread pudding and share for the table. When we ordered, my daughter pouted that she wanted cookies. I didn't even think about it, but our incredible waitress heard her and brought a small plate of perfectly small, bite size cookies. My daughter was so excited that she dropped her to-go box in her hand - thank goodness it was well closed. I'd tell you what they tasted like but she didn't even offer to share which was okay because the bread pudding made a perfect end to a flawless meal and service experience. We definitely recommend. So glad we found it on Yelp."}
{"text":"What a gem in a non-descript strip mall location in suburban Broadview Hts. I feel like this place belongs downtown Cleveland, or even the San Francisco Bay Area.  Our server helped with wine choices as we discussed meal options and the pairings were perfect with each meal. We started with the scallops and salad with wild mushrooms as appetizers. Scallops were perfectly prepared and were very delicate yet flavorful. The salad was rich and succulent with the earthiness of the mushrooms and a touch of truffle oil - oooh, it smelled so divine.  For dinner, I had the pork paprikash which had a unique twist - the pork shoulder was shredded and then packaged nicely in this little \"loaf\" that was possibly grilled on all sides - spaetzle were paprika and a lovely color and the sauce traditional but not overly sour cream based (I only wish there was more sauce). We also had the gnocchi which was also a unique twist incorporating flavors of a gyro - lamb meat, tzatziki sauce, tomato, cucumber - very rich and wonderful together. Sadly we had no room for dessert! I will come back to try again next time I am in town. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Incredible, delicious food!  The reuben ribs...ooohhh...

The only (slight) downside was that it was cold in there.  I am often cold, true, but I was almost shivering in there."}
{"text":"Sit at Ronnie's bar, he'll take care of you. Always good cocktails, always great food. Was hesitant about the gnocchi and ate it on recommendation...best choice ive made in weeks."}
{"text":"This place is a little piece of Tremont or Ohio City smacked into the middle of Parma/Broadview. They have great food and an upscale, yet trendy atmosphere that the area has been lacking tremendously. This place is in a little strip, but don't be put off by the location. Once we walked inside, we were greeted by romantic lighting and a great dining space.

The food and cocktails are to die for. I ordered the mule made with vanilla-infused whiskey. I'm not much of a dark liquor person, but the bartender worked magic with this cocktail, and made my delicate taste-buds lust for more. The cocktails and pumpernickel bread with house-made spinach spread were a great opening act for the smorgasbord to come.

My SO and I ordered a plate of the chicken and waffles for our starter. All I have to say is, \"WOW!\" This dish was much more than your standard waffle and chicken strips. The chicken itself was a patty blended with herbs and spices, and the waffle had a great texture; it almost didn't need the syrup (though it was a nice touch). I ordered the pork paprikash for my main dish, and my date ordered the bangers platter. The pork was heavenly; it wasn't heavy on the pasta and it didn't need to be. The huge hunk of melt-in-your-mouth pork shoulder did all of the talking for this dish. The sausages were also fantastic and came with a variety of homemade dipping sauces to suit any tastes. 

I'm so happy this part of town has something to be proud of in the foodie scene. Instead of venturing downtown, it's going to be really nice to get a fantastic dining experience close to home. The food is unmatched, the service is great, the parking is free, and everything is very reasonably priced. I am eager to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a quiet little gem of a restaurant, hidden on Broadview road, in an unassuming strip mall. They have a unique variety of dishes, for those with a little bit of adventure their menu has things like lamb, bone marrow, and a few other surprises. I believe they update it often, based on what they get from their farm - our lovely waitress filled us in on their story, but yes, they have their own farm, pretty cool! 

The dining room had a low light ambiance to it, with a bar and also a few tables on the outside patio. Service was attentive and friendly, even when my sister and I were making a ridiculous scene and thrashing around about a moth that continued to harass our table. I'm sure we looked like idiots, but anyways - Our food was great, the mussels dish came with ramen broth and a few noodles, the Brussels with blue cheese, and the winner of the meal was the pork paprikash. The pork was shredded/pulled and molded into a log and surrounded by yummy spaetzel and paprikash sauce. It was so weird looking, but delicious! We finished with a brulee and it was perfect and light. 

Overall, I like this place. I do find menu prices to be high for the area, but they are definitely dishing out creative, tasty food with fresh ingredients - and it sets them apart from the rest. Don't feel like making the trek downtown to try something hot and new? Go to Cork and Cleaver instead!"}
{"text":"Came here for some after dinner drinks on a Saturday night with some friends. I've been here before for dinner and it wasn't bad and we were in the neighborhood already so we figured we'd stop for some drinks. 

Based on their recs I tried the ADC-not my favorite unfortunately. I much preferred the Mason Mule...mmm ginger beer. 

Service was a little slow for just drinks. It almost seemed like the waitress didn't want to serve us since we were only ordering drinks. 

Might come back to try dinner again and to try the Ruben ribs."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  I went there with my girlfriend and enjoyed this restaurant immensely.  Staff was quick and very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Cork & Cleaver last night. Having never been there before, I was impressed by our entire experience. We sat at the bar, and the bar tender was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We started with the Rueben Ribs, which are phenomenal. For entrees I had the short ribs, which literally melted in my mouth. My dining partner had the gnocchi, which what they are known for. And holy cow, I see why. They were incredible! On a whim I ordered the country fried brownie.... it was a heavenly experience. The caramel sauce they used it an other worldly experience. All drinks and wines that we had were great. This is a must go place. Such a big fan, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment!

We often find Yelp to be a great tool in aiding our search for good places to visit.  Well, this time the Yelp reviews led us astray!

One of our dinners was very, very salty.  Yuk.

We decided to split the salad with the poached egg on it -- thought that would be interesting.  It was -- the egg was RAW.  We questioned the waitress about it and she explained that ti was poached. Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly \"in authority\" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.  

The beer list was minimal and undistinguished and the wine list was extensive.  Both wine and beer were v-e-r-y expensive for an undistinguished  little joint in a strip plaza.  I have never paid $6 for a 12oz bottle of beer before.  

So, here's our score ...
Food quality:  2.5 - 3
Food quantity:  3
Food value:  3
Beverage variety: 2
Beverage value: 1
Service: 2
Ambiance: 3

Would we return?  Not a chance!  We'll leave it to others to heap praise on this place -- while we will avoid it and advise others to do so as well."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to come here since it opened - well worth the wait. 

While situated on the end of a plaza, in Parma? Broadview Hts? Seven Hills?... That neck of the woods, don't underestimate it. It's every bit the experience as at one of the Tremont/Ohio City/CLE restaurant greats.

Make a reservation. It fills up quick. Casual dress through.

Great service - super duper knowledgeable staff. Everyone on the floor could give you every detail of every menu item.

The cocktail list & beer menu were short and sweet. I'm not even into whisky, but the Mason's Mule was awesome: vanilla infused whiskey, muddled oranges, and ginger beer. Highly recommend.

I also think the confit wings are a must. They were so umami & tender inside and so crispy on the outside. And the blend of honey, jalapeño, and orange slivers - wow.

The beet salad, I must warn, is, get this: a beet salad. It was incredible, but don't be expecting a bed of greens. I almost think I would order this for dessert next time. Chocolate vinaigrette?? Oh yeah!!

The bangers had to have been homemade. Tender, bursting with flavor, and served with perfectly complimenting condiments. We couldn't pick a favorite between the three types of sausages: each was very different and the best ever.

GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Where am I?  Broadview Heights?  I could just as easily be in trendy spots like E. 4th, Tremont or Ohio City.

Cork and Cleaver is a MUCH needed addition to the bland suburban offerings that surround it.  

We first started our with the Whiskey Fizz and their version of the Moscow Mule.  The whiskey had been aged in house with spices and herbs, and everyone was amazed at the smooth, yet strong taste.  My Mule was great.  Having just gotten one at Society Lounge for exactly twice the price, I was more than pleased with my mule!  I thought it tasted similar, if not better to the expensive mule in the \"trendier\" spot.

We started out with the frites with gravy - a glorious poutine with sausage and savoryness.  There was plenty to share, so much so that we could have halfed the order and still had a good appetizer.  For our entrees, we had the fancy omelet, the Gnocchi with Lamb and the Fried Chicken with Mac/Cheese.  Yum!  Everything was top notch!  The omelets was one of the best, I think I'd ever had (I know, an Omelet usually just tastes like an omelets!), the Mac/Cheese was to die for and who knew a fancy gyro would be so satisfying!  It was excellent food, hand-made and obviously very fresh!  As I was leaving, I saw a whole pig being broken apart in the kitchen - this stuff is done right!

For desert we had the pear cassolute with brie ice cream and the apple pierogies.  Yum!  Nothing was too sweet, but the flavors married so well with one another. 
 
Overall, I was blown away!  Great drinks, fresh food.  Very fork to table, and who would have thought you'd find that in Broadview Heights?!?!"}
{"text":"Another stellar review for Cork and Cleaver! Went here in May for the anniversary of going on the first date with my husband six years ago! Had a fantastic meal and great drinks. Service was impeccable, as always, and our server kept us up to date on the Browns draft that was happening during our meal, too (which my husband appreciated!). We started with the calamari appetizer and I had the gnocchi lamb dish that was their take on a gyro. Wow it was incredible, best gyro ever! I do not remember what my husband had, it was the special that was not on the menu, but he enjoyed it as well. We did not have room for dessert, everything was so wonderful! I cannot wait to go back again."}
