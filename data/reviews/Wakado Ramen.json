{"text":"Wakado Ramen has very nice interior, very modern. On one corner of the resturant it looks as thou they make their own noodles. I could be wrong.   I ordered a charsiu bun and their tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. The charsiu bun was not bad, the charsiu was juicy and not dry, the bun was broken in half (that made me sad), but it was sweet and a bit too thin. The ramen came almost at the same time and it was hot! it had veggies, egg, seaweeds and Charsiu. I tried their soup and it was salty and the flavour fell flat. The noodle was good thou! i am pretty sure they made their own noodles. The egg was perfectly cooked, pork had a good ratio of fat and meat, and the veggie was mix green (nothing special).   If their broth was a bit more flavourful it would have made this bowl of ramen a success! but for $13.50 for good noodles, not so much. Ill try it again in the future for sure."}
{"text":"This place has just opened only a couple of weeks. Service and food was good. Their menu is quite small with only gyoza, edamame and 4 different kinds of ramen . The gyoza was ok. I got the Tonkatsu black ramen and it was very flavourful  and the chasiu was very good. The only feedback I would have for the restaurant is not to put hot tea in a tall plastic tumbler cup as it's too hot to hold. Definitely should invest in tea cups."}
{"text":"It's disappointed. The name of shop sounds like Japanese owned shop, but the taste was way too far to Japanese proper Ramen"}
{"text":"These people are awesome. I wasn't even their customer and they let me use her bathroom. So polite and nice. I appreciate it very much. :);)"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for a quick easy dinner out. The shop is relatively small but it wasn't very busy when we stopped in, there are tables and a bar area where you can sit. Our server was very friendly when interacting with us and taking our order. We both ordered the tonkatsu ramen. Overall the ramen was pretty good, the noodles had a good amount of chew to them, the pork was flavourful and tender and as with all ramen it was a good sized portion for the standard ramen price for Calgary. There are other places in Calgary I prefer but if I was in the area I would stop in again."}
{"text":"Pretty average ramen. We got the gyoza, classic shoyu ramen, and tonkotsu black ramen. The two we wanted to try (miso ramen and mazemen) were not available yet sadly. They do make their own ramen noodles though, which is a plus in my book always. Their location is DT so the price is slightly above average, but you can get much better ramen for cheaper elsewhere. Also hot liquid in plastic glasses do not work, need to invest in some real tea cups."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Wakado and I was eagerly awaiting it's opening as I live right next door. When I saw that it finally opened, i was excited to give it a try.   I love the way the restaurant is set up - tables with a ramen bar. The decor is on point and the setting and ambiance has the makings of an awesome, local ramen joint with reliable, delicious ramen.   Unfortunately for Wakado, this is where my love story ends. I started with their Gyoza as an appetizer - well, I say started but realistically the appetizer arrived much after my ramen did.... which is not a big deal but....they were really not great dumplings either. They were pretty much clearly factory made frozen dumplings, but I suppose I shouldn't ever expect handmade goodness from a shop like this.   Let's get to the ramen. A ramen shop is about the ramen, and as we all know, ramen is about the broth. The ramen at Wakado needs a lot of work. The broth, quite frankly, is boring. I had the Black Garlic Ramen, and with the ramen of the same namesake at Jinya as reference, the broth lacked so much. The broth lacked the depth of flavour, it lacked the body and richness, and it lacked the layers that one should expect from a strong ramen broth.   The accoutrements left something to be desired as well. The Pork was again boring, and the toppings could have easily had more variety. The Egg - which again is a key component of a good bowl of ramen, lacked the flavour richness required from the soy marinade.   I was really rooting for amazing ramen from Wakado, but unfortunately this is still a miss. With the price point on the higher end of average, it's a double whammy against me returning to Wakado again. There are several better Ramen places in Calgary that are worth a visit.   Well, I suppose that's not true. I know one day I'll be lazy and i'll pay this place a visit again - the ramen is passable."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and it was superb.  I had the Mazemen Ramen, which comes with no broth but which has a savoury sauce at the bottom of the bowl. In the bowl in addition to the excellent, toothsome ramen noodles are corn,  perfect soft half of an egg, mushrooms of some description and absolutely stunning pork belly cut into chunks. This pork was the best part of the meal and I could have eaten an entire plate of it- completely delicious. I also got a small order (that's 4 pieces) of the gyoza, which was a bit thicker pasta than I am used to but very tasty.  I almost never drain every morsel from a bowl of ramen. I did so today.  I agree with comments about odd choice of plastic tumblers for scorching hot tea, but I got ice water so no problem."}
