You don't think a fish and fries can be so good and fresh"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nicer place for pub style food, Mccarty pub is a great spot!  When driving down Airport Road, traffic moves fast so keep your eyes open for a large green sign that marks the parking lot entrance.

The pub is part of the historical Caledon inn and there are different options for seating.  There is a main dining room, fine dining area upstairs, and a nice patio as well.
The inn is also a venue for weddings and functions and the James McCarty pub is priced accordingly (a bit high).  The menu is not huge, but most people will find something that they like.

The fish and chips ($15) is a great choice!
The portion was huge and the fish was fresh.
You can upgrade to sweet potato fries for (+$3).

We ordered the chicken fingers ($14)...the portion was not so large.
5 chicken strips which were moist and crispy.
And we never got our sweet potato fries... but the regular fries were still good.
It just wasn't a lot of food for $14.

And, my draft beer was $6.50.

Overall, I like this pub.  
The service is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. 
However, I find the prices a bit steep."}
{"text":"This place was one of those wonderful, \"as I drive by\" accidents - I can't wait to go back.

The service is incredible, the place is super cozy, the food is excellent, and I literally didn't want to leave.

The menu offers something for everyone, and the patio is large and nicely decorated.

Yes, it is fairly far, and yes, it is off the beaten path, but it is definitely worth a visit - I know it is on my to do list, for the near future.

Will repeat, many times."}
