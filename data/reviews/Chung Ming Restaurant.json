{"text":"I advise you, DO NOT GO HERE. I found a cockroach in my lo mein, threw up, went back to the store and they told me that I lied & PUT IT IN MY FOOD. I demanded something happen to compensate me, but all they said is because I took the food home, there was no way to tell how the cockroach got in the food. They don't even deserve 1 star! How dare they tell me I put a cockroach in my food. Sickening customer service."}
{"text":"Great service got my food in a descent amount of time on a busy Friday night. Food was good. Normal tasting chicken low mein and crab puffs. Taste great no problems what's so ever."}
{"text":"We ordered this as delivery on a Saturday afternoon. Delivery time seemed decent.   Our order got mixed up and our Lo Mein with Shrimp Combination Dinner ended up a House Lo Mein without the egg roll, fried shrimp and order of fried rice that comes with the combo. They did come back later with one shrimp and one egg roll, but the fried rice never made it.   Here's the rundown of the food we ordered: \"Po Po\" Platter: The ribs were red, sticky and tasted lightly of candy, and they didn't have much meat on them. The meat stick was like jerky, but not too sweet. The fried shrimp was a mouthful of batter with a shrimp sliver and you only get two.  The egg rolls were in no way large and more like crisp spring rolls, but the flavor was decent. The crab puffs were nothing special, just wads of cream cheese in a fried wonton.    House Lo Mein was fine, kinda bland with not much for vegetables but big pieces of meat.    Mu Shu Pork was juicy with lots of veg but no mushrooms. The pork was tender. The \"crepes\" seemed to be flour tortillas. Can't say about the traditional egg part as we ordered without due to allergy. Overall this was the best dish of the meal, but still nothing impressive.  The meal came a free order of crab puffs, so there's that.  Total cost with tip: 32.40  We're probably not going here again. There are simply better and more affordable places.  I was going to give this place a 3 but the description of 3 is \"A-ok\" and this was more \"Meh, I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Came here for a carry out order.  Food was nothing special.  Not horrible, but not memorable either.  The lady behind the counter, although not unpleasant, was not very welcoming either.  Think I'll stick to my faves, Big Heng and Golden Rice Express.  A bit farther away, but better than here, I think."}
{"text":"They need to STOP ! putting there flyers all over the apartment i work for. Its trashing up the complex ! All the ones he put out today about 45 min ago are all over the ground. This is not the first time this matter has been addressed he is trespassing and will have the police called one HIM !\""}
{"text":"Just to try it out. It was discussing! Their virson of spring rolls were a joke. Food was cold and I brought it back before I even drove away. Stay far away from this place!! On the good side, I did get a complete refund immediately. Maybe they know what I just had to find out the hard way. I've had better \"spring rolls\" or egg rolls from J in the Box 30 year's ago when not even being stoned!! I wish there were minus stars!! Avoid this place like trying not to get the flu!!!"}
{"text":"House fried rice was so delicious rice was soft moist, filled with all the best meats and seafood. Very good people."}
{"text":"For fast Chinese take-out or delivery this place is the best.  I recommend the Crispy Cantonese noodles and, believe it or not, the sweet and sour chicken.  I know you are probably thinking \"Sweet and Sour Chicken!?!?WHAT?, next review\" but this reviewer loves dim sum, sushi, pho, and other delicious asian cuisine.  Try the two items, with chicken, I usually order pork with chinese food but have found the this restaurant does better with their chicken, and let your tastebuds make the decide if I was lying."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese delivery/restaurant around but it is affordable. Food is average, sometimes bland sometimes ok. Hit and miss, and we've ordered here an average of twice a month for the past 3 years.   Expecting high end Chinese dishes? Don't order here. The portions are decent size, sometimes. I told you it's hit and miss with these cats.  Price is ok, they do charge delivery fee (they just don't advertise that they do). All in all, we order from here mainly for the convenience and not much more.   Thank you ladies and gentlemen"}
{"text":"We ordered some take out tonight my Husband loved his Mongolian Beef..n I really liked my Chicken Chow Mein.....very fresh large portions..we were happy with this delivery n food."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service, I have ordered delivery from Chung Ming on 4 different occasions and I've put up with the HORRIBLE service because their food it decent however inconsistent... 3 different times when placing my order I've requested additional sauce for my Kung Pao Chicken, I have never received additional sauce EVER! This final time, after my order arrived I called Chung Ming, I was greeted by their generally rude order taker and told she told the cooks a double order. After a few more questions, I realized they don't give a crap.. The owner I was told does NOT speak English therefore I could not communicate with her. So I'm left with a glorified hostess that doesn't give a crap and  an owner of a business that can't communicate to the greatest percentage of her patrons. I am done. I am tossing the Chung Ming menu into the trash!! There is a Chinese restaurant on every corner, (between every nail salon and tattoo parlor that has gone out of business) and their is a new menu to a new restaurant rubber banded to my door knob weekly.."}
{"text":"Good food, and large portions. I suggest take out or delivery. Haven't had any major issues."}
{"text":"Ate here today for my first time, overall great Chinese food for a good price. I eat a lot of \"hole in the wall\" Chinese places and I must say the quality here is far and above what I would have expected. I'm surprised to see other reviews so different. I ordered pork fried rice, which is some of the best pork fried rice I have ever had, and sesame chicken. The chicken was great, had good texture and flavor. Probably not all white meat, but I was raised to eat all meat, so it was delicious to me. My lady ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the breading was amazing. Ever so crispy and just perfect. We also ordered crab puffs (which I tried for the first time) and those were great as well!! The service was fantastic and the tea was also very good. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good quick Chinese option."}
{"text":"Long delayed review,  I ordered the beef combo here about 4 month ago, once I started chewing i noticed the beef was extremely ages and something didn't smell right. At the time i wasn't sure if it was the garlic sauce they were using or ingredients gone bad. 3 hours later My stomach started killing me and was at urgent care to receive the antibiotics to remedy the food poison I got form this place. I will say this was like my 10th  time ordering here, first 9 times were okay."}
{"text":"The food is incredibly good! Owner is a little Asian kind hearted woman  God bless her.   I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today with my hubbs. Ordered Crab Puffs, Mongolian Beef and Fried Rice. It's hard for me to describe my experience here. When we came in the restaurant the waiter(?) asked us if we had a to go order. When we said we wanted to stay he seemed honestly surprised. I immediately felt uncomfortable and my husband and I exchanged a look but sat down anyway.   Our drinks consisted of a single can of soda (split) even though we ordered two drinks and two Styrofoam cups with a hunk of ice in each. We ordered and the food came quickly and was decent. That is the only reason this place deserves a single star. The food we experienced seemed fresh and tasted good, despite what other reviewers experienced. It was the general \"get the f*$k out of here,\" attitude we received via our \"service\" that striped this place of stars.   No refills offered, no napkins, and everything was served on to go plates except our crab puffs, which was really odd. The unwelcome for a sit down meal was so strong it was palpable. We left as quickly as possible and we definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"So, we ordered here for delivery once before our last visit, and the food was good enough to order again. This last time, emphasis on last, we ordered and they said it would be an hour and a half for delivery. Not a huge deal, even though we were trying to avoid going out. So, we asked if it would be faster if we picked up and they said yes, only 30 minutes. After the 30 minute went by, my wife drove to pick it up and told me after another 10 minutes of waiting and watching other people pick their food up and leave, she asked the lady if it would be much longer and she said it would be a few more minutes. After another ten minutes went by she inquired again, in which she was told that they don't have anymore crabpuffs. My wife was upset enough to ask for a refund and she is one of the most easy going people I've ever met. Also, I didn't see the restraunt, but my wife said it was dingy and dirty and won't ever order from them again."}
{"text":"Came in the other day. Order crispy noodles and chicken plate. Very nice and clean inside. Ordered my food and was greeted by a very nice lady. The menu was awesome and they made my food very quick. Got home to eat it and was very pleased. Tasted great and fresh, not over cooked like allot of places."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! I ordered Orange chicken and Mongolian beef for lunch here. I get home and to my surprise the chicken is all bread, and has a hard and chewy texture. I'm not even sure what I was eating was actual chicken. The Mongolian beef was okay, nothing great and the flavor was bland. The fried rice was edible, but had an oily taste to it. The egg drop soup almost made throw up. It had a metal aftertaste to it, like it was sitting in an aluminum pot for who knows how long. And it was guey. The shrimp wontons had a small piece of crusty shrimp in them with a lot of breading. The board of health definitely needs to check this place out. I just hope I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not worth the money.  Crab Rangoon was just cream cheese and no crab Chicken friend rice was sub par and the chicken was not very good"}
{"text":"My son (7 yrs old) and I decided to try this place today and it wasn't too bad it was actually pretty good.   The location is at a strip mall and upon entering you will notice the establishment windows are dirty and have smudges on them indicating it probably has been awhile since they have been cleaned.  We were welcomed by the cashier who was very friendly and cheerful and constantly smiling. It was genuine but I am sure it's because she was holding her beautiful little 13 month old daughter too. She was so precious!  We ordered the beef and broccoli for $8.75 which included two big scoops of fried rice, one egg roll and one golden shrimp. Prices are cheaper during lunch 11AM -3PM we were there at 330PM.  We waited about 10-12 minutes for our food as it was freshly prepared and served nice and hot. The beef and broccoli were on point as well as the rice and egg roll. We ordered an appetizer of 8 golden shrimp they were huge but had too much breading on them we love shrimp but will skip the appetizer next time.  My dogs enjoyed them though hahaha  There are no fountain drinks but only two liter sodas for $3 a piece and they were room temperature with no ice available. We declined and had room temperature water and then went to Circle K for a polar pop after our meal.  I also thought it was cool that they had a huge poster with pictures of their entrees so that you could see what your meal looks like before your order. Its helpful if you want try something different next time.  Speaking of which there will definitely be a next time for us. We will visit during lunch for the cheaper prices and delicious food since our favorite go to place Chen Wok at 35th Ave & Thunderbird closed :-(   Chung Ming has delicious fried rice and next time I will order it with the shrimp mmmm"}
{"text":"This is an excellent hole in the wall Chinese spot!  Great for pick up or delivery, the inside is so small I do not know if I would ever eat in!  The food is good; great general Tso's chicken, HUGE PORTIONS!  The rice and noodles are decent, crab puffs are great!  Quick and easy go-to spot for Chinese Take-out."}
{"text":"This place is DE-LISH. I love Chinese food, but have a hard time finding a place where the food is good. It's a small, strip mall place. I've had the lemon chicken combination meal and it was fantastic. Perfectly crisp chicken with a light, tangy lemon sauce. The egg rolls are the biggest I've ever seen and are yummy. Their lo mein was good too. Only draw back is I won't eat in, it's next to a nail salon and smells like one. This is a great take out place though."}
{"text":"Among the many nuances of American culture that I have yet to grasp is the fucking obsession with crab puffs.  With the way people chomp at the bit for cream cheese and imitation crab you'd think it cured herpes (oh, btw, if you're reading this, I tested negative, so yay!).  Like pringles and ritalin on a day \"you really need to concentrate\", people can't seem to pop just one. What initially appears to be [insert Chinese eatery]'s attempt at offering you a robust and well-rounded combo becomes a cruel and vicious taunt. Yeah, looks like you're getting a bag of those to go, champ.   So much for your \"Ethnic food is healthier than McDonald's\" approach to dieting.  Some people are willing to endure some pretty tedious inconveniences in the name of these morsels.   Clarice W and I once waited for 25-30 minutes after our meal was finished for an order of puffs at Hope Kee, our brilliant plan to eat lunch at a supermarket and spare ourselves the lunch crowd thwarted by hordes of crab-craving take-out customers.  Last week, my boss suggested we order lunch from Chung Ming, because, according to the coupon, if your order was over 15 dollars you got a free order of crab puffs.  Three people ordering lunch barely put us at the 12 dollar mark.  Let's get soup. No, fried wontons. No, bbq pork ribs.  I got it. Let's get an order of crab puffs, so we'll get TWO orders of crab puffs.  Yo dawg. I heard you like crab puffs so we put crab puffs in your bag of crab puffs so you can eat crab puffs while you eat crab puffs.   The real zinger in this story is that the crab puffs at CM kinda suck.  They aren't bad, but compared to the sweet tangy-ness of their orange/lemon chicken or the robust spice of their kung pao or their eggrolls that would make Chipotle blush, a gloop of cheese and crab doesn't really cut the wasabi.  Still, it's a staple of Americanized Chinese cuisine and is helpful in getting your order to the right total cost so you don't have to pay a \"delivery fee\".   So, come because the crab puffs lured you in, but for the love of Eris find a different reason to stay. Your nutritionist (i.e. bf/gf who took a nutrition class in college) will thank you."}
{"text":"We have had food from Chung Ming many times. It is always delicious and the portions are very big. We get at least two meals out of it. Prices are reasonable. This is our go to for delivery, have never eaten at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Got a flyer in the mail thought we would check it out. Called to place a to go ordered was asked to be put on hold, which is fine no problem with that. The problem lines in their hold consisted of being placed on the counter to listen to their personal conservations for over 5 minutes. At which point we hung up - guess we're off to check out the next place. We won't be trying again considering there's plenty of other Chinese/Asian variety in this area."}
{"text":"I love the food and the portions are well worth the money, The place is not the cleanest but I can careless because my food came out freshly hot & ready. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall restaurant. We ordered take-out and was a little skeptical about the quality when we picked up the food. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the Mu Shu pork , potstickers and lo mein. My boyfriend ordered what he thought were spring rolls, only to bite into one and discover it was shrimp. He only had one bite, however maybe an hour later he was laying in the fetal position on the bed clutching his stomach, and then spent the rest of the night throwing up. I ate everything the same as him, except the shrimp, indicating this is the likely culprit of his illness. Disappointing because the rest of the food was okay bordering on good but I do not think we will be trying Chung Ming again knowing the safety of their food now."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery from a flyer that was placed on our door.  I wasnt feeling very well today and i wanted soup. i asked for 1/2 won ton and 1/2 egg drop soup which i order ALL The time at other restaurants and They refused. No reason why just a refusal. It's that same amount of soup just mixed. I was told \"no substitutions, you pick one\" very poor customer service.  As far as the food, it was ok. nothing special, just ok. sweet and sour pork is all breading. u cant hardly taste the pork. Fried rice has nothing in it. no peas, no carrots just rice and soy sauce."}
{"text":"This was the only place that delivered within my area and I was hoping it would be good. Well it wasn't. It was dry and cold and it took way longer than they said it would be delivered. I was highly disappointed and I wish I could have gotten my money back. No good. I hate being so negative too."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for over 5 years.  Tonight we ordered our usual and by delivery.  Part of our order was missing.  Immediately called and reported the following Hot & Sour soup had nothing but a couple of vegetables and no tofu , in which I had ordered extra tofu for a dollar extra. Wow Wonton Soup had two pieces of broccoli and 2 carrots.  The young lady on the call first said the ingredients are what they are.  I've order the same thing for over five years!  I know what is normal ingredients, when I drove the food back packaged just as they delivered, they actually accused as I was showing them the problem, the young girl said I'm a liar, the older woman talked in her native language which was rude, I then just said give me my money back.  What's a shame is the treatment to a loyal customer who has order several times and to be accused of a liar.  Terrible CUSTOMER service and SO sad."}
{"text":"For a place we drovr past and even ate qhyt Shwarma King called food. We got a flier on the door. So after running a few arrends called in the order with standard 15 wait time. Walked in after another guy, they inquired if I called in an order. I paid and decided to snap a few photos for their  Yelp profile. Went home and was Blown Away  Sizzling Roce Soup.... My wife was extremely happy  General Tso's Chicken diner... For my son was the best General Tso's I have ever had in 20 years House Fried Rice. ... Very flavorful, not greasy and fresh. Pot  Stickers were delicious.  Free order of Pork Fried Rice was perfect.   We suffered after New York Wok sold  Now we have a great go to  Time to hit the gym"}
{"text":"I really like their food. It's always been yummy and delivery is always fast. They are one of the few places that I loooove their tofu dishes it's hard to find ones that taste so good! And as a bonus if you order more then $15 you can get free order of crab puffs"}
{"text":"Very fresh food! Served HOT! They are open for a full lunch for a very fair price.  I will be ordering for delivery."}
{"text":"My sister ordered food and we found some beef still raw and uncooked. Totally lost my appetite. The restaurant had them come and replace our order with a fresh batch. Just beware."}
{"text":"The food was average. Nothing to write home about but edible. Portions are large so you will have some left over if it's just 2 of you. We got the Mongolian Beef and the Chicken Lo Mein and an order of crab puffs. The menu says the mongolian beef is spicy, but if you are someone who really likes spicy food like my boyfriend and I, you may want to ask for it to be spicier. The Lo Mein was a tad bit on the salty side for me but not by much and the crab puff were great. It's nice to have something else for delivery besides pizza, so we will order from here again."}
{"text":"OMG so disgusting. The chicken smelled rotten!! Literally rotten! and parts were actually old and dried out and purple! I have a video @   https://youtu.be/T3Fu15AAxVc  but its explicit so warning! I was absolutely revolted. I cant decide if the look of it is worse than the horrible smell."}
{"text":"Great portion size. The owner is wonderful they are very accommodating to their customers and The Food is always flavorful and fresh"}
{"text":"Chung Ming needs help. If you are searching for huge portions of over salted, goopy, inexpensive, less than average food, this is your place. Noodles are overcooked, almost mushy. Heavy breading on anything breaded. Room temp soda. When dining in, they provide the flimsiest paper plates and plastic forks. The place could use a good scrub-down. The Asian family that works/owns the place are all quite nice, though. Unfortunately, the hoodrat counter girl they hired could use a lesson in customer service and work ethic. She leaned on the counter, playing on her phone while customers waited for service, tables were dirty and spilled food was on the floor. She argued with me about the order I placed. I said that I ordered only 1 order of something- she did a ghetto neck roll and crazy eyes then told me 'Nuh-uh, you ordered TWO!' It was a simple misunderstanding that would not have been so bad had she had some class and respect."}
{"text":"The food is good. I've had Sweet & Sour Chicken, Hunan Shrimp, Shrimp with Vegetables, House Lo-Mein, Shrimp Chop Suey and Pork Fried Rice. All items were full of flavor and the prices are good too!"}
